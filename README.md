# Programming-Subreddit-Comments
Comments scraped from various programming language subreddits.
All comments are in the `./data/` folder. Each subreddit has its own folder.

In each subreddit folder are many text files containing all comments from the creation of the subreddit up to approximately June 22, 2019. Each file contains up to 1000 comments. Additionally, each file's name contains two UNIX epoch times, indicating the time range of the comments within that file.

I hope you guys find some use for all this data!
