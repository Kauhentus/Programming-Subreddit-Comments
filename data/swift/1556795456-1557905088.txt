Ok, so now can u tell me (you as an experienced developer) what is the advantage of using dependancy injection over Notifications for this case. Why and why not use them ? Thx
Modularity, Testability, Reusability, Separation of Concern. Actually Notifications is also just an implementation detail, of a callback pattern. It is that 'something' that you should pass in instance of, into your UIViewController/ViewModel. Rather than statically reference that 'something' from said Controller/ViewModel. TL;DR: never statically reference *Managers, *Factories, *Clients, *Services
I would say use only one delegate (protocol) as the view controller's owner (the coordinator) with as many methods as you need to pass user intent, but there's nothing stopping you from using an enum inside your delegate methods. Protocol driven architecture is very popular on iOS, perhaps more than ever with Swift. Calling it a delegate or owner or something else is a matter of preference it's still a great pattern with many benefits, including easier testing.
What version of [Ascii85](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii85)?
Adobe version, use case is encoding user input strings being passed to a blockchain
different types* of data
1. You shouldn't use 'delegate' on a shared class, because you will be able to have only one object that can receive location change events 2. If you want to receive this events in multiple objects (In "container controller" or in "main controller" as per you original question) you better use notification. 3. If you do want to use delegate, you should design you shared object so it can hold multiple delegates and dispatch events to all of them. But delegate should be stored using a weak reference (because obviously delegates should not be hold by your shared LocationService, a good article how to do this [https://marcosantadev.com/swift-arrays-holding-elements-weak-references/](https://marcosantadev.com/swift-arrays-holding-elements-weak-references/)) 4. If you want to use notifications, make sure that you inject notification center and use local property when subscribe and unsubscribe. This will enable you to write tests for you Controller easily and generally is a good taste to not use any global classes right-away, injecting them instead &amp;#8203; class Controller { private let notificationCenter: NotificationCenter init(notificationCenter: NotificationCenter = NotificationCenter.default) { self.notificationCenter = notificationCenter self.subscribeToLocationChanges() } deinit { self.notificationCenter.removeObserver(self) } private var locationNotificationObserver: Any? private func subscribeToLocationChanges() { self.notificationCenter.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(Controller.didChangeLocation(_:)), name: LocationDidChangeNotification, object: nil) } private func didChangeLocation(_ notification: Notification) { // process new location data } }
&gt;https://medium.com/@sajjon/5ebf32e9083a This is awesome. Thanks so much for sharing.
Thanks.
I wrote this a while back. It should help explain why Dependency Injection is useful and how to do it properly. [Dependency Injection](https://link.medium.com/Wk8OpFYwmW)
I think there are many ways to do this. One elegant solution would be to have an enum with associated values. That way you do different things for each possible different enum case. You would just have a switch statement in your viewDidLoad.
Thank you
First, to avoid `Any`, I would use a protocol that has all the common properties. Maybe `Animal`. Then you could switch by checking if `detailsData` can be casted to `Dog`, if so call `fillDogInfo` with `detailsData` casted to `Dog`. No need for `isDog`. It looks like the only variable that is different for `Dog` vs `Cat` in terms of display is the visibility of `contactButtonOutlet`. Unless this is only a snippet of your code and there're more differences between what the display looks like for `Cat` vs `Dog`, you could consider having a common `fillInfo` method and only toggle the visibility of `contactButtonOutlet`based on the type.
for better programmer - Rust for work - C++, Java, Python...
There are many differences between Dog and Cat actually. One has some properties like age, gender, height etc. that the other hasn't.
JavaScript is probably a language you should learn. There are many jobs (and also different types of jobs for web/frontend and backend) which are available. And for better or worse, JavaScript will probably still be useful long after many other languages have long past their prime. Fortunately, JavaScript is actually evolving so many of the original complaints/issues with the language either no longer exist or can be easily avoided. Not only is JavaScript evolving, if you do like a more static typed language, TypeScript is a great way to bridge and apply knowledge and patterns between a language such as Swift to JavaScript. &amp;#x200B; If you want steady employment, Java or C# are also great career choices especially for any mid-to-large company. I don't know of any mid-to-large tech company who doesn't employ at least some Java/C# developers.
Modularity, Testability, Reusability, Separation of Concern. Actually Notifications is also just an implementation detail, of a callback pattern. It is that 'something' that you should pass in instance of, into your UIViewController/ViewModel. Rather than statically reference that 'something' from said Controller/ViewModel. TL;DR: never statically reference \*Managers, \*Factories, \*Clients, \*Services
Agreed. Javascript may not be the most sophisticated language but it is very useful.
I have a question, why was a new buzz-term created (Dependency Injection) when in other languages, this idea is just called composition? Also why does the location service need to conform to the protocol, when it's a singleton implementation? In other languages, singletons do not often implement interfaces. I don't understand why it needs to be "injected" into the instance of that view controller, when it's a shared instance statically allocated...
Well if pressed I would say that Kotlin, Flutter(Dart) or React (Javascript) would be the best career advice. Learning programming languages is not so hard but understanding all libraries and the ecosystem is a whole different thing. Typically I get really productive in a language in a matter of days but I'm constantly Googling best practices and libraries.
Can't recall exactly but isn't this in the Cryptography framework?
Often what you'll find in this field is people feel better about themselves when they over-engineer a project. This is especially unnecessary in small projects, or in cases where very little code is actually needed. The simplest way is often the best one, because if another developer were to join the project it would be super clear how the code functions. Now, OC might work for a really big company that requires constant unit testing. This only makes sense for apps that are extremely complicated and have many points of failure. For your app, there is NO POINT in over-engineering.
\&gt;Is the grass greener on the iOS development side compared to full stack (LAMP) web development? If so why, and if not so much, why not? &amp;#x200B; In the context you're talking about--yes, very much so. There are frameworks and things to know for iOS as well, but it's not nearly the clusterfuck that web dev is. Swift, Objective-c, Xcode, cocoa pods (unfortunately--I hate cocoapods but they are the one bad part about iOS development), and basic ci/cd can go a really long way. Everything is much more streamlined and the community is not nearly as fragmented as web dev is. There's a thousand ways to make a website. There is really only 2 viable ways to make a production iOS app--a) Xcode/swift/objecive c, or b) react native. And 95% of that is option (a).
I would have both data types adhere to a protocol or inherit from a class with optional fields. The fields that don’t overlap will be ignored and the functions can be consolidated.
Can you check this piece of code and tell me what can I improve? [pastebin.com/ecsLGUJz](https://pastebin.com/ecsLGUJz)
Is it good? What can I improve? [https://pastebin.com/ecsLGUJz](https://pastebin.com/ecsLGUJz)
Well u could use a library with swear words and check your textfield text based on that
Are there really that many jobs that use Kotlin? I feel like most places are still on the java train.
Where i work they use it as much possible, but new comers never used it
Ive been exploring ios dev for few months now and just before opening reddit and seeing your post I thought “damn making ios apps is so straightforward compared to web dev”. Its not easy but at least you see your path much clearer.
Well do you want to work on green fields projects or maintenance? My preference is green fields and that's where the Kotlin jobs are. You should be able to read and maybe write a bit of Java but once you put Java on your resumé you'll be bombarded with grey boring enterprise jobs where the only joy you get out of your work is the way too elaborated patterns and tools you use to get something simple done. Java is a gateway into hell. And job security.
I'm not the person you're replying to, but I can try to answer. We might be operating under different definitions of "composition". As I understand composition, it's not exactly relevant here. Composition exists more as an alternative to inheritance, which isn't quite what is being discussed. As such, I don't think "dependency injection" is a new buzzword; it's a manifestation of the dependency inversion principle. The idea is that you're trying to decouple an object's dependencies from _how_ those dependencies are created. To tie this into your question about why a protocol/interface is desired here: it's because by passing in the protocol, your class is not restricted by the specific type of your singleton. By injecting the protocol, you're able to create a mock version of your singleton's type. That mock would conform to the protocol you're injecting, but the mock class would be able to define its own implementations for testing purposes.
That looks fine. I would try and abstract the shortInfo and longInfo generation. See if you can create a relatively simple function that doesn’t care about optionals or protocols.
I'm curious as to why you don't like Cocoapods
there is also flutter.
Do you have a suggestion? How?
Kotlin and Dart are pretty flavor-of-the-month and not that big for a career. If you want a solid career you should know one of the [top languages used](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/): Java, C, C++, Python, some form of .NET, and so on.
No, very few places use it. You might luck into one or two that are giving it a try but most companies stick to the big languages.
But it was a nice helpful video anyway. Apart from that misconception, I found bright and inspiring your approach to protocols as "multidimensional" entities :-) :+1
What part are you having trouble with? If you just need a code entry for someone typing, you can use the shouldChangeCharactersInRange method of the UITextFieldDelegate. Or you can drag in the editingChanged action from storyboard. Do you need a list of bad words to check against? I googled "list of bad words for filter" and found a text file with a bunch of them. Do you need help comparing the textField's text to the bad words? Strings have a .contains("") method that you can use.
The scope of the iOS development I'd say is a lot more broad. I love doing iOS development and that's what my field is. I can't stand doing web development for a lot of the reasons you've mentioned. There are still instances where companies or customers will want to try the new buzzy technology of the day(React Native, RxSwift, etc) but at the end of the day you still need to open up XCode and know how to write Swift(or Objective-C). UIKit for the most part is pretty well made and so is Swift generally, your main hurdles will probably be accounting for hardware limitations and new things like tableViews, the lifecycles of apps and other things that are more unique to mobile development. I think your knowledge of web will be beneficial to you when you start doing backend related work for an app and that LAMP stack might come in handy. If you want to really see how great iOS development is though take a look at how easy it is to connect a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart?authuser=1) database to an iOS app :) Also, not the only consideration, but you'll make a hell of a lot more money doing iOS dev over web Dev on average. Good luck!
Thanks, this is really helpful. When you say backend related work for apps, what exactly does that entail?
Most of what you'll be doing is interacting with different API's that are usually open source and really useful. Most of your time will be spent getting some data from an API with a get request, parsing the JSON it returns (or the error), and displaying it neatly on a screen in your app. I made a simple tutorial a while back that covers that if you're curious take a peak at it. Covers a lot of the basics. [Weather App For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ4fhA8T4LcQuL6jnpJBa3QLRFhpU-9Yd)
Hey OP, this is my plan as well! I'm tired of the web. Too fragmented like you said + It's completely broken from a surfer's point of view. They get tracked by companies that sell their private information to the highest bidder.
Which learning resources are you using?
I read this the first time as “furious” instead of “curious”. Oh well keep the upvote!
Carthage is better IMO because of quicker build times and decentralization
I started in web dev, then transitioned to iOS back in Obj-C days, and as soon as I could leave web dev I left for full-time mobile, and never looked back. Nowadays I do almost exclusively Swift stuff. I don’t think UIKit learning will be too steep. And there’s a lot of good learning resources out there. One thing I really like about (Apple) mobile is the known, limited set of hardware to support (when compared to web work or Android work). I also actually like the Apple app review process and delay. Back in web dev days, I’d have to work nights and early morning to do deployments at low-impact times. And management would always find some way to demand that we release (and break) something on a Friday at 4:59pm. With web you can click a button and instantly impact something that is live out there. With Apple, there is a little buffer between submitting an update and it going live, which forces a little bit of planning- management or clients cannot ask me to fix or release something live this very minute, because it cannot be done. I’ve done a bit of Android work as well but I really favor Apple stuff. Mostly just a personal preference. But again it also has to do with supporting limited, known hardware. I’ve done a fair bit of Bluetooth/BLE work on both platforms, and some of the lower end Android BLE chips are just shit. Causes some real headaches and weird behavior. All my Apple BLE work felt like it was waaay more stable and reliable. If you have any more specific questions, let me know and I’d be happy to try and answer.
Hello smart people. I need some help. If I was trying to fill a static text label with a text string from an array how would I do it? I basically have an array with quotes that has a function to pull and print a random string, and would like to have that random string wrap into my launch storyboard. I can format the text to auto resize, etc. But I'm new to swift and not sure how to reference my printed string. &amp;#x200B; I would appreciate any help, and can post what code I have if needed (it's not much)
https://www.raywenderlich.com
Just the official docs so far. Any recommendations?
Awesome, thanks!
Wow, this all sounds appealing, thanks. How do find yourself handling the database and "back-end" logic with apps?
What are you plans regarding iOS? Make you own apps or work for a company/consulting gigs?
Both lol, maybe not consulting.
I'm sure you can make good money at consulting or at a job. Not so sure when you make you own apps nowadays.
it’s to avoid side effects
No, that’s probably the best
It's been around a longtime, and in my experience is a lot simpler, and less error-prone but still a lot of libraries don't seem to be compatible. Is it difficult to make a library Carthage-installable?
For sure a good idea, OP. Swift is a great language. I noticed not a lot of people addressed your question about backends. I have done a lot of work on ios and the choices basically are: &amp;#x200B; \- CoreData on the device and for shared things, use CloudKit \- a sync framework like AppSync from Amazon (currently doing this) \- other database that supports the notion of sync (Couchbase announced new release that does this am) \- document-based, e.g. use UIDocument variants on the device and then interface them to something like Mongo &amp;#x200B; CoreData is actually quite powerful. The main thing that keeps me from using it these days is it's relational and does not handle tree/graph data well. &amp;#x200B; Originally Apple added syncing to CoreData and that was a complete disaster. Then CloudKit dropped. It's actually quite a pleasure to use. Of course, it means no interop with other platforms, which may or may not be a problem. &amp;#x200B; One nice thing about AppSync is its built around GraphQL, so you are defining an interface and then going in and out of them just using built in Decoder logic most the time. Low friction, hassle, and you can test things quite well. &amp;#x200B; Good luck
a library is Carthage compatible as long as it can be built as a framework from RayWenderlich: “There’s no need for Podspecs or a centralized repository for library authors to submit their pods to. If your project can be built as a framework, it can be used with Carthage. It leverages existing information straight from Git and Xcode.” https://www.raywenderlich.com/416-carthage-tutorial-getting-started
Thanks! This is really, really helpful. iOS sounds more and more appealing.
That's not something that's exclusive to the web, and definitely not a good reason for you to move.
If you mean like server-side db stuff, my easy answer is I don't, really- by that I mean in my case, that responsibility has usually fallen to other devs or other teams, and I just handle the mobile client side. If you mean db logic within the client, I recommend the framework "Realm" over Apple's CoreData. CoreData has a lot of boilerplate code, I just find Realm to be quicker to get running and easier to work with.
Thanks, I'll definitely go check out Realm
No prob! Realm is pretty slick.
I'm right there with you man, I've been learning iOS dev in my spare time because I want to build my own apps. My biggest issue is that I'm not willing to take a huge pay cut and go try to be a "junior" iOS dev somewhere when I'm mid-senior FED. I don't know if I'll ever work fulltime as an iOS dev. *shrug* Definitely agree on the fractured environment. Every year you better learn something new too. The newest, most obnoxious thing is that companies expect you to always have some backend skills too. They're slowly trying to turn frontend into fullstack. As far as IDEs, I use PHPStorm and I like it quite a bit. I think it does about as well as any IDE could for the web. My company pays for it.
Disclaimer: I'm a fullstack web developer that doesn't code in Swift. Yes, the web has lots of tools and different ways to build the same product, but that should be a good thing. You have lots of choice and there's a tool for basically anything you want to build. If finding a job with your stack is "impossible", then the stack you're choosing is way too niche. And let's not forget that you are able to target a much broader audience with a website/webapp than you would with only an iOS app. Just choose whatever technology you like and make sure it's relatively well known in the industry and a job won't be too hard to come by. As for no good IDEs... I find this a bit silly. I've heard many complaints about Xcode, and I'm not sure what you're doing with VS Code that made it unusable. I personally use WebStorm and I am lucky enough to have an educational license, but paying $200/year for something you use multiple hours daily shouldn't be an issue. But yeah, iOS app development will be a lot more straightforward than web development.
Angela Yu's iOS 12 uDemy course is great. https://www.udemy.com/share/100YzIB0Edd1tSRnQ=/
If you want to continue building your swift skills and try something new with regards to backend development, theres some server side swift frameworks out there, like Vapor or Kitura. Ray wenderlich has a [page dedicated to this](https://www.raywenderlich.com/server-side-swift) . I haven’t tried them myself yet but I’m planning to start learning soon.
Thanks for this thread. I was just thinking about switching to some frontend technology as I felt I am stagnating by only sticking to the mobile platform. But I see that every stack has its issues and whatever you choose to do, you will always run into problems and will always need to learn something new. There is no point in fretting over your desicions.
I still, for the life of me, cannot understand how there is no web index for cocoapods or carthage frameworks. Some of the github pages don’t even have installations guides on their readme page. It would be really nice and convenient if you could browse through various frameworks and their versions.
The fact that the web is "fractured" rather than having APIs and SDKs imposed upon you is a feature, not a bug.
I disagree that the purpose of types like URL is to "constrain usage". The Foundation type `URL` (a struct, not an enum, as the article suggests) does a practically useless level of validation. The initializer is failable but there's not many strings which cause it to fail, e.g., even useless junk like `URL(string: "?")` succeeds. Also, a recent Swift update changed many &lt;Type&gt;.Name from structs *back* into typealiases for plain Strings. The structs were simply too much of a pain in the rear. `URL` is a great type because URLs have a ton of internal structure, and it's extremely common to need to access or modify this structure. For any string value where this isn't the case, the Apple/Swift way is to just typealias a plain string. Apple *could* have made an Email (or NSEmail) type as part of Foundation. They've had enough time. NSURL has been around for decades, so this concept is not news to them. Mail was the first big NeXT app. Yet despite it all, every one of Apple's public APIs which takes an email address still takes it in the form of a plain string.
I was thinking about doing the same thing.
Hey Sajjon. I was wondering if you use anything for testing except then XCTest? I personally use cuckoo.
I made the switch from full stack web dev to iOS. Swift is pretty amazing and I’ve learned a ton since my switch. I am certainly a better dev for learning Swift. Two things I miss: JavaScripts flexibility is something I miss. Some of the things people hate about JavaScript are things I miss (dynamic typing, mutable objects). Also I enjoyed the OSS ecosystem. CSS. In iOS I am still not great with constraints/storyboard past the standard use cases. I’ve not been able to find a good resource to get better at them. They are insanely powerful but not well explained. CSS has come a long way and I naturally think in CSS when trying to do iOS layouts, something I’m working to improve.
You still need to set up a frame for your application. Setting up managers to make network calls and store and load data if you’re working with apps that require network calls. I came from web dev too, so much better.
I'm in the same boat. 15 years as a web developer looking into IOS dev. My one question is how does the full time job landscape look? I know it depends on area but for those that have a full time IOS gig was it hard finding that job?
Fuck I hate dynamic typing. Haha I’m currently getting to work in both JS and Swift (more JS) and Swift and it’s static typing is so much nicer to work with. Hell, we use Flow (ughhhh) to try and get some static typing.
Thank you good sir!
Javascript made me run towards ios. Absolutely hate it
I’ve been learning iOS development on the side for the past few years (definitely still learning) and one of the best resources for me was using udemy.com for in depth lessons (when they’re on sale). I want to get back into learning this summer; I’m going to rebuild this [simple app](https://github.com/riconaranjo/LocationsApp) I made over a year ago and play around with it to add new features: - settings page - colour themes - force touch shortcuts - force touch previewing I want to make sure I learn these things well, and the best way I know how to do that is to teach it to other ppl so I want to create a few workshops for September. I already made one last year on the same app (which is outdated now: https://github.com/riconaranjo/iOS-Workshop) Let me know if you need help or want to help contribute somehow, I think it would be cool to work together 🙂
I agree except I would recommend starting with Python since it’s both easier to learn and it’s a very common scripting language used in many work places. You’ll find it much easier to go first Python then C/C++ rather than the other way around – as I had to do.
Super cool. Thank you! I'll keep that in mind! Cheers!
I always disliked the argument of more “choices”, had to switch from Angular 4 to Vue because project lead thinks there’s more “choices”. In the end, it’s just an endless cascade of issues to get everything to work together. There’s nothing wrong wanting to work with official tools and libraries for the basic stuff, and you end up writing your own with the project specific codes anyways.
Python is a very good language too. Any of them will serve you well. I like C simply because it gives you a very good look at the internals of memory management and is very close to the metal in terms of what it compiles down to. Often the resulting machine code is pretty similar to what you do in C. Of course, that can be pretty frustrating at times too because it is so easy to shoot yourself in the foot. C is a very simple language and it's pretty easy to express your intents, especially when you learn a few design patterns. C++ adds a ton of complexity to the mix. It's a great language but a tough one to learn as your first.
Then make an API that asks those types to describe themselves by populating a view passed to it. `is` is usually a code smell. Depending on hard coded types isn't very "object oriented". Instead, make an API that let's the receiver decide what to do (or not).
Js no longer hype driven development. It is a retarded driven development
The part 2 video has the wrong video uploaded.
I'm not aware of any Swift-native implementation (or anything in Foundation). But it looks like there are some 1-file C implementations on GitHub. It would be pretty easy to add one of those to your Swift project and call the C API from your Swift code.
Also, OP, be aware that Swift positions you close to not only iOS but also the Mac. While Cocoa and Cocoa Touch can be quite different and definitely the deeper you go the more differences arise. Often either of then encourages to do some work on the other, recently Apple made some efforts to make iOS apps easier to adapt (or rather extend them into the Mac) so you may benefit from that too in the coming years. Ps. Just don’t fall into pithole of abandoned libraries that you no longer need because the language evolves fast.
I use TypeScript and enjoy it.
Don't stop there! You can use Swift on the server as well! I enjoy Vapor a great deal.
Why is it not another good reason?
I used Quick/Nimble a bit earlier but found it hard to always have something to "describe". I usually have a lot of RxSwift code which I test using RxBlocking/RxTest - which does not rally mix sova well with Quick. Thus I write my own extensions to XCTest and RxBlocking. But it would be nice with a good mocking framework, and Cuckoo seems to be one of the better ones.
I put this into viewdidappear but it doesn't seem to be doing the animating, the slider loads at 100 (max value) when I run it, I'm not quite sure if I miscommunicated something but looking over this code it seems this would just instantly set the value to the max value of the slider which in this case is 100. I'm not familiar with autoreverse and repeat so maybe I'm missing out on the logic here but which part of this is triggering the incremental increase of value to max and then subsequent slider decrease back to min again? Did you mean I have to wrap the animate statement you wrote into a loop that does the incrementing and decrementing? It seems almost too simple for this one animate statement to handle everything. override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) { super.viewDidAppear(animated) UIView.animate( withDuration: 1, delay: 0, options: [.autoreverse, .repeat], animations: { [weak self] in self?.slider.setValue(self?.slider.maximumValue ?? 0, animated: false) }, completion: nil ) } If I try to increment like this it still only does a single instantaneous slider value setting to the max value that the user can't see while slider.value &lt; slider.maximumValue { UIView.animate( withDuration: 1, delay: 0, options: [.autoreverse, .repeat], animations: { [weak self] in self?.slider.setValue((self?.slider.value.rounded())! + 1, animated: false) }, completion: nil ) }
If you hate Pods, you might love Carthage
Cocoapods.org And carthage, well it’s decentralized, so it’s a bit of a problem. But, more and more libs with pods support, add Carthage support as well. Search with pods, use with carthage
Also, Ray is the most credible tutorial for iOS
More money, if he’s good.
You mentioned LAMP
I think it would be fair to assume that if you look at average salaries, an average dev in iOS will still out-earn one in in Web Dev. Obviously that’s not always the case but on average.
Hmm, be dependent on the country. Then again, there are countries where being a dev doesn’t worth much. I’m look at you, Western European countries!
My bad, just read the doc and it seem that you need to set animated: true on slider.setValue. It's an exception in UIKit :/ This is perfectly working: UIView.animate( withDuration: 1, delay: 0, options: [.autoreverse, .repeat], animations: { [weak self] in self?.slider.setValue(self?.slider.maximumValue ?? 0, animated: true) }, completion: nil )
I too have started to study Swift in the past few months. Tho I have some prior experience from uni, I would say that knowledge was much... in depth. :D Currently I'm doing 100 days of Swift by Paul Hudson, 10/10 would recommend it to you. In the beginning he goes through the basics like enums, classes, variables etc. After you do small couple 10 line projects in which he is teaching common pattern and best practices. You can find out everything about it on his website hackingwithswift.com/100
Does it? I think I forgot to upload part two. I'll do so right now
Did you get the link suggestion on YouTube or inside the reddit channel?
I am confused. Can you show me an example? How do you make an API for that? Thanks.
Yup.. currently working through iOS Apprentice and learning a ton. Check out Ray's stuff OP.
Any thoughts on Swift Package Manager? I too am switching over simply because I love swift and I love the quality of iOS apps.
While true I find their tuts and books to be extremely basic.
I too am switching over simply because I love swift and I love the quality of iOS apps and I want to build for hardware and my boss said he would support me and give me iOS bugs to fix.
What do you think about this? [https://pastebin.com/ecsLGUJz](https://pastebin.com/ecsLGUJz)
Better! However, this line is poorly designed: `if detailsData is Student { contactButtonOutlet.isHidden = true }` Your controller is assuming everything is contactable except for students. Don't do that, instead, ask your objects if they're contactable, and them decide.
What else can be improved about that code? Do you any other suggestions? :)
Nice. You're lucky to have a boss like that.
Don't quote me on this but i think Apple are or have already deprecated it. Not supported anymore.
Cloudkit is dreadful
I started learning Swift two years ago, started with iOS, but definitely fell into Vapor. Swift is a beautiful language and Vapor is an amazing framework when you get how does the ORM work and understand the importance of SwiftNIO. I haven't changed my job yet because here in my country the only way to do Swift is in mobile, so the only way I'm applying everything is with a small business I'm running.
Try Raywenderlich website. Has one of the best tutorial series I've found out there.
Hey OP, I was in your situation recently. You could read this whole thread -- or just this: # DO IT &amp;#x200B; ✌️
if you think IDE are a problem, you didn't test Xcode. IMO, it's at eclipse level &amp;#x200B; You'll probably love swift, and hate the tooling especially when you'll want to publish your first app
I have a few gripes with this video. 1) You do quite a few things in the video without explaining them. Examples: - Why did you constrain your scroll view then change the constraints afterwards? - Why are you bringing the page control subview to the front rather than doing it in the storyboard? - Why not use UIPageViewController? - Why create a view and XIB rather than using view controllers? 2) Who is your demographic? It’s clear that the content is for beginners, but I think there are a couple of practices that you are teaching that can be seen as bad habits. It’s easy for other beginners to follow your content without knowing why or how things work. 3) What is the main purpose of the video? Is it to teach someone what they are doing? Again, right now it feels like the video just shows someone how to do something in a cut and paste kind of way without understanding why or how it works.
Because you're generalising every website. It's perfectly possible to make a website without that crap, and trackers also exist in apps. Just not to the same extent.
I saw this ===&gt; https://artsy.github.io/blog/2019/01/05/its-time-to-use-spm/
Thanks all! Just started 100 days of Swift, pretty useful lessons.
I think this is what you are looking for: [https://medium.com/swift-india/android-like-tabs-in-ios-sliding-tabs-segments-4dc38d801463](https://medium.com/swift-india/android-like-tabs-in-ios-sliding-tabs-segments-4dc38d801463)
I do both swift/iOS and Go/Vue and they both have their pros and cons. If I had to choose though i'd go with iOS. # Swift / iOS **Pros** * Single Language / API stack. * One layer instead of two on web (front end, web server) * Static compilation / Code completion. * Integrated Help. * Simulators are great. Almost never have to test on real devices. * The platform is rock solid and don't have to worry about security. * It's hard so pays well and generally filters out bad coders. * Less thrashing of underlying tech than web. i have 9 year old iOS code that's still running well. **Cons** * Im just not crazy about swift. I actually prefer objC and even yes JS. It's clumsy trying to use swift with objC types and apis. * Interface builder sucks. Especially on a laptop using storyboards w/ auto layout * Every new swift release breaks code and changes the language in fundamental ways. Less so as time goes on. * XCode is buggy and getting worse. Constant false flag errors. # Web **Pros** * Reactive UI frameworks make going back to traditional UI coding painful. I know about reactive swift frameworks but the ecosystem just isn't built to work as seamlessly as something like Vue. * Hot code reloading. * Much lower LOC than iOS. JS is very powerful and succinct * Go is probably my favorite language ever. It's the perfect language for building API servers IMO. &amp;#x200B; **Cons** * JS lacking types is double edged sword. refactoring and code completion not great experience but ill take to 5-10x less code over typing. * Lower barrier of entry attracts bad/average programmers. * More work staying on top of the massive ecosystem of the web.
I’m sorry you didn’t like the video, but in development there’s many solutions to the same problem. If you have the sound on, I explain what I’m doing often.
I love JS. Powerful as heck. Try building stuff like Vue / React / Svelte in any other language. IF you like writing lots of boilerplate code to tell the compiler what you want to do than I can understand why you wouldn't like JS.
The web ecosystem has been described as on "giant agile session". You have all kinds of amazing frameworks that are free and open source to work with. Yeh you have to retool a little bit, but the end results are awesome IMO. I'm an iOS dev mostly but really enjoyed learning go/js/vue
I've never tried it, but can't you just return false in the shouldInteractWithURL delegate method and do your stuff there?
Hmm... But wouldn't that make the whole UITextView unable to open URLs? (Forgot to mention that I already have some links in the same text view) &amp;#x200B; I'll definitely look into it, though. Thanks a lot for your response!!! 👍🏻😎
Ah, then yes, it would. But if you know the approved URLs ahead of time, you could return true if it matches, or false if it doesn’t.
I did and am glad for it. Gives you very different perspective on how to build things. Particularly the reactive stuff.
I am down to join your group. What are you using for communication?
This is a very good breakdown, thank you for this.
That’s not really a reply to anything I said. I watched the video *with the sound on*, thanks for explaining how videos work. I’m trying to give you constructive criticism here. Yes of course there are many ways to do things. My issue is you don’t explain why you chose your way. So anybody watching the video is just supposed to assume this is the way to do things without any questions?
I did things this way because it worked for me for what I needed for a personal project. Judging from your negative comments on other subs, I don’t feel the need to engage with you.
Hey! I wrote an answer about this on SO, check it out: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36198299/uitextview-disable-selection-allow-links/53171516#53171516
Just released my posture-correction app, [Proneckt](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/proneckt/id1435390909?mt=8) yesterday! It's the first and only app I've ever made, so feedback would be greatly appreciated. Essentially, you do an initial calibration to let the app recognize the bad posture habits you'd like to correct for yourself. Then, you just let it run in the background and it'll send you a notification whenever it detects your bad posture!
Is this iOS or macOS? Sounds like when they rewrote PDFKit for macOS 10.12 they regressed a significant portion of functionality (https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/60440) Unfortunately looking at the spec free drawing annotations don’t seem to be well defined (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/pdfkit/pdfannotationsubtype#declarations) The closest I can google out is this that claims to support Pen annotations (https://github.com/uxmstudio/UXMPDFKit/blob/master/README.md) but I’m not certain it does what you need.
If you are using UITextView, you can add a tap gesture recognizer and determine where in the string it was located via [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/nslayoutmanager/1403028-characterindex](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/nslayoutmanager/1403028-characterindex) Grab the NSLayoutManager via [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextview/1618602-layoutmanager](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextview/1618602-layoutmanager) &amp;#x200B; If you wanted to make it more generic and flexible, you could add your own custom attributes to the attributed string, and retrieve the attributes at the given character index via [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsattributedstring/1410494-attributes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsattributedstring/1410494-attributes) &amp;#x200B; Hope that helps!
The publishing is not that bad now. The people who do the reviews can be a drag, but for a while, Xcode was failing uploads consistently but they fixed that. When you compare the amount of grief you have to go through to get a release done in ios vs. web apps and/or java apps, it's pretty astounding. We have gotten closest to real Continuous Delivery on ios projects, where we just push releases for a single ticket if we want, cause it's so little trouble. &amp;#x200B; TestFlight has gone nowhere, but it is pretty easy to get builds out to testers.
A few thoughts. Much of this is opinion and others might give you differing advice. You have your protocol called `Person`, but it's really tied to your UI. I would called it `DisplayablePerson` or similar. You might consider it to be more of View Model. The four functions in `Person` would be better suited as vars with getters, e.g. `var shortInfoString: NSMutableAttributedString? { get }` Your code doesn't mutate the info strings after retrieving them. I would have the functions (or getters, if you take my previous advice) return NSAttributedString. Since the fields in `Person` aren't a core part of your data model (it's part of the UI!), I would conform to this protocol via an extension.
Not sure what you mean with negative and gaslighting since I regularly get up voted on my comments, but sure go ahead and reject criticisms based on a posters previous comments. Look I’m sorry if I hurt your feelings, I didn’t mean to do that, I don’t think I was negative in my comment to this post, I assume people are open to criticism and feedback like I am. Being open to feedback and accepting it is a great way to get ahead in your projects and career.
 switch currentMonth { case 12, 1, 2: currentSeasonRow = 0 case 3, 4, 5: currentSeasonRow = 1 case 6, 7, 8: currentSeasonRow = 2 case 9, 10, 11: currentSeasonRow = 3 default: currentSeasonRow = 0 } Switch cases don't check for booleans - they do pattern matching. This is why you can switch on most things like ints, enums, strings, etc
you need a reference from your main view which holds the container view to the child view. when the child view is added to the container view you need to calculate the height of the child view and call a method on the main view to update the height constraint of the childviewcontainer.
Ints are also not legal arguments to the || operator, which is the actual cause of the specific compiler error the OP is getting. Unlike C, Swift doesn't automatically convert numbers and pointers to booleans.
You right. Good point!
Yes of course this makes perfect sense. I've been staring at a screen for too long today and simple things aren't making sense. Thanks for the quick and concise response.
In that delegate method you can check which url they are tapping and act accordingly.
In addition to what /u/audiodsp mentioned, which is great advice: 1. You keep track of both the `school` and `schoolId` in both your `Student` and `Teacher` classes, when I'm thinking you can probably get one from the other. 2. Similarly, there are some shared properties between `Student` and `Teacher` that you could refactor. When refactoring state or behavior in OOP, your two options are *delegation/composition*, or *inheritance*. Inheritance would look like a `SchoolMember` class which contains this properties, and `Student` and `Teacher` both extend, and inherit from. Composition would look like pulling those properties (`schoolId`, etc.) into a `SchoolAffiliation` class, which `Student` and `Teacher` could each contain a _reference_ to. 3. It's common to want to fit properties into primitives (like `grade`), but I'd argue that an enumeration or String would be a better fit here. What about kindergarten? Or preschool? You could argue those get "special" numbers like `0` or `13` but then you have to keep track of them, and it might be easier to just have `Grade.kindergarten` as an enumeration, or `"P", "K", "1", "2"` as Strings, to give yourself some flexibility. 4. Rather than make classes tell you via a `boolean`-returning method that they're _contactable_, why not just make a `Contactable` protocol and have your `Teacher` class implement it? Then that protocol could require (as an example) implementation of `getWorkPhone()` and `getHomePhone()` which return `String?`, and then could provide a default method implementation `getBestPhone()` which iterates the known methods and figures out which (if any) are populated. You're off to a good start - and designing these kinds of models is always a struggle between being direct (with the potential for duplication), or being polymorphic (with the potential for confusion/redirection), and finding the right balance between the two.
I like her course but I think Apple's Everyone Can Code App Development with Swift book may be better for someone with previous experience or the [letsbuildthatapp.com](https://letsbuildthatapp.com) guy. He builds out an Instagram Clone in straight code and walks you through it. To me this has been the most helpful thing so far because it's a crud app with a firebase backend.
The web does attract non programmers. It was designed that way. It is first and foremost a document sharing tool not an application creation tool.
I have to agree that Xcode does have some drawbacks when you've been spoiled by VSCode.
I can join you. I've been studying iOS dev off and on since Swift arrived. Right now I'm doing the Instagram tutorial by letsbuildthatapp... I wanted to build out a crud app with Firebase as a first step as I have experience with that on the web.
Thank you for your great suggestions. Can you please explain your last sentence?
JavaScript, Swift and Go and don't look back.
&gt; it can only make straight lines, boxes, and interactive elements PDFKit does work with UIBezierPath which allows for complex shapes. What exactly would you like to draw that it can't handle?
I think iOS could actually benefit from something like an iOS version of CSS.
Thank you for your suggestions!
.
Is crahlytics going away? Do you have a link to info with that?
Switched to Sentry about a month ago. Happy about it so far. Easy to setup and use.
I am trying to create a note taking app that works with the apple pencil so it will need to do handwriting and all those type of things. I just don't know what is the best way to achieve this with a pdf since I want to maintain vector data when they zoom in on their notes. I have looked and I have found pdfkit which is what I am currently using to view the pdfs. Then I also found core graphics and CG has CGPDFDocument so I am just completely unsure how to accomplish what I want it to do. If you still don't understand what I mean then if you go onto youtube to watch a goodnotes 5 review, that should hopefully convey what I am trying to achieve better.
Google's deprecating Fabric, Firebase is the new home to Crashlytics. You're good, everyone on Fabric will have to go through the migration.
HockeyApp has been decent, it’s now rolled into Azure I think / is in the process of that
This is for iOS. Essentially trying to recreate goodnotes at a basic functionality. Oh cool never found the annotation subtype documentation. I have recently discovered CGPDFDocument but sadly no good documentation (besides apple basic info) or use cases for it exists. But since it supports core graphics it might be what I need? Thanks I'll take a look at that pen annotation on github
Okay, so it’s only half click bait 😆
Do you use this with production apps?
Thanks! :-)
Yeah, about that… https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/17/microsoft-to-shut-down-hockeyapp/
I just implement crashlytics like a month ago and I was gonna be upset if it was gone lol
,
They’re migrating it into “visual studio app centre” https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/hockeyapp/ We already use azure for some things so it makes sense
I understand. I wrote my first line of code this year.
I didn’t know that was part of Azure. I’m used to all the Azure stuff having Azure branding.
Hah yep. In a few months they’re fully deprecating hockey and it will all be azure though
Yeah I didn't know crashlytics was going away neither.
Yeah I use Fabric already
So you will need it to run in the background while you type ?
Yes
Look up using background services iOS along with writing functionality for keyboard in Swift. Also it’s best you have a Mac to install Xcode or use a VM
If I learn how to do it for iOS will it be the same for Mac?
I’m sorry you want to build a desktop app for Mac OS not iOS. It will be different Mac OS is not exactly the same as iOS
Ok I will google the why you told me to with macOS instead of iOS thank you
I recommend crashlytics. We moved from crashlytics to crashlytics and it’s been fine.
Neither. You can just have a free function without needing either of them. What are you trying to do? If you explain it then we might be better able to help.
My company is moving to bugsnag. Way more useful anyways. We can provide better context for crashes by providing current app state. So for instance we can pass oir config values we use for ab testing. This means if a test looks like it failed we can rule out crashes as the reason.
Isn't firebase pretty heavy? Can you install only the crash reporter?
What does this even mean? Which would you rather use for a sentence: a noun, or a verb?
Why would functions return NSMutableAttributedString? Mutability isn't an attribute that callers appear to care about, nor should they. Also, you should run your code through a spell checker.
Enum with no cases, that way it can't be instantiated I respectfully disagree with the dude that said free functions, I prefer to have the context of some grouping
I think he means for (mostly) pure functions
You can build basically anything with JavaScript, Python, Swift, and Rust. JS and Python will be easy to find work with.
You could replace the call to moveRow with a deleteRows and insertRows call
 When I try that I'm getting this error? **Invalid update: invalid number of rows in section 0.** **The number of rows contained in an existing section after the update (3) must be equal to the number of rows contained in that section before the update (3), plus or minus the number of rows inserted or deleted from that section (0 inserted, 1 deleted) and plus or minus the number of rows moved into or out of that section (0 moved in, 0 moved out).**
Seriously?
Congrats!!! 🎉 The key is to be persistent even when its extremely extremely difficult. Things wont happen overnight or even in a year.
Thanks. I've already learned so much
Hope this helps: switch currentMonth { case 12, 1, 2: currentSeasonRow = 0 case 3, 4, 5: currentSeasonRow = 1 case 6, 7, 8: currentSeasonRow = 2 case 9, 10, 11: currentSeasonRow = 3 default: currentSeasonRow = 0 }
Are you calling tableView beginUpdates and endUpdates before and after your row insert/delete/update/move calls?
Although using enum to avoid writing init is clever, it can be misleading to those unfamiliar with using enum in such a non-standard way. I personally prefer `class` because the “grouping” in this scenario should not be interpreted as a “value” and I find that matching the type to the component’s role usually more accurately conveys the context and expectations as to how things should be used. In other words, if we will never instantiate the thing, then we shouldn’t imply it by specifying it as a value type.
Great work! This looks really useful, and implementing 3D snapshots is especially impressive. Are there specific steps to only link the framework for debug builds of an app? It might be helpful to include an example that shows how to use this when debugging, but exclude it from release builds.
You e implemented move and update wrong, in the apple docs itself it tells you that on update you should just manually configure the row at index path and move you should manually configure night the old and new indexpaths
Nope, you need to install Firebase core package at least, so you also have analytics etc. Rest of their features are more modularized.
🙅🏼‍♂️
I’ll be checking them out, thnx
You can specify certain cocoapods to only be included in debug builds.
Looks nice, I currently use FLEX to debug views, this looks nice too though. FLEX can intercept network calls and logs too.
Thanks a lot for your response, I'll look into it! 😎👍🏻
Thanks a lot for your response, that's a ton of info! I'll look into it! 😎👍🏻
What should it return? And why should I use spell checker? Thanks.
Okay, what do you mean by manually configure both cells?
Yep, fixed it now. I think that was the problem. Thanks heaps!
So you make 2 extra methods for configureing cells as below and use those where approriate, like in the update/move. func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -&gt; UITableViewCell { let cell: MyCell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: String(describing: MyCell.self), for: indexPath) as! MyCell configureCell(cell: cell, indexPath: indexPath) return cell } private func configureCell(indexPath: IndexPath) { if let cell = tableView.cellForRow(at: indexPath) as? MyCell { configureCell(cell: cell, indexPath: indexPath) } } private func configureCell(cell: MyCell, indexPath: IndexPath) { // Get data from datasource and configure the cell cell.configure(title: title, subtitle: subtitle, selected: selected) } }
Google purchased Fabric a while back. Fabric is to be shut down in June. You will need to switch something else. While Firebase is an option, if you just need crashlytics, better solutions are available.
Or switch to a different solution. Depends on the needs
Post saved.
It’s heaps too long so i just scanned it but it seems that you simplify functional programming to just writing stateless (what you call pure) functions. Imo that one is a no brainer in OOP, too...
Best one Ive found https://www.udemy.com/share/100YzIB0Edd1tSRnQ=/
Why complicate things with switching? Use the fact that you know there are only 12 months and 4 seasons, and use simple division and modulo operation, like this: \`\`\` Season(rawValue: ((month.rawValue + 1 ) / (Month.count / Season.count)) % Season.count) \`\`\` Find the whole [solution in this gist](https://gist.github.com/Sajjon/e7e8b6ca5a2281d3bf2daf1f86883d9f):
Apple provides crash reports for free. They are even integrated directly into Xcode
Good job! Sorry to piggyback of this post but it is semi related: can anyone recommend a similar 3rd party lib that you can see an in app console logger in real time?
Yes I knew this, but Crashlytics is not going away like the title says. What better solutions are out there?
Read it instead of scanning it, you missed quite a bit. The article Dows a pretty decent job of laying out just what functional programming means and how to approach it in a language that has a mix of functional and imperative concepts. Pure functions are just one thing that are mentioned and are the primary focus of the article because they are low-hanging fruit and easy to accomplish in many languages.
Just started learning Swift a month ago and totally down for this!
How about a plain NSAttributedString? And, so you don't make bloopers like "funtion".
When I use the group of static functions with no cases, properties and init then I'd like to choose the right types. &amp;#x200B; The struct, enum, and classes can have static functions. Someone prefers to use an enum. Others prefer to use struct or class. But I didn't get the right answer why did apply for the static function. &amp;#x200B; I think enum without cases is not suitable, but I saw them a lot of developers used an enum for static function.
Thank you \~! I agree with you.
Thank you \~!
The reason `enum` works best is you can't instantiate an `enum` without any cases. So if you are just trying to namespace a bunch of functions and such then using a caseless `enum` is a good thing. If you use `struct` or `class` then you may need to block instantiation somehow, resulting in extra code that really does nothing but adds clutter. If you're just doing some free functions then you don't need to namespace them all. You can just have a few free functions at the root level.
Then make a note of it in the comment before the `enum`. It's pretty obvious that when you have a caseless `enum` it's not meant to be instantiated. A `struct` or `class` really doesn't directly convey the concept of namespace either, they are all just keywords. Using caseless `enum` is a very common convention in Swift. Most programmers will recognize that it's being used for namespacing right off the bat.
The module itself is a grouping. If you are only using one or two free functions then adding another level of namespacing can just introduce clutter, especially at call sites. Once you start to progress into a bunch of free functions then some organization might be a good thing. That's where a finer-grained namespacing really shines.
Fixed both of them. Thank you.
Build your own
Stack Overflow... But you need a guide to use that too.
Yes but I should learn which files to use and where, how to use the interface, it’s not done just by “asking on stack overflow”
Did you buy it? You suggest it?
What are you using to learn vapor?
&gt; Where should I instantiate/load my XIB? Read the documentation in the header for ViewController. It's loaded automatically if there is no view in the storyboard scene.
Yes. Yes.
Pretty sure you just compile and sign it yourself in x ode with your account’s signing cert
When I started out I got the answers to those questions on SO. But I think I know what you mean. Here’s a good place to help get you rounded out, YouTube: Sean Allen.
I mean, if I don’t how how to put a tab, okay, I can ask. But I’ve never used xcode, I don’t even knwo where to start ahahah Thanks for the youtube channel btw
The point of a static function is that it relates to the data type it's contained within. Why would you create an empty, useless data type for this? What's the use case?
&gt; stateless (what you call pure) functions [Pure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) is a stronger qualification than merely "stateless".
So you like Swift, but you don't like frameworks that use the features of Swift? Could you save us time and just tell us which features of Swift you think a framework ought to use?
&gt; I am designing my custom class to be @IBDesignable so I can see it on my UIViewController and render real time but out of no reason some times I get an error saying that it couldn't be rendered. Yes, that's pretty much how @IBDesignable goes.
Question: What exactly are you trying to learn in Xcode? Xcode is quite simple since it's just an application. Having said that, I see Xcode as a container of more complex features. For example: Storyboards are in Xcode but I wouldn't really look to a book on Xcode to learn how to navigate storyboards. I'd look to a book on autolayout for that. Same with build settings. Build settings are part of Xcode but I wouldn't look to an Xcode book to teach me the build process
Swift namespacing is pretty much limited to the module level but you can provide additional namespacing by nesting types and functions inside other scopes. One such use is an outer `enum`, `struct`, or `class`. An `enum` is particularly suited to this since if it has no `case` then it can't be instantiated and pretty much has no use other than providing a namespace.
Maybe post a sample project, so we can give advice on how to organize your code better?
Really?? I'm surprised to hear the news about Perfect. They've been on my mental back burner. That's a bummer. From what I'm seeing though, you've already looked into the only 3 contenders around.
I d'ont understand how making a release can be easier on IOS Vs the web. I can update my reacts web apps with a command line, and have it online 2 minutes later. On Ios the build, signing and upload take at least an hour, then I have to wait for 30 minute to an hour for the build to be ready , fill in some field, click, and wait from 12 to 48 hours for review. &amp;#x200B; Each of these step can fail, without much information or justification. &amp;#x200B; I admit that, at least, xcode does not fail upload as much as it was last year.
I agree with you about Vapor. I really want to like it but just can't. I may just write my own using NIO but I'm not sure that's the right solution either.
&gt; Pure functions OK. What makes it "pure"??
The [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function), no scare quotes necessary: &gt; a pure function is a function that has the following properties: &gt; &gt; 1. Its return value is the same for the same arguments (no variation with local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or input streams from I/O devices). 1. Its evaluation has no side effects (no mutation of local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or I/O streams).
You can change the colors as you want, you don't have to use a preset.
Good luck! Hopefully your next employer will utilize your talents. 🙂
press `cmd` + `,` for preferences you can’t find it in the preferences
Not much that I can tell. I'm not a fan of \`contactButtonOutlet\`. It being an outlet is largely irrelevant for all code except the defining line, where you can see the \`@IBOutlet\` anyway. I would just call it \`contactButton\`. I'm also suspicious of the optionality of the models' fields. What does it mean for a teacher to have a \`nil\` \`id\`, \`name\`, \`class\`, \`imageURL\`, \`description\` and \`school\`? Such an instance should be disallowed. Also, \`imageURL\` should be a \`URL\`, not a \`String\`.
OK, so why? What is the significance of this? Why does this matter?
 [https://github.com/stealthanthrax/xcode-Night-Owl](https://github.com/stealthanthrax/xcode-Night-Owl) although I personally use [https://github.com/bojan/xcode-one-dark](https://github.com/bojan/xcode-one-dark)
Be that as it may, i was just saying that anyone who coded anything multi-threaded in imperative world know to keep no state in the methods and guarantee the same return.
Mainly, imagine you want to write a .Sum() method for an array. So you have a Calculus class and declare your func Sum&lt;T&gt;(array: [T], kp: ReferenceWritableKeyPath&lt;T, Int&gt;) -&gt; Int64 If you implement that as a simple for loop var result: Int64 = 0 for el in array { result += el[keyPath: kp] } return result } Then you can call this method on the same instance of Calculus class from any thread. But say you did it like so: class Calculus { var result: Int64 = 0 func Sum&lt;T&gt;(array: [T], kp: ReferenceWritableKeyPath&lt;T, Int&gt;) -&gt; Int64 { for el in array { self.result += el[keyPath: kp] } return self.result } Now if you use the same instance of Calculus across threads, the code will be screwed, because we are using a property. Again, IMO the above is why everyone in ‘imperative’ paradigm know not to write the second example I’ve given.
You don't have to get a review for internal testing, but the fact that you need one for 'external testers' can be annoying since you don't want actual Testers (non-dev) as internal. Yeah I am just saying the history of build is that the build is sufficiently complex that it fails some of the time. I find that the build almost NEVER fails on Xcode. As a matter of fact these days the only times it fails is if we have a problem with Carthage. Recently this calendar component we were using was crashing building tvOS. So I had to remember to do --platform on the update command. That sucked. Carthage does not feel like a forward-facing vision of build. For instance, Amazon is not putting out binaries that work with Xcode 10 yet, so it drops back and builds all their crap from source (which takes a long time). But then if the calendar component fails, rerunning with the platform switch results in the aws stuff being rebuilt again. Yes there are web builds that are super reliable and fast. But those are less common.
Thanks!
Well, night owl isn’t included with the default themes.
Okay, I’ll start since no one else seems to be inclined to. First of all, you’re probably displaying images on the view, not on the view controller. It’s common to use a view controller to add and remove items (including other views) from a view. I don’t know that you have to do anything special to make sure that one of your views doesn’t change. What would change it, if not code in your own view controller? Add your image once, and never implement code that removes or updates it.

I don't know what your point is. Imperative programmers stumbled onto a sloppy approximation of functional programming, decades after functional programmers laid out the plans for it? That is precisely why it's important for articles like this to exist: so people can understand that "pure" is not (only) "stateless", and "keep no state in the methods" has a purpose beyond multi-threading. There is actually an entire field of computer science beyond computers, and it has vocabulary and theorems and the whole nine yards. Besides, if "anyone who coded anything" really followed this advice, when not required to by their programming language, I could have saved a couple decades of dealing with threading bugs. Can you name one program you use which follows this advice that you say is so common? Your web browser is multi-threaded. Are all of its functions pure? Or were all of them written by people who don't know anything about programming?
Gee, if only someone could have written an article on this subject!

Try formatting your code with reddit’s code formatter or use pastebin so we can see indentions and understand what you currently have
Why do you need a counter?
Just do it on paper with small numbers. And then use the debugger to compare what the code does to what you did.
I’m not on my computer right know, but I spot two issues: - You aren’t using the “base” Parameter in your function. In the for loop, you are creating a new base which will increase in every loop (0,1,2,...,exponent) - Counter and result will be reset every time a new for loop starts. You should define them before the for loop starts One enhancement that could be done: - why aren’t you using a simple “return result” instead of break to return the value of the calculation?
There's a lot of wrong here, but I'll try to guide you. First put those variables outside of for loop, because now, they only exist in one loop. When another loop is going, the variables that you created are no longer there and new ones are created again with values 0. For base in 0...exponent - the name "base" is wrong here, because you're iterating through exponents not base, so I would named it something like currentExponent You don't need counter since "base" (currentExponent) is doing exactly that. You don't need if condition because once it ends, it's gonna break anyway. result = base \* base... this is also wrong, it won't return the correct result after few loops, so I'll let you figure this one out
I think you may be overcomplicating this. If you think of exponentiation as being a process of repeated multiplication, then that's your loop. How many times do you need to loop? When you figure that out, half of the code is written already. The next step is to figure out what operation you actually need to perform in the loop. What is your starting value for the result, and in what way do you need to change that value each time the loop executes? Remember that your result needs to be declared outside of the loop - otherwise, one of the steps that will be performed _every time_ the loop runs will be to "declare a new value `result` with an initial value", and you only want to do that once, outside of the loop. My last piece of guidance would be that if you set the bounds of the loop correctly, you don't need a counter, an `if` condition, or a `break`. Solve the question in the order of steps I've laid out here and you won't even have to think about using those!
First off all: thank you for helping and the tips above. so I rethink now everything and I think I am on a better wy now then we before. This is my actual code, I commented my thoughts behind the lines. But I still don't get the correct result, I think its just a small thinking error. could you please look at it and tell me your thoughts? \##################################################################### **var** result = 0 *// the Result* **var** currentBase = 0 *// the Current base (so when entering 2 its set to 2 and after running the first loop its 4* **func** pow(base: Int, exponent: Int) -&gt; Int { currentBase = base *// when entering a 2 the current base is set to 2* **for** **\_** **in** 1...exponent{ *// My thought here is that when you enter 3 as the exponent the loop is running 3 Times* result = currentBase \* base *// the result will be 4 (2\*2) and when the loop runs the second time it will be 8 (4\*2) and at the third time it will be 8 (4\*2)* currentBase = result *// the current base will be increased from 2 to 4 (2\*2)* } **return** result *// returning 8 expected* } \##################################################################
You're definitely heading in the right direction! You're still overcomplicating, though, and you've moved some things into variables that are outside your function, which isn't necessary and is considered bad design. Let me give you a few more pointers. Start by moving `result` and `currentBase` inside the function. func pow(base: Int, exponent: Int) -&gt; Int { var result = 0 var currentBase = base for _ in 1...exponent { result = currentBase * base currentBase = result } return result } What is your reasoning behind having both `currentBase` and `result`? Take a look at the way you're modifying them: you multiply `currentBase` by `base` and set that into `result`, and then set the value of `result` into `currentBase`. That means that by the end of the body of the `for` loop, both of them have the same value, so you don't need both! Just use `result`. That simplifies it to: func pow(base: Int, exponent: Int) -&gt; Int { var result = base for _ in 1...exponent { result = result * base } return result } That's already much cleaner and easier to work with. There _is_ still a minor problem with this code that will mean the result isn't what you expect, but I think you'll find it much easier to find the problem in this version than in the more complicated one. Don't introduce any new variables :)

To power a given number with given exponent without using pow function. Otherwise that would not help learning for loop
Awesome! Thank you very much Sir! I got the Answer now.... wow so easy ;) I just had to change the for head to 2...exponent. Why? because I can skip the the first loop because I already took the base\*base. &amp;#x200B; Here is the corrected Code: &amp;#x200B; `func pow(base: Int, exponent: Int) -&gt; Int {` `var result = base` `for _ in 2...exponent {` `result = result * base` `}` `return result` `}`
You're very welcome, and you're right, this is a solution! The only thing I would say about this, though, is that if your function is called with `exponent: 1`, you'll get a runtime error, because you'd be trying to iterate over the range `2...1`, which isn't valid. So instead you can initialise `var result = 1` and loop over `1...exponent`, which will give you the expected result. As a bonus, here's a totally different way of solving the problem, which makes use of some advanced stuff: func pow(base: Int, exponent: Int) { return (1...exponent).reduce(1) { $0 * base } } (I'm on mobile right now, so hopefully this doesn't contain a typo!)
Ok thank you! I might wanna wait with the advanced stuff till I reach it with my learning plan. Still learning the Syntax and the possibilities. But stuff like this is great to get some good feelings that the language is somewhat easy.
Of course! I definitely wasn't suggesting that you should use that version instead; just trying to give you a little taste of the possibilities :)
Is the loop index somehow insufficient?
Yes it is. 2 exponent 5 equal 32 Same as 2 *2*2*2*2 So a for loop can do the same as pow(2,5)
Can you stop spamming this please?

Well, look at your post history. Looks quite spammy, right? I get that you don’t spam in one single subreddit, but you’ve posted one of your articles in 10-11 different. For redditors subscribed to many subreddits this will result in a sense of spam.
Yeah I agree with you but according to subreddit rules probably it’s not a spam. Moreover, there are many redditors who doesn’t subscribe to many subreddits for them it could be useful.
No it’s just spam... you don’t contribute to the sub, so don’t spam it...
I think when we share what we have learnt is contribution to sub Reddit. If you have better option please let me know I will take care next time.
What I’m saying is, you only use subreddits to spam it’s not like you use them and want to contribute
My intention is not to spam subreddit that’s why I always post according to sub Reddit rules. Still if you feel I am spamming. I apologise for inconvenience. Please give your feedback how can I improve ? I will be thankful to you.
Without having worked with MapKit before, I would say you need to first get the user’s CLLocation to identify where to place the center of the map. There should be a function or property on the MapKit protocol that you can use to center the map on the location.
Beside handling location permissions, the gist would be: use the location manager to listen for location updates, the mapView has a property to set the location, it will automatically center on it, when you are happy with the location you stop listening.
`func showUser() {` `let region = MKCoordinateRegionMakeWithDistance(mapView.userLocation.coordinate, 1000, 1000)` `mapView.setRegion(mapView.regionThatFits(region), animated: true)` `}`
It’s even easier by just setting the tracking mode on the MapView: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/mkmapview/1616205-setusertrackingmode
Today I learned... Thanks!
Recommendation for advance tuts?
This guy 100% has nasal polyps
Great. I like the fact fact that you use only Apple framework.
Thanks, that was a major goal and honestly it's just so much easier in a way. Rather than trying to find X framework to do Y job then learning how to use it properly (and figuring out its shortcomings), I just figure out how to do whatever it is I'm trying to do natively. I still don't much like WatchKit though, lol. It's probably just the simulators that are causing the most trouble but it's fairly frustrating. My old gen0 watch is a paperweight now so I can't test anything live atm.
I dont have a recommendation. I just feel the tuts on RW can be too basic. That is all I was saying.
I’m actually just starting a course today, to start learning Swift! I know it’s going to be a challenge but I’m looking forward to it!
Solid advice. This will be the next anniversary gift for sure.
Set an NSAttributedString in the textView and add attributes to it. When to add / remove attributes depends on your needs.
https://github.com/cjwirth/RichEditorView/blob/master/README.md
Does this use HTML and just UIView though? I want something that I can just create on top of UITextView...
How do I connect a function to this though? In regards to selecting text, clicking the button, then styling the text? I am trying to allow the user to dynamically change styles when they want and not set a few different styles on static text...
When clicking the button, you can get the current selected range and apply the style to that range. https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextview/1618615-selectedrange#declarations
It’s just NSAttributedString, NSRange and a lot of painstaking logic. I implemented a simple version of this once and it’s a lot more work than you’d think.
Haha, lol. Seems like it’s going to be. I’m new to all this so just trying to get my head around doing this!
Okay, so all it is is getting the range then putting the style on it. Are there methods already made for the generic styles like bold etc. ? I can’t seem to find any documentation around this... thank you for your help.
Here are all the built-in styles: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsattributedstring/key You can set those styles with this function: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsmutableattributedstring/1412179-setattributes
Okay thankyou. Is there a way to set the UITextView to start writing in a different style? Example: If no text is selected change writing style to bold then change to normal when the button is retapped.
Yes, you can add a delegate method to respond whenever the text is changed. https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextviewdelegate/1618599-textviewdidchange Any new text added can then be made bold. When text is selected and you press the button, check what attributes are already present and 'invert' them (From bold to normal and vice versa). I'd suggest you read / Google the Apple documentation more because this can all be found pretty easily.
Assuming you’ll store the rich text somewhere, the easiest way from my experience is using markdown. There’s plenty of different parsers out there that either hook directly into text views, or just provide the parsing from MD-&gt;NSAttributedString. That way you’ll only have to insert the md tags with your rich input buttons instead of managing everything yourself.
[This is the one I used last time](https://github.com/SimonFairbairn/SwiftyMarkdown), works fine. To achieve efficient rich markdown-backed text editing, I'd use an UITextView that accepts user input instantly as undecorated text, then passes it to the md parser when the user has stopped typing (on a background queue if you have a long text). For things like the bold button, find the range of the current word and append \`\*\*\` before and after it. [https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax)
[https://cocoacasts.com/namespaces-in-swift](https://cocoacasts.com/namespaces-in-swift) It's a good article.
&gt; Why complicate things with switching? You’re confusing “clever” with “less complicated”.
Container View's seems kind of overkill for what you're trying to accomplish. I would just drag in a MapView and a UIView. Give them proper constraints but give an outlet to the UIView's height constraint in your view controller to which you can change the height of programmatically however you want. You could create a draggable view that is like 10 pixels in height and full width of the screen that's pinned to the top edge of the lower UIView, then when that draggable view is dragged, use it's Y position to update the height constraint of the lower UIView.
I am using the Google SDK for the map in a view container at the top m. I would like to change views dynamically in the container under the map to change with PageViewController or an other view
I dont agree, when I started out coding some 11 years ago I would not have seen the solution I suggested directly either. Finding these solution is a combination of experience, curiousity, stubborness and intelligence. It is not always the case that intelligence is the bottleneck. In my experience, striving to improve yourself - being stubborn, patient and curious is more often what some developers lack - rather than lack of intelligence.
Off the top of my head: I would do this by first placing a full screen background image. Then when switching images, add the new uiimageview using view.insertSubview(0, img), pin the bottom of view to the top of the other using anchors. From there, you will have to learn about View.animate. Honestly, that animation doesn't look too hard to pull off.
Great question! This would be useful for a project I am working on.
I mean if you really wanted to clean up the code, I’d also suggest redefining the first enum from 0 to 1. That way you don’t have to add 1 every time.
Most likely a Collection View with a custom Layout. The layout would specify each attribute to occupy the full size of the container, and on scroll, displace the top-most one (deduced by the current offset) and leave the other ones static.
A quick search on stack overflow would reveal an answer to that question. Try “add custom controls to AVPlayer in swift”
Thanks!
What exactly is Mood.IsGreatful ? ... is that like an enum or is it something different
It would be an enum, yes.
Possible, yes. In order to “Just Work” you would have to ship the app with a pre-seeded ai model, or have a pre-trained model on a server and upload each image to the cloud for processing. Both of those are non trivial, but they’re both very cool. If you’ve got the time and commitment go for it.
Not with CoreML on iOS. (At least not on device, you can use CreateML on a Mac server and then send the model back to the user) [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/createml](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/createml) [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/core\_ml\_api/downloading\_and\_compiling\_a\_model\_on\_the\_user\_s\_device](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/core_ml_api/downloading_and_compiling_a_model_on_the_user_s_device)
Hi All. Just doing a bit of basic fiddling. Can someone explain why this doesn't work in Swift 5? **var** nums = \[1,25,58,12,36\] **var** counter = nums.count(where: { $0 &lt; 10 }) &amp;#x200B; Just gives me the error : Cannot invoke 'count' with an argument list of type '(where: (Int) -&gt; Bool)' &amp;#x200B; Cheers
Yes, I know what exponentiation is. You ignored my question. Why can't you use the loop index?
Check out this new framework! Sounds like it will do exactly what you’re looking for. Their example image classifier recognizes Poison Ivy, for example. https://skafos.ai
The data visualization is garbage, and only gives you a two week window.
This isn’t swift related at all. You should spend some time in data structures and modeling. For your question: Create a class or struct with an image and sound as properties.
The thing about coding or anything you create in general is that there are numerous ways of doing things. It becomes how you prefer and what you need done. To answer your question you can keep it simple with the one array and make sure the title of the sound and title of the image are exactly the same so when they select the image the titles have to match. It depends exactly what you are trying to accomplish and how complex things will be later though.
(Unless modern web dev has changed or I’m wrong) font-size is not a global styling if I understand what you are doing. Usually in modern web development there are css styles that are applied via specific style tags and can be overridden. You may want to post your html code for us to look at.
I forgot this tag : **&lt;meta** name**=**"viewport" content**=**"initial-scale=1.0" **/&gt;**
FindMyiPhone
I meant more in terms of a stand alone app. Like a library for GPS location or something like that.
CoreLocation
The only application I can think of this is to hack iPhones in the area and no, there's no tool for that, at least not available to the public, if it was your own iPhone and you were sending your lat/long to the cloud and reading it from another app, maybe.
If you're asking the question you're probably not very skilled in swift, use the model you currently have and adapt it accordingly to the new API, it shouldn't be too hard.
Im not that god in swift, I know that. Im a web developer and I took a iOS class thinking it would be fun, but it is out of my scope of skill
Yes you should start from scratch... Kinda. I would use the code you have as a template to an extent but you should rewrite the code so it only includes ONLY what is needed. rewriting the code will also help you remember it.
This is the right answer! Furthermore, Swift gives these “default implementations” (official term) the lowest priority, so they can be overriden by subclasses, class extensions, or static implementation (including with struct and enum). As others have mentioned, the `@optional` implies the `@objc` annotation, which only works on classes that conform to the NSObject protocol. Optional methods vs default implementations mean very different things, but they both can solve this particular situation just fine. I most always use the default implementation approach, as I try to write pure swift most of the time, however, I very occasionally use the optional annotation if the particular component is already bound to the obj-c runtime as primary citizen. Depends on the context I suppose.
The _reason_, (since you asked why), is because Obj-C uses dynamic dispatch exclusively, whereas Swift uses static dispatch. Static requires the function to exist when the code is compiled, whereas dynamic dispatch uses runtime linking. Furthermore, the optional annotation in Obj-C is really there to tell the developer that they need to check if the class implements the method before trying to call it, otherwise they might get a runtime exception. Obj-C gets this from Smalltalk, and as for compiled languages are concerned, I believe they are unique in this manner. Runtime linking offers some magical powers that Swift will never have, but also doesn’t really need. There are times swizzling might be useful in tests, but otherwise, having written Obj-C for well over a decade, and Swift for nearly a decade, I personally prefer static linking. Runtime exceptions are for chumps. 😉 That being said, macOS and iOS would not be what they are without Obj-C powering them. Much of how everything works, especially all the integrated services, depends on the runtime messaging and dynamic bundle loading features inherited from the language driving it all.
Use the standard libraries provided by Apple. Every library will use the same hardware on the device to get the iPhone location. Third-party tools all will, basically, just call the Apple API's. Nothing will give you a more accurate location than CoreLocation.
Parsing JSON from Swift is pretty simple. You make a model `struct` or `class` and have it adhere to `Codable`. Then you use `JSONEncoder` or `JSONDecoder` to encode and decode it. import Foundation // model struct Foo: Codable { let name: String let apples: Int } // starting instance let start = Foo(name: "Johnny", apples: 12) // encode to JSON if let encoded = try? JSONEncoder().encode(start), let jsonString = String(bytes: encoded, encoding: .utf8) { // JSON text print(jsonString) // {"name":"Johnny","apples":12} // decode from JSON if let data = jsonString.data(using: .utf8), let decoded = try? JSONDecoder().decode(Foo.self, from: data) { // decoded model print(decoded) // Foo(name: "Johnny", apples: 12) } }
Oh no, now we're stuck in a loop!
You don’t even need to bother adding your content to the effects view at all. Easier way is to use transparent background on your top view, then _insert_ the effect view _between_ your top view and the one you want to blur. You can swap it out, change the appearance, and remove it without affecting any of the other views in the hierarchy, including which parent view they have assigned.
To perform some action on the main thread (i.e., a UI action, which should only ever be performed on the main thread) and have the calling thread await its completion and result.
All good questions. I still loved the video. Thanks OP!!!
Fair enough. However, I would counter by stating that writing the private empty init is one line of code, which is better than a one-line comment. From one perspective, writing the private init is more informative, and does not assume that the audience is versed in a non-standard trick. They just have to understand `private`, which is a far more common convention, across language backgrounds. On the other hand, if you’re making this inside of a library, then it will automatically make the constructor `internal` by default, which means you don’t need to write a private init anyway. Point is, class is more appropriate for things that do stuff. Value types are intended for information you want to pass around. There is no practical benefit in not using a class for grouping static methods, only disadvantages. I realize using enum in this way is a popular thing to do, and I am aware because I am a professional Swift developer and encounter many different styles and then some on a daily basis. But I also often have devs ramping up from other platforms, and have found real value in conforming to certain standards and trying to keep things around a fifth-grade level. I’m not saying anyone is wrong for doing it that way, it’s a relatively minor detail. But consider that in the grand scheme of things, it may actually be more harmful than good.
NSAttributedString is such a royal pain sometimes. It’s pretty high on my list of APIs to get modernized/swiftified.
Writing no cases in an `enum` is even more informative. It's fairly apparent that if there are no cases then the `enum` is completely useless as anything but a name. enum MyNamespace { static func doSomething() {} } There really is no ambiguity there, no need for a private empty init, no need for a comment, nothing. class MyNamespace2 { private init() {} static func doSomething() {} } Also unambiguous but doesn't give you much for that extra line of dead code. An extra line just so you can switch one keyword for another, `enum` for `class`. It adds a bit of noise to the definition that you don't need. Yes, it's a small point either way but I'd rather avoid any extra useless code that I can.
I find it’s pretty well designed considering how many different features it drives. What’s your issues with it?
Yep, it's saying exactly what I said.
Mainly it’s not very ergonomic to use in Swift — it very much feels like an Obj-C API. Beyond that, the need to convert back and forth from attributed and mutable attributed is a pain and its range based methods are error prone. There’s a lot that could be done better with it. The a look at practically any Swift wrapper over NSAttributedString to get an idea of where it could be better.
When you want to perform a task on the main thread (like updating UI) where each item needs to complete before the next one starts.
Oh boy. I’ve gone down the rabbit hole you are looking at. Evernote uses a web view under the hood and so do mannny rich text editors. There are some like Bear that use TextViews but they have a lot of resources dedicated to writing their own Storage. It all depends on how what you need to support and what you need it for. If it’s a one off iOS app a text view might be good but as soon as you need to support certain features or convert to HTML you are going to be in a world of hurt. (Apples NSAttributedString to HTML generates some nasty HTML) I tried wordpresses Aztec Editor(UITectView based) but it was buggy and just never quite cut it eventually caved and am using a web view based one now.
Yeah, haha. I’m just trying to make something similar to Apple Notes. Definitely wouldn’t have thought this wasn’t natively supported in UITextView easily. How are you finding the WebView is going?
It’s great. It actually well outperforms Aztec and supports gifs and other stuff for free. I use it to render comments and sometimes have up to 7 of them on the screen at a time. Works surprisingly well... I do have to do a good bit of JS bridging though.
Okay, good to hear. I'm looking at building off a HTML version like this [https://github.com/nnhubbard/ZSSRichTextEditor](https://github.com/nnhubbard/ZSSRichTextEditor) I guess I just thought that using HTML instead of UITextView would be a bit buggy and not perform well...
Yeah. I don’t know about this one. As always just make sure it’s still being maintained
Yep, is there a specific one you use?
Haha. I’m in my own private hell. We have to use [TipTap](https://tiptap.scrumpy.io/) due to our web needs so I made a custom webview/js implementation around that.
lol, okay. Thanks so much for your help!
Synchronization between different threads
Sure! In my case, I usually just use: ``` class Bingo { static func doTheThing() { } } ``` Ensuring you have a private init is really not at all necessary, except for rare cases where it actually matters. But to explore this topic further, let’s say we decide to make the static functions mockable by using: ``` class Bingo { static var doTheThing: ()-&gt;() { } } ``` Callers can access it the same way, but now you can replace implementations when testing. It works with class, enum, and struct. You can still control access privilege through the protocol. However, unless the codebase has established functional paradigms as part of its design, then I would consider this solution undesirable _when applied to this scenario_, even if it was of my own doing. The problem is not that it’s hard to grasp, but simply that it’s unexpected without further understanding. It adds mild confusion, requiring an extra step to decipher what’s going on. Even little speed bumps like using enum when it’s really a class have a cumulative impact. Counting clock cycles in our code never went away, it just shifted to a human CPU. 😉 It all comes down to what might be most expressive to those reading the code. We shouldn’t make the decision because we think we are getting some performance benefit by not using class or even just to avoid writing init. (Just don’t write it.) It’s not so much a technical question as it is one of prose. If it helps to support the intent, then go for it. We devs certainly won’t always agree on what that is, especially in development teams spread around the world. All we can really do is try our best to do what’s right for the code and for our fellow developers, and even with self-imposed constraints, that sometimes requires a bit of luck and intuition.
You can use it in place of locks. It’s actually recommended for performance and readability. https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2017-10-27-locks-thread-safety-and-swift-2017-edition.html
In Swift, Do-Catch does not handle runtime exceptions or fatal errors, and is just the mechanism for handling “regular” errors that get thrown. It’s a great tool for managing error handling in your code, one that is under-appreciated. But even it won’t help you cheat your way around an inappropriate use of force unwrap, I’m afraid. (There are appropriate uses, just not here, not like this.) 😬
Well, given what you seem to be looking for, perhaps try one that jobs in the DC area are looking for. What interests you? Are you into big data? Machine learning? Game engines? Accounting? Music? Now that you know Swift, you might base your decision on a particular solution or field of interest, language is just an implementation detail. Alternatively, you could try expanding your current Swift experience to include cloud applications. It’s not just iOS and Mac. There’s [kitura](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/swift) , [perfect](https://www.perfect.org) , and [vapor](https://vapor.codes) to name a few.
Dont let that person talk you down. Your video still helped a ton of people get comfortable with iOS. Just answer his valid questions and dont get caught up in his snotty tone in his posts. They mean well even if its not communicated appropriately.
Yeah, I was making my own implementation of notification center with typed payloads instead of userinfo dictionary and looked up the swift-corelibs-foundation version of it and it was using lock for adding/querying the observer list when adding to it could be done asynchronously.
Careful. Dispatch deals in queues, not threads. Just because you create your own work queue doesn't ensure it'll ever get its own thread.
Don’t have the proposal number, but the one that added toggle() on the Bool type. I liked the proposal, though.
Ok everyone. I'm stumped :( I am trying to just test out the UITextView so I understand the use case but can't even get this simple block to work. SelectedRange is showing up nil... What have I done wrong??? `func selectText() {` `if let textRange = textView?.selectedRange {` `let attributes = [NSAttributedString.Key.font: UIFont(name: "Arial", size: 18.0)]` `textView.textStorage.addAttributes(attributes as [NSAttributedString.Key : Any], range: textRange) }` `}`
Ok, thank you. I've been trying for the past few hours to test this but I can't get it to work... It's saying that selectedRange is nil. Why is this happening? I'm such a newbie lol `func selectText() {` `if let textRange = textView?.selectedRange {` `let attributes = [NSAttributedString.Key.font: UIFont(name: "Arial", size: 18.0)]` `textView.textStorage.addAttributes(attributes as [NSAttributedString.Key : Any], range: textRange) }` `}`
This is probably correct
This article helped me with a similar issue: [https://medium.com/@hukicamer/determining-the-content-size-of-a-wkwebview-af822756b207](https://medium.com/@hukicamer/determining-the-content-size-of-a-wkwebview-af822756b207)

Without seeing your code it's a bit tricky to know, but my bet is that you're calling some function recursively inside the animations.
I've just stripped down my code to remove almost all animations and auto layout, leaving only the most essential things, and it still gets laggy after 5m of use :c
Can you share your code? Taking a look at it is the only way, really.
do you need to know how to set the label string? &amp;#x200B; @IBOutlet weak var mylabel: UILabel! //connect Outlet in storyboard let mystring = array[index] self.mylabel.text = mystring &amp;#x200B; if not, please post your code so I can exactly see what you need.

Maybe problem is in missing Cocoa Pods or API's of XCode version.
Did you zip a storyboard? Because I have zipped them and they don’t survive unzipping for some reason.
I haven't used external frameworks. But I've used CoreData and those two classes where in projectName.xcdatamodel file
No more ++ operator.
I zipped the whole project but the same project from the zip file is working fine on my other MAC.
&gt;All the files were there and there were no warnings. So my question is how is it possible that the project I sent them was missing two classes? You could have dependencies outside of the Project folder you linked to...? It's not inconceivable that they mixed up projects...
Okay, I just found out I can call a list of apps in the Terminal using "system\_profiler SPApplicationsDataType". If anyone knows how to get this command working in my Swift code? Sorry if this is a really noob question.

Other sources, I fetch a JSON array from a website with app names and version numbers and I want to compare that to the list of apps on my Mac.
It's completely doable, but for one, I wouldn't hire you for zipping a project and two, I wouldn't work with a company that asks for a project to be zipped instead of being uploaded to GitHub of sorts.
They told me to email it...
Don’t ever work for a company that asks for a project to be emailed or zip, that means they don’t know anything about software or computing in general
Just messing around in playground trying to get comfortable with Swift, been programming in python and JavaScript for a while! Must say the syntax is not nearly as rough as I thought!
Lemme guess... C++?
Why would you use the main queue for locks? That essentially guarantees you can never touch the lock(ed object) from the main thread.
C++
Why would you even use segues if they don’t have the convenience of being directly linked? I think segues are generally bad IMO
Yes, this is the description of a doubly linked list. What was the point of the medium post though? You're just repeating information found in every CS structures course and guide. Nothing directly related to Swift, nothing that a [link to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list) wouldn't show us in a clearer manner.
What would be your alternative in this situation? I use segues to transition between VC's as I thought that was necessary. My problem with directly linking to a button, is that it fires automatically and overrides any "if/else" statements
Oh, yeah, I wouldn’t use the main queue this way. I’m speaking to one use of sync vs async in general.
You can use it on an other thread (DispatchQueue) to execute work on the main thread which will pause the current work and execute the work on the main thread before resuming once its done, sort of like calling a synchronous function on an other thread.
The "Pros and Cons of a Doubly Linked List" section appears to be missing. The text there is just an English description of the data structure. The big missing 'con' is: they're brutal on your memory, especially your cache. It allocates lots of tiny pieces of memory all over the place, and then repeatedly traverses them. Unless your write:read ratio is 100:1, or your data set is much larger than your dcache, using a linked list will be slower, more memory-hungry, and more complex than just using an array. "Examples of Using Doubly Linked Lists in Real Life": a music playlist? a deck of cards? an undo stack? No, these are all excellent examples of when a plain array is not only sufficient, but better. "This is where you can reverse the node to get to the previous page." Or if you'd used an array, it'd be a single `DEC`rement instruction on the array index. This is what you get when you translate a 1980's textbook into a modern programming language. For a CPU that has tiny pointers, no cache, and isn't pipelined, linked lists are great. If your CPU is less than 25 years old, you're just shooting yourself in the foot.
Err no! It depends upon the company and who is asking. Large corporations can have Human Resources departments that just don’t know what Github is. That doesn’t mean the programmers are out of touch in the IT department. On the other hand if this is a small business you may have a point. Even here a programming team might have a valid reason to want a packaged submission. It is good to use caution here but a blanket statement that you shouldn’t work for such a company is asinine.
So I actually managed to scrape it together. (To my surprise for sure) now I just need to figure out how to display the label.
When you make the project have it be managed under source control: [Using Source Code Control](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/Xcode_Overview/UsingSourceCodeControl.html) Then you can go to the project directory in the Terminal and do something like: git archive -o latest.zip HEAD Now your entire project should be in a zip file and you can send that.
I tend to dislike segues because of ambiguity and the fact the data passing is done somewhere else than the call site. My preference is either to always instantiate and configure at the call site. Be that either instantiate from storyboard or calling an init on the class, configure it, then push/present it, it’s always more neater and beats a big switch statement in prepareForSegue with string pattern matching every time, and to a reader they know straight away the class your trying to use and what your configuring it with.
Awesome! Thank you for the response. I am coding my first app, so I am quite the novice. I will try to implement more initiations and segmented code.
From my point of view if they don’t know how to use source control I can only imagine how they handle their tickets or bugs or feature requests, not worth it, at least not for me Also HR is usually told what do to after the initial screening by someone from engineering, there really is no reason to ask for a zip.
Huh? I’m not sure where you get the idea that engineering screens applicants first. That isn’t something that happens in most companies. As for source control, large companies handle that internally.
I said after lol, usually where the tech interviews and stuff comes in, HR doesn’t do anything without guidance.

Check out Stanford's free, self-paced online compilers course: https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/Compilers/Fall2014/about At the very least, you should know what the stages of a compiler are (lexing, parsing, semantic analysis, code generation), and what an [abstract syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) is.
**Abstract syntax tree** In computer science, an abstract syntax tree (AST), or just syntax tree, is a tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code written in a programming language. Each node of the tree denotes a construct occurring in the source code. The syntax is "abstract" in the sense that it does not represent every detail appearing in the real syntax, but rather just the structural, content-related details. For instance, grouping parentheses are implicit in the tree structure, and a syntactic construct like an if-condition-then expression may be denoted by means of a single node with three branches. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/swift/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

In Objective-C, the getters and setters are automatically generated for you, I think it’s the same in Swift, unless you override them.
But it's the same in Java. I could declare a public variable and just access and mutate it through the notation: object.prop And in the same way I could just make Swift variables private and use getter and setter methods.
Thank you! I took my compiler class not long after my first husband died, and the subject is understandably foggy.
Good point, I guess more accurately, "sync" is useful for serializing work between multiple threads.
It’s possible the files were referenced on your local and not checked in? I accidentally did that when trying to drag and drop files or images before I knew what the check box in the alert you get when you do that meant.
The reason why you should use getters and setters in Java is that the parent class keeps control on what you get back from the getter and what happens when mutating the value with the setter. Separation of responsibilities. With properties in Swift, the parent class can still keep control using ‘didSet’, ‘get’ and ‘set’ for customizing the property’s behavior. This keeps your code cleaner.
Finishing up my bignums then looking at noise
thats good stuff my friend. Thanks!
Simplicity: [Default Access Levels](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/AccessControl.html#ID7) &gt; All entities in your code (with a few specific exceptions, as described later in this chapter) have a default access level of internal if you don’t specify an explicit access level yourself. As a result, in many cases you don’t need to specify an explicit access level in your code. The architects of the language try to find the default that makes code the easiest. If you need to change from that idea then you can add complexity but most times an access level of internal works just fine. It's assumed that everything within a module is written by the same people and works together so internal is a pretty safe and simple default.
And we’ve come full circle. Swift *is* making getters and setters for the variables behind the scenes. A bit of history on how we got here: In Smalltalk and Objective-C 1.0, all instance variables were private. One had to make a “getter” function to expose the variable. If the variable was writeable to those outside the object then one made a “setter” function as well. Naturally, people wanted object properties because they’re useful, so you made *two to three different declarations* for a property: the instance var, the getter, and sometimes the setter. Actually, do to header files, more like 4 to 6 declarations, but I digress. After people got use to accessing and setting through functions other patterns emerged: * observing changes in a property. The setter could do stuff before the property **willSet** or after it **didSet** * expensive to make properties (usually objects) would be initialized to nil. The getter function would check if the underlying variable was nil and if so then allocate and initialize the property. This is being a **lazy stored property**. * and sometimes one made functions that looked like a property when in fact there was no underlying storage specific to it... it was just a **computed property**. * and to round this out: a property can be made read-only with `private(set)` So Swift comes along and makes these use cases easier. We can make one declaration instead of 2-3 (or 4-6 because header files). If it makes you feel better one can declare the instance vars “private”, prefix the name with an underscore, then make getter/setter functions just like the old days.
Seems Swifty to me! /s
Last I saw, there was no way for a subclass in Java to override the implicit 'get' or the implicit 'set' here. Once you declare it as a public property, it's a naked property for every user and every subclass until the end of time. In Objective-C or Swift, even if you declare it as a simple property, it's trivial to override the automatic 'get' and 'set'.
Wow this looks amazing. Will definitely check it out!
That's a fairly Java-centric practice. In other languages, you don't usually do this. (You *did* learn other languages in your studies, right?) You're not writing getX/setX methods in Lisp or Haskell or even C#.
&gt;Hello, I want to make a MacOS Cocoa app that checks for updates for software I downloaded outside the AppStore. Answering the problem is more importent than answering the proposed solution. People already invented the wheel, you don't need to do it.
Which is great and all, send them a message about it. Or, at the very least a disclaimer "There is a way to do this without creating a Swift program…"
This is dope!
Take a look at this and go to the “Shorthand Setter Declaration” section. “newValue” is simply the default name for the new value in your setter. https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Properties.html
the brackets are closures and you are using it for Computed Properties when you set the value of a var to a closure, the closure executes and return value gets assigned to the variable. when you declared var C (which you shouldn't be using capital initials), it's initial value is 1 because your getter says {return 1} every time you set a new value for C, the set {} executes and sets B to newValue. "newValue" is a default name for the value that will get set, if you don't define one. which in your case = 2. you can define your own value like so, set (yourownvalue) {} and no, there are many ways of using closures.
My old company did code homework screens, and duh, they don't want your code posted on Github because they use the same problem for all candidates. A big problem they had was people opening forks with answers and having to get them deleted, lol.
Today was day 96 of my [100 Days of Swift course](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), so very soon that will be finished and I can begin planning for WWDC – if other /r/swift folks are there too, come and say hello! I also just sent the first version of my new Swift learning app off to Apple for review. It's called Unwrap, and you can find the code on GitHub if you're curious: https://github.com/twostraws/Unwrap Apart from those two, the big thing I'm working on this month is my own Swift conference, Hacking with Swift Live. It's taking place in the UK this July, and all profits are being donated to charity. You can find out more here: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/live
Either SE-0025 (`fileprivate`) or SE-0117, which made public classes not subclassable outside of their current module by default (introducing `open`).
Often there's a few layers of buffer between the person asking for sample code and the candidate (recruiters, managers, etc.). Sometimes they don't know any better and will just ask for someone to attach code to an email. Hell, one time I got a code sample in a Word document...
That's true. Good point well said.
Explaining that it was a default value and giving the way to name your own really helped me understand this. Thank you for taking the time!
Thank you!
I'm pretty sure those brackets are for [code blocks](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Declarations.html#grammar_code-block), not [closures](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Expressions.html#grammar_closure-signature). Closure signatures have a specific set of features, and computed properties don't support almost any of them.
Looking for maybe a YouTube channel or just ideas of some easy beginner apps I can practice building. I feel like I learn better when I’m going “hands on” rather than reading and watching endless tutorials. So any simple things I can try out like a calculator with a nice UI or something? I don’t want to start out doing something crazy complicated and get burnt out or discouraged. I am a newbie. So, baby steps.
This comes up pretty often, and I think it's caused by two things: 1. The seemingly limitless ability for teachers to parrot the same OO practices for decades without any explanation as to their purpose ("Now class, it's critical that you use getters/setters because uhhhh '✨ encapsulation 🌈'" 🙄) 2. The well concealed fact that Swift does not provide any mechanism for accessing instance variables (apart from ObjC interop). I cover all this in my [write-up on this topic.](https://github.com/amomchilov/Blog/blob/master/Stop%20writing%20getters%20and%20setters%20in%20Swift.md) Take a read through that and let me know if you have any questions!
This isn't really about access levels. Direct accesses to instance variables in Java are bad practice because they give no way for the accessed class' instance variables to be changed without an API breaking changing. You can't introduce caching, lazy loading, change out backing storage, or anything like that. Hence you get this proliferation of "getter" methods, whose only purpose (in the short run) is to directly return the value of an instance variable. What people usually leave out of the picture is the true motivation: in the long term, the implementation of the getter method can be changed out, without breaking client code. &amp;#x200B; Public properties are acceptable in Swift (without breaking encapsulation) because their behaviour can be changed (since any stored property can be replaced with a computed of the same visibility/type/name and behave identically for client code) without breaking the API. This distinction is true regardless of the access level applied.
&gt;If it makes you feel better one can declare the instance vars “private”, prefix the name with an underscore, then make getter/setter functions just like the old days. No, definitely don't do that. I cover it in detail in my post, [Stop writing getters and setters in Swift](https://github.com/amomchilov/Blog/blob/master/Stop%20writing%20getters%20and%20setters%20in%20Swift.md), but I suspect you already know everything I say there. I strongly recommend against this practice because it's just added boiler plate that only gives the illusion of improvement. For one, people need to understand that instance variables basically don't exist in Swift.

do you use the storyboard or are you doing it all programmatically? can you post the relevant code?
Tried to do it all programmatically, but I’m from a design background, hard to wrap my head around designing in code. I’m mostly stuck on how to display it on the launch screen. Should I be using a separate view controller and an empty launch screen?
labels can be displayed on the launch screen. in your viewDidLaunch() method add: self.view.addSubview(mylabel) to get the positioning right you might want to add constraints. but still: I am not sure if I am telling you things that you already know, please show your code if possible. &amp;#x200B; if you come from a design background, you might find the storyboard easier to use as you can see how elements interact with each other and how the constraints work, without going through build and run cycles of your code. in the long run this might also help to understand what the programmatically created UI is actually doing and needing. just a little hint.
Alright, I've basically rebuilt the entire animation code in another project, and now it works flawlessly. (The original still lags) Still no idea what was causing it :/

I didn't install the apps through homebrew, but thanks anyway
Thanks, I think this is kinda working but in the log it just gives this error: `2019-05-08 10:37:22.949491+0200 system_profiler[26996:1690147] [logging-persist] cannot open file at line 42270 of [95fbac39ba]` It gives a lot of these error codes. Is this from running the program in Xcode? Doesn't it have the needed rights or something?
That's why you need to reinstall them first.
Why would I do that? You can't install for example VLC media player through brew, I want to check for updates for that kind of apps.
brew cask is for apps with ui, you can install vlc and vlc nightly too. Just type brew cask reinstall vlc. Brew uses appcast for checking updates (if available for an app), you won't get better than that.
Still this isn't what I want to achieve. Okay, VLC was a bad example, there are enough apps which cannot be installed with brew. I just want to check for updates for every app installed that matches a certain list.
If it's not available then make a pull request. Still no need to reinvent the wheel.
but at the backend it accepts "10/10/1000"
But there is a need to change the shape of the wheel for me... It's mostly for learning purposes but I want to have an useful application which checks for updates in the background and some more stuff. Of course there are more easy ways to do something like this but what's the fun of that?
Is there a tool that can show you the ABI level of a binary Swift framework?
And that's what any standard-conforming JSON parser will produce when reading this string.
\`NSRegularExpression\` is still based on the old Cocoa API
Then the backend is buggy. “\/“ should evaluate to “/“ per the JSON spec. We had similar problems in the other direction several years ago and had to fix downloaded strings before passing them off to the JSON parser.
I am having trouble geting any information, I cannot verify if it has worked and the api page on petfinder does it a different way, a way i have not seen before.
\`getJSON()\` uses asynchronous network call, so don't you mind use callback to get result of this call? \`\`\` func getJSON(completion: ((String) -&gt; ())) { doNetworkCall { completion(titleResult) } } \`\`\`
Swift is very powerful in [type inference](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html#ID322). Let's look at method signature: func addTarget(_ target: Any?, action: Selector, for controlEvents: UIControl.Event) Proper call will look like this: ...for: UIControl.Event.valueChanged Since `controlEvents` parameter can be only of type UIControl.Event and `.valueChanged` property is defined statically inside UIControl.Event type, we can omit this type clarification. Think about it as if compiler thinks like this: "Well, this parameter starts with point, so I'll look for it in type. Which type should I use? Aha, signature tells me it's UIControl.Event. Indeed, there is a static property called valueChanged inside UIControl.Event, and it is also of type UIControl.Event, so we can use it here. Okay for me!"
Happy cake day
There are so many shortcomings still with Swift. \`Codable\` turns really ugly when you start to look too close and that's because Swift sucks as a declarative language.
What would you want that to look like? Backslash is an escape character in regex syntax.
Since I'm not familiar enough with REs in those languages, how would this re be written in them? I thought the extra slashes here were due to the need to escape meta characters in the pattern. Also, it should be noted that you shouldn't really be surprised by this as Swift 5 didn't address the RE engine whatsoever. In fact, much of the discussion around raw strings was that it could be leveraged for better UI surrounding RE improvements. The timeline always seemed to be get raw strings hammered out first, then approach the RE issue.
&gt; Why is it that simpler languages like Perl and Ruby solved this problem 25 years ago Perl was originally written specifically for text processing, meaning Larry Wall chose to make regexes extremely accessibly in the language, and I'm pretty sure Ruby chose to follow Perl in this regard. So comparing other languages to Perl with regard to regexes is usually gonna leave you feeling disappointed. But Perl is lacking in features that other languages have. I'm not super familiar with Swift's raw strings or regexes. Are you trying to match strings like `"\(foobar)"`? (With a leading backslash and parentheses literals.) If so, the regex seems fine, since that's how you'd have to write it in most any other language.
How would that look in Perl/Ruby? :)
Very cool thanks for making this!

I generally agree and I would also not like to zip it. But both Gitlab and github (relatively recently) have free unlimited private repos. Githubs (like bitbucket) model is now one where the number of collaborators matter more. However, it’s unlimited collaborators for public repos. (Plus analytics but most standalone free lancers don’t care too heavily on analytics for github**) **nb I’m sure you can find exceptions to the rules but hey free unlimited private repos for up to 3 collaborators!

&gt; I get that the getJSON isn't a string, but how do I get a string from there? The response containing the JSON (if there is one) is passed into the `completionHandler` closure you give to `URLSession.shared.dataTask` which runs asynchronously and itself returns `()`. So how to you "get the string out"? Well, there are two ways: 1. You could use synchronization tools like semaphores to block `getJSON` from completing until the `completionHandler` finishes and then have the `completionHandler` store the string in a captured variable from inside `getJSON` which can then be returned by `getJSON`. But, generally speaking, this is not the way you want to do things 2. Pass the code that operates on the returned JSON into the `dataTask` as a part of the `completionHandler`. So basically, you would have something like: let matched = matches(for: titleresult, in: string) print (matched) inside your `completionHandler`.
It's better to start your result off with an initial value of `1`, so that your loop range can start from `1`. This way you avoid crashes when computing something to the power of `1` (caused by trying to form a range whose lower bound (2) is bigger than its upper bound (1)).
asking the real questions... I too would like to know
Swift 5 escaping was never intended to be the ultimate solution for regular expressions. They even said that right in the swift-evo docs. The example in the release notes was HTML tags, not regexes. On the forums, when people complained that it's still not as good as Perl, they said yes, the goal of Swift 5 is ABI stability, not beautiful regular expressions. There is a truly epic proposal floating around for how to make string matching more Swifty (and not "a blob of cryptic characters, just like CTSS had in the 1960's"). If this is what you care about, I suggest you hunt it down and help contribute to that. I think you'll find that any string matching system will either need multiple layers of escaping, or multiple types of quoting. You want to be able to *match* any characters, and you're typing the match pattern *using* characters. Something's gotta give.

I'm just having trouble getting the label to link into the IBOutlet if it's on the launch screen *"cant assign custom classes to launch screen"* or something like that import UIKit class ViewController: UIViewController { var quotes = ["Default Quote"] @IBOutlet weak var QuotesLabel: UILabel! override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() QuotesLabel.textColor = UIColor.white QuotesLabel.contentMode = .scaleAspectFit QuotesLabel.layer.cornerRadius = 10.0 QuotesLabel.adjustsFontSizeToFitWidth = true QuotesLabel.minimumScaleFactor = 0.2 QuotesLabel.numberOfLines = 1-10 if let quote = quotes.randomElement() { QuotesLabel.text = "\(quote)" } } }
This is a terrible, contrived example. Regex by necessity has a lot of special characters, and those special characters need to be escaped no matter what the implementation if you need to match them literally. All you did was make an example regex that contained a bunch of those special characters so that it would have a bunch of backslashes. What is the use-case even for matching something with the pattern `\(some_string)`?
Try including only your Swift source files. Unless you're shipping resources, those should be all you need.
Like exclude the project file and head file? My file structure is as follows: (from the Xcode template) MyLib.proj/ MyLib/ |_ Classes/ |_ Info.plist |_ MyLib.h I don't need anything else?
No, you only need the actual source required to build your framework. Something like: `s.source_files = 'Source/*.swift'`
 my $regex = /([^)]+)/ ;
 my $regex = qr|([^)]+)| ;
Thank you, this worked to remove all the warnings! As for the 2 errors, they were only fixed upon reinstalling Xcode as they only showed up in my development environment.
 my $regex = '\([^)]+\)';
 my $regex = '\([^)]+\)' ;
You forgot the first backslash.
Which way? Could you elaborate
It may be easier for you to do something like this with a tool like [https://www.hammerspoon.org](https://www.hammerspoon.org)
&gt; my $regex = '\([^)]+\)' ; Um… that's not the same regex. The Swift one you gave matches a leading backslash before the initial paren, this one doesn't. I.e given the string `"boo \(mystring) hoo"`, the Swift regex will match `\(mystring)`, but the one you give here matches `(mystring)`. If you want to match the leading backslash, you'll need to put another two backslashes at the start of your regex.
You seem to be quoting a version I submitted a few seconds before I corrected it to include escaped parens. If you refresh the page you should see the escaped version.
I'd want it to look like the Perl, Ruby or Kotlin version, ie. not having to escape backslashes unless they're literal. I shouldn't need 3 backslashes to escape an opening paren.
Swift isn't exactly new anymore - we're at version 5 now. Isn't that long enough to wait for a "feature" which less capable languages such as Perl, Ruby and Python have had for 25 years? Java has the same issue but Kotlin, which is only a library after all, managed to solve it.
Add PHP, Python and Javascript to the list. None of them have this over-escaping issue.
No, I'm quoting one that has been up for two hours and has not been edited (I just refreshed a couple of times to triple-check). Also, the issue is not with escaped parens, it's that the one I quoted does not match the backslash that comes before the opening paren, the Swift one does.
You mean barcode? https://www.appcoda.com/barcode-reader-swift/
Yea I meant barcode ! And thanks a lot I appreciate your response .
Uh well you didn't answer my question. What are some example string literals you're matching? Because if they look like the example I wrote, then Python at least would have an identical regex pattern.
No worries, this is the same tutorial i used and i made a fully fledged app out of it 😊
You should really give me some tips/advice! I need all the help I can get haha
Yeah, could give you a few pointers. What kind of app are you trying to build?
Very cool. Thank you, my friend.
awesome link
[removed]
Thanks for putting Unwrap out there for free. Downloading now and I’ll give it try!
An app that can scan barcodes , and an app similar to tinder. I was hoping you could give me some tips on how to understand coding better.
honestly this suggestion is too vague. programming is something that you learn best through practice. the more you code the easier you see patterns and understand why it’s better to code in certain ways. if you want to learn these ways of coding (design patterns / best practices / coding conventions) there are tons of resources but it’s a broad field. asking how to best understand code is like asking what’s the best way to understand — something as broad as — mathematics. if you want to understand iOS software development specifically, one place to start with is try and learn the app life cycle, and how it relates to the view controllers (like when and which methods get automatically called like `ViewDidLoad()`) it’s not easy and it takes a lot of persistence but I hope this helps. (and I am by no means an expert but I did just finish my computer science minor)
Anything helps ! Thanks for replying . I’ll probably do something small like making a simple game as practice.
I would start by following that tutorial first, as it does not require connectivity, just camera, it’ll be easier to start with. Then read up on CoreData if you want persistence in your data. But yeah, you’ll need to learn the basics before jumping into that tinder thing.
Got it ! Thanks for replying and your time .
this looks like you are actually using storyboard. In storyboard on you launchscreen select the identity inspector and assign a custom class by selecting ViewController (your class from example) to be used as the launchscreens class. otherwise it will use the default class which does not contain you custom code. &amp;#x200B; the IBOutlet is also connected to the storyboard by connecting it to your class, which will generate the line into your class code. So the line @IBOutlet weak var QuotesLabel: UILabel! should not exist before connecting the label. so you would need to delete it in order to do the following: &amp;#x200B; to connect the label to your class open the assistant editor from your storyboard. make sure it displays your storyboard in one editor and your assigned ViewController class in the newly opened editor. you can than use drag &amp; drop while holding ctrl to drag the label from your storyboard into your class, this will add the IBOutlet line and the storyboard connection. drag the label from the element list hierarchy, you are doing it right if a blue line appears .it will ask you for a name, as you already have code using the QuotesLabel here should be best. &amp;#x200B; by the way: best practice is using lowercase names for variables, objects and methods, and uppercase for classes and types. so you should consider renaming it to quotesLabel. however, this will not change how your code works. &amp;#x200B; the view.addSubview() method from my previous comment is only needed when doing it programmatically, and is not necessary when using storyboard and IBOutlets. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; if your quotes array is of type \[String\], then quote from if let quote = quotes.randomElement() { will be a String, so QuotesLabel.text = "\(quote)" can be replaced by QuotesLabel.text = quote
But your regex matches a backslash and then the open paren.
And what's the doNetworkCall? It just says it's an unresolved identifier.
Okay, now I have this code: func getJSON(completion: @escaping ((String) -&gt; ())) { let jsonUrlString = "LINK HERE" guard let url = URL(string: jsonUrlString) else { return } URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, err) in guard let data = data else { return } do { let titleresult = try JSONDecoder().decode([GetTitle].self, from: data) print(titleresult) completion (titleresult) } catch let jsonErr { print("Error serializing json:", jsonErr) } }.resume() } But for `completion (title result)` it gives this error: `Cannot convert value of type '[GetTitle]' to expected argument type 'String'`
Are there any good articles on iOS caching, not caching data myself, but learning what iOS caches itself. I have been working with bluetooth and things such as device name seem to be cached and sometimes not update to reflect the actual device name after change.
Hmm, I added your line from the second option but it cannot resolve identifier "titleresult", probably because it's in another function and can't be called from the matchStrings function. Sorry I'm such a noob lol, this is probably an easy thing to fix 😅
&gt; Hmm, I added your line from the second option but it cannot resolve identifier "titleresult" I'm guessing that's because you added it in `matchStrings`, rather than inside your completionHandler, where `titleresult` was defined. Having said that, I also see a huge problem I missed with your original code. you are doing: let string = (getFiles()) let matched = matches(for: getJSON(), in: string) but `getFiles()` returns `Void` rather than `String`, so you're passing `()` into the `in` parameter of `matches`, which expects a `String` there. That's what was actually causing your initial error, though you'd run into what I described with `getJSON()` anyway, as that problem still exists. What exactly is `getFiles()` supposed to return? &gt; Sorry I'm such a noob lol, this is probably an easy thing to fix 😅 Sort of, but also sort of not. Asynchronous flows can be tricky, and how you approach them really depends on what you're trying to do. So before I can even try to help, I need to know what is it you think you are trying to do?
This is a really useful set of examples if you are willing to dive into Blockchain.
this is always a good place to start 🙂 tic tax toe is simple yet can be surprisingly complex to code.
Good bot
The raw string shouldn't treat backslashes as special characters at all.
In java you can create an inmutable class, but still, you will have to create the getters anyway. Many languages, even Kotlin ease that job by creating them by default, so we override what we need
It does whatever you want it to do, and you use them when you want to delegate something. This one is obviously a custom protocol (for which you haven't given us source code or documentation) so only by reading the program can you know what it's for. Did you bother googling for "delegate" on developer.apple.com? There's plenty of documentation on this concept.
You're going to have to include a lot more code because this bit is fairly meaningless by itself. The property `delegate` could be any type that has those methods defined on it. Also, please post code as text, not images. It makes it easier for others to copy, edit, work with and help you out.
Not a fair comparison. You're using the *version number* of Swift, but the *calendar age* of Perl/Ruby/Python. Ruby is still at version number 1.x, but nobody would say that means Swift is 5 times as mature. Ruby is the youngest of these, and at 24 years old, it's still over 20 years ahead of Swift. As programming languages go, Swift is still very new. That's exactly what you're complaining about. I think what you really should be complaining about is that they bumped the version number up to 5 so fast. No other programming language called itself "5" after only 4 years, and it causes people to say silly things like "Swift isn't exactly new anymore - we're at version 5 now".
The title makes it appear that the video is about an older version of Swift.
&gt;The title makes it appear that the videos are about an older version of Swift. ups. My mistake.
Yeah, the app is definitely written for Swift 5, and will be updated for 5.1 and beyond in the future. Let me know what you folks think!
Create an empty project reproducing your problem with minimal code and share it. We don't have enough information here to help. But problem is probably that your SDK is retaining your controller which it shouldn't do anyway as it shouldn't be responsible for presenting/dismissing it.
As said, you are passing a callback expecting (User?, Error?), but you are passing (User?, NSError?)
... and by the way, remove your auth data.
It isn't – regex is.
 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation\_pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_pattern)
I was thinking of doing that . Haha I’ll give it a try!
Do I have to explicitly set a Root View Controller on a NavigationController or can I just push a ViewController and that becomes the Root?
FYI, you posted your login email address and password - while the password seems to be randomly generated, you might want to change it and keep your authentication info in another file
The code in 3 is very heavily butchered and its hard to tell you anything for sure (like those random blocks, etc.). But basically it seems like your createVC method serves purpose as just a basic factory where it creates a viewcontroller as a self owner, but then I see that your SDKManager (owned by viewcontroller and somewhere in step 1) is also having some kind of a block variable, which retains your controller (which ones again retains your SDKManager with that block). Not going to ask you why you need this complex architecture, but for now you should look into using weak references of controller in the block, or not making a viewcontroller as an SDKManager owner (adapt architecture).
yeah both are not real, but thanks.
it is not real, I put fake auth data
I see what you are saying; this is escaping the regex's backslashes, not Swift's. Yeah OP's complaint seems invalid
Wait what, your professor doesn't know how to do something he is trying to teach you?
Yeah and he linked a video from two version ago.. and this is his final.
We learn basic code but not how to do code in table view controllers
&gt;Yeah and he linked a video from two version ago.. and this is his final. Well I'm not going to give you the answer but here is a Gist. Put a UIImageView in a ViewController and a button under it, you will link the button to an IBAction corresponding to said View Controller on said IBAction you will set the corresponding image and voila.
Why does this need a Table View Controller? sounds like you just need 2 elements on your Xib.
He gave us this https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/11/designing-app-idea-sketch-xcode/ Tutorial for the app and in the tutorial it uses table view controller
The tutorial is basically a page with a button that adds to cart, it has no similarity to a single UIImageView + a button that changes the image, what exactly is your assignment? and damn I'd hate to be with your teacher, either he's really bad at teaching or you're really bad at explaining.
 Your app should include a "Action Button", that will change an image based on the selection. Your app should include a "Calculation". You will need a textbox, convert string to int, calculate and then convert text to string to display. This might be summing of qty * price or value of items listed on your App. (cell#1). Here are the requierements
Yeah you're bad at explaining lmao, at least try to work out some of the logic in Xcode Playgrounds and come back and ask for tips, I'd help you if it wasn't your final.
You know, there was a hardware company (probably multiple ones) who made an electrostatic system across the screen that produced around a dozen different textures as you moved your finger, from concrete to corduroy. And that was nearly a decade ago. I thought at least that tech would have found its way into devices by now. I tried out a very early haptic system that involved a styled attached to a reticulating arm. The arm would halt the movement of the stylus, simulating contact with a given surface. The works could simulate a variety of surfaces, some with give, some like glass. And even a cumbersome primitive set up like that was amazing.
I own a gym/fitness studio and I'm building an app for our members and other gyms!
If you're simulating this it will be hard for the notification to popup, the GPS has to literally detect you left the zone and entered it again for your code to work, if you're simply moving inside the fence it will never show it.
So it does print “added” when I plug in the custom location to the simulator, just doesn’t give any notifications.
Switching threads is only a mater of dispatchQueue.main.asyc{} and core data it not thread safe either. I personally use realm in all of my projects because the performance is great, it’s easy to export the data, and when done properly the code is really clean. However I have seen some really nasty realm implementations so your mileage may vary.
Databases are single owner resources. You want a single controller object (or a set of objects with more complex databases) managing everything about them and passing "copies" of the elements around instead of objects that are tied to the database. This is called the repository pattern.
Core Data in itself is very powerful, if you can, avoid using third party libs to do what you can natively.
Core Data gets a lot of hate because it simply doesn't work the way you expect a "database" to work, but I find that I keep coming back to it because it's extremely powerful.
This is how I had it with sqlite.
Each of these are very different datastores. &amp;#x200B; SQLite is a more traditional compact relational database, you're storing rows and columns of data, and must manually decide if/how that data maps to the properties of your individual objects. &amp;#x200B; CoreData is an object store - you do not get access to the rows/columns of the data, nor should you care about it. You give it an object &amp; relationships to store. &amp;#x200B; Realm is also an object store, but unlike CoreData is not tied specifically to Apple-based programming languages which may give you more portability. &amp;#x200B; You need to just pick the one that fits your needs :)
Once u get over and understand how to use realm with background threads it becomes pretty great. Basically you gotta use the reference safe thingy every time u wanna move an object from thread to thread. U could also just pull the object again in the background instead but you ll need to initialize a new realm instance. Pretty much u cant use a realm instance and its objects from one thread to the other. Good luck!
Yeah. I’m leaning to Sqlite since I’m most familiar with it. But I’m afraid that it is too much traditional.. If I’m gonna use this project for career reference it needs to have things that peole consider good practise. If you know what I mean. I would probably be able to use all 3 things -.-. If I decide to use Sqlite, do you have any reference how to use it correctly - database handler...
I want to compare a list of application names on my Mac to a JSON list to check for updates that way. So with the getFiles function I get a list of all the .app files in my applications folder. I guess it works since it outputs a list with all the .app files fine.
Looks like in your completion handler you are using the autocompleted template instead of naming them in the block. You should make it ‘user, error in’ and then your code should work.
Realm is the best here. Powerful, fast, cross platform. It's an absolute pain to manage to different code bases for iOS and Android AND two different databases. Why do that when Realm is there for you. I don't get why anyone would recommend core data are all. If you want to make your iOS available outside of Apple, you cannot use Core Data.Plus, core data was built upon Sqlite.
You've told us nothing about what you're doing, except it's "an app". People reading this have no basis for making any recommendations for you. Mapping problems to solutions is a developer's job. If there were a single best answer to "Which database", then there wouldn't be all these options. See also: "I'm making a building. Which building material to use?"
Then your subscriber isn't a JSON parser, and your requirements on the publishing side are stricter than simply *encoding JSON*. You need to generate a string with a specific format (which just happens to be fairly similar to JSON).
"Raw parsing" isn't a well-defined term. What do *you* want it to mean? In what sense do you want this to be "on par with" libraries like SwiftyJSON? 42.
CoreData is not a database, it is a framework to manage graphs which are a collection of entities and relationships. Core data uses a persistent store for storage which is usually SQLite. If the data storage you're doing is light, I recommend realm.
I like it. Good work!
That truly depends on how rough your MVP is. Do you have a rough idea?
YapDatabase
That's because it's not really a database. It's backed or rather usually backed by one but it's really a persistent storage for model objects. That's sounds databasey so people still try. I find if I need an actual database (like storing precomputed data in the bundle or need advanced queries) sqlite with a good framework like GRDB is pretty great. But yea it gets hate because it's used incorrectly. My beef with it these days is that since it's 100% objective c runtime it's hard to use it in swift with swift like coding practices and objects. Not a huge deal though.
Honest advice, start with smaller projects like a tic tac toe app to learn how to use swift and other development tools; if you try a large project you might get discouraged / overwhelmed. &amp;#x200B; You don't just try to run a marathon without first training for several weeks / months. Smaller projects are your way of training. &amp;#x200B; But if you want to create a game like [polytopia](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/the-battle-of-polytopia/id1006393168?mt=8), I would first first with learning how to create a simple app like tic tac toe to learn how to use buttons and other UI elements to trigger actions, and how to build some game logic. &amp;#x200B; Second I would work on building an app with segues (transitions between views) and being able to transfer data between views (like which player won) &amp;#x200B; Third I would learn how to save data persistently, so that when you close the app you can continue a saved game, look into things like CoreData. &amp;#x200B; I am no expert myself, but this is a process that will take a long time to build (months / years) — but these are the projects that are the most fulfilling.
It is going to be really important is to abstract the DB implementation. Use protocols etc. to separate concerns. You’ll then find yourself able to change/adapt overtime, should you choose to do so.
Realm was recently bought, which doesn’t necessarily bode well for its future.
Great work! Well put together. &amp;#x200B; Too bad Material is IMO so ugly, but that's not on you. Thanks for contributing this.
It’s worth considering that Ensemble Studios employed around 100 people. Your task if you wanted to make AoE again would be somewhat simpler due to modern hardware and libraries, but it’s still probably out of reach for almost any one person. Perhaps start with something like just a character that moves to where you click? For a significantly more challenging follow up to that, add terrain that can block the direct path and do path finding. riconaranjo’s suggestions are also good
With regards to Realm being mentioned personally I wouldn’t start a new Realm project since it’s been bought by MongoDB, they have said they have no plans to shut it down currently but with what happened to Parse with Facebook I’d stick to CoreData.
Maybe it is overkill, but I did not found any other solution for our problem. Basically client app needs to instantiate SDKManager, and then create a ViewController, which is in our framework and present it from application viewController. The thing is that, if our own framework calls **self**.navigationController?.dismiss(animated: **true**) **Then no retained cycles occur.** I wonder why is that?
Thanks. this is before: completion: { (user:User?, error:Error?) **in** do you mean: completion: { (user:User?, error in:Error?) ?
I wouldn’t go so far as to say it’s ugly, but more out of place on iOS.
Shameless plug: https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/sqlite-ios-apps (TL/DR: Takes you through building a Swift app with a class wrapped around SQLite3, no Core Data required.)
I mean completion: { (user:User?, error in:Error?) ? Should be completion: { user, error in
I have the same probs

Yeah, I see your point. I’m not a fan of third party stuff in my projects, but usually write a few extensions to solve the biggest pain points. For example extending NSParagraphStyle with a convenience init(alignment:) to make it inlineable.
I honestly like using SQLite directly a lot. The learning curve is very low if you have any SQL experience. I wrote a minimalist Swift wrapper around the SQLite 3 C APIs just to make it a little more comfortable to use.
Thank you!
*cries in google* but thank you! To be honest, when our UI guy brought up the idea I was very defensive about it, as if he was desecrating my love of iOS development. But like many ideas he had, I ended up doing it anyways (and liking it).
Well. I’d say it’s ugly.
Is there any swift playground examples with cards/card games and card dragging and dropping examples? I tend to find drag and dropping “multitasking” articles which isn’t what I’m looking for.
Did you set the class of the VC in Interface builder correctly?
UserDefaults
Save the time on the device when the button was pressed in NSUserDefaults. Next time app is launched/comes back from multitask check if the day has passed. Remember the user can change the bour and date on the device so if it's sensitive you want a backend and a dataase which records the time.
[use this](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplication/1623059-significanttimechangenotificatio)
If this is business critical, don't use the `UserDefaults` approach as it's easily modified by the user. The options would be using the Keychain instead (can me modified in jailbroken devices) or simply having an endpoint in your API that the app can request whenever the button is shown.
If it’s sensitive, it’d be safer to store it in Keychain. Plus, no database needed
Up to iOS 10 keychain on a jailbroken device could be modified, not sure after. Also firebase would be perfect with anon login
Is there a good book and/or set of flash cards for someone just now learning to dip their toe into coding. I went to Barnes and Noble to look for a Swift for Dummies book but didn’t see anything.
I'm currently planning an update to a project I called [Provincial](https://github.com/JoshHrach/Provincial), a dataset of US and Canadian states. I built it initially to power a UIPicker. I'm now going to: - Clean up Provincial itself - Add a built in UIPicker for selecting a country/state
Set the content title and body
You could put your files in the sandboxed directory for your build
Is it possible to write whole frontend webpages in swift?
The reduce can be read like this: var currentElement: T? = .none var count = 0 array.forEach { element in if element != currentElement { currentElement = element count = count + 1 } }
thx
Sorting is costlier for high count, you could just create a set from the array and return it's count.
 func countUniques&lt;T: Comparable&gt; (_ array: Array&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; Int { let sorted = array.sorted() let initial: (T?, Int) = (.none, 0) let val = sorted.reduce(into: initial) { ( _ acc:inout (T?,Int), _ item:T?) in acc.1 = (acc.0 == item ? acc.1 : acc.1 + 1) acc.0 = item } return val.1; } countUniques([1,2,3,3,4,4,5,6]) //result is 6 Sorry for awful formatting, but I took a stab at re-writing the method to make it slightly more clear, using actual variable names, to get rid of the shorthand parameter access, which I think makes the initial example super confusing and hard to follow. Essentially [array.reduce](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array/2298686-reduce) takes an initial result (commonly referred to as an accumulator) and a closure to operate on that result (Commonly used to add it up). In this case, the accumulator (first param of reduce) is a tuple with both the current number and the total count of uniques. The idea of the closure is that because the values are sorted, it keeps track of the current number it's looking at in the first field of the tuple, then in the second it increments the count of unique values. Every turn of the loop updates the tuple, so on each pass, the value at acc.0 is the previous value in the array, and the value acc.1 is the number of unique items. So the reduce pass at the end will return a tuple, where we just ignore the first field. &amp;#x200B; Does this help at all?
\*this is what it feels like, React Native\*
The code snippet above is quite unnecessary. You could just use a `Set(array).count`.
I was just about to answer with this. Far easier than the original code and probably as fast or faster.
👌Good remark, I forgot to mention that. Not so rare to let type conforming to Comparable to also conform to Hashable
Of course, it was a massive team that make a massive job, honestly I thought all that about click a character and move was a simple task nowadays 😅
Well, I want to make a rough mvp of a game that is played very much like AoE I or II and all the changes are on top of that, on how you develop your civilization. I’m making a sort of whitepaper and want to search for people who gets interested to develop the game logic based on how historically the systems of thought shaped societies and I actually thought that make a really basic mvp on top of something like the real AoE would be easier
This is less a question about Swift, but more about Web Assembly. It’s not possible to manipulate the DOM (the visual part of a website) from Web Assembly, so also not from Swift. You can only write business logic. You might want to read further about it’s implications and limitations of Web Assembly.
You can't push if you're not inside a Nav VC.
I love this book: https://itunes.apple.com/us/book-series/swift-programming-series/id888896989?mt=11
You're going to have to elaborate
you can. that example is just showing you that you can combine different strings stored in variables together.
thank you! That makes sense now ;)
You could, but I think the book is trying to show you how to use variables to form a string. So for example, if you asked the user for the value of “friend” then you’d need that friend variable mixed with the string. Ultimately this is just a bad example.
Would the second line have to read var instead of let: var friend = “Jude” to change the name of the friend so it could say “Good Morning Joe”, if you changed Jude to Joe? Would that work ? 😂 I don’t know if I’m getting it
That's some pretty awful code, to the point where I feel like it's an exercise in how obfuscated you can get while still technically conforming to some kind of reasonable style. The use of two anonymous arguments, ordered access to members of a tuple, and the numbers 0 and 1 all in close proximity is a hard-to-unravel mess that would be made much better through some short-but-meaningful variable names. &amp;#x200B; Also, as others have noted, Set(array).count is faster is so much easier to read, even if it does require Hashable.
Yeah, that’s one reason I said it’s a terrible example. But they were probably just trying to show you could mix variables and strings
I understand! Thank you!!
If data integrity matters, the server should never trust the client on anything. Clients should report user actions, and the server should compute the resulting state. Trusting client-reported state lets fake clients report whatever they want.
No server, no problems
Neither. Your login system should be UI agnostic. Your AppDelegate should do as little logic as possible.
the logic of AoE is quite complex, so that will take a long time to figure out on its own. Exponentially so if you’re trying to learn how to program at the same time. your question seems to be more about game development rather than swift / iOS so perhaps look in subreddits related to those concepts.
Dm me
Probably :) at least if you're using something like a game engine or spritekit. Good to start with because it's simple, and you can go from there.
👆
Sorry, there is no good advice to be had here. You should not be teaching computer science without any knowledge of the subject. This is simply a bad idea.
you're telling me....
Why would I dm you.
thx, that helps.
Sorry you're in that position, I have a family full of teachers and I would hate for them to have to do this. I had a teacher long ago who was teaching Pascal and was learning it in college at the same time. It was tough because I knew the language more than she did and I ended up teaching more of the students because she was barely a lesson ahead of our class. Suffice it to say that very few people learned much there, it was just a bad situation.
I was interested in the position
have them do research on a topic and present their findings to the rest of the class
Which book is this ?
Not yet: one of our long-term goals is to build something like [Rust's wasm-bindgen](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) or [ASP.Net Core's Blazor](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor), to allow Swift code interact with JavaScript and the DOM. We're currently focused on integrating our changes back to upstream Swift, so we haven't started on web bindings yet: if you would like to help, you can [join us on Github](https://github.com/swiftwasm).
According to the demo, we can now even run javascript from swift in webassembly. The internet has gone too far.
What about the How to Think Like a Computer Scientist book? It's not Swift, but Python comes with a Mac so you could start next week. &amp;#x200B; [https://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html](https://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html)
I typically create two separate view stacks (one for auth, the other being the actual app), then in the app delegate, upon initialization, I check if an auth token is present and choose the root vc accordingly
That’d be some proper schadenfreude!

Coding iPhone apps for kids: A playful introduction to swift by Gloria winquist and Matt McCarthy
NEVER build it in the first view controller. Build it in its own class and call it from the right spot.
Tip - indent 4 spaces and Reddit will format it as code
That's a big improvement! OP's code here requires it to be `Comparable`. It's much easier to make something `Hashable`. The online docs list over 3600 types which are `Hashable`, and only 24 which are `Comparable`.
Damn it autocorrect
Right now you can, albeit through a shim that calls into JS functions. What you’re referring to is the pending spec for doing it without a shim, which is more of an nice-to-have optimization than a blocker. See examples/todomvc for example in rust’s stdweb repo https://github.com/koute/stdweb
Hmm, that's true. For some reason I mixed up `Comparable` and `Equatable` when I read OP's code. You're right that `Hashable` is probably simpler, given the recent changes to adhering to it.
Well, not exactly. They have a fork of swift which works with some simple test cases. You should check out the PR to the swift repo linked - lots more work to do, though so much progress has been made! It’s nice to see the efforts have a home on this webpage.
Learn DispatchGroup
What’s the target membership of the files? Do they belong to the Unit Test target or the main App target?
Awesome app! I would love it if it had examples on how a certain codes work and are used in apps. Examples are just my personal way of learning anyway.
`let semaphore = DispatchSemaphore(value: 0)` &amp;#x200B; `for i in 0 ..&lt; 10 {` `Database.database().reference().child("chatGroup\(i)").child("users").child("uid").observeSingleEvent(of: .value, with: { (snapShot) in` `let userCount = snapShot.children.allObjects.count` `self.arrayCount.append(userCount)` `print(userCount)` `self.semaphore.signal()` `})` &amp;#x200B; `semaphore.wait()` `}` `//array count does not update, i want to wait til the for loop is done to print it` `print("arrayCount")` `}` &amp;#x200B; This should work. Learn more about [semaphores](https://medium.com/swiftly-swift/a-quick-look-at-semaphores-6b7b85233ddb) or [dispatch groups](https://www.google.pt/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiPx6ba_JLiAhVdAmMBHfHkDDAQFjAAegQIAhAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fjordansmith.io%2Fdispatch-groups-in-swift-3%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw0FVS3VHKpWBAjNP6AtwAm5).

Are you also a beginner to programming in general?
yes 100% ahah
Just ask the questions I guess. You may not always get an answer but most of the times you will. I started my Swift journey on iPad Playgrounds, too. Didn't write a line of code before that. It's a pretty solid place to start learning how to code. And what I learned was that the more I struggled to find solutions to those annoyingly tricky problems the more information I could retain. So, at times, you are going to have to bang your head against the wall trying to find some answers on your own. It's part of the process. As for the other questions that you simply don't know whom to ask and also since you're a complete beginner, I think I should be able to answer most of your questions. Would also give me a chance to refresh and solidify my knowledge of Swift so far. DM me if you like.
Find a local meetup. I’ll be honest, you should look to contribute as much as you’re looking to get out of it just to be a good citizen. People are generally welcoming towards beginners and will at the very least help you know where to look and how to master certain concepts so that you eventually have the fundamentals down.
Thank you so much I really appreciate it!! I will definitely take you up on that. It’s nice to read you started off the same way!!
Thank you! I was hoping the community would be supportive. I don’t have anything to contribute (yet) but can’t wait until I can!
Try and DM me sometimes, I should be able to help
Ask them and we will try to help. I am just learning swift but I can try to answer. I bet others with more knowledge will try to do the same! Sharing knowledge is good for everybody!
Thank you so much! I appreciate it :)
Thank you so much!! :)
Feel free to DM me, I always think helping others with questions gives you a different perspective on things and eventually will teach yourself some stuff.
Various ways to do this, but the cleanest and most commonplace implementation would be to throw your print statement in the closure.
Thank you all for your suggestions!! I ended up solving the issue by using dispatch groups. Here is the code: `for var i in 0 ..&lt; 10 {` `i += 1` `group.enter()` `Database.database().reference().child("chatGroup\(i)").child("users").child("uid").observeSingleEvent(of: .value, with: { (snapShot) in` `let userCount = snapShot.children.allObjects.count` `self.arrayCount.append(userCount)` `print(userCount)` `self.group.leave()` `})` `}` `group.notify(queue: .main) {` `print("done with tasks")` `completion()` `}`
Trainwreck? O.o &amp;#x200B; Essentially what happens, is that your callback is being called (10 times) after you print "arrayCount" (which is a string btw). This is due to the usual run loop behavior: Adding commands to the end of it. &amp;#x200B; The question is, why do you want to wait for the loop to end before you do something? If you want to wait for the entry, just call an update within the callback.
I’ve learned more in 4-5 months after joining a meetup group than 2 years of coding by myself. I kept hearing this same message over and over again. Remember that the ultimate reflection of knowledge is being able to teach. If you find a good group, they’ll be eager to help with answering questions. I agree that you have to be ready to contribute in one way or another.
&gt;schadenfreude Wait… schadenfreude is an english word? :D Crazy times!
Do you have slack? Join ios- developers.slack.com
Have you done the apple provided swift tutorials? They have a walkthrough that teaches you swift.
so is there really nothing I can do? I was thinking of handing out a loops task/assignment but not sure where to start. Tried looking online and there isn't much out there. Even a template of code is hard to find.
Also, when searching for information with google, first type “Swift iOS” and then your question. More than likely you will get a relevant answer from StackOverflow, or raywenderlich.com in the first few results. That will serve you well until you get to figuring out best practices.
Check out hackingwithswift.com. It’s step by step and gets you to writing apps right away. There’s a great intro to Swift there too. Also, just check out Apple’s Swift documentation. With both of those you should be able to put together a beginner’s curriculum.
Same
If that’s the case, I’d definitely recommend going through an online course on learning programming in general. I’m sure there are courses for swift in particular for somebody with no software background. When I was learning swift I used [ray wenderlich](https://raywenderlich.com) and it was immensely helpful.

It’s one of those concepts that English has no good equivalent word for… you’d be stuck writing out a whole sentence to convey the idea, and so the German word is familiar and somewhat commonly used among native English speakers.
https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript
That’s what it’s all about :)
This is a good approach. The community there is very friendly and there are plenty of people who are just starting too.
There are a few routes one might take to achieve this. Most would probably host a service on the web that your app requests the thoughts from. You can then change and upload thoughts to your heart's content. Others might deploy the app with a database of thoughts preprogrammed. You could then "patch" additional thoughts with a configuration update or even app update. The web server route is the most obvious and easy route. But it does require you host that data somewhere.
There are some good meetups. Look for LearnSwift. LearnSwift LA is pretty good. LearnSwift Boston is great, really smart devs there.
Me too. Don’t know anything. Created some apps in shortcuts app though. https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1690
u/twostraws has your back. https://youtu.be/X2RZlmjLYhk
I’d say join the CocoaHeads slack. I’m there, anyway, and often field annoying questions with good humor. https://join.slack.com/t/cocoaheads/shared_invite/enQtNjMwMDY1NTU5NzAyLTI0OTczODdmMzNlM2FjNmE1ZjQ4ZTRiYTBiZjM2MThkMTExOTNmM2IwZmIxMzZiMzhmYTkzYmRjNWU1YWFmMjI
Thank you I appreciate it a lot!!
Thank you I will look at it!!
Life saver, thank you!
Thanks for the answer. I guess I’ll get looking into web server hosting! One quick follow up if you don’t mind- does this mean I have to design a website, or can I get a service integrated into my app which will let me do this?
Do you know about others? I know about kindergarten and some traditional food like currywurst or bratwurst.
Currently building an app to show users where to find the closest/best place to hang a hammock, as well as allow them to post their favorite spots. Planning on it being my first publish to the App Store!
I totally understand. We're in the very early stages of figuring out what role Swift would play on the web, but I do know that there's a lot of existing interests and work on Swift-native UI frameworks (with even Apple rumoured to [be working on this area](https://daringfireball.net/2018/04/scuttlebutt_regarding_ui_project)), so a Swift-native web UI framework is definitely something we want to explore.
You don't need a whole site, simply a service that responds with the thought based on your query. You could simply share the thoughts on Reddit and query your post history from the app.
Changing the content mode of the imageView seems to semi correct the issue, but image is still not displaying correctly. I remember learning about the intricacies of how the camera captures a photo and how funny issues can show up, can't exactly remember what though. Anyone have any insight or a good tutorial?
Try to set different background colors on each of the views that are parents to the imageview and see which frame has issues. Also set background color for the imageview itself, maybe the image coming back has empty space inside
You can also use firebase and write a html/php form on your own pc to write data (though+day) to firebase or even in the db itself using Google's interface. Then on the device just make a call to tge table storing the toughts with the current date
Even without the recent changes to Swift, it's a lot simpler. How do you declare which AffineTransform is greater, or which Calendar, or Locale? Lots of types simply have no natural ordering. All of these are Hashable, though.
Hey, do you mind if I’ll ask you some questions too?
Sure go ahead, I‘m probably not the most experienced guy you‘ll find (started my first full time iOS developer job 4 months ago), but I‘ll try my best.
I got very helpful advice from the (unofficial?) Discord Server. You'll find it if you look it up
Same. I’m a beginner to Swift with experience in other programming areas - I find questions tend to lead to other pathways to attaining knowledge. Though I’m still learning myself, I’d be happy to help where I can.
This depends a lot on what app you want to build. I still consider myself a beginner but I have an app on the App Store and sold an app to a company for inventory tracking. They’re both fully developed, finished apps, but not super complex. In addition to that, consider that even though you don’t know right this second how to build a more complex app, that doesn’t mean you can’t learn how to make while making it. So you could start that project now, or soon, and learn as you build. I’m in the middle of Paul Hudson’s 100 Days of Swift and love it. Learning tons. I say check that out.
I started making my first app with no knowledge whatsoever. You learn as you go. Jump right in I say.
Thank you! I will check it out :)
Thank you a lot!!
I made my first app in 2014/2015 when I was 14 or so, I’ve began learning Swift from recommendations on YouTube and learned piece by piece. Eventually I thought why not make an app that could combine all my school web portals (there were many of them) in one app with mostly web views. When I was done it worked quite well and my school noticed, the’ve payed me €400 for something (when I look back now) is basically the most unordered, ‘spaggetified’ projects I’ve ever done. I guess the morale of this story is: Come up with a pretty simple idea (but challenging) for an app and try to make that, release it and maybe even get some feedback. And before you know it after a year or two you have grown some much that your old projects even make you a bit disgusted, but hey that’s not so bad relativity speaking. I think? Probably my longest comment on any subreddit ever lol
Congratulations on your apps! ;) thank you for your comment!
I taught myself by reading the iBooks Swift manual and experimenting with Xcode. My first project was to turn a very useful spreadsheet into an app but I took it down from the App Store within a matter of days as I didn’t want to be known for it. I then built an iPad app with my 7-year old daughter called “Counting and Letters” as a way of introducing her to coding, Swift and general creativity. That one is still up there on the store. I have built another times table app but again removed it from sale as it’s not as good as I’d like...
Just get started with your project on the side while you learn. You can publish it when you’re ready.
I don’t have a MacBook yet (I’m saving up). Am I able to code my app on playground as a rough draft?
You'll never feel confident enough to start building your own app. It takes work to have a starting-point idea and actually start building from scratch. But it has to be done, eventually. Obviously you want to read articles and tutorials, and get a knowledge of using table views and other UI elements, as well as becoming semi-proficient in swift. Repeating that kind of stuff until you're comfortable with it and understand what's going on is crucial. Then, once you have a solid beginner's foundation in iOS and Swift, you're ready to begin. You'll come across issues, and you'll have to find answers for it, and find help if possible. But the value of incrementally adding features to your app; it's invaluable and kind of like documenting your own progress. A portfolio of simple apps (&amp; a solid resume detailing what you've implemented in the apps) is all it takes to get noticed by companies willing to give a junior dev a chance. I have 3 apps, 2 of which have about 1-2 months of constant work, and I just received an offer i'm very happy with this week! There's a ton to learn, so you should feel a rush to learn :) Sorry, this is from the standpoint from the end-goal of obtaining employment as an iOS Engineer. Cheers! Good luck
I ended up adding the \`Fixtures/\` directory for Debug builds in the Xcode config in \`Build Options &gt; Included Source File Name &gt; Debug\`
I learnt by creating my first iOS app. So... immediately, I guess. Obviously I had to rewrite it a few years later because the code was a joke...
you can jump right in but a lot of things are way more difficult than they should be if you have zero prior experience. If you want to learn some coding I would look into html/css and maybe some javascript. Try to build a little website app.
May be you can code on a r/hackintosh Not sure though

How does one get clients? I have always wondered how people seem apps to other people. How to go on about finding clients?
This is the way you do it OP.. otherwise you end up knowing all of the terms and no idea how any of them are used in practice.
+1 to this. You can also consider starting with free Swift starter kits to learn how things are done and try to build on top of those
The one I got was actually a guy I worked for previously. He knew I was getting into development and asked if I could make him an app. From what I’ve heard so far a lot people get jobs like that. Try thinking of apps that could help someone out at their business and pitch them an idea. I’ve worked in craft beer for many years and have a few ideas I’ll eventually build out that could help with different aspects of the business. Hoping I can eventually make one marketable. Upwork is another option but I haven’t had great experience there and I don’t know anyone else that has either. There are so many people willing to do jobs cheaper that to land a job you’ll have to price yourself lower than it’s worth. It’s a race to the bottom in that way.
I released my first app just over a month ago. While I do have experience programming in other languages, iOS has its own quirks and such that have been fun to learn. Between Hacking with Swift and the Ray Wenderlich tutorials, as well as some searching around of course, I figured it out on my own. tl;dr: just dive in, you’ll never get started until you just try 🙂
Thanks for that info. I'm a mobile app dev myself and will definitely checkout those options.
When Flutter preview showed up. 😂
This is the best way to learn any programming language.
When I started learning, it felt impossible to make an entire app with such little knowledge. What I did was followed a course for a few weeks, copying their code and making apps by imitating everything on the video. After a month, maybe two, I started my own app that later evolved and eventually made it to the app store with thousands of downloads. ---- The trick is to start with an app that might benefit you and only you; it doesn't need to be an app for the public just yet. I think "utility" apps, like calculators and information resources, are the easiest types of app to start with as well. I can elaborate to help you come up with an app idea, if necessary. Let me know if I can help in any way.
The thing is, making an app is as simple as new single page app -&gt; run, and then add things as you go
There is no such timing. Just start developing and learn from experience. It's not like learning a theory. It's about making it happened. I would suggest Pluralsight. It's a jump start for beginners just want to "feel" coding and see it actually show your "code" on the screen or devices.
Don't wait until you feel confident to start making an app. Start making an app as soon as you have an idea for an app. And don't wait until you have a good idea, either, making bad apps is a good way to learn.
Thank you!! I appreciate this comment. It all seems so complicated but I’m so excited to try it out. I’m saving up for a MacBook right now, can I still figure out the majority of my app on playgrounds?
Thank you 😊
Thank you!! Is it okay if I message you at some point? I want to make my app but I’m so confusing
Sure, message me any time. I'll help if I can.
Hoooly shit seriously? Thank you so much man the reddit part is actually pretty cool I’ll look into it
What you need is localization. You’ll have to provide all the translations yourself and include them in the Xcode project and app binary. Just search for “swift localization” and you’ll find plenty of tutorials. There are services that will do the translations for you. Even paid APIs
Thank you!!
6 months after I began my second attempt to learn (which was 3 years after my first attempt failed). I read Bif Nerd Ranch’s iOS and Objective C books, then read the Swift book by Apple and I felt I was ready to go.
In the future, you can literally just Google the title of this post. Learning to Google shit is very important. You will get more answers too. 👌
Yes you are right! I’ve been googling a lot of things as well I guess I’m just excited that there is a Reddit group for this and everyone seems so helpful!
Yeah I get it
Late 2009, early 2010, somewhere in between the release of the iPhone 3Gs and the iPhone 4. Needed to switch teams at work due to a reorg, spotted a team doing iOS, and thought "Eh, I already wrote a Mac OS X app for fun in grad school, and it's basically just replacing NS with UI, right?"
This. Books don't really work for me, I need a practical application or else I won't care enough
Maybe try to develop an app that is not too big at first. One that is not the best idea you ever had (maybe the one you are pretty confident will work). The danger is to learn so much things along the way while developing your top app, that you will want to refractor too often, reaching the point where the best way to refractor is to restart from scratch. I made that mistake after one year of intense iOS programming, including 6 month for a company. I started a big project after that, and I learned TDD and the coordinator pattern after.
+1. I just had an idea and went ahead and put together the pieces to do things.
I already knew son basic python and arduino stuff but not that much. As soon as I finished a « course » (like a few YouTube videos) to build a little card playing app, someone close to me asked me if I would like to work with them on a app that tracks some stats they need for they work, today the project is almost a 1.0 and I’m probably going to sell it to them. Jumping right of the bat in a project that has a point, that would even be useful to somebody, is realy motivating and challenging. Tip that helps me a lot: When I have problems, as everybody I search google and go on stack overflow. But there is one YouTube Chanel that teaches you a lot of things, it’s « L’etsBuildThatApp », and this guy started showing up in my YouTube recommendation really often, and so I watch some of his video just for fun or beacouse the title was attractive, and just like this, I end up learning a lot of things that I later implement in my project and that makes my apps fell way better and give me the feeling of doing things correctly, not in a hacky way. (He didn’t pay me)

Hey BooCMB, just a quick heads up: I learnt quite a lot from the bot. Though it's mnemonics are useless, and 'one lot' is it's most useful one, it's just here to help. This is like screaming at someone for trying to rescue kittens, because they annoyed you while doing that. (But really CMB get some quiality mnemonics) I do agree with your idea of holding reddit for hostage by spambots though, while it might be a bit ineffective. Have a nice day!
That’s what I ended up doing, it is pretty good and with an in pact genreator, it feels fast and responsive, thanks for your advice
That’s what I ended up doing, it is pretty good and with an in pact genreator, it feels fast and responsive. Thanks for your advice
No, I decided that downloading the Json as a file and decoding it seems really stupid and a UIactivityIndicatorView with a data task realy make the app feels faster, and with an impact genrator in top, it is perfect. Thank you for your advice
For me, the best way to learn something is to do it, get som examples how other have done it and try to rewrite the code to my use - case. Sometimes you definitely need theories of the language and how things are proper done, but it’s really cool to see first results quite fast. That’s also a + on self motivation to keep going. Just have fun playing with it OP. :)
In reductive terms for a button that acts as both sign in and sign up, how do you in main storyboard make a page for adding user details that only comes up after initial sign up?
It's impossible, give up.
Cool!
I made my first app after learning for 2 months, which was pretty simply written and it had no tab bar controller, no navigation controller, since I didn't know any of those yet. But I still did it and people liked it imho. So if you have an idea(doesn't have to be the greatest idea :D), no matter how new you are, just go ahead and try to implement it. You can also learn more when you work on an application instead of following tutorials all the time.
There’s a concept in programming called [Key-Value Pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute%E2%80%93value_pair) which is a way to structure data so that you have a unique key which allows you to access a value. In iOS development you’ll come across this concept in quite a few places, mainly with Dictionaries. The most common type of Dictionary you’ll come across is probably with a String for both the key and value: Dictionary&lt;String, String&gt; This allows you to create a single object which can contain a whole set of keys and values. It’s worth you looking up how these work because they’re pretty fundamental and you’ll come across them in other languages too, often called a Map/HashMap. In its basic form the key will be a unique String and the second String will be the text actual text you want to use somewhere. The text might be something the user entered and you’ll have no way of knowing what that might be, but the key you’ll know because you’ll define it in code. When making an app in multiple languages we have to set the text on labels and buttons all the time. If we had a button that was to say “Press Me” we would just set the text to that effect when we create the button. But in multiple languages we want to still be able to set the text of the button when the text will differ depending on the device language. The Localisation of any software project, not just iOS, relies heavily on the key-value pair concept to use a key to access the text in the current language. The .strings file allows us to do that pretty easily. It contains a text file for each language with a set of key-value pairs where the keys all match. Language en_GB: “press_me” = “Press Me”; “error_message” = “Something went wrong, we’re trying to fit it.”; Language de_DE: “press_me” = “Drück Mich”; “error_message” = “Etwas ist falsch gelaufen, wir sind dabei es zu reparieren.”; In this format the text in “s before the = is the key and the text after is the value. The keys must be identical in each language but the values are very different. It’s quite typical for the keys in localisations to be in the format of all lowercase and with underscores between each word, this is a form of [Snake Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case). It’s not always in this format though. Now in iOS, to access this text we initialise a String using the [NSLocalizedString](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nslocalizedstring) macro. The simplest form of this is: NSLocalizedString(key, comment) e.g.: let buttonText = NSLocalizedString(“press_me”, comment: “”) // The comment isn’t important here If you create your String and pass the key you created in your .strings file, the correct version of the value will be returned for you based on the device language. So if your phone in in English - Great Britain, buttonText will contain “Press Me”, and if in German it will contain “Drück Mich”. This is handled for you automatically. Note: You will have a base language that will be the default returned when the user’s device is in a language that’s not supported. Note: If you pass a key which doesn’t exist, the key itself will be returned in the String, e.g. let buttonText = NSLocalizedString(“tap_me”, comment: “”) // contains “tap_me” When you create your project you need to manage your Strings files closely. Unlike with Android and other platforms, if you try and access a key that doesn’t exist, you won’t know about it until you see the wrong text actually displayed in the app, this is easy to miss. It’s not uncommon for bugs like this to appear on /r/softwaregore. I can highly recommend using external software for managing your text. I use [Loco](https://localise.biz/) on most projects. It’s cheap but very effective. There’s a learning curve with it but it’s worth the effort. The developer normally personally replies to support emails within a couple of hours too.
So, you provide less information, I will glad to see more, but for now I think that you have problem because first you are popping view controller from the navigation controller, and then you dismissing current controller, I don’t know your vc structure but problem may cause there. Try to found problem with commenting one of the following lines. P.S.: don’t use hardcoded animated state in viewDidAppear (or simmilar methods) postpone it like override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) { super.viewDidAppear(animated) // your code }
https://developer.apple.com/internationalization/
Why is this animation "instantaneous"? It works I know because if I try to rotate less than a full circle, it shows. But it's immediate, not a rotation across 2 seconds as I expected. func loadQuestion(question: SingleQuestion) { GlyphLabel.text = question.theSkill.glyph nextQuestion += 1 QuestionCounter.text = String(nextQuestion) let angle = Double.pi UIView.animate(withDuration: 2.0, delay: 0, options: [], animations: { self.GlyphLabel.transform = self.GlyphLabel.transform.rotated(by: CGFloat(angle * 2.0)) }, completion: nil) }
You may need to rephrase that question to get an answer. It doesn't really make sense
This actually seems so much easier than I was expecting it to be. Both as a question this and as a reminder to myself to lest later… While I'm sure it may become cumbersome, could you make the key / language pairs (press\_me, en\_GB, de\_DE, en\_US) and assign all your localizations that way ensuring that you do have a localized version for that string? Theres a bit more that probably has to happen (maybe the precompile stage generates new localization files automagically)... &amp;#x200B; I know I haven't thought this through very much, and I'm sure there are some good reasons why this is probably not terribly efficient, but again, this was just some prelim thoughts I had.
Lots of ways to accomplish what you want. In most basic terms you are going to want to build a backend API that handles all the data for the game, you can do this a variety of ways, like building it entirely yourself using Python/Flask and a database like PostgreSQL (this is how I do things, but you have to know a bunch of backend server stuff) or allegedly services like Firebase will do all the heavy lifting of server setup for you, but I don’t know how that stuff works really. Some advice... when it comes to server setup and how to build your own API, a tutorial from 2011 might not be “out of date”. You also say something about some stuff not being what you want, but I suggest you may not know what you want yet, since at the moment you don’t know what you don’t know. Building and running a server and an iOS app on top of it is an ambitious project and to do it properly requires learning a lot of different skills and technologies. If you wanna build your own backend, here’s the first of 1000 steps: https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-start-building-a-backend-for-your-ios-app-w Good luck!
Thank you so much! This will be a lot of help since I now know what to google if needed. As for that 2011 tutorial it didn’t have everything I wanted but was close. I know the basics of what I want since that tutorial was for connecting two players and I would like to have a larger server. Thanks again!
In addition to staire’s option, which is definitely the more sophisticated and customizable option, you can use a server hoster like google’s firebase. Its very modern and they do all the confusing stuff for you and you just write the api call functions. It would be much easier if you’ve never done this sort of stuff, however you may run into a wall if you want a feature that can’t be achieved through firebase.
After I made my second app. There’s so much you’ll only learn with experience. Just get through it and don’t fret about doing things the wrong way. With practice you’ll learn what works for you.
Wanderlust
Awesome, I have a project that this would be perfect for. Plus, I was looking to replace Rainbow as it has several shortcomings that's have been bothering me for a while
I don’t 100% understand what you’re asking but you could certainly build you own localisation mechanism to have it work however you like, but the default iOS way is as I have described.
I think I see what you’re saying. So, you’ve got a tableview controller that you’ve embedded in a navigation controller, correct? If that’s the case, then, no, you don’t have to have a new file specifically for your outlets. That being said, you’ll need a viewcontroller file for your tableview controller. Put your outlets in that viewcontroller file. Boom, Swifted!
Alright so with firebase and other similar applications I’ve read some issues. Not sure if this is true but staires link said that applications like this are untrustworthy since they could shut down at any time. I might just put in the work to make my own. I’ll check it out though, thanks!
yeah. I also have a FeedVC.swift file for the link between my login/register page (first page) and the table view controller via the navigation controller. I thought to add the IB outlet there because the sign out code back to the first page is there.
Yes they can shutdown at anytime. It has happened to me once but to be fair it can happen on any server - its just that you would have to rely on their repair team instead of yours. That being said if you have the motivation and patience to build the server on your own i think it will be well worth your time because it will be: More customizable In your direct control for crashes etc. When complete you will know how your server works, instead of relying on a magic black box you can’t look into
staires'* opinion &gt; Its very modern It's* very modern
&gt; but staires link staires'* link
&gt; shutdown shut down*
Well, you add the outlets for each page on their corresponding view controller. So add your outlets for the login to the login VC, and the ones for the table view on the tableview VC. If you don’t have a tableview VC, add one. :-)
that makes sense thanks. :) The sign out that I have is in the feedVC so that one should then be the table VC just named feed VC. lol I am pretty new to Xcode, it's a bit different than R.
Same here. I started with an idea and gained knowledge through forums, research and tutorials as I went. Then, by the time you start your second application, you will be surprised at what you know how to do and how much sense it makes.
I think that the best way for you to learn is to jump right into building an app. You don't need to publish it, but at least make it. If you have an idea for an app you want to make and publish, there are two ways you can approach it. The first is to jump right into that. The pros are that you'll be highly motivated, and you won't struggle finding for an idea. The con is that in the long term, your beginner-level code might come back to bite you. But you can always go back and fix it. The second is to find another project to start. The pro is that you can hack and experiment freely, knowing you'll toss it when you're done. You will learn things that you can later put to use in your publishable app, and you'll know how to better make them. The con is that you need to think of something (it doesn't need to be something good, so it shouldn't be too hard).
Sure.
You would use Firebase Authentication in conjunction with Firestore.
I don’t think you’re suppose to constrain the content view to the scroll view edges. The content view should have a width constraint instead of a leading/trailing.
According to Xcode, &amp;#x200B; &gt;the scrollable size of a uiscrollview is computed automatically based upon the constraints of its subviews. in order to fully define the scrollable content width and height, there needs to be constraints touching all edges (leading, trailing, top, and bottom) of the scroll view.
A properly setup subview should be constrained to a scroll view with leading, trailing, top, and bottom. You then also want to constrain the width if vertically scrollable or constrain the height if horizontally scrollable.
I have all those constraints in place, and when I set the content size and the frame size, I am able to scroll the correct amount, but the content which is based off the bounds never shows up because the bounds are size zero.
If you have these setup, you should never have to set frame, content size, or bounds
The scrollable size is determined at runtime (and eventually will be changing dynamically as well - one thing at a time). I set a intrinsic size placeholder, so initially the view size is zero, but once I can calculate the size, I set it. This is a standard approach.
If you’re going to take this approach, I think you’d need to call invalidateIntrinsicSize when your content loads, but I would think a more standard approach would be to set your constraints in a fashion where the constraints determine your intrinsic size dynamically.
Could you share with us what is the part of Rainbow that is bothering you? Perhaps we could learn something from you. TIA.
Yes the scroll view should be constrained to the supervise and be auto calculated. Your content view inside the scroll view should have a set width.
I’m a long time server/database developer, just learning iOS programming. If I were doing this project, I would start with the database. My choice would be MySQL if you need to keep the server costs cheap, or MSSQL if you can afford it. Then, you need server side code to handle API calls that do everything from login tasks (request new, password reset, lock out after x attempts, log in, etc.), adding/selecting/updating configuration options, and then the calls you need to actually do your gameplay. Just because I’m used to it (I started web development a long time ago), I use PHP for my API, but I force myself to have the discipline to keep it in a current format. That means segregating the functionally into separate classes (for sure one for user/login handling and at least one to separate database statements to start). That’s the kind of code you can use over and over again. If you’re interested in using PHP, let me know, and I can send you a github link to look at. This sounds like a lot of fun. Keep us posted!
Alright here’s the part where I ask questions since I’m confused. I’m all for everything you suggested since I think it’s exactly what I imagined and want. Now I’ve heard of the api and such and that was more of what I was envisioning. What does the MySQL do? I know you said that it was a database so I would assume that it hold all the users data. Is it possible to do such a thing on my own without using a (what I assume is) a third party tool? Thanks for that help though as this definitely will be helpful later on!
Just make sure you store passwords properly. Below is a good start. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49343283/is-storing-users-passwords-in-firebasedatabase-is-a-good-idea Key point, users will reuse the same username and password on multiple sites. So if your site is hacked, you might allow access to other sites on the internet.
\&gt; It's tripled the time it would have taken me to build what I'm trying otherwise Yep, sounds like Cocoapods
I fucking hate Cocoapods. We had so many problems with it at one of my previous jobs, and instead of ditching it for Carthage altogether, my company *gave money* to the CP foundation to help them improve things. Have you noticed it get better since 2016? Me, neither.
Would have been nice to know what operating system it was about, before reading 3/4 of the question.
Gotta be honest. I hate Carthage just about as much. How hard is it to a) do your job as a developer instead of reaching for the first library to do what you refuse to try to understand, and/or b) add a framework to your project manually?
Thanks, I was able to root cause it. I was creating the view in the storyboard. I thought maybe it had something to do with the translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints var. Turns out, the documentation on that var specifies that it is set to true for programmatically created views and false for storyboard created views, but I was trying to manage my storyboard view outside of the constraint world. Setting it to true helped, but there were still some constraints causing conflicts. Replacing the frame setup with constraints as you suggested seemed to fix the issue. If I created the view programmatically, I should be able to use the frame code as well. It was pretty obscure but I am glad I was able to figure it out. &amp;#x200B; I feel like if you specify a placeholder for an intrinsic size in interface builder, translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints should default to true, since you will be expected to manage the size programmatically, I think that is what threw me off.
In your first point, are you arguing against using 3rd-party dependencies? Why would I _reimplement_ something that's been done before and is used, tested, and _maintained_ by others? I know full well how to do OAuth authentication, for example, but that doesn't mean I want to write my own when OAuthSwift can do it for me. To your second point, again, I don't see the point of 1) downloading a specific version from the project's GitHub release page; 2) unzipping it; 3) building it manually; and 4) adding it to my project, when something like Carthage can do all of that for me. What I like about Carthage is that that's _all_ it does. It doesn't force me to use a workspace that it generates, and it sure as fuck doesn't rewrite the dependencies' project files, flattening file hierarchies, clobbering resource files, etc. Cocoapods is _still_ an absolute nightmare when trying to localize a project.
Very cool, but some feedback regarding Swift naming conventions: you should use more prepositions. \`'text'.blue\` should probably be \`'text'.asBlue\` and \`'text'.foreColor(196)\` would be \`'text'.withForeColor(196)\`. And another thing: it would be great if you overrode these functions to also support enum arguments, so you could do \`.withForeColor(.blue)\`. But all around nice work!
Sure there are two main issues I have: 1. The various clear functions (clearStyles, clearColors, etc.) Don't actually remove styles, but instead set them to perceived defaults. This meant I had to write my own funcion for 2. Measuring string size for display in the terminal is very difficult without removing and readding styles. This makes it difficult to create fixed width output like tables. I'd say that Rainbow is definitely an example of "doing one thing well", but my first point has been an open issue for a while. Arguably my second point falls outside the remit of Rainbow but then it significantly limits the usefulness of the library. Hope that helps and I look forward to trying out ANSITerminal soon!
Thank you. Very nice suggestions, especially the `as` and `with` prefix for foreground color. I'll consider it. About enum for 256 colors. Honestly, I don't think it would have any benefits. The "standard" names are not very good anyway. They're inconsistent and still using number (green1, red2, etc). So, I prefer to just simply use the number. However, if you could provide a better and consistent names for them, simply send me a pull request. I'll be happy to accept it. ;)
Regarding your issues, here's my response: 1. What do you mean by "perceived defaults"? ANSI has default code for color and styles. Using the default code would bring the default color (39 and 49) and style (0) to the terminal. I see Rainbow also uses the same default code. 2. Of course, because color or style does add invisible string to the text. You should calculate the original text *before* adding color or style, not *after* it. That's what ANSITerminal is doing too. There's no other way because it's the way ANSI works. It's like HTML tags. Do you have a better solution for the problems? I'll consider it if it's good enough. Thank you.
The solution to problem \#1 *is* the solution to problem \#2. I added a method that strips the styles rather than setting them to defaults. To call a method "clearColor" is misleading when it actually sets a different colour code. Also I disagree on \#2 as I've used my solution to \#1 to be able to calculate accurate string width on the fly without having to maintain two strings. Passing two strings around for the sake of styling is a messy and undesirable pattern when creating a new string with colors stripped is trivial.
I see. That's why ANSITerminal doesn't use "clear" but "default" because clear color means nothing. There's nothing that has no color. Even if you stripe all the ANSI attributes, your text still does have a color, the default color (of the terminal). It's just semantic. I'd love to see your solution for problem #2. Do you make a function that strips all the ANSI attributes string from the text? So far, I don't need to maintain two strings. I simply put the color and style into the text only when I need to display it.
Would you please submit your suggestion as an issue on GitHub? I'm afraid I'm going to forget it. I'm now doing something else.
&gt;I see. That's why ANSITerminal doesn't use "clear" but "default" because clear color means nothing. There's nothing that has no color. Even if you stripe all the ANSI attributes, your text still does have a color, the default color (of the terminal). It's just semantic. Ah I see! I wasn't aware of that so I guess it makes sense. Also 'default' is a far more sensible naming convention. &gt;I'd love to see your solution for problem #2. Do you make a function that strips all the ANSI attributes string from the text? So far, I don't need to maintain two strings. I simply put the color and style into the text only when I need to display it. Yes, I'm on mobile now but I can post it later The problem occurs when you are, for example, writing a columnised table to the terminal. You want to be able to provide a structure of strings up front so they can be displayed on request. I don't necessarily want the table building class, or the caller, to have to know about styling choices for those strings that may have been made further back in the call stack or at some other point in time. My solution may not be the purest architecturally, but it does mean that various areas of my code dealing with strings and their widths do not need to be concerned with width inconsistencies caused by color/style codes (except within the string domain itself, like the zero-width space).
About problem #1. My mistake, default color isn't set by striping all the ANSI attributes because ANSI attributes is also a state. Once you set it, the terminal will use it until it's changed to another attribute. For example, once you set text color to yellow, the next text will still be yellow, even if it has no ANSI attributes attached. That mechanims is provided by ANSITerminal through `setColor()` function. About problem #2. Thank you, I'd love to see your real case and solution. It'd be very valuable for ANSITerminal to provide better solution. To this point, I think the only possible solution is providing a function to strip all ANSI attributes from a text. Say, a function named `stripAttributes() → String`. Do you think that's enough?

I don’t think you’re going to want to try to build out your own database engine. You have to be able to handle hundreds or thousands of simultaneous connections and need indexing and parallelism that is already built out and well tested and supported. I bet AWS has MySQL on a free tier that you could spin up and try.
Okay I’ll be sure to check that out to see if I like it and I’ll consider paying later down the line. Thanks so much!
I've been googling around for a while and haven't found an answer, which I'm sure will be forehead-slappingly obvious once someone knowledgeable tells me, here it is: I have a file in MyProject/Sources/moduleName/Blah.swift, containing just one function called sayHello. I want to test this function, I created MyProject/Tests/moduleName/BlahTests.swift, that has final class BlahTests: XCTestCase { func testSayHello() } that, er, calls sayHello. I can't get past two errors, either: "sayHello is unavailable in Swift" if I don't import Blah, or if I import Blah, No such module "Blah". What am I missing here? There's no class, there's no struct, I just have one function in Blah.swift I want to test. All tutorials I've found always add some class, some struct, and add all ios stuff, while I just want to do this one simple thing. Any hint/pointer would be much appreciated. Thank you!
Sounds like you’re using Real-time Database? You might want to look into switching to Firestore if you’re still only just getting started. In my experience it’s easier and less “messy” than rtdb. The documentation should be all you need to get done what you’re trying to do. Also, your struct properties should be let instead of var, unless you’re intending to mutate them for some reason. Also you’re naming of arrays is redundant, leave off “arrayOf”.
Interesting...I’ll check that out today!
good luck!
From my hazy memory of my use of Firebase: You use childAdded, childChanged, childRemoved together. ChildAdded will download the entire database at the start (with each entry calling your callback function that is in childAdded) and whenever there are new additions. ChildChanged will be called whenever something changes. ChildRemoved will be called whenever something is deleted. So if you have a real time database like the following: `/store/&lt;random-number-inserted-by-firebase-1&gt;/name/store-1` `/store/&lt;random-number-inserted-by-firebase-1&gt;/location/street-1` `/store/&lt;random-number-inserted-by-firebase-1&gt;/items/0/name/name-1` `/store/&lt;random-number-inserted-by-firebase-1&gt;/items/0/type/type-1` `/store/&lt;random-number-inserted-by-firebase-1&gt;/items/1/name/name-2` `/store/&lt;random-number-inserted-by-firebase-1&gt;/items/1/type/type-2` `/store/&lt;random-number-inserted-by-firebase-2&gt;/name/store-2` `/store/&lt;random-number-inserted-by-firebase-2&gt;/location/street-2` You start the childAdded, childChanged, and childRemoved observers on "/store" together. Your childAdded callback function will be called twice with a dictionary like `["random-number-inserted-by-firebase-1": ["name": "store-1", "location": "street-1", "items": [["name": "name-1", "type": "type-1"], ["name": "name-2", "type": "type-2"]]` in your snapshot value. This function will continue to operate in the background until you stop it. You should convert this dictionary into your database structures and store them (perhaps in an array). If you add another entry, your childAdded callback will get another call. If you change `/store/&lt;random-number-inserted-by-firebase-1&gt;/items/0/type/type-1` to `/store/&lt;random-number-inserted-by-firebase-1&gt;/items/0/type/new-type-1` your childChanged callback function will receive a dictionary `["random-number-inserted-by-firebase-1": ["name": "store-1", "location": "street-1", "items": [["name": "name-1", "type": "new-type-1"], ["name": "name-2", "type": "type-2"]]` in your snapshot value. Your should convert this value into your data structure and then modify where you stored the other values. If you delete an entry, your childRemoved callback function will receive a dictionary. This one I'm rather hazy since it's been a few years since I've used Firebase RTD. I think the snapshot has a ref which points to the structure which was deleted. So if you delete `/store/&lt;random-number-inserted-by-firebase-1&gt;`, this value will show up in the reference. You can then find the identical data structure in your array and then remove it. The `&lt;random-number-inserted-by-firebase-1&gt;` is the unique id given Firebase when you add entries via childByAutoId. I would add an id field to your struct so that you can find the modified or deleted entry. It's been a while since I used FBRTD so pardon me if the description I wrote above isn't accurate.
Thanks for this info! Are you using an alternative now?
I'm using postgresql hosted on Google now (It's a company decision, not mine). The main issue I have is that it's hard to find things. If I wanted to search for entries which match more than one criteria, I would have to do this in code, in stages. For example, if I wanted to search for groceryStore with more than 5 items in the list, I would have to do the filtering in my own code (download all the entires and manually check the length of the items array). Also if you have two platforms (android + iOS) you would need to make sure both clients use the same algorithm or have a server front end storing the data on firebase.
Interesting; thanks!
The most obvious challenge is that Swift string ranges and NSString ranges are completely different animals.
Even though you use a real time database you sound like you want to download data once. Use this https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/ios/read-and-write
Thanks! Would the best practice to keep updating user changes to use .childChanged from then on?
[Blend2D](https://blend2d.com) is an upcoming rasterization library that has been showing some very promising results in some initial benchmarks. It leverages SIMD instructions and employs a built-in JIT compiler for faster rendering pipelines. The API is built with C, but I thought having a nice wrapper library that is more Swift idiomatic would be a nice touch. Currently it only works on macOS and Linux, however.
Is there a swift learning discord channel? Where we can ask more experienced people questions in live time
Did you set the table’s data source connection in the xib?
Are you sure your build is failing and it's not just a leftover inline error? Xcode does this to me a lot where it will show the "No such module" error in the UI but the build will succeed, as it finds the module once it's built. Sometimes the UI error doesn't go away until I switch files.
How does this compare to UIKit's rasterization performance or features? Or are you interested in this as a cross-platform rasterization library?
Initially, I'm only concerned with cross-platform support so far and haven't looked into iOS integration, mainly because it uses a JIT and I'm not sure how well that plays out in iOS' sandboxed environment.
It's a little tricky to guess what might be wrong. You appear to be using Interface Builder, but haven't included any of the relevant files for that. You didn't include the entire definition of this class. You don't say what you tried, or what data you're using, or what you saw in the debugger. - You define a mapping of row number to row object, but the definition is private. Is this method getting called? Does it even compile? It seems like something that would at least get flagged as a warning. - You don't define the mapping of (`Objects` value, column number) to cells here. What data are you expecting to see in your table? What columns are there? How do you identify them? The typical ingredients of a problem are: (1) what you did, (2) what happened, and (3) what you expected to see. I see about half of part 1 here.
ObserverSingleEvent is used when you want to get the value of something once and don't care about updates, deletes, changes. It automatically removes itself.
When I first read about CocoaPods, it seemed like a lousy architecture which would cause needless trouble. In the years since then, I've seen countless people complaining about exactly the sort of problems I expected. Posts like this are great, because they reaffirm my world view. Apparently I do understand well enough to anticipate how systems will fail. The only part I don't understand is why anyone would use CocoaPods.
I’m a relative novice to swift development and use cocoa pods because it’s recommended in so many tutorials and seems to be pushed by the frameworks themselves as the preferred method. If you have the time would you be able to share whether it’s cocoapods specifically or do you think Carthage is trouble as well? What’s your preferred method of integration and any resources where a novice could find out more?
Carthage is WYSIWYG, you just need a shared scheme to use it, all it does is archive the framework in all architectures (or just downloads them if they are available) and has a copy-frameworks script that removes the simulator architectures when archiving your app, so you can upload it to the app store. &amp;#x200B; Cocoapods uses a completely different "spec file" and rebuilds the 3rd party project and also modifies your own project file, sometimes fucking it up.
I switch my scheme, then build, then switch back and build it again. That works until I change ANYTHING sometimes. Or other times I can work all day and it stays working. But I think I installed it right Bc it worked for like a week after I installed it. I wish it was an error like you said, but that error always makes my build fail. :-/
This is how I have set up our system: the mobile apps read data from firestore. When the client wants to perform an action that would change data, those requests go through firebase's cloud functions. This way the database is only manipulated by the cloud functions backend, and not by the clients directly, making it much easier to write security rules for firestore (reads are allowed by authenticated users for their own user account data, writes are only triggered from the backend). For simple tasks, you could allow some specific fields to be directly updated by the client to avoid the overhead of HTTP requests
Databases from Firebase are made to be consumed by the client directly, mobile or web. The idea is that you don't need to manage/develop an architecture (backend mostly) to deal with your needs. The only advantage with your approach, if I can see any, would be getting ready to replace Firebase and even then it could be wasted effort.
First up: I don't use Firebase/Firestore. I use old school relational databases like Postgres, SQL Server, and MySql. So keep that in mind, this might not apply. I would never allow my app to talk directly to the database, as I do not want ANY exposed connections to the database at all (except via VPN). It is a HUGE security risk. You are essentially exposing connection strings. Not to mention having to construct queries in you app code. I don't want to think about how to do a table migration in that setup since you can't control how fast people update their apps. Also, it is easier to performance tune you database queries from a backend situation (could be stockholm syndrome here, but this is how I've done it for 15 - 20 years, so I'm used to it). So, all of my traffic goes thru an https endpoints all the time. My backend technology of choice for this is [Asp.net](https://Asp.net) MVC using C#, but can easily be accomplished with Node, Ruby, ... or any other mature web framework.
This is the way to do it if you're not using Firebase. but firebase allows you do things directly to the Firestore which eliminates the need to run an http server with a database and some app that encapsulates query building. Its just a completely different architecture so while you would never allow your app to talk directly to a DB, and thats fine, its not the way you do it with Firebase/Firestore.
This, use firebase functions to handle everything, from reading to writing to firestore.
Firestore / Firebase Realtime DB are meant to connect directly to your mobile app, so the traditional wisdom of "your client shouldn't interact with the database directly" is mostly wrong. Instead, both Firebase products have security rules (here are links for [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/overview) and [Realtime DB](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security)) that you're supposed to set up to ensure that clients are only reading / writing the data that they should be. I think there *is* a problem with making HTTP requests to a server in this particular instance. Firestore and Realtime DB are meant to be realtime solutions, meaning that the client doesn't refresh or re-request data when the app is running, it just "magically" receives updates from the server. If you make HTTP requests, you lose this functionality, and you'd have to replicate it yourself using sockets, but I think that's all more work than it's worth. Properly defined security rules should solve the problem. The senior dev's comment on Swift being a "safe/server language" is kinda senseless. Swift is a safe language in the sense that it's statically typed, has memory safety, optionals, etc. and it's also a server language in the sense that you can build web backends with it, but that has little to nothing to do with whether or not Swift code should connect directly to a database. If your app's database was, for example, a PostgreSQL instance, it would be a **horrible** idea to let the app connect to it directly, and Swift's memory safety and applicability as a server side language have nothing to do with that. It's just plain bad practice to let clients have unrestricted access to the database, regardless of the language the clients are built with.
I personally don't like this approach. Yes. you can control what your functions do specifically, but since the firebase cloud functions are at the admin permission level, you have no control with firebase security rules.
In my opinion, the App should write/read directly from the database. Everything you are worried about the app being able to do, or not do should be handled with firebase security rules.
The Firebase SDK is basically already doing for you what you’re proposing. You’re not writing directly to the database, far from it.
Have you considered using FireStore instead? Also, don't forget to put security rules in the Json script for your database.
Old ways needs to change.
I've been learning Swift for some months and iOS development. I like the language, but it seems very fixated at iOS/Mac app development.. &amp;#x200B; Can I use Swift outside of Xcode? example if I wanted to create a terminal script/software to automate some tasks. Is there some tutorials on how?
There can be. Some Obj-C libraries make heavy use of macros which can’t import into swift and you start making lots of wrapper logic. Really depends on the library and how much they care to support Swift interop out of the box. I say give it a go! If you find it’s too much work switch over to Obj-C
It all depends on the use case of your application. Firebase/Firestore have real-time listeners that are essentially like websockets that can be used to observe and reflect changes to the state of your app based on database changes. This can be really useful and talking directly to the database layer has very little drawbacks in that sense. Now when it comes to persisting and sanitizing data to your database that does not require any real-time or observer patterns, you should most definitely use an API layer. Here are the benefits: Queries are not hard coded into the application so it’s easier to control multiple production instances of the app with different versions. People aren’t always going to update the app. You are no longer tied to Firebase as your DB layer. This is very important because with an API layer you can migrate your database to Firestore relatively easy. If you had hard coded queries, then you would have to manage the versioning of your app to make sure you don’t have old versions of the app that will push bad/deprecated data into your database. For a project of mine, the product owner wanted to migrate to Firestore so it’s definitely a valid reason. Another big reason is to minimize code duplication. Think of all the duplicate code logic you’ll have to create for both an Android and iOS app. If you had an API layer, you could simply hit the endpoint using a Networking Layer and save yourself a lot of engineering time. These are just some of the reasons why I would move away from the Firebase/Firestore SDK for networking logic in favor of creating an API via Cloud functions.
One trick that can help in the situation where macros are used is to wrap the obj-c components into a static library, then write simple Swift adapter interface.
Nice writeup, couple comments. 1. using a private var with computed property interface to it is sometimes the only way to solve certain problems. So to say it is a useless construct is inaccurate. More accurate to say it is rarely needed. 2. Swift does not rely on Obj-C for providing KVO on stored properties. It provides this behavior on it’s own, even though it might be inspired by Obj-C (and therefore Smalltalk, where this pattern first appeared.)
I think most of my opinions have already been stated well here; it sounds like your current setup is fine. Firebase isn't just a database, it's a platform. So if you're using the Firebase iOS library to connect to your firestore/rtdb, this is not the same thing as having a direct connection to a traditional database. Just make sure you're using Firebase Auth, and set your access rules appropriately in the DB. If your company has chosen Firebase for its real-time features, you definitely don't want to add another layer in between. &amp;#x200B; I did have one app that used Firebase where we were planning on adding an API between the mobile apps and Firebase, but this was for pretty specific reasons. Our app had grown over a couple years, and we started integrating other services. We had a SQL database and used S3 on AWS, OneSignal for push, and integrated with third party API's. The iOS app held all the business logic to integrate these services, and we weren't using the real-time features of the RTDB. I left before we finished moving all of this logic to a single endpoint, but I think that abstracting our Firebase DB to the server was the right choice in that situation. Looking back of course, I would have just suggested to use AWS for noSQL, SQL, push, etc. in the first place, as this was just a case of poor planning/architecture.
Things for me fall faster than they should. Idk why, I think I’m just an idiot.
Mostly not really. It kind of is the only way to go. Where there are shortcomings, you can write your own methods to ya doe the limitations.
It’s missing your custom [NSTableCellView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstablecellview) where you observe on didSet, so you can tell it how to interpret your `Object` struct and apply the image to the image view. A lot of the trouble you may run into when switching from iOS to macOS table views is understanding how they are the same at the core. What might be throwing you off, is that NSTableView in AppKit is optimized for CoreData bindings. But underneath all that, they essentially work the same way as their CocoaTouch cousin, just offer quite a bit more: more features, more seeming complexity. But they really aren’t any more complex when you’re already used to doing everything manually such as the case in iOS.
2018 15in MBP with 32gb of RAM and 1tb storage. It's honestly significant overkill. Any mac from 2015-16 will service you well! I'm honestly considering buying a 12inch macbook when they make the next release since I prefer portability over power. I would recommend one of the newer mac mini's with the lowest ram configuration because you can upgrade it for really cheap after the fact.
i have a 2.8 i7 from 2014 and it still feels like new.
Ahh the 2014, such a great year! Still rue the day my company made me send mine back to trade in. They lease everything and wouldn’t let me buy it out for $400. Now I’m on a 2017 MBP with 16gb RAM and 512gb SSD. More than adequate for most tasks but does start to sweat a bit if I’m doing Visual Studio in Parallels and Xcode at the same time. Also you’d be surprised how fast you can burn through 512gb when you are running a bunch of VMs. Anyway for straight Xcode you’ll be fine with any recent MacBook or SSD desktop. Don’t do HD macs.
Perhaps the engine is frame-orientated, so when fps goes up, the game speeds up without giving you the clue. You are definitely smarter than a lot of people by showing that you can make games.
I have the mBP 2017 with the upgraded gfx card. (Work provided) &amp;#x200B; I said it was to develop more visual apps. It's really so I can game on it too &lt;\_&lt;
Thanks! 1. Do you have some examples you can think of? I've written similar patterns when I've needed to do some kind of data type massaging, but then that's a different case (although similar), because the stored and computed properties have different types. 2. "KVO on stored properties" Are you referring to [Property Observers](https://nshipster.com/swift-property-observers/) (`willSet` / `didSet`)?
My game hardly works lol. However, Swift’s frame counter says 60fps constant. I think there’s a gravity function, I’ll try it. If it works, I will put it here.
1. Well, one such example might be to expose a mutable var as an immutable one. Or when overriding a property in some cases. Sometimes used to create simple semaphores around properties using dispatch queues, etc. 2. Sorry, I might just be misunderstanding your bullet point “2”..?
My 2012 Mac mini is not able to update to the latest version of Android. I'd say stay away from that year. Like mentioned above get a new Mac mini it's what I'll be doing as well. I have a 2018 MacBook air with 8 gigs of RAM and it works great.
1. &gt; Well, one such example might be to expose a mutable var as an immutable one. [Per my post](https://github.com/amomchilov/Blog/blob/master/Stop%20writing%20getters%20and%20setters%20in%20Swift.md#but-what-if-i-want-a-private-setter), that's already possible ``` Swift struct S { public var publicMutableProperty: Int = 0 public private(set) var publicPrivatelyMutableProperty = 0 } var s = S() s.publicMutableProperty += 1 s.publicPrivatelyMutableProperty += 1 // ❌ error: left side of mutating operator isn't mutable: 'publicPrivateMutableProperty' setter is inaccessible ``` &gt; Sometimes used to create simple semaphores around properties using dispatch queues, etc. Ah yes, that's a decent example. Though to rawly use dispatch queues like that is probably a really bad design. It'd be much better to wrap it into a an [`Atomic` wrapper](https://www.objc.io/blog/2019/01/15/atomic-variables-part-2/), that contains that logic. One example I can think of is: ``` Swift struct S { // An Observable&lt;Int&gt; that alerts you of any changes let _i: Variable&lt;Int&gt; = ... // Get the current value var i: Int { return _i.value } } ``` Even still though, I think this is sufficiently different from the example I gave, to warrant keeping my statement as-is. However, I think I should do a better job of making clear that what I'm reffering to isn't the identifier pairs (`_i`/`i`), but rather, the "passthrough-ness" of how neither the setter or the getter do anything besides pass on the get/set to another getter/setter. Do you have an idea of how I can express that effectively? (FYI patterns like this one motivated [the idea of "property delegates"](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-2-property-delegates-by-custom-attributes/22855)). 2. In your prior comment you said: &gt; Swift does not rely on Obj-C for providing KVO on stored properties. It provides this behavior on it’s own I was asking what you meant by "KVO on stored properties", and if you were referring to Swift's [Property Observers](https://nshipster.com/swift-property-observers/)? What exactly did you have in mind with this comment? I didn't mention KVO or ObjC, so I'm failing to see the connection (or maybe I just need some sleep).
7yr iOS dev, use 2012 macbook pro 15" at home, 8Gb ram, 256gb hd. Suits my needs and runs the latest OS. I have a new 15" at work.
Same as this but with 16gb ram and 256 ssd. Works great!
MBP 15" 2014 Mid, 16/256 - works great!
Mac Mini, base model.
Taking advantage of this thread, how happy will I be with this Mac Mini - 3.0GHz 6‑core, 16GB, 512GB SSD Right now I'm using my mid-2010 MBP
You need to set the target of the button but you don’t need to create a back button, the uinavigation controller does it automatically when you push.
Macbook Pro 2012 16GB Ram 1TB hard drive I don’t see the point of upgrading as I’m not that skilled at Swift yet, and the Macbook still works great, just takes a while for xCode to open a project.
iMac pro, but thats not only for programming of course
Why though? Have you tried it? I did. And I think it fucking sucks ass. Just as much as debugging instruments in general in the latest updates, for me personally, but definitely not “better” in any way.
&gt; The patch notes states that it's better and faster. Well it can't be worse, can it?
Yep, it's clearly faster for me. Sucks ass seems a bit strong, why do you hate a tool that's faster and provides more info?
in a world of butterfly keyboards we can never know for sure...
I'm making a project for school, where I create an app for students to order online from the canteen. The student selects a product by turning the switch on, they can turn on as many switches as they want. after they have chosen their products I want the total price to be shown on a label. I am struggling to do this because I can't find anywhere online where I can set a value to my switches and have them add up into a label. Someone, please help!
Well, faster yes. But better? Even for something like a simple dictionary from a JSON it does this: &amp;#x200B; \`\`\` \[0\] = { key = "name" value = { payload\_data\_0 = &lt;extracting data from value failed&gt; payload\_data\_1 = 0x0000000000000000 payload\_data\_2 = 0x00000001158b86f0 @"UIView-rightMargin-guide-constraint" instance\_type = 0x000000010c534c88 } } \`\`\` &amp;#x200B; I mean... what? \`key ="name"\` is the only useful info. I have no idea where \`"UIView-rightMargin-guide-constraint"\` comes from since that's not in the JSON at all.
If you have multiple client types (iOS, Android, web), you should go through a central server because it would be insane to write the same code multiple times (correctly). If you just have one client type then you can stick to the current set up.
Mind to elaborate more on the data you are trying to save? How do the entity table looks like? What if you saved 2 rows / records for the 2 elements inside the array?
Yeah, nah, fuck that noise, I'm sticking with po. Can someone flair me?
You need a larger screen to be more productive. Why not take a look t the iMac?
Nice to know.
How does it suck?
Well, that sucks.
What does po show for that same object?

I've taken to working on my new textbook [Intro to Swift](https://books.apple.com/us/book/into-to-logic/id1460326828?ls=1)! Further, I'm building a whole tech school around it (with more textbooks to come).
But does it work? Half of the time it prints garbage.

Yes, I know the book cover says "Into to Logic", this has been FIXED and been pushed. It has just yet to take in the Apple Book system!

What resource did you find best for learning as you go?
Even Turbo Pascal had proper debugging. Debugging iOS apps is terrible
MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015), i5, 8GB
I think everyone has their favorites and there’s a ton of great resources out there. Personally I like Angela Yu’s course on Udemy (never pay full price on that site. They always have sales where you can get the courses for $10-20). The other that I really liked is Paul Hudson’s 100 days of Swift. I’m actually doing that one now. It’s completely free and covers a ton of topics. Part of that course is to start a habit of coding everyday. He doesn’t encourage you to power through, although you can if you want, but instead to do one day at a time but do it everyday to develop a habit of learning and coding on a regular basis. Others that people often recommend are raywenderlich.com, Sean Allen (YouTube), Kiloloco (YouTube), Big Nerd Ranch and tons more.

Color me dumb, but where can I read the sample book? When I click on the link all I can see is that it's going to be published on July 1st and when I click on "View in Apple Books" nothing happens. I also tried to look for it manually in the apple book store app, no luck either. (I'm a beginner and maybe I'm overlooking sth obvious)
i clicked on the link and took me right to apple books and below the pre-order it says read sample.
Hm alright thanks :0 I'll try it later again on desktop
Sweet i’m going to try out that 100 days of Swift, thanks!
This really hits home. Coming from Visual Studio, where you can simply hover over anything and everything all the time, XCode is painful. I haven't had so many 'print' statements since gnu c++.
It is. It doesn't work a significant percentage of the time. I just went back to p
lol nope
After maybe a year of learning with the help of hacking with swift courses by u/twostraws and others, I released a meditation timer app. [Simple Insight Timer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simple-insight-timer/id1434624014?mt=8). Now I need to figure out what next to work on. Either a new project or updates to the app.
If you assign classes to xib elements correctly, you should be able to browse available outlets at the inspector on the right, there is a tab for it. And yes, you need to set proper class for every linked object on the screen. Moving view code to view controller is basically a bad idea, ‘cause why do you need layers if you are gonna put all the code in a single file anyway. Speaking of the right way to handle it – there is none, it’s on your preference/habits. But i would personally encourage you to not use xibs at all. Xibs may save you some time right now, but will take from you control and flexibility, increase package size, compilation time, etc. ; not even speaking of source control, since xib file is a giant xml mess which xcode change as it sees fit.
Congratulations! Getting the first app out is always the hardest, I think.
Yeah, it’s a bit noisy. gives a better understanding of how stuff works under the hood though
Tap the three dots in the top right on mobile and top open on Safari!
It was fine until they introduced Swift. Debugging ObjC was a dream compared to this.
Thanks! It's hard to know when to polish, finish up, and release it versus tinkering on TestFlight builds forever.
Of course, but given your lack of experience with Swift, and probably also app development, I’d recommend you to start with some beginner tutorials to get you started. Doing what you ask will require you to know quite a bit of how both Swift and iOS development works.
oki thanks... I thought about swift just to answer to a need and not for fun \^\^' but no problem I'll do it manually as I do now.
I tried and as expected with Xcode, it did not work. Xcode is the worst IDE ever created by satan himself, that is the head of the development department at Apple. Satan and his minions are also responsible for the documentation department. They are specialized in creating crappy and vague documentations, with a lot of stuff missing. They don't give a fuck. The only exception is the Swift manual, written by someone in heaven who managed to get hold of this particular documentation. Xcode is a half-corner-of-one-star application, like almost all the documentation. Swift docs are 4.5 stars.
Oh shit that worked, thanks!
Yep the Apple resources are a great way to start
Which would you start with
App development w swift might be more engaging if you want to jump right in - but the swift book will set good foundations - both are good resources so either way I think it’ll be a good start
That's really sick man! Remember you can use image recognition with ARKit to respond to your tat! This has made mine much more exciting, for instance you could recognize the swift bird and make it appear to fly off of your arm.
I may look into this... it would be pretty cool to have the tat and the app made by me.
There could be a million reasons why, can you at least post the error screenshot or the crash text?
oof
Xcode really, reeaaaallllyy needs the hover over to view a variables type for swift. It’s so painfully annoying having to figure out the type that a function returns by first having to type out the name of that variable for autocompletion to tell me the type. I feel like I’m in the dark ages when working in macOS compared to what Microsoft has in their IDE.
I just use p not po
San Francisco doesnt have a local iOS meetup.
lol at a bunch of fucking iOS developers whining about problems with a debugger as if any of you were even competent enough to serve as an intern to one of Apples toolchain engineers.
I use `expr print(...)`. I know it's verbose, but it actually gets you what you want. `expr` lets you execute any expression in Swift, and `print` is the same one you'd use inside your code. If you `po` a dictionary, you get all the info you need, but IMO it's unreadable. If you `expr print(dictionary)`, you get exactly what you'd want.
Lynda.com, which is now merged with LinkedIn Learning, has many great Swift courses. The one I used when starting my Swift development was Swift 5 Essentials. It takes you through all of the fundamentals in a very thorough and clear way. Keep in mind it assumes that you are at least somewhat familiar with the concept of variables, loops, etc. in their premise, but it does teach you how to code them within respect to Swift. Best of luck!
Thank you. I suspect you’re right, I got more done today just working in code than I have done in days of screwing around with xibs. I’m very much still learning, maybe there are good use cases for xibs? My UI is complex but simple, lots of textfields. Doing this in code seems the way to go.
I’ll be sure to look into this, thanks!
Tip: You can alt click on variables to see the type
No worries, feel free to reach out with any questions you may have! Just a tip, myself and many colleagues got lynda.com for free as it was included in our local library card benefits. If you have a library card, try checking if your library supports licenses!
You forgot to initialize `x` on line 372.
Right, so you cannot complain about a car unless you can take apart the engine and put it back together? Can't complain about a meal unless you are a gourmet chef? The engineers create products to be used and users have the right to complain.
Uh, well in this analogy the iOS developers are chefs, too. They are $10 chain restaurant chefs walking into a gourmet restaurant and complaining about the way something is cooked. Toolchain work is fucking hard. There's a reason why nearly 100% of the developers on those projects are senior engineers at tech giants making &gt; $300k. If lldb has bugs it's probably because they are really really fucking hard to fix.
You can use a stack view (UIStackView) to easily add text fields. Another option is a table view.
You can add a navigation controller or you can just add a button anywhere on the screen and have it call segue back to the view you want to go to, either works I believe
Late 2013, 13" MacBook Pro (running Mojave) Runs great but struggles in simulator ( I just use my phone instead of the inbuilt simulator)
Yes you can, you can add as many columns as you want and nest them as much as you want
Lol yeah word. I’m an actual professional iOS dev and I honestly love Xcode and the tools it gives me. These guys are misdirecting their frustration or something.
⬆️ Also a great tips ladies and gentlemen
Yes, if you want to do that and not refresf it during app relaunch that works. Just remember it might feel weird for the user if he is scrolling and the app suddenly refreshes
