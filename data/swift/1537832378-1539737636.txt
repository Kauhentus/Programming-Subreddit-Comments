There may well be method to get cpu percentage from the pid, but if not you could shell out and parse the result of the ps command.
Ah, as far as I know iOS doesn't have XMLDocument (and you can't call HTML Tidy even if it's included), so in the context of iOS the solution is probably still to find a wrapper around libxml2.
Are you asking ‚Äúwhat is an ‚Äòif‚Äô statement‚Äù ?
Why not answer the question if that's that easy instead of being sarcastic?
 if indexPath.section == 0 { return nil } 
it says Nil is incompatible with return type "UICollectionReusableView" sir
Show me your code
Done adding it below the image sir. It's just the snip for section codes. If you need other snips just tell me. Thanks
Return CGSize.zero in referenceSizeForHeaderInSection if the section is 0. In that case, viewForSupplementaryElement... won‚Äôt even get called
Perhaps it is because I am trying to use it in Playground only rather than working with ViewController and the Simulator. From looking at coding examples I was hoping that: timer = Timer.scheduledTimer(timeInterval: 1, target: self, selector: #selector(cycle), userInfo: nil, repeats: true) func cycle(){ print("tick") } would result in cycle() being called once a second. No such luck.
No answer?
Like i already said, its a basic if statement, if you want nothing just return UICollectionReusableView() 
Did this if indexPath.section == 0 { return UICollectionReusableView() } else { return sectionFooterView } andddddd, my app crashed
Did you register your empty view ? You will still probably need referenceSizeForFooterInSection
Thank you very much for your detailled information! But why does the ViewController initialize the Controller? Shouldn't the Main Controller initialize the View and the Models to update them? In your example the ViewController is the main Coordinator, which is responsible for the View but also for the Controllers to be delcleared, even though the logic of the Controller is outsourced. But shouldn't the Controller be the Coordinator and manage the whole app? Thank you very much :) 
yeah :D I just tried to work without the storyboard tho :D
It's not like there's no demand. Where talking tech here after all. Not some liberal art like philosophy.
I think my brain is also wired like OP. For some reason, I always have to think for a bit when applying these functions. Glad I'm not the only one...
You missed the point of my post. The point was that I think the names of these functions are misleading.
Because, when you say max it sounds like a constraint, a maximum of &lt;insert value&gt; are allowed.
Eyyyy
How is returning the MAX of two values misleading?
When your math teacher asks you to find the maximum of two values, what do you do? Where do you get this limit / constraint thing? Which value would be the limit in your case? Why is it the second one? &amp;#x200B; To answer your questions: &gt; Wouldnt it be better to change the names of these in Swift to something like lowest() and highest() ? No, since this has been a naming convention everywhere since forever. &gt;Or am I the only one getting confused by these? Apparently not, but you're definitely in the minority.
You might want to look at clamp method from ruby. This is somewhat similar to your understanding.
Dealing with dates is a world appart, no matter the language üôÇ You have different ways to reach it, but try to start creating a Date with a Calendar and [DateComponents](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/datecomponents) 
Thanks for your answer! I tried it with *let dateB = Date(timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate: +541641600.0) and now have my date :)*
Thanks for your answer i tried it with the first method mentioned and have now my date Thank you so much :)
Nice! üòÄ
This. 
You want `max` to return the smaller of two numbers??
I want it to be renamed for less chance of misunderstanding. Maximum is partly defined as the greatest allowed value meaning there is a threshold involved and thus one of the parameters (most intuitively imo the second parameter) would be the threshold making it have to return the lowest value.
The standard terms for what you are thinking of are variants of ‚Äúclip‚Äù and ‚Äúclamp‚Äù. IIRC, there was a proposal to add those to the swift stdlib, but I don‚Äôt know if it went anywhere. 
Ahaa, I didnt know of that!
Sidenote: \`repeat\` is not the same as \`while\`. \`repeat {} while ()\` is the same as \`do while\` in other languages which is basically a \`while\` loop (that also exists in swift!) that runs at least one time. &amp;#x200B; Two things: 1.) You're not a native speaker. This is important to note because you're challenging common understandings about how words are used in a language you might not have a perfect grasp upon. 2.) Your way of thinking is not unconventional. Imo you're simply not reducing the problem to its barest bones. &amp;#x200B; Maybe it's clearer when we use more than 2 values and use a collection instead. The problem commonly solved by max is "Give me the maximum of these values": \`\[a...b\].max()\` The problem you want to solve is "Give me the maximum of these values, limited by another value": \[a...b\].max().limited(by: c) See the difference now? It's two different problems. 
I have done a lot of work with dates and they can be complicated. Here is what I would do: &amp;#x200B; let dateA = Date().timeIntervalSince1970 let dateB = Date().timeIntervalSince1970 &amp;#x200B; Get the difference between the two and divide by 86400 (number of seconds / day). &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Where are you getting this constraint from? "the greatest allowed value" out of two values is the bigger value. 
&gt; You're right, thank you for the discussion. Anytime! And I hope I didn't come across as rude.
Hey, I really like your project! I was just looking around on your code and show me something that I think would improve a little bit, so I made a PR. &amp;#x200B; I hope you don't mind. &amp;#x200B; Cheers man! Keep the good work.
No no, not at all üëç
You really shouldn't work with time intervals. The problem is they don't account for changes in a calendar, such as leap days and seconds. Instead you should use `Calendar`: import Foundation let components = DateComponents(year: 2018, month: 3, day: 2) let calendar = Calendar.current if let start = calendar.date(from: components), let difference = calendar.dateComponents([.day], from: start, to: Date()).day { print(difference) // 207 } 
Neat. TIL. Thank you.
It's not difficult at all to create a basic app. In fact, just opening Xcode and making a new project will create an app. It won't do much but it will run just fine. Swift is a pretty easy language, not the simplest but certainly one of the safer languages. However, it will take quite a bit of learning to create a complex app like a game or a social app. Start small, realize that it might take six months or a year to make something sizable and even then the app will probably be pretty basic compared to the polished apps that large companies put out. You don't mention anything about your level of knowledge or background, those will greatly influence how you learn and the tools you have at your disposal.
Hard is relative. New to programming? You‚Äôre going to have a hard time. Experienced with object oriented languages, somewhat easy. Start with YouTube. 
As per the documentation &gt; Important &gt; &gt; You must assign your delegate object to the UNUserNotificationCenter object before your app finishes launching. For example, in an iOS app, you must assign it in the application(_:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:) or application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:) method of your app delegate. Assigning a delegate after these methods are called might cause you to miss incoming notifications. Essentially you receive the notification before your view controller initializes that's why you are missing them. You either have to assign another object as a delegate (a singleton manager for example) and initialize it on app launch or use the func application(UIApplication, didReceiveRemoteNotification: [AnyHashable : Any], fetchCompletionHandler: (UIBackgroundFetchResult) -&gt; Void) on your application delegate to receive remote notifications on launch time. Another option is to use func getPendingNotificationRequests(completionHandler: ([UNNotificationRequest]) -&gt; Void) from UNUserNotificationCenter
Yeah I realize that and thanks for your input. New to it. I've created simple websites for restaurants but I used Adobe Muse. So doesn't really count. And I started browsing around but it gets intimidating fast. 
Start small, try a few little things at first. Don't aim to make an app, instead do little number and text manipulations in a playground (Xcode-&gt;File-&gt;New-&gt;Playground‚Ä¶-&gt;Blank) Find some online guides or courses and give it a try. Set your goals small at first and then build up to bigger things. Try to find a group of people to work with, that helps too.
IMO, you have the basics of Swift then you have more advanced parts of it. You can do a lot by just using Swift to make API calls. You can make a specific app, like a todo app or a display weather info app just by watching a 1 hr tutorial. No advanced Swift needed. It's really when you get into the advanced or custom apps that it gets harder. You want things to behave a certain way, it can take a long time to figure out. Making an app that's well structured and ready to go into long term service is a different issue. That's where things start to get complex. Then there's the issue of your background. I'd give it a good run and see what you think. After a month or two, you should have an idea of how hard it is.
Max is used by mathematicians everywhere regardless of their native language. It's short for "maxima" which is a Latin word. Mathematicians use Greek and Latin words specifically so that mathematicians who don't speak the same language can understand each other.
You override the loadView function and just instantiate your view class there. Your VC can be generic, so you only see the methods provided by the protocol and then decide the actual class in your coordinator/navigator. So if you want to have different layout for different screen sizes, you can use the same VC with different view easily.
Days are not guaranteed to be 86400 seconds long ‚Äî this fails to account for DST (and on platforms where it matters, leap seconds and minutes).
Thanks a lot. Your version looks a lot better and yes it is what i was looking for (sorry for the formatting) 
You mean make uibutton the right way using the proper size you want and then use image insets to make image smaller, right?
Better to write a bit more code and make it readable than use less and have bugs. You'll actually save time in the end by writing clear code. Glad to help.
Search for ‚Äúhacking with swift‚Äù. It‚Äôs a course made by Paul Hudson. It‚Äôs free and imho pretty good. You will be making basic apps while learning the language. After you invested around 5 hours you will be able to answer your own question. 
By my count about 12 of those "bugs" weren't bugs at all but rather griping about the quality of support and documentation. Still, there are some good lessons in there about running a business.
is that really so bad though? so much of open source is unfortunately done for free. Seems like a fair trade off, that if you're offering something of value to the community for free, at least you can get paid in self promotion, if people won't actually give you money for your efforts.
The view controller doesn't initialise the controller, the controller is *injected* into the view controller (via `init()` or some other method depending on whether you're using Storyboard or NIBs). You will have a protocol for the controller, for example - `protocol MyControllerProtocol: class {}` and then an implementation of that protocol, for example - `final class MyConcreteController: MyControllerProtocol {}`. In your view controller, you'll have a property, like: `var controller: MyControllerProtocol?` and an `init` method, like: `init(withController controller: MyControllerProtocol = MyConcreteController()`. This will allow you inject a different controller if you want (maybe a `MyMockController` when doing unit tests) or simply use the default controller if no controller is specified. In the Coordinator pattern, we use a `UIViewController` as a coordinator because we want to use the `UIViewController`s properties, such as `addChild(_:)` to add child coordinators or view controllers. It can be a bit confusing, but even though we're inheriting from `UIViewController`, we're not displaying anything - just managing the flow of view controllers. A coordinator can contain other coordinators, which can contain other coordinators and those coordinators can contain a single view (controller). Think of it as a tree - you have the main coordinator (parent) at the top, then many child coordinators (child) and at the end you have a view (leaf).
There's no reason you can't use core data without touching objective c. 
Just googling "core data swift 4" came up with tons of clean examples of how to get a nice persistent data store off the ground, you'll have to be more specific about what your hangup is.
I‚Äôm not sure what you mean. But the way UITableView and UICollectionView work is as they scroll they only call cellForItemAt for the cells that are visible. So yes if you are trying print stuff out from those call backs it will look like its printing random. Do you understand how the updating and drawing of cells work? If not you really should go find some blogs or videos where it‚Äôs explained.
What is the reason that you don‚Äôt want to use any objective c attributes?
I‚Äôm trying to learn Swift, and I feel like it is a bit of a tangent.
So say I am representing a book and I want the uicollectionview cells to represent the pages. To currently put the pages and display their content on the cells, I need the current indexpath.item number. like pages = [1,2,3,4,5] then I'd render then like cell.text = pages[indexpath.item] I hope this explains it better :/ 
I use https://www.raywenderlich.com/ extensively, has a lot of useful information
Check out the Stanford app development course.
Using any online resource at the beginning will suffice. Such as: [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/swift/](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/swift/) [https://www.raywenderlich.com/961-swift-tutorial-part-1-expressions-variables-constants](https://www.raywenderlich.com/961-swift-tutorial-part-1-expressions-variables-constants) &amp;#x200B; I would also recommend watching pretty much any youtube video which is popular such as: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OZ07fklur8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OZ07fklur8) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Zf79Ns8\_oY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Zf79Ns8_oY) &amp;#x200B; BUT most importantly I would say just get coding. The best way to learn any language, and to learn how to program is to practice. Choose a small project such as a table view which you can add items to, or something hopefully more related to the app you are trying to build and build it. At the beginning it will be tricky, you will get a lot of errors, and things may not look the way you want. However, keep in mind it is just going to get easier the more you do it. If you start building an app to practice, just dive into it. For example: Choose a starting point such as creating a table view, then google "How do I add an item to a table view programatically in swift." And continue on building your app until you feel comfortable enough to embark on a more advanced project. &amp;#x200B; Hope this helps. &amp;#x200B;
I‚Äôve been a professional developer for a long time. I still google every day. That‚Äôs just part of being a good programmer. Never remember anything you can google !
&gt; get cpu percentage from the pid Yes, this is what I am trying to figure out. Last effort would be using top and parsing the results.
I don‚Äôt think. I believe they are delaying it in favor of ABI stability.
If you‚Äôre curious about what‚Äôs changing apart from ABI stability, I wrote an article you might find useful: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/126/whats-new-in-swift-5-0 Also, my site www.whatsnewinswift.com has been updated to reflect the new features.
The features listed so far do not seem ground breaking enough to grant the 4 to 5 change, which suggests non backward compatibility. Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.
&gt; rankly, try writing some more software. Thank you for your thoughtful response. I never claimed that other software or support was perfect. The article states that Snap NEEDS a win here. And because they are doing such a poor job, I doubt they will win. It isn't that software is supposed to be perfect. It isn't that others never have issues. It is that Snap is out to prove itself and as a business this effort is failing in my view. I suggest you avoid such judgemental language as "rankly, try writing some more software." I know the software industry very well. I never claimed my solutions were novel. P.S. Snap has invited me to their headquarters to interview me and discuss further the business issues I have identified
Admittedly I should have avoided that last line, it was unnecessarily hostile. With that said, I still think a lot of the issues you‚Äôve mentioned seem somewhat standard in terms of what I‚Äôve seen working with platforms/sdks, with a lot of nitpicks that have somewhat simple workarounds or things to learn. When that‚Äôs coupled with a number of years of experience to justify that opinion it sounds more like an appeal to ethos than one of pathos. The business lessons though admittedly are alright, I did skim over those and I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôll be able to air your concerns with Snapchat in that respect - I did skim over those as I was more interested in the technical aspects than the business side of things, so I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt at least credit that in my response. 
Your help is greatly appreciated thank you
Not a problem. It's reddit. And yes the issues are standard. However seeing so many of them so concentrated is not usual IMO. At least Snap's position in the industry is such that they cannot afford so many. To me it is clear they didn't bother with a Release Manager - whos job is to watch for this kind of stuff. And although there are simple workarounds, in my experience companies do not implement them. Or they do not understand the value of them. They don't get the main lesson here. That support is part of the product. That documentation is part of the product. That a customer's experience is part of the product. Speaking again about simple workaround - I disagree. Simple in that the fix requires very little - however getting an organization on board with many of them is a huge challenge. Support will say they have no time to test the documentation or website and that they don't have time to participate in discussions about releases. QA will have the same objections. Documentation will say they are too busy with new docs to go and fix the old. And docs team will complain that they rely on devs for their core content - and dev gave them bad content. No one will OWN the responsibility that all these "simple things" should actually be done. Snap can't afford to let stuff fall through the cracks. Thanks again for reading
It's all a out that ABI. While you're not wrong about the language level changes, functionally there will be a strong push to Swift 5 like their was for Swift 3.
Don't worry about it being iOS 11. Udemy has a few good ones in there, the Angela Yu and Ray W are good.
Anyone know the official link to what's new in swift 5.0? Thanks
I never missed that. Didn't like it in C# too much either. Never made things that much easier.
It‚Äôs kinda nice for quickly slopping shit together, but I don‚Äôt want my Swift to look like that.
Honestly I‚Äôd upgrade to Mojave and use the new API if you are starting a new project. What‚Äôs nice about the new User Notification API is that it‚Äôs compatible with iOS and has a lot more complex features.
Can you show us code, especially the cellForItemAt code.

Thanks for the heads up. 
Speaking of podcasts, has anyone tried the new Swift over Coffee? I haven't heard it yet, wondering if it's advanced or just more entry level stuff.
Use Mogenerator to create objective-c classes from entities automatically, then use swift extensions for custom logic. You won‚Äôt need to deal with objective-c that way. I also strongly recommend Magical Record when working with CoreData.

You need to add you class as a UICollectionViewDelegateFlowLayout to make that get called. You register the empty one the same way you registered your other footer, collectionView.register() the one with supplementary view and just put UICollectionViewReusableView.self as the class
Wow... adding the `UICollectionViewDelegateFlowLayout` solved my problem. With that, my `referenceSizeForFooterInSection` and `referenceSizeForHeaderInSection` is finally getting executed. Thanks a lot. You saved me. Sorry for the trouble.
&gt;UICollectionViewDelegateFlowLayout Problem solved sir :) The reason why my `referenceSizeForFooterInSection` is not getting executed is because I haven't added the `UICollectionViewDelegateFlowLayout` to my class. Thanks a lot. Sorry for the trouble.

Hi r/swift! This is my first cocoapods/library.

I've seen the other guy and read posts from you, that's why I asked about it. I think you two could be a good combo. One thing I haven't seen in any of these podcasts is project failure analysis. Basically, it looks at what went wrong with a project. I think AirBnB or some other larger company did an analysis of switching to ReactNative and why it didn't pan out.

If you're going to "ping" a website, you'll want to use a HEAD request instead of a GET request. To see if a website is up you don't need the whole website, just the headers. It will save time and bandwidth: import Foundation import PlaygroundSupport PlaygroundPage.current.needsIndefiniteExecution = true if let url = URL(string: "https://reddit.com") { var request = URLRequest(url: url) request.httpMethod = "HEAD" let session = URLSession(configuration: .default) session.dataTask(with: request) { (data, response, error) -&gt; Void in if let error = error { print("Error:", error) return } if let httpResponse = response as?

"Connection reset by peer" suggests an error on the server-side, it couldn't continue the connection so it reset it. Perhaps try a different site and see if the error persists.
Right I always use functions to handle whatever happens in the block, unless I need to do a weak/strong dance first. Functions are testable, blocks usually aren't.
Yo
Yes? Lol
Hah, I was responding to the "yo" in your post. Then I realized you might just have mistyped "to".
I don‚Äôt even see a yo in the post at all so I‚Äôm confused 
&gt; I‚Äôm newish yo swift 
Oh lol I literally skimmed the whole thing 4 times and still missed the second word haha thanks 
Love your tutorials. Any chance any sales are happening soon? I want to purchase some more but a little short on funds at the moment.
No problem, it's so easy to do. I miss stuff like that all the time. As far as your question, there are a lot of tutorials out there on building user interfaces. You can do it in code or using the [Interface Builder](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/interface-builder/) part of Xcode. I don't know of any good guides to doing this but here's one I found with a quick search. It may be a bit out-of-date but it will at least get you started: [Xcode Tutorial for Beginners](https://codewithchris.com/xcode-tutorial/)
Hmm thanks I‚Äôll check it out after work. I used sketch and designed the whole app and then I asked how to import it and everyone was like oh you can‚Äôt lol I used the 2D gaming engine in swift to make my app and it came out great so ima put some work in and do some research and hopefully have the same outcome. 
Look at storyboards/InterfaceBuilder...
Thanks. I‚Äôm loading up xCode now so I can check it out. 
I don't have any sales soon, I'm afraid, but if you're able to wait until the US thanksgiving holiday I suspect you can save money then.
I tried this app there was a issue and it didn‚Äôt work to be honest I‚Äôm not sure what happened it was over a year ago but yeah interface builder I‚Äôm looking into now 
Are you testing your private functions? 
Clicking on the red icons didn‚Äôt do much just explained it to me but that didn‚Äôt help much as I‚Äôm still pretty new. I am taking a course on udemy now for iOS 12 but for now I‚Äôm still unsure how to fix the errors 
You‚Äôre likely to get more help if you post a specific code, what the error message is, and what you Googled/tried. 
Should I just copy and paste the whole code or just the section that gave me a error? 
I‚Äôd start with just the code sections that gave you the error. So if a line is throwing you a compiler error, first try googling the error. If you still don‚Äôt know how to fix it, then ask a specific question about it and include what you researched :)

Ok, so it stops being free. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be paid for your work. I think that the expectation that people do things for free really devalues developers' work, and I wish the community as a whole was more supportive of each other in this way. 
Nothing wrong with being paid buddy, like I said then its just not "Free". Most people dont really do things for free but when we do we dont expect anything in return.
&gt; Are you testing your private functions? I wouldn't know how? But you can test the ones that aren't and might be interesting to test. But I think functions sometimes just help make things more readable. Once in a while I even declare a function inside of a function just to document what I'm attempting to do inside of the block. func process(list: [Stuff]) { func isRotten(item: Stuff) -&gt; Bool { item.date == Date(a long time ago) &amp;&amp; item.type == .perishable } remove(list.filtered(isRotten)) } Now you've documented that you're removing them because they're rotten, which isn't clear if you use an anonymous block. Mixing callbacks (flow) with actual stuff happening kind of pollutes the scope of a function. I prefer to see a very simple flow and the actual thing that happens after the callback in another function.
I was just commenting on your statement that functions are more testable than blocks. I agree function names can add more context to make readability easier. I‚Äôm not sure how it affects async/await though. I may just be missing something. 
here is a line of code everything i googled just ended me up with alot more errors **override** **func** touchesBegan(**\_** touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, with event: UIEvent?) 1. 'touchesBegan(\_:with:)' previously overridden here

The best I can think of is the following youtube tutorial I hope that helped [https://youtu.be/Qm8fGctP\_5s](https://youtu.be/Qm8fGctP_5s) &amp;#x200B;
I like to follow the youtube channel lets build that app website [https://www.letsbuildthatapp.com](https://www.letsbuildthatapp.com)
It's defined as `\`default\`` because `default` is a reserved word, but it's called with just `.default` because it's unambiguous in context. So, the backticks are not a typo, but definitely not required when using the API.
Thank you for the suggestion!
I didn't check the code, is this from the Angela Yu tutorial? IIRC, she did a great job on that one. It's been about a year since I looked at it, but I think it did the same things. It was a good example of using extensions.
Ahh, interesting. I wondered if it was purposeful or a mistake in documentation. Thanks for the information. I did: `` `default` `` It's a bit tricky!
You guys rock! I now know what I‚Äôm doing for the next three months. üòÇ
Thank you for your reply buddy and sorry I didn't check reddit over the past day. I have read on the didReceiveRemoteNotification in the app delegate. So to fix my problem, would I just copy whatever code I had in my view controller regarding handling remote notification to the didReceiveRemoteNotification section?
The Big Nerd Ranch Swift book (note: not the iOS Programming book... that‚Äôs more advanced) is where I started. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs been updated since Swift 3 but the fundamentals of Swift haven‚Äôt changed much since then anyways. But I would highly recommend that book to someone who has absolutely zero programming knowledge.

+1 to this. This is perfect for someone trying to learn the swift language.
Hey thanks for the awesome explanation. Its actually http://www.appleiphonecell.com I have used it because it works everywhere even in China (otherwise I was going to use https://www.google.com) Is there any other website which works everywhere in the world which I can use instead of http://appleiphonecell.com ?
I'd suggest [https://www.raywenderlich.com](https://www.raywenderlich.com). Can take your pick or form a combination of videos, books, articles etc.
Also, swift doesn't follow semver right now.
&gt;It's been about a year since I looked at it, but No its not although I took that course. But this is purely made by me.
Sure, but its episodes are still worth listening to.
&gt; There is a "Create a Table" section, but not one which explains how to open an existing one? That doesn't make sense. You don't "open" tables in SQL. You just query them. https://github.com/stephencelis/SQLite.swift/blob/master/Documentation/Index.md#selecting-rows

Wow! This is super helpful to my current project! Thank you :) I was hoping to do some testing with userbob.com but this was the missing piece to make it smooth enough to work. Ooh but each link can be used only once?
From App store Connect: &gt; You‚Äôll have the option to set a limit for the number of testers that can join a group through your public link, and you can disable the link at any time.
Are you trying to test one site in particular or are you trying to test your overall network connection?
Hi, I‚Äôm almost in the same pace of you. What I‚Äôm doing and is working for me is start with little steps. I started with Angela and Ray Udemy courses but, in some pace some things they will teach you‚Äôll need to have a better background on the Swift language. So I took a step back to really try to understand Swift first, and after that, I‚Äôll go back to the video tutorials. My sources are the e-books listed below: https://swift.org/download/ http://amz.onl/1HjE5bC They are make me more comfortable on learning the language at all. 
To be fair, the release time being 2019 should surprise no one. After all, they just released Swift 4.2 and it's highly unlikely that they would follow-up with a new major release within a couple of months. I'd say at least 6 months of Swift 4.2 would be a fair minimum estimate.
I'm not sure what you mean by a class now being in Swift, you mean they don't inherit from [`NSObject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject)? Because [`UIViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller) inherits from [`UIResponder`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiresponder) which inherits from `NSObject`. It really doesn't matter too much what language the classes are written in, as long as the bridge is written properly it should be nearly indistinguishable from a native class.
How did you notice that? 
childviewcontorllers is renemed to children, and when i went to see documentation of that property it was in swift file.
Exacly, the properties we use for example in UIViewControllers looks to be in swift. It does not change anything, but it is a fun fact.
I'm not sure it's a fact at all, see my [other comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/9jdrmc/uikit_is_rewrtiting_in_swift/e6qrqlq/).
Check out Apple's Documentation on [Renaming Objective-C APIs for Swift](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/objective-c_and_c_code_customization/renaming_objective-c_apis_for_swift). ```objc @property NSArray&lt;UIViewController *&gt; childViewControllers NS_SWIFT_NAME(children); ```
‚Ä¶wasn‚Äôt this already announced at WWDC? I feel like I remember that. 
It was. I don't know what the point of this article is when it's all already-known information. One thing it says is: &gt;Guess what else was happening on June 5, 2018? WWDC. Sneaky. No. They literally announced it there. Lol
if you have 0 experience, I strongly urge you to start with the intro to app development swift by apple. its free. 
Thanks for your reply! In the original post I added screenshots of both the Xcode project and the DB4S. I've tried querying, but I just get unresolved identifier errors everywhere. That is why I asked whether I had to put in the lines of code with the the Expressions as else I thought that Xcode wouldn't know what I was referring to with id, frage, r0, f1, f2 and f3. Those are the column names as seen in the DB4S screenshot.
Apple can't really switch to native Swift classes in Cocoa (Touch) until ABI stability hits, so I would be very surprised to see any classes in UIKit being written in Swift unless they were something that could have been distributed as a header only library in Objective-C.
Nope
Do testflight releases still need to go through an approval process? If so, testflight is still dead to me.
By using just the MacBook you can ultimately become more comfortable with the idea of working anywhere / anytime. Monitor addiction is real...
The answer to your question is yes, but if I were you I‚Äôd start with another language such as Pascal or C. Pascal was invented to teach programming and as a result is a good first language. C is more difficult but it is also a good language to learn as a first or second language because many of today‚Äôs languages are ancestors of C, and as a result C provides a great foundation for learning principles of computer programming.
I used to swear by a second monitor as a huge productivity gain until I worked with a developer who was easily the most productive guy I had ever known and he worked with a single monitor. I asked him how he did it and he told me how he used to have several monitors. First he went to 2 then 3 and finally 4. Then he went back to one by changing how he worked to be more efficient. He realises he was more productive when he was more focused and a single screen allowed him to focus on one thing. I decided to try and imitate his workflow for a while and never looked back. Life just got simpler with a single screen. It is hard to explain and it is painful for the first few weeks but then it just kinda clicked for me. I could get and stay in ‚Äúthe zone‚Äù way easier and my neck and eye strain went away as I wasn‚Äôt always making small motions to look either side. Not saying it works for everyone but I don‚Äôt think I could go back to multiple monitors. Also I looked into all the major studies about productivity gains for multiple monitors and saw a common theme. They were all paid for or sponsored by companies that would benefit from saying more monitors is best. Dell, HP, Lenovo, BenQ, LG, etc. That isn‚Äôt perfect evidence the results were bused but it was a little strange that I couldn‚Äôt find any independent research to backup their claims. 
Ever since someone pointed out to me the advantages of using a 24‚Äù display in portrait mode, I‚Äôve found it difficult to be without my monitors as well.
I use two monitors. Yes, I can see how it could actually hurt productivity. You might notice you keep popping over to your browser on one. Where you can then go to FB, Twitter, Reddit etc. Fortunately I hate FB and Twitter and hate aspects of Reddit. But still, I find myself reading news and that often wastes time. When I‚Äôm in the zone though, I have playground or some related program and simulation running on one and my project on the other. I think if I do it over, I‚Äôll just get one big ass screen. Not fool myself into thinking the project open on one is the same as actually working on it :D. 
Hey, I have no idea but my hunch would maybe be it's a by value/by reference issue? Since they're both "B" it sounds like strVar1 and strVar2 are pointers to the same memory.
Its basically always that price, it really is worth it
For you that could very well be true. After all we all work differently. For me I find virtual desktops work superbly. However macOS isn't perfect. It is a bit of a pain to maintain my desktop configuration. I would prefer something like I can do on Linux running i3wm or dwm, etc. but macOS can work well enough to be a net positive for me. This is mostly due to how well gestures work with the trackpad though, I struggle on a Windows machine even with similar functionality for virtual desktops simply because the trackpads on Windows machines are smaller and not as responsive as on my MBP. But like I said it isn't for everyone. What works well for me will probably suck for you and vice versa. I know someone who almost can't function without his *eight* monitors! As extreme as that is :)
IMHO, it's doable if: # You use Desktops (n√©e Spaces), and full-screen everything # You don't use Interface Builder # You are fluent with Cmd-0 (toggle left navigation) and Cmd-Option-0 (toggle right info bar) in Xcode And then it's doable. However, I'm getting older (*waves cane*) and I appreciate my creature comforts. A split keyboard, a mouse AND a trackpad, and a good posture are all part of my routine. And my 28" monster of a monitor comes along with that too.
Ahh thanks. Yep I want to check if my internet is up or not so I need the simplest website. I'll use the captive one since its very small :)
I have 3. Get a fucking monitor. They are cheap. 
Prosciutto.
I can get on just as productively with one screen, largely thanks to the swipe gestures on the trackpad. I generally use my apps full screen, and switch between them using the three finger swipe left/right gesture. I also make heavy use of the three finger swipe up gesture for switching between windowed apps, and I have a hot corner for showing the desktop. The one exception is Interface Builder in Xcode; using that really depends on having a decent sized screen - 12/13 inches just isn‚Äôt big enough...
Not true. Timestamps are in Unix time, which is always 86400 seconds. 
I'll do some digging and see if there's any better option but if a large corporation like Apple uses this solution then it's likely to be one of the better ones in the first place.
Honestly it looks fine. Some types of code will never be elegant. You can use if-lets instead of force unwraps for safety but that's all I see. 
I wrote this for tvOS and it uses IB, but it might help: https://medium.com/@eric.dockery283/feature-banners-like-itunes-featured-movies-eff657cf6f4e
Great article thanks very much
So bassicly I wanna make a calendar app and have cells displaying the months of the year and then in the cells I‚Äôm ganna have it display the days of the month. Not sure if it‚Äôs the best approach 
Ya actually I like your method, my original method is inefficient, thank you üôè 
I just tried these steps and it also worked for me. Thanks!
If you are working purely in UNIX time, which assumes GMT, then yes ‚Äî however, this falls apart as soon as you need to work with timestamps in any time zone which has DST. The *interpretation* of ‚Äúwhat day/month/year/hour/minute/second does timestamp `t` represent in time zone `X` and locale `l`?‚Äù has to take a lot more into account. A single day in time zone `X` can be longer or shorter than a UNIX day due to a variety of factors, and the assumption that ‚Äú1 day == 86400 seconds‚Äù almost always leads to miscalculations as soon as you start working in the user‚Äôs local time zone (which is often).
Thank you very much, will look into it...
Thank you.
&gt; Also every if { } else { } statement should be broken up into two functions. The only place where you should use else is after a guard statement. This is generally overkill. Yes, you should avoid overly-complicated code and instead break things down into a series of smaller functions but `if‚Ä¶else` statements are useful and have their place. Trying to eliminate every use of them is over-complicating a simple pattern. 
We share a lot of code between iOS and macOS. We don't bother with creating frameworks because they are often more trouble than they are worth. In some cases we have separate project files and simply include all of the source files in each project. For individual projects with both Mac and iOS targets, we place all of the source and header files into the project in their own group/folder and make sure they're enabled for each target. It doesn't have to be complicated. 
Thanks for reply. &amp;#x200B; How do you usually deal with unit testing of the shared code? I'd avoid creating a framework however I have no clue how to create a separate test suite for shared code.
&gt; I know that I'm unable to create a single framework or library for both platforms /which sucks as I do not have any specific Kit dependencies/. Huh? I've done this for wrapping some C libraries. The framework works just fine for both iOS and macOS. I'll have to go back and look at what I did, but like you say, there were no specific -Kit dependencies. 
You can create two targets for unit testing. But if code is truly the same, then there is no point, test on macOS because it will be probably faster (no need to launch simulator).
I think you should test on each platform. Different processors. Different security models. There are lots of subtle bugs that can crop up. 
You can create different targets for testing. Frankly we usually have custom test applications/targets because Apple's test framework is sometimes limiting and annoying. Some of our C++ code runs on Windows too, so it's easier for us to use our own test applications.
It's a fairly common practice. Look at the App Store. Or Netflix. Or Spotify. Almost any app that needs to display a lot of different types of content involves collection views within collection view cells (or table view cells)
You need to make sure that the inner collection views aren't scrolling in any way. So make sure the content is big enough and second disable all scrolling gestures. Second of all you need to watch out using auto layouts. You'll have a ton of little cells floating around and I think doing manual positioning in this case is the best approach. Luckily days and months have predictable sizes so calculating by hand shouldn't be a huge deal. Make sure you handle events like resizing and rotation well. I don't think the idea is crazy and it scales nicely over wider (iPad) and narrow (iPhone portrait) screens.
You know this is built-in and free on iOS 12 / Mojave, right?
There is no pattern here. But there are a few moments where you would like to use them but the way they are used here never. Large blocks of code inside of if or else should always be separated out to their own functions. The only exception I would make is where a ternary wouldn't work because I want to use `if let`. Like: `let height: CGFloat` `if let aView = aView, let anotherView = anotherView {` `height = aView.frame.height + anotherView.frame.height` `} else {` `height = 0` `}`
It might be fairly common, and I've done it myself before, but a lot of the time people jump to the "tableview in a tableviewcell" approach early on in their career, when stepping back and thinking about perhaps a more efficient approach is the better idea. Just like this guy did!
This is something I'd like to achieve. However I have no clue how to use the same Swift test suite for two targets.
There are cocoa and cocoa touch framework targets you can create. There aren't any universal frameworks last i checked.
Yeah, I know that and already tried that. Simply I do not know how to share test cases with both targets (for iOS and Mac frameworks).
I currently have x2 24‚Äù displays, one in landscape and one in portrait. I‚Äôm not 100% sold on the portrait orientation. 
u/rorogadget and u/aosmialowski, the targets that are created just set some default build settings for you. Take a look at the architectures build settings. Here's a [sample project](https://github.com/balthisar/tidy-cocoa) that wraps a C library into a framework, with sample projects for iOS, macOS GUI, and macOS command line tool, in both Swift and Obj-C. You're not stuck with the canned stuff that Xcode gives you. Learn how to setup targets and schemes manually. The build system is as flexible as you need it to be. 
Oh, I agree that this code needs to be broken up into smaller, single responsibility units. Far too much is being done in a single unit and it's messy, fragile, and not easily self-documenting. I'm simply saying that there are logical extremes to both positions and perhaps the best solution is something in the middle.
Thanks a lot! I forgot to mention, I'm using Xcode just for a few days, so still learning lot of things and don't know all the features.
Same direction or different directions?
There was a time when I was incredibly comfortable and productive with an 11 inch netbook running ubuntu. The 11 inches was a bit tight, but the one monitor was not a hinderance at all because of virtual desktops plus a very flexible/configurable system for switching between apps on a desktop. It was much better than multi monitor. But there's no way I could do that these days on a mac with mission control. I have 2 huge screens to make up for mission control's poor UX because mousing waaaaaaaaay across 2 screens to switch apps is still more efficient than Apple's virtual desktop system that gets more useless every release.
Hey you may want to try our library. It's a reactive-flux implementation for iOS and macOS. https://eonfluxor.github.io/flask/ Let me know if you want to learn more.
Continuity camera https://www.macobserver.com/tips/quick-tip/mojave-continuity-camera/
Thanks for the response. Right now it is a local notification. So I think I will try something different then.
Can you elaborate on the issues you‚Äôve had creating shared frameworks?
Why not use timestamp of the request ? And reset next time 
What timestamp? What next time? I‚Äôm not sure what you are trying to say.
Why are they missing from the response? If they are missing at that time, does it matter? Surely if they come back later on, you can still create an object later and store it
You have to delete all entities slnknother way. You can also just delete whole data file and create it again. But if you want to distinguish between your responses you can set the initial timestamp (unix time) and compare it to the next time and that way to reset it your value to 0 between restarts or whatever is your logic. 
Does it allow me to share classes between multiple targets because this is what I‚Äôm looking for :) Anyways, bookmarked, it looks really good! Thanks for sharing!
Thanks, Ah, yah not sure if that works with video, or live video at that, but perhaps they‚Äôve made some of the functionality available to developers, I‚Äôll try to find out. 
So basically, before you parse you fetch all current items, parse new items, compare lists and delete/ save as necessary ?
Or just parse new, batch delete where stock = 0
Hmm you can batch delete entity based on a predicate condition, but not a variable, you would have to fetch all items, parse new items into array, then map the full list where new items doesn‚Äôt contain and then filter that array to set the var to 0
Ugh. I suppose I could do that. Is there really no way to batch set properties? That seems like a major failing of something like this.
It takes the place of a normal request so build it and do context.request
Wat?
Fabric Events is probably the fastest way to achieve what you want without a lot of legwork. Remember to be GDPR compliant :)
We've used Xcode since 2003 so a lot of our opinions are based on problems we had years ago and just never revisited. For building frameworks, we originally had problems with the framework location - it had to be specified as a full path, not a partial path. Mach-O was really idiotic compared to CFM on the Mac. This was fixed a long time ago. Then we had problems with header files either not being found or not being included in the framework. Frameworks didn't always rebuild if you modified a source file because target dependencies were kinda messed up. And you had to copy the framework once built into the right place within the bundle for it to be used. And source code debugging was flaky for a few years as well. &amp;#x200B; We just gave up on it because frameworks, while conceptually fine, just didn't buy us anything in practice. We put the source code for a given module in a folder, include the source files in whatever project we need, and build. Simple. Five minutes of work. If certain apps didn't need the entire framework, they could selectively include which files they needed. &amp;#x200B; The only real advantages you get by using a framework are: 1. That you get to include one big thing in new projects instead of several little things (no big deal) 2. The code can be shared between application and extension, saving system memory (this can actually be a big deal and is a good reason to use frameworks). 
So if I have this correct. This is similar to a store app. The API is updating the amount of stock on a product. If the product is not in the API response, then the value should be assumed as 0? If I am correct or not, you should look into [batch updates](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/featuredarticles/CoreData_Batch_Guide/BatchUpdates/BatchUpdates.html) If I have a correct understanding, you could pass in as the predicate a list of ids *not in* then set the properties to update to be whatever you want. In this case ‚Äúquantity = 0‚Äù This will allow for less of a performance hit but still give you what you are looking for.
Thanks, but I already got to that in a different comment thread. I'm resetting everything before calling the API, rather than comparing ID values. &amp;#x200B; [https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/9jqj76/resetting\_coredata\_values\_between\_executions/e6tpi7g](https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/9jqj76/resetting_coredata_values_between_executions/e6tpi7g)
i will do it later once i understand the problem
Same, but if different directions is easier or more efficient I‚Äôm fine with that.
Implement "to the screen"?? What?
You should put some screenshots or gifs in your read me. 
I just don't know the logic of typing only one character in the txtfield and then switch to the next txtfield. Instead of keyboard i want to use the number buttons. Just like the passcode lock in the iphone. 
Thank you I‚Äôll look into it !
Interesting repo man! Any plan to add Cocoapods / Carthage support in the future? 
You have to override draw when you subclass any UI class, if I'm not mistaken.
I subclassed a UIView, created a toggle Boolean state, when it changes I change the view‚Äôs background color animated ... üëåüèª
I have never overridden draw and I believe it‚Äôs bad to do so, I may be wrong though.
Not any concrete plans; it's a very small thing, and definitely something that I feel doesn't warrant pulling in as a dependency but fits the "drop and play" theme nicely :)
I chose to override draw to add the target. However, as someone else pointed out this can result in many targets being added, so I will probably fix this sooner rather than later, which will mean draw won't be overridden anymore :)
If you subclass a UIView without overriding draw, how do you do anything?
Yeah I believe you can do it all in init or have a commonInit and call that from all the initializers.
This sums up what I‚Äôd say. 
Yeah, doing it in the constructors should be ok, alternatively you can addTarget when the button moves to the window (called didMoveToWindow) or something like that, just remember to remove the target when it‚Äôs removed from the window or somebody adding and removing the button to a view will end up having the same sort of issue as when it was in draw. (Obviously there‚Äôs also the didMoveToView functions / removeFromSuperview) 
Hey, man, these things take copy-paste skills like you wouldn't believe.
UIKit does things in draw that you aren‚Äôt aware of, when does UIKit call draw? What kinds of things do you want to do? Add subviews? Do everything in init.
? am I missing something üßê?
Doing *everything* in init negates the purpose of a UIView. draw is there for you to manipulate the way your view is displayed. You don't put so-called "business logic" in there, but it's there for helping dictate how your view is drawn. Seems pretty self-explanatory to me.
Highlighted is the the finger down state you are thinking of. Selected is a state you set programmatically (they can also be combined, and have a totally unique appearance for the possible state combinations - that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs the methods on UIButton that ask for control state when setting images et al)
Ah, silly me. I‚Äôll try to come up with ways this could extend upon that behavior, to set it apart from your standard UIButton! Thanks for the info :)
I guess we have to agree to disagree 
Thanks for the suggestion! However, I already fixed this by doing it in the initializer :)
Excellent ;)
&gt; 2011 MacBook can‚Äôt run Mojave :( Why? It should be more than good enough.
Have you never written your own view?
Thank yuo that already helps me think about it better. Also did not even think to check for a spritkit thread so thanks again!
also thank mr skeltal for good bones and calcium[^*](https://www.reddit.com/r/tmsbmeta/)
I disagree and so do the docs... Not only is it a performance hit, draw can be called anytime the view is invalidated and in most cases you don‚Äôt need to redraw the view. 9/10 my subclasses add subviews and add constraints. And if something needs to be changed when invalidated, I use layoutSubviews. The only time I‚Äôve ever overridden `draw` is when drawing paths (waveforms for instance).
fwiw, carthage is dead simple. Create a framework target and share the scheme. Of course you need to set access control appropriately as well.
What do people *think* I'm saying? I certainly don't recommend doing what OP did, but there are valid and not uncommon reasons to override draw ‚Äî that is, when you want to override the way the view is *drawn* ‚Äî as you mention in your last sentence.
You specifically said, ‚Äòyou have to override draw when subclassing,‚Äô which is not always the case.
Yeah, I get my SDKs crossed sometimes. I thought it was required in a mandatory way, as it is in other places. The conversation turned to a different direction after that, though, and I'm confused.
Well I'm the queen of all bananas.
I‚Äôm sure you can teach me about bananas and a ton about iOS in general by no means am I a good programmer, more of a lucky programmer.
Yes. You can find regencies to them in the WWDC materials for CoreML.
How long did it take till you were able to be proficient at coding
I‚Äôm far from proficient, just learning. You said you prefer to learn by doing and HwS has that approach. 
&gt;forward walking sprite sequence So how would I better define to find examples of seeming like the user is walking forward things appearing in front of them? Not "walking forward" by moving left to right like a lot of games and what shows up when you search "walking forward" within the spritekit / swift context
If you want to be able to work from home ultimately, it might be in your best interest to try to learn a language that has a bigger demand for remote work such as JavaScript. There are far more remote job opportunities working with web frameworks like angular and react. If you aren't incredibly tied to swift I would recommend hopping on udemy and picking up a few js and angular/react courses. If you are really tied to swift I had a good experience with this online course https://www.udemy.com/devslopes-ios11/learn/v4/ back when I was working in swift. It's a little older but I think for the most part it would still be a good resource. Good luck with your learning, it's a lot of work and a lot of fun. I hope it goes well!
Yeah swift and JavaScript on the MacBook is totally viable many of the tutorials you purchase on udemy or tutorials on YouTube will walk you through how to setup a development environment and install the appropriate tools you will need to develop with. Nowadays most of all development environments can be setup on a Mac or PC so don't worry about being restricted to certain programming languages/frameworks etc. 
Great thanks for the info. I‚Äôm very interested in learning how to write code but had no idea where to start. 
If you look at the tutorials out there, you see a whole lot of "type what I type and we'll call that learning". I'm really beginning to hate the "type what I type" videos. No programmer needs to watch another programmer type. Most of them also go thru the whole layout of the app. They drag and drop buttons, VC and everything else, they have you watch as they line everything up, only to find out the tutorial was only 2 min of a 1/2 hour video... All the rest was "watch me type" and watch me layout the screens. Try this guy: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbTw29mcP12YlTt1EpUaVJw He talks fast and he's starting to use a typing speed up routine in his video so you don't have to watch him type. The other thing that might help is to start making cheat sheets, make step by step cheat sheets for common things.
That‚Äôs one reason I downloaded the playgrounds app because it allowed me to design my own code and visually see where the mistakes I made were. The fact that it was designed as a game is what drew me to it and swift in general. I‚Äôm a visual person so being able to see how the code I write controls something physical and shows me the mistakes I make is helpful. So if there is any tips to remember how to properly use functions and loops etcetera would be helpful. 
I learned by using APIs. After learning the basics and how to work with arrays, just build something half complex. You make mistakes and learn from them. Sometimes it takes a few hours or many days to solve something. Google is your friend and the results on stack overflow are your answers. 
I‚Äôm completely new to this can you explain a couple of things What is arrays? and what is stack overflow?
Well it‚Äôs one review per version. So version 1.0 (1) will be reviewed, but if you make cha gets to your app and end up with 1.0 (2) it won‚Äôt be reviewed. Also, review times for me (for TestFlight) are under 24 hours, not much time wasted 
wow, you're that new. You'll learn what an array is really quick cause it's like a fundamental concept, but stack overflow is where programmers go to look up solutions for their programming conceptual problems. The answers there are very specific and accurate for whatever issue is at hand. https://stackoverflow.com I would recommend reading a programming book to start off or a coding website like code academy. Even a part time intro to programming course would help a lot.
I understand that I have a long ways to go before I can do anything that will be meaningfully useful. But for me I enjoy solving puzzles and I know that writing code is solving a puzzle and creating one at the same time and that is what interests me the most. Having aspergers is something that I know will make the task I need to learn hard but at the same time if I commit to something I can gain the experience it just takes me a little longer and requires a lot more repetition but lucky for me I have OCD as well so I guess that‚Äôs a silver lining üòÇ. The thing for me is I am looking to gain a useful skill that might take me longer to learn but is something I can use to improve myself and gain more independence. I‚Äôm thankful for all the tips. 
~~Well, you get a male platform and you get a female platform. And you control breed them.~~ I don't know.
That‚Äôs done on your server. It‚Äôs got nothing to do with cross platform. Your phrasing makes it sound like you want to build one app to run on multiple platforms. Your API should be platform agnostic, it doesn‚Äôt need to none if a user if on iOS or Android. 
Ok thank you, I knew I was being confusing so thank you for understanding! 
Yes, there's tutorials out there for this, in fact, it's pretty much the only way to go. There's a flower image tutorial floating around that i did earlier this year. IIRC, you have to do some conversion.
I bought a course with UDEMY, and honestly I can say it‚Äôs the most in-depth thing I have worked with. Admittedly I have written an app before, so can skip through some bits as I already know them. With the course you learn to build 20 fully working apps, use playgrounds, understand everything about using APIs, playgrounds, Stack Overflow, Git Hub, servers... the list goes on. The good thing about the course is it doesn‚Äôt just tell you what you have to write, it tells you what everything is in great detail! I work 6-10 hours a day learning from it and upgrading my app. If you‚Äôre a complete beginner I would recommend this course, wish someone had told me about it a while ago! They‚Äôve just released a new iOS 12 course (I‚Äôm still working through the iOS11 course at the moment). But I believe there‚Äôs a sale on at the moment, so the full course is ¬£11.99 to my recollection. You absolutely will not regret it! The teachers name is Angela Yu and she is very particular and sounds perfect for you, doesn‚Äôt just tell you what to do, she teaches you how to do it for yourself from the very first line of code + gives you challenges along the way. (Then guide throughs if you couldn‚Äôt manage it)
But you are talking about training new model or converting existing one with CreateML to make it smaller?
That tutorial was converting one. I'm no expert, but my guess is that if you want to train an ML on your device, it's going to be slow and take a long time to have the power you get from the ones that are already done.
Here's the link to the tutorial: https://www.udemy.com/ios-11-app-development-bootcamp/ It's called Whatflower. I don't remember everything, but i'm pretty sure it imports the model. I don't remember if it was that one or another one that had to be converted first, but it wasn't all that hard either way. I'm not sure yet, how to add to a model. I'm still using the older version and I guess it doesn't learn. I'm working on updating my system.
I've recreated the situation and it seems to work. Just to make sure, I'm logging the thread. My code, abbreviated: @objc func refreshAction() { NSLog("Current thread: %@", Thread.current) NotificationCenter.default.post(name: NSNotification.Name(rawValue: "disableAction"), object: nil) } @objc func disableAction() { NSLog("Current thread: %@", Thread.current) if let items = self.tabBar.items, let last = items.last { last.isEnabled = !last.isEnabled } } override func viewDidLoad() { self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = UIBarButtonItem(barButtonSystemItem: .refresh, target: self, action: #selector(refreshAction)) } override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) { super.viewDidAppear(animated) NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(disableAction), name: NSNotification.Name(rawValue: "disableAction"), object: nil) } Minor observation: on my machine, the "as? [UITabBarItem]" produces a warning and can be removed.
Thanks I‚Äôll take a look at the course you suggested and it‚Äôs nice to see there is a community willing to help me out. Thanks again for the info. 
[https://github.com/cruisediary/Gradients](https://github.com/cruisediary/Gradients)
Thanks for mentioning the Cmd-0 and Cmd-option-0! 
That‚Äôs very encouraging! Everyone else at work got a second monitor, and yeah it‚Äôd be nice to have an extra,but I haven‚Äôt felt the need for it. Then I started spending more time with my 12‚Äù MacBook until I really need more real estate. 
That‚Äôs the idea, and I‚Äôm trying this out and see if it‚Äôs doable. So far so good!
Is that sarcastic? Lol I‚Äôm honestly lucky they‚Äôve supported it as long as they did. When I think about loading the newest windows os onto a 7 year old pc I kind of throw up. 
Take a look at the Photos framework, specifically PHPhotoLibrary, PHAssetChangeRequest, and PHAssetCollectionChangeRequest. Here‚Äôs a link to the framework docs with more info and examples: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit
Thanks great work! 
Another nice source of simple to follow and shorts tutorials is the blog ioscreator.com, you will need some swift and iOS programming knowledge, its a nce source when you completed the playgrounds tuts
Ok now I‚Äôm glad that someone got to that I‚Äôm trying to decide if I should focus on if I want to make mobile apps or desktop apps. Is the principle the same just tailoring the same language to one or the other?
Mostly yes, if your are talking about code apps for iOS/MacOS/TvOS/WatchOS, language principles are the same, API/SDK usage change
As someone new what is the easiest to start on. I have a strong interest in iOS apps so I‚Äôm leaning that way right now. But if it‚Äôs easier to learn API/SDK and then work on iOS I would go that route. What can you recommend 
Thank you! Great question I promise I'll update here [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/turushan/Swifty42/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) asap, but I can answer here for now. 1) If you're convinced about a new helpful recommendation for an unlisted topic: you can fork repo, create a branch, add your recommendation and submit a pull request. 2) If you need a recommendation for an unlisted repo you can create an issue on Github and just ask, another one or me will answer and add that recommendation to main list. 3) If you think you know a better recommendation for a listed topic both creating issue for a discussion or pull request about that is also welcome.

Yeah, I wish I'd known when I had my MacBook Air! I got the 2016 15" MBP when it came out, but even with the 15", it's useful for when you use Interface Builder.
This makes sense for some things, mostly around code: "how do I do X?" could feasibly be answered with a single result. Sure, that approach might not end up being the right one, but at least it gives folks a clear place to start. However, for blogs, newsletters, podcasts, conferences, and anything else where there can be no single answer, I'm not sure how useful this approach is.
great effort
working for equity?
DM me with more details if possible
Is there $ involved ?
I might be interested, "might" because I'm currently not hooked up on any side project and secondly it depends on the type of idea. You can message me.
Sure, what are you paying per hour?
Look at the process class for swift. You can execute any other program using it, just as you could launch them from a terminal.
Well i meant iOS/MacOS API/SDK, first you should learn the language but more important is lear to solve problem using code, this is like learn to speak, after you know how to speak you will be able to learn any world language, you are in the right track use playgrounds to learn to solve problems with code, then you can move into code iOS Apps, for that you will need to study the related API/SDK and how iOS Apps works, you may learn a lot by looking at examples, youtube is full of them if you like me prefer see how it is made than follow written instructions
Wow, I see a Paul Hudson feedback to my repo üò≤ respects üôåüèº I agree with you for some points, for example I'm planning to give two recommendations for weekly newsletter, first one is a video formatted one from Sean Allen and I'm trying to choose a mail/text formatted, giving ten newsletters may be useless because they have mostly common announcements, so two will be enough here based on format video &amp; text. Conferences are already with multiple recommendations because of different event dates &amp; locations. When we come to blog &amp; podcast, one may not be enough for a podcast/blog lover, you can consume the weekly content in 30-60 mins, and rest of the week what will you listen/read? On the other hand I don't want to give thirty recommendations (here the point is, I don't want to push users to choose/search for better one between options, I want them just take the recommendation and move), but I will find magic recommendation numbers for blog &amp; podcast. &amp;#x200B;
Sure, send me a message plz.

I‚Äôm interested. Please send me a message.
You can even run swift scripts. I wrote a swift script few days ago.
What exactly are you trying to do with the image URL? You can just save it to the file system and transmit it from there.
How would I do that and if I save it to the file system is there a way for me to encrypt it?
You would have to make use of Apple's encryption API. There's quite a bit about security you need to read up to do it correctly.
You don't "convert an image to a URL". You encode it as data that can be transported to another location.
You could use githuv gists. It also gives you the benefit of making them public.
Wish I was in that situation - stuck using it for work.
I presume what you‚Äôre doing is pushing a new view controller onto the stack. Which has no ‚Äòstate‚Äô. What you want is to either: - tell that new view controller what it‚Äôs ‚Äòstate‚Äô should be - or; ‚Äòpop‚Äô (if your segue is a push) or ‚Äòdismiss‚Äô (if your segue is a modal) the second vc
Hydem has give a pretty straightforward answer. You could just dismiss the second VC. But if you go ahead with the first option of giving it a state, and are confused as to how to do that, then maybe this answer could be for you. I'm gonna guess you have a data structure in your first VC which saves the user input in the textField. If not, you should. While you're segueing from 2 to 1, have a prepare for segue block in VC2, get the VC1 object with segue.destination and assign the state of the VC1 by assigning that data structure object to it we talked about in the first para. 
You don't. A URL is an address of a certain format, a UIImage is a set of data that represents a graphic image. It's like saying I need to create a rock from water, it just not how it works. You might want to look up a tutorial on uploading images to a web site. Here's one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1vrjt7Nvb0
iPhone X?
I think I understand optionals. What really gets me is the amount of tutorials based on older Swift, which is really frustrating, coupled with trying to find answers to questions specifically for MacOS apps. I'm not advanced enough to be able to follow the dozens of iOS tutorials and apply the knowledge to MacOS yet.

Optionals are values that might have a value or might be nil. A question mark means you're passing an optional value somewhere. But if you have a piece of code that uses the value you're gonna have to "unwrap" your optional. So there are different methods to get the value out safely, and you can decide what to do after you get the value or you find a nil. Do try is for error throwing, don't worry about that part. Look into methods of unwrapping optionals. "!" Is just the least safe method of unwrapping, it's just saying force out whatever was in there. That's dangerous though, and only used in real code when you're sure you have something because if you ever unwrap a nil value your app will crash.
Maybe you'd benefit from a brief chat with another developer. I'd be happy to talk to you on Skype to help give a hands-on demo of how optionals work, if you'd like ‚Äì no charge, of course :)
&gt; Or the fact that one tutorial doesn't use optionals, but as soon as you start typing it into XCode, it bitches that it needs ? or !. So I pick one, fuck-it I am trying to learn. But then XCode is like "Hold-up, optionals are not used here." &gt; WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK? &gt; So I move on to a different tutorial. Because that frustrated the fuck out of me. Great, a Swift 4 tutorial. XCode says, "Hold-up, You need to update the language to 4.2 You want me to do that for you?" Sure! Sounds great! "Hold-up, optional chaining isn't used here." Can you link to some of these tutorials so we can see what the actual issues are?
I hear you. The language changes a lot which makes its hard for people trying to learn it. A lot of the time when you see a swift error in Xcode you can click it and ‚Äúfix it‚Äù automatically. So there‚Äôs that. 
There haven't been many breaking changes since the Swift 2 -&gt; 3 migration. Unless you're watching pre-Swift 3 tutorials, I'm sure they aren't "completely outdated".
The best place to start learning is swift.org where everything is always updated. https://swift.org/documentation/#the-swift-programming-language
First of all, from one guy who gets too excited and has been known to make inflammatory posts like this to another, let‚Äôs take a chill pill. Firstly, Swift is an infant compared to PHP, ObjC, C#. If you think they are done changing things you‚Äôve assumed wrong. It‚Äôs an open source language, so if you‚Äôre going to yell at someone, yell at everyone making merge requests for it when they find a way to improve the syntax or functionality or readability. Getting frustrated over tutorials that are out of date: ya, I will admit this is frustrating. But that‚Äôs the life, ya know? Sometimes you get lucky and Xcode automatically suggests the updated code, sometimes you gotta keep searching. I don‚Äôt find that to be unique to swift at all, I‚Äôm my experience. I recently wrote my first iPhone app, and this was my first experience with swift. I have training in C++, Python, java and more, and jumping right in to a swift project with barely any knowledge of the syntax was actually relatively very easy to me. It should be even more so for you coming from an objective c background, whereas swift is based on that language. Yeah a lot of the tutorials I borrowed from had outdated code. 90% of the time the solution is just one additional google search away. The entire point of swift is to be streamlined and as easy as possible to read, interpret, and use. It will continue to be updated to that end. I still don‚Äôt understand the optionals but I got through it and hacked together an app that does exactly what I set out to do. If you lack determination, software development isn‚Äôt for you. These are opportunities to learn, not obstacles. It‚Äôs the fastest growing language worldwide. I‚Äôd say you better get familiar. Don‚Äôt give up. You can do it. Kids are doing it. It‚Äôs all good brother/sister. Deep breath. YouTube is your fiend. Next time you feel like watching TV put on some videos about swift development. There are thousands. I‚Äôm going to go watch one right now on optionals. 
In a lot of applications it makes more sense to crash than operate in an unintended state. But I agree that for beginners this is mostly confusing though.
That's why I said there are cases where it's useful. However, they are rare and should be used very carefully. There's far too much abuse of forced-unwrapping, implicit-unwrapping, and ignoring exceptions. People often do it to avoid handling things properly and then wonder why their program crashes so much.
I'm with you here and fail to see how optionals add any value. Most people will say don't use the forced unwrapping (!) and go with ? so now you have a variable that might contain something or not - so aren't you back to square one having to check if it's nil? Other than some syntactic sugar that let's you check more easily in one line what's the point?
I think the key thing to remember about optionals is that ‚Äì despite the shorthand `?` and `!` syntax, they are actually another type. Specifically, they're an enum defined as: enum Optional &lt;T&gt; { case some(T) case none } So as you can see, an Optional can be one of two values, `none` which contains nothing, and `some` which contains a wrapped type `T`. (The `T` in angled brackets means its generic, which means we can have an `Optional` contain *any* type we want ‚Äì Optional &lt;Int&gt;, Optional &lt;String&gt;, Optional &lt;MyCrazyClass&gt; ‚Äì whatever. Some people find it helpful to think of these kind of types as 'boxes' ‚Äì because they wrap another type of some kind. At they're root they are just standard enums ‚Äì If you understand what an enum can do you understand what an Optional type can do. (Swift enums are pretty powerful.) What can be confusing is that as Optional is a type used so heavily throughout the language, Swift includes shorthand for Optionals such as the `?` and `!' operators ‚Äì strictly you don't need this kind of syntactic sugar to work with them though ‚Äì and in fact I think it's helpful to understand how you'd work without the sugar so you can really understand them For example, any type which is followed by a question mark `T?` could also be written as `Optional &lt;T&gt;`. Let's take a method which takes an optional Int (`Optional &lt;Int&gt;` or `Int?`) and doubles it and write it using regular enum syntax: func doubleBoxedInt(_ boxedInt: Optional &lt;Int&gt;) -&gt; Optional &lt;Int&gt; { guard case let .some(unboxedInt) = boxedInt else { // the box was empty, return empty box return .none } // we have the unboxed value, double it and return the value doubled and boxed return .some(unboxedInt * 2) } In their wisdom though, the designers of Swift thought that might become tiresome so they added a bit of sugar so that an `Optional &lt;T&gt;` could be represented as a `T?` and also some magic so that if an optional is expected somewhere, the compiler will wrap the value in a `some()` on your behalf. It also allows an 'unboxing' with a simple `if let` or`guard let`, and of course `nil` is synonymous with `.none`. So that the above can be written as: func doubleBoxedInt(_ boxedInt: Int?) -&gt; Int? { guard let unboxedInt = boxedInt else { // the box was empty, do nothing return nil } // we have the unboxed value, double it and return return (unboxedInt * 2) } The important thing to remember is that an optional is an Optional &lt;T&gt;. And an Optional &lt;T&gt; is an enum. Understand enums, and you understand Optionals.
Hi there, currently we don't offer remote positions for iOS Engineers (I'd be the first to take advantage of this üòÜ)
Optionals are just like obj-c pointers...they might be nill and if you don't check you might crash your app. But swift _forces_ you to check and gives you some nicer syntax to checks and keep track of what you've already checked. And optionals haven't changed since swift2 except for minor improvements like more slightly more flexible if lets, so your optional trouble are not a swift version thing they're a swift thing. Here's basically everything you need to know about optionals, with descriptions, and obj-c translations. var foo: Foo? // an optional Foo. You will have to deal with the optionality // Foo *foo var foo: Foo! // an implicitly unwrapped optional Foo. You won't have to deal with the optionality in the rest of your code, but you better populate it before you use it or crash. // Foo *foo foo?.bar() // if foo is nil that's OK, just don't do anything after the ? //[foo bar]; foo!.bar() // if foo is nil crash //assert(foo != nil); [foo bar]; //try to make a new foo that isn't optional and shadows the old optional one inside this block if let foo = foo { foo.bar() } // if (foo != nil) { // [foo bar]; // } //try to make a new foo that isn't optional and shadows the old optional one for the rest of this method guard let foo = foo else { return } foo.bar() // if (foo == nil) { return; } // [foo bar]; let baz = foo ?? getAnotherFoo() //baz will be the first one that's not nil(and optional or not depending on whether getAnotherFoo returns a Foo or a Foo?) // Foo* baz = foo ?: getAnotherFoo() That's pretty much all you need to know about optionals. They can be annoying at first but they drive you to write better code by pushing dependencies into init methods, trying to eliminate optionals that shouldn't really be optional, and making it clear what can and can't be nill. Oh and this has nothing to do with try catch(there is try? but that's really a rarely used tangent)
You're going to have to explain a lot more. First of all, do you have any programming experience at all? Because this isn't a Swift question, it's a general-programming one. Linear game? 2D? 3D? What kind of play area are you talking about? Generally, what you do is every object in your game is mapped in such a way that it's close to other ones nearby. A tree-type of structure works well for this, objects on the same branch of the tree tend to be close together in the play area. To expand the play area you further branch the tree.
Same situation, my case is worst because my Objective-C background is zero. But despite the frustrations I enjoy when I can solve something, but because of lack of good non outdated examples I will expend more time to learn that I though....
I was able to solve: let colname = String(cString: sqlite3\_column\_origin\_name(Statement, i)!) &amp;#x200B;
Read the Swift book on the Apple iBooks app. It's always up to date.
Sure thing! So this is totally 2d, sandbox game being played from an overhead perspective, think something along the lines of Sim City.
The player interacts with the game through a mouse and keyboard (there isn't a character on screen), and background is something simple, like a chalkboard.
Yes, in the beginning I found it hard. But once you know more, I think which is a good thing to avoid crush.
Thanks for the reply. Cheers
Is there any way/app to get gists when you're offline? I use to check my notes on my commute
You said you are experienced in Objective-C. So maybe this will help: var prop1: AClass? var prop4: AStruct? Think of these as pointers. They can be nil. var prop2: AClass! var prop5: AStruct! Think of these as pointers that could be nil, but the compiler will crash if you try to send a message while it's nil. IE, it's dangerous. var prop3: AClass Think of this as a pointer that cannot be nil. var prop 6: AStruct Think of this as a normal variable holding the value directly.
So, what‚Äôs not working for you exactly?
I think the secret to understanding optional is understand why they exist in the first place. Trying to push through a tutorial by just copy/pasting or typing the exact code without understanding how they work will left you confused. Optionals are invented to let us handle 'nil' at ease. If the variable can contain nil value, its type must be accompanied by `?` , eg: `String?`. `if let a = b` is equivalent to if b != nil { a = b! } The `try catch` is a bit more complicated, you use a try-catch block when the function might throw an error during runtime (eg: the JSONDecoder function will throw an error is the JSON input is invalid). `let car = try? JSONDecoder().decode(Car.self, from: data)` will return a car object if the JSON data is successfully parsed. If the JSON data is invalid, an error will be thrown from the .decode function, then `try?` will ignore the error and assign a nil value to car. `try?` is used when you don't care about the error handling. I have written an explanation on [Optionals](https://fluffy.es/eli-5-optional/) and [Difference between Try, Try? and Try!](https://fluffy.es/difference-between-try/) if you are interested, hope this helps solve your frustration! 
I use SnippetLab but only run in macOS (no iOS App for now). Another option for iOS and macOS is use Bear app
Thank you, 'dismiss' did exactly what I needed easily
&gt; I'm with you here and fail to see how optionals add any value Lol... /// If we Have a URL for this object's image if let hasRemoteImageURL = thisObject.optionalURL { thisCell.image.loadRemoteImage(url: hasRemoteImageURl) /// else use placehoder } else { thisCell.image = #UIPlaceholder } Alternatively optional chaining can be quite useful if let isExpired = YourAppState.userSession.authToken?.isExpired, !isExpired { /// User is Logged in } else { /// User is Logged out or doesn't have a token } Also, typing code in reddit SUCKS
I‚Äôm a learner of swift as well. I do like optional BUT it annoys me that I have to make everything optional when using Storyboards/segues. I mean, my ViewController is useless without my vars set, but since I don‚Äôt have control over the initialization I have to make them optional. Sure I can probably instantiate them manually and not use segues but that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs taught in the ‚ÄúLearn Swift‚Äù stuff... My point is that all these unnecessary optional makes it confusing and annoying so a lot of beginners probably just slap ! on everything and call it a day. 
I feel your pain. I've been using it for several months and it does not get much easier. If you need to do anything new - expect to spend between hours and days searching unfruitfully for an answer. The community is poorly developed and anything beyond very simplistic questions receive zero response. Curiously, there is an abundance of people claiming to be swift experts, yet none of them are answering any community questions beyond beginner difficulty. If you're messing with it just to learn something new, I'd seriously suggest looking elsewhere. There are a lot of cross-platform engines available now that bypass the need to muck about in swift. I personally did not have a choice in the matter. I needed low level access that cross platform environments with high level languages don't offer.
As a former employee of one of these places, am I allowed to comment on how I feel about said company?
Bear was my first option before Quiver but I'm not sure I can preview markdown code blocks into the notes unless you export them. Has it changed? 
Hahahaha feel free
You can't tell the network request to finish first. Its async and finishes after your serial queue ```navigateConfirmed()```. What you can do is put the navigateConfirmed() inside the completion handler for your network request. So ONCE the data is ready and you get the 0 response code, then you can use navigateConfirmed() with that response code.
First thing you CAN do this however in my experience it is very finicky. I'm doing this now on a work project. So what you need to do is include the swift header file in the obc-c file you wish to work on. This is not to be confused with the bridging header you made to go from objc to swift. This is a hidden file that xcode handles for you. It will be called {projectName}-Swift.h. If you changed your project name during the course of the project you are going to run into problems as sometimes this doesn't update. Note you may get errors or warnings that the file cannot be found do a clean and then build and it should go away. Also note any function you want to have access in swift must have @objc in front of it. Otherwise you will not be able to call it inside objc. Lastly in an objc file you can not write the code as swift when you call the function you need to write it how you would call an objc method but it will call your swift code. That is it. It isn't really hard but the finicky nature of it makes it a pain and sometimes you just have to fight through it and trust that you are doing it right. I hope this helps. If you have any questions or if something I said was unclearly I will do my best to help.
Great explanation. I remember the first time I did this and it took forever to import that file. My project named used to be ‚ÄúProjectA‚Äù and was renamed to ‚ÄúProjectB‚Äù. So the import header for ObjC was actually ‚ÄúProjectA-Swift.h‚Äù. Very annoying. I believe if you have a space in the project name it would be converted to an underscore (‚ÄúProject_A-Swift.h‚Äù).
Please use code formatting, I can't read that. 
umm why not git? What do you think is going to happen to the cloud? Dissipate? If you really wanted another backup id probably use a external HDD, it's what I use for projects i don't work on anymore... 1+ year old
&gt; They all got the Main.storyboard and LaunchStoryboard error..? They did or didn't they? Why are you asking us if they have the error. We don't know.
I‚Äôm not familiar with Git. I plan to learn it soon. Although right after created this post I did make a Git account and uploaded my project there. Regardless, why is the case that main study board file and launch story board file don‚Äôt work properly when downloaded form google drive?
They did. Why being rude? 
Honestly, probably just some misconfiguration when uploaded to Google Drive, they probably to something in the background to compress file size or something, just learn to use GIT and use that, if you ever want a job in software and you tell them you use google drive, you'll be quickly booted out the door before you can even finish the word "drive"
Ah i see. Thanks. Although I‚Äôm a Civil Engineer you see. But I‚Äôll learn Git. :)
I'd say, do a diff of a working and a corrupted storyboard file. Then you'll see what went wrong. Storyboard files are simply XML (text) files.
I did make a different storyboard for both Main and LaunchScreen. I got no errors but the simulator got stuck with just a white screen on displaying no errors on the console.
Apple call it iPhone 10 tho
diff? 
You can call `@objc`-annotated methods from Objective-C(++) through classes, which you probably know about. Additionally, you can use the `@_cdecl` attribute on functions to provide an implementation for a function with a given name. For instance: ```swift @_cdecl("foo_bar") func foo(bar: Int) -&gt; Int { return bar * bar } ``` and then in your C file: ```c NSInteger val = foo_bar(4); // 16 ``` Although underscored attributes are technically private, I recall Apple's Joe Groff saying that just about the only reason it isn't public is that it hasn't been through the evolution process, so it could get a slightly different syntax. It is otherwise fully functional.
This is a very simple implementation of the same.. You may make the button circular or add any design changes, but that was out of the scope of this example. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **class** ViewController: UIViewController { **override** **func** viewDidLoad() { **super**.viewDidLoad() **let** button = CustomButton() **self**.view.addSubview(button) button.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = **false** button.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: **self**.view.topAnchor, constant: 50).isActive = **true** button.leftAnchor.constraint(equalTo: **self**.view.leftAnchor, constant: 20).isActive = **true** button.setTitle("Click Here", for: .normal) button.setTitleColor(.black, for: .normal) button.addTarget(**self**, action: **#selector**(toggleAction(sender:)), for: .touchUpInside) } **@objc** **func** toggleAction(sender: CustomButton){ sender.selectedFlag.toggle() **if** sender.selectedFlag{ sender.backgroundColor = .green } **else** { sender.backgroundColor = .clear } } } **class** CustomButton: UIButton{ **var** selectedFlag = **false** }
So how is this better than if thisObject.optionalURL == nil { thisCell.image = #UIPlaceholder } else { thisCell.image.loadRemoteImage(url: hasRemoteImageURl) }
1 - Add #import &lt;ProjectName&gt;-Swift.h to the top of the .m file you want to call the swift function from 2 - Clean your project, delete derived data, clean your project, restart xcode, restart your mac, clean your project until it works 3 - Eventually it will work 4 - Eventually it will break too, just repeat step 2 again
This is awesome!
It sounds like what you want to do is identify all images of cars in your library. I believe this is possible as you could pass each path of any image file to CoreML to identify the image content, in this case ‚Äúcar‚Äù. I‚Äôm not sure about how things will be handled with the variety of file types you listed, but .jpgs and .pngs would be fine. You could even possibly train a new image classifier model to identify the exact type of car that you‚Äôre trying to identify within your images.
Just asking a clarifying question: Do you mean to identify the car within the photo, not simply identifying there is a car in the photo? Eg. ‚ÄúThis is a 1967 Ford Mustang‚Äù vs ‚ÄúI haz car here!‚Äù MacOS (and iOS) has the latter one built in to Photos. It‚Äôs not 100 percent, but it shows at least something is possible.
nope. I want to identify locate the image I have in my library. Identify the image per se.
Nope. Here is an example from real life. Suppose I have photographed my car 10 years ago. At the time, I printed the picture and gave it to a friend of mine. Today, 10 years later, this friend gives me the picture and says, can you give me the original file of this picture? I have to locate that picture among 100K pictures. If I could simply locate it by scanning the picture and comparing it against all the pictures... but doing that by CoreML.
&gt;st f Thanks for your reply. Unfortunately, QuickLook only works for local resource files and I'm getting the data from an external resource (JSON Base64).
I'm not sure if this will affect the outcome? I've tried the other file types (PDF/PNG/JPEG) and experimenting with the character encoding, switching it around from "UTF-8", "Base64", and leave it as "". Character encoding seems to not affect the rendered view.
Did a quick google-fu and Support Articles suggest they are stored in Unicode as default.
Kind of confused on some parts. You say you include the header file but the error you get is that are part of the audiokit framework. Seems to me that the header file is being included but might have a conflicting method. Just odd you would get an error like that if it wasn't including it. Could be related even to including the foundation in your swift (Doubtful but sometimes you gotta start somewhere). I really feel that it is working for you but you are getting some other error you need to work through. In my experience I haven't ever needed to include swift in the header file of an objc so I can't really answer this. All my work has been in the methods file.
Right, but could you perhaps save it to a temporary file then load that?
Story of my life right here. Everytime I include the swift header file to another file I have to fight with it. Usually just a clean and a build but I have done that full number 2 just to get it to work before. 
I don't think a .doc can be rendered by WKWebView. How does it work on UIWebView? .doc is a binary file format - I didn't think any browser would render it.
Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. But I‚Äôm guessing this would introduce more loading time? 1st load time: Getting data from the server and downloading to a temp file. 2nd load time: Opening the temp file by the QuickLook? I came to this assumption because I have tested loading a local file and it takes a certain amount of time for that file to be fully displayed/rendered. 
Can you tell me more about this, i am working on a project with sfspeechrecognizer api and i run into some trouble. Is this similar to that ? 
So you want google's reverse image search against files on you Mac's hard disk?
&gt;t could you perhaps save it to a temporary file then load t Also, I've implemented this approach but the difference is, I've used WKWebview instead just to try it out. Step 1: Get data from JSON and save it locally Step 2: Load the saved local file as (URLRequest) to WKWebview This solution works but it feels a bit hacky and I'm just wondering why the native API is not behaving properly or am I just missing something.
&gt;/ It does work, WKWebview can render it from a local file. Just wondering why loading from a Data doesn't render it properly.
I was assuming that I just needed to use it in the methods file as well, but I wasn't sure if it needed to be in the .hpp instead (or also). I've no idea what I'm doing here in general. Just flailing. This is the same thing I ran into earlier - i assumed the information I found was incorrect or out of date, but it appears to be a different issue entirely, so I guess i need to solve this new issue first. It seems other people are having this issue as well and it may be a bug within swift. Haven't found an real answer yet. Regardless, thanks for the help!
Unicode is not a format. UTF-8 and UTF-16 are formats. For some retarded reason, Microsoft calls UTF-16 (or perhaps UCS-2) ‚ÄúUnicode‚Äù.
My mistake then. It's weird that they would switch the iPhone to roman numerals at the same time that they removed them from MacOS.
.doc is not a format all web browsers support. It‚Äôs not a bug by WKWebView, just not a feature. 
if that's what the customer wants, what can you do? displaying docs in Webviews isn't exactly optimizing for UX either
By ‚Äúbest‚Äù I think you mean ‚Äúpeople who live of their online profiles‚Äù. Nothing to do with their skills, IMO.
FileManager is used for manipulating files as singular entities. A file is best used for unstructured data. Most sorts of structured data would be better served by putting them in a database. There are, of course, exceptions to this but if you're reading tutorials on how to store data you are probably not in an exceptional situation. For structured data I'd suggest CoreData or some other database-y storage solution. Straight SQLite can be appropriate (via FMDB or some other adaptor) if you have experience with SQL or your data structure fits it better. Realm has a lot of advocates because it's simpler to understand than CoreData. I found their claims around multi-threading to be a bit over stated at launch, but I have no doubt that it's a capable environment.
Really excellent resource, thank you for sharing.
This is exactly what I was looking for and so simple! Thanks man! Do you by chance know the best way to receive this in C#? It looks like there is an Image data type but that is now out of date and I can't find the best thing to use for it. Maybe Byte?
I do not know where to start but Xcode 9 was IMO a total mess, with countless bugs and performance issues. I've reported 4 bugs, then I gave up. Why did I give up? Because I started to feel Apple does not care about us, the Developer Community, at all. For Apple, the Developer Community is nothing more than some impressive numbers to be stated in their fancy Keynotes and blog posts. With some break from mobile development as a whole, now I'm ready to give 10.0 a shot. 
It's not a bug. The screen size for iPhone apps running on iPads was 320x480 until iOS 12, now they've changed it to be the bigger size. The larger size doesn't retroactively apply to devices still running iOS 11 or lower.
most likely not, I recall checking "auto release". I could be wrong of course but I can't find that information anymore. If I check App Store Versions my initial release (v1.0) had "Pending developer release" before it said "Ready for sale". My current update which was approved early on the 29th just says "Ready for sale" after "In review".
Ive created a git repo on GitHub where I pull all my notes and how to's. I write them in markdown and edit them on Visual Studio Code. Gives me the benefit of turning them public and also available online/offline. It turned out to also be a great way to share knowledge with my team.
Even then, going to the AppStore ‚Äòs update page will show the update.
Faced the same thing a few days ago - just update price and then update it again. There is obviously bug in the ITC.
Here's what I did: I set the CanvasView bg color to black inside of its draw function. I figured that was appropriate due to the call to `setNeedsDisplay()` on its properties. I also figured it was appropriate because I'm thinking "how can I make this reusable?" If you want white drawing on a black background then setting the background should be in its draw function since that black background is a property of the view. Inside the `ViewController's` `undo` function I set `theCurve` to `nil` right before `removeLast()`. The reason I did that is because in the `draw` function you have some logic like `if theCurve != nil then draw`. Well that's a problem if you plan on undoing. You set theCurve = to the current curve once you finish drawing a line. You don't set this to `nil` *after* you add it to the collection on `CanvasCurve`. This means `theCurve = current curve` is still going to be around once you remove it from the curve collection and that's why it still shows up after you undo tl;dr : set `theCurve` to nil right before `removeLast` in the undo function. Also look into setting the `CanvasView` bg to black at the top of its `draw(rect:)` function 
interesting way. THANKS
yep
when i fill the employeeNameArray manually the cells are showing the data which means that the tableview implementation is fine

This makes very little sense. First of all, with `Codable` why bother creating your own system of encoding types? Write an appropriate encoder and every type can adhere to `Codable`. Secondly you‚Äôre stringifying all the things? You can simply use `JSONencoder` or `PropertyListEncoder` to get a stringified encoded type. Even better, `PropertyListEncoder` can write in a binary format, saving quite a bit of resources. Lastly, &gt; we can create a solution that doesn‚Äôt rely on an enum existing somewhere with a list of keys Wait, what?? Using an `enum` is a *good* thing. You want to be able to accurately and easily map keys to values. With an `enum` you reduce bugs by ensuring your serialization API is codified and solid. It also doesn‚Äôt prohibit you from using arbitrary dictionaries or arrays of values. Then, in the end, you create a complicated system of nested structures to hold your data when you could have just used ordinary model structures and `Codable`, avoiding a lot of boilerplate code for most operations. I don‚Äôt think this is a good example of modern Swift. Perhaps it was fine before `Codable` was introduced but it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôd recommend anyone follow now. 
In your viewDidAppear, it looks like: 1.) You didn't call super.viewDidAppear(animated) 2.) You are setting employeeNamesTblView.frame to itself. 
Share an instance of the same WKProcessPool for all WKWebViews by setting it in the WKWebViewConfiguration
I tried this by creating a WKProcessPool in a struct but I get an error when trying to access it to assign it to the configuration. I get EXC_BAD_ACCESS with code 2
Thank you for that. It helped somewhat. I included the #import for UIKit and that did work. However, I still receive errors for components of the AudioKit framework. Including audiokit in turn makes the compiler throw a ton of 'cannot find file' errors for the headers. Including those headers then of course lets xcode try to compile the framework, which throws a whopping 375 errors, all for 'no prototype' or 'cannot find interface'. The framework compiled fine before attempting to get this working. I think trying to include it screws up the include order and makes everything go sideways. However, without including the ProjectName-Swift.h, I cannot call swift from c.
thanks for helping
Yes, but I don't recommend it. Prefer swift solutions over ruby, keep them in the same repo if at all possible, and gherkins is pointless over complication(...unless product actually it....maybe?). I once worked on a project that used Ruby/Cucumber/Gherkin (via a now defunct project called Calabash) and it was pretty painful. Granted we had a separate ruby repo and dedicated automation engineers who wrote the ruby code, both of which greatly magnify the pain of trying to maintain a BDD suite in parallel with the app. Pretty sure you can you can still do that using Selenium in place of calabash, but unless management really has a _hard_ requirement that you be able to run common gherkin scripts against both iOS and android, I'd avoid it like the plague. 
What do you recommend for a Swift BBD framework then?
I'd do native unit tests. If you need more than that do Apple's native UI Testing. Apple's UI Tests should get you everything a BDD frameworks gives you except for the untyped english based adhoc syntax(Gherkin). If you need the gherkin layer(product is actually enthusiastically using it) then there are several options(XCTest-Gherkin, Cucumberish, etc) though I can't recommend one from personal experience. If product isn't using gherkin then just stick with UI Testing in real code. If you just need "some tests" and think that integration test are easier, I'd argue that they only look easier at first glance, and you should start with unit tests even if they're painful at first.
Update: I did what buffering suggested, an also included headers from the framework I added. As a result, xcode blew up with a ton of 'no prototype' and 'cannot find interface' errors.
I think the meat of the article was around type safe and convenient persistence not around creating your own system of encoding types. You could quite easily make Codable support StoredObject or even remove the StoredObject protocol and use Codable directly in any Storable&lt;T&gt; implementation. So if we ignore the encoding of types and just look at the persistence then the authors points about type safety, not having to use an Enum for this use case and being able to easily change where data is persisted are valid as: 1. you are defining your persistence as Storable&lt;T&gt; properties on a struct. 2. by conforming Storable to ExpressibleByStringLiteral you get some nice syntactic sugar for defining the key used to store the value against in the underlying persistence mechanism. There is also nothing I can see in this article that would prohibit you from persisting dictionaries, arrays of values or anything else. In fact the author shows the following in one of the code examples near the end: struct Utility { var graphData: RAMStorable&lt;[Graph.Body]&gt; = "u.graphData" }
This is what I find funny about this sub, everyone obviously agrees with you (your comment currently sits at 37) yet the post still has a high score :/
Awesome article man. 
Great article. Is there a place that details how to accomplish these different styles in the pics?
Post code in text instead of images. That way people can copy-paste it and work with it directly. It will make it easier for them to help you.
No but it would be nice if shit pots like this would get down voted off the front page. 
Mmm, I agree that this community should work harder in taking it back. It's really falling disarray of late.
Great article. Apple had wwdc session about it a while ago. https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/226 There is a pod which implements this called I think PSOperations which can help. We have a project where we use original Apples implementation it is pretty neat. But requires some learning. 
If you preface each line of code with 4 spaces it should format it properly.
Maybe I‚Äôm missing the descriptions. What are the distinctions between the 3 columns? Which are stock uikit vs custom classes? From left to right 
Keychain and UserDefaults should be used with single values or maybe an array but definitely not some kind of JSON blob stored away in string field. I don't necessarily agree with every statement or approach in the article but the idea of making storage to Keychain or UserDefaults basically a one-liner is great. I probably would explore using something like ClassName.varName as an automatic key and perhaps a mechanism to provide defaults. But cutting away this particular piece of boiler plate with pure expression of intent is great.
&gt; Keychain and UserDefaults should be used with single values or maybe an array but definitely not some kind of JSON blob stored away in string field. Sorry, I misread a bit of what the article is actually doing. Because it was using `ExpressibleByStringLiteral` I thought it was actually advocating turning the types into string representations and back. That's because: [`init(stringLiteral:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/expressiblebystringliteral/2294174-init) says &gt; Creates an instance initialized to the given string value. It's intended to be used to convert a string into an instance, just like the other Expressible types. What it's not intended to do is to serve as a key-lookup! For that you should use a regular `init` method, like: init(key: String) { self.key = value } Then the method call becomes: var infoiewDate = Storable&lt;Date&gt;(key: "t.viewDate.info") I don't know about you but that seems more clear than: var infoiewDate: Storable&lt;Date&gt; = "t.viewDate.info" Because you can plainly see the word "key" in the initializer. It's still a one-liner but it's self-documenting and simpler since you didn't have to adhere to an unnecessary and misleading protocol. But, for that matter, why are we doing any of this in the first place? import Foundation protocol StorageType { /* stub */ } class UserDefaultsStorage: StorageType { /* stub */ } class StorageEncoder { init(storage: StorageType) { /* stub */ } func encode&lt;T&gt;(_ value: T) where T : Encodable { /* stub */ } } class StorageDecoder { init(storage: StorageType) { /* stub */ } func decode&lt;T&gt;(_ type: T.Type) -&gt; T where T : Decodable { /* stub */ } } struct TabBar: Codable, Initable { var infoViewDate: Date } let tabBar = TabBar(infoViewDate: Date()) // save it let encoder = StorageEncoder(storage: UserDefaultsStorage()) encoder.encode(tabBar) // retrieve it let decoder = StorageDecoder(storage: UserDefaultsStorage()) let otherTabBar = decoder.decode(TabBar.self) This is the same pattern that all `Codable` types follow, you make an encoder and decoder and then use them to serialize and deserialize your types. You'll get any "primitive" types for free and you can build more complex ones from that. Look, no crazy strings at all. Not even for keys!

Neat tips 
Slightly related. If you want strongly typed access to UserDefaults and Codable support, check out my [`Defaults`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/Defaults) package.
Thanks, man!
Actually those components made as design system in Figma (www.figma.com) environment and already available as commercial product as early alpha
I wonder what this has to do with r/swift. I like the innocent question that's asks for the product. :D Thanks for your blogspam...
Nice article. It‚Äôs a shame they‚Äôre just Figma components rather than actual code. It‚Äôs often difficult to figure out how to override UIKit so examples would have been super helpful!
Does handoff in Figma make any sense how to export components styles properly into Swift?
I haven‚Äôt used Figma to export code unfortunately. I would imagine it would just create everything as UIViews and UILabels so you wouldn‚Äôt get the benefit of overriding Native components (eg. UINavigationBar or UIButton)
Is there any sketch or xd file?
I haven't looked at it yet, but how is this different than iOS dictation? I really don't have to time to read the code, I'm just wondering what it does above what iOS has built in? I'm guessing it's based on the stock IOS dictation system and makes some improvements on it.
https://blog.figma.com/introducing-figmas-first-api-challenge-53dba9b8292e according to this announcement Sketch users will be able to open Figma files very soon
Cool, I'll have to check it out soon!
I might very well be missing something but could a solution be to just upon creation store the random reference/doc id somewhere? 
Correct but what if the user does the action again and a new document with different data is created? Then that ID from the last document to reference is overridden with the new ID.
As I understand it you are able to fetch the documents, if so, can you not store the reference in the actual document? 
thanks!
thanks!
is ANYTHING on medium not an ad for some other thing? really considering blacklisting the domain as spam on my pi-hole so i don't accidentally click it
As I recall you are able to first create the ID, then set the document data using that ID. Firestore generates your ID for you but the document is not yet created. let randomlyCreatedID = yourDataBase.collection("userID").Document() //create the ID randomlyCreatedID.setData(yourDictionary) { //Create the actual document,include the randomlyCreatedID in the data.. error handling } &amp;#x200B;
That is correct but now how am I able to reference that specific ID in each document. So what you explained was the storage of it now how can I retrieve it. So basically once it‚Äôs stored ALL the documents from that collection are retrieved and displayed in cells in a table view but if I want to delete one cell that means I need to delete that specific document in firestore. Which means I need that specific ID that‚Äôs tired to that cell. How can I get that?
Every single one of your examples has 3 columns. He‚Äôs pointing to all of them. 
What happens when you set the `schemaVersion to 1` and change the `if oldSchema &lt; 1` to `if oldSchema &lt; 2` ?
I edit the original post to include it.
What does the init look like for AudioReader? Also what happens when you change AudioReader to a struct?
So what your saying is that if I store the documentID with the document itself then when I call that index row in the table view it should automatically call that reference ID tied to that cell as well?
Yes, but just the stuff that's merely inane babbling.
Hi there, You are putting your params as a httpBody, instead of in the header of the request :) So basically if you remove your line : // to remove request.httpBody = try? JSONSerialization.data(withJSONObject: params, options: \[\]) &amp;#x200B; And add in the request header : request.addValue("application/json", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type") request.addValue("8a7dd147", forHTTPHeaderField: "app\_id") request.addValue("7e7d022fbce6d8d4523eac3baa5bd04c", forHTTPHeaderField: "app\_key") I added application/json as content-type, some server would complain.
Yes, if you store the content and the documentID in the document, and you build your tableview from an array of structs with a similar structure, you should be able to reference the documentID/documentreference like that. A bit hard to explain but I think there are great examples in the Firestore documentation as well &amp;#x200B;
I cannot change AudioReader to a struct. I'm using some @objc, which can't be used in structs.
They literally have an example in Swift on their documentation page: https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/documentation#!/Dictionary32entries/get_entries_source_lang_word_id
Glad I could help!
Apart from that, the method doesn‚Äôt throw. It handles the exception itself. 
You title this like it's difficult. Xcode and Swift is a combination ripe for breaking Xcode. I no longer do iOS work, but when I did for 2 years, Xcode was the buggiest piece of garbage I've ever used. 
So, I presented this as kind of a joke, but it's a serious issue. I do not know how this happened or how to fix it. Pretty much everything has gone sideways since I included the Objective-C-Swift header in order to call swift from obj-c. It shortcut my imports, which meant they needed importing again - then it somehow did double-imports and marked certain classes as redefined. Now it seems to have allowed these double-defines in this case and now thinks AKNodes are not AKNodes. Has anyone seen this before or know what to do about it?
Yeah, i've had nothing but problems with it. I spend at least 75% of my time wrestling with xcode and the other 25% actually writing code.
Sounds like my experience!
Yep, it works in my IDE. I don't know if `URLSession` has been ported to Linux, so that could definitely be the issue.
I miss Project Builder. Granted the build process is lightyears beyond where it was in those days, but .. PB + IB seemed a lot more stable than Xcode in general. I don't have many issues with Xcode, but when I do they tend to ruin my day.
It's annoying how this is the standard xcode 1st step, but yes I have. It does nothing but require me to wait forever during the next build as 914 files need to compile.
Programming in general is like 10% code writing and 90% troubleshooting with something
I couldn't even get past the basic Swift/iOS tutorial without chasing down the solutions to several bugs. I eventually had a functional app, but major features didn't work properly and I was never able to figure out why.
It could just be a bad error message. The problem might actually be that it's not a throwing message.
I've heard good things about AppCode FWIW. 
You can create your own project template: https://useyourloaf.com/blog/creating-custom-xcode-project-templates/
Right. The API call is asynchronous and if you're running it in the shell, you need to wait for the call to return before ending your script.
We had some trouble with AudioKit moving from XCode 9 to 10 as well. I ended up having to completely remove it from pods, re-add it, pod install, clean, then rebuild.
When you retrieve the data to populate your cell, you can also grab the document's randomID inside its collection. I think the randomID could be found under ```singleDocumentFromSnapShot.documentID```. So just store that value in your app and when you delete, use that documentID value to reference the correct database value and call reloadData() on your collectionView/tableView
File an issue on GitHub if you‚Äôre stuck. The AudioKit community is super helpful!
I definitely don't disagree.

Does it do playgrounds?
Eh, don‚Äôt think so
I am new to Swift and thought that kind of error just happened to me, once I had a similar error: cannot convert value String to string O\_o ...
It often breaks itself.
Is the type aliased locally? Try using the full package name + type in the function signature.
There is no best practice, but if your end value is less than your start value, don't use Range. What's the API response look like? You could always match that to keep some consistency between your back end and front end. Otherwise, keeping two values in separate variables is fine. Especially if those are inside a struct. If you're dealing with just that subset of the struct (min:Int, max:Int) often, passing it to functions and having it returned, then it might be worthwhile to wrap them in a named Tuple and assign it to a typeAlias: typeAlias Foo = (start: Int, end: Int) And you can use it like this: let foo = Foo(start: 10, end: 1) print(foo.start) Foo is a placeholder name. You should replace it with a term that describes the business/user need of those values. I can't think of a good generic name.
I‚Äôm guessing you have another class with the same name. Xcode should probably include the package for framework name if they‚Äôre the same name. Or you have a typealias set.
You must not of been developing very long. Xcode is quite good compared to other IDE. Ever worked on Android back in the Eclipse ADT days? Obviously not.
"Quite good" in terms of features? Sure. It's great in that regard minus the fact that it couldn't handle refactoring Swift. Whether or not that is still true, I'm not sure. I hear all the time that Xcode is good. But relative to other professional IDEs like Goland or PyCharm it is still subpar. They are both wildly more stable, support plugins across all Jetbrains IDEs, and generally have a larger feature set. They may not be as smooth on the eyes as Xcode in the UI department, but I really don't give a damn if I have to fight the IDE using an officially supported language. When I'm work 8-10+ hours a day trying to launch a product I could care less about the UI. I just want the tool to function as it is supposed to. I can't tell you how many times my old team got bit by the massive build times due to Xcode and compiler bugs in Swift. 400k+ line project and we'd just go for a walk whenever we started a build. Unacceptable. 
Also, no, I did not work on Android during the Eclipse ADT days. I actually put off learning it because it was that bad from what I read. 
Type aliasing is the sort of feature that seems useless until it seems amazing. In my case, until I realized that you could alias any collection, no matter how nested and complex. I previously had most functions returning special structs, and a few that returned one fairly complex value like `[String: (customStructIAmReplacingForClarity: CustomStruct, forSale: Bool)]`. I didn‚Äôt want to make a struct with one property and nothing else, and with type aliasing I don‚Äôt have to. &amp;#x200B; I‚Äôve ended up going with the following to store things: `let tupleName: (first: Int, second: Int)` I even wrote a function that can take two `Int?` values and spit out an `(Int, Int)?` value. These values should always be in pairs, so that‚Äôs a good way of representing that in code. Better than having a non-optional tuple that can contain two `nil` values, anyway. By the way, I know there is no such thing as ‚Äúbest practice‚Äù, just as there is no such thing as perfection. I‚Äôm not looking for The Correct Answer, I‚Äôm looking for advice like what you gave.
So like this? &amp;#x200B; `func deleteItemAction(at indexPath: IndexPath) -&gt; UIContextualAction? {` `let deleteAction = UIContextualAction(style: .destructive, title: "Delete") { (action, view, completion) in` `let documentID = self.userInfo[indexPath.row].documentID` `let userID = Auth.auth().currentUser` `print("Document ID is: \(documentID)")` `self.db.collection("Users").document("User: \(userID!)").collection("Information").document(documentID).delete()` `self.userInfo.remove(at: indexPath.row)` `self.tableView.deleteRows(at: [indexPath], with: .automatic)` `completion(true)` `}` `deleteAction.image = imageLiteral(resourceName: "DeleteListItemIcon")` `deleteAction.backgroundColor = .red` `return deleteAction` `}`

There is no rule you have to use Swift. You could of stayed in ObjC. Long build times when mixing the two were common in the early days. I didn‚Äôt start adding in Swift till v3. In Swift 4+ it‚Äôs much improved especially with the build system in Xcode 10
You do when your massive company sets an iOS development standard that all new code is in Swift. 
Sounds like you made a good choice by leaving. Development standards are usually created by folks without the experience to know better. Early versions of Swift were an absolute dumpster.
It‚Äôs just a standard UINavigationBar. It‚Äôs a very straightforward screen in general being presented modally by the settings screen.

In my experience when not using CocoaPods, Xcode is way more stable. Using Carthage for iOS &amp; macOS development and Package Manager for Server-Side swift.
Interesting. I‚Äôve never used Carthage. 
It's even worse now, as they didn't update the tutorials and books yet. 
Using Carthage, does not ‚Äúextend‚Äù your project file into a workspace that is glued together with an x amount config files. It keeps your project clean and separate from the dependency management system. You just build the frameworks you want added and link the compiled frameworks to your project. I had to maintain an in-house solution that consisted of 5 custom build pods, that depended on each other. It was a constant struggle with Cocoa Pods, always doing the delete everything and do another pod install. Very time consuming and frustrating. 
I don't think it's an issue with AudioKit. It's an issue with the way xcode handles frameworks when trying to import the swift header. AudioKit was working fine before importing the swift header.
I don't have the code in front of me (at home), but I do not think there is an alias for this, but it's worth checking. Thanks for the suggestion.
The default components always come in the left column :) Actually, it's quite recognizable visually, IMHO, because we're always interacting with default native iOS controls and we saved it in our memory :))
You must me new here, this happens way to often. Not to talk about 1k other issues xcode has.
I think I understand but I‚Äôm not sure how Xcode would know how to apply new standards to an arbitrary year old project? There is usually a prompt to update project settings at each new Xcode version 
I probably disagree with the last point for production apps. I don‚Äôt want a git commit with a fresh start, I want one with a few discrete changes 
Have you tried cleaning your Xcode project? Usually that works. Sometimes it doesn't...
I have same issues. Nvram reset seemed to help. 
Playgrounds had huge potential but the way Apple screws things lately is just astonishing.
Try to **Switch to macOS platform** In the upper right corner of your Xcode Playground, click on show/hide Utilities--&gt; file inspector --&gt; Playground Setting--&gt; Platform--&gt; macOS
Hey, noevchon, just a quick heads-up: **beleive** is actually spelled **believe**. You can remember it by **i before e**. Have a nice day! ^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
You are not something wrong, this is a common problem with playgrounds. You can to switch to MacOS platform like mentioned before, but it didn't really help in my case.
i'm already MacOS platform :'(
Don‚Äôt waste your time with Playgrounds. They‚Äôve always been terrible.
Is there a best practice way of how to do this? Is there an automatic mechanism (i.e. not waiting on a dispatch group that requires manual enters/exits) to do this? Perhaps using dispatch queues, or run loops? IIRC regular mac/iOS apps use a run loop to keep the main thread busy instead of terminating early.
Ah, I see. That `compactMap({ $`[`0.name`](https://0.name) `})` portion was vital as well. Great, thank you so much!
Fuck Frank, it's a piece of shit.
Playgrounds do not work well. You could check out using something like [CodeRunner](https://coderunnerapp.com/) but it does cost money after the trial. I have yet to have anything crash while using it.
The issue is the form is located within a iframe which wkwebview.evaluatejavascript does not support. [This](https://medium.com/@DrawandCode/how-to-communicate-with-iframes-inside-webview-2c9c86436edb) medium article may be helpful.
Pretty much this. I can‚Äôt stand it trying to always compile and run half written code when I pause to think while typing.
Good advice - thank you. I added the code per that article to allow JS within the iframe but still no luck. I edited my main post to update my code if you have any other thoughts. Thanks!
I also just ran document.getElementById("pat_lastname").value = "test" in the javascript console in safari and see it DOES work there, so I must need to tune up the iFrame code a little more? 
The problem with the WKUserScript is it executes the js when the page finishes loading from a network perspective but it appears that the form is not fully rendered until a little bit after the page finishes "loading" causing you trying to fill in a form that does not exist yet. I am not sure if there is a more elegant solution to this but one way you can do this is by adding a interval in your js that will keep running until complete. `let js = """` `var i = setInterval(function(){` `document.getElementById('pat_lastname').value = 'Test Last';` `if (document.getElementById('pat_lastname').value == 'Test Last') {` `clearInterval(i);` `}` `}, 200);` `"""` &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Welcome to Apple development!
Another great programming language to learn is [Rholang](https://github.com/JoshOrndorff/LearnRholangByExample?utm_source=www.rchain.coop/blog&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=learn_rholang_byexample).

Reference work. Plain app purchases. I can‚Äôt live off it, but it‚Äôs a nice bonus to have. 
awesome car
Make a todo list before the interview(use coredata or firebase depending on the requirements). It will probably cover everything you will need in the interview. Practice auto-layout very well and you will be fine.
Thanks! 
As a side project while I was learning Swift, I made a utility app for a popular card game that has banner and interstitial ads, with an IAP to remove them. In about 10-11 months I‚Äôve made ~US$1000 from the ads alone, and probably about US$500 from the in-app purchase. Keep in mind, I also have an Android version of my app which does pretty well too. It‚Äôs important to cover as many bases as possible when monetisation is your goal!
Stick with what you know, be very, very careful getting into something you can't explain. Pretend like you're going to teach someone else. Pretend like you have to explain it to someone that has never programmed in Swift. Make a step by step for things so you remember each step to take. Do the projects from ground zero several times so you remember all the details. Be careful of being dependent on 3rd party stuff, things like parsers and other tools because they might not use them or have them for the test, so you'd be stuck. I'd probably have connecting to a web service down pact. Plenty of examples of weather apps or stock price quote apps. Write out a step by step and do it several times from scratch.
‚ÄúPretend like you're going to teach someone else. Pretend like you have to explain it to someone that has never programmed in Swift.‚Äù Really like this approach! Thank you for your advices. 
Finance app. I make about $1000 a month, mostly from ads, but also in app purchases. 
Facebook ads and tried a little bit of Apple Search ads too

[Cucumberish](https://github.com/Ahmed-Ali/Cucumberish) is written in Swift.
Wasn't sure about that one, now I know.
Be able to make a request to an API and parse the Json
I would recommend Codable for the parsing.
Look for a file named {AppName}.entitlements in your project. If you find it, remove the aps-enviroment key and try to deploy again. That should clear the configuration for push notifications. Another way to check if they are enabled is unchecking the ‚ÄúAutomatically manage signing‚Äù and switching your Provisioning Profile to ‚ÄúNone‚Äù. The Capabilities tab should show the push notifications toggle now.
Hey, Kotzzi, just a quick heads-up: **enviroment** is actually spelled **environment**. You can remember it by **n before the m**. Have a nice day! ^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
Try to make master / detail apps where the first screen is a list of cells fetched from an API and the second screen is some details about it, perhaps a form to change it and save it. But that's a lot for 90 minutes! Make sure you can more or less automatically whip up an application that does the following: * Connect to an API using URLSession * Parse the results using Codable * Refresh a UITableView with the data * Implement Delegate and DataSource in an extension * Use auto layouts to have automatically sizing cells * Segue to the detail or edit screen by tapping the row * Layout and set the detail / edit screen with the selected row * Make sure you show spinners when it's busy * Make sure all long running processes don't happen on the main thread * Make sure heavy stuff like date parsing doesn't happen on the main thread * Make sure you are reusing cells in the right way * Don't use forced casts A good example of an API is the Etsy API: [https://www.etsy.com/developers/documentation/getting\_started/api\_basics](https://www.etsy.com/developers/documentation/getting_started/api_basics) It also has images which are another interesting challenge on UITableViewCells (the download might finish after the cells has been reused already!). If you get it all right you would go straight to medior instead of junior.

That's right. Because building for the simulator doesn't require code signing. 
This is an hour coding exam. He'll be asked to either write a single algorithmic function inside a playground, or implement a single UITableviewController in a project. There won't be time for writing tests or splitting up viewcontrollers beyond spinning off a basic model or util class. I'm not sure what you mean by dependency injection in the context of an iOS app, but that doesn't make any sense at all to me.
Don‚Äôt set the popoverPresentationController. It‚Äôs unrelated to what you‚Äôre trying to do. Follow this example to get a better understanding of activity view controllers: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/118/uiactivityviewcontroller-by-example
Here‚Äôs a link for those on Apollo: [The Tale of the Missing Clear Button](https://youtu.be/SvulZOnI0hc)
Utility app that uses compass and location to work out points of interest. No ads, pay upfront, has been on the App Store for 5+ years. Makes about USD$1000 a month. Honestly, I think it‚Äôs a great app, but it‚Äôs mostly luck because everything I‚Äôve done feels like it defies logic. I‚Äôve tried to create other apps on the side and nothing has done as well as this. Few things I did to get it to market. First, talked about it in a forum when I was looking for beta testers. Second, setup a website and took email addresses. Got about 70 emails. Third, posted on a couple of forums dedicated to the demographic of the app. Lucky that this demographic uses forums. Forth, I initially sold the app in T2 pricing. After 12 months I bumped not to T5 and the sales just went up. I have maintained it ever since, including built in help and answering support emails. Started off on Obj-C when I was at college, then Swift 1, and now 99% Swift 4.2. 
In-app purchases, its Travel category (app containing public transport info for the city I live in). I've made two apps in this category and combined they make me around ~$100 per month. Not really impressive but at least I won't need to worry about Apple developer fees and be able to buy few ramens a month üòÇ I posted those apps in my city subreddit during first launch, and thats it. Kinda grateful that they ranked pretty high in App Store for certain keywords after few years.
[`Date.distantFuture`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/date/1779684-distantfuture)
Another great idea is to avoid the issue by making a type that can represent a bad encoding, like found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46344963/swift-jsondecode-decoding-arrays-fails-if-single-element-decoding-fails): struct FailableDecodable&lt;Base : Decodable&gt; : Decodable { let base: Base? init(from decoder: Decoder) throws { let container = try decoder.singleValueContainer() self.base = try? container.decode(Base.self) } } struct Foo: Decodable { let endDate: FailableDecodable&lt;Date&gt; } 
Thanks a lot! I finally got it working after struggling a bit to find out how to use the Timer. Didn't end up using the dateformatter because I am using a slider right now to set the countdown time and I just counted the labels down. Another question I have though is if I want this to be like the MVC 'method', should I seperate the code that tracks the time and the code that visualizes it on the app in like different classes/files?

I did it that way when storyboards first came out, but they weren't nearly as capable back then. Now that there is a system to easily segue from one storyboard to another, you could always setup your storyboards to hold only one view controller. In effect treating it like an XIB file. I do this quite a bit now.
One technique for executing code every {short time interval}: CADisplayLink
Ah interesting, I didn't think about that route - that sounds like a mix of both/best of both worlds haha. I'll check it out, thanks!
There's nothing wrong with the way you're doing it. Essentially you have three main choices: 1. Storyboards/xibs 2. Programmatic 3. Hybrid of #1 and #2 Personally I like #2 because it's the most flexible, but it's less visual, requires more code, and often takes a little longer initially. Your hybrid approach is absolutely fine. 
I use no storyboards, a couple xib files for start up and stuff like that. Things to do: have specific functions to build ui and manipulate ui, verses getting data, and another set of methods to bind the two together. Also, identify blocks of complex ui and make controls. Even if they are only used once. The same thing applies for breaking the functionality apart. If you find you have common layout patterns, create helper methods for them. A lot of this comes from years of building web content displays in JavaScript using JQuery. People started to hate JQuery because you could easily create master methods that did everything in a single function (hundreds of lines long), which were impossible to maintain without heavy refactoring. We still need master/controller methods, but they should be very short and easy to read, with other functions doing the messy heavy lifting. Also, I like the MVVM patterns.
dictionary[‚Äûname‚Äú] = ‚Äûxyz‚Äú
Yes but it says that... dictionary is a get only property
My personal preference is to do all UI in code now - but I used to do it this way with storyboards as well. To do it easily you can use the "Editor"-&gt;"Embed In"-&gt;"Storyboard" menu item. I've had it crash etc in older Xcode versions, so I always make sure I've committed my code/storyboards before trying it. Having a single VC per storyboard makes it a lot easier to avoid merge conflicts when working with other people.
Why don‚Äòt you want to make it public? Like public var
You just need to do: myDictionary["name"] = "Some Name Value" This code looks pretty rough: convenience init(dictionary: [String: Any]) { let name = dictionary["name"] as! String? ?? "" let city = dictionary["city"] as! String? ?? "" let state = dictionary["state"] as! String? ?? "" let address = dictionary["address"] as! String? ?? "" let timeStamp = dictionary["timeStamp"] as! Timestamp self.init(name: name, city: city, address: address, state: state, timeStamp: timeStamp, documentID: "") } You could do: let name = dictionary["name"] ?? ""
Thank you for the link, it will definitely come in handy in future. Unfortunately, having removed the popoverPresentationController and using the guide in the link, I'm still getting the same issue regarding the view controller not being in the window hierarchy. &amp;#x200B; I'll continue googling but if you / anyone else has any other suggestions I'd love to hear them.
There‚Äôs a few things I have questions about from reading the code. 1. Is a Dictionary the right structure here? Could you use a struct? 2. The 1st convenience init is just adding default values which you could add in the init declaration. But you never want an ‚Äúempty‚Äù dictionary so why not use an optional? 3. You never mutate the values of dictionary in buttonHasBeenPressed() so it will always contain the initial values.
It‚Äôs all tools in the toolbox, most projects are a mix of all three. I use storyboards for a lot of layout, page navigation, etc. Xibs and/or programmatic for reusable components. There‚Äôs no best way, only the way that‚Äôs best right now.
Your dictionary is read only. It just returns your current values of name, city, address, etc. But you don't update those values. Where you put the line "// This is where the ISSU...", put this: self.name = name self.city = city self.address = address self.state = state Now self.dictionary will have the correct values.
I was wondering, too.
I've made enough in \~3 years to buy a new car. It's coming mostly from my travel app.
Just go full programmatic, then, since you're not using the retarded fucking storyboards, you get to do dependency injection of ViewControllers through their initializers which can now be custom. For the programmatic layout, stay away from fucking AutoLayout, that shit is fucking done, use this shit instead https://github.com/layoutBox/FlexLayout You can thank me later. 
You won't find a single major company out there that uses storyboards, interface builder, or even autolayout. Everything is done programatically. You have significantly more control and flexibility and will scale dramatically better towards a large codebase. Even Apple is 100% programmatic on their apps outside of demo shit.
Actually change colours throughout an app using storyboards is very easy if you use named colours.
Well, you kept it DRY all right! :D
Daemons have no user interface. Agents do. Daemons can run as a not-real user. Agents need to be a user logged into the GUI.
Yes, my program is daemon, ornI intend it to be, as there's no GUI. Now I have to learn how to setup it to start with the OS and other details. 
You can use [SMJobBless](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/1431078-smjobbless) to install a privileged helper, though that has quite specific requirements. Your helper and your app need to be signed, your helper is in the app bundle in a particular location, and the helper contains an `Info.plist` and `launchd.plist` embedded using the linker. Look at the documentation linked there for more details on how it needs to be done. I wrote [a sample project](https://github.com/iamleeg/LogViewer) showing how to do it years ago, it uses API that's now deprecated (`SMJobCopyDictionary`) so ignore that bit, and look at how the `logcat` tool is built and packaged into the app.

Either one is correct- I think under the hood (at least in Objective-C, that was true) ```init()``` just calls ```init(frame: CGRect.zero)```, which is the designated initializer for ```UIView```. I like to use the parameter-less version when I can, because it is more terse.

You're just reposting this every few weeks? https://reddit.com/r/swift/comments/9ih0ur/module_oriented_architecture_part_1_coupling_and/
Give/When/Then is a good test separation methodology. If you are focussing on using natural language, there are projects like cucumber / calabash / quick / nimble. which are all libraries in support of 'Behavior driven development'. 
Can you open other sites in a webview in your app? Can you write a simple routine to allow you to type in any site inside of your webview inside of your app? That would tell you if you can access other sites or not. Can you access the site from a desktop browser, can get get the data from that desktop browser and send that to your app and see what happens? Kind of a custom "off line loader" thing.
A much better solution is this: https://github.com/theappbusiness/TABTestKit It‚Äôs a library developed by the smart guys in the company I work for. It makes your tests strongly typed (rather than stringly typed, in your case) and easier to read.
You need to setup an outlet for the textfield, in your controller‚Äôs class. Then you access the content with the attribute ‚Äòtext‚Äô, which is of type String. Finally you can instantiate a new Integer doing Int(theString), though you have to be careful as it will only optionally work, it will return Int? Hope this helps!
By text box I‚Äôm assuming you mean UITextField. That element has a property called text that‚Äôs an optional string. I‚Äôm on mobile so forgive the formatting but basically you would do this. guard let text = textField.text else { return } let int = Int(text) Int would now be the integer representation of the String. There are a few ways to do this but that‚Äôs one of them. 
So, for example: &amp;#x200B; &gt;`@IBOutlet weak var firstNumber: UITextField!` &gt; &gt;`@IBOutlet weak var secondNumber: UITextField!` &gt; &gt;`let product = Int(firstNumber.text) * Int(secondNumber.text)` &amp;#x200B; How close is this? &amp;#x200B;
Close. Very close. Are you familiar with working with optionals? The thing there is that you can‚Äôt use an optional as parameter for the Int initializer. And also since this is an optional initializer, you are trying to multiply two Int? values. If you are 100% sure the user inputs numbers and the conversions will work you should do something like: @IBOutlet weak var firstNumber: UITextField! @IBOutlet weak var secondNumber: UITextField! let product = Int(firstNumber.text!)! * Int(secondNumber.text!)! Notice the ‚Äò!‚Äô to unwrap the optional values. Good luck! // sorry for format, I‚Äôm in mobile 
You're going to need to unwrap those ints, because `Int(string)` returns an optional.
Use a number formatted instead of casting the string to int. Numbers are different in different languages. 
Okay, if anyone requires the answer, I used CocoaAsyncSocket Library which is written in objective-C actually but you can use it in Swift projects too. I used the CocoaAsyncUDPSocket delegate methods and protocols, for achieving the same. Though I could not live stream the data, don't know what was the issue with that, what I could achieve is recording an audio and saving and then send it on a button tap. 
The last line needs to be within the last curly brace of the function. The variable compositeScore only has a scope within the function itself. If you want to use the same variable outside the function, it will need to be declared outside the function instead. 
So did I. My point was, if you‚Äôre starting a new app the issue with changing colours throughout the app has been made much simpler with named colours.
It looks like your structure is wrong. I think your message should be in commit struct.
If you can read C++, then you can check out the Swift source code. My understanding is that the compiler writes the codable conformance (at compile time), so the code is static (not dynamic). Either the CodingKeys are explicit, or it implicitly infers them, and the properties with their types are right there in the source code.
Wow, that's pretty cool. I guess that means I won't be able to write my own without building the Swift compiler from source, correct?
Like /u/-spookyaction- said, `compositeScore` only exists inside of your function. You need to declare a variable outside of the function and then *alter* that variable inside your function. Here's a partial example: final class MyViewController: UIViewController { private var compositeScore = 0 // Other stuff @IBAction func scoreEntered(_ sender: UIButton) { let scoreString = sender.title(for: .normal)! let scoreDouble = Double(scoreString) compositeScore = scoreDouble * 3 print(compositeScore) } func someOtherFunc() { let currentScore = compositeScore + 9 // use currenScore } } Notice how `compositeScore` is a private variable of the *class*, not of the function. The functions have access to it, since they're also part of the class.
For new apps for sure, even designer tools can now export as named colors AFAIR
I know it's been a while but I've not been working on this for various reasons until today. Can you help me with setting the size and opacity of the webview? I can't seem to get it to change
/u/fort_and_langley is correct: `Codable` works primarily using compiler synthesis of methods and implementations, without dynamic help or metaprogramming. There are 3 main components to the feature: 1. The standard library [protocols and types](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/stdlib/public/core/Codable.swift.gyb), 2. The Swift compiler portions which synthesize implementations for [`Codable`](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/lib/Sema/DerivedConformanceCodable.cpp) and [`CodingKey`](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/lib/Sema/DerivedConformanceCodingKey.cpp) 3. Implementations in Foundation for [`JSONEncoder`](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/stdlib/public/SDK/Foundation/JSONEncoder.swift) and [`PropertyListEncoder`](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/stdlib/public/SDK/Foundation/PlistEncoder.swift) The part you‚Äôre likely interested in is the compiler portion, which happens as follows: 1. When a type conforms to `Encodable`/`Decodable`/both, it has to provide implementations of `encode(to:)`/`init(from:)`. If a type has protocol requirements but does not provide method implementations which fulfill the requirements, the compiler will generally give an error; however, there are a few special types for which the compiler is allowed to synthesize the method implementations necessary to *make* the types conform (e.g. `RawRepresentable` methods on enums with a raw type, and more recently `Hashable` and `Equatable` implementations for most trivial types). `Encodable` and `Decodable` are some of these types, and by ‚Äúsynthesize‚Äù I mean that the compiler effectively ‚Äúwrites‚Äù the code for you, as if you had typed it out yourself (this is done by modifying the AST‚Äîabstract syntax tree‚Äîthe representation the compiler has of the code you‚Äôve written) 2. When the compiler looks to synthesize `Encodable`/`Decodable` conformance, it looks to see if the type has a nested enum type called `CodingKeys` which conforms to `CodingKey`. (This type can be provided via a `typealias` as well). If the type isn‚Äôt an enum, or doesn‚Äôt conform to `CodingKeys`, synthesis isn‚Äôt possible and the compiler will give an error; if the type doesn‚Äôt exist, the compiler will then try to synthesize the `CodingKeys` enum as well 3. To do this, the compiler looks at all of the properties on the conforming type (skipping computed, static, and lazy vars) ‚Äî if all are `Encodable`/`Decodable`, then synthesis is possible. It modifies the AST to insert a new type typed `private enum CodingKeys : String, CodingKey` with a case for every `Codable` property. (If a `CodingKeys` type already existed, the compiler just verifies that the case names line up with the property names, and that the referenced properties are `Codable`) 4. If we‚Äôve made it this far, the compiler is then able to insert an implementation for `init(from:)` or `encode(to:)` based on the properties listed in the `CodingKeys` enum: it iterates over the `CodingKeys` enum, finds the matching property with that name, and inserts an `encode(..., forKey: ...)` or `decode(..., forKey: ...)` call based on the type and name of the property There is some amount of detail left out of this description, but that‚Äôs the gist. Because this is done in the compiler itself, there‚Äôs easy access to all types, names, and info the compiler already has about the code ‚Äî the process is relatively straight-forward. Happy to answer any questions you might have about the process/any other details that might be interesting. tl;dr, though: yes, without extending the Swift compiler itself, it‚Äôs currently not possible to add support for another protocol like this. With better metaprogramming features in the future (hygienic macros, or however you might want to call it), we might be able to move the feature out of the compiler and into ‚Äúregular‚Äù Swift code in the standard library, or similar.

Have you tried to set the Playground to manually run? (by default Playground will run your code after each keystrokes, taking lots of CPU and more prone to crash). You can set it to manually run by long pressing the 'Play' button : ![manual run](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/16-playground-tips/manually_run.png) Then you click the play button to run code next time, I did this and my crash frequency has reduced.
Whoops, you‚Äôre right. I guess I couldn‚Äôt see it thought the brackets ended after the authors last bracket. Welp, sorry for the dumb question, but at least I learned something.
Turned out it had to do something with the headerField in request.addValue
What‚Äôs the reason for wanting to automatically send an email? Could this be done using an email service instead? 
I recently did a coding test for a job I was applying for that requested I use their "search" and "product details" API along with one native platform API. I made a teeny app that can search their products, see a product detail, then use ARKit to put a card with the product image on your desk or carpet or whatever. I got the job.
Make a sample Email app, just the inbox.
Easiest way to do this is to save a date using user defaults when the correct code is used. The code authentication should be done through one of your apps. You then look for the key where that date is saved if it exists you do a check for valid time. If the date is past the valid date then you disable the features and request for a new code. 
Seems straightforward, all you need is a struct defining: 1. **featureId**: a string or other type that will hold a unique value for the feature you want enabled/disabled 2. **isEnabled**: a boolean to determine wether or not the feature is currently enabled 3. **expiryDate**: a Date/time value to determine when exactly will this feature switch to a disabled value if it is currently enabled Each time your user types in a "code" for renewing the feature you alter the expiry date to some future value. The "code" for renewing the feature should never be stored in you app or amongst it's internal files or databases. You should only have algorithms that verifies the "code" entered in by the user and then updates the expiry date appropriately. An array of instances of this structure can be saved locally as a .json or .plist file or they can be stored in the **UserDefaults** object (recommended). At which point your app can just reference the array to see if a feature is enabled (and if it has then passed the expiry date) or disabled.
Hey, thank you SO MUCH for the reply! This has cleared up things for me considerably. We‚Äôve been using Mock classes for Unit tests but think this is the best way forward with UI tests as well. Thanks again!
I'm not sure this would be permitted under the App Store guidelines, though it might be depending. &gt; Apps that collect user or usage data must secure user consent for the collection. Paid functionality must not be dependent on or require a user to grant access to this data. and &gt; Apps should only request access to data relevant to the core functionality of the app and should only collect and use data that is required to accomplish the relevant task. [From here.](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#privacy) Yes, technically it's quite simple, but 8% of apps get rejected for just this sort of thing.
Assuming this is iOS app, it might be tricky to get this by apples approval process. Is the feature free or cost money? Is just to get their email? If it cost money, you won‚Äôt be able to redirect users to your website or email. You can‚Äôt even tell user go to your website to buy code. They would just have to somehow magically know. If you want to bypass Apple payment (subscription in app purchase), the best bet is to use a login/password. Ask users to login to your service, better chance they will guess they need to go to your website. You still can‚Äôt link to your site to ‚ÄúRegister/buy‚Äù. As a user I would prefer to buy through Apple, more secure and I won‚Äôt have to hand over email adresss and CRedit card info to 3rd party. Why not just use apples subscription methodology, you can set the length of subscription. Apple will handle the $$. You don‚Äôt have to set up codes. Users will be less confused. No email codes, etc. 
I‚Äôm not sure how this relates? I wasn‚Äôt planning on collecting any user data.
You're requiring personal information (their email address, even if you don't get it through the app) to enable app features. It's directly relevant.
That‚Äôs interesting. I hadn‚Äôt thought about that. I was picturing that we‚Äôd just send the code to people when they renewed their membership. Many, but not all, members have email addresses. Some we just contact by mail. But I wonder if I made an option to purchase a code through the app without sending any information if that would solve things?
It can but for simplicity sake I thought doing in app purchase using the Apple StoreKit would be your go-to. In this case your app would not be the one collecting user info, the app store from Apple would be.
You can‚Äôt sell a ‚Äúcode‚Äù. You sell a feature or subscription. User buys it via App Store. Your app gets a receipt from the App Store saying user purchased feature. Then you unlock feature. The App Store ‚Äúreceipt‚Äù is the proof enough for you to unlock it. No need creating a code and emailing it. 
Ok, thanks. I didn't realize it was against the rules to sell a code to access certain features. I'm new to all of this.
Trying to implement endless scrolling (pagination I think it was called) gave me such a headache when I tried to implement it in an app of mine. I‚Äôll have to revisit it and see if there are some good tutorials for it.
That‚Äôs badass. I really want to learn more about using ARkit. Did that aspect take a while to implement? Just thinking about the time constraints that I might run into in an interview.
I was asked as a junior to build a app that used an open source api to build a weather app. I was also asked to hit a popular image open source api to build a collection view based on search results. 
Using a TestScheduler would be a little simpler and more straightforward.
Honestly, as an interviewer I give candidates unique challenges that they can‚Äôt prepare for other than through programming experience. I‚Äôm not testing for study skills!
Thanks, I‚Äôll check that out! üëç
I was asked a lot of how stuff works underneath like the main run loop, how touches get propagated from the hardware to the relevant view, how using layers instead of views to make images can reduce memory usage, etc. 
Just wondering how much time they gave you to do this app. Sounds too simple for one of those "next day" apps where they give you 24h to turn something in, but maybe too much for 2 hour deal, maybe a 4 hour challenge?
Wow. Thank you. It's going to take me a while to go through and try to wrap my head around this. I'm sure i'll have questions and i'll write back to you. But much appreciated. Exactly what I needed.
Lotta potential here. Anyone get it working yet?
Hello. I need your help in solving this problem. What the final decision looked like?
You can use \`count(where:)\` if you are using Swift 4.2. Here is swift evolution note about it: [https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0220-count-where.md](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0220-count-where.md)

It is not in swift 4.2, check there status **Implemented (Swift 5)**
Oh cr.. sorry, that's my mistake :) well, you still can stick with \`reduce\`
Save the value to User Defaults and load it when launching the app
How large is your array that the speed matters that much? Unless you're working on thousands of elements in a tight loop you shouldn't worry much about the speed. Do it in the most clear way. This smacks of over-optimization.
In this case they gave me a week. I haven't been in a coding role in a few years, so the first day or so was installing tools and getting myself back up to speed, plus laying out the basic navigation and view controller structures. Second day was the bulk of development. API client development, data handling, and implementing the AR stuff. Third day was only a few hours of code cleanup. I've sat on the other side of the desk for the last chunk of my career, so I can tell you, what they're looking for isn't necessarily a ton of polish or complexity. They want to see if you can deliver the requirements of the test. (ALL of them. Leave no box unchecked.) I negotiated with them to include the latest iOS in the requirements--their test document is a little out of date and specifically requested compatibility with iOS 8 or 9, but they had no problem with me instead requiring iOS 11. They want to see if your code is clean and well documented/commented. I always asked for the source to be delivered in a public git repo so I could check their commit habits. They asked for a writeup that comes with it to explain the thinking of the solution, plus some value-add next roadmap items if you were to keep working on it, so I did that in the form of a README in the repo.
Good that they gave you a week. You mentioned AR, Apple's ARKit requires iOS 11, I wonder why they would say iOS 8/9 unless they had some other AR system in mind. Seems like a bit of work TBH, but I guess it depends on how much you already know. That's actually a good thing. One of the biggest flaws in the system is judging someone based on what they already know vs how well they learn and apply knowledge. I get the whole "hit the ground running" thing and not wanting to pay someone for a lot of learning... but you also can't expect a person to know everything for all the different jobs. Overall, seems to be very fair that they gave you a week for that and +1 on the completing every part of it, assumptions aren't a good thing. Sounds like you got a good job out of it.
Always think of a worst case ‚ÄúBigO‚Äù
Sure thing ‚Äî happy to help clarify as needed
It depends, if you‚Äôre doing this to learn yes you‚Äôre correct. If you‚Äôre making an app that will realistically never have more than a 1000 elements, optimizing it to death is useless and you‚Äôre wasting your time that would be better spent on something else.
üëçüèª
If you expand your space complexity, and use get her inside are functions, you could ultimately reduce it to O(1) speed
code: // locale of the on device iTunes Store account currently logged in let locale = product.priceLocale // formatted price tag e.g. $9.99 USD or $7,99 EUR let priceTag = "\(locale.currencySymbol ?? "")\(product.price.description(withLocale: locale)) \(locale.currencyCode ?? "")" print("button text: buy \(product.localizedTitle) for \(priceTag)") outputs in China: button text: buy 100 Coins for ¬•60 CNY button text: buy First Expansion for ¬•328 CNY outputs in Japan: button text: buy 100 Coins for ¬•1080 JPY button text: buy First Expansion for ¬•6000 JPY outputs in Germany: button text: buy 100 Coins for ‚Ç¨9,99 EUR button text: buy First Expansion for ‚Ç¨54,99 EUR 
This is not always true. Remember: Big-O notation says nothing about the total complexity, just how it scales with number of elements. If you're dealing with a small amount of elements then even something with high total complexity might not take an appreciable time. The time spent on the increased code complexity might be detrimental to the overall program. Especially since more complex code tends to have more bugs. Instead, write a simple implementation to start and then optimize it if profiling shows that your program is spending too much time in that function.
He is showing you the correct way to localize the prices. It solves your actual problem instead of your perceived problem (which if you actually solved would likely get you rejected by Apple).
You'd likely be rejected for that - Apple is particular about how IAPs are displayed and displaying them in the user's preferred currency is one of those things.
Are you storing a star rating in an array? Why not just store it in an int?
I chose ARKit. They just wanted me to use one native API. I've wanted the excuse to explore ARKit for months now. This is a management position that codes 25% of the time, and they know I'm not up to speed on what they're using (React Native). In fact, they know that I haven't been in a coding role in several years. They tossed me the test I think mostly to see if I'm really interested.
That's an interesting test. A number of people have come into these forums complaining that they aren't getting job interviews. I asked about 10 if they wanted to do some open source work to enhance their resume. All said yes, only one actually lifted a finger. They want the job but they don't want to do the work. If you go over to some of the other groups, they complain about how hard these code challenges are and how they aren't real world. These are people that want some of the most coveted jobs in the world and they aren't willing to study up on some code challenges.
Thanks for following-up. The background to this question is convoluted so I'll try to keep it concise without leaving anything essential out. &amp;#x200B; **Context:** I have only the most basic software engineering education. Its not what I do. However, I am involved in projects that require that I work with a contract app developer to design software to meet my company's needs. The contractors that my superiors selected were brand new to the business and seriously botched the project. &amp;#x200B; However, we sunk a ton of money into the project before we convinced the higher-ups that the contractor sucked. So our internal IT department tried to duct tape the app into something usable. Exactly why they chose the following solution will probably sound crazy (because it is) but we don't need to address that. At this point, I just want to be able to offer a suggestion on how to make their crazy work-around work better for the end user. &amp;#x200B; Their work-around has the App generate a PDF form and then generate an email that sends said PDF to a folder in Box. However, the user needs to manually send this email because of the limitations MFMailComposeViewController. Needless to say, that isn't going well. The result is that we are not receiving a large portion of these forms because the users simply navigate away from the app rather than taking the extra step. &amp;#x200B; My company does a lot of work in remote areas of the US where cell networks are sometimes unreliable or completely unavailable. That's why we need these e-mails to cache, then automatically send once the device re-established connectivity. I was hoping that some offline persistance solution might exist to handle the caching part then the e-mail could be sent to an SMTP server, bypassing the limitations of MFMailComposeViewController. &amp;#x200B; So, long story short, I need to be able to say to my higher-ups and these contract developers that there is, in fact, a way to send these PDF's to our Box account without requiring the End User to manually submit the e-mail--even when they don't have cell service at the time that the email process is initiated. 
This was a very simple test for someone who's ever written a real world app. But yeah, a code test is a very good disqualifier for casual applicants. 
Do you mean I should display the IAP price in USD for everyone? Seems weird.
No, you should display the price in the user's native currency. I was under the impression that you were trying to display the price in USD for everyone: "Ideally I'd like to display the price in dollars to everyone "
&gt; I won't display in USD for everyone (although I already saw apps doing it). They're probably skating by on the fact that Apple's reviewers essentially never check alternate locales (but then you'll get a reviewer who does and your urgent bug fix release is held up on a translation issue for a language you didn't even realize you were localized for)
Ok so the "product.price.description(withLocale: locale)" is probably better, but the currency symbol is still misplaced (for the euros case). 
Yes that's always the thing with Apple. Sometimes it passes and sometimes it doesn't.

&gt; Software development is not an art. A shocking sentence is a great way to begin! This is a clear pro-Gries, anti-Knuth position. Unfortunately, you don't mention either author -- nor science, theorems, proofs, or any other aspect that Gries ever mentions. There's nothing at all which follows up on this point, and it seems completely unrelated to anything else you've written. &gt; It leaves a very little place for our creativity, imagination and intelligence beyond simple structures and sequences of computational logic. That's a strange claim. Do you have any evidence for it? Almost every program I see is drastically different from others written with similar or even identical specifications. Whenever I've interviewed software developers, for example, and give them an exact specification for a function, even correct responses are often completely different in structure. Databases, compilers, operating systems, and so on are all very different. Even your own article says "There are many ways, how to do it." [sic] &gt; One might argue, that all this change dramatically when observed through the teams and organisations doing it and I would certainly agree with it, but that‚Äôs step into the process I won‚Äôt make in this simple assessment of mine. What?
Have you tried with contentSize?
There are many ways to persist data in Swift, but it is not done automatically. Read up on user defaults as that is the easiest. Keep in mind, it is mostly used to store small amounts of data like the value of a switches .isOn property. For storing larger amounts of data you will need to learn about Core Data or one of the many 3rd party solutions out there. Core Data can be tricky to learn. I‚Äôm still trying to wrap my head around it. 
I dont think table views will auto update size, you have to call begin/end updates to force a resize 
TextView size will not change because it's inside UITableViewCell. I assume your tableView is using autosizing cells. In that case you will need to make a call from your tableView delegate/datasource to force your cell to update itself after you've set up a new constraint for UITextView &amp;#x200B; `tableView.beginUpdates()` `tableView.endUpdates()` &amp;#x200B; Looks pretty useless, but does the trick.
I‚Äôm on my phone, hope I understand the question. The problem here is that non optionals must be assigned a value during initialization. Two solutions would be: - Make all properties variables (var instead of let) and give them default values. - Again make all properties implicitly unwrapped optionals. Meaning they are optional, allowing you to unit without a value, but you are confident they will have a value by the time they are accessed.
Thank you. That makes sense. In my case it was your second suggestion of making them optional. I'm still wrapping my head around those.
where should i add the above methods, I have set the delegate and dataSource for tableview in the storyboard
Firebase/Google is an option .
I started with Structs then had to elevate to a class because of Realm
2MM users and you want free? Google is the only one I know. Of course, there are better options, but they aren‚Äôt free. I‚Äôve been though several and currently prefer AppSee.
I started with Structs then had to elevate to a class because of Realm. I am using the same class for both JSON parsing and realm objects. *try some meta-programming to generate inits for you based in your properties* Do you have any examples?
Without either using mutable properties with defaults or implicitly unwrapped optionals (both of which I agree are bad ideas), there isn't a way to do this. When you declare properties in a class/struct that are not optional (or without default values), your instance needs to be instantiated with them. Think about it like this: Students have name, genders, eyes colors etc. They are not optional in life. So why would it make sense to create a blank `Student` without those values? You are fighting against one of the core values of Swift, **Safety**. These initializers are guaranteeing that all these properties that you have declared are not-optional, will be present after creation. It may be tedious, but having the compiler enforce this safety will save you from an entire class of bugs. 
So, I had a web view used for API requests that I could have exist in a separate UIWindow instance. In your case, since it looks like you'll want the user to interact with it, I'd consider the context of where you're showing it. If it's something that might exist in a separate tab or in place of existing content, you could look into using a container view and, when you initialize the containing view controller, have it initialize your web view and attempt loading content. We did this for one of your detail screens. We fetch location information and show the details in the main screen, but we display location photos in a web view. We try to preload this web view in the background despite it not being visible yet. But as it's a container view, we technically know where the view controller will appear, so we have a frame that we can set the web view to and just change its opacity. Our primary use of resized web views, though, was for API communication. I made a new UIWindow instance of size 1x1, with an alpha of 0.02 (2%). This has a root view controller of a basic view controller with a web view constrained to the view controller's view and added as a subview. So the tree is essentially UIWindow &gt; UIViewController &gt; View &gt; WebView. This UIWindow was then set above the main window by setting its windowLevel to .statusBar, and then making the window visible. At this point, it is considered part of the visible hierarchy and can take API commands.
What are some common issues that you see? 
Architecture is the single biggest issue, but that‚Äôs not purely a Swift issue I suppose. The biggest purely Swift issue I would say is understanding the different between reference types and value types.
What about protocols may I ask? Designing them? Their applications / uses?
The example is in Swift 3.1, is your XCode building with Swift 4?
Oh, I can use them. I'm talking about making my own.
Thank you!
Probably you just turn echo off using tcsetattr(), then turn it back on using tcsetattr() when they hit carriage return. 
How so? Objects are passed by reference and everything else is by value.
The implications are far more complex and far reaching than you‚Äôre making out or understand it to be. For example, the mutation behaviour of let vs var on value types vs reference types.
I feel your pain. There are definite pain points with String vs NSString because String has full Unicode support, where NSString is a fancy wrapper around a byte array (I appreciate it‚Äôs actually a little more complicated than that).
I agree with string ranges. I wouldn't say I "stuggle" with it, rather I ccan't seem to memorize it. Google is consulted every time. In the same boat is stepping through a for loop using increments other than 1. Stride, I just can't memorize your syntax. 
Protocols have become one of my most important and powerful tools when writing code. It changed the way I design applications entirely. I really urge you to at least check this out: [Protocol Oriented Programming](https://www.raywenderlich.com/814-introducing-protocol-oriented-programming-in-swift-3).
Personally I found this easy to grasp, but I was coming from a C/C++ and CS background so the concepts weren‚Äôt new, but the var/let behavior difference like you mentioned would definitely be tricky if Swift was the first language you learned the concepts in.
What the fuck does this function throws.
does this function throw*
Throwing functions must be marked with throws or rethrows.
Didn‚Äôt know enums can have custom inits 
That aside, you should really learn to paste code on reddit. See formatting help. Empty line above and below code blocks, each line indented by four spaces.
Honestly, reading other peoples code. There tends to be this compactness and clever-ness people try to go for that makes sense only to them and in a specific context. I like some of the more verbose Objective-C code because the intention was usually clear in its end approach. An example would be how people are chaining multiple maps / filters / reduce and such to do a task.
The controller that's not in the view hierarchy seems to be your summary view controller. Because we can't see where that code of yours lives, I can't really tell you what's going on. You might create a new controller that's not in the hierarchy, and call the code above in that? &amp;#x200B; Unrelated, but still: \`var postImage = UIImage(named: "\\(croppedImage)")\` makes zero sense. \`croppedImage\` is already an UIImage, so there's no need to create another one. And you probably don't have an image named whatever the description of \`croppedImage\` is. 
Thnx
Yes, I love the labels. But sometimes they are not needed when I make a function call. And sometimes they are. That is my problem. I never understand when they can be skipped. 
The reason tuples behave like this is because they‚Äôre value types. The same happens when using any other value types, such as Ints, in the following snippet: ``` var number = 0 var otherNumber = number otherNumber = 10 // number == 0 // otherNumber == 10 ``` The main reason for naming individual tuple elements is that it gives them more descriptive names than `tuple.0`, `tuple.1`, etc. Furthermore, using name labels allows you to ignore part of the tuple, in cases where you might not need all of it, such as when a function returns a tuple, or you only want certain values from another tuple e.g. ``` let myNumberTuple = (0,1,2,3) let (firstNum, secondNum, _, _) = myNumberTuple print(firstNum) // prints ‚Äú0‚Äù ``` If you want to modify a tuple, you can do so by assigning back to `tuple.0`, `tuple.1`, etc. ``` var myNumberTuple = (0,1,2,3) myNumberTuple.0 = 100 print(myNumberTuple) ```
Generic functions are pretty trivial.
Also: String handling and especially handling Characters. It's correct, I know. But hard.
It's just the assumption that the name would be the element, but it's not the element. Meaning it is a copy of the element, but it's not the element itself. So you could use it in a function that returns a tuple, then you'd have to assign it back to the element at the end.
Why name anything? You could literally have methods that look like this: func a(b: Int, c: Int) -&gt; In0 But this is better: func power(base: Int, exponent: Int) -&gt; Int You name things to self-document them, the same goes for tuples. When you leave them unnamed they are difficult to know which member is which and what they do. Yes, you can memorize the order but by naming them you make it harder to misuse the tuple.
 let x: (String, Int, Double) = ("hello", 5, 0.85) // x is a tuple let (word, number, value) = x // give names to the elements That's not giving name to the elements at all. x is a nameless tuple, and word, number and value are three variables which aren't tuples.
Still, let myNumberTuple = (0,1,2,3) let (firstNum, secondNum, _, _) = myNumberTuple Doesn't involve any named tuples. This is a tuple deconstruction.
The original example, as I mentioned, didn't involve named tuples at all. These ones do.
The naming part is not the problem, it's that the name for the element is NOT the element. If you were a var and I named you thisIsChemistry and changed the value of thisIsChemistry from 5 to 10 it wouldn't change you, it would only change what your name is pointing to. You would still be the same value. In your example of functions, are you able to assign value using those names? If you assign value using those does it actually change the var or does it create a different var and assign there? In your example you have params, but what if they were vars inside of a function. func myNewFunc() var thisIsMyVar = 5 thisIsMyVar = 10 print(thisIsMyVar) // prints 10 not 5 The fact that the name in a tuple doesn't point back to the tuple is not consistent with what you use a var name for. If you use the "." dot notation in my other reply, it works the other way.
For custom objects I don't provide label, only if adds readability like login(with user: User) or login(_ user: User) From that I know what kind of object my function get and also what to expect from that but for primitive types I use them if function name is not self explanatory , specially if you have 2 of same types like login(usernName: String, password: String) 
Interesting point, he (professor from Stanford's 193P) called it naming, but I can see your point. They are a copy of and you can use them as that, but can't assign back which is the odd part.
Yes, like in Java.
How well does that work outside of functions that only throw a single error type?
What‚Äôs odd about it? You have 3 constants there: - x - word - number - value
You specify all the error types a function can throw.
Those are not name labels. What you‚Äôre doing there is assignment to two entirely new variables. Named tuples look like this: let foo = (first: 5, second: 10)
The compiler literally won‚Äôt let you screw up variable assignment (let or var). And if you use var for everything the compiler will throw warnings if it‚Äôs never mutated. There are more advanced features like: let foo = { return ‚Äúfoo‚Äù }() lazy var foo = { return ‚Äúfoo‚Äù}() Those should still be in the first or second chapter of swift. They‚Äôre basic CS principals that Swift has streamlined.
I appreciate that, but that presumably means you must list all the error types that might be thrown by a function call inside of the parent function. It would seem to be a recursive nightmare.
When I saw them as constants, I thought "what if they were vars" and so I did the test and that's when I saw that one way you change the source and the other way you don't. The professor mentioned using tuples as a return value for a function. I guess you can do the same with an array, but he did mention the tuple. So if you write a function that does some work and returns a few values inside of a tuple, you wouldn't use a constant. IDK how much value a tuple constant would have over a struct. The odd part is when he says they are names but they are actually not pointing back to the source, although they do get their initial value from the source. It's kinda hard to to think of a use for that.
Again, you're either ignoring or misunderstanding the complexity of Swift's mutability model, as it goes beyond value assignment. Consider the following, class Person { var name: String init(name: String) { self.name = name } } let person = Person(name: "Oliver") person.name = "Ollie" The value `person` is declared as a constant (`let`), but the object itself can still be mutated. struct Person { var name: String } let person = Person(name: "Oliver") person.name = "Ollie" // ERROR: Cannot assign to property: 'person' is a 'let' constant Here, the value `person` is declared as a variable (`let`) and cannot be mutated, unlike a reference type. This reveals the truth of the difference between a reference type and a value type, where value types are inherently immutable and value types are inherently mutable (though, Swift does afford some niceties to make code cleaner, like marking a value type function as `mutating` which actually reassigns the whole value rather than mutating the actual in-place value).
Okay, that's cool. What's the advantage then? Presumably it enables you to handle all the possible error cases, but how often does that happen? In my experience (which may not be indicative of most people's experience), its rare to enumerate through all error cases, or in other words, to have differing code paths based upon the specific error thrown. Do you have any examples? I'd love to see how this would be useful.
It remembers you of all possible error cases in case you want to relegate the error. For example, you want to relegate different errors at different call levels. If you don't want to write a catch for every possible error, you can catch the class `Exception` which is the parent of all exception classes.
Sorry, just to be clear. In answer to the question, "What aspect of Swift do you struggle with most?", your answer is literally, &gt; other peoples code Well, that's refreshingly honest, I suppose.
You can start reading the first chapter at [https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/application_development/9781788477802](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/application_development/9781788477802)
I think this is just a misunderstanding of what "give names to the elements" is intended to mean. It doesn't mean that it's modifying the original tuple, but instead that it's providing a new way to access the tuple's original values. I think the point of the example is actually less about naming the elements, and more about the syntax that lets you assign multiple variables from a tuple at once. 
So, you're saying that it's like a switch statement which forces you to handle all the error cases, and you can write a default (and possibly re-throw)? If so, that's cool. I could get behind that.
Yes, it does everything that Swift does and doesn't, except you know what will you get thrown by just looking at the function header.
Yes, I think you're right. Just thru me off, didn't expect a copy, I expected a pointer.
Some of that is because Swift's generics are quite lacking. The fact that you can't have a generic protocol as a class field is immensely frustrating, among other things.
For me, it's (recently) the various syntaxes around `case` statements. Things like: if case let Media.movie(_, _, year) = m, year &lt; 1888 { print("Something seems wrong: the movie's year is before the first movie ever made.") } and for case let Media.movie(title, _, year) in mediaList { print(" - \(title) (\(year))") } are basically impossible for me to write without searching for an example. Same with pulling out the value of a nested enum in a switch.
I agree that the `if case ...` syntax is not intuitive. &gt; Same with pulling out the value of a nested enum in a switch. Can you show an example?
Do you mean as an IBOutlet for example? Not sure but I did notice that declaring a protocol as class only seemed to help in some occasions where it didn't before.
what is a class field?
Yeppers
Thanks!
Class member, class field, class property. Whatever Swift calls them. You can't do this: protocol Foo { associatedtype T } protocol Bar: Foo { typealias T = Int } struct S { let bar: Bar } Even though Bar is a fully constrained protocol, it still can't be used as a member field. 
This post of mine is an example of an enum in a struct in an enum: https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/879pg2/advanced_switch_help_avoiding_nested_switches/ Makes my brain melt a bit.
Oh I see. Yeah, that's a little unwieldy. Depending on the situation, I would likely deconstruct that into methods on the struct, if possible.
See my reply to /u/fort_and_langley for what I actually meant. My Swift terminology was a little broken this morning. I meant "protocols with associated types" since Swift doesn't have actual generic protocols.
 You can see the difference between a constant and a variable here: // constant through let: x, xW, xN, xV // variable through var: y, yW, yN, yV let x = ("hello", 5, 0.85) print(x) // ("hello", 5, 0.85) let (xW, xN, xV) = x print(xW, xN, xV, separator: ", ") // hello, 5, 0.85 var y = ("hello", 5, 0.85) print(y) // ("hello", 5, 0.85) var (yW, yN, yV) = y print(yW, yN, yV, separator: ", ") // hello, 5, 0.85 y = ("bye", 10, 1.85) print(y) // ("bye", 10, 1.85) yW = "bird" print(yW, yN, yV) // bird 5 0.85 As you can see, the tuple defined with a `let` is a constant and the one defined with `var` is a variable. The same goes for the other definitions. Using the pattern: let (x, y, z) = (1, 2, 3) is just using a tuple for shorthand to do this: let x = 1 let y = 2 let x = 3 All those names are just separate constants and are not associated with the original tuple at all, other than copying the values at initialization. In addition, **all** tuples have value semantics so they are always copied. If you declare a variable as a tuple and then declare another variable initialized to the first then they will refer to separate instances of that tuple. var foo = (1, 2, 3) let bar = foo foo = (4, 5, 6) print(foo, bar) // (4, 5, 6) (1, 2, 3) The reason for using a tuple over a struct is simplicity. Think of tuples as quick, simple, anonymous structs. If you're using it to return a one-time value and you don't really need to give it a name then it's fine. For example, when you construct a `Dictionary` you can use a sequence of (key, value) tuples: let keyValues = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)] let baz = Dictionary(uniqueKeysWithValues: keyValues) print(baz) Why go through the trouble of making a struct just for that? struct KeyValue { let key: Int let value: Int } let keyValues = [KeyValue(key: 1, value: 2), KeyValue(key: 3, value: 4), KeyValue(key: 5, value: 6)] let baz = Dictionary(uniqueKeysWithValues: keyValues.map { ($0.key, $0.value) }) Even named tuples have their place, although now you're really starting to blur the line between a tuple and a struct. &gt; So if you write a function that does some work and returns a few values inside of a tuple, you wouldn't use a constant. It doesn't matter much either way. Whatever you return from a function is a copy of whatever is initialized inside the function, whether it's a constant or a variable. func countThree(from start: Int) -&gt; (Int, Int, Int) { let counted = (start, start + 1, start + 2) return counted } print(countThree(from: 5)) // (5, 6, 7) That's returning a constant but it would work exactly the same if I used `var`.
Got it, thanks. The function example at the end, I was thinking of a function that would be modifying the var, then return it, not one that would set it at the start, but I see your point. 
More and more the IDE is relying on the compiler (like they do in the Swift ecosystem) and people are realizing how important tooling is to the language. The success of Kotlin is testament to that.
thanks
Could you give an example?
I don't really get what they are useful for or how I would conceive of a situation in which to use the technique productively. What problem am I routinely needing to solve that a closure is going to help me with? How do you go through the process of modeling that in your head and building a closure out of it that fills that need? And the asynchronous aspects throw me for a loop, too. There are a lot of articles out there that cover closures, as does the Swift documentation, so I see the building blocks being used... just not where and why to use them.
Ah, okay. So a very conceptual question, rather than a practical one. Do you use methods like Array‚Äôs filter or map, etc?
The article on AR Kit is really something! Just like Samus Aran's scanner in the Metroid Prime games for his 3rd example of what could be done with it.
Yeah, the map/filter/reduce methods are some of those specific instances where I seem to have got it down. But I don't seem to be mapping that understanding (as it were) onto broader conceptual uses.
Okay, right. So, what about URLSession? Do you use the methods that accept a closure?
What you are doing is tuple deconstruction. ``` let (word, number, value) = x ``` Is functionally the same as ``` let word = x.0 let number x.1 let vale = x.2 ```
wait isn't it struct S { let foo: Foo } which doesn't work? let bar: Bar should work
With some small helper functions this is possible func multiply(_ a: Double, _ b: Double) -&gt; Double { return a * b } func add(_ a: Double, _ b: Double) -&gt; Double { return a + b } func subtract(_ a: Double, _ b: Double) -&gt; Double { return a - b } func divide(_ a: Double, _ b: Double) -&gt; Double { return a / b } let binaryOp = multiply let x = binaryOp(3, 5) 
Thank you! That makes sense.
Well done!
You can use an enum for that. There are two states. Good luck!
üëç
Haven't used URLSession at all, so, no.
u/SpaceHonk offers a good solution. The reason you're approach won't work is that it lacks any type information. The multiplication function for two Ints or two Doubles are different functions. So the code `var mathOperator = *` is ambiguous. Which function is it pointing to?
Of course you can‚Äòt do that, S would have different method signatures which `Foo` requires for every different implementor you assign to `foo`. The thing that is missing is: let foo: Foo&lt;Type&gt; The way it‚Äòs currently solved is by making the class generic and binding said generic variable to Foo‚Äòs T so T is always well-defined.
You're missing the `_ ` before the parameter names. This works: func multiply(_ a: Double, _ b: Double) -&gt; (result: Double, op: String) { return (a * b, "*") } func add(_ a: Double, _ b: Double) -&gt; (result: Double, op: String) { return (a + b, "+") } func subtract(_ a: Double, _ b: Double) -&gt; (result: Double, op: String) { return (a - b, "-") } func divide(_ a: Double, _ b: Double) -&gt; (result: Double, op: String) { return (a / b, "/") } let a = 3.0 let b = 5.0 let op = multiply let expr = op(3, 5) print("\(a) \(expr.op) \(b) = \(expr.result)") 
It does indeed. Thank you again!
You need to add an @IBOutlet of type UITableView in the ViewController.
oh yeah! I forgot to reconnect the messageTableView to the storyboard after i changed the name, Thank You rorogadget!
Good ole IBOutlets causing trouble as usual.
haha yeah
In your example, counted is not modified: &gt; func countThree(from start: Int) -&gt; (Int, Int, Int) { &gt; let counted = (start, start + 1, start + 2) &gt; return counted &gt; } &gt; &gt; print(countThree(from: 5)) // (5, 6, 7) func countThreePlusOne(from start: Int) -&gt; (Int, Int, Int) { var counted = (start, start + 1, start + 2) counted.0 += 1 counted.1 += 1 counted.2 += 1 return counted } 
It just needs a type hint: let mathOperation: (Double, Double) - &gt; Double = (*)
No need to over-complicate with extra functions. Just use the operators directly: let mathOperation: (Double, Double) - &gt; Double = (*)
Strings. Indicies, Ranges, Slicing, coding challenges always have some "do this with a String" in them
Great blog! Learned a few new things. Looking forward to new entries!
I'm British. Please don't compliment me. My people don't like that.
Sure, that works too. Like I said, it doesn't really matter if it's declared a constant or a variable inside the function when it returns.
Key-value coding compliant is almost always due to nib outlet errors.
&gt; If you declare an optional variable (var), the compiler will initialize the value to nil for your ~~pleasure~~ convenience. I did not know this. Frankly I'm surprised the language allows for this.
ohh okay, thanks! I will keep note of that for the future! :D
&gt; let (name, age) = person This is commonly called *destructuring*. What I've long been looking for is destructuring with nil passthrough. e.g. let person: (String, Int)? let (name: String?, age: Int?) = person But sadly this isn't supported in Swift.
Closures are basically just functions than can be passed around like any other data. Sometimes you want to pass an integer around; sometimes you want to pass a chunk of logic around. Some common scenarios when that's useful: * perform &lt;action closure&gt; after &lt;x&gt; seconds * when I click &lt;x&gt;, do &lt;some action closure&gt; * once the network request finishes, do &lt;closure that handles the data&gt; * for every &lt;x&gt; in a list, do &lt;something to x&gt; There are usually other ways to achieve the same result, of course, but closures can often be the most concise way.
&gt;A tuple can contain two or more values Um, 0 or more values. #!/usr/bin/env swift let tup: () = () print(tup) 
Darn, missed out. If anyone could PM me a Dropbox link or something, I'd be most grateful.
If you‚Äôre trying to be pedantic, the answer is any non-negative cardinality except 1 is supported.
&gt;If you‚Äôre trying to be pedantic, the answer is any non-negative cardinality except 1 is supported. Oh? #!/usr/bin/env swift let tupleOfOneElement = (content: 200) let oneElementFromTuple = tupleOfOneElement.content print(oneElementFromTuple) Why does that work, then? You were saying? 
I see! Thank you. 
I‚Äôm away from Xcode right now but couldn‚Äôt you do let (name, age) = person as? (String?, Int?)
I think you should start it. Step up the game, mane!
webview.delegate = self
oh I meant webview.delegate, not webview.self, edited
Actually there's a lot of work in this area since Chris Lattner started working for Google. The work is all open source and the appropriate hooks are being moved into Swift: https://github.com/tensorflow/swift
Ok and where did you implement startLoading() ?
I implemented it on my VC. I also used a breakpoint at where I implemented webViewDidStartLoad but it looks like it's not getting called.
I did call webview.loadRequest that, this is only a portion of my code. Sorry if I was being unclear.
Yes I should have migrated to WKWebView at all, this is only a solution for when I need to set http body to my WKWebView. I tried with WKWebView and failed, haven't found the solution yet. So I use both. I know this is a bad implementation but.. And yes I get the warning also. Anyway, in the end, I did what you suggested, implement my delegates methods inside my ViewControllers. The thinking process behind why we used protocol for this is there will be more than one ViewController that uses these delegates so we created a protocol and implement the methods once instead of implementing each method on each ViewController. But if there is no better solution, then I will implement it on each ViewController. Thanks for the help, I will surely migrate to WKWebView but slowly haha
Got it, anyone know how good this book is? Maybe someone has read it before.
Good luck :D

As per the other comments, a tuple cannot contain 1 element. I deliberately separated the concept of an empty tuple in the article, as a tuple with values and an empty tuple are different concepts, really: the presence of a value and the (deliberate) absence of a any value.
I use them everywhere possible. Every time a View changes state you can do it with an enum for example, like": [https://www.raywenderlich.com/5542-enum-driven-tableview-development](https://www.raywenderlich.com/5542-enum-driven-tableview-development) &amp;#x200B; It works really well with functional programming as you don't leave a lot of space for ambiguous state to creep into your program.
Thanks!
Someone created an HTML generator in swift using enums. Then used that to create their website. I watched them recreate it at our cocoaheads meetup. Pretty cool. https://github.com/Nashville-Swift/hype/blob/master/Hype/Node.swift

That sounds really interesting, I bet someone video taped the presentation and maybe it could be posted somewhere.
That is super nice and clean. I might nick it
That is pretty awesome. The calculator project in the Stanford iOS course on iTunes U also uses enum associated values in a very cool way. I wouldn‚Äôt do it justice (he‚Äôs using them as part of a look up table) but you should check it out if you haven‚Äôt seen it already. 
They are really powerful. Writing parsers with them is a joy. It‚Äôs the combination of `enum` and `case let` that makes them awesome.
This is an example of raw values and a computed property, not associated values. 
They are commonly used for function results. NoError with the result object or Error with the error value. 
I remember that, it took a min to wrap the mind around that.
Heterogenous arrays sort of.
This does not answer the question. There is no use of associated types here. If one was to know they would need a string to add to the path in the case of ‚Äúhome‚Äù (maybe something that identifies who the user is or if they want a dark theme or light theme) THAT could be added as an associated type. Then, any use of the enum could also access that associated data to build the URL
In case it's useful, my talk at NSSpain this year was about problems users hit when learning Swift and what it tells us about the language: https://vimeo.com/291590798
As others mentioned, I too use enum+associated values for network API, usually to associate URLs/Strings with callback functions, or to other enums/tuples 
I‚Äôve used associated values when saving session data between app opens. Stuff like user id, user name, but when there are different types of accounts (here it was normal users, or merchant users). So in one go I can save the TYPE of user that was last logged in AND the type-specific necessary info :) enum SessionLast: Codable, Equatable { case sessionUser(User), sessionMerchant(Merchant) 
Simple example: say you have an app with a feed, like say twitter or something and you can either view the default feed or filter the feed by a particular hashtag. enum FeedMode { case unfiltered case hashtag(String) } Now when you change the mode of the feed, the enum value will contain ALL of the information needed to adjust your network calls, predicates, etc.
I believe they did. Let me reach out to them and see if I can get it! 
You use them to replace simple class hierarchies that are mostly used to hold data and for which you don't really need polymorphism. For instance, you could conceptually model `Optional&lt;T&gt;` as: ```swift class Optional&lt;T&gt; { func unwrap() -&gt; T { fatalError("implemented in subclass") } } class OptionalSome&lt;T&gt;: Optional&lt;T&gt; { let value: T func unwrap() -&gt; T { return value } } class OptionalNone&lt;T&gt;: Optional&lt;T&gt; { func unwrap() -&gt; T { fatalError("does not contain a value") } } ``` Of course, enums have value semantics, so you don't need to allocate an object just to hold (or not hold) a value.
Index path has ‚Äú3‚Äù cars that you should print instead of the object: Item Section Row Print out ‚Äòrow‚Äô instead.
Ohh! Thanks rorogadget again!
No problem!
Just curious (and not thinking this through very much), is a Result.success/error type an anti-pattern now that you can throw (and rethrow from closures) error types?
It can definitely have 0 elements. Void, for example, as you state later in the article. I understand you are saying now you separated the concepts deliberately, but I think the initial statement at the top is wrong and confusing. 
I disagree. I think it‚Äôs confusing to say to people, ‚Äúa tuple can have 0, 2, or more than 2 elements, it can‚Äôt have one, but it can because of a compiler error, but it shouldn‚Äôt be possible, and 0 really represents the absence of a value, the concept of void really, and it can have two or more to enable functions to return multiple values.‚Äù That‚Äôs a mess for someone trying to learn something new. Tuples can have 2 or more values **and** there is a special case where they can have zero in order to represent the concept of void. Pedantry has no place in education.
You should start with the assumption ‚Äúthis should be an enum‚Äù and then migrate away when you have too many switch statements or it‚Äôs too cumbersome to use. Basically, they are a convenient ‚Äúclosed class‚Äù system. Once you reach a certain complexity or need to support outside options, you should look into making a base class or protocol. An example of a good use case imo is a system where you support 5 data types for something. IE: your own database field value type.
by the way rorogadget, what is the difference between section and row?
Inside Table View you can group cells in sections. A good example is iPhone settings app. When you open it you can see grouped cells and a white space between groups. The groups are sections and cells represent rows inside a section.
A table view can have multiple sections, each section having their own rows (indexed at 0). To help differentiate this, index paths have both a row (or item if using collection view) property AND a section property. You can specify the number of sections and number of rows per section in the delegate / datasource methods
And the third one, `item` is the same as row, but when you're using collection views instead of table views.
ohh! Okay! Thanks 0hmtscience
I‚Äôve built out a simple model on my MacBook with a playground. It‚Äôs not well trained, but the process was surprisingly easy to follow and build. I think with better training data I could have had better results. But I agree, Apple is making it easier to add this sort of thing to projects with all the CoreML stuff added in these iOS and macOS updates. 
&gt;a tuple can have 0, 2, or more than 2 elements, it can‚Äôt have one... Yes that is confusing, but that's on the language, reason being that the language design is violating [zero, one, infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_one_infinity_rule). It's up to the writer of a document to explain in a way that at least does not add further confusion by, for example, making misleading and contradictory statements. 
**Zero one infinity rule** The Zero one or infinity (ZOI) rule is a rule of thumb in software design proposed by early computing pioneer Willem van der Poel. It argues that arbitrary limits on the number of instances of a particular entity should not be allowed. Specifically, an entity should either be forbidden entirely, only one should be allowed, or any number of them should be allowed. Although various factors outside that particular software could limit this number in practice, it should not be the software itself that puts a hard limit on the number of instances of the entity. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/swift/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
nice try, pajeet
I‚Äôm with you on generics. I think it‚Äôs the area that needs the most work. I mean, I love Swift‚Äôs generics, but there are some serious pain points. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd use reflection too much. And, yeah, I can‚Äôt imagine using it as a scripting language. I‚Äôd rather reach for Ruby or Python.
An empty tuple contains no values. It represents a deliberate absence of values. When you specify an empty tuple, you are saying to the consumer of the API, ‚Äúdo not expect a value, this API returns no value‚Äù. That is void (note my lack of capitalisation). That is the concept of void. Nothingness. No things. Nada. Rein. Void. I believe the simplest way to communicate that to someone learning about tuples for the first time, is to say... A tuple can contain two or more values **and** there is a special case where a tuple can contain zero values to represent the concept of void. You keep talking about being confused. Who is confused? You‚Äôre not. It‚Äôs patronising to assume other people are confused. And once again, &gt; Pedantry has no place in education.
Make sure you are setting the `TableViewControllerDelegate` and `TableViewControllerDataSource`
You‚Äôre not providing a cell to the table. You need to implement [cellForRowAt](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitableviewdatasource/1614861-tableview) in MasterViewController. It‚Äôs a required method on the data source. If your viewcontroller formally adopted the UITableViewDataSource protocol, the compiler would warm you that it was missing.
If you‚Äôre using a UITableViewController then you don‚Äôt need to explicitly set these properties. It happens automatically. 
Depends. As a return value, maybe. In this case its a parameter to a callback closure though, which is called asynchronously -- there is no way to throw into the closure.
&gt; There is a personal skill involved in knowing how to accept feedback from people on your work. You have not yet learned this skill, I would say. That's fine. Just saying, although you can hold your ground on this, there are better ways to handle it imho. The idea that my disagreement with your opinion constitutes an inability on my part to accept feedback is a remarkably arrogant and patronising thing to say. I welcome feedback (even unsolicited feedback, like yours), but I don't have to agree with it. To simply acquiesce to you requires the idea that your feedback is without fault and that you are infallible. Neither of which are true. If I say that the sky is blue, and your feedback is that the sky is red, should I simply agree and begin stating the sky is red? All ideas must stand up to criticism, including your feedback. I'm open to the idea that I'm wrong, or uninformed. But you haven't convinced me of what you believe. Even after an ad hominem attack on my character, I'm still open to you convincing me of what you believe. I didn't solicit your feedback. I didn't agree with your feedback. Your conclusion that I am fault for not simply accepting your opinion betrays your arrogance in believing there is absolutely no possibility that one could find fault in your feedback, and, that your feedback was essential and immediate. &gt; There is a personal skill involved in knowing how to accept feedback from people Perhaps you should look inward. 
&gt;Perhaps you should look inward. Yes, I have much to learn. 
Defining "web framework" would also be good. That sounds server side to me.
what?
what's the diffirence between "curious" and "just curious"? Just curious.
I can‚Äôt tell if you are making a joke about my question or is English not your first language
?
No
Like on a future device? Would be very cool! But you can already ‚Äúcode‚Äù on iPad with the playground app I think. 
I don‚Äôt get why people want to code on iOS. It would be so difficult...I can barely type normal words with autocorrect on.
No one knows outside of Apple at the moment, but I think Xcode will inevitably come to iOS. It is just a matter a time. I wouldn‚Äôt count on it for next WWDC 2019, but maybe WWDC 2020 at the earliest. 2021 or 2022 is more likely. All just guesses at this point though. 
In the future? Sure, it‚Äôs a possibility. There are lots of large things they‚Äôd need to add/change to iOS to make development a real possibility. 
&gt; f-u-n-c d-o-P-r-o-c-e-s-e Dammit no &gt; d-o-P-r-o-c-c-e-s-s *Auto corrects to "dope rockest"* Gaah &gt; d-o- *Accidentally hit newline* FUCK
Well you could get a physical keyboard attachment....
Or, you know, use that device that had a keyboard built into the hardware....
The only way I could see it happen is if Apple intended on iOS (or some variation of it) replacing OSX in the long run. But getting Xcode on the iPad isn‚Äôt the only issue. Most development relies on command line applications, several programming languages and lots of other software. iOS would have to change in some pretty fundamental ways. 
Exactly, and given that the benefits of porting Xcode to iOS would be so minimal I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll see it anytime soon.
I am going to need a way to use cocoapods in it which is a weird thing to think possible for iOS currently. But also iOS ‚ÄúPro‚Äù territory has a lot of room for growth, so I won‚Äôt say never. 3-4+ years could have a lot change, we‚Äôll see. 
Apple sells a hardware keyboard for iPads. Coding would work perfectly fine on it.
It will be some time, before you can compile directly on the iPad, I think. Coding should be possible. There are a few editors on the app store that you can use for that. I read an article about a guy, that tried to do everything on an iPad to see how much of a computer it really is. The conclusion was, that there are possibilities to set this up and it works adequately. You can code on your iPad and then ssh into your build machine. Or you setup a build pipeline with your git repo. However, I think this probably works easiest for web apps, where you can see the result in the browser. I am not sure how you would get the compiled app from your build system onto you iPad. Maybe via Testflight?
I am not sure, but I think you can disable autocorrect for your app. And maybe some editors have a switch for this functionality. Also: if you own the iPad Pro with the physical keyboard, it can be quite productive. I recently bought the iPad 2018 and I am amazed about the possible workflow. It needs a little adjusting, but it can work. And what's for sure: there are people in the world that can't afford different devices and might opt for the iPad instead of a computer. It would be awesome if these kind of people could also use it for everything, including coding.
Double check your "Swift Language Version" under your Target Build Settings. Had this come up after I updated some pods and I was still on Swift 4, updating Swift to 4.2 should work.
The toolchain already runs on an iPad, it really is the development paradigm and environment that would have to be rethought even if you were to add mouse support to iOS. Mouse support wouldn't be required, but without it even more rethinking of often simple stuff that is taken for granted now (ex. resizing a visual element) would be needed.
Coding is not a problem, I am already using coda2, but I mean real development 
If Tim Cook really meant for iPad to be laptop replacement, this would be it.
No, that does't work, because `person as? (String?, Int?)` has the type `(String?, Int?)?`. That last `?` keeps you from using destructuring. You could do this though: `let (name, age) = person as? (String?, Int?) ?? (nil, nil)`, which is kinda ugly.
&gt; but I don't have any other examples I've used the empty tuple in a dictionary, eg. `[String: ()]`, to represent a `Set&lt;String&gt;` before `Set` was added to Swift. Not needed any more obviously, but it was a use of the empty tuple.
Thanks for pointing out the UIImage mistake. I was following a tutorial and clearly wasn't spending enough time breaking down the logic of what I was doing. &amp;#x200B; I'm still having trouble with the VC. I've decided to shelve the summary view controller and have opted for a second view that is hidden until I need to see the summary. This works so I'll stick with it in the meantime and revisited the VC issue a little down the line. 
Actually, you can use good ol‚Äô optional binding instead. if let (name, age) = person as? (String?, Int?) { ... } It makes perfect sense that you are not able to decompose an optional tuple whose value is, in fact, null. You therefore check for non-nullity first.
Then turn it off? Even macOS has autocorrect on by default. Don‚Äôt let that stop you. Coding on an iPad Pro is not such a far-fetched feature request when you can already attach a keyboard on it. The only reason it can‚Äôt be done on an iPad is that iOS does not have Xcode, but there is nothing stopping Apple from doing that. Writing code on a computer with a tablet form factor is feasible.
I agree that it makes sense that only tuples can be destructured, not optional tuples. However, it's still useful to be able to destructure an optional of a tuple into optionals of the tuple's elements. Your if-let does something different, btw: OP wants `name` and `age` to be nil if the optional is nil. Your if let just doesn't execute if the optional is nil, and `name` and `age` will never be nil at runtime within the if let - casting to `(String?, Int?)` makes no sense in this context.
Look at OP's original code: let person: (String, Int)? let (name: String?, age: Int?) = person The problem with the second line is that he is assigning an optional tuple to a non-optional tuple. This is basic Swift. It is correct that the second line is illegal. If OP wants name and age to be nil when person is nil, then the correct declaration would be: let (name: String?, age: Int?)? = person Which is still utterly ugly because now you have to unwrap this new optional tuple of optionals. The primary issue here is that OP's mental model of his code is incorrect. You can only decompose a tuple that is not null, period. That is an undebatable axiom. If you want to use null as a default value for the element of a tuple where the tuple itself is null, you have to write the code in some other way, such as: let (name, age): (String?, Int?) = { if let (name, age) = person as? (String?, Int?) { return (name, age) } return (nil, nil) }() I honestly think that the above is still complicated and unnecessary to the business rule that OP is trying to achieve. He's better off using guard than if, declari name and age as standalone optional vars, or perhaps he can use value binding and decomposition in smart switch statements, but there's not enough information on what he's trying to achieve and why he can't just simplify his approach instead of going for syntactic sugar.
Should show up as a suggestion with the name you assigned it in the assets
Unfortunately this is one of those weird scenarios. I would either use a completion block on your animation for the scroll or use dispatchAfter and time it so your animation completes prior to transitioning to next view. 
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit: - [/r/iosprogramming] [collectionview cell scrolls before the animation is completed and sleep() function doesn't work either](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/9ocbjw/collectionview_cell_scrolls_before_the_animation/) &amp;nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
You set the image of the button, not the asset library.
Hmm. You're right. I had an issue earlier in the year where I had a fully constrained protocol (derived from some "base" protocol) and I wasn't able to use it where I expected to. I'm going to have to look through my notes and see what the issue was, exactly, because I really thought it was this...
Because my iPad actually can go everywhere with me, doesn't have the boot up time of a laptop, can fit in many spaces which would be awkward for a laptop, has a much better battery life, and is better for my workflow. Just because you can't type on an iPad doesn't mean other people can't. Autocorrect can be turned off and depending on the app you actually can get a good chunk of IDE features like autocomplete suggestions. There are also multiple known instances of people coding full apps on an iPad and using a Mac for compilation. 
To clarify, I‚Äôm try set the image of a button to an image in my Asset.xcassets folder. 
I‚Äôm not sure, I guess. I was under the impression that I should store my applications internal images there.
Just a Note: i would recommend Not to use dispatchAfter. You Never if this is executed properly. Rather use a completion block like shagans Mentioned. 
i am using completion block and its not working
I think your problem is that `animateLoadingBar` will return immediately because the animation happens asynchronously. You need to place `self.performSegue(withIdentifier: "goTo", sender: self)` in the completion block of `animateLoadingBar(row: indexPath.row)`
thats a different viewcontroller the switching is happenning between collectionView cells
Thanks. Doesn‚Äôt Swifty discontinued in favor of Mimo? Also, I couldn‚Äôt find any competitive element in Mimo, or it solely for premium version? 
You can use an image literal, #imageLiteral(resourceName: ‚Äú‚Äù) Or a UIImage initializer, UIImage(imageLiteralResourceName: ‚Äú‚Äù) where, in both cases, the string is the same name as it appears in the asset catalog.
There‚Äôs already Swift Playgrounds, but I assume you mean building and shipping an app.
You'll have to say what kind of information you want to gather.
this is the second time i've seen you in this subreddit asking for "exact solutions" hoping someone will type out the answer for you. spend some more time researching the problem....
Some of the OS X command line utilities are open sourced. Check to see if system_profiler is there, and if so, it'll have all the calls it's making. There's nothing wrong with tasking out to run a helper utility. Well so long as it's not in a tight loop :-) 
&gt;y &gt; &gt;share &gt; &gt;report &gt; &gt;Save i wrote it: SPDisplaysDataType, that means I need to gather the video information
I am running in a thread so seems to be fast and responsive. I guess I will stay with your opinion because I really don't want to dig on system\_profiler, I am a vey newbie with Swift and I can cry if I see the OS X source lol
Thank you! This worked. Initially, it threw a `Thread 1: EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION (code=EXC_I386_INVOP, subcode=0x0)` error but, as /u/lucasvandongen suggested, I removed all spaces and special characters that were exported from Affinity Designer.
That's a good point. I just kept the names that I had set on Affinity Designer since they were automatically exported. I'll have to start remove spaces and special characters within Affinity Designer as well.
You can get some of that information through [`NSScreen`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsscreen). I'll have to see where to find the rest of it. Do you need all of the info in SPDisplaysDataType or just certain parts of it? 
I got you, boo.
But mouse
Probably because `DOFavoriteButton` is using a CALayer animation which is not going to work with your standard UIView animation completion block. Your best bet is probably to add a delay either using `dispatch_after` or a library like `SwiftyTimer` Sidenote: as u/[dedicated2fitness](https://www.reddit.com/user/dedicated2fitness) said you really should try and do some more thorough research before posting a question on reddit/SO and asking for exact answers. It only took me a few minutes to look at the `DOFavoriteButton` source code and do some googling to find an answer. You probably could have saved yourself a lot of time and stress :)
True, it would be a pain in the ass to code without a mouse. Trying to touch a sliver between lines of code by touch or stylus would not be fun. I think if they truly want the iPad to be a computer replacement they need desktop class web browsers and mouse support. These mobile versions of browsers just can't do everything yet. 
I agree with this approach. Every time I have some value, I ask myself whether the value must be within some finite set of things. Many times the answer is "yes", so I use an Enum. Like, sometimes you have a number and it could be pretty much any number, so you use an Int or a UInt, or whatever. But sometimes you have an error code, so you're better off using an Enum since there's a finite number of error codes you might define. &amp;#x200B;

What a bunch of bullshit lol. The MBA is only 3cm wider (but still smaller than A4) and the MB is smaller in width and depth. Both are max. 1cm higher compared to a iPad Pro 12.9". If the iPad Pro has a keyboard the height is about the same. As for the weight, it's only 600/200g (without keyboard). But you need a keyboard because besides the typing experience you'd want to be able to see larger parts of your code/UI. The boot up time is negligible because you don't have to shut down your device - you can just wake it up from sleep...
A combination of learning Swift and iOS development.
Without seeing your code it's hard to say where exactly you went wrong. A quick skim of your post leads me to think that you have either A) Poor data structure on firebase and/or B) Aren't using a struct and instead are using a class. For displaying the image of the cell you tap you should be using a "func collectionView" stub with a gesturerecognizer added to cells. The cell being displayed isn't random. You should be able to use indexPath.item data to create a new VC with the correct image. [This](https://medium.com/@foffer/easily-parse-firebase-object-in-swift-bfe151eada41) quick article would also be a good read for you as it looks like you don't have a firm grasp on structuring the snapshop data you are receiving. If none of my guess are correct and it doesn't help, DM me and I'll take a look at your code.
&gt; I seem to be doing a lot of data conversions. There's nothing inherently wrong with that. In many cases, the way data is structured in a service API (or a database) is not the way you want to represent the data in your model layer and/or UI. That can be because of data normalization, changing requirements, or simply different goals. Concepts like a ViewModel exist to mediate those kinds of interactions but that's not the only approach. &gt; The arrays within the dictionary created in step 2 are populated in a random order so that "apple" isn't always the first entry That is expected. *Dictionaries are inherently unordered*. If you want to extract the data in a particular sequence, you need to get a copy of [keys](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/dictionary/keys) and then sort them. And then pass them back to the dictionary one at a time to get the related value. Or use some other kind of data object. What you really need to do is make your own data structure instead of relying on dictionaries. Something like this (the details would depend on your specific needs): struct Picture { var url: URL var image: UIImage? } struct PictureCategory { var name: String var pictures: [Picture] } You transform the snapshot into an array of 'PictureCategory' objects representing the sections in the collection view. Then, when the user taps a cell, you pass the category for that section along with the cell's row as an index to the full screen view controller. That VC can then start with the 'Picture' at that index and go forward/back through all of the others in the parent category. There are issues around struct vs. class and mutability and how to download the image but hopefully that gives you something to think about.

Why do I need a keyboard? I can type just fine, with both accuracy and speed, without one. Is it the fastest typing on earth? Nope. But it‚Äôs fast enough for my purposes. Using Codea I can see the majority of my code on the bus and train I take to and from work, compiles just fine on the ailing Mac mini I have at home (and I‚Äôm testing the rent a Mac in the cloud service I recently found) and can run my code easily. If I needed a keyboard, I wouldn‚Äôt have stated what I did because you‚Äôre absolutely correct - having a keyboard would cause the majority of my post to be total bullshit. Once you add a keyboard you have the same problems as with a laptop, because then you need to tile the screen, which causes problems on tightly packed busses and trains (and economy airline seating) with the bumps moving the screen and so on. If you need a keyboard for your code work, then yeah, a MacBook would be the better choice overall. 
You can buy an Xserve for like 90 bucks lol it‚Äôs not pretty but it would work just fine 
How much would that be, just an estimate?
Hey, thanks for the reply. You're probably spot on with your guess on my grasp of structuring the data :). Thanks for the link, I'll check it out and see how I go and if I get stuck I may get in touch. In regards to the Firebase structure, I decided on a structure where all images are stored in a child, with a UID as the child key, and then data about the image (e.g URL and description) residing within. For example: Image &gt; UID.key &gt; imageData Then to access the image data and track the category membership, I have something like follows: Apple &gt; UID.key.1: true \&gt; UID.key.2: true Banana &gt; UID.key.1: true \&gt; UID.key.2: true This way, if I want to get all 'Apple' images I can grab the keys under 'Apple' and iterate through them to find the image via UID.Key and grab the data for each image. I also grab the 'parent key' the child resides in to obtain the category name (apple, banana, pear, etc). The data for each image is then put in the dictionary I mentioned in my original post, as follows: \["apple": \[bowl.fruitItem\], "orange": \[bowl.fruitItem, bowl.fruitItem, bowl.fruitItem, bowl.fruitItem\], "banana": \[bowl.fruitItem\], "pear": \[bowl.fruitItem, bowl.fruitItem\]\] I don't know if this is a good, or bad database design. I've tried a lot of different ways, and this way seemed the easiest for me to understand while keeping the database structure flat, somewhat self organised, and without duplicating data anywhere.
Mainly the information about display resolution, monitor attached with serial number. I tried reading the NSScreen but found it confusing comparing with the other class objects. I really appreciate any help and or tip :)
Hello, thanks for the reply. &gt;There's nothing inherently wrong with that I feel like in this case I am relying on converting the data rather than figuring out how to structure it properly in the first place. Though I've tried to structure it properly initially, I'm getting lost with snapshots, dictionaries, arrays, and 2D arrays, and get tangled up. Ultimately I just need to take some more time learning the fundamentals, but I need some help with some concepts / data designs I think, and I don't have anyone to discuss this stuff with, so even writing about it here is helping. &gt;What you really need to do is make your own data structure instead of relying on dictionaries That is very helpful. It never occurred to me to structure the data like this. I don't think I've seen an example (or seen it and understood what I was looking at, and how it might relate to what I was trying to do) of using a struct to define an object, then use that object within another struct, like you've shown here. It definitely gives me something to think about. Thanks!
i have already spent most of the time on this problem and the solutions suggested by others are not working. 
At this point you should be able to cop one for less than 500 maybe even way cheaper. I haven‚Äôt really looked lately. 
&gt; I feel like in this case I am relying on converting the data rather than figuring out how to structure it properly in the first place. That is a concern, but my point is that the needs of an app are different than the needs of Firebase (or other database/service) and the best way to represent data in one context isn‚Äôt always the same as another. So some degree of transformation can be necessary and even good. (It‚Äôs all about the trade offs) And of course sometimes you have to work with an API that you don‚Äôt control so have to adapt to it. Now, if you are transforming the data repeatedly *within* the app just to pass the data around than that is a separate issue.
updated it to swidt 4.2 :( 
I'd also look into firestore instead of firebase. I've built projects on both and I prefer firestore although it isn't as fast. As long as your app isn't real time messaging or the likes you should be safe with firestore. Firestore has shallow queries that are much easier to work with. 
You just download from Apple's site. Here's a few links. You basically lookup your hardware (board, video, chip, etc...) then you make a bootable USB drive. https://hackintosher.com/guides/make-macos-flash-drive-installer/ then install onto your HD. Usually you'll have to play with the settings and those tend to be specific to the hardware. Sound and video are some key things. I had to go from USB 3 to USB 2 on my board last time. TonyMaxX86 is a great place to find the tutorials, look up your board in the forums. https://www.tonymacx86.com/ https://lifehacker.com/the-always-up-to-date-guide-to-building-a-hackintosh-o-5841604 https://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;source=hp&amp;ei=dGDFW5jDFc2_0wL3lajgCQ&amp;q=how+to+build+a+hackintosh&amp;btnK=Google+Search&amp;oq=how+to+build+a+hack&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.0l10.1628.4913..6253...0.0..0.257.1610.19j0j1......0....1..gws-wiz.....0..35i39j0i131j0i20i264j0i20i263j0i20i263i264.zo8cI9lOgFY
Should be as easy as: import Foundation import PlaygroundSupport PlaygroundPage.current.needsIndefiniteExecution = true if let url = URL(string: "https://your.url/resource") { var request = URLRequest(url: url) request.httpMethod = "DELETE" URLSession(configuration: .default) .dataTask(with: request) { (_, response, error) -&gt; Void in guard error == nil else { print("Error:", error ?? "") return } guard let httpResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse else { print("Bad response") return } switch httpResponse.statusCode { case 200: print("OK") case 202: print("Accepted") case 204: print("No Content") default : print("Unsuccessful") } } .resume() } This doesn't decode the returned body because these cover the [required responses](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html).
For the record, put and post are not the same thing. Put is supposed to be idempotent
Neither did I until Googled it
&gt;That is a concern, but my point is that the needs of an app are different than the needs I understand your point, thanks. &gt;Now, if you are transforming the data repeatedly *within* the app just to pass the data around than that is a separate issue. Yep, this is what I feel like I've been doing lately, and I'd become fatigued with it, and stuck. &amp;#x200B;
I‚Äôve definitely seen, more with Swift than many other languages, folks get too zealous with functional features that make the code much more difficult to understand. Stuff like (try? mightThrow()).flatMap { $0.reduce([], +) } Like, it‚Äôs great that the language features are there to support all of these abstractions, but sometimes things are not clearer declaratively.
You shouldn‚Äôt need a bridging header to use it from Swift. import Darwin let password = String(cString: getpass("Password: "))
Yes I know playground ... I mean coding building compiling 100 % on iPad 
on mobile so formatting might be a bit off 
scoreLbl.text = "\\(Score)" highscoreLbl.text = "\\(Highscore)" \[use backward slash in both cases.\] Do you see any error in the console? I don't really see anything wrong here.
You're posting a bunch of CSS with your code. What framework are you using, if any? This is obviously relevant to your problem.
interestingly, there is no error, it just won‚Äôt go away. if i do delete the launch screen, the main.storyboard won‚Äôt load
there is one error: thread 1: signal SIGBART
Grab a 2012 model with a quad core then throw in a ssd and 16gb of ram and you will be golden
Thats a very common issue with beginners. I had it too. At this stage it mostly happens when you have misconnected an outlet. I cant go through what you've done without your seeing your entire project but most likely thats the issue. If I were to guess you could have misconnected the reset and tap button. But thats just a guess. I re did your code and you don't really need those buttons outlets to be able to do what I think you want to do. Here is my version of the code: &amp;#x200B; import UIKit class ViewController: UIViewController { override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib. } @IBOutlet weak var scoreLabel: UILabel! // connect this to the label for score @IBOutlet weak var highScoreLabel: UILabel! //connect this to the label for highScore var score = 0 var highScore = 0 @IBAction func resetScore() { // connect this to the button for resetScore score = 0 scoreLabel.text = "\(score)" } @IBAction func tapAction() { // connect this to the button for tapAction score += 1 scoreLabel.text = "\(score)" if score &gt; highScore { highScore = score highScoreLabel.text = "\(highScore)" } } } &amp;#x200B;
When checking your outlets as the reply indicated, look on the page with the IBOutlet code and the circle to the left of the outlet by the line number should be filled in. If it isn‚Äôt, go to Storyboard and right click on the corresponding outlet. If there is anything there, delete the outlet and reconnect it.
I'm willing to bet that iOS (or at least the iPad) will have [cursor support](https://daringfireball.net/2017/05/ipad_trackpad) within the next three years.
Ideally, by the time Xcode comes to the iPad, CocoaPods will be a thing of the past and Swift Package Manager support will be built in to the app.

Wonderful - should make server Swift much more viable. Since XCode is not a great tool for backend Swift, many poor devs are trying to write their backend Swift in Atom, VSCode or Sublime, mixing and matching all the poorly-supported tooling or just making do with syntax highlighting and nothing else. Better tooling would make Swift far more ergonomic on many more editors.
As someone using Swift to target Linux this is huge. Now I'm just waiting on better support for building on/for Windows
Change: &gt;**showMessage("esi")** to &gt;showMessage(message: "esi") &amp;#x200B;
I read the docs, to run the put, you just change the http method. I am asking about the delete specifically..... I couldn‚Äôt find any docs for that.
Thank you.
Argument labels are part of the method signature. However, you can remove it from being required to call the method with the `_`. ``` func showMessage(_ message: String) { // do something } // later in code showMessage(‚Äúmy message‚Äù) ```
Do you know what the obstacles are for non-Ubuntu Swift?
So you know, the playground stuff is in there just so that people can test it in a playground. You can remove them if there are no playgrounds involved.
It will probably have a tvOS-like trackpad. Not a mouse on the screen. 
probably not diving deep enough
Yes, that‚Äôs what the article says‚Ä¶
If you're making the art then it's your product. Do graphic designers owe any money to Adobe for using Photoshop? No. It's just a medium.
I would guess that the Swift LSP is a small piece of the puzzle that would make better support for Android and Windows more viable. Realistically, it‚Äôs not going to impact that goal directly, but it makes those platforms better options, since you will soon be able to write Swift on those platforms with the same, fully featured IDE support as is provided with Xcode.
I would also love to see better support for compiling Android business logic frameworks. Using the same (`Codable`!) model framework on all of your client and server apps is the dream, but in order to port their core framework for Android, [Reedle had to go so far as forking the compiler](https://blog.readdle.com/why-we-use-swift-for-android-db449feeacaf) üòï
Thank you!
As awesome as this is, I can‚Äôt help but be very interested in the ‚ÄúC-family languages‚Äù part of this project, as well. Getting Xcode-level support for Objective-C tooling on any other platform is an interesting proposition indeed. I wonder if it will spark any resurgence in the GNUstep community‚Ä¶
Hi Rednaxila! Unfortunately, the link to the App Store you submitted has been automatically removed from /r/Swift. This is because ‚Äì generally speaking ‚Äì compiled products are not relevant to /r/Swift (even if the app was originally written in Swift). If this is an app you have written, congrats on your acceptance to the App Store! A great way to promote it would be [Reddit advertising](https://www.reddit.com/advertising). If you would like to release its Swift source code, we would gladly accept a link to that. If the content you were submitting *was* in fact related to the subject of Swift programming, please [message the moderation team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fswift&amp;subject=Please%20review%20my%20removed%20App%20Store%20submission&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/9oqgys/are_there_any_modern_anticrackantipiracy/) to have it reviewed.

Have you thought of implementing monthly subscription in your app and use server side validation? This would make it way harder for the hacker to crack it.
You more so have to be mindful of other content you use in those apps to build your interfaces. For instance if you used an image or icon set from someone on DeviantArt, you‚Äôd have to check the usage rights to make sure you aren‚Äôt liable to them for anything or if you need to credit them somewhere.
Its a shame we have to have this discussion - people should respect the time and effort that goes into making a quality application. That said - the reality is that nothing can prevent cracking of the app and its eventual pirating. You can slow it down maybe. I honestly believe the best answer it to make it non-protected, price it right, make it easy to find and buy legally and keep the software as simple and enjoyable as possible. Studies (I do not have the references at the moment) that lowering the barriers to purchase and use software goes a long way to cutting back on piracy. The people who would have stole it will anyway. Make the path simple for the folks who are willing to pay - maybe they will rave about it enough to make more sales.
Oh - so here is another thought about piracy and protecting your software. Certainly more risky, but I remember a game company that released their steam game and with in a day or so it was on all the torrents. They released several additional versions of the game, each with built in issues (the game play was harder, or it crashed - you get the idea) into the piracy channels and torrents. It made it unreliable to download since the person grabbing the torrent did not know whether the version they were getting was tainted or not. This has a high risk to it, as it could poison real legitimate sales by effecting the games reputation based on its pirated versions limitations.

Highly recommend the Swift by Sundell newsletter: https://www.swiftbysundell.com/newsletter Great content released monthly!!
A `UIGestureRecognizer` has a reference to the view that it's attached to (the `view` property), so if you have a reference to the buttons, you can use the `===` identity operator.
It's fantastic. I've used cocos2d and SpriteKit and a few others and it is elegant and sufficient. It also is kinda not part of UIKit so it and SceneKit would be a worthy addition to the cross-platform Swift libraries.
Metal or not, it's an abstraction of 2d stuff.
They're not going to open source their proprietary frameworks, including SpriteKit. Metal or not.
Could you give me an example? I researched the `===` operator at [https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ClassesAndStructures.html#ID90](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ClassesAndStructures.html#ID90), but I didn't see how I would pass a reference.
Thank you this have me a good laugh
I've just finished the basic implementation of my Liquid template language compiler in Swift. It's called (quite appropriately) [LiquidKit](https://github.com/brunophilipe/LiquidKit). I'm working on a Jekyll reimplementation in Swift in order to build a Jekyll app for iOS, and this was the first major step.
