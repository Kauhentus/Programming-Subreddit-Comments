The shills pushing Angela's course :D Do the [iTunes U app dev course](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-11-apps-with-swift/id1309275316) and its prerequisites. Don't bother with udemy crap. They only teach you the barebones and app cloning.
It's really not... the value is actually negative. You'll waste time and learn a lot of bad habits along the way. The Hegarty videos that someone else recommended on YouTube are a much better investment of your time. And/or you can follow the same Stanford course with all the materials in iTunes U. You'll get a structured course from a professional instructor that won't cost you a dime.
I came here specifically to warn people off of Yu's course, and one bit of supporting evidence for that is that I've never actually seen it at a "usual" $200. It's been perpetually discounted to $10 for a year or more, which is still far more than it is actually worth. The pricing is just a marketing gimmick, which is right in line with the rest of the course.
This isn’t really a Swift-specific question. Try a subreddit specifically about iOS/macOS design or user interface design in general.
Build a crawler and scraper to get that info into your own database then use it from there. Realistically you wouldn’t hit multiple apis, accumulate those ratings then show it unless you want to separate the ratings out, but even then having your own database gives you more flexibility.
This deal seems to be part of Udemy’s celebration of hitting some number of students. With that being the case, what are the other arguments against the course? I’ve seen it brought up several times in multiple threads of this type but don’t recall anyone disagreeing with the recommendation. Would love to know more so I can adjust expectations accordingly.
You'll find others disagreeing with the recommendation right here in this sub, if it's just my lonely voice in the wilderness that is bothering you. My specific issues with it is that it's really terribly structured... very nearly just freeform rambling in many places. There's no lesson plan or concept of building foundational knowledge that you can work forward from. Consequently, it also ends up being really disjointed, as she has to back up to go into basic concepts even during the later lessons, stuff that you should have learned right up front. What is worthwhile is often buried by those digressions, and it will take you twice as long to learn it than if she'd presented associated concepts in a really systematic way in the first place. And even if you wanted to jump around, which sometimes make sense if you just want to drill into a specific subject, it's very hard to do because of all the backtracking. Lessons are poorly labeled, too... the MVC content doesn't actually talk about MVC except as a sort of passing reference, for example. But what's worse is that there is a lot of bad coding practices buried in it. Taking MVC as an example, she uses the term to describe what she's doing, but then never actually follows the precepts to decouple the systems. There were a dozen other practices my intro to programming professor would have fainted at as well, but it's been long enough since I looked at the course I can't list them out for you. I think a lot of people still recommend it because they don't really know any better; if I didn't have at least a weak background in computer science, I might not have either. It gives the appearance of having a ton of content and since it's always priced at five or ten bucks (but listed at $200!) it looks like you are getting a rocking value. But most of that content is garbage, and there are better and less expensive ways to learn Swift.
Thanks for the explanation! I (and probably OP) appreciate it. Just in case someone only sees this comment thread, I saw this was your recommendation for an alternative to Yu: &gt; The Hegarty videos that someone else recommended on YouTube are a much better investment of your time. And/or you can follow the same Stanford course with all the materials in iTunes U. You'll get a structured course from a professional instructor that won't cost you a dime. I’ll check ‘em both out!

Saying iPhones don't "support" popovers and then saying the only solution is to roll your own is incorrect. "Modifying UIPopoverPresentationController's default behavior" is actually just a fully-supported, framework-approved way to accomplish it. It would be like saying UIKit doesn't support custom button styles.
Playgrounds is horrible on iPad. Use Xcode instead.
Check with your city or school library. Many libraries have free access to online courses like Lynda.com
The script is pretty small and it's in Swift :) Feel free to test and contribute! Thanks
Uses objC runtime to generate getters, and swizzling awakeFromNib &amp; viewAwoken... Nice idea, but wouldn't use this in production.
This is in fact very cool. I tried something similar after using Kotlin DSLs for a while, but did not make much progress. Thanks!
What are u trying to achieve with a DSL?
&gt;Using associated object via objC runtime, and swizzling awakeFromNib &amp; viewAwoken... Nice idea, but wouldn't use this in production. Care to explain why not?
In the above example, build a UI programmatically. This would allow a program to build a program. An immediate use case I can think of is a program that allows a user to build a UI based on REST API responses. 
Why not just spit out all files needed to reinvent Xcode in Swift? Are you interested in doing something like this. I've been thinking about it, but cant see any purpose to something like this.
Sure, methods swizzling is great for advance debugging things, but I highly prefer having to call myself methods instead of hiding. It can furthermore lead to nightmare debugging things when getting a crash because of an included library. Swizzling such common method can by the way lead to collision with other libs swizzling them. About usage of associated objects, it involves dynamic dispatch instead of statically at compiled time which is not really safe to use in most case. Combining this, I don't see any advantages over binding outlets by hand considering xCode and exception breakpoints greatly help solving any outlets issue (which are not happening that often)
I'm very interested in trying this out. Will probably try out Vapor for a side project once Swift 5 launches.
Type safe, readable, view hierarchy with tree view.
You’ll get destroyed if you start with Stanford’s course if you have no experience
I quite like my own site: [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/) – it's free, it's project-based, and it's fully updated for Swift 4.2. Note: on February 1st I'm starting a new initiative to give folks clearer guidance about how to learn Swift more effectively. [You can find out more here](https://twitter.com/twostraws/status/1086975931543998465?s=20).
Are you talking compile-time or runtime? Swift source code, or some data file? What operating system? This question could mean a dozen different things.
Do you know how to write data to \`stdout\`?
I have written DSLs to have a simple way to add business rules in a simple syntax for non-developers. Something like this (this is built in Groovy): `onUpgrade = {` `reward ("Upgrade to PLUS and get 100 free points") {` `condition {` `toPlan == "PLUS"` `}` `grant {` `points 100` `}` `}` `}`
Would second this. I got started using Hacking with Swift and it's been a solid resource every time I have questions, which is every time I sit down to code. :P
And this used for what now? Why is it Groovy instead of Swift? 
Maybe you could create one class called UserResponses. This will hold all the answers that the user inputs. Then you can pass this userResponses to each of your view controllers. The concept is called Dependency Injection. Let me know if that helps :)
Parts 2 and 3 should be out in short order
I put bits and pieces together. For instance for my characters physics property, I saw a tutorial with a character of almost the same functions as mine, so I just took that over and changed some numbers to fit to my own game. Some other things I put in my codes are some tutorials "world" physics, the codes for layers, the codes for animation etc.. Other than that, the purpose, style, and skins of my game is completely different
I'm not redistributing the code or anything like that. However I am planning to publish on app store. Do you think there should be any type of concern to that?
Thanks for the tip. But I guess what I was trying to ask is, generally is it Ok for people to use other peoples code like so to put up your own app, then publishing it on app store. 
Did you set the Delegate and DataSource for the pickerview?
Yes
I'm developing my first app for iOS. It's called [Feed Viewer](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedviewer) and it is a web browser specialized for reading web articles. I would simply say it is a RSS reader but most people already have a clear imagination what a RSS reader can do and (more importantly) where it has its limits. I don't think that RSS reader should look like an email client and user have to switch to web browser to read full article. I believe that Feed Viewer can do much more than that. I'm planning to release first alpha version to TestFlight during next month.
Why are you using `hashvalue`? You don’t need a static var either. Just use `Gender.allCases.count`as the return value for `numberOfRowsInComponent`
Did you read the release notes? https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode_release_notes/xcode_10_2_beta_release_notes Known Issues Playgrounds might not execute. (47226381)
Playgrounds not working is a known issue in the Xcode 10.2 beta. See the [release notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode_release_notes/xcode_10_2_beta_release_notes): &gt; Playgrounds might not execute. (47226381) 
You also need to make the enum conform to the CaseIterable protocol, but is definitely the right way to do this
Yep, forgot that. Enums backed by associates values might need more to conform. See https://oleb.net/blog/2018/06/enumerating-enum-cases/
FYI you can use raw String values for your enum, obviating the need for your description property. Like: enum Gender: String, CaseIterable { case male = "Male" case female = "Female" }
Hashvalue is definitely wrong, but wouldn't the program crash immediately with an Array/Object index out Bounds as soon as it tries to read the description on an Enum that doesn't exist. Instead he's having nothing showing up, which makes me think that the delegate/datasource isn't setup properly.
I still don't get how this is any better, but thanks for getting back to me.
Where's* Learn how to spell first.
Severe dylexia :/. Although I've worked hard to improve it over the last few years. Coding has helped. 
Nope, unless it also looks like game in tutorials ;) I mean same images etc.

There is a chat section on reddit next to the Messages sectio, click on it and choose the r/iOSProgramming General room.
IOS 12.1, runtime, .scn file to be expact My apologies for not clarifying good enough
I learned swift through Apple’s manual and by making simple apps by scratch. It’s the only way to fully comprehend the language imo. 
You need to loop over all children and find the one you want to delete: for item in snapshot.children { // if item name equals name you are looking to remove { // delete item } } 
Is the framework added as a reference and also set to be embedded (or at least included) in the build settings Search paths, etc... Just some random things to check for...
I'm mobile and can't look at the code exactly but you can simply save the indexPath.item and use it to check if the cell was selected or not.
Coders gonna code, code, code.
Go try to search for something related to Perl. Especially on Twitter. Also might be NSFW.
Just add the Swift version and you shouldn't have issues. 
Not if he wants to use it like this: func pickerView(_ pickerView: UIPickerView, titleForRow row: Int, forComponent component: Int) -&gt; String? { return Gender(rawValue: row)?.description }
This definitely works, you're not far off. Maybe as u/Grymm315 mentioned, the delegate/datasource connections are setup incorrectly? UIViewController: [https://gist.github.com/gdoublev/2cb154208acd3a9b27798fcdf820aa84](https://gist.github.com/gdoublev/2cb154208acd3a9b27798fcdf820aa84) Main.storyboard: [https://gist.github.com/gdoublev/0e4f278a77cb20c3c306665002b49876](https://gist.github.com/gdoublev/0e4f278a77cb20c3c306665002b49876)
are you logged in? google is smart, and tailors to you search habits.
Wait until someone writes a library called Taylor and your boss makes you use it. Deliciously evil.
I believe that’s all correct. I’ve checked and rechecked similar questions on SO. And hacked around on it. But obviously I’m missing something. I’m away from the computer now but maybe I’m missing a recursive setting.
Isn’t that rihanna?
I always google: swift iOS always disambiguates for me
No, the reference is &gt; 'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play &gt; &gt; And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate &gt; &gt; Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake &gt; &gt; Shake it off, shake it off From "Shake It Off", the lead single from Swift's *1989* album.
Oh that makes sense. I guessed it was Rihanna’s “Work”
When reduced to a single-line reference, they can definitely look similar!
Okay, an optional question here: I've just been teaching myself about references by implementing a linked list, and after checking my code against online examples I saw this line: next?.previous = prev Am I right in assuming that the compiler will create a check to ensure that next is not nil before assigning prev to previous? Generally I've understood optionals, but somehow this is breaking my brain. I'd originally written this as: if let next = next { next.previous = prev }
That's until you find Hacking with Swift.
Pun intended?
I think it's actually quite an exciting time for you! You're getting to the stage where you're starting to think about the architecture of your app, and there's a lot of interesting things to learn. I think a good place to start is at the very bottom, with the SOLID Principles of object oriented programming. With Swift, the POP (protocol-oriented programming) way of going about things is also very powerful - and you'll probably want to read up and see how people use that. I'm very hesitant to link to any specific tutorials or websites (everyone learns differently!) but I can recommend going back to something you've made, or making something very simple and just thinking about where you're putting things. Think about MVC and SOLID and just justify to yourself that every bit of code you put down is in the right place. There's a bunch of great tutorials online, but just remember it's not a science - maybe you'll find a nice style of architecting your app that really suits how you code. Definitely have a look at other people's code too! Finally, it may be worth having a look at MVC vs MVVM vs VIPER etc. Even if you don't decide to use something other than MVC, then it's still nice to have some residual knowledge of the others and what they try and address. Especially with relation to testing (if you haven't got round to learning about that, it's probably time too 😉). I think it could be really exciting for you to take a step back and do some reading! This moment is definitely a level up from just learning to code - sounds like you're doing an awesome job.
I failed at making a "try walkedIn() catch trouble" joke but my Swift knowledge is pretty lacking. Think I've only heard the song twice or something.
Again, it depends if the original author gives explicit permission to do so. If they did not specify, then by default they have personal copyright to their work. If they said go ahead (which you can tell by how they license it) then by all means, use the code in your own app and publish!
yep, I've never run into issues with tay showing up in search results. It looks like OP is one of those people that always uses private browsing though.
Bleep bloop, I am a bot. I like turtles and am here to collect some metrics. I will only comment once in every sub, so do not be worried about me spamming your precious subreddit! Goodbye, and have a nice day.
Funny because Taylor was one of the first or second wave libraries written in Swift. Source: https://github.com/izqui/Taylor
I don’t get this &gt;.&lt;
By specifying -Taylor you're telling google to serve up results that match "Swift" but that don't have "Taylor", thereby avoiding Taylor Swift results. 
Clean Build Foldger - and flush derived data ... probably not it, but at least then the slate is clean.
[removed]
Uhh thank you for the clarification. I thought it was a whole different thing and I just didn’t get it. Turns out its a google search word exclusion tag 🙈
Uh... What? I checked your post history, and your goal is to see how many subs you can get banned from? Weird flex but ok.
haha, I remember in the early Swift days when I used to get Taylor Swift's makeup tutorials for searching "Swift tutorials" on YouTube. 
This just in: Taylor Swift donates $100m to build a library for starving orphans. Now how will you find it?
Done that already. Even unplugged it and plugged it back in 😁.
Of course, in her next breakup album.
The first examples and tutorials from Apple all used Taylor Swift or her song title as either variable names or in text strings … so that used not to work. 
wonder why switchresx is not working for you. 
https://github.com/izqui/Taylor https://github.com/jdawe/taylor-swift
If I ever make something usefull. I’m calling it Taylor. And making it comparable in swift 
- Separate your view and controller code. - Split up your view into reusable subviews. - Split up your controller code to multiple controllers and make your VC's only job to connect the appropriate controllers with the appropriate views. Obviously you might have some controllers outside of the views and view controllers, like if you need geofencing, you will probably want a controller class for managing the CLLocationManager calls and responses and providing a consumable input/output for another controller class that sets up the data and forwards the region enter/exit notifications. Those can be separated on a similar basis. There are some patterns that tell you how to group your code. Like the coordinator pattern is really popular right not, the pattern is about collecting all the navigation code of a certain feature into one class, so it's easy to start that feature from anywhere in your app without too many modifications.
I honestly don’t even think I need to do this anymore. Google must have a solid profile of me by now.
As far as your errors go, the first is because you're opening with '{' but closing with a ')'. They need to be uniform and close with an open brace '{' and a closed brace '}'. The warning triangle you're talking about is just telling you that you haven't used the variable yet. I'd say keep following along, however try to find more recent resources, so that you're using the most up-to-date versions. Also, avoid the '!' operator if you can, and use the more reliable \`if let\` or \`guard let\` conventions. It's great that you're learning by doing though, it's one of the best teachers to have.
Ah, you‘re right about the bracket, that‘s from having retyped and deleted that passage several times, I became a little negligent. The error I originally had said “value of type‚‘AppDelegate‘ has no member ‘managedContext‘ “, that‘s how I found that one answer. So you think that I should just go on with the video while having those two lines replaced with what‘s in the answer, and that part will be fine? And thank you for even telling me about something that I wasn‘t asking about (the !), I figured there must be stuff in there that is stupid
He would just modify that code to take advantage of the CaseIterable protocol 
Wow, I'm stupid, you're absolutely right... I didn't even look into the actual benefits of using \`CaseIterable\`. That's so much cleaner... func pickerView(_ pickerView: UIPickerView, titleForRow row: Int, forComponent component: Int) -&gt; String? { return Gender.allCases[row].rawValue } Thanks for the tip man, I'm sorry!
No sorries necessary, this kind of discussion is one of the better ways of learning new stuff 
I think it's okay to use old resources, but just note that some things may not work as originally intended. Especially with how Swift has evolved, there are bound to be some changes necessary. And just like any other programming dialect, you'll have to make changes to fit your needs accordingly anyway. A lot of the time, the older resources can be a total waste of time. But the concepts gained, especially from CoreData, haven't been too large to detract from the current versions itself. I'd just be aware that as you're following along, you may have to update certain things. This is easier for a more seasoned programmer, so it may not be the best thing in your case, but I usually give things a shot anyway if I really enjoy the content.
Okay thank you. I‘d love to use a newer resource, but I haven‘t yet found one doing a similar data logging app
A little late to the party... I started a few days ago on an app. I've been learning Swift on and off for about 3 months. It's my first real project and I have most of it designed already, but I think it would be helpful to work with someone else, either pair programming or contributing thru Github. I have all intentions to ship it to the App Store. I also have a few other app ideas I want to work on after this one as well. lmk what you think!
Highly customizable Enterprise UI Application suit, Taylor-ed for your company's needs.
Thanks for the direction and encouragement! I'm continually impressed by the supportive community around Swift. It's good to know I'm not missing some singular key concept; that's always my fear in self-taught. Back to the basics I go!
Great advice, thanks! Splitting into reusable pieces is definitely something I'll look into; esp the subviews.
People go to school for years to learn this. It's not the sort of skill that can easily be communicated in a Reddit comment. There's no one trick that solves this problem. (The other answers here are throwing acronyms at you or saying to just "split up your code" but that's not necessarily very helpful if you don't know *how* to split up your code.) If I had to give a short answer, it'd be: read books on abstraction building. The best is SICP. Many people will complain about this choice because it's 30 years old, it doesn't use Swift, and it's not an easy step-by-step tutorial on how to write an iOS to-do-list app that you can get through in a weekend. (I almost wrote "blog", because that was the standard "hello world" for so long, but I guess that was *last* decade.) Sorry. It does take you from "this is an integer", up through functions, creating an object system, program evaluation, register machine design, and finally compilation. Once you can get from "an integer" to "a compiler", any other type of abstraction you need on a given Thursday should be a piece of cake -- whether or not it has a cool acronym, and a webpage with a logo.
The table of contents looks really intriguing; I'll check it out. Thanks!
A bit like searching for info on the Samba file sharing software and having to go through dancing sites.
Google has a weird anti-profile for me. I only do Mac work, yet 75% of the results are for iOS. Yes, Google, because `NSTableView` is clearly the same as `UITableView`. Great fuzzy matching, real top-notch work.
Taylor Swift doesn't show up in a "swift programming" search in private browsing (on my end), either.
Eye friendly works well for me: http://eye-friendly.com/
I don’t know either, doesn’t matter the resolution, it just gives a black screen, the only fix to black screen that I found is to restart the computer. glad I didn’t let the daemon launch at log in. 
Creating separate views has already been said. I'll say two more things: - child view controllers - delegates in separate extensions or perhaps better, separate files
If it is not better, do you reccomned some other code that a beginner could understand? &amp;#x200B; \`\`\` if let data = "Hello".data(using: .utf8) { FileHandle.standardOutput.write(data) } \`\`\` &amp;#x200B; Is without Tidal.
Why are you storing the number as a String and then converting it back to number to compare it with another number?
Here you go: func pickerView(_ pickerView: UIPickerView, titleForRow row: Int, forComponent component: Int) -&gt; String? { guard let age = Int(Age.all[row].ageMonths) else { return nil } switch age { case 1: return "\(age) month old" case 2..&lt;36: return "\(age) months old" default: return "\(Int(floor(Double(age)/12))) years old" } } The problem with the Optional is because you're trying to convert a String to an Int, which can fail if the String isn't a valid Int. The other (real) issue you're having here, is that you're trying to divide an Int, which will result in a Double, but you're not converting it to a Double first. &amp;#x200B; I also changed it up to a switch, but you don't have to do that, I just did it because I like the way it reads better. Personal preference.
Depending on what you want to add you might want to check out using a toolbar above the keyboard (called an input accessory view). Here is the first tutorial I found from a quick google: [https://appendto.com/2018/10/how-to-add-a-toolbar-above-the-ios-keyboard-swift/](https://appendto.com/2018/10/how-to-add-a-toolbar-above-the-ios-keyboard-swift/)
&gt;Hey! At the moment im working on some code for a company I work with doing a quiz game and I was wondering if anyone knew the sort of command I need to use to make my array shuffle and then pick out questions at random with out repeating???? If anyone can help thank you You are correct. **next?.previous = prev** will do nothing if next is nil. Your **if let** is clearer and easier to read/understand for beginners, but does the same exact thing.
I’m just gonna make a scuffed version of one of those and call it Tyler
Wow I like that solution a lot. Thank you! 
Why not just write one yourself? It's extremely easy, you just have to pay attention to not make another refreshtoken call while one is in progress like that library you linked would do. (Making the internal funcions public/open is also not a great idea if you want others to easily understand your code)
Experience, my dude. Just write lots of code. Try to do things on your own, but don't be afraid of getting some guidance. Eventually you'll get comfortable doing things on your own. 
I'm in a similar position, and I used [this article](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/how-to-use-a-model-view-viewmodel-architecture-for-ios-46963c67be1b) to help refactor a small app I built into the Model, View, view-Model architecture that really helps break up the massive view controller.
You should be very careful about using older tutorials, especially one that covers something well covered by other tutorials that are more modern. Here's the thing, Swift has changed and you're learning from what could be the oldest version of Swift. There's tutorials on Udemy for about $10 that cover Core Data (and a TON more) in Swift 4. If this were a tutorial for something uncommon, it would be different, but because Core Data is covered by many tutorials, this 5 year old tutorial should be skipped.
Yeah and her nick name is T-Swizzle...
Thanks for making this! I found it very useful in my little raspberry pi project. I really enjoyed being able to use Swift to setup my link between iOS and the pi. You should cross-post to the rpi subreddits too. 
It looks like it was updated 1 year ago, has 122 stars and 60 forks. I'd check to see if anyone has updated it. Here's a tutorial from last year, IDK if it uses a more modern API or not. https://www.raywenderlich.com/243-oauth-2-0-with-swift-tutorial
Just reproducing tutorials won’t help you too much, unless you do a crazy amount of them. You need to understand the fundamentals of Swift/Cocoa, for a more productive outcome. At the very least, you should read the Swift book.
I'm glad it helped!

I like to search for "swiftlang" 
Search on stackoverflow, not on google. 
only two letters difference though
It’s because you always use Private Browsing
I consider still trying to work with it because I want this logging app that the video OP makes and I haven‘t yet found a newer tutorial for that, but I think I will try to work every day on a current course like you proposed, thank you
Look what you make me do

Excellent summary of what's coming up, thanks for posting!
Me and my friend launched our first app not long ago. It is called [Vriends](https://www.vriends.frl). Right now we are making the contact page, so we can get some feedback for the app. The app makes it easy to track your friendships, remind you of awesome stuff you will do together and gives you the option to add gift ideas. We are open for feedback from anyone about anything.
Wow Do you use the services of Russians? Greetings from Russia)
Yes that is what I said it is like this : let decoder = JSONEncoder() decoder.keyDecodingStrategy = .convertFromSnakeCase But if you have server that do response camelcase or snakecase you can make a custom CodingKey ...also within you custom CodingKey you can set you Date formatter and other things you need to parse multiple time. Check the project .. it is very small and easy to use.
Ah sorry missed that.
Sounds like the API probably has an access limit for a certain amount of time and you are rubbing up against it. 
No prob m8 😊
That image is something else.
My old MacBook can no longer install new major updates like Mojave :(

The method calls should be similar to the objective c calls. So here is the base info you will need to get started. import MoPub class SomeTableViewController: UITableViewController { private var adPlacer: MPTableViewAdPlacer! override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() setupAdPlacer() } // Handle your regular table view delegate methods below } extension SomeTableViewController: MPTableViewAdPlacerDelegate { private func setupAdPlacer() { let settings = MPStaticNativeAdRendererSettings() settings.renderingViewClass = NativeBanner.self settings.viewSizeHandler = { (maxWidth: CGFloat) -&gt; CGSize in return CGSize(width: maxWidth, height: 80) } guard let config = MPStaticNativeAdRenderer.rendererConfiguration(with: settings) else { print("Not Able to configure") return } adPlacer = MPTableViewAdPlacer(tableView: tableView, viewController: self, rendererConfigurations: \[config\]) adPlacer.delegate = self adPlacer.loadAds(forAdUnitID: "YOUR AD UNIT IT") } }
I think it's okay to ask here since it involves Swift itself. As another option of a place to ask, the Vapor Discord is perfect for questions like this! Here's the link: [Vapor Discord](https://discord.gg/vapor)
Not trying to be a dick but you should ask the IT department to unblock Gooogle if you get questions like that.
You'll find that function defined in the AppDelegate class, which is conforming to the UIApplicationDelegate protocol. Now, this is a protocol you are going to respond to, but never call because it is how the system makes calls to your app. This will get called when you press the home button or switch to another app (ie. when you leave your app the system asks if you want to do anything while its resigning.)
Small app that scales windows into tiles of different sizes based on customisable keyboard sequences. Noticed a substantial lack of features in both Keyboard Maestro and BetterTouchTool, so I've decided to create a tool of my own.
if you created a new project from the template in Xcode, like Single View App, it must contain AppDelegate.swift with some of this methods defined
Does your app show anything in the logs? You could be hitting the memory limit which would kill your app. But the logs should at least provide a clue
I am working on parsing and IR generation of my language [Swizzle](https://safelyswift.github.io/Swizzle/). Currently basic features are implemented so you can defined variables and functions. I have to take a look at precedence climbing in more detail. If anyone has any resources on that, I'd be happy for help :). I have also developed a syntax highlighting feature [here](https://github.com/SafelySwift/Swizzle/tree/swizzle-1.0/Source/Sneak%20Peek).
Should I learn swift?
An app for creating lists with user-customized fields, basically like AirTable but trying to improve on the things about AirTable that I really dislike. It's nothing ground-breaking but it's presented a lot of interesting challenges so far already (started last month), and I decided to use Realm just to make it an opportunity to learn something new.
I have the exact same issue lol i understand most tutorials n concepts but as soon as i have to do it by myself my mind goes blank
I just added search functionality to my Hacker News client, [Octal](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1308885491). It's currently free on the App Store, here. Please check it out and give feedback!

Yea it sucks but don’t give up just keep going💪
I am trying myself to write a reimplementation of ps3netsrv in swift. Basically a tcp/ip Server the ps3 Van communicate with. Also a native download manager for osx. Moving from firebase to mongodb because the app is targeted at enterprise use where control and flexibilty is needed
Magnet can do this.
Magnet has the very same limitations as BTT and Keyboard Maestro. The key thing here is the correct detection of key sequences (⌥⌘ Num9 Num9 Num9 or ⌥⌘ ← ← ← for example) and the support of more than just 8 or 10 possible position. &amp;#x200B; In theory, my app currently supports resizing and positioning windows to any desired position, but has a pre-defined set of around 20 implemented. [`https://imgur.com/a/WByKjCT`](https://imgur.com/a/WByKjCT) &amp;#x200B;
I’d really like to work on a unit test library/framework similar to [Spock](http://spockframework.org/spock/docs/1.3-RC1/spock_primer.html#specifications_as_documentation) but I don’t think I’ll have the time 😞. 
I had the same problem with my PowerMac G5 and the death of PowerPC.
I’m trying out server side swift with perfect. It’s for a school project because i wanted to try something different from NodeJS. Kinda afraid it won’t be enough also kinda curious about sss. 
Yeah sure why not?
 Created an ‘agent’ class in my code because I’m trying to create a primordial particle system. I’m just learning and dont know how to get it to animate. How can i make the agents SKNodes if they’re already part of a class. I am just writing this on my iPad so i dont have Xcode (as I’m not intending to make this a full app), is there a way i can get it to run in a playground or something? help!
What made you choose Perfect over Vapor or Kitura?
As it works on one computer but not another, I would say it's likely to not involve Swift at all. Is there a log file which suggests the problem is occurring in Swift code?
First of all, it’s just a REST API, so without HTML or anything. Second I need to use MongoDB and perfect has native support for that. So I just tried out thei APIh example and put the code in main -&gt; routers -&gt; controllers. So far so good. However, the missing of next() and only the possibility to return strings is kind of weird for me. Have to check the MongoDB connector yet. Kitura’s example was so full I could not orient directly. And vapor does not use response or next in their routing. Coming for NodeJS I still have some doubts by all the frameworks. But I might try them all. 
Looks promising. I’m a long time Magnet user, and was pretty satisfied with it ...until I bought an ultra wide monitor. There’s just too few predefined positions and one can’t define own ones. 
I use Spectacle (like it) and since it’s open source it may be useful to you
Learning swift and xcode
Nearly exactly my thoughts. If you're interested, I can send you over a development build with some specific configurations for you, would be interesting how the wide-screen stuff works out since I don't use one by myself. Just message me, I'd be happy about it, since this is my very first application which is supposed to be used by other people than me! PS.: You can currently reassign keyboard shortcuts by yourself, the behaviour of the text fields used to record user input is sometimes a bit weird, however. Working on it.
I am tired of impedance mismatch with low level Code Media, Core Audio, Core Video frameworks. Working on a library consisting extensions to make life easier. So instead of `CMSampleBufferGetPresentationTimeStamp(buffer)`, just use `buffer.presentationTimestamp`. 
Getting sidetracked even more than usual and writing a lzss library to decompress the iOS kernel
Unfortunately, even Spectacle has the same limitations as Magnet, BTT and Maestro have.
This past month I've been working on an aI for the game 2048 in swift and it has been one of the most fun projects I've ever worked on. The current version can consistently hit the 16384 tile.
What I meant is that Vapor uses Swift as its language to power its framework as a backend. This is similar to asking an iOS specific question. Typically those questions fit more into r/iOSProgramming, but they're answered here nonetheless. It's possible the Get route could be incorrect too, in which that would directly involve Swift code.
I mean, do you want to learn Swift? If so, then yes you should learn Swift. Otherwise, is it part of your job or a job you might have in the future? If so, then yes you should learn Swift. If both answers are "no", I think you have your answer as to whether or not you should learn Swift.
I'm not sure if I want to learn swift or not. Not part of my job
I'm working on a Swift binding for the Plaid API. [https://github.com/psittaciformes/plaid-swift](https://github.com/psittaciformes/plaid-swift) Made some good headway on the project then got super sick so been recovering the past few days.
Currently bitching about having to unwrap optional in an array that became a [String?] array just to get String values out of it and watching Xcode’s suggested fixes failing, compactMap and flatMap failing. And this is better than Objective-C how? What a royal PITA just to get values out of an array.
Lord have mercy on your spul.
Try Mosaic by Light Pillar
You could have avoided this error if you’d used an enum.
Age old question of class vs struck. I tend to only use classes, especially for complex structures consisting of multiple values and sub-objects. Usually quick and dirty “serialize for a web request” stuff. Am I doing this wrong? Or is this not worth caring about.

Can someone tell me why? Is it because there are two javascript cycles? Is there a parameter for Javascript string that will allow me to see the fully rendered HTML?

First “real” app I’m working on and it’s a grocery list using firebase, pretty simple but I think it’s a good first app to learn 
That sounds like a tedious project at first but the outcome must make it all worth it
Honestly the programming isn’t even that tedious. There’s a lot of interesting things to try to implement along the way (the main strategy is expectimax, but there’s a lot of additions to make such as caching and improved heuristics)
That’s awesome, are you learning as you go along or do you have a plan?
In trying to code and run a Primordial particle system on my iPad. I dont have Xcode though and i dont know how to get the agents to animate
I learned about expectimax from an AI class I took last year. Other than that, it’s more just every time I think of something that might improve it, I implement it. Another thing is that I’m not one to usually organize my code very well for personal projects because nobody else ever sees them, but for this one I decided I wanted to try to design this with good coding principles and modularity in mind, and it has been going really well. It’s super customizable and easy to run tests on. It’s one of my first big projects with swift and I absolutely adore the language so far. Also I’m using it as an excuse to gain experience with google cloud by running a shitload of tests there. (Thank god swift can run in Linux). It’s on github so if you’re curious I can PM you the link. 
Learning swift. I took an online course and completed a few simple ios apps. Now I'm taking a deeper dive in swift before getting back to ios. 
My dad maintains a dictionary of the people who’ve been important, historically, in the region that he lives in. He’s been on it for 15 years now, and I think that he has about 12,000 entries. He’s been doing it on an iBook with GoLive for a very long time, because it’s been discontinued and it doesn’t run on his more recent Air. There are a lot of things that are not ideal about this setup. Aside from the extremely outdated software and extremely outdated OS and how easy it probably is to make errors, according to him, he recently hit the maximum number of hyperlinks that GoLive allows in your entire project. This is also problematic because there doesn’t seem to be any modern HTML WYSIWYG editor that is fundamentally just a text editor; they’re all optimized to produce Bootstrap websites or something. So, I’m working on an app that would hopefully help him with that: * standard format for entries * saved to text files as YAML, with a git repo behind for history * runs on recent hardware and software (obviously) * exports to HTML (of course), with pagination and more hyperlinks than he could ever do with his bare hands (and that GoLive would handle, apparently)
If it's safe to unwrap, it's only a single character. Shebang. I found it sometimes annoying but overall very ergonomic. But maybe I misunderstand your issue. 
Module Stability
Post your code so people can help you better
There are many ways to couple them, all involving substantial amount of code. In any case use GKSKNodeComponent, but then you have some choice with using entities and/or component systems. It is not a trivial choice, you really need to think it through, depending on your requirements.
Nope, because the rawValue initializer of the enum would just return nil and with the optional chaining it wouldn’t throw. If it was !.description, it would throw
I had a very similar issue with the Perfect server-side framework. Worked completely fine on my local machine, but then threw a 502 error when deployed to GCP App Engine. I finally realized that I wasn’t allocating enough memory on my cloud instance. Try allocating more memory on your cloud machine and see if it helps. 
Working on pubg😄
I’m working on a sudoku solver that uses the processes that are actually used to solve sudoku puzzles rather than the usual brute force approach for computerised sudoku solvers. I’m finding it to be a very good exercise in learning how to express concepts in code. Ultimately, when it’s reliably solving puzzles, I’d love to extend it with some kind of AR/OCR to solve puzzles in a magazine or newspaper
That's neat. I'm on the same boat, playing with my own small swift projects and I love the language (although I still have a lot more to learn). Also, I completely get what you mean when you say that it feels good to start the project with good coding principles haha... it feels official! And sure, I'd love to check it out!
If anyone looking for freelancer let me know.
Sales
Sales? Need for clarification David
You’re going to need to know how to sell your services. That involves finding potential prospects, spending time on the right leads, negotiating terms, getting paid, and making sure your clients are happy. Technical knowledge is important, but without sales skills, you won’t be able to win work. I’ve been a software engineer for 10+ years, but I consider my sales skills just as (if not more) important to my freelance career.
I’m adding a really cool new feature to HiLo, where users can choose to join us as a beta tester, and thus sign up to receive some surveys and help us shape the future of the app. We’re also planning the next steps in the big redesign, and I’m making big steps in moving away from Firebase as much as possible. Interesting stuff!
I am trying to send a few dictionaries of booleans and integers from my iOS app to some server for analytics. Please do not suggest using Firebase or the like, I am trying to do it on my own. I am looking for an ELI5 explanation as I am a beginner to servers and databases, and Swift is the only language I know. I understand that it can be done using Vapor, AWS, a REST API and MySQL. Looking for an ELI5 (Explain like I'm 5 years old) explanation about what happens and where. What is Vapor's role here? What part of the work will be done by AWS? Will AWS simply host the Swift code file containing the REST API? Will the code simply accept the POST requests and save the data to an AWS database? Will AWS host the MySQL database? Will the code run on an AWS virtual instance of Linux? Does the instance need to run all the time to be able to collect data as users use my app round the clock? How can I see consolidated query results on the data? Will Paul's book on Vapor be helpful for this scenario? P.S. Please try to be gentle with the terminology, as I am brimming with more than a hundred newly-learnt terms which are explained with further new terms.
Firstly, I’m software engineer having 5+ years of experience. I’m communicating with end client for product domain area &amp; market trend expect coding of any language. I always provide solutions oriented approach to client so he/she can sale products &amp; I’m also added feedback for sales. I have skill of ios, android, react native &amp; php technology. I am able to clear any requirements easily &amp; finialize the flow of product.

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array/2994747-randomelement https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/string Since Swift 4.2 you can use randomElement() and simply + your Strings.

I'm pretty sure you're approaching the problem in the wrong (non-Swifty) way. Give us a code example and we'll help. 
Charts are cool. What kind of charts?
Keep it up!
Could be the thing, because yesterday I tried switching to Heroku and deploying my app there - it's running flawlessly since then. Let's hope it stays that way! Thanks!
Thanks man!!
That should work fine for my needs. I'll give it a try, thanks.
Can you show me a sample of this would work in Swift? let array = ["Depressed", "Advanced", "Anemic"] print(array.randomElement()!) This is what I added so far, but I'm not sure if I'm going in the right direction. 
What challenge is this?
yes I mean put it in a playground and run it :D then you can do whatever with the String: print(array.randomElement()! + "_" + "ElonMusk619")

100 days of swift by Paul Hudson
God bless you for sharing this! I am so fucking in!!
How do I sign up?
Sorry, I'm still new to all this so somethings are a bit confusing. So far what I have is working at the very basic level. I've tried to find tutorials on Youtube about this, but have come up short. let array = ["Depressed", "Advanced", "Anemic"]; print(array.randomElement()!) print(array.randomElement()! + "_" + "ElonMusk619") This has yielded me Depressed_ElonMusk619, Advanced_ElonMusk619, and Anemic_ElonMusk619. Is it possible to combine two arrays, something like: let array1 = ["Depressed", "Advanced", "Anemic"] let array2 = ["ElonMusk619", "ManletXXX", "BilboBaggins"] And then code something along the line that prints a random combination of the words from array1 and array2....

call forEach on array2 :)

Glad to hear. I haven’t used Heroku but it probably has tools that you can use to check memory usage of your running app. If you’re using a Docker container you can also check the resource usage statistics of your running container with the ‘docker stats’ command in the terminal. 
Paul Hudson, author of the Hacking with Swift book series just started a 100 Days of Swift tutorial. It’s on day 2 currently but no better time to start than today!
let array1 = ["Depressed", "Advanced", "Anemic"]; (array1.randomElement()!) let array2 = ["ElonMusk619", "ManletXXX", "BilboBaggins"]; (array2.randomElement()!) print(array1.randomElement()!, array2.randomElement()!, " " , " ") This seems to work without "call forEach" which I don't understand yet.. I suppose I've made some progress. I appreciate you explaining things in a way where I'm actually learning instead of you doing it all for me! 
Yep, there are metrics in the dashboard which display memory usage among other things. From looking at it, my app uses from 30 up to 50 mb of memory. Vapor cloud provides only 32mb on entry tiers so that was definitely the issue (Heroku has 512mb)!
https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ControlFlow.html I guess you want all usernames with a random prefix. For this you have to go through all the names and generate a random prefix for them then stitch them together. Check out the link, how to iterate though an array and stuff. :)
Building a library for modular table views that handle all the usual needs of most apps. Loading in entire, reloading cells as data updates, pushing when scrolling. AND I'll be line streaming the whole thing :) 
Nice. Yeah, I struggled with my app for a couple of days before finally narrowing it down to the same issue. Good to know that Heroku has a higher allocation. 
appWillResignActive is located in AppDelegate.swift and it will be called when user tap the home button (or swipe up from bottom in iPhone X series), here's a demo I did on how to put code in it : [https://files.catbox.moe/pri1vr.mp4](https://files.catbox.moe/pri1vr.mp4) , Hope this helps!
This is actually a perfect case for the `zip` function, you can use it like this ``` let array1 = ["Depressed", "Advanced", "Anemic"] let array2 = ["ElonMusk619", "ManletXXX", "BilboBaggins"] let joinedNames = zip(array1, array2).map({ $0 + "_" + $1 }) ``` It will join the two arrays taking one of each (like a zip hence the name), you can then map the result however you like in the example above joining the elements with a "_" between 
Yes, language being in constant flux is probably an important reason. Also, lack of true cross-platform support is a main reason I think. More often than not, CLI tools are expected to be available for Windows, Mac and Linux. Also, distribution is an issue, since executable are statically linked to a swift runtime. [That makes in my opinion Go probably a more attractive alternative](https://medium.com/@gerwert/notes-on-building-and-distributing-a-small-cross-platform-cli-tool-3eddc07b8449) for CLI tools.
Congratulations! I haven’t been getting perfect scores on all the quizzes, but I’m excited and learning from my mistakes along the way!
Last month was really busy for me, and I think February is going to be even busier. In January, I: - Published 31 videos in a new series called Xcode in 20 Seconds. I’ll be publishing 9 more in February – [you can find the whole playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvVkR5z65XU&amp;t=0s&amp;index=2&amp;list=PLuoeXyslFTuYQ9Hoh42Bw8sPYMlTOV0V7) - Released 66 Xcode playgrounds covering all Swift changes from 1.0 through to 5.0. These are all available on [WhatsNewInSwift.com](https://www.whatsnewinswift.com) - Wrote [12 articles](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles) about a variety of topics. - Recorded seven “What's new in Swift?” videos – again, [you can find the whole playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6tuUzmxyOU&amp;list=PLuoeXyslFTuar0FSCJJ-kJ5p9_RDVNMhV&amp;index=2&amp;t=1s) - Published a new [Swift Playgrounds book for iPad](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/playgrounds) - Released a [20-minute video on coordinators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HgbcTqxoN4) - Did six hours of live streams through my [Swift on Sundays series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkcNxzulGhk&amp;t=185s), and more. And in February? Well: - I just announced my [100 Days of Swift curriculum](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), which collects resources from around my site into a single coherent curriculum that everyone can follow to learn Swift – for free. - Yesterday I published the first in a new series of videos called [Inside the Standard Library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlxQPfFEP90). Each video will take one common method from the standard library, such as map or flatMap, then recreate it from scratch in a playground. We’ll then look at how the Swift standard library implements the same code, and talk about any special optimizations or techniques they apply. - More Swift on Sundays livestreams – there’s one this weekend at 10am GMT. Each time we’ll build an app from scratch or dive into a technique, but either way will be doing live coding. Plus of course a lot more articles about Swift, and more – not least speaking at MobOS in [Cluj Napoca](http://romobos.com). In fact, I’d better get off Reddit so I can get back to work 😅
Welcome! I hope you enjoy the course 👍
Great! And keep in mind this is only my first time running this scheme – it's possible some of the tests need some edits to make them better, so don't be afraid to tweet me @twostraws if you hit a problem.
Thank you for this! Awaiting for the second video.
That is not random though. Like OP wasked for. I suggest checking out dov69 link further down.
awesome! thanks for sharing
You’re right I didn’t read through OPs comment correctly. However the example might useful if he did want to do that. You do have to force unwrap randomElement as it returns an optional Element as your array could be empty. It would be nice if the compiler could figure this out when you have an immutable array with at least 1 element, but the difference is literally just adding a !
Oh ok. Sorry, then I was wrong. Swift has changed so much. Its hard keeping up. Logically I feel I should be right. TIL :) Thank you! Will edit my response.
Well this will be a different story after Swift 5 launches. At that point ABI stability will reduce the need to statically link or enclose with the program a dynamically loaded lib specific to that compiler. You do not have to statically link Swift, it is just the only rational way to go for now. This is often why I tell people that Swift is still in beta. Without the clean distribution that a frozen ABI offers it just isn’t ready for prime time. However that does not dismiss Swift’s positive features which I see driving adoption moving forward. 
I can't wait till you get to advanced closure semantics! It is going to be so much fun trolling those beginner with `weak` puns!
Trying to learn UIKit as a Vapor dev. I have never really done much UI coding, besides HTML and CSS, and this is a completely different paradigm I'm not familiar with. Wish me luck! (It also doesn't help most resources on UIKit assumes no prior knowledge of Swift, so it gets boring to reiterate on stuff I already know)
What would you use Swift for, and have you wondered if you should learn Swift or not for a long time? Maybe a more important question is, _why_ do you want to learn Swift, and what's there to be indecisive about?
? I'm confused. Did you already go through all of day 1's material? There were quite a few videos there. And day 2 has already been released, with more video links.
Can’t recommend u/twostraws hacking with swift course more. I started my iOS development career with his stuff, and I currently work as a full time iOS/Android dev. Definitely worth the time going through the massive amount of material he’s put together over the years, and continues to put together. 
What is your continuous level indicator? Could you make a pastern of your code? It is difficult to understand what to do if you are vague on the problem.
Maybe contribute to Swift! It is very easy to do so: just make a PR or propose! I have actually edited `Foundation` (pretty cool).
Fun idea. Where do I even start though? I don’t have ideas. I just want to code lol
Source code is right here: https://github.com/ASKProducts/2048AI If you want to play it, just clone or download the repo and then run "swift run" and it should start playing in the command line. The current settings should have it consistently getting to 4096 and sometimes hitting 8192 or above. Most of the code is not documented, so if you want to play around with it feel free to let me know and I can give you a quick rundown of how it works and what to modify.
I assume you have some variable where you save your level, if so you could use property observers (see [here](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Properties.html)) &amp;#x200B; var level: Int = 0 { willSet(newLevel) { // happens before the value is actually set, the name in the parenthesis ("newLevel" here) can be used to do something with the new value } didSet { // happens after the value was set, here you can use the name of the variable (e.g. "level") for the new value and "oldValue" for the old value, e.g. for comparisons etc if level &gt; oldValue { // do something } } } Which one you need really depends on what exactly you want to do, if you need to do some checks before or not etc. In both cases you'd simply set the ".text" property of whatever you use to the new level, e.g. levelLabel.text = "Level: \(newLevel)" //using 'newLevel' here for willSet, you'd need to use just 'level' if you use didSet &amp;#x200B;
You can start here: https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-9823?jql=status%20in%20(Open%2C%20Reopened%2C%20%22To%20Do%22)%20AND%20component%20in%20(Foundation%2C%20%22High%20level%20APIs%22%2C%20%22Package%20Manager%22%2C%20SourceKit-LSP%2C%20%22Standard%20Library%22%2C%20XCTest)%20AND%20assignee%20in%20(EMPTY)%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC%2C%20votes%20DESC These are JIRA tickets for bugs, enhancements, etc for things like Foundation, Standard Library, etc. These are (mostly) written in Swift, so feel free to pick one up.
The question boils down to this. Classes are reference objects and Structs are value objects. Meaning when you pass around a Class you are giving everyone who knows about the Class the ability to change it's data. When you pass around a Struct you are giving everyone an exact copy of the Struct at the moment you hand it off. Here is a little playground showing how this works: import Foundation import PlaygroundSupport PlaygroundPage.current.needsIndefiniteExecution = true struct MyStruct { var value: Int = 0 } class MyClass { var value: Int = 0 init(value: Int) { self.value = value } } func delayedPrint(_ myStruct: MyStruct) { DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background).async { print("&lt;delayed&gt;: struct value: \(myStruct.value)") } } func delayedPrint(_ myClass: MyClass) { DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background).async { print("&lt;delayed&gt; class value: \(myClass.value)") } } var myStruct = MyStruct(value: 10) let myClass = MyClass(value: 10) print("struct value: \(myStruct.value)") print("class value: \(myClass.value)") delayedPrint(myStruct) delayedPrint(myClass) myClass.value = 100 myStruct.value = 100 print("struct value: \(myStruct.value)") print("class value: \(myClass.value)") After running this you will be able to see that in the delayed printing of myStruct the value isn't changed, but for myClass the value printed was changed. Now weather you are doing this wrong or not all depends on if your data could be changed by some other thread or process out from under you. In a lot of cases this all boils down to personal preference. I personally like to use Structs when I don't ever want my data to change (especially since I'd have to define the Struct as a var if I did want to change internal values giving me a clear indication that the data is changeable), and Classes when I need that data to be synced across any and all places where I'm using the Class.
It's possible, not Possible. Don't randomly capitalize words. 
It looks like your code is just doing everything at once. You're not animating it over a period of time. The code is running instantly.
How do I get to run 1 cycle then animate when I put present scene in the loop it runs twice then says error
I integrated Push Notifications for my chat app. Turns out it was a little harder than I thought, so I've just published the code to help developers add Push Notifications with Firebase to their app easily, so they don't need to go through the issues I've encountered. Here's the source code of [starter kit](https://www.iosapptemplates.com/templates/firebase-push-notifications-swift-starter-kit). I've also documented all the steps on [how to configure the APNs &amp; Firebase](https://www.iosapptemplates.com/blog/ios-development/push-notifications-firebase-swift-5).
Idea of this project is adorable.
May I recommend creating a sub for folks to post progress and talk about the course? High five to u/twostraws for sharing this.
I love your job 💪🏻
This smells like an interview coding challenge. I'm not going to do your interview for you, but I will tell you your algorithm is wrong. [0, 2, 4] is not a win condition however your algorithm will report it as such.
Yeah I posted this thinking the video on top was day 1 / intro. If you scroll down on that page you’ll see Day 1 and 2. I only went through Day 1 - the videos are only 1 min long. 
I guess you could try some timers: [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nstimer?language=occ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nstimer?language=occ)
Thank you I was just playing around and you are right. Very good review. 🤗
For such a simple matrix, I would simply hardcode the win conditions. It's easier to read and maintain. let win = [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [2, 4, 6], [0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [0, 4, 8]].contains(mySequence); &amp;#x200B;
I fixed it but this only good for a tictactoe game but to do a large matrix it is not a good option. I noticed that in the previous version \[1,2,3\] was also valid so I added a keypad that the result has to conform to. I have other solutions for TicTacToe of course but I want to challenge myself to make a shorter one. Just me being bored late in the evening and wife and son already a sleep. ;-)
A couple of weeks ago I asked Mark, on Facebook, in a very polite message what is going on with Devslopes. He blocked me, not wanting to answer. Now he is calling **people who are upset, people who didn't do anything**. Go figure. From what I understand he might be easily bored with any new thing he's on. So if ever he makes a crowdfunding or request money upfront for some hypothetical product / book / course, I wouldn't go forward. Trust is lost. &amp;#x200B;
I don't believe there's an easy way to do it. I had to do something similar for school, you can find it [here](https://github.com/augusto2112/PSE/) Please take a look at the ImageRep class. It has an initializer which takes a UIImage, then you can subscript directly on the ImageRep object (or use the getArray() method to get all pixels) and average out the values you want. Also note this was a school project, and I wasn't particularly interested in perfomance, and it can be quite slow. 
Keep in mind that “typing more code” does not usually mean worse code. You’ll spend much more time look through code than writing it, so spending a few extra lines can save quite some time to understand it again later. In this case, checking for each direction separately would probably be clearer to understand / less annoying to verify (as the bugs show). If your intention is to make it as short as possible for fun, you might want to check out code golf. eg this exact problem is being discussed here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2245801/code-golf-tic-tac-toe.
Yes it is just to challenge myself to keep it short...all fun and games ... If I had to review it in a normal codebase I would go crazy hahaha So I agree that code needs to be clear but in this case I just challenge myself to keep at short as possible. I will check out the stackoverflow link thanks
I’ve done this too, surprisingly there’s no easy way to do it. I remember something like accessing an “unsafe” bit stream member and then using “unsafe” pointers to access different pixels. I just did a center weighted average and didn’t sample that many pixels. It worked well for my uses. An actual average would be a lot of work.
This is... Pretty unintelligible. Why is it all in one line? What's with the variable names?
Your joking right....why the hate wtf... I said it is just a challenge for myself what is your problem. 
Don’t know off the top of my head but I think you may have to convert the UIImage to a CVPixelBuffer or something.
macOS has an NSImageReg, but iOS does not have a UIImageRep. You can render the UIImage's CGImage into an appropriate CGBitmapContext, then look at the CGContext's backing array of pixels. Apple provides a CIFilter that will give you the answer more directly: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/media/how-to-read-the-average-color-of-a-uiimage-using-ciareaaverage
Google Firebase is your answer. The easiest to learn. Very powerful. Scales from $0 to infinity based on your usage and you get a lot of usage for $0. 
sounds beautiful, thank you :)
Will do buddy!
Thanks for the effort. I'll review.
Thank you :)
Why bother with a third party service? Apple provides to you for free with CloudKit. Its pretty amazing.
To the best of my knowledge, this is the correct way to do it. UIImages aren’t necessarily bitmap pictures or RGB, so the only way to get a buffer of RGB pixels for them is to draw them to a surface first. 
That wasn't at all hate! Although it certainly does read that way, because I didn't communicate clearly. Cryptic, maximally shorted, 1 liner code is perfectly fine (and fun!) for little programming challenges, code golf, etc. But if you're going to present some code as a reusable piece for others to consume ("hey guys, look what I wrote, you should try it out in your own projects!") then you have a much higher bar to clear, in terms of clear variable naming, followable implementation logic, documentation and flexibility to modifications. Your code falls into the first category (and that's okay!) but doesn't clear the bar for the latter. But you need to work on it more if you expect others to be able to use it. Experimentation is great, and I'm certainly not shitting on it! This is merely a call to improvement.
looks sweet! i’ll check it out and give some feedback!
Higher bar to clear? Dude seriously get a life !!! Use it if you want to use and if not then don't.I am not forcing to do anything to anybody. If there are standards on this forum to post stuff like this please show me and block my free mind and free speech to share just some brainwave which turned in to a challenge for myself. If somebody wants to use it in his project and change the variable names or what ever please do so.... Who are you to tell me how to do anything. The freedom of a forum is to post what ever and to use what ever.... and if not then don't.. The only bar to clear here is YOUR bar and nobody else...and I do not care about you bar!!. You remind me of a guy that somebody else worked with and told me he did not want to work with him anymore because his code did not conform to this guys standard when he made a simple prototype and he always had something to say. The guy had a good idea and made a prototype which worked ....but nooooo this other guy was complaining the code did not had unittests and he used just MVC instead of VIPER ...variable names were not correct and there were grammer erros .... It was a bloody prototype so who bloody cares ... If it is a prototype eventually you take the time and make a complete solution of it. Your not going to put the guy down for have a good idea or wanted to show something to us just because he had an idea. Luckily this guy was released pretty fast afterwards because it blocks people to share stuff and try to do new things, because there is always some guy who wants to be a codebully. The best ideas come from notes and little trial and error things....you sound like a brainblocker because you have to be aware that your idea ...even when it compiles have to conform you standars. I will never do this to anybody and try to see there point of view on things instead of forcing my own ideas how things should be up on them. You can stick you implementation logic , documentation and flexibility to modifications somewhere the sun does not shine. And you will never stop me to have an idea ...share it ....fail or succeed ...try again , better it...because I do not conform your posting standards! &amp;#x200B; Seriously .... get a life instead of being a protocol I will never want to implement. protocol DoNotShareIdeasAndBeHappyToPerhapsGiveSomebodyElseAnIdeaHeCouldUse &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Thanks!
Wow. You seriously need to relax a bit. [XAleXOwnZX](https://www.reddit.com/user/XAleXOwnZX) was even apologizing for sounding rude and you just write this monologue here complaining. &amp;#x200B; And your title clearly states \`Shortest Tic Tac Toe check you can use to make your own game\`, so [XAleXOwnZX](https://www.reddit.com/user/XAleXOwnZX) was not completely wrong here.
Didn’t read everything, but your `importSafe(_ url: URL) throws -&gt; Value` method seems a little dangerous to me: If the function is called on the main thread and the network connectivity is bad, the program will freeze! So unless your library is meant to be called in non-asynchronous or non-event-based programs (no GUI, etc.), you really should make it load the URL asynchronously and then do the import of the content of the URL.
Such as?
Short answer: yes. But if you’re not going to be more specific, I won’t be able to give you much more info…
I believe they are both Turing-complete languages, so yes is the short answer.
&gt; If there are standards on this forum to post stuff like this please show me You didn't break any rules. Your standards should depend on a random subreddit. You should be self-driven to raising your standards. &gt; If somebody wants to use it in his project and change the variable names or what ever please do so.... That's *if* they can understand it. I have years of experience with Swift, and I have quite literally no idea how this code works. Sure you can call me stupid or whatever, but you need to consider that the utmost priority in software design (outside of code-golf/challenges, etc.) is writing maintainable, approachable software. Your fellow developers won't understand this, and even *you* won't understand this, in a few months once you've forgotten about it. You'll stumble back on this code and think "woah, how did I make this work?!". It's happened to all of us, and the funny part about such a situation is just how "obvious" some code seems, until you look at it with fresh eyes a year later. &gt; If it is a prototype eventually you take the time and make a complete solution of it. ***Exactly!*** That's what I'm encouraging you to do. You have a working prototype, but now that you hope to share it for others to use, you should spend the time to refine it! &gt; get a life A mature way to handle very straightforward, constructive criticism. Well handled. /s 
There are few things you can do: 1. Leverage a managed cloud service like Firebase. They offer iOS SDKs and AndroidSDKs to connect to the database you create in your Firebase console. This is OK but there’s a few issues: - your code is tightly tied to everything google - hard to divert from non Firebase code down the line say you built your own API once you realize Firebase a limitations. - I am not sold on the fact that it’s easier to build apps with then developing your own apis. 2. Develop your own API using Ruby on Rails or Node.js - You will need a database to store data so id suggest PostgreSQL or MySQL for relational style persistence. - read a book on express.js, JavaScript, node and u can figure it out I’d go with #2. :) 
Agreed. They're always improving it and won't remove the great free tier probably. 
woah, this is hella helpful, thank you :) do you have any recommendations for good books or programs for the API? 
Totally: Read these books... - The beginners guide to Node.js - The node craftsman - Eloquent JavaScript - and take the free online course for introduction to relational databases from Harvard edx - Edureka for AWS Architect class beginner level 💪
NumberFormatter can help, but the documentation is a bit complex. let f = NumberFormatter() f.string(from: 1234.5678) // 1235 f.numberStyle = .decimal f.string(from: 1234.5678) // 1,234.568 f.maximumFractionDigits = 2 f.string(from: 1234.5678) // 1,234.56 f.string(from: 1234) // 1,234 f.minimumFractionDigits = 2 f.string(from: 1234) // 1,234.00
I’m learning web development. I’m pretty good with html Css JavaScript but I need to learn some Server side stuff. Php seems like what I need to learn right now but I would rather start learning Swift. Php forms are what I’m starting with. Already I have a form on every page and I know php can generate duplicate code on multiple pages. 
From the last minute of the video - changing a constraint in the layout cycle method isn’t a great idea. Consider using height equality constraint with a multiplier. 
will definately have a look at it. 
If anyone wants an in-depth guide: If you check out moPub's repository on github, they have a sample app written in swift that covers their entire library. I recommend checking it out. if you need anymore help feel free to pm me and ill help out
Have a look at Raywenderlich s intro to vapor. One fine day I will the time to use it. 
Yes, but unless you have a mac, if you want autocompletion and other cool stuff with swift on linux you’ll have to wait a bit more or search for swift-lsp to get it working in vscode. As of PHP, since you know javascript you’d be better off learning node.js or more robust and safe technologies like scala. PHP forms are only ever used in legacy projects and every communication is done via AJAX and javascript nowadays especially if you plan on using any frontend framework or library (like angular, react, vue etc.)
In one of my apps I use these helper methods to fast-access any pixel. (**modify** the code for your needs) class ImageFastPixelColorHelper { let pixelData: CFData let data: UnsafePointer&lt;UInt8&gt; let pixelsGettingWidth: CGFloat let pixelSizeWidth: CGFloat let pixelSizeWidthHalf: CGFloat let pixelsGettingHeight: CGFloat let pixelSizeHeight: CGFloat let pixelSizeHeightHalf: CGFloat init(image: UIImage, verticalLines: Int, horizontalLines: Int) { pixelData = image.cgImage!.dataProvider!.data! data = CFDataGetBytePtr(pixelData) pixelsGettingWidth = image.size.width * image.scale pixelSizeWidth = pixelsGettingWidth / CGFloat(verticalLines) pixelSizeWidthHalf = pixelSizeWidth / 2 pixelsGettingHeight = image.size.height * image.scale pixelSizeHeight = pixelsGettingHeight / CGFloat(horizontalLines) pixelSizeHeightHalf = pixelSizeHeight / 2 } private func getPixelPosition(v: Int, h: Int) -&gt; CGPoint { return CGPoint( x: (CGFloat(v) * pixelSizeWidth) + pixelSizeWidthHalf, y: (CGFloat(h) * pixelSizeHeight) + pixelSizeHeightHalf) } func getPixelColor(v: Int, h: Int) -&gt; UIColor { return ImageFastPixelColorHelper.getPixelColor( data: data, width: pixelsGettingWidth, pos: getPixelPosition(v: v, h: h)) } // http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28532975/uiimage-loop-through-pixel-highly-inefficient // NOTE: INPUT IMAGE WIDTH MUST BE MULTIPLE OF 4 !!! // NOTE: INPUT IMAGE WIDTH MUST BE MULTIPLE OF 4 !!! // NOTE: INPUT IMAGE WIDTH MUST BE MULTIPLE OF 4 !!! private static func getPixelColor(data: UnsafePointer&lt;UInt8&gt;, width: CGFloat, pos: CGPoint) -&gt; UIColor { let pixelInfo: Int = ((Int(width) * Int(pos.y)) + Int(pos.x)) * 4 let r = CGFloat(data[pixelInfo]) / CGFloat(255.0) let g = CGFloat(data[pixelInfo + 1]) / CGFloat(255.0) let b = CGFloat(data[pixelInfo + 2]) / CGFloat(255.0) let a = CGFloat(data[pixelInfo + 3]) / CGFloat(255.0) return UIColor(red: r, green: g, blue: b, alpha: a) } } And usage let fastAccessor = ImageFastPixelColorHelper( image: yourImage, verticalLines: verticalLines, // These are my-app-specifc inputs horizontalLines: horizontalLines) // These are my-app-specifc inputs . . . let photoPixelColor = fastAccessor.getPixelColor(v: v, h: h) . . . &amp;#x200B;
Thank you, make it async is make sense.
No, you're not doing it wrong in my opinion. I also use structs for stuff I get back from an API, or other shallow stuff. I've tried using it for very complex data structures, but I found that I'd have to mark a lot of functions as "mutating", or adopt a more functional way of programming. Not a problem per say, but it's not the most common way of Swift development.
You're pretty much spot on. Vapor is meant for implementing the REST API. Meaning, it'll accept JSON, decode it, and save it into the MySQL database. And indeed, both will be running on Linux. That could be hosted on Amazon, or other cheaper VPS providers (VPS meaning Virtual Private Server). The instance does indeed need to run 24/7. To see consolidated query results, you'll need to either code yourself a dashboard-like screen in Vapor, or simply run some SQL commands straight on the MySQL database. Either with the MySQL client (commandline, on Linux) or with a graphical MySQL client. I don't have experience with Vapor. Paul's book will undoubtedly be of decent quality in helping with the effort.
you can do webdevelopment with Vapor. Its relatively easy to use too. I am a newbie in programming as a whole and vapor has caught my attention. I wish there were various video tutorials about vapor 3 with a medium size project.
I'd like to have a tableViewCell containing a button on the right side of the cell (such that I can have several copies of this cell). I can get the button on the cell but when the button is pressed I need to get the indexPath of the cell it is contained in. How do I go about doing this if the button is created programmatically? 
Hope you like it
well well well, you could add a table or board entity and separate the game logic. next, you could move the business logic out of the viewcontroller and only keep stuff that updates the view and handles user input.
Yes that is better, but I thought I show it like this so beginners have full view of the code. I will add a separate one in github later on, with separation of the logic, because a ViewContoller has te remain as clean a possible. Thanks for the input!
It's okay to doodle in a viewcontroller, but for many it's better to pick up good habits at the beginning. Although it's also good to practice refactoring. So, yeah, whatever. :)
Here's what I did. I tried to separate logics as much as possible. [https://github.com/boradori/tictactoe](https://github.com/boradori/tictactoe)
hahaha yes ;-) I added commentary in the Github that I will make a cleaner version of it otherwise I am the catalyst of massive ViewContollers hahaha
Looks great!! But I did this one to keep it as small as possible and some people wanted to see it work. So I tried to use a minimum of code. I like your tictactoe eiher way. Good job !
My opinion: CocoaPod must be dropped in favor of Carthage everywhere as soon as possible.
I think it's a matter of taste. I prefer the build of the libraries to be integrated in the Xcode build of the app project instead of adding an additional external build step. I also like that you can instantly debug in to the source of libraries without any additional setup. I guess sooner or later the Swift package manager will be an alternative to both tools. Keeping my fingers crossed for this years WWDC :)
Much prefer Carthage myself, as well. CocoaPods is pretty convenient, but I’ve always hated the way it makes itself the boss of my project.
Carthage is better but often you can do what it does with a few lines of shell script and know exactly what’s happening. But I agree, let’s get rid of CocoaPods... 
One way is to use `NSDecimalNumber` and a rounding behavior: import Foundation let number = 1234.5678 var behavior = NSDecimalNumberHandler(roundingMode: .down, scale: 2, raiseOnExactness: false, raiseOnOverflow: false, raiseOnUnderflow: false, raiseOnDivideByZero: false) let decimal = NSDecimalNumber(value: number).rounding(accordingToBehavior: behavior) print(decimal) The other way is to use `Decimal` and `Int` to truncate: import Foundation let decimal = Decimal(Int(number * 100)) / 100 print(decimal) The first way is a bit cumbersome but it signals your intent better. The only issue is it's a bit of a throwback to Objective-C. The second way is more direct but a little less clear. The reason you want to use a decimal type like `Decimal` instead of a floating-point type like `Float` is because of how [numbers are represented in binary](https://ryanstutorials.net/binary-tutorial/binary-floating-point.php). Some values can be exactly represented in decimal but not in floating-point, that means you'll sometimes have difficulty truncating a floating-point type to decimal places. Of course if your intent is to just display a value to a user then `NumberFormatter` is absolutely the way to go. It's meant to convert between numbers and string representations.
Another thing. I was hoping to deploy this project sooner than later so instead of buying the books for node and express and all that, i was taking a look at google cloud sql which seems a lot less tightlaced than firebase. What do you think?
Can you elaborate? I’ve used CocoaPods for a while and like it but I don’t have a reference to compare to.
Is the App published on the App Store or TestFlight? If not, the developer name won't be displayed, as it's the name which get displayed in the App Store.
My opinion: both must be dropped and Apple should finally introduce an official dependency management. I simply cant understand how Apple kept ios 11 years without it ....
SPM may not ready for IOS
SPM
Not on App Store yet. Thank you!!
yep, unfortunately only for macos yet ... which already indicates that it will be crap. Looking at android + gradle for example you can see that the dependency management does not care about the target at all ... but apple always had to do everything on their own instead of cooperating with other companies (e.g. SPM, XCode etc.) and in the end it was always crap compared to others.
You do realize you're saying this in a Swift forum, right? The whole language is Apple doing it their own way, instead of picking any of the dozens of existing mature modern languages.
Preach it! We have 3 dependency management systems and they're all, ahem, suboptimal.
Googling your title leads straight to a StackOverflow question, with several possible answers. Maybe you could start by telling us what specific issues you have with those answers?
Carthage doesn't let you use IBDesignable, which is the only reason I still use cocoa pods.
No need to wait for Swift LSP necessarily, there's a very good plugin for VSCode called Maintained Swift Development Environment that offers fairly decent autocomplete. To get the full benefits, you do need to compile sourcekite, but it isn't that hard.
Turing completeness doesn't have anything to do with whether Swift has the appropriate libraries and frameworks are in place to support the domain-specific activities for which PHP is designed and optimised, though.
I’m rooting for SPM too, indeed ;) However there is an option to be able to edit the dependency source and see the change immediately: the use-submodule option combine with direct xcodeproj integration.
Was wondering the same. Whenever I see a repository on GitHub that offers both, I always select the CocoaPods option by default.
Sorry but it’s pretty much not possible any more :( a client I work with has spent a lot of time and money rearchitecting their security model to support WKWebView.
CocoaPods has and is fully dependent on a central repository. In itself this is already bad. Otherwise it forces you to use the generated Xcode workspace it generates for you. You generally have much less control over your project than by using any other dependency management.
Wake me up when we can use it for iOS 
Your `bannerView` is just an instance of `UIView` which, as the compiler error is so kindly telling you, does not have the variables you are trying to assign. Also, hard to help specifically if you provide no links or references to the tutorial in question. You're probably looking for something like the `GADBannerView` or something framework specific. 
Your `bannerView` needs to be of type `GADBannerView` not `UIView`. You'll need to change it in your storyboard as well as your ViewController.swift

Well, Devslopes itself was kind of a get-rich-quick scheme. I put nearly a grand into buying slopes because I was stupid and believed that they were in it for the long haul. I went through them all and they were good (incidentally, they were taught by not-Mark almost exclusively; Johnny, Caleb, and Jason did almost all of these courses and he did...no idea what) but I bought them at the price that I did because I expected Mark to follow through on his word and keep them updated. And they haven't been. 
Blaming the victim is classic. If you're upset you automatically didn't use what you learned. For me that's not true; I code for a living. I bought this expecting it to be the last thing I'd need to buy on those topics. He robbed his customers. &amp;#x200B; BTW I'm really a customer, not just piling on.

I dont see you using rectangleOfSize in this code. Also, I think you need to make that a "convenience init" because you define it yourself. The "Convenience init" should call the real, official init (such as rectangleOfSize maybe?)
I've been looking for a \`.swiftlint.yml\` ruleset for the [Google style guide](https://google.github.io/swift/) but haven't been able to find it. Maybe I'll have to write it myself. For now I just have the style guide open in my browser and take a look when in doubt.
I agree that what he's doing is wangjangling bull tacos. However, I just got an email from him (timestamped Mon, 4 Feb 2019 12:03:18 -0800 (PST)⁩ ) advertising his "**Ultimate iOS Masterclass**." So apparently he's not done yet. The emails strong call to action reeks of cash grab desperation. 
Have you tried installing a \`UITapGestureRecognizer\`?
It’s unfortunate that you paid the amount you did. I hope your still learning from other resources. I also wonder if those instructors were paid with more than “exposure”. I remember him calling out for developers to help out.
Missing? You make up your own code style for yourself/your organization. If it's missing it's only because you haven't done that.

Actually, just sign up for Swift forums! I do that and you can discuss with community!
Sounds interesting; is there any tooling for integrating the library xcodeproj or do you do this manually?
I've never used google cloud sql before :) sorry - p.s hackchildinc was my old account this is my new one. Best
I’ve found that occasionally the new build system will forget to rebuild things you’ve changed, so you end up compiling and running something, and you don’t get the changes in code you think you’re getting. This is for mostly vanilla Objective-C projects. I used to know exactly what triggered it but I’ve forgotten at this point since it’s been a few months. Very annoying. Because of this I’ve manually set my projects to use the old build system.
It's a joke. At WWDC they held a session about SPM that was literally them asking the crowd, "What would you like to see in SPM?" Fact: They don't know what we want out of dependency management.
\`pod install cocoapods --pre\` to install the 1.6.0.beta.2, which has proper support for the new build system. If you are editing pods directly you will still need to rebuild that pod, or make clean. We've been shipping production code for about 3 or 4 months this way with no issues.
Could you substantiate this?
Are you just trying to get a database up and running easily with little configuration? Id suggest firebase overall. EVEN though - i do not recommend it. But based on your use case im hearing - sounds like its the best option for you.
Oh, that’s interesting, i’ll definitely give it a try. Thanks!
I agree, Auto layout is completely horrible. Any open minded person can see that. Problem is, Apple elicits a cult mentality that is pretty toxic actually. Fanboys refuse to admit Apple can do wrong even while so much of what Apple does now sucks badly. Perhaps they own Apple stock and want to keep it afloat with BS.
Yeah, never again. I have to understand that if I'm happy with what's there for the price, then anything else is icing. 
Check this session from 2017 WWDC https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/219 It’s very useful
Yeah, that email is what sent me out looking for more information and only succeeded in getting my ire rankled. I went to the Discord server (which was official at the start but is now unofficial) and saw a link to the YouTube video, and now I'm just so very angry. 
It is done easily. First drag and drop the project’s dependency directly in the xcodeproj, then you can drag and drop the framework from the “Products” group in the dependency’s xcodeproj in your project and it should work. (It’s been a while since I’ve done that, but it’s possible now a simple drag and drop of the dependency in the project is enough.)
So my guess is that I'm not the only person who sent him an angry email, because I got a very quick reply: &amp;#x200B; \[redacted\] you have access to all content. Your email must have been in the wrong list. You own all of this already. 
You mean, you can't use the view classes from a framework installed with Carthage as designables? Why wouldn't that work?
Technically it's an Apple bug. carthage ibdesignable doesnt work
But we like swift ;) 
The basic bar, pie, line charts etc. Pretty interesting!
Not done = trying to get as much as he can out of it. Not a bad move ... if people who buy understand what they will get exactly. Actually you can get the exact content I think on udemy for cheaper.
Yeah totally agree. We paid form a service / product and didn’t get what was expected. That’s why we are annoyed. Isn’t this normal ?
Oh and by the way he just sent another email about his new course : how to make money online. https://academy.markwahlbeck.com/courses/making-money-online
hey it isn't macOS only!! &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; it also works for linux
&gt;In itself this is already bad. it's also really nice for looking for something that might solve your problem. their statistics on how much dependencies are used are neat too. i prefer carthage but will miss the centralized aspect of cocoapods. &amp;#x200B; also it's simple to make your own, or your company's own cocoapods source repo for internal deps, which is convenient.
For my company’s app I’m counting the days until I can rip out the last dependency that doesn’t support Carthage. Can’t wait.
They suck ass. Use the legacy build system until you have upgraded to Carthage.
Look in the superclass. The value is a property on all NSControls. I have no idea what those other comments are going on about.
CocaoPod**s***
can't*
Add a new view (tapView) to view after you add your results view. Set the size of tapView to as large as your view, enable user interaction on it, and then add a tap gesture recognizer to tapView and in its handler remove tapView and your results view. 
&gt; CocoaPods has and is fully dependent on a central repository. In itself this is already bad It's not bad if you just commit your dependencies. &gt; Otherwise it forces you to use the generated Xcode workspace it generates for you. All of your work still goes into your project's xcodeproj inside the workspace. What are you losing exactly? &gt; You generally have much less control over your project than by using any other dependency management. ???
I will, thanks!
I did but didn’t work for some reason. Only reason I could think of is that I’m confusing where to implement the functions, even though I’ve been going over things a million times. I reverted to shake to clear for now so I could upload it by tonight, but will revisit this for sure when I get some time again. Thanks!
That is a huge mess of horribly formatted code, and it won't even run without quite a bit of editing. The variable names, constants, and control flow are all weird, so it's hard to read. The StackOverflow question has different code, and invalid syntax. You say you tried 3 other things but don't show us the source code you used, or said how the results differed. You say there was an error but not what the error was. You would have an easier time getting people to help if you made it easier to help you.
Tried but no luck :( IIRC it either did nothing and I had the same issues where it worked on my results view but view was still touchable, or it made it so nothing would happen when I tapped.
This was the lazy/stubborn part of me not wanting to jump to this solution, but I likely will in the future lol. Thanks!!
Editing development pods? Or just third party. 
This is the code, it looked exactly like it did in my playground. But reddit made it look weird. The error was it doesn’t work look in your code and find out why. The same error every time. 
All of our dev pods are in KLO so I’m not sure but based on the behaviors I was seeing, I imagine both are affected equally. 
I forgot to mention, make sure resultsBackgroundView userInteractionEnaled:true
Set [textfield.keyboardType](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextinputtraits/1624457-keyboardtype) to decimal pad 
How do I change the scrolling recognition to be more strict vertically? So I have 2 swipe gesture recognizers on top of everything (whole ViewController) ones left swipe and other is right swipe. Among all these pages I also have a TableView with rows, and every time I try to left/right swipe between pages, the table vertical scroll engages its vertical scroll instead of the left/right recognizers, unless I try very accurately to scroll horizontal. So my question really boils down to: How do it change the scrolling recognition angle for TableView? Because the table's vertical scrolling is responding from touches around 90º \~ 10º. How do I narrow that angle? So that my main left/right pages respond easier without having to try to do a perfect horizontal swipe.
Thank you for the explanation. Tbh I am looking for detailed step-by-step tutorials for setting up Vapor with AWS, but can't seem to find any. I couldn't find out if Paul's book covers deployment to any platform at all. I will just go with Vapor Cloud if it reduces complexity. Besides this whole thing doesn't affect the user-facing app at all. It is for my understanding of app usage and prioritizing next release's feature set. I have a MySQL database on a GoDaddy hosting. I know how to export the data in the database as json and parse it on my local computer. In the future I will learn to automate it, instead of doing it manually. In that case do you believe that I just need something to run my Swift REST API code on a 24/7 server and connect it to read/write to the above-mentioned DB? I was looking into Vapor Cloud's [pricing page](https://vapor.cloud/pricing) and was confused by all the multiple objects in the page: Hosting, Database, Redis, file storage. I just need hosting, right? 
&gt; I couldn't find out if Paul's book covers deployment to any platform at all. I will just go with Vapor Cloud if it reduces complexity. Sure, go with Vapor Cloud if that makes it easier. Later, you can always dive into a Linux DYI-solution. &gt; In that case do you believe that I just need something to run my Swift REST API code on a 24/7 server and connect it to read/write to the above-mentioned DB? It's often a hassle to run a database on another server. It's possible, but it's a hassle (you want that database protected by a firewall). Looking at the Vapor Cloud page, I think it offers both the hosting of your code, as well as a database. And that's what I would advise.
Yes it does and has since long ago…
Yes, it's dope to pull in your precompiled 3rd party stuff, but holy shit, Carthage sucks big time when you are developing frameworks! Build takes ages, it might hang here and there, it's just horrendous. But yes, quick and easy for high level dependency.
iPad doesn’t support decimal keypad
Try out this tutorial [https://www.raywenderlich.com/433-uigesturerecognizer-tutorial-getting-started](https://www.raywenderlich.com/433-uigesturerecognizer-tutorial-getting-started)
There is a way to use Carthage that simplifies the builds, even when developing a framework (submodule+direct xcodeproj integration).
Yep, submoduling is also a nightmare to maintain. I don't want to glorify cocoapods but it's more suitable for our current project needs.
There are two types of notifications; local and remote. If your app is using local notifications, notifications generally happens by using “Background App Refresh”. Basically iOS wakes up the app from time to time. App may query courier web sites and show notifications if there is a change in status. However this is not reliable. I guess the app you are talking about probably using remote notifications. When you add your tracking number, it stores in its server. Server queries the courier web site periodically and sends notifications if there is any change. If you want to be sure, use some kind of proxy and listen to your device’s network traffic.
That’s what I suspected. Thanks a lot, learned something today :)
UI sounds like it will be a simple list with button to add your own items. I would check out Firebase for a real time database to post/query the items. 
I have built some basics apps before following YouTube tutorials and such. Im not sure where to begin with something like this. Thank for your help.
the result is D O G...
have some karma.
have a look at the "Stanford Uni iOS developer" course on iTunesU, if I remember correctly the first video is a matching card game which I'm sure could be adapted to something like this
Dog, dude. The answer’s dog. 
A good overview of the A* algorithm and the implementation of a priority queue looks solid. I'll have to test it out in a project or two when I get a chance.
Hi there. I'm the creator of the website. I create programming learning courses that are made of different podcast episodes but on the same topic. You can, for example, choose a course on the basics of algorithm and learn about complexity theory, graph algorithms and some basic algorithms like sorting. What I realized is that I learn so much from podcasts and that I'd like to have a service like that - a place where I can listen to a finite number of podcast episodes on a very specific topic and to learn from it. Something like an online learning courses. I really like the idea that you can learn while commuting, running, cooking or whatever. I recently found a wonderful Fireside Swift podcast so I decided to create few courses based on their podcasts. I created the website two weeks ago as an experiment to find out whether people would find it useful. I add about 4-5 new courses every week. What I plan in very soon future - shared course notes, course quiz, smartphone app Let me know if you have any questions or feedback, I'm happy to answer it.
SpriteKit + GameplayKit
Try this https://www.raywenderlich.com/2187-how-to-make-a-letter-word-game-with-uikit-and-swift-part-1-3
Then again, OP asked an extremely general question.
You might honestly be able to get away with a uicollection view with three and maybe two types of cells. So use a flow layout and then have 3 sections. First is obviously your picture and set a certain size and the second is n number of squares and finally the third is your rotated cells with letters. You could do 3 cells and just rotate your label. Or you can do a custom layout and anything in the third section has a rotation. Uicollectionviews take a little bit of time to get the hang of but they are super powerful. Finally just make the taps of the third section move animate to their respective positions and fade out once it's over and set the value of the label it's meant for. 
No. It is was good for 2014, but it is much more complex than SpriteKit which has become available in the meanwhile.
Think I prefer the LinkedIn one myself
Are you sure this is still the case for recent versions of iOS? The most recent issue I’ve seen regarding this is from 2015. Regardless I’d give it a shot, then try the other keyboard types like numbersAndPunctuation
iPad has never supported a decimal only keyboard, ever.
I've never used Sprite kit for a production app but understanding UIKit can help you learn iOS. Hence the link, never done games anyways so can't comment on the complexity. 
For the UI I would create some sort of clearer separation of the letters that are options to fill in the blank. Perhaps just a horizontal line. Otherwise looks good. On small note: If you change the "K" to another "T" the user could spell "DOG BUTTS" - nice feature.
I know it hasn’t for past versions. I asked specially about recent versions (iOS 10, 11, 12). You‘re probably right but your answer makes it sound like you haven’t actually checked. 
I would look into a way to get the change updates from the carrier. I assume you'll have several carriers and many packages at each one, so if there's some way to get updates straight from them and blend them together into one. Maybe make a system where if there's no update for a given package after a while, then hit up the server. Part of this would depend on how many packages you intend on tracking and from how many carriers, but going out to get info on a package vs getting updates from their server might be too much. Example: I had one package from China and it didn't update for like a week, another was updated like every day.
No Comic Sans. 
I just tested decimalPad keyboardType on iOS 12 iPad pro 3rd generation and it worked fine. There's a simulator specific bug that requires you to "toggle software keyboard" under "Hardware", but after that it works. Device works as expected.
It was a good article, however, that read like it was written by a high schooler.
This is what I’d do, throw in a little Core Animation to make it look nice and you’re good to go. 
get everything centered, remove comic sans, and use a higher quality picture of a dog. also, change that k to a t ;)
Lol, my favorite font!!! (When I was 15)
I got my start on Swift watching “The new Boston” on YouTube. Just watch every tutorial, follow along, if your confused by one watch it over till you got it. Probably don’t need to watch them all, the topics get overly advanced for this project. 
Yeah but it still shows the a-z and has the numbers across the top ?
Thanks everyone really appreciate the help! 
It didn’t for me. It might be because I designated my app as iPhone only, so when it runs on iPad it runs in a window with the screen size of an iPhone. Not sure if that has anything to do with it but it worked as expected with only numbers and decimal
Definitely give it a go if you ever will! SpriteKit is awesome (physics, inverse kinematics, etc) and pretty simple to use.
Haha thanks for this. I actually skimmed over this, but because I was in somewhat of a rush to send it out, I didn’t implement it. It seemed like most of the tut was using IB, but I was doing everything programmatically so couldn’t add it that way. When I scrolled down to the programmatic section, it looked like it branches off of first going through the earlier parts, so I didn’t have time to parse through it. I’ll definitely take another stab at it with this article. Thanks!
I did actually :( lol. Thanks, I think I’m just not competent
I think it Chalkboard SE 
yes, you need to define collision mask on physics bodies of both nodes
The thing is you’ve only ever followed along with tutorials that tell you do this do that and it’ll work. Your not skilled enough to build a app of your own yet if that’s all you do is follow along with videos who everything for you. I suggest you read the learn to code with swift book and do all the labs so u don’t cheat yourself once you do that you should have a good amount of skill to do a simple app like the one above but right now your question is very vague and I’m not sure if your asking for us to tell you how to do it or to link you to a tutorial that will show u how to do it either way your not challenging yourself enough. 
I did that but it didn’t help. Still went past it
did you define it correctly? share your code regarding the masks
Is that the one from Apple in iTunes U? I’ll take a look thanks your right I only know what I’ve been shown so far
wall: class Wall: SKShapeNode { init(position: CGPoint, cat: UInt32, col: UInt32, width: CGFloat, height: CGFloat) { super.init() let blockWidth = size(breadth: width, approxSize: 100) let rect = CGRect(origin: position, size: CGSize(width: blockWidth, height: size(breadth: height, approxSize: 150))) self.path = CGPath(rect: rect, transform: nil) self.fillColor = .white self.strokeColor = .white self.zPosition = 1 let wallPhysicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(rectangleOf: rect.size) wallPhysicsBody.affectedByGravity = false wallPhysicsBody.isDynamic = false //wallPhysicsBody.usesPreciseCollisionDetection = true //wallPhysicsBody.restitution = 0 // wallPhysicsBody.linearDamping = 0 // wallPhysicsBody.friction = 0 // wallPhysicsBody.mass = 1 wallPhysicsBody.categoryBitMask = cat wallPhysicsBody.collisionBitMask = col wallPhysicsBody.contactTestBitMask = col self.physicsBody = wallPhysicsBody } } ball: class Character : SKShapeNode { let size : CGFloat = 24 init(cat: UInt32, col: UInt32, position: CGPoint) { super.init() let rect = CGRect(origin: position, size: CGSize(width: size, height: size)) self.path = CGPath(ellipseIn: rect, transform: nil) self.fillColor = .white self.strokeColor = .white self.zPosition = 1 self.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(circleOfRadius: size / 2) self.physicsBody!.affectedByGravity = true self.physicsBody?.isDynamic = true // self.physicsBody?.restitution = 5 //self.physicsBody?.friction = 5 //self.physicsBody?.linearDamping = 5 //self.physicsBody?.allowsRotation = true //self.physicsBody?.usesPreciseCollisionDetection = true self.physicsBody?.categoryBitMask = cat self.physicsBody?.collisionBitMask = col self.physicsBody?.contactTestBitMask = col } required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) { fatalError("init(coder:) has not been implemented") } } defining: let playerCat : UInt32 = 1 let playerCol : UInt32 = 2 let wallCat : UInt32 = 3 let wallCol : UInt32 = 4 let brick = Wall(position: position, cat: wallCat, col: wallCol, width: 75, height: 150) let centre = self.frame.width / 2 let top = self.frame.height player = Character(cat: playerCat, col: playerCol, position: CGPoint(x: centre - 75, y: top - 50))
Um idk it’s just in the iBooks store it’s made by apple and it’s good teaches you all u need to know to basically know about 10 percent of swift lol but it does get pretty advanced pretty quickly
I was going to downvote you, but then I read the article.
this works (written with SpriteKitDSL, but this is not the point) - private let playerCategory: UInt32 = 1 &lt;&lt; 0 private let labelCategory: UInt32 = 1 &lt;&lt; 1 private let spinnyCategory: UInt32 = 1 &lt;&lt; 2 // Get label node from scene and store it for use later self.label = self.childNode(withName: "//helloLabel") as? SKLabelNode self.label?.apply { $0.alpha = 0.0 $0.run(SKAction.fadeIn(withDuration: 2.0)) $0.physicsBody(SKPhysicsBody(rectangleOf: $0.frame.size)) { $0.isDynamic = true $0.affectedByGravity = false $0.usesPreciseCollisionDetection = true $0.categoryBitMask = self.labelCategory $0.collisionBitMask = self.spinnyCategory $0.contactTestBitMask = self.spinnyCategory } } // Create shape node to use during mouse interaction let w = (self.size.width + self.size.height) * 0.05 self.spinnyNode = SKNode.shapeNode(rectOf: CGSize.init(width: w, height: w), cornerRadius: w * 0.3) { $0.lineWidth = 2.5 $0.run(SKAction.repeatForever(SKAction.rotate(byAngle: CGFloat(Double.pi), duration: 1))) $0.run(SKAction.sequence([SKAction.wait(forDuration: 0.5), SKAction.fadeOut(withDuration: 0.5), SKAction.removeFromParent()])) $0.physicsBody(SKPhysicsBody(rectangleOf: $0.frame.size)) { $0.isDynamic = true $0.affectedByGravity = false $0.usesPreciseCollisionDetection = true $0.categoryBitMask = self.spinnyCategory $0.collisionBitMask = self.labelCategory | self.spinnyCategory | self.playerCategory $0.contactTestBitMask = self.labelCategory | self.spinnyCategory | self.playerCategory } }
Holy cow that dump command. How have I missed this?
It’s great right? It’s an absolute life saver.
I can help you with this project...it's the "O"
Thanks 
It's blowing my mind. I've been using Swift since 2.0 and somehow never knew about it. I've been manually creating these ridiculous debugDescriptions to do exactly this.
Honestly everyday I discover something new about swift and it’s so amazing. Officially my favourite programming language now! ❤️
&gt;isDynamic = false BWT \`isDynamic = false\` means that all physical simulation is disabled for this body, so better remove it.
"How to easily cast firebase data" For me easily means Codable(or similar). Just extend JSONDecoder and write a similar function to this: https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/blob/master/Foundation/JSONEncoder.swift#L1107 If you don't want copy pasting code and don't mind some performance loss then use JSONSerialization to convert your dictionary to data and call the original function. If you want better performance then copy the code of _JSONDecoder and skip the "topLevel = try JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data)" and instead just use "topLevel = snapshot.value"
Hey @Cyberbeni, That’s great advice. I’m still learning so this list will improve :) I’ll add you suggestion in. 
1. There's no Swift related content in this question. 2. In the USA, IQ tests have been *generally* illegal for job applicants for several decades, so I don't know where you live or what it is you think you're replacing. 3. More generally, you don't say what kind of "puzzle game" it is or what types of jobs you'd target, or how this game might be at all relevant to a job application. Based on the available information, for the love of all that is good, **no**, do not do this. At best it would be a useless waste of time. More likely, it would discriminate candidates on factors that you don't think it does or should discriminate on, and therefore would be illegal for any company to use. Unless your app is called "Lawsuit Generator" and it's meant to bait companies, or unless it's only to be used when interviewing candidates for the explicit purpose of playing that specific puzzle game all day at work, then there is no logical reason to add an "interview mode".
9. Swift is more than just iOS development ;) (5, 7, 8 are the only swift-specific things)
The app didn't need to do any of the snooping on device, it was a [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) (and there are many other legitimate ones on the store). In fact, it used to be distributed through the App Store as "Onavo" until they were kicked off. They simply used the Enterprise system to continue putting it on people's phones after Apple banned the app. The actual spying took place on their VPN servers - they could analyze all of the traffic going in and out of the phone regardless of what app was being used.
Oh snap! That’s an awesome point! I’m gonna add it. 🙂🙂🙂
https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki//System/Library/PrivateFrameworks
Thanks!
according to this article: https://www.recode.net/2019/1/30/18203231/apple-banning-facebook-research-app Facebook could also spy on private messages. Does VPN allow you to do that?
Devslopes is NOT DEAD apparently ... [https://code.devslopes.com/d/273-is-devslopes-dead](https://code.devslopes.com/d/273-is-devslopes-dead) Is Devslopes dead? No, not exactly. I want to give everyone a heads up on the happenings at Devslopes. I'll just give it to you straight. I started Devslopes in 2015. It took off fairly quickly. I really wanted it to become a platform and a startup, so as the money came in I hired people. We built iOS apps, Android apps, a tvOS app, and a couple of Mac apps. The employees needed to support such an operation cost the company $60,000 - $70,000 a month in payroll expenses. Unfortunately, our platforms never were profitable. It was a bad decision on my part -- i just wanted to build stuff, but software wasn't what people wanted. It was the courses people wanted and always had been. But since we had been getting really great at software development, we really wanted to keep building, so we tried to allocate our engineers over to our Cache project and build a decentralized Q&amp;A platform. We raised enough money to build that, but then crypto dropped to 1/3 its value and our reserve funds dropped to a couple of months. I spent my life savings trying to keep the team on payroll. It just still couldn't work out. So I had to let *everyone* go. Now, Devslopes is just me. I'm trying to strip away all of the junk and waste and things that were not profitable. We still have a big audience and a lot of people who are interested in buying more courses. But right now it is just me. **I'm trying to find talented teachers who want to partner up and make courses at Devslopes.** But this is not easy. At one point we had 7 course partners we were working with, and each one of them did NOT finish the course they were working on -- life came up and they "just couldn't finish". Apparently making courses is hard. And it is 📷 So, I'm just trying to figure everything out. Devslopes took a BIG financial blow, but it's not dead and doesn't have to be. What will likely happen in the short term is that I will personally produce iOS courses. I would love to find a great teacher partner for games, and maybe another for React. I'll keep you all posted on this. I understand that a lot of you are upset. I have many angry letters in my inbox, as well as a few death threats. I feel somewhat powerless to keep everyone happy at the moment, but I'm going to do my best to figure it out. What I know is, that if I can find some talented teachers, that we can produce and grow and give you what you want -- so if you have anyone in mind, let me know. With our software completely out of the picture, all payroll will be simply for content creation and I would anticipate growth. But I need the instructors first. I'm open to suggestions and hope you can bear with me. Mark
SMS messages do not use internet connection, so Facebook couldn't know about them. &amp;#x200B; For other "private messages" it depends, if the app that was sending those messages used proper end-to-end encryption then VPN should't have access to the content. They could know that user was sending them though.
FYI, to tag reddit users in comments we use `/u/` instead of `@`, so for example: /u/Fried---Chicken 
I don't know about setTimeOut in javascript, but if you only want to delay things then it's probably nicer to use GCD rather than set a non-repeating timer like in #5. For example: DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 1) { print("This is delayed.") } &amp;#x200B;
That article isn't clear on what they mean by "track ... their private messages." Is it possible for the VPN to examine the contents of the messages? Maybe, it would depend on the specifics the messaging system and what kind of encryption they are using. They might be able to see the contents, or they be able to see who you're talking to. But Facebook probably doesn't care. They have piles of data from FB Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc. if they want to examine that. People upload their address books all the time, too. Google has visibility into your gmail accounts and calendars. Rather, what FB and Google really want to see is what people do on their phones outside of their systems. They are trying to spot the next Snapchat, or WhatsApp, or Instagram before it gets too big to be bought or crushed. **The contents of your messages aren't as important as knowing what other messaging apps you're using and how much you're using them**. What features (like stories in Snapchat) are you using in other apps? How much time do you spend watching videos? Where do they come from? That is the kind information they want.
I love using it. One of my seniors years ago even ask me what the hell was that hahaha! Just an FYI, I tried using dumps to check some class instances while testing if deinit is getting called. What’s weird is that the deinit of one instance (after I set it to nil) won’t get called after adding dumps. When I deleted those dumps, deinit was finally triggered. Tried this to a separate youtuber project, too.
I love you both
I like your list! But I think your reduce example could be better. String concatenation is a poor place to use a reduce function because an intermediate string will be created at each iteration, wasting time. It would be better to use [`joined(separator:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sequence/1641243-joined). Reduce is a useful function, though. A better example might be to compute the product of the elements of an array of integers: let nums = [1, 3, 5, 2, 5, 1, 6, 2, 4] let prod = nums.reduce(1) { $0 * $1 } print(prod) You might also explain how the first argument (1 in this case) is used as the initial value. And it may be beneficial to instead write out the variables in the closure for clarity: let nums = [1, 3, 5, 2, 5, 1, 6, 2, 4] let prod = nums.reduce(1) { (prev, curr) in prev * curr } print(prod) This explicitly shows that `$0` corresponds to the *previously computed value* resulting from the reduction of all previous elements and `$1` is the value of the current element in the iteration. (I typed this out on my phone, so please forgive any typos in the code.)

(Just in case) For swift reduce, you can also use logical operator as it’s combine closure argument: ``` let codes = ["abc","def","ghi"] let text = codes.reduce("", +) // "abcdefghi" ```
&gt; 3.) Use SnapKit instead of AutoLayout This is technically not correct. SnapKit uses AutoLayout as well. It’s just a DSL which makes it easier to use. 
Thank you /u/DonaldPShimoda! 🙂
Hey /u/halleys_comet69, Thanks for this. I will also add this to the list. There’s still a lot I don’t know about swift so I’m learning a lot already from everybody’s replies! 🙂
Hey /u/DonaldPShimoda this is a great point, I hadn’t thought about the performance impact. Initial I thought of using “Hello World” as an example because I thought it might be confusing for beginners to wrap their head around reduce. But looking at your example it’s very easy to understand so I’ll be adding it to the list 🙂 Thank you!
This is number 10, you’ve taught me something /u/anymbryne Thank you!
/u/fear731, Thanks for pointing this out, I’ll update the details 🙂
Enterprise apps don't have the same app review requirements as apps posted to the store since they're intended for internal use only. Apple doesn't review them at all, usually. It's meant for in-house apps for employees, not for external customer use or research. That's where they got in trouble.
Np :) btw good choice. We also use SnapKit.
I'm working to develop 2 app in this month both app will be ready to release soon . eTransfer24 is first app , it's about transfer money by card or locally another one title is School ring it's about connection between school and parent with mobile app and i need to improve my english skill first .
lol
You can create your own input view: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiresponder/1621117-inputviewcontroller
If you're an authorized MDM provider there is a whole suite of APIs that are not available to the average developer for controlling an monitoring devices. Automatically setting up a VPN is one of many features. I don't think you can find the API documentation publicly but if you look at the features of some of the top MDM providers you can see the type of features we're talking about here. Check out Airwatch or MaaS 360. Anything they can do is pretty much guaranteed to use official MDM APIs they would never use private frameworks as it's too risky and against ToS.
FWIW this has pretty much nothing to do with enterprise singing an internal app. That alone does not give you access to anything special it's only about distribution to apps not registered for ad-hoc signing and not distributed through the App Store / Test Flight.
Does it help at all if I said the multiplier was almost always 1?
This will definitely work (I do it all the time). Make sure that resultsBackgroundView is the same size of the screen and the background color is not UIColor.clear. Post your code if you're still having issues.
Check out snapkit - one thing that has helped is applying constraints in snapkit (where they made more sense) and then apply the same constraints through auto etc until you get the same appearance.
Will do, thank you!
I started with Swift just this week, so this is great timing. Thanks!
Glad I could help. You’re welcome :)
Let's not nitpick: they asked about a language that's generally used for server-side web development, we can at least make that inference. The appropriate response would therefore be "**if** you are referring to server-side web development, then yes, there are technologies such as Vapor, Kitura, Perfect, and others to help with that; can you be more specific?" You know, in the spirit of *actually* being helpful.
One thing I have to do is explore the Fibonacci Heap data structure to see if that works with my design.
Happy to help. Cheers! :)
Is there a reason for choosing a struct to store your scores? How about an array of scores?
Call the notification center's `post` method to send a notification. Supply the name of the notification and the object to pass as arguments. In your example it would look like the following: NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .didReceiveData, object: nil) 
I saw it described as the best way to store static variables that have to be shared across multiple view controllers (which I need to do), but I’m in over my head a bit and just followed that blindly- do you know if an array would work for that as well?
Seems like a great list! I would suggest adding a few things tho: 1. Type erasure Every beginner ends up running into this problem. They have some protocol: ``` protocol AppState { associatedtype Context var id: Int { get } func load() } ``` And want an array of that: ``` var array: [AooState] = ... ``` Oops! They get an error. The way to do so is: ``` struct AnyAppState { let base: Any let id: Int { return _id } func load() { _load() } private let _id: Int private let _load: () -&gt; Void init&lt;T: AppState&gt;(base: T) { self._id = base.id self._load = base.load } } ``` 2. GYB Image writing an extension on `Int`. ``` extension Int { func isMultiple(of value: Int) -&gt; Bool { return self % value == 0 } } ``` Then you must write manually on all int types (`Uint`, `Int32`, etc...) In GYB you just write: ``` %{ bits = ['', '8', '16', '32', '64'] signs = ['', 'U'] }% % for bit in bits: % for sign in signs extension ${sign}Int${bit} { func isMultiple(of value: ${sign}Int${bit}) -&gt; Bool { return self % value == 0 } } % end % end ``` Hows that for preventing code repetition &gt; Note that this one takes just a little bit of setup. Refer to [this great article](https://nshipster.com/swift-gyb/) on how to get started.
Make sure you have the name exactly right. Case sensitivity isn't the same between the simulator and the device. One is case sensitive, and one is case insensitive (but I don't remember which is which).
Ok will do, so do u know if it matters where the file is, like what folder i put it in? Do I need to fully qualify the path of the file also?
If it's working on the simulator, you probably have it in the right spot.

Same problem here, I’m learning Swift with Swift Playgrounds for 10 days now. You got this in many situation in your life. It’s all about experience. If you repeat it you can do it after some time, sometimes it takes longer but keep it up. Just don’t give up, this is the difference between someone who actually can programming and someone who can’t. 
When you set the cell values in the tableview function, set the tag of the button to the indexPath.row. When the button is pressed use the tag to identify it. Using sections makes this more difficult but it can still be done if you have a indexPath to int function you create based off of your data structures. 
Relax dude, I just made a one-line reply to your comment, which someone else downvoted. OP won’t be helped more or less for that reason. 
I have a long way to go as I still don’t understand a lot of the tips in this beginner list...
Oh that would have worked too. I ended up going with an extension to UITableView that introduces the function indexPathForView().
You should somehow group the learnings, as it would soon grow into a jungle of personal hacks. Also sticking to SnapKit instead of Autolayout is kinda tricky. Autolayout is backed by system and should be studied first no matter what. BTW in your “reduce” example found no difference between swift and JS at all, just syntax.
In case you're still struggling, I created a gist recently to demonstrate something very similar to what you're doing. Have a look [here](https://gist.github.com/SaganRitual/9c02171302b1874ed8795a0f7551aa5e) if you like. Peace and luck
Add the following to the struct: var sum:[Int] {return [firstoptionalint + secondoptionalint + (etcetera)].compactMap{$0}}
Welcome to 2008. People like me, developing for iOS since that time, remember how we used to do back then. Man, I realized now that I develop for iOS for almost 11 years!!!!!!!!!!!!
You might want to elaborate on your question.
From my understanding the Fibonacci Heap is good in theory but often not in practice because of the large amount of storage it needs per node and high constant factors. It's also a pain to implement properly.
1. How to use the GKBehaviors in GameplayKit. See my hard-won [example](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45652822/1610473) on StackOverflow for a working snippet, or the complete [repo](https://github.com/SaganRitual/AgentFlocks/tree/develop/AgentFlocks) of a GameplayKit UI that I tried to create but gave up on when I discovered that so few people use GameplayKit. 2. There's no need to use CoreData to save your app data. JSON encode/decode is just fine unless you have something huge or database-like. 3. Xcode 1. You're not doing anything wrong when Xcode crashes, even if it crashes all the time. It's Xcode, not you. 2. The first troubleshooting step when anything goes wrong (including your app compiling incorrectly and acting like it has a bug) is to delete DerivedData/\* 3. Any time you pull, merge, change branches, or anything else that causes any file in your local repo to change by even a single character, you must first quit Xcode and delete DerivedData/\*, or you're just asking for trouble. For good measure, do it even when you commit to your local repo--I have indeed seen it crash from that as well. 4. Xcode is quite a bit more sophisticated than you might think from the constant crashing. It has some nice tools, like one for tracking memory leaks and related issues, and another tool for profiling your app in a thousand different ways. 4. The word "map" does not mean the same in Swift as it does in C++. In Swift, it's a verb. In C++, it's a noun that means "dictionary" in Swift (and Javascript) 5. How to use Grand Central Dispatch. It's trivial, once you figure it out. But when I scoured the internet for working examples, there weren't any--just a lot of non-working examples, which caused me to waste a lot of my time I gripe a lot, This list took me only ten minutes. I'm sure I can come up with more if I spend another ten on it.
More Xcode: no, you're not going nuts. The "find in project" function really doesn't support regex, although the "find in this file" function does. Rather than regex, you can use the...oh my God, you can use the **magnifying glass** next to the input field, then...Jesus Christ, **choose "insert pattern"** from the dropdown, and...dear Oprah, **use one of the clunky button-things** to search on word break, etc. Did I say something earlier about the worst UI in history? I was wrong; this one is worse. Insult to injury: they had already implemented a reasonable regex function for their find-in-this-file, but decided to keep this monstrosity for find-in-project
You can’t bundle multiple frameworks into one, this is called an ‘umbrella framework’ and Apple strictly disallows it, as per their docs. You could just copy over the RxSwift source into your framework and compile it all as one framework, but this could cause clients to run into weird issues if they were to separately import RxSwift. The best solution is to have them use some dependency manager like Carthage or Cocoapods, and have RxSwift be a dependency of your framework. So for example specify it in your podspec, or tell clients to use it in their Cartfile
Yes I think about specifying 
if I need global variables I do it like this: &amp;#x200B; `class global {` `static var items: [Int] = []` `static var objc: [String:Int] = [:]` `}` &amp;#x200B; use in multiple view controllers like this: `let sum = global.items.reduce(0,+)` &amp;#x200B; I don't know if this is anywhere near best practice, but this is how I do it and how I got it working, it could probably be done as struct, too, depends on what you need.
&gt; /u/fear731 No problem. I also just started a while back and I'm collecting things as I go along. I'm gonna keep updating it as I discover new things, so keep your eyes open :P
I'm sure there are things you know that I don't know. I'm also a beginner too. If you have any thing you've discovered that you think would help fellow beginners, please feel free to fork the repo, add your points and raise a pr back into the repo to help me and others a like. 😊
Good suggestion, I will make an index at the top with links to each tip for easy reading. I will also updated the SnapKit point with your suggestion. Thanks a lot ☺️
Hey, This is an amazing list of suggestions! Thanks, as there is a lot of points, I will take some time to format them nicely before adding them to the list. But thanks ever so much! Really cool points :) 
/u/SaganRitual Same as before, I will add these with the rest :)
Oh I like the GYB example, very very cool. I'm going to add these two to the list. Thanks for the suggestions! 🙂
Do note that this particular example could be written as: extension BinaryInteger { func isMultiple(of value: Self) -&gt; Bool { return self % value == 0 } } 
&gt;Welcome to 2008 I mean, 3D touch came out around 2014. While it's been around for nearly 5 years, it's still relatively new to a lot of people. Here's to hoping 2019 iPhones don't do away with the technology. Personally enjoy the peek and pop functionality a lot.
I really like this feature in swift (and rust). I use it alongside functional composition for some more robust message passing/error handling. I've gone a step further and implemented some of the typical 'monad'-like functionality alongside it to make the transformation code a bit simpler. For example, ``` enum Box&lt;T&gt; { case just(T) case nothing case error(ErrorType) } extension Box { func flatMap&lt;U&gt;(_ fun: @escaping (T) -&gt; Box&lt;U&gt;) -&gt; Box&lt;U&gt; { switch(self) { case .just(let value): return fun(value) case .error(let error): return .error(error) case .nothing: return .nothing } } } ``` map would look like `func map(_ fn: @escaping (T) -&gt; U) -&gt; Box&lt;U&gt;` and wrap the result of the applied function, and apply would be a wrapped function that gets unwrapped and mapped
Sure thing: #1 Search google for some swift code to grab colours from UIImage. There are tons. Checkout “ColourMatchTabs” repository #2 Apply the UIColor that u get as a response from ColorMatchTabs to the UIStatusBar.appearance() config #3 Apply the UIColor that u get as a response from ColorMatchTabs to the UINavigationBar.appearance() config “barTintColor” And you are good to go :) Happy to elaborate further if needed.
```for label in view.subviews where label is UILabel { print("Found a label with frame \\(label.frame)") }``` 
Can you give an example of how a more elegant solution might look like?
How can it get more concise? Maybe you could do: _ = myView.map { view.addView($0) } Although not sure if map can return void
`myViews.forEach(self.addSubview(_:))`
Improving my first app outside of work – [Circumnavigate](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/circumnavigate/id1443182423?mt=8) It’s super simple at this stage - it shows you how many steps your phone thinks you’ve done for all time, and plots this number against large distances like the circumference of the Earth, with the option to add your own distances for comparison. I’ve been a full time iOS developer for over 5 years now, with several apps published to the store. But this is the first time I’ve had the motivation to work on one of my own ideas to a point where it’s ready for public consumption! The aim is to keep upgrading and improving it, integrating things like Siri, Today Widgets, iMessage apps - all the things I find I never get a chance to do as part of a commercial product!
Perfect!
Not sure if this matters without seeing what you have inside your loop. But forEach loops can't `break` or `continue`.
That's fine. This is a very basic use case where I'm looking for it to be concise.
This explanation re-triggers my imposter syndrome
I hate to say it but it looks like they may be doing away with it. It’s a shame. Neither Apple nor 3rd parties pushed it enough. It has so much untapped potential. 
haha believe me it took a bit of time for me to fully grok monad concepts at first. i think i read that illustrated monad explanation about 10 times.
1. Go to Erik Burnoth's github page and see the pure [awesomeness](https://github.com/erikbgithub) people have built into simple command-line git. 2. Get into the habit of committing often; it's very useful to have quick snapshots to go back to while you're experimenting with different solutions. Don't worry about having lots of commits. You can squash them all down into a single commit when you're done with your changes. Add this to your `~/.gitconfig` &amp;#8203; [alias] # Or look for the [alias] section, which might already be there defend = commit -am"Defensive" And then periodically go to the terminal: ~/Projects/Ipsum:&gt; git status ... modified: Mutator/Mutator.swift modified: NSCommon/KAppDelegate.swift modified: NetFrame/Lorem.swift no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a") ... ~/Projects/Ipsum:&gt; git defend ... [exp dcaf1c1] Defensive 10 files changed, 165 insertions(+), 32 deletions(-) ~/Projects/Ipsum:&gt; It's ok if it looks like the following. You can run git rebase -i 9fc674e and squash all those down into a single commit with a message that makes you look way smart. ~/Projects/Ipsum:&gt; git log * dcaf1c1 - (HEAD -&gt; exp) Defensive (5 minutes ago) &lt;Samantha Paulos&gt; * 713c313 - Defensive (19 hours ago) &lt;Samantha Paulos&gt; * 5d3744d - Defensive (19 hours ago) &lt;Samantha Paulos&gt; * 8c0d592 - Defensive (20 hours ago) &lt;Samantha Paulos&gt; * 88f1dcb - Defensive (21 hours ago) &lt;Samantha Paulos&gt; * 43a1a06 - Defensive (25 hours ago) &lt;Samantha Paulos&gt; * 730abbf - Defensive (28 hours ago) &lt;Samantha Paulos&gt; * 9fc674e - Accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos (2 days ago) &lt;Samantha Paulos&gt; * 2b8ca4b - (origin/exp, dev) Quod maxime placeat facere possimus (3 days ago) &lt;Samantha Paulos&gt; Also, add this alias to .`gitconfig` to get a git log with syntax hilighting: # Usage # ~/Projects/Ipsum -&gt; git hlog hlog = log --color --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)&lt;%an&gt;%Creset' --abbrev-commit
Could it be that unnecessary space between as? and FeebackViewController? There's like a good 2-3 spaces in between
It's okay to not grok Functional Programming. You can be a great developer without knowing it at all!
Update your question with where the text file is in your app bundle and the code you wrote to load the file from the app bundle. Without that information, no one here can tell you what the problem is.
Sorry that's just me messing up the Reddit formatting when I copied and pasted my code. It is 1 space in Xcode
Cool, just love unnecessary and uncalled for downvotes without explanation 
I love your content! It's my favorite to learn new things about Swift
Oh that's a riot. Based on his email to me, I already had access to it because of my slope purchase, but I have nothing new. So it's apparently just the same courses that Johnny and Caleb made a year or more ago. 
Awesome!! Thanks so much.

np! #upvote
I know - do you have another example on GYB?
Untapped... I see what you did there.
Does the SPM support iOS/watchOS/tvOS? or just server side swift.
Sadly, no.
IBM has support for swift on its newer versions of z/OS. Its possible some IBM shops might be adopting it for their back end.
clear derived data
Personally, I don’t consider it more elegant, but that’s a matter of taste. 
Hi developernoob! Unfortunately, the link to the App Store you submitted has been automatically removed from /r/Swift. This is because – generally speaking – compiled products are not relevant to /r/Swift (even if the app was originally written in Swift). If this is an app you have written, congrats on your acceptance to the App Store! A great way to promote it would be [Reddit advertising](https://www.reddit.com/advertising). If you would like to release its Swift source code, we would gladly accept a link to that. If the content you were submitting *was* in fact related to the subject of Swift programming, please [message the moderation team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fswift&amp;subject=Please%20review%20my%20removed%20App%20Store%20submission&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/anwy0r/are_there_any_libraries_for_this_effect/) to have it reviewed.

I remember when I had that epiphany. For me, it kind of took some of the joy out of learning new projects…some of the challenge was no longer there. Then I realized I preferred app development to web development and the world feels right again.
&gt; essentially paying them (the consumers) so that Facebook could spy on them. Not that it changes what the app actually did, I’d hardly call it spying when the user is informed about it, has consented to it and is payed for it. 
If there were a Swift library for the Google API, sure, but I don't think one exists yet.
Yeah, tbh I wasn’t really going by the strictest legal definition of the word, was kinda in a hurry so just needed to make sure people would know what I meant
I don't know who downvoted this, but this is fantastic. Makes using JavascriptCore much simpler for small snippets interacting with JS. Are you using the new dynamic features?
Or just .forEach()
If they had a more elegant solution, they'd not need to ask, surely. Unless you mean from another language? At any rate, the solution was to use .forEach(_:)
Yeah, from another language or a made up one, since his example was already very concise. Also he said there would be multiple statements inside so foreach would look identical in the end
:)
**let** filepath = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "/AppName/AppName/SupportFiles/", ofType: "txt") **let** dictionaryFile = **try** String(contentsOfFile: filepath + "myFile")
Tried this several times 
Hey guys, actually got it working, thanks for the suggestions.
cool
I don’t see a price blemish at the moment but do submit a bug report. 
Although it wouldn't work for `addSubview()` in particular, in situations where you can pass an array as a parameter, you can use `map()`. For example, if there were an `addSubviews(_ array: [Subview])`, then you could call `addSubviews(myViews.map({$0)}`. Peace and luck
Lol thank you for clarifying. I was seriously thinking there was yet another term I should know but did not...like radar
I was afraid that was the answer... 
Yes you can alter the UIImage itself but for your purposes it may suffice to simply set the content mode of the image view to aspect fill 
You can do literally whatever you want! It’ll be easier to find help for writing iOS/macOS apps with Swift, but you can use it for anything else too! I did some server side stuff in Swift recently with Vapor, it was very pleasant :)
I did this but the issue remains. Do you have any other tips?
Nice tutorial. Should you have made your `ViewControllerB`’s `delegate` property `weak` though, to avoid retain cycles? In this case it might be fine, as the first view controller doesn’t retain the second, but otherwise it could cause issues. Eg. The property created around 9:24 should be: `weak var delegate: ViewControllerBDelegate?`
A lot of the guys here write strictly for iOS, and most everyone here is very UI-oriented. But you can do awesome stuff with Swift even if you don't need a UI. I have a whole suite of utilities for my research, written on my mac, with no UI except a SpriteKit scene that I can use for displaying the state of whichever utility I'm running. I approached Swift with suspicion, because as a C++ snob, it seemed too easy, like a scripting language that does everything for you. I figured it would be slow like an interpreted language, but I did some benchmarks with my tools--it's fast. It's not C++, but it's fast. Anyway, if you can do it in C++, you can probably do it in Swift. I say "probably" only because I'm still new-ish to Swift, so I don't want to pretend to speak with authority. But so far, I haven't felt held back in the slightest by Swift. Peace and luck.
You can? I thought the Google Web Search API was taken down years ago.
The ViewController needs to hold the BlutetoothService instance. In your case the service is initialized and then immediately released when viewDidLoad() finishes.
&gt;var btService: BluetoothService! I'm crying haha. Thank you so much... I don't know how I missed it. I've been looking at this for way too long.
Thanks for the tip! I’ll leave a comment based on your feedback in the YouTube video :)
The introduction is highly misleading. &gt; They have 2 teams working together, one will write one line of code, and the other team will test that line of code for bugs. The quoted line is from a book about how *IBM* writes the Space Shuttle software. Project Apollo didn't use this methodology. It predates this by a few decades. You can go download the AGC software yourself -- it's public domain, and has been available on the internet since 2003. I don't see any unit tests there. It's raw assembly language. The architecture is not even close to being easily unit testable. &gt; The answer to this is that one should have a solid and powerful design beneath the application you are writing. Not using any design at all might lead to untestable code. So, which of these architectures do you think the AGC used? The iPhone's software has *infinitely* many more unit tests than the AGC. Would you still choose AGC to get you to the moon, given that you claimed testability was the reason to pick it in the first place? Even if you choose IBM style, unit tests are perhaps the *least* significant aspect of the process. They write (and scrutinize) a complete specification before writing any code. Every line of code is documented by about 1/2 page of requirements. For every bug found in the software, they go back and analyze their process to determine how it could have slipped past each step of their process. They go over their entire code base to see if a similar problem could have occurred anywhere else. They pay a second team to do nothing but find bugs in the first team's work. They have a manager who refuses to let any software ship unless he's willing to stake human lives on it. You do all that, and you won't *need* unit tests. On the flip side, simply using a fancy architecture and writing some unit tests, without caring deeply about process or correctness or reliability, won't get you all that much.
It's a general-purpose programming language, anything you can do in another language you can do in Swift.
Extra space really shouldn't cause an issue, the compiler compresses most whitespace down to 1 before interpreting the code.
/u/DonaldPShimoda I’ve now added your solution to the repo. Thanks 🙂
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness?wprov=sfti1
While a lot of these answers are technically correct, it’s not very honest to say that you can do “anything” with swift. Yes, it’s a general purpose programming language, but it doesn’t really have the wide spread tooling available as some like, say, JavaScript or C#. You mentioned that you’re new to programming, so I’ll try and break it down a bit. Languages like c++, Java, and JS are so popular is because of the frameworks built around them. One of the reasons that C# is so popular for video game dev is because that is the language that Unity uses. Microsoft’s uses c# for their cloud platform, azure. Swift and Objc are what’s used for iOS / macOS dev because Apple built their frameworks around these languages. At a high level, most programming languages and be used for anything. You just have to be practical about what you choose for each. When people say that you can use swift for “anything”, I imagine them solving a whiteboard problem. You can implement a quick sort algorithm in any programming language. Using Swift for something that it’s not really supported on yet, like Android, is a completely different monster and would require years of work to get the frameworks up to speed with Apples frameworks. I hope that makes sense. Short answer: Swift is used primarily for development on Apple products. However, people love the language so they are making it work on other platforms. The biggest example is probably Vapor, which is a serverside development framework for swift. 
I'm glad to hear it! I hope you've seen some of the [videos I've been adding to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/paulhudson) :)
Vapor is considered a framework? So instead of having to use a language like Java for backend, vapor let’s you use swift? Did I get that right?
what does the log say? where are you saving to? 
Downvoters, I'm not trying to be difficult here - I've spent the past three days trying to understand exactly what I am doing wrong here. I'm pulling my hair out because I just have absolutely no clue how I am supposed to connect these two systems or even if they're supposed to be connected in this way.
Thanks again for the feedback - I made this video ([https://youtu.be/cLK\_P\_djFlg](https://youtu.be/cLK_P_djFlg)) - would you mind watching it to let me know if it helps clear up the air? It's hard to explain memory management well. Let me know if I did it any justice - in context of reference types &amp; episode 4. Best!
Lol I am too. I just had this thought that even Apples software considers current Mac pricing to be a blemish upon Apple. That is really very funny when you think about it. 
Yes, exactly
[fully customizable loading button with 6 different styles](https://github.com/farshadjahanmanesh/loady)
Wait I realised the issues with this version of the code is that the QR Code can be generated but the constraints are messed up....can you plz help me :) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
CocoaPods 1.6.0 is out now that fixes these issues, among others. 
I am working on [a feature request](https://github.com/Swiftify-Corp/IHProgressHUD/issues/1) on the [IHProgressHUD](https://github.com/Swiftify-Corp/IHProgressHUD) which is a Swift version of [SVProgressHUD](https://github.com/SVProgressHUD/SVProgressHUD)
[https://photos.app.goo.gl/p8Y8rJpPNFFsHXeXA](https://photos.app.goo.gl/p8Y8rJpPNFFsHXeXA) &amp;#x200B; This is the "save" function that I tested on my iPhone 8. It looks worse on the iPhone Xr and Xs Max.
Did not get this... I have asked many people, still no answers. Basically I have developed a framework with Swift4.2 and have created a fat version of framework. I currently distribute this framework with cocoapods as a compiled framework. However, it will create problem for Swift 5, because the app which uses **swift 5 could not use library, written in Swift 4.2, correct?** Will Sfiwt 5 enable libraries support for newer languages and better implementation? All this time I regret using Swift for building a framework, because it creates lots of issues, many of which I did not understand up to today. Can someone assure me, will Swift5 enable **full support for frameworks?**
I wrote an \[article\]([https://medium.com/swiftify/swift-5-and-abi-stability-the-best-time-to-migrate-d4029d5342e9](https://medium.com/swiftify/swift-5-and-abi-stability-the-best-time-to-migrate-d4029d5342e9)) about ABI Stability and its implications on Application Developers and Framework developers. It also covers a bit of Module Stability. 
Why don't you test it? I can't give you a 100% definitive answer but if I understand correctly the implications of ABI stability it's that it will only impact Swift 5 and above. Swift 4.2 still needs to bundle the swift runtime library, so apps building against that should still bundle that library. For apps building against Swift 5, I think that linking against Swift 5 libs should work still _unless you are using some deprecated functionality that they have removed in swift 5_.
No explanation..... Are you retaining classes?
This is my app's memory graph after clicking in between tabs of my tabbar controller and generally using the app. I frequently download "posts" which are just a simple json data using firebase and alamofire. Is there a way to deallocate this memory once the view leaves the screen? I have used allocations profiler and the only large section of memory i see belongs to 'main'. I have added print statements into the deinit functions of each class to be sure they are deinit'd. what could be causing this steady increase but no release of memory?
Those animations are pretty jank. Needs a little material design animation love. 
Sorry lmao I had to write the explanation. No, I don’t believe I’m retaining classes. I’ve seen no memory leaks in the profiler and have used weak when referencing classes and protocols 
thank you, just give me some examples and I will add them soon 
Check [this](https://material.io/design/motion/understanding-motion.html) out. It's a very good resource on how to make animations feel real and natural. 
Viewcontrollers load their views the first time they are needed, so your app still launches fast when having a tab bar with a bunch of VCs in it and then loads the views 1 by 1 when you switch tabs. You don't want to free that memory. If anything, you want to start loading them 1 by 1 after the user gets to the first screen, so the initial switch to them will also be fast.
thank you, I will take a look at that link, some of these animations are used in big apps like uber... :(
That’s ok! They might be tricky to implement, but they look beautiful. I know you can get your library there. (I also didn’t notice you were the library’s author.)
 thank you about this, I am not a designer, I will look at dribbble and add some beautiful animations to make it better
So this memory increase should be expected? Also, again on the topic of memory, I have a main “timeline” where users can scroll down indefinitely until they run out of posts to view. However, loading this many posts can get memory intensive. Is there a framework to allow for easy memory management of these objects in a tableview setup? 
Facebook is a bubble, just look at the Tulips bubble or Beanie Babies.
I'd have to check Facebook compared to it's fundamentals, price to book, debt to equity, etc to know if it is a bubble or not. Big, successful companies are quite capable of being a bubble. Chipotle was a bubble a few years back before the whole disease scare. It lost (and rightfully so) almost half of its stock value because it was so ridiculously overvalued, that the first sign of stress made investors run screaming away. Facebook could definitely be in a similar boat.
Yes. Stuff that could be used often should stay in memory. It's more expensive to recreate them than to keep them in memory. Luckily tableviews and collectionviews reuse their views, so if you are at the 1000th row but only see the last 5 then those are the only views (and 1 or 2 more waiting to be reused), so only your model data increases the memory. If you are making an infinite scrolling app with possibly infinite data then the most important is to respond to memory warnings by disposing some data that will not likely be needed in the near future. For example check which row your tableview is at and only keep +/- 50 rows of data. And then you could also build up a local database from the posts because it's more efficient to read the data from there than to download it again.
ABI stability is huge and the Swift String interpolation seems quite promising as well!
Sweet. Thanks man!
Even with Swift 5, an external library/framework developed in and compiled with Swift 5 will not necessarily work in a future version of Swift without recompilation—that's the _module stability_ section in the link. The _ABI stability_ referred to is the stability of the Swift standard library—a current program can be compiled and dynamically linked to the Swift standard library and will function correctly when the standard library is upgraded.
&gt; Basically I have developed a framework with Swift4.2 and have created a fat version of framework. I currently distribute this framework with cocoapods as a compiled framework. However, it will create problem for Swift 5, because the app which uses swift 5 could not use library, written in Swift 4.2, correct? Correct. This is a use case that ABI stability in swift 5 aims to solve. If your framework and the host app both target Swift 5 or later, they should be compatible (so, an app compiled with Swift 6 would still be compatible with a framework compiled with Swift 5)
No worries, and yep that’s a great follow up example. Keep up the good work! Though it’s probably more advanced, if you happen to go further into memory management in relation to closures and capturing `self` weakly within those to avoid similar issues, I think that’d be helpful for people learning Swift also! Eg. // Hold self weakly similar to being a weak delegate of objectB objectB.handler = { [weak self] in self?.doSomething() } I found it funny that you avoided playgrounds, because I do too a lot of the time, even though I know they’re actually really powerful.
You must be implementing it incorrectly. If you set the frame of the ImageView and then set it to Aspect Fill, it will crop the top/bottom/left/right to ensure the image fits within the bounds. I would check your frame/constraints of the imageview. 
Easiest way is with three stack views. You can make those programmatically. Stack view #1(horizontal) : contains Top two buttons Stack view #2(horizontal): bottom two buttons Stack view #3(vertical): stack view #1 and #2 Then simply set your constraints on stack view #3 and everything else will be formatted nicely inside in the order you’re looking for. 
Okay cool. I'll take a look at doing it that way. Out of curiosity cause I'm leaning you say it's the easiest, is it also the most correct way of doing? Either way I'm going to use this method. 
Lol thanks for the feedback and I will definitely take your advice on if and when I further the lessons on men management. As for playgrounds - they seem to be as powerful as Siri ;) Speak soon! And again thanks for the help I really appreciate it.
There are a couple of ways to do that. As for making the buttons square, you can set the constraint on the aspect ratio of the button to be 1:1, or that width = height. You could place all of them into one UIView that acts as a container for them, and set restraints on each one so that it is in its intended position, e.g., the upper left button is constrained so that it is 0 pixels from the top, 0 pixels from the left side of its superview and with a width that is half of that of the superview. The other three would have similar restraints based on their position. The size of the UIView that contains the buttons would then be set by specifying its width. (At least I believe so; I can’t test it right now.) If you’re not working with other developers who prefer working by specifying restraints in code, I’d suggest trying it in the interface builder UI, as it will give you feedback as to when views’ restraints are over or under defined without having to compile and run in order to test. For large projects with multiple developers, however, it’s common to see restraints defined in code, as it’s easier to track changes in a .swift file than the XML of the interface builder file. 
Using stack views isn't a "shortcut" that loses performance in any way so I would say this is the correct way of doing it. So that stack views is for organizing your buttons together in the order you've stated. You will still need to make each button, customize it, and then add it to the stack view. Something like this would actually make each button `let button = UIButton(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 150, height: 50))` &amp;#x200B;
Okay cool. You guys are awesome. Another question. I have login and sign up in a stackview. In storyboard I know how to make the button print to console, programmatically, I am clueless. I can send a screenshot of one of my buttons in a little bit as I'm traveling and don't have internet without connecting to my phone.
Looks like a scrolling tab bar (this library might help: https://github.com/uias/Tabman) with pages containing tableviews with custom cells. Cells themselves have some shadows and curved corners that you should be able to do with shadow paths and other CALayer properties.
Obviously too much code is required to even get close to pulling off that layout, but to help guide you with some reading material you’re looking to write a custom collectionView flowLayout. [Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicollectionview/customizing_collection_view_layouts) to get you started. 
Are you sure? Swift 4.2 can use frameworks targeted for lower versions.
Not true. You can pull that off with a table view large cells and two UIViews per cell. One for each card. 
It isn't that difficult. Here is how you can approach it: \----------------- Create this hierarchy: * UIViewController * UITableView * UICollectionView (horizontal layout) as the tableView header for the scrolling pills * UITableViewCell (estimatedRowHeight: 300) \- UIView for the card on the left with a shadow + cornerRadius \- UIView for the card on the right with a shadow + cornerRadius * Remove the tableView.separator so you don't get lines in between the rows. * Disable cell highlighting so you don't get the grey on press Hope this helps!
Only if they were built with the same version of the compiler. i.e. Compiler 4.2.1 can build in Swift 4.2, 4.0, and 3 modes, but products built with it are not compatible with, say, the v4.0 compiler that can build in Swift 4.0 mode as well.
Thank you. :) 
Thank you :)
Thank you. Really appreciate :) will try it asap
You'll be able to build it in the Swift 4.2 mode of the Swift 5 compiler, but your previously built product won't be compatible with apps built with the 4.2 compiler, and vice versa.
Yup, just start section at a time. Good luck! &amp;#x200B;
How can I display a shapefile on a mapbox tile with Swift? Would I use WebView? I have shapefiles downloaded offline and a feature file, I want to be able to load it from local storage to my application without Wifi. Also, is it possible to view PDFs in a custom build iOS application?
I disagree, Material is nice and all but I feel like it belongs on Android. I find it looks nice and all but looks out of place in iOS
Forget to import certain modules?
There are a few popular ones like Carthage and Cocoapods. Being compiled isn't an issue as long as you aren't distributing binaries directly in the package manager. For example rust is a similar compiled language with a great package manager, and there are several (albeit none are amazing) for C++
Module format stability combined with ABI Stability would enable you as a binary framework and it would be supported from that point onwards till the lifetime of the language, although the language may continue to evolve but the new changes would not break the language and the changes would be additive.
Swift is used primarily for Cocoa Touch and Cocoa applications. Cocoa originates from decades ago so it has had plenty of new features added to it that’s built in. This means most apps don’t need to bring in too many third-party libraries because the OS provides so much functionality out of the box. For this reason I don’t think many good package managers have been built. 
If you delete those lines, does the rest of the project compile and run? Or do you start to get errors in other places where you're using FeedbackViewController?
Do you know where it’s from or if it was custom?
I believe it is custom from redbubble 
I believe it’s custom from red bubble
That is sweet!
How incredibly sweet! I'd be super flattered. I really like Red Bubble's pillows.
Looks very material, so I would look at some material Frameworks
What does "CGRect constraints" mean? &gt; hashButton1.frame = CGRect(...) It looks like these don't have constraints at all. You're just ignoring layout and trying to mess with the frame directly.
What makes them better? I find that pip is awful as soon as you stride off of the golden path. 
&gt; As development of Swift on Linux, **Windows**, and other platforms matures, the Swift Core Team will evaluate stabilizing the ABI on those platforms. It's finally comming !!
Hey, Scellow, just a quick heads-up: **comming** is actually spelled **coming**. You can remember it by **one m**. Have a nice day! ^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
Hey /u/CommonMisspellingBot, just a quick heads up: Your spelling hints are really shitty because they're all essentially "remember the fucking spelling of the fucking word". You're useless. Have a nice day! [^Save ^your ^breath, ^I'm ^a ^bot.](https://www.reddit.com/user/BooCMB/comments/9vnzpd/faq/)
Hey BooCMB, just a quick heads up: I learnt quite a lot from the bot. Though it's mnemonics are useless, and 'one lot' is it's most useful one, it's just here to help. This is like screaming at someone for trying to rescue kittens, because they annoyed you while doing that. (But really CMB get some quiality mnemonics) I do agree with your idea of holding reddit for hostage by spambots though, while it might be a bit ineffective. Have a nice day!
Those are the constrains — when creating the frame you are setting an X,Y origin inside of CGRect(), i.e., CGRect(x, y, width, height). The layout is part of the frame.
Gem? You mean bundler? I had problems with it on multiple occasions.
I know it sucks and horrible but still used a lot more than SPM :(
I know! I was happy when they gave it to me
&gt; I am aware of SPM but it is not something like the above package managers. How so?
Wish my uni had iOS courses 😭 
At my school there are courses in more practical CS (JS, Python, etc) but they are all student taught and run. There is just one prof who checks in with all the classes.
My Uni only teaches C++ for our CS degree which I will NEVER use considering I am getting into web development. 
Really? I guess I'm quite a bit behind... I haven't used it in a long time.
Thank you for the answer :) any suggestion about what framework ?
I seem to have an issue specific to the Mac OS Cocoa Application. (Sorry if that is the wrong name, I'm very new at swift) When I have a button that runs this code: let newURL = "https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/Potato" do { var content = try String(contentsOf:URL(string: newURL)!) print(content) } catch let error { // Error handling } The application will attempt to get the content, a json file in this case, and will come back with the error: "NSURLConnection finished with error - code -1003." I am pretty sure that this is an issue with the program being unable to resolve the name, but this code works in a blank playground and in a terminal application. Does anyone know if I am missing something super simple here?
An understanding of C++ will benefit you no matter what language you end up programming in
Sorry for intruding on this thread. But I would look at this for an iOS material framework. [https://github.com/material-components/material-components-ios](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-ios)
I am at the point where I understand how to put stuff together, but I am a mess with clean code and MVC. Can you recommend me some easy open source apps where I can learn how to structure a project?
Do you have screenshot of your layout (in storyboard)? We might able to diagnose what went wrong for your layout constraint if you show us the layout. I have written a series of post explaining how Auto Layout works here : https://fluffy.es/frame-vs-autolayout/ , hope this helps! I would recommend not using any library / stack views until you understand how auto layout constraint works. As for the linear function thing, each constraint you set is a function, and the iOS system will try to figure out the correct layout by satisfying all constraint / function. 
Thank you for the answer, I’m starting to get a bit more confident but sometimes things get way too confusing. I was testing Stack Views after I checked a tutorial online but even if they seem to actually help limiting the use of constraints I’m having a hard time setting up easier things. I’m also still trying to understand if it’s better to use Storyboards or just go the programmatic way. I think I’m just a bit overwhelmed as a newbie. I would love to hear what’s your preference, especially from a work environment point of view. 
I've add a new animation, hope you like it 👌
I’ve been working in iOS development and full stack web development since I graduated from my CS degree like four years ago, and in that time I’ve had very little reason to draw on my knowledge of C++. 
What kind of layout you are trying to achieve? I have used both storyboard / programmatic way during work (depends on my team lead preference), personally I like storyboard more as I can view the layout without needing to build and run on simulator. &amp;#x200B;
Make sure you don’t leave your apartment windows open, it looks Swift!
ATM its a stack of 3 elements, the app shows a joke every time you press a button: - At the top a label that shows a title. - A text View where the joke appears right in the middle - A button which when used shows the next joke at bottom I embedded all in a Vertical Stack View. But sometimes the Text in the text view doesn’t show. I think the problem is the text not adapting correctly to the layout of the page. In smaller screens sometimes it shows off but the text is literally waaaay too spaced.
You could get involved with swift compiler development.
That’s awesome!!! 
Good student :)
Doesn’t really interest me. My motivation is with web development mainly. 
&gt;All this time I regret using Swift for building a framework, because it creates lots of issues, many of which I did not understand up to today. Honestly how is this even possible? The community has been very upfront with this and even if that wasn’t the case the language is or was under very rapid development. Beyond all of that, even if all of these compatibility features existed today you would most rationally be updating your framework as new compiler technologies come out. Youcant live with 4.2 technology forever. I’m starting to wonder if you are a Python2 programmer. 
While not the whole trifecta this will be huge for many users. Honestly I’d like to see standard library stability on Linux before the release of Swift 5. It would certainly help with Swift adoption. 
Pointing out spelling and crammed error in the days of autocorrect just wastes every bodies time. iPhone has mangled my posts many times and frankly I don’t need to hear comments of any sort. If someone out there gets off on building useless bots havethem send the reports to Apple. Otherwise we are just experiencing wasted bandwidth. . 
I could update no problem. But it will still cause problems if my framework is written in swift 5 and app uses swift 4... My framework won't be usable, am I right?
Err no it means that it might come or might not. Support under Windows is worse than the Linux support at the moment. I would not hold my breath for timely Windows support. Frankly I wouldn’t do that for Linux and I really want to see Linux support. 
That’s an interesting point—the blog post only mentions standard library stability on Darwin platforms, not on Linux or others. I don’t see why it wouldn’t be achievable with Swift 5, but I don’t know the details.
I really don’t understand why this is of such a concern? Apps written in 4.2 will not exist for long. Is it that difficult to freeze the 4.2 version of your framework and move forward with the 5.x version? Frankly it is part of being responsible for a library. Very few ever make it to the point that no support coding is required. That includes feature requests, bug fixes and the like. Part of that includes adapting to refined compiler and library standards. 
You are more than a year late with this.
Most likely a Chicken or egg problem. That is people have to submit code to a package manager solution but there needs to be demand to make people submit. People don’t submit and thus there is no demand. Beyond that there are lots of other issues. Swift for one is an extremely young language and frankly still isn’t stable enough to entice library writers. I expect this to change in the future so maybe we will see more source code being contributed. Second; many of the primary developers using the language at the moment are greedy iOS developers. This results in a community that is disinclined to share code. Now not everyone is of this kind set but enough of the current developer mix is. Third; I really don’t buy into the greatness of some of the other package managers you reference like PIP. Think about it, pip can’t even update an installation properly. Fourth; there are far too many competeing ideas as to what a package manager should be and how it should work. There are at least 3 for Swift already and they all suck. Fifth; not enough people contribute to package manager code. Just imagine if SPM had as many people working on it as GIT for example. There are so many add one and pull requests for GIT that you can’t keep track of them all. SPM is rather developer poor in comparison. Sixth; lack of a sponsor! Personally one of the better ways to run a package manager in my opinion is to have all the code residing on one server. That requires investment by somebody but it does avoid one other uglies of alternative systems which is dead links and unresponsive remote servers. In this case a package manager is also a code repository. Many will argue that this is nonsense but I see it as the best avenue to success. Think of something like SourceForge that supports a package manager interface. One stop shopping for code, forums and documents. Seventh; I think I mentioned this earlier but Swift is extremely young. People seem to expect the infrastructure for 20 year old languages. This is really bad as Swift in reality will be about 2years old with the arrival of Swift 5. I say that in all seriousness as Swift and the library has morphed significantly from version one. SPM is likewise very young and frankly isn’t even considered finished from what I understand. In this context you can’t seriously expect Swift to be like the Python, TeX, or even the PERL communities. It just can’t evolve that fast. 
That's because it's been around a lot longer. 
This is a bit misleading. For one Swift is used for Mac apps. The primary reason it isn’t used more under Mac OS, Linux of others is that it isn’t ready for prime time on those platforms. In any event the standard library isn’t the problem just like it isn’t with Python. The problem is two fold in my mind. One is the simple lack of libraries for specific tasks. The other is simply finding the libraries if they even exist. An example here. I wrote some code in Python that I suddenly realized would be great to turn the results into a AutoCAD file. I found 2-3 libraries within minutes that could handle my simple needs. Try that with Swift at the moment no matter what platform yourself on. Often code discovery is as big of an issue as actuallygetting access to it through a package manager. This is where I see many package managers failing. I actually see a lot of need for third party code for Swift developers but I don’t see a good package manager solution that is modern and solve a lot of developer concerns. So there is a lack of interest or maybe incentive which combined with the strong “commercial” orientation of IOS developers has stunted package manager adoption and development. 
You like npm?
[removed]
Realm should be fine. Or core data. I don't like core data.
One way to do that would be to assign every struct entity a unique ID (say, \`UUID\`). That also makes it easy to serialize your model. Serialization of references can get tricky and the built-in \`Codable\` machinery doesn't help you there. &amp;#x200B; You can of course use classes instead--use the right tool for the job. there are no hard and fast rules to this stuff. &amp;#x200B; The reason they say "use structs" is so that all your model objects are values--which makes it easy to avoid mutating your data model except when intended. One way around that is to use classes, but make them immutable. I.e. Use readonly and \`let\` member vars.
Because it’s new
i traditionally use \`public private (set) var\` so its clear it only gets set in the class, not outside it; is this acceptable? &amp;#x200B; I think i'll stick with classes for now. 
Sure you can reference a struct, just wrap it: class Reference&lt;Value&gt; { let value: Value init(_ value: Value) { self.value = value } } Now if you can hold references to the struct and pass them around: struct Foo { let bar: Int } let referredFoo = Reference(Foo(bar: 5)) let secondReference = referredFoo Here's the thing, a struct really is best when you want safety. They are easier to make thread safe, they contribute less to bugs because they have copy semantics so they don't get modified under you as easily, and so on. Use a class when you need reference semantics and accessing and modifying the data in multiple places.
It's much easier to go from struct to class than the other way around. Make your model types as primitive as possible and then add the functionality you need through composition and extensions.
Did you force unwrap the present? 
There is also a UUID class that can generate unique IDs: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/uuid
And, of course, the gift had zero effect on the grade the student earned in the class. Right?
That's awesome..!! 
What? Are there few annotations about your goals? You just ONLY posted an image.
Implement the power series yourself inefficiently and call it a day
 let t = Double.pi/6 let x = sin(t) let y = cos(t) let p = asin(x) let q = acos(y) 
Of course not! They were one of my students last semester and gave it to me just this past week. 
[https://youtu.be/NY4kWZv9MKk](https://youtu.be/NY4kWZv9MKk) accident new to reddit!
You need `import Darwin` then you will have `sin`, `cos`, etc.
Be careful about mutating a referenced class--you may lose the benefits of immutability. Use \`let\` unless you have a good reason not to. Also, be sure to copy any instances out of our model when necessary. Good luck.
Yes, you can do something as simple as: &amp;#x200B; struct MyStruct { let uuid = UUID() ... } &amp;#x200B;
I expected recreating uitableviewcell from scratch. And it starts with implementation of the class. 
Sir you are a Saint 
The custom cell is created from scratch called “My CustomCell”. We create it by selecting “New File” thus ensuring it starts with no implementation. Let me know if you need some clarification! Happy to help - 
But your class inherits UITableViewCell. I believe sznowicki is saying he expected it to be built without doing that 
It's okay. Your videos seem impressive. I am a novice in Swift. But now I am learning about this language. Your videos might be helpful for me someday, so I subscribed your YouTube channel. Thank you for your videos!
Well imagine not only your Employee referring to their Employer but als each Employer referring to their Employees. That would be a circular reference with classes but structs just copy. So structs are safer at the cost of a bit of memory. Structs are the best choice for data that has a reasonably short life to be replaced when they change. If you have data that lingers around independently of let’s say a viewcontroller like a cache of core data then objects are a better choice. You want to hold a reference to an object after you save it to disk or when another viewcontroller updated it. So forget about the whole VIPER thing for a second and think why you want your data to be around for such a long time. If you’re really just talking about one “flow” worth of data most probably you are making some kind of mistake in your approach. If these objects are cached and re-used among multiple really separate flows like in a cache then objects might really be the answer.
Ya I am trying to figure out what sznowicki was saying... The class must inherit from UITableViewCell in order to be a cell in a tableView. That is what building it from scratch means :) Sorry for any confusion! 
If you have videos or a series of videos you would like me to make :) please suggest! Thanks for subscribing!
I think all floating point types have a representation of pi 
Inheriring from UITableViewCell means you take it and modify it. Building from scratch means we take nothing and „Build it from scratch“. Anyway... nice Tutorial :) 
It sound ridiculous to me. You would have to create a custom scroll view with table view like methods. So basically you end up in the same place. Also UITableViewCell has some preset styles, which when not used means it's a custom cell.
Just want to say that I’m taking a class that mimics real world work and we use these almost every day. They are extremely important and can really make your app “pop” visually. 
Why in the world would you have expected that?
I don’t know. Maybe it’s because it was early morning. Maybe just because when I see “custom” i don’t expect just an implementation of a default class. But I admit that’s my bad. You guys are right. For table cell the title makes sense. 
Not really. That would be a nice tutorial to show how sophisticated table view is in uikit. It’s not just simple scroll view. Would scroll view be able to render million rows without crashing? I doubt. The reasons uitableview and related classes are as they are is in some cases memory optimization. It would be awesome read/watch to see how it could be build without uikit at all. Just shapes and texts. 
Darwin is where you can find all of the [ANSI C Standard Library](http://www.csse.uwa.edu.au/programming/ansic-library.html).
Setting the frame of something will just tell iOS to draw it inside a certain rectangle, but that's not a layout. Constraints are needed to tell iOS how to position a view in relation to other views. Constraints are part of AutoLayout, which is a system that handles setting frames for you so that you don't have to worry about coordinates -- you just tell AutoLayout the constraints, and it figures out where to put everything.
Contructive critiscm coming your way here: * You should teach your viewers to dequeue reusable `UITableViewCells` and not overriding the `initWithStyle:(UITableViewCellStyle)style reuseIdentifier:(nullable NSString *)reuseIdentifier` method. By using these `UITableView` methods: * `register(_ cellClass: AnyClass?, forCellReuseIdentifier identifier: String)` * `register(_ nib: UINib?, forCellReuseIdentifier identifier: String)` * You should create ViewModel structs or a static method on your custom `UITableViewCell` for the cell height and not relying on hardcoded values that needs to be changed in multiple places. * This video showcased an example of using the same custom `UITableViewCell` for all cells in the `TableView`. Your implementation of `tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -&gt; UITableViewCell` is misleading if you want to add another custom cell.
Appreciate all the feedback here guys! Nobody is right or wrong - there are many ways to do things in iOS and everyone is at different levels of experience. I’m trying my best to make videos that please novice to early intermediates. Some novices know MVVM and some intermediates don’t full understand how MVC even works. So it’s a delicate balance of what to talk about / why etc. I’m learning as a content creator. Thanks for all the tips - I’ll use each one in my next videos. Best
Is it possible to learn this power?
What do you mean? 
First thing to do is check the application bundle to see if the files are present inside. If you have an .ipa file, change the suffix to .zip, double-click on it to unzip it, and then check the contents. If you're running within the simulator, you can \`print(Bundle.main.path)\` and then open the path in the Finder or Terminal. Next thing to check is be sure that the string has the same case as the filename. The simulator is not case sensitive but the device file system is. 
Thanks
My specific example is a Game A game has many decks A deck contains many cards A card can be owned by 0 or 1 player only &amp;#x200B; The deck has a one to many relationship to a card The card has a reference to a parent deck (Weak) The things that change are: The owner and some other things which aren't relevant &amp;#x200B; In this case, most of the data is a let. Except the owner which is a class reference to a player. &amp;#x200B; To achieve this referencing I use classes and \`public private var\` or lets where possible. &amp;#x200B; But now I'm thinking should have just used structs. &amp;#x200B; I find the conversation confusing, I would much prefer to use my classes, make the changes and not lose references &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
The reason I need them around is because the state of the game may change the owners of cards or other state of card (whether its available for purchase) &amp;#x200B; I also pass references of objects from one view controller to another
Make sure the file you’re looking for has been added to your project in Xcode either by dragging it into the project window or right clicking and adding files. Just because it is in your projects root directory doesn’t mean it will be bundled with the app.
spritekit would work well
SpriteKit would definitely work for that. If you wanted a 3D perspective view, SceneKit would be better. [Here's a SpriteKit tutorial.](https://www.raywenderlich.com/71-spritekit-tutorial-for-beginners)
It's not an iOS project tho, it's a macOS application. Does it change something? I tried printing the main bundle path (with Bundle.main.bundlePath since it couldn't find the path property, only the methods) and indeed my files aren't there. So I guess I didn't add them correctly?
I did actually add my files with by right-clicking on a folder in my project directory and choosing the add files option. I also checked the "Copy items if needed" and "Add to target" options but still it doesn't work :/
Oh jeez, i didn’t even read that you are doing a console app, sorry about that. You can’t bundle resource like that with a console app, at least not to my knowledge. I believe you’ll have to specify that as an input to your app. 
No worries! Hmm that would explain why it doesn't work! So would I have to put the full path to the file I need?
Yup, just take the file path as an argument.
That’s what it sounds like to me. You should use Finder or a terminal to look around in the application package. Start at the pay that’s given for Bundle.main.bundlePath and see where your CSV file ended up if anywhere. Then if you see it somewhere you didn’t expect you can check the copy files phase and see why it wasn’t where you expected. 
Thanks everyone for the advice. Done lots of reading and playgrounds this week and finally pulling a project together! 
Never mind... I didn't realize that apple sandboxed apps automatically. All I had to do was enable network access in the sandbox settings
Then the file doesn't exist. 
&gt; It's not an iOS project tho, it's a macOS application. Does it change something? Yes.
&gt; You can’t bundle resource like that resources*
Hey you were right! I was finally able to load the CSV file. I had some difficulties because I choosed the wrong encoding type for my file (it was isoLatin1 instead of utf8) and it worked! Thanks a lot :)

Awesome!
100k of VTHO is around 31$ :) what a shame for the VeChain supporting development is such a way
I hope I am not late to this thread. I am learning Swift via "App Development with Swift" by Apple and I got to the lesson about closures. While I understand how they work I got confused by this "quiz" at the end of the lesson: https://imgur.com/a/xWSppBP Shouldn't right answer be "A. Function"? Functions always start with "func" while closures start with "var/let"?

Reduce it to a couple of lines which still show your issue
&gt; Those are the constraints No, it's not. It's just a rectangle. &gt; The layout is part of the frame. That sentence makes no sense at all.
What does "use them" mean? Pip and Node, without a requirements file, install in /usr/local (for the current active environment -- which can itself be problematic). What would you want SPM to do in this case? There's no global dumping ground for third-party Swift libraries. You can't just set $SWIFTPATH to a folder with a framework and run a Swift program. Most other package managers I've used for compiled languages (like Carthage, Leiningen, etc.) don't work that way, either.
Delete the app, reinstall.

That's probably because apps can't set the phone's wallpaper images.
So would I basically be cresting a photo gallery, the user saves it to their phone, and then they can set the wallpaper on their end?
I believe you can just call share controller and users will be able to set the image as wallpaper from it.
If you have no background, I recommend Angela Yu on Udemy. If you have background, the Stanford course on ITunes is a good starting point.
Start writing your own app is the best way to learn coding. 
This. Nothing has worked for me as well as a hands on approach. 
Up vote for Angela Yu, my only issue is I have been stuck on a problem and haven't got a response for weeks. Other than that I have learned a good amount and I am currently venturing out and building my own app with knowledge I learned from her.

You can try out 100DaysOfSwift [https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100). It's geared to help learn and improve swift skills. It also comes with tutorials and tests. Plus, it's free You can also download the swift book from the Apple Books Store or go to [swift.org](https://swift.org) to read and know everything about the swift programming language. As for me, I use the book for learning and reference, and the 100DaysOfSwift for testing my knowledge 
I used \`@dynamicMemberLookup\`, \`@dynamicCallable\`. 
That’s what I call custom cell https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/aoz4l4/comment/eg57372?st=JRZBATZM&amp;sh=8bdade92
What’s the problem? Feel I might be able to help. Feel free to dm
I believe it has to do with something related to caching your images, so you don't have to re-render them once you already rendered them once. Are you retrieving your images through a network call? 
Derek banana YouTube or YouTube tutorials in general. If you understand the fundamentals of coding you can go to the swift website and look over the documentation. iOS developement uses uikit which is a library. It’s good to know how it works to make applications. There is also SpriteKit and SceneKit for games if that’s what your into.
I don't see what you're referring to in your video. However, collection view cells are reused as needed. If you have 1,000 items that can be shown in your collection view, you won't have 1,000 items ever loaded into memory. You'll have a small handful of cells loaded with data for things that are currently viewable in memory (plus generally a few things that are no longer displayed on screen, but were very recently). You just need to make sure to fill out the cell completely when the collection view asks you for a cell for a certain item, because when you dequeue a cell for reuse, it will typically have data in it from an item you previously populated it with (before you scrolled that other item off the screen).
I am referring to how it looks when I scroll back up for example, the text suddenly going all weird. Have a rewatch and see if you can see what I’m talking about.
I watched it for several loops and it didn't stand out to me. Maybe just because I'm not able to notice it before it scrolls off again. What is "going weird" about it?
Keep your eyes on the “Chinese video...” article. Watch the difference between the text on the scroll down compared to how it looks when I’m scrolling back up.
&gt; loosing the data losing* the data 
it looks like when you scroll back up the cell is being reused after showing a larger title. When you set the contents of the text you might need to invalidate any existing layouts, or maybe do it in cell reuse Or possibly it’s an issue with cell height calculation, are you using self sizing cells?
realm.io 
No I’m not using self sizing haven’t worked out how to do that yet 😅😅
Just use SDWebImage
I agree with this. There's some side effect from putting text that needs to wrap differently in the caption under the photo. It seems to be shortening the width of the label to match the current needs of the data being displayed, thus causing problems later on when the cell is reused.
Check your constraints. Maybe something there is causing the label width to change.
try calling invalidateLayout after updating text 
The user has to manually set the image as a wallpaper from the Photos app (check out the Zedge app)
It’s a little too hard to tell exactly what the culprit is without seeing some code in the collection view delegate methods. My guess is not using prepareForReuse properly, or that you are making service calls in cellForItemAt, and the image calls are being made again when the cells come back on screen. Definitely could be related to caching images like someone else said, but it could be a few different things working incorrectly here. 
I don’t think this is possible with standard NSMenuItems. You might be able to do it with an NSView-based menu item, but that’s a lot of extra pain… May I ask why you want to display attributed text in the tooltip?
Here, this site has a lot of information for people like you: r/autism
TinyConstraints[TinyConstraints](https://github.com/roberthein/TinyConstraints is a great library https://github.com/roberthein/) That’s what we use current at my job. It’s easy to use, have tons of examples and are always up to date.
I've done something similar and just used a simple collection view. However my grid I needed was just 32 x 32, so maybe if your looking to make something larger it will not work? It's hard to say other than that.
8 million VET for first place is a lot more - not sure am following what you mean ? :)
Where should I call the images?
Take a look at the pod “kingfisher” had this problem when i first started working. With network calls and tableViews. Handles all the image caching for you!
I use kingfisher already 
Are you using frames or constraints for the layout?
Constraints why?
A xib file might work for your purposes, here.
To annoy people with finely tuned accessibility settings who expect standard controls to behave in a standard way, I imagine. ;-)
wait what is this javascript supposed to do? 
Evaluate the expressions so I can get the HTML with the tracking details
but like it seems like you just get a string an then do nothing with it? I'm not big on javascript so I don't know if there is anything missing, but how would you know whether or not this script is executed?
This currently returns the full HTML with tracking details if I create a break point and then resume it. If I don’t create a breakpoint, it returns everything everything before second JS cycle. It works for other webpages that evaluate JS but the page I’m trying to parse loads most the html and then starts one JS expression before starting the second one and the second JS cycle is when the data I need is returned. I’m a beginner in JS so if what I said doesn’t make sense, I can try to explain it better.
Looks like you have a button that calls playAct() which starts play and prints average and peak power just once. You'll need to do this repeatedly in some sort of timer. I guess they're both low at first. Also, I think you need to call [updateMeters](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avaudioplayer/1388565-updatemeters)() before they'll have values in them. You're making us do a lot of work to answer your question. Try to pair it right back.
I’m looking at the video, and it looks like when the cell is reused and the title label line count changes, the constrain gets broken and displays improperly. Maybe mess with the prepareForReuse() method? YourLabel.numberOfLines should be set to 0, double check that too
Your first mistake is using Alamofire
This isn’t likely to work—you’ll end up invalidating the layout of the whole collection view every time you set the contents of the cell.
Have you tried calling setNeedsLayout() and then layoutIfNeeded() within the cell before returning it in cellForReuse(atIndexPath:)? Also consider truncating the tail of your title label to keep it at 2 lines and constant cell height.
Thanks for the encouragement to migrate... Native or some other cocopod?
You can never grow as a developer if you keep relying on third parties. In fact, with recent changes to swift and iOS, you’ll want to start phasing out cocoa pods altogether 
Thanks for the suggestion! I'm guessing that will work, but I'll have to see how much overhead a big collection view will have. Especially since I'll expect the user to quickly update the grid (it will actually be a 2D slice of 3D data). However it definitely may be an option!
Ok. So I’m not 100% sure it’s exactly what I’m about to explain but It’s something along these lines. Also this post is only referring to the title text issue. I didn’t see another one but I didn’t reallly look long. What’s happening is the label being reused in the cell is still using one of the frames of a resized cell that had a smaller width label. I say width specifically because even if a label had more text it’s width might be smaller if auto layout Wrapped the long words to anotj r line. This is why it happens on the scroll back up but not the beginning. The label gets resized for text then scrolled away then reused for a differed title where the formatting is now screwed up. So it’s easiest to illustrate the problem in the “mum of four..” cell. “Mom of four in Hungary pays no tax” has greater width than “Mom of four in Hungary Pays no tax” Therefore when the above text is filling a label that’s been autoresized (with a smaller width) the text now wraps in a different way. A quirk of the autofit label thing is that it will reduce the width of the label once it wraps the text, unless you constrain it otherwise. Set a background color of bright red or something on the title label and you’ll see what I mean. Couple solutions I can think of: -The people suggesting layoutifneeded are correct but it depends on the way you’ve done your constraints -try anchoring the leading and trailing edges of the label to be a fixed margin from the sides of the cell. That should make it so resizing only accounts for vertical height but it depends on your other constraints -change the truncating methods or truncate text Regardless of the solution this boils down to constraint issues with cell reuse. Keep this in mind when you’re tinkering.
So what's the problem? Issues with `Codable` should produce an `Error` value that you can print using `response.result.error`, which should let you see what's wrong. Also, `if response.result.error == nil &amp;&amp; response.result.value != nil` is pointless. `response.result` is a `Result` value, which can only be success or failure, and so will always produce a value or an error, never neither or both. It's also an enum, so you can switch on it, or use its API to transform it.
https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart read from firestore and set your labels text from there!
Have a look at [twelve.app](https://twelve.app) :)
The way you get the data is in some snapshot that has an attached event listener. There can be one tree of entries that can be parsed into each respective label. 
Are you setting your images in `tableView(_:cellForRowAt:)` or `tableView(_:will Display CellAt:)`? I believe the latter should resolve the image reuse issue if these images are synchronously loaded. 
Your auto layout constraints are wrong i suppose. There’s no magic in it, just fix your constraints.
Why are you posting this here? Did you write the app in swift? If so you should share a little about your experience rather than blatantly self-promoting. 
Make sure that in the cell for item method you assign / re-assign all information to the cell's components. Bare in mind that the cell at a given position (IndexPath), previously was at a different position (re-use mechanism) and contains incorrect information, so you have to re-assign everything. 
I’ve had issues with multiline labels in collection view cells in the past. Try setting the label’s preferredLayoutMaxWidth to the label’s bounds.width in layoutSubviews https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uilabel/1620534-preferredmaxlayoutwidth 
The Apple Books in iBooks are pretty great. App Development with Swift if you're experienced. Intro to App Development with Swift if you're new to programming.
Figure it out on your own. You don’t need a tutorial for every app you build. If you get lost, ask specific questions. 
Got it!
this is absolutely the issue. I've experienced the same thing. Do this: Instead of re-downloading your image every time the cell comes into view, only download it the first time, and then store it in \`UserDefaults\` or an \`NSDictionary\` at the key of whatever the image is called. Then on each cell do this: \`if let image = self.imageDict\["key"\] { cell.image = UIImage(image) }else{ // download your image from the server // Cache it in your dictionary at the key of whatever you used to d/l it }\` &amp;#x200B; This kind of evaluation in \`cellForRowAtIndexPath\` will keep your cells from loading from remote storage every time. 
Very clever. Good work.
Thanks! It's one of my first blog posts so let me know if you have any feedback :)
What I often do is to leave the game state as a separate entity from my UI. So the user triggers an action trough the UI, that action gets passed to the State and the State generates a model for the UI to display. Since the model for the UI to display will change every time depending on the state after each of the moves it's easy to re-generate this model for the view every time as an immutable struct. So instead of passing your permanent state objects to the UI where you're very tempted to mess directly with them you should place them behind some kind of Game interface that only accepts certain commands like makeMove or something. Then: * Check if the move is valid * If so change the state in the object tree * Give all listeners a new model for the view This makes your UI a passive listener for changes in the model, which will be reflected by a static representation of that model specifically tailored for that view. It makes a lot of somewhat hard things much easier like a remote player making a move. So your holy "this is the truth about the game" state is permanent and exists of objects, but isn't touched directly by the layers belonging to or close to the UI. It's firewalled by your logic layer, nothing goes to the state or objects belonging to it directly but it needs to pass through the logic layer. The UI gets an immutable struct containing only what it needs to have without getting tempted to mess with it directly. https://www.toptal.com/swift/static-patterns-swift-mvvm-tutorial
Hi. Don't know if this is the right forum but: If someone with full access to my iPhone installed a spyware with full system privileges &amp; I Erased All then did a factory restore, will using my iCloud account and a backup done whilst compromised reinstall the software? Thank you
I am setting my images in: tableView(_:cellForRowAt:) 
A few comments - by extending your ViewController to conform to your protocol, you’re violating the single responsibility protocol. That is the kind of code that leads to massiveVC. Your view controller should not be making decisions like that. You have a 12 line function for a view controller with only 2 UI elements. Think about how quickly that will grow with more UI elements or 3+ themes. - many apps now support a light, dark, and black theme. If your convenience code breaks after 2 themes, and you down the road want to implement a third theme, you’re wasting a lot of time refactoring everything just for the sake of convenience. Extending your solution to work with 3+ cases would be a good exercise. - you created `Theme: CaseIterable` but did not make note of why it’s a CaseIterable until “Additional Improvements”. I would recommend keeping it to just `Theme` until CaseIterable is actually required. 
Interesting! Made me have some ideas for improvements, but this is a cool approach!
Hi sorry for the noob question, but do I need to first fork the repository and THEN clone it to work on it?
- I’m actually interested in this; how would you implement this? I mean, in my app I support the protocol on individual view subclasses, not only the view controllers, but the view controllers are still in charge of stuff like their background color. - I agree! However, I wanted to keep this article short and sweet, and the convenience toggle code is just something I saw on Paul Hudson’s site. - Fair enough, I’ll fix that later (I’m on mobile right now) Thanks for the detailed feedback!
Happy to hear you liked it! I’d prefer not to majorly change the article now that it’s published but I’d still love to hear if you had any specific suggestions in mind?
If you plan on submitting changes, yes!
Not the other commenter, but I want to share some stuff with you. It’s a good article with a good idea. First, it’s not too bad re: SRP if MVP or other similar architectures are employed. You can also put the themeDidChange into extensions for code organization. Now, I do see a couple functional problems. 1. This doesn’t really cover built-in UIViewControllers (UIAlertViewController, MFMessageComposerViewController, etc). 2. Each place is manually observing a global theme. We did something like this at work. What we chose to do is something more akin to the tintColor pattern, since I assume when Apple adds this API, it’ll look like that. But how do you bootstrap it? Well, you either swizzle or use UIAppearanceProxy on a custom category property on your top level elements, so any allocated of that type (say UIWindow) are given the theme immediately and able to register as observers. The core UIResponder subclassss all have extensions to iterate subviews, etc.
Thanks for the comments! Unfortunately, built in view controllers can only be themed via very hacky ways. While I may do this in an app, obviously checking the iOS version, I’d prefer not to put it in a public blog post that may be followed by tons of people. That’s also an interesting technique — but I do prefer to avoid using methods such as those which might break in the future 🤔 
It’s a bit different use case, to be fair. We pass all the theme colors and fonts; not just a light/dark bool. So in the case of the stock view controllers, changing the navigation bar’s tint or font isn’t a problem. Neither of the methods I mentioned should break in the near future. I’ve done enough stupid things over the years to know. 😂 The cool thing about using UIResponder is that you can change what gets passed to your children, if you like. Another idea we tossed around was riding on the back of UITraitCollection.
Sure! The improvements I was thinking about were about the colors. I would create an extension of **UIColor** and set the theme color there. So when the theme changes, we would update the theme color (one option would be setting a global var with the theme, changing it and them notifying the change for the theme color) and them notify the UIViews to update, without telling them which color would be the new one, since they will get the color from te variable we just updated. &amp;#x200B; So, the major change would be moving the **switch-case** to the **UIColor** extension, and we would be able to access this color from any other class (when loading a new **ViewController**, for example, which could set it's color by just calling something like **UIColor.themeColor()**). &amp;#x200B;
Thanks! I hope to do some changes :D Is it okay if I ask some more noob questions regarding github? So if I plan to work on an issue, should I mark it somewhere that I'm working on that issue so that others can help me out?
Yah, you can comment on an issue to discuss working on it. Also, feel free to open new issues for anything you want to implement
I actually preferred learning from Matt Neuberg: 1. iOS Swift fundamentals 2. Programming iOS 12 Are exceptional books to start with. 
I came up with a theming system very similar to /u/Jaspergreenham's, but instead of a Theme enum, I made it a struct with properties for all the colors and styles for that theme. Then in my themeDidChange method implemented on each view controller I use the theme's color properties there. The annoying thing about what you mentioned is that not everything I want to theme works with UIAppearance.
Why did you create your own Observation struct instead of just using NotificationCenter? It was made for this.
&gt; I did research on host application and came to know that it is must to set for application tests. You don't need to set host application for the test target. But not setting it is only useful for macOS ui testing on older OS versions that can't run the most recent Xcode, so they need to build the test target separately, copy the older xcode test build products next to the built app and then run the tests from derived data. This way you won't build the app with older xcode, so you only need ifelse for swift version in your ui test runner.
What do you mean by “everything you want to theme”? Are you referring to attributes or to views/view controllers? I don’t seem a limit on either. The appearance proxy works on custom properties. So you just make a category property on UIView called “theme”... and you can open it up and abuse it further, for example, if you just want to get a reference to every view created to set the theme on them.
Maybe I’m misremembering. I should look back at my code.
I probably wasn’t clear in what I was describing above because I’m used to looking at these problems in a different way. When there are developers you don’t even know, who aren’t under the same management with same priorities, working on your app, you come up with clever ways to make things easy to do right and difficult to do wrong. So, what I was trying to say is: if you want to be able to set your theme without tracking every view explicitly and requiring them to opt-in, you have limited options to deliver theming to all the UI elements. The goal is to have a hook like tintColorDidChange- themeDidChange. Why? Because I predict that’s how it would be done by Apple, so migration will be easier if they eventually introduce an API. The options for implementing this are: swizzling didMoveToWindow, creative hijinks with UIAppearance proxies (not the way most people understand or use them), pass theme on UITraitCollection. I think that’s about it.
I never even have build failures, because I'm cool.
&gt; I did research on host application and came to know that it is must to set for application tests. It is possible to move almost all app code into a framework and then test it without having a host app. The only problem I had is that calling UIApplication.shared simply crashed. That was fixed by using a protocol so I could inject fake UIApplication during tests. The benefit was quicker test runs, and it also became possible to use that framework in a playground.
Rx community already did work for you )) https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxTheme 
I know you're trying to be funny but this doesn't help OP at all... 
Can you post some more your code? It's hard for me to determine what's going on here.
According to the first piece of ...var subnets, the answer is right there, in the completion handler, you're returning a Subnet object, instead of what's expected which is a \[Subnet\] array. &amp;#x200B; You're returning an object, instead of an array, hence the reason why you're able to get the arrays inside the object. What exactly are you trying to do? Change that var subnets = \[Subnets\] to var subnets: Subnets? and you're good.
I'm genuinely excited to see this finally coming after remembering the previous years of "maybe next year". Just listened to the most recent Swift Community episode and it is very interesting to hear how Swift 5 really put things together for ABI Stability. The amount of times I've had to explain, to those who never touched Swift, that Swift apps are generally larger than equivalent Obj-C apps due to runtime bundling, despite being a 1st party language, are hopefully over.
I think I'm good... I actually thought I was not returning an object which was freaking me out. Thank you!!
 override func loadView() { view = MyRootView() } self.backgroundColor = Theme.current.backgroundColor
What's the reasoning behind using struct for something that only has get only properties and also instantiating it every time the ThemeProvider's associatedObject is accessed?
Exactly. Why the obsession with “pure swift”? Cocoa Touch has a tons of stuff that you should be leveraging, instead of reinventing the wheel. 
Filled out your survey, best of luck with your paper.
Im having trouble decoding nested dictionaries. The item I want to access is a list of dictionaries, and I cannot seem to build the structure correctly to do so. The json looks like this, and I want to access "games" and print "gameId". &amp;#x200B; `games = ({gameId: 0025698, homeTeam:{name: "String", score: 20}, awayTeam: {name: "String", score: 25}}, {gameId: .........` My attempt to print out each gameId looks like this, but prints nothing: `struct Scores: Decodable {` `let games: Games }` `Struct Games: Decodable {` `let gameId: Int }` &amp;#x200B; `do {` `let scores = try JSONDecoder().decode([Scores].self, from: data)` `for score in scores {` `print(score.games.gameId)` `}` `} catch {}` &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Hey again! Just trying to get this working again, would you mind taking a look at the code I added to the post? I tried using your method, and at the moment, the screen is just unresponsive. Any thoughts?
There are so many ways of doing it. A) you can simply extend texview with extension of the operation and just make it enum with what action to perform. B) you can also define one action and just assign tag for each action and use switch on them to use enum operation and call update. C) can monitor using KVc when texview changes and update view. 
You can use GYB. It is what Apple uses in their code and I find it really useful. Refer to [this awesome tutorial](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi7tuGt7LTgAhUxn-AKHXDgCqEQFjAAegQICRAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnshipster.com%2Fswift-gyb%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Uuijc210jqvMYZVJMty3y) to learn about it.
The 'self' you are referencing in the UITapGestureRecognizer is not referencing the instance, but rather is referencing the type itself. So, your messages are being sent to the 'ViewController' type object not your instance of ViewController. Instead, define it as: var tapRecognizer: UITapGestureRecognizer! and initialize it elsewhere. For example: func tapToCancelReady() { tapRecognizer = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(tapToCancel)) resultsBackgroundView.addGestureRecognizer(tapRecognizer) resultsView.isUserInteractionEnabled = false resultsLabel.isUserInteractionEnabled = false } 
Also, unless you are doing something fancy elsewhere, you don't need to make your view controller a UIGestureRecognizerDelegate nor assign it: tapRecognizer.delegate = self.
Classes are *always* useful. Apps literally run in classes. Can you imagine listing variables for every single thing you want to make? Maybe you can imagine that because you’re used to someone else making the classes: let label = UILabel() To you, that looks like ‘setting a variable’ but really, it’s a class. The only true primitive types are integers, booleans, characters, floats, doubles, etc. (Unique but similar for every language). Everything else is a class e.g. a wrapper for primitive types. Likewise, UILabel contains characters wrapped in Strings, floats wrapped in Points and Frames, integers wrapped in colors, and a handy set of built in functions to display the values. Can you imagine having to do that from scratch? That’s inefficient, hence we use classes. Furthermore, there is another common class: UIView. It has a lot of similarities with a UILabel. It would be pointless for the makers of UIKit to completely rebuild all the same details of a UIView but with text. Therefore UILabel inherits from UIView. Meaning, UILabel is a subclass of UIView, inheriting all the goodies that come with it, while expanding the features. And UIView is the superclass of UILabel, meaning that a UILabel can always also act as a UIView. This is a tiny snapshot into the world of polymorphism and object-oriented programming. Other important players in the game of polymorphism are Extensions and Protocols - great features of classes. TL;DR: if you don’t want all these great benefits, learn a scripting language.
It sure made using a 3rd party framework a big gamble if you planned on supporting your app.
Thank you for the response! &amp;#x200B; As soon as I posted this, someone explained the importance of "init". It's creating an object, I get that part now. &amp;#x200B; So basically what you're saying is a class is a really useful way to access all of its components? Let's say we had a class for a car, with propertiers about its color, size, and weight. &amp;#x200B; class Car { var color = blue var size = 4 var weight = 100 } What's the advantage of doing that as opposed to just listing them without having them in the Car class and accessing them that way. &amp;#x200B;
Also, do you have any resources to understand the "dot" notation used in classes? That has me confused as well.
Right now your class is simple, so it would be okay to list them. But imagine if you had 400 cars in your simulation. How could you search through all your cars to find the average weight of red cars? By just listing 1200 vars, I don’t think it’ll be very clean, but with classes, you could, for example, add all your cars to an array, and iterate through them to find the average weight.
Not sure of resources. You should research about OOP and Polymorphism. Those concepts aren’t tied to only Swift, it will help you in any OO language. As far as dot notation, I assume you mean the ‘dot’ between an instance and an instance variable? Like using your Car example: var truck = Car() truck.color = red truck.weight = 10 truck.size = 21 var van = Car() van.color = white // etc... This accesses the properties of an instance. So your truck and van are instances of the same class. They are both cars, but they have different values.
&gt; The only true primitive types are integers, booleans, characters, floats, doubles, etc. That's not true for Swift. All of those are `structs`, not primitives. See [`Int`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/int)'s declaration: struct Int Now the lines between a struct and a primitive are pretty blurred in Swift. Basically it's not useful to talk about primitives in Swift, there are 3 types of objects: `struct`, `class`, and `enum`. There are no primitives, each type has its own complexities.
So does it print what you expect in both scenarios, or not?
It doesn't print anything. For some reason the function isn't even called in the viewDidLoad once I add the rest of the code.
Yes that’s all true. Main point for the mod is that objects encapsulate properties and methods.
I won’t believe that it’s not called until you add more print statements in there. Such as in an else condition on your if let purchased... attempt. Seems like the obvious thing that’s happening is it’s failing because the key doesn’t exist (or possibly does but its value is of the wrong type) and so it’s doing nothing as a result.
Check my recent edit. This is from my other app and it works just fine. I checked the keys and they both match.
Found the not cool one
Can you humor me and add it in? Because you’re not accounting for that scenario in your debugging output.
This means that if they released any big swift features like a concurrency model in swift, your app would have to cancel support for iOS versions preceding that version. So it’s like not being able to support new api features of a new os, except that you can use new swift features 
I added the else statement and still nothing. I updated the image for you above.
Oh wait I'm sorry it did call the print statement.
Oh my god, thank you so much!! I really appreciate it, and I have much to learn about the self!
You can assign all of your menu items to the same action and use the tag to decide what to wrap your strings with: static let textWrap = ["**", "_", "~~", "`"] @IBAction func format(sender: NSMenuItem) { textView.replace(left: textWrap[sender.tag], right: textWrap[sender.tag]) }
&gt;I get what Classes vs Objects vs Instances are (The blueprint, the actual thing you're building, and instances of that thing you've belt), but why couldn't you just place all of the class's properties in regular variables (i.e not in a class). To be blunt: You don't understand the differences. I don't even think that you understand one of these concepts properly. I'd recommend reading up on Object Oriented Programming Re init(): When you want to use an instance of a class (i.e. an object) you call the class's initializer (the init() method) which then returns the object.
The edit demonstrates that that if else statement works just fine in another project. But the one above does not.
Not really sure what you are saying here. But you can't prove that that code works in another project, because each app has its own UserDefaults. Also, you need to make sure to cover the scenario where the key is not found in UserDefaults, or the value for the key is not of the expected type. Otherwise your code is unpredictable.
I'm sorry I am so confused. I updated the 2nd screenshot to show you how I set the "Purchased" key. The payment process works fine. I am relatively new to all of this.
I’ve noticed weird behavior with testing view controllers this way though. Dismisses don’t seem to work for example, even if you’re displaying on another view controller. Button taps also can be flaky. Extremely interested if anyone has ways to fix this.
OK. So an issue that is still evident is that you are never setting Purchased to false, only to true once they make the purchase. Which is totally fine! What's not fine is that your code that checks whether or not Purchased is set to true assumes that: 1) There is a key in UserDefaults named "Purchased" 2) The value for that key is either true or false (vs. a number, a string, or whatever) So that's why I was saying that you need to handle the case where your "if let purchased..." call fails. Because until the user makes the purchase, it will fail, as there is no "Purchased" key in UserDefaults until then, so checking it returns nil. Hope that makes sense now.
I suggest downloading App Development with Swift on iBooks if you haven't done it.

Whether or not to use static functions for certain tasks is an interesting convo but that wouldn’t be the issue here. If you call that function in a view controller and then call self.view in the closure you will be creating a strong reference cycle and never actually deallocate the view controller. You would want to declare [weak self] and then perform an explicit check that self is not nil. 
So does it mean that the view controller is not deallocated even after it is dismissed? And then deallocated after the closure block is finished?
How does this affect Swift on Linux?
At least for the time being, Swift on Linux is completely untied to the platform. It's up to you to link against the Swift runtime that you want to use (or up to your users to install the Swift runtime that they need).
IMO, the concerns over not being able to use things are exaggerated. A lot of new language features won't need much ABI support, or can be provided by shims. The Objective-C runtime has been part of the OS forever and that hasn't really bugged off anyone.
If your closure retains the view controller, yes
Thankss! Swift makes too much sense. Greatest lang ever. 
So for instance if I build a project using SPM on Linux for Swift 5, it will still produce a working binary, or will there be additional steps required to link the runtime?
Those are some nice ideas! In my personal apps I am using computed properties for theme colors but I didn't think to include that in the post, and yeah, that might clean up the code more.
I don't like the NotificationCenter API but that's just me :)
If it's own your own machine, that should always work. Distributing binaries may be more complex.
Clarification: This wouldn't be creating a *strong reference cycle*, but is still creating a *strong reference*. A *strong reference* is just when an object (A), has a variable referencing another object (B). B won't be deallocated until A releases the reference, e.g by setting the variable to another value or being deallocated itself. A *strong reference cycle* is when something holds a reference to something else which has a reference to the original something. This can be two objects directly referencing each other: A &lt;--&gt; B Or having a chain of objects which reference back to the first object: A --&gt; B --&gt; C --&gt; D --&gt; A This means that nothing in the chain will ever be deallocated as there is always something with reference each object. In the example given, if `completion` references `self` it will create a strong reference to `self`, meaning that even if the view controller is no longer shown (e.g dismissed or popped) it won't be deallocated until `completion` deallocates and releases the reference to self. Assuming that `getDataFromServer` isn't doing anything funky this will happen when it completes and is done with it's callback closure.
It wouldn't be problem even if the view controller is deallocated as long you are not doing anything with the any properties of that object i.e. as long as you are not accessing \`self\` in the closure. But if you have case to do something by using \`self\` in the closure, it is suggested to take a \`weak\` reference of \`self\` in the capture list to avoid retain cycle. Closures create a \`strong\` reference of self unless specified as \`weak\`.
I found this post very helpful when I faced a similar problem back in time. https://stackoverflow.com/a/41968928/900772
If you are just making a request the reference cycle will disappear after network request is finished. 
A lot of it will be syntatic sugar. As it mentions in the blog post, it's only changes to the stdlib and type system that will be affected. Seeing the proposals for async/await, it is mainly syntactic sugar, under the hood it will still be closures, but for the developer at a high level it is a lot easier to read. As you mentioned, the Obj-C runtime has been around for ages, we've seen the MMR, Garbage Collection and ARC come through in that time. I think with some discussions about how Swift handles numerics, that could lead to big changes in the stdlib if they are proposed, agreed and implemented. But most of the big work has been done, hence the pushback of ABI stability until 5.0.
Alright, I'm going to ask a real jackass question here. I'm about to pick up the Swift mantle again after having not written anything in the language since maybe its first iteration. Obviously I'm going to have to learn the new syntax changes, but does it make sense to hold off another two months for the final syntax changes in 5? Or just learn 4.2 and pick up the delta? I'm not in a particular rush on this project, but I've gone through the Python 2.7 -&gt; 3+ transitions enough times to realize it's a pain in the ass making syntax changes to bring code current. Just want to make sure I'm not shooting myself in the foot by starting now vs in two months (give or take).
This is wrong, there's no retain cycle as the view controller would not own the struct/class which has the `fetchData` method. Can easily be verified in playground class AsyncHelper { static func doAsyncTask(completion: @escaping (String) -&gt; Void) { DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 2) { completion("myString") } } } class Foo { var s: String? func fetchString() { AsyncHelper.doAsyncTask { r in self.s = r } } deinit { print("did deinit") } } var f: Foo? = Foo() f?.fetchString() f = nil // deinit called
Most of the changes are automatically applied by Xcode. With most of the transitions it has been issue with dependencies being the problem. 
Well, that sounds damn simple then. Thanks!
Looks awesome. Thanks for this!
Thank you 🌹🌹
Hint: Register support for that file type in your info.plist then prepare your app to be called by the OS with the file placed in your app's document folder. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2774343/how-do-i-associate-file-types-with-an-iphone-application
Well, what about learn genetic algorithm? For what you intend I am pretty sure you can accomplish.
This is awesome, will definitely use in my projects and contribute.
I am just recalling from the back of my head but maybe it helps. make sure you have valid json(seems like it needs \[ \] around it all) and try something like this: &amp;#x200B; `struct Scores: Decodable {` `let games: [Game]` `}` `Struct Game: Decodable {` `let gameId: Int` `hometeam: Any` `awayteam: Any` `}` `do {` `let scores = try JSONDecoder().decode(Scores.self, from: data)` `for game in scores.games {` `print(game[gameId])` `}` `} catch {}` &amp;#x200B;
from the swift docu: &amp;#x200B; &gt;*Closures* are self-contained blocks of functionality that can be passed around and used in your code. &amp;#x200B; &gt;Global and nested functions, as introduced in [Functions](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Functions.html), are actually special cases of closures. &amp;#x200B; closures are basically blocks (indicated by { } ) of code that can be referenced. a function is also a block of code that can be referenced. a function is a closure. &amp;#x200B;
Thank you, it's my pleasure 🌹
This has been the case with objective c. So what’s your point? 
I believe I made it. It was a statement of information that a lot of people might not understand 
No thanks. 
&gt;What's the advantage of doing that as opposed to just listing them without having them in the Car class and accessing them that way. &amp;#x200B; in your example every car (every instance of car) would have the same attributes, because you have set color, size and weight in your class definition. normally you would set the attributes in the init method so you are able to create different cars. &amp;#x200B; anyway the advantage is that those 3 attributes of car are in a way linked together. they are part of the same object. if you just list them as normal variables there wouldn't be any connection between them. how would you know the weight of the blue car if you have multiple cars? 
I like it, thank you for sharing/making this 🙂
Thank you 🙏🙏
&gt; The Objective-C runtime has been part of the OS forever and that hasn't really bugged off anyone. How many times has the runtime changed in the last 10 years though? Once? I expect Swift will change more often than ObjC has, at least for the next 5 years.
There have been no major syntax changes since the Swift 2 -&gt; 3 transition.
That’s fantastic news. Too many languages bouncing around in my head and I’m never really fully committed to any so I tend to lose things in the noise sometimes. Thanks for following up with that! Sounds like it’ll be easy to just get rolling once I’m more fully up to speed.
Aha, I see! Thank you very much for your help!
In the recent past, without incompatible runtime changes, ObjC got modules, lightweight generics, `instancetype` and nullability annotations. In fact, the only time that Apple broke ABI (which is vastly different than the number of times that Apple changed the runtime, mind you) for ObjC was when they introduced ObjC 2. Even then, new stuff like properties, object subscripts and ARC all worked as language features on targets older than the ObjC version that introduced them. You should browse the proposals that have been accepted for Swift 5 and check how many have anything in “ABI stability impact” section. It’s not that many, and in several cases you wouldn’t know about them. 
Doesn't look very practical man :P
in code, this looks like: fetchData { [weak self] in guard let self = self else { return } // Do stuff } Note the pre-Swift 4.2, you cannot bind the optional self to a value named `self`, so you'd have to do `guard let strong = self else { return }` or something like that
Thanks for the reply. I ended up getting it to work by doing this. Sorry for format im on mobile right now. struct Scores: Decodable { var games: [GameArray] } struct GameArray: Decodable { let gameId: String private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey { case gameId = "gameId" } } This seems odd because in the json fhe gameId definitely looks like an Int, since there are no “ “ around it. My only idea is thay when i use private enum as string it converts the gameId Int to a string. i tried replacing that with Int and it would not work. Any thoughts? Thanks!
it's about displaying formatted text.... NSAttributedText to be precise.
Wait. I am confused now. If it is a weak reference, then isnt it going to be nil if the view controller is deallocated? Then it is going go crash because the closure is trying to do something with properies of “self” which is nil. I thought it should be strong to prevent the case
Thank you! Can you provide an example of how I would set the attributes in an init method?
Good article, thanks OP!
For clarity, I'm not the author of the article. Just sharing an article I liked! I loved the [Night Mode](https://www.latenightswift.com/2018/04/26/implementing-night-mode/) article from last year, so I was excited to see the author had posted some fresh content.
I think [GameplayKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gameplaykit) has the capabilities you're looking for.
I have a little pop up. It just has a label, a text box, an ok and a cancel button. The ok button unwinds to the main VC. This all works fine. I also wanted the keypads return key to work like my ok button, so I set all that up. The problem is that the unwind segue only fires if I touch the button, not on the textFieldShouldReturn function. I understand why, I'm just looking for a way around it.
I was curious to see if anyone would like me to create a cocoapod for this. I have had difficult trying to replicate this in the past and I was wondering if others would find this useful. If not a cocoapod, a tutorial? Just want to see yalls thoughts and try to build a name for myself in the iOS Swift development community. Cheers 🤙🏽
The simplest way is to run a simple PHP script that connects to your database and handles HTTP-requests from your app I would say. In your app you can use NSURL, Alamofire or whatever to send requests for updating or retrieving data. Your PHP will have your database login credentials and only this script will connect to your database. In general it is not a good idea to try connecting your app directly to your database. You want some tutorial, have a look at this one, looks promising: [https://www.w3schools.com/php/php\_mysql\_intro.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_mysql_intro.asp)
Hold down the CMD key and drag it, to any location you want. See video [Layerings views](https://youtu.be/vgfBiZgAVWA) 
I edited post for further explanation. I’m not referring to storyboard, but the app, it’s one VC. With the bottom half of screen a collection view, and top half a uiview. So I’m trying to force the drop in the top UIView to be centered along an axis, let’s say the x axis. 
Use `NSLayoutAnchor`: ``` let constraint = view.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: collectionView.centerXAnchor) ``` and then later: ``` constraint.isActive = true ```
Use `NSLayoutAnchor`: ``` let constraint = view.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: collectionView.centerXAnchor) ``` and then later: ``` constraint.isActive = true ```
lol. It seems like those functions were just bridged from objectiveC so the named would be verbose.
Not trying to do anything to the collectionview, I’m dragging a collectionview cell and dropping into a UIView. Now I did try to use a constraint, and it worked. Kinda What happens on multiple drops, is all of the items that were previously dropped would go back to the drop location of the constraint. So I drag 1 and it drops to the center,of the view as intended. Then I drag around 1 in the view to another location in view. When I then drag another cell from the collectionview and drop it. The first cell repositions itself, at the drop location , so now 1 and 2 are on top of each other.

Weak references are optional types. So, even if we access some property of ‘self’ it wouldn’t crash. The code will look something like this - self?.propertyA = .... Moreover, we usually unwrap the weak captured ‘self’ with the below code ‘guard let self = self else { return }’ This makes sure that if ‘self’ is deallocated already, the code will return from the first itself and none of the following code will be executed.
thank you!
It may be because of the new password auto fill api in iOS that suggests and saves passwords in safari or apps that register a domain. I’m just thinking of a default iOS feature that includes your apps functionality. 
Apple may be very touchy on people making security apps. Silly apps (fart), and weirdo camera apps distributed for free get little examination - But apps for security might get a bit more scruitny or rejection because of worry about password security for users. iOS already has password suggestion, and other big names have password generators. 
I’m pretty sure it’s AVCaptureDevice.autoFocusRangeRestriction = .near 1” still might be too close. 
There's something that you're missing here. \*Where\* would you just list these properties? If you're making an app and not doing stuff in Playgrounds then you cannot have properties that are not inside a class, struct, or enum (there are global variables, which you declare outside these things, but if used at all they are a very small part of an actual app). Apps are made out of Classes, Structs, and Enums. They're simply the building blocks of a program. You want these things because they model the objects used in your app: like Person, User, Book, Workout, or whatever thing you can think of that you can give action (functions) and data (properties) to. I would suggest you take a look at 100DaysOfSwift on HackingWithSwift because it just started February 1st and has covered basic Swift so far. But there's tons of other free resources online. HackingWithSwift is good and Apple has free resources as well (website plus they have ebooks for free). 
Sure, but to be clear, there’s no reason the API layer has to be written in PHP instead of any other language. 
This is amazing, thank you for sharing!
I understand apple can generate passwords, I use keychain all the time to generate passwords for me. It’s awesome, 99% of the time. But that 1% happens enough for me to bother me to make this application. Sometimes keychain acts like a bitch and doesn’t recognize the password fields in certain apps/ websites.
You are absolutely right so I thought why not set the zoom higher? That solved the problem!
 var subnets = [Subnet]() ... self.subnets = response You're declaring a local variable, but then assigning to a property. Which do you want to do?
You will want to use objects that are instances of the Core Data classes (i.e. NSManagedObject subclasses), as generated by your data model. If you have some existing code, you’ll want to transfer that into the definitions for those classes (most likely via extensions.) You need to use those in order to take advantage of the Core Data framework. 
This is called optional chaining, take a look here: https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/OptionalChaining.html The assignment to textLabel?.text will fail gracefully when textLabel is nil (not triggering an error) and set the value of the property text otherwise.
the code above can be translated to : // if textlabel is not nil, then change its text if (textlabel != nil){ textlabel.text = "some text" } else { // if textlabel is nil, do nothing // do nothing }
