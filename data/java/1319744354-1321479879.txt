Hello all - this is horrible "rettiquette", but I posted that code at work on some throw-away account, and am now at home. Thanks very much for all your input! Some responses: The reason I used generics was so that the calling client code could get stuff from it: http://pastebin.com/303vVYQM The stream piper is its own class because it has to implement Runnable (or Callable), and I want to be able to call 'stop' on it. The reviewer's comments mostly stemmed from the fact that, looking at the StreamPiper itself, he wasn't able to see how that fit into the specific solution for which it was designed. I felt that I was writing a small, decoupled utility that doesn't need to be bound to any domain... it just so happens that it is being used as a utility in our test code to pipe FooIn into FooOut. I think he wanted to look at that utility and understand how it fits in the bigger picture, where my contention was that we should write small, well-defined, composable utilities, even if they are currently only used in one way. I thought that, to to understand the whole problem of which that component was just one part, you wouldn't start from there. Thanks again everyone for all your comments! Sorry about my being crap about posting a question with one account and then commenting on the thread in another! 
Being this is your first interview for a technical position, I agree with most of the comments listed below. Some companies will really put you through a grinder of technical questions so it's always best you are prepared. Some additional advice: 1. Slow down. Ask questions. I cannot stress this enough. You may be eager to prove to the interviewer(s) that you are bright by answering questions quickly, but slow down. Specifically, ask questions for problems that aren't immediately obvious to you in order to clear up assumptions. As an example, on one interview I was asked to implement a search method using a binary search tree. I thought he wanted me to implement a search method on nodes for an actual BinaryTree data structure and started coding. There was discussion and then eventual understanding that he wanted me to implement a search method using a binary search algorithm against an integer array. Confusion between the interviewer and candidate makes for a poor rapport. Get clarity on your problem before you dig in, especially when you need to write down actual code in an IDE, whiteboard, or piece of paper. Again, slow down. Ask questions. 2. Always give the trivial/naive answer first to a technical question even if you know an optimal/close-to-optimal solution. Then provide more elegant alternatives following that. Interviewers look to see that you understand there are multiple ways of attacking a problem.
You are right on the whole, as others have said, however you did go over kill on the generics. ie, this will give you a warning with most compilers: public class StreamPiper &lt;IN extends InputStream, OUT extends OutputStream&gt; { public StreamPiper(IN input, OUT output) { // goo! } public static void main(String[] args) { InputStream is = null; OutputStream os = null; new StreamPiper(is, os); } } To fix the warning you would have to do: new StreamPiper&lt;InputStream, OutputStream&gt;(is, os); This is more verbose and in this case is just not needed.
Excuse my lack of knowledge on this matter but does this mean that with the right components I can now offload processing to the GPU in my java applications? Has this been possible for a while now?
I tried 32bit harmony on windows and it barfs with -ms2048M -mx2048M just like the Oracle one. The 32bit limitation is related to memory allocation that is not an issue with 64bit. The only issue I have had with the Oracles 64bit JVM is finding a compatible video playback API as all the old 32bit ones will not work. .^edit^corrected.
You can use a static block for static initialization.
Cool! Had no idea you could use the GPU like that from Java. Will have a closer look at Aparapi.
I agree - it is ugly in java. I actually have a factory method though, so it looks more like this: StreamPiper&lt;MyIn, MyOut&gt; piper = StreamPiper.start(in, out); Performance is not an issue - it's fast enough. I'd leave out the generics, but I like to be able to ask a streampiper instance for the exact types it was created with so I can pass around the typed piper and not have to cast its output stream.

You already have an ad-hoc primitive array system, implemented by bridj as part of its Pointer API, see http://nativelibs4java.sourceforge.net/bridj/api/stable/org/bridj/Pointer.html . It is not backed by Java arrays, it is backed by C pointers past the JNI barrier, and is extremely useful for interacting with other native interfaces such as OpenCL. Note that because of this approach, it is "contiguous" (except not physically so, because of modern virtual memory), and you do not suffer the object and garbage collection overhead of your array tree. You get all of this for a few lines in your pom.xml =) I don't see that it does anything for object references, but your approach is fine and just needs a neat little library made. I suggest taking some wisdom from "Vector" computer science, with configurable branching factor and the option of immutability. See for example Scala's Vector class, which uses Int for compatibility, but already implements an immutable array tree.
CLOSE YOUR OTHER PROJECTS
Yes you can offload processing to the GPU. It's pretty new. Aparapi converts java byte code to openCL for the GPU. It's like fucking magic as far as I'm concerned - I didn't have to write a single piece of actual openCL myself.
That's pretty awesome. IIRC, jCUDA just uses JNI.
Holy shit this is pretty amazing. I'm gonna play around with it.
It just performs a very basic calculation many times. There is no point to this other than to try Aparapi.
&gt;Unfortunately based on your question, I would not hire you. The whole point of a software engineer is to bridge the gap between domain knowledge of the users and programming code. If you are honestly having trouble converting non-technical knowledge into an "algorithm" then you are most probably going to be really bad at every real-world programming project I am likely to throw at you. thanks for that.

Arrays are homogeneous which means that they can only contain elements of a single type. Using an array this way won't work. An 'object' in Java can be thought of as a way to package heterogenous elements together.
http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript
Agreed on the /r/javascript comment, but since we're here... Look at the line with the while() statement. Anything on that line after the "//" becomes part of the comment, so your "{" isn't interpreted as the start of a block. Try changing the line to: while (count &lt;= number) { // This adds the price of the current item to the total. 
&gt; Because calling a method through a base class has a bit more overhead than calling it directly (and calling through an interface has a tiny bit more still) I thought this was true for a long time, but in an attempt to demonstrate to someone else in /r/java that I am not, in fact, "so fucking stupid it's scary", I coded up a quick benchmark and discovered that the difference is negligible, at least on the JVM I was running (Oracle Java 7 SDK with none of the EE bullshit).
I've been using Eclipse for over 4 years. TIL you can close a project :)
lol, yeah. Closing projects keeps Eclipse from trying to manage all the resources in them. My prof had probably hundreds of projects open and when I told him about this he said that there was a noticeable increase in responsiveness.
oh, you did not go there! I hate you and your lined up brackets.
What exactly can't you figure out? Are you able to make a *Weapon* class? Do you not understand how to make an array of *Weapon* objects? 
Sorry if it was meant as a joke. But, I don't think it makes sense to close them when you have only 7 projects... At work I support 8-10 projects in parallel, never have got any problems with that. I'd say if you get confused when searching for resources or types with Ctrl+Shift+T or Ctrl+Shif+R, then create working sets, and restrict the search to the working set you're using now.
Yeah it was a joke, It's more of a pet peeve for me. Though there really is no downside of closing your projects, especially if you're on a slower computer or a computer that needs all the speed it can get. 
So this is the reason that your co-worker told you to just use the implementations. The generics is way more complicated than it needs to be. If you can just get the implementation from the class, your code and the code that calls it becomes cleaner and easier to read. You are violating YAGNI.
could you paste the code? I would like to screw a little around, if you don't mind
I think your friend is talking about something like [this](http://pastebin.com/gzd90iKg).
you lost me at "unit tests calling a web service"... Seriously though, have you tried actually setting a value for weblogic.wsee.verbose?
sorry shouldve been weblogic.wsee.verbose=*
import com.amd.aparapi.Kernel; public class FirstKernel extends Kernel { public static void main (String [] args) { FirstKernel kernel = new FirstKernel (); kernel.setExplicit(true); long startTime; long endTime; for (int i=0;i&lt;10;i++) { startTime = System.nanoTime(); int j=0; for (j=0;j&lt;kernel.inA.length;j++) { int k=0; for (k=0;k&lt;256;k++) kernel.result[j]=kernel.inA[j]*kernel.inB[j]; } endTime = System.nanoTime(); long RAW_TIME = (endTime-startTime); System.out.println("raw execution time "+i+": "+RAW_TIME); startTime = System.nanoTime(); kernel.execute(kernel.inA.length,1); endTime = System.nanoTime(); long GPU_TIME = (endTime-startTime); System.out.println("raw execution time "+i+": "+GPU_TIME); System.out.println("speed ratio : openCL is "+((double) RAW_TIME/(double)GPU_TIME)+" x faster than (single core) CPU \n"); } } public FirstKernel () { for (int i=0;i&lt;inA.length;i++) { inA[i]=(int) (Math.random()*256); inB[i]=(int) (Math.random()*256); } } final int inA[] = new int [1000000]; final int inB[] = new int [inA.length]; final int result[] = new int [inA.length]; public void run() { int i= getGlobalId(); int k=0; for (;k&lt;256;k++) result[i]=(inA[i]*inB[i]); } } 
in case it's not clear, this program does nothing of value. It just demos that aparapi is working by repeatedly multiplying two value. There are a million ints in the array, and each one is calculated 256 times.
thx
Yup. I have to, since I have 24 projects at any one given time, and since those 24 are split between 3 code bases (with plenty of repetition there anyway), Eclipse gets confused by having 24 "MyFreakinBean.java" files. 
If you are serious about reuse, you should at least give all Java classes the correct package, like org.yourname.yourpackage.ClassName (if you own yourname.org).
Interesting, thanks!
If you want anyone to take more than a cursory look then you should explain clearly why your new wonder framework is better than the zillion other frameworks out there. A jevon points out, if you can't even name your packages sanely then there's not a lot of hope. At the moment you're classified under "re-invent wheel, type square".
You are right. I should state clearly that it is more of an experiment then full blown framework targeted towards wide adoption.
If you are using the standard domain scripts (startWebLogic) then you should see the server startup line echoed to the terminal. I don't think JAVA_OPTIONS itself is echoed AFAIK. But you should see your -D settings in the line following "Starting WLS with line". And that second option should be redirecting to the server log, I think, not the terminal. But depending on your log setup, you might see them on the terminal also. 
Regardless of whether it's an experiment or not you should always follow best practices.
Thank you ill give it a go
The array index and the number are the same, you could do an array of strings that equal the weapon name, and pick the ARRAY INDEX randomly, Also try googling dictionaries Personally Id make a base weapon class then weaponSword weaponGun ect classes that extend weapon
I can explain the discrepancy on the first call to Kernel.execute(range). On the first call to Kernel.execute(range) the Aparapi runtime has to parse the bytecode of the kernel.run() (and run-reachable method), convert to OpenCL and compile to an OpenCL Kernel. This cost is usually &lt;200ms or so and is only performed once. Full disclosure, I am the Aparapi developer.
Things to try: * do a output.flush() after your writeInt() (on both client and server) * wrapping your inputStream in a BufferedInputStream
WOW, I just wanted to say 'thank you' for your work. It's a fucking brilliant idea to convert bytecode itself so the developers don't actually have to do openCL.
What problem does it solve ?
Read the JavaDocs on List &amp; ArrayList. Generally, you'll want to have the question as a String, a List of answer Strings instantiated as an ArrayList, and an int for the index of the right answer. You have the file format, and it should be easy to parse (lots of readLine). 
I have run wireshark while running this program and wireshark comes up with a 3 byte length packet that carries the information, then a 1 byte packet and an empty packet for every piece of data sent. I am not sure how to interpret this. "Also split up the output.writeInt(input.readInt()); to see what time the readInt is taking and what time the writeInt is taking" Thats what I had originally and writeInt() takes up about 0-1 ms :) The readInt takes 400ms so its really a bugger
readInt() will block until there are enough bytes in the socket to actually read an integer. Perhaps the client isn't flushing its data properly causing this delay. As suggested by mazing, flush your socket after the data has been written to it.
So, what do you need? 1. A `main` class, it does nothing but carry the main function. 2. A `game` class, that holds the questions and game logic 3. A `question` class that holds a string that is the question and a java.util.ArrayList of Answers; and which answer is correct. I'd store the correct answer here because an answer of "4" may be correct for 2+2, but it isn't for 2+3, so the question really determines this. 4. An `answer`class that has answers. 5. A fileReading class that reads the questions from the file and puts them into question objects (which are probably also going into a java.util.ArrayList)
I have put in the output.flush() after the writes, but the result stays the same, +- 400 ms difference infront of the readInt() and after. Unfortunately, wrapping my inputStream in a BufferedInputStream isnt a possibility, because for the program in which i use this network setup I need all the data as soon as they arrive, and as I understand BufferedInputStream might cause some data to arrive simultaneously with other data that was sent later.
If you don't want to use maps it is possible to store the name in one array and the value in another. Then reference each by the index of the value. However, it would be better to create a "Weapon" Class and make a Weapon[] Array.
I have flushed the outputs after every write, but the delay remains.
I just compiled your files and they ran well for me, and quickly saturated my network. I am thinking this might be nagle's algorithm that is causing the delay. When you create the socket on the server and the client, try using clientSocket.setTcpNoDelay(true); and let me know if it works any differently. Also, are you running these files locally or connected to a server? It is entirely possible for a message to have a round trip of 400 milliseconds if the server is bogged down with other things or its located across the country. edit: I failed to mention that the program's output was 0 milliseconds.
Sure, you *could* (I can--in fact--think of an implementation entirely in the "main" class without even a main() function), but in a real world situation one class should do one thing. If you wanted to change the format of the file, then you'd just change the reader to read differently. Answers may just be Strings with no additional data with them like points or anything and always calling it Answer.getText() may be more trouble than it's worth, but it could also come back to be a pain to rewrite the code to add a point value to each answer. There is, of course, a programming theory of YAGNI (You aren't going to need it.), where present-you doesn't do extra programming for future-you, but that doesn't mean present-you doesn't *design* to make future-you's life easier. Of course you'll probably never look at this code again after today, but you might use it as an example of how you're competent in a job interview.
"I just compiled your files and they ran well for me, and quickly saturated my network." Saturated your network? "When you create the socket on the server and the client, try using clientSocket.setTcpNoDelay(true); and let me know if it works any differently." It did solve it actually :D They are now popping in at a normal latency of about 10-20. Thanks alot :) "Also, are you running these files locally or connected to a server? It is entirely possible for a message to have a round trip of 400 milliseconds if the server is bogged down with other things or its located across the country." I am running both server and client on my computer, but the IP address in the client is my internet IP. localhost and 192.168 etc works fine.
It means you are not buffering so things just get cut to whatever the OS is doing at the time, and it will process each byte at it s leisure. http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/BufferedInputStream.html 
You can do both, since there was no spec given. Are you supposed to be doing file I/O? If you are, I'd say take the filename as input. 
Note that this is a *very* inefficient way of reading/writing a lot of data, there will likely be one operating system call for each byte in the integer.. wrap your streams in BufferedInput/Output streams, this will help even if you flush() after each integer written, and will help throughput enormously if you don't. 
Could you demonstrate how to do this, because I have tried and failed.
&gt; an implementation entirely in the "main" class without even a main() function I'm interested in learning more about this program without a main function.
[Hope this is a start](http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=dectYsBU). This is the easy part. I always hated parsing input from a text file, although it's easy. You can find good tutorials online.
You'll have much more success posting this on Stackoverflow. That's really the right site for this kind of question. Good luck!
Thanks for the heads up. I've never gone to Stackoverflow except when linked from here. I'll give it a shot!
Not sure - I know it is used primarily for mp3, but might have some other support too. However, remember that java does natively support AIFF and WAV, but they are large uncompressed formats. 
When I saw the title I thought this was /r/shittyadvice
Well, in order to allow you to initialize static members of a class, java runs any code outside of functions inside of blocks marked `static` when the class loader sees the class the first time. The class in question would be: public class Main { static{ System.out.println("Hello World"); } } Now, running this presents a problem because the classloader throws an exception when it can't find `public static void main(String)`. So we just make sure the classloader doesn't get to try that: public class Main { static{ System.out.println("Hello World"); System.exit(0); } } Now, this isn't *for* this, and if you use it for this you're kind of evil. The great thing is you can have as many of these blocks scattered anywhere in the class.
A couple of things to keep in mind (you did all of them in my glance at your code). Always use the string constrictor. The only other constrictor is for double and it will get you into floating point hell where 0d != 0. Also set scale with a rounding mode is important if you don't want to know the 37th decimal point. I go for round half even personally because it doesn't accumulate issues over time, but half up can be more natural. 
You're 5. This is way above your head. Go outside and play. but seriously, if you are some sort of sicko who craves multiple inheritance - this is about as close as Java will get to that. Now go clean your room.
I'd suggest you got your hands on a copy of Head-First Design Patterns and read the first chapter (strategy pattern) - about the best like-I'm-5 explanation of why interfaces are the bomb that I've ever read.
Ha, fair enough. It's mainly for an assignment.
Cool, thanks.
That's probably a good starting book. Once you are more advanced, and if you want to continue learning java, I'd check out this book. It's literally the best java book ive ever read. http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-2nd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1319858709&amp;sr=1-1
I tried, but they're just too damn useful to put into words for a 5 year old.
A big use is to swap out implementation details, as long as the class has the specified methods, it can do whatever it wants behind the scenes with what you give it.
I have a 1963 VW Beetle car, because the engine fits an "interface" or promises it will fit in a certain way, I can replace it with many different years of engines, some faster some slower. I can replace it with an engine from the 70s or even go back to an 50s engine. I can only replace it with another engine (it is an engine interface), but I can pick the engine that fits my needs best. Some people have really pushed the engine interface and added electrical engines or even modern car engines. On interfaces, I think people often go too far creating interfaces when they fulfill no actual need. If you are unit testing, you can often refactor later to add the interface. I only create an interface when I need two different versions of something, never when I "might need a second later."
Thank you very much. :D I'll keep those in mind whenever I use BigDecimals.
An interface is a contract. When you implement an interface, you're agreeing to fulfill your end of the contract (the methods of the interface). The other side of the relationship is using an interface. If you have an object that implements an interface, you can use any of the interface methods safely because you're guaranteed that the object fulfills the contract defined by the interface. To borrow rsperko's car analogy, you could define a contract with these requirements: - starts with a key - using gas pedal speeds up - using break slows down Most people are familiar with these actions, so car manufacturers make all their cars fulfill this contract, and that way everyone will know how to drive them.
The example they use in the book is if you needed a few different pets like cats, dogs, birds, you would make a pet interface, and use that to handle actions that they all need, like to make a noise. Then, when you make your dog, you can fill in the details of making a noise with dog specific things. The advantage to using an interface is that you can have an ArrayList of pet objects, with each one a different type of pet, and call .makeNoise() on them, and depending on what type of pet they are, they will handle the call differently.
I didn't really get the point of interfaces either, until I started playing with event listeners and graphics. I realized the entire point of forcing methods to be created is because some classes rely on that method existing. If you force an implementation of an interface on certain classes, you are guaranteed that an object that implements that interface has that method, even if they choose not to do anything with it besides declare it. To borrow from rsperko's example, let us say there you are creating car objects and you want to be able to make each car do something. Each Car class implements an Automobile interface that has methods like honk(), steer(Direction dir), brake(int pressureLevel) etc and each car class has to implement these methods. Now if we make more specific classes (like Ferrarri, Porsche, whatever) that extend the car class, because of polymorphism these new objects will also have the action methods from the Automobile interface. If we were to make an array of objects like Porsche[] that are sub-classes of the Car class, we know that we could call the honk() method on all of them because the Car class implements the Automobile interface and is thus forced to utilize the honk() method. Sorry if this was incoherent or incorrect but I'm late and drunk but I felt the same pain you did when I first learned about interfaces. 
There has been an argument going on about whether or not this question is poorly worded and answers other then the correct one could also be valid. People have been making the argument that bool is short for boolean which is a primitive type and int by definition is an Integer that both of those could be construed as possible answers. I for one think because it clearly says "in Java" that there is clearly only one answer, I just want to get some other peoples opinions.
primitive data types are called "primitive" because they are not created from classes. Instead of instantiating objects, you create variables from the primitive data types, and variables do not have attributes or methods. They are simply to hold a single value in memory. That being said, Integer is the name of the Integer class. Not a primitive data type. String is the name of the String class. Not a primitive data type. Bool, may be short for boolean but it is not used to create a variable. Finally you have short, which is a primitive data type because it is created, not instantiated and is only used to hold data. I hope I made sense.
Which is why the question is not confusing imo, it has a quite clearly defined answer in the constraints of a Java primitive.
Right the question is not confusing at all. And you get an upvote for making me write out my explanation :)
2 classes, 1 type that does not exist in Java, and 1 primitive... one only needs the most basic understanding of Java to pick the correct answer without even thinking.
Here is what I think. The words starting with capitals are classes, not primitives. Of the other two only one is a valid java keyword. So no, not confusing. It is a good test of the language. http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html
&gt; Of course you'll probably never look at this code again after today, but you might use it as an example of how you're competent in a job interview. If I interviewed someone and they used code from a 101 class to show they are competent I would probably ignore everything else they said... Just saying
interfaces make mocking _tons_ easier. 
nope, very clear
I'll make an attempt, but I usually suck at explaining so... In my current project, I have entities. Some entities need to be rendered, some don't. So the ones that need to be rendered have an interface IRenderable with a Draw() method. So when the time comes to render, I just go through all of my entities, check if they are IRenderable, and if so call their Draw() method. Hope that helped somewhat?
That is actually a really good description!
One more place where they can be useful is in refactoring nasty code. Let's say you inherit a class from a previous programmer, PandaInACar, with non-private methods like "goForward(int feet)" and "eatBamboo(int numShoots)". Probably, most places in your code that take a PandaInACar could really just take any old Panda or any old Car. Making PandaInACar implement both Panda and Car and eliminating references to the class in favor of references to the interfaces can be a good first step toward splitting the class.
Lets say you have instances of 5 different classes in a List (rsperko, radmobile, vauce, omnicrash, macdemort) which all implement an interface JavaRedditor with a single method .describeAnInterface() Since they all implement that one method, you can iterate over that list for(JavaRedditor javaRedditor : javaRedditorList ){ String description = javaRedditor.describeInterface(); System.out.println(description); } Look what happened, you got five different implementations depending on which JavaRedditor you looped over. That's pretty flexible! When it comes times to test your method, you could create a dummy class (MockJavaRedditor) that implements the same JavaRedditor interface. Your new test class would work just as well in your looping code as the real JavaRedditors.
Data Structures is a 200 level class, and you'll interview 2 kinds of software engineers: those for whom it's their first job, and those for whom it isn't. People looking for their first job will probably use class samples, and the rest will probably ask for a small programming task to complete because most of what they've done is probably proprietary. The advantage of this is that you can also understand the entire codebase. Also, you might end up reusing the *objects* and extending it into a decent project with swing or whatever and it's best not to screw over your future self, because I guarantee he'll think you're an idiot even at your best (if you're doing it right).
I see a lot of car analogies. Which are awesome. But a real code example that might clear it up is the interface [Comparable](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html). Whenever you dump a bunch of objects into a list, it won't be able to sort them for you because it just doesn't know how. It doesn't know what constitutes one object being greater than the other. The list does have one rule though. It says I'll sort this stuff for you as long as you implement Comparable, letting me know how to order these things. It doesn't matter if they are cars or numbers. I don't care, as long as they are *comparable* when we look at the api, being Comparable (or implementing the interface Comparable) just means that you have a method called compareTo allowing 2 types of your objects to be compared. Another real life example of this is the Observer pattern. Look it up on wikipedia ;) 
[Think of a letterbox](http://alexcollins.org/blog/2011/what-is-an-interface-in-java).
*constructor
Seems like its the import line 
CTRL-SHFT-O
First off, what IDE are you using? I'm assuming you aren't placing your classes in "packages" right? You don't actually need the import statement (if they are just in the same default package which I'm pretty sure they are). Just remove the import and try to run it.
You don't need to import classes in the default namespace. Remove the import line. Read up on how packages work (tip: classes need to be in their proper folders).
No problem! Good luck learning Java, make sure you go outside and get some sun too.... (bad programmer stereotype)
&gt; People have been making the argument that bool is short for boolean which is a primitive type and int by definition is an Integer that both of those could be construed as possible answers. Aside from myself almost getting this wrong (bool vs boolean always messes me up when I switch between languages) then no this question is extremely clear. &gt; I for one think because it clearly says "in Java" that there is clearly only one answer, I just want to get some other peoples opinions. Right, and the distinction between Integer vs int is very important for a Java programmer. Dat autoboxing :X
I do see the value there, although with a good mock library it does not matter so much. I try not to create interfaces just for mocks and testing. EasyMock, Mockito, I think even jMock can easily mock a class too. Your point is really valuable when multiple teams are working on something. You create the interface and one team can mock the other team's system to get going. I try to have no illusions that the mock wont be at least slightly wrong in the end but it helps communication.
Upvote for the right decision: first the language, then an IDE (Anyway CTRL-SHIFT-O is worth to remember in eclipse).
Did you try the native javax.crypto library? Send me a pm with the details of the assignment and I'll see if I can help you out.
I think multiple inheritance makes sense in some cases. Interfaces allow you to do more though.
I think it would also help if r/javahelp subreddit is listed in r/LearnProgramming's sidebar. Please contact learnprogramming's moderator for this.
Downvoting for an obvious, "please do my homework for me."
Haha I totally agree with you! My APCS class was based around writting data structures. My teacher always said we'd understand them if we made them ourselves. It was a blast. I loved making things like doubly linked lists, circular singly linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, sets, etc. Had a blast.

Is it a file extension association problem? Do other .jar files run from the x64 desktop?
I learned Java in a few days using the Oracle tutorial. http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ A good starting point might be here: http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html 
Yup, every [program/app](http://www.indiedb.com/members/doppler/games) works for my x64. This is the only odd ball considering I use similar code over and over to create projects.
Open up a command prompt and type in.. java -jar FlashPlanner_v0.2.jar This should give you the stack trace as to why it is failing. This is what I get in OSX. Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: FlashPlannerMenu : Unsupported major.minor version 51.0 That error means that it is compiled for a version of Java which I don't have installed on the machine. Other then that windows 7 has some funky security about letting certain things execute depending where they are. Try moving it to a different directory. 
Class file format 51.0 is used in Java 7, only Java 7 and later JVM understand that format. So maybe 'fragem''s Eclipse used a Java 7 JRE (at least FlashPlannerMenu.class was compiled in that format), but a Java 6 JRE is still associated with double-clicking on Jar files on his or her computer. There is another problem with the Jar file. When I looked at its content, I saw that it contains the following classes: org/eclipse/jdt/internal/jarinjarloader/JIJConstants.class org/eclipse/jdt/internal/jarinjarloader/JarRsrcLoader$ManifestInfo.class org/eclipse/jdt/internal/jarinjarloader/JarRsrcLoader.class org/eclipse/jdt/internal/jarinjarloader/RsrcURLConnection.class org/eclipse/jdt/internal/jarinjarloader/RsrcURLStreamHandler.class org/eclipse/jdt/internal/jarinjarloader/RsrcURLStreamHandlerFactory.class Those are internal Eclipse classes. I don't know how they landed inside the Jar, and it works probably just fine (if all the needed Eclipse class files are together in the Jar), but 'fragem' should find how they got in there and how to change that.

If you are looking for an IDE I would use eclipse. http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/indigosr1 Eclipse has a lot of "fixes" for common mistakes etc. Fripletister linked a good starting point as well.
Haha! I used to line up my brackets when I first learned, but now I hate all that extra space that a { or } takes up on a whole line. I don't even use brackets if I can avoid it.
I agree with the Oracle and Eclipse comments. They are both well written and clear. I also have "Learning Java 3rd Edition". I like how it is written and am finding it the most useful and interesting.
This was actually very helpful! I manually installed the current x64 version of Java and the program worked flawlessly. I find it a bit strange that the .jar somehow includes code only compatible for different services. Is there a way to export the .jar to a more compatible state? or am I importing code that is simply not available for older versions? Thanks again!
Yeah that is like the only thing I know about Java programming: Use eclipse, all the cool kids do.
I only really say that because, I'm pretty sure the oracle website would recommend netbeans... and its pretty horrendous. Doing some j2ee work with it right now and im about to freak out.
Really? I prefer netbeans to eclipse when doing any java. I only recently started using eclipse because I needed it for the GWT and the other google java libraries.
I've been having issues with debugging for some reason, my breakpoints trip but trying to "step over" or "step into" will always just resume execution and keep running. Other than that, I find Netbeans a little sluggish compared to Eclipse. I guess I'm just biased, Netbeans isn't too bad, but the debugging bug that I have makes me mad.
When you are developing a JSR-168 (portlet 1.0) or JSR-286 (portlet 2.0) application, you include a portlet.xml deployment descriptor that tells the portlet container about the portlets contained in your WAR file. The portlet.xml is to portlets what the web.xml is to servlets. The actual mechanism of adding portlets to a page is not specified in the standard and is left to each individual container. For example, with Liferay (my preferred portlet container), it's drop and drag. With Liferay, you can also embedded certain portlets within custom themes. Depending on your portlet container and the API that it offers, you can probably write some sort of search/global registry function to make it easier to find and add portlets to pages. Most containers offer an out of the box search functionality to find portlets.
When you create xmas, the time (hours, minutes, seconds) are set to the current time. &gt; The Calendar returned is based on the current time in the default time zone with the default locale. ([source](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html#getInstance()) So your code is correct, if not really what you want. 
Add; xmas.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, 0); xmas.set(Calendar.MINUTE, 0); xmas.set(Calendar.SECOND, 0); To zero out the time as well as the date. [i.e. to set the time xmas starts to be 0:00.00 on the 25th december]
perfect, thank you
Thank you very much! :)
Apparently I started the project with jre 1.7 checked. I switched the library to jre 1.6 and it worked flawlessly. Thank you everyone for the help!
Funny, I just started this today but for Halloween! My code (if you want to use it) is below: // TODO: make it account for time-zones public static int getDaysUntilHalloween(){ return 1; }
Use JodaTime. It's a much better time library than Java's built in one, and it makes problems like this really easy: DateTime now = DateTime.now(); DateTime christmas = new DateMidnight(2011, 12, 25); Duration nowUntilChristmas = new Duration(now, christmas); Then you can access all the fields of nowUntilChristmas that you need.
One liner ;) TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.toDays(1324767600000L-System.currentTimeMillis())
This is not an active enough subreddit to necessitate another one, IMO.
Really fast code on Java. Yes!
I'd be interested in this as well. I've been having nothing but trouble getting Slick set up.
Depends on how you're drawing your graphics. If you are drawing them by overriding the paint method of your control and drawing the sprite at different coordinates as it moves, you'll need to add a MouseListener to the control you're drawing in and then check the coordinates in the MouseEvent to see if they fall on the current position of your sprite. If you're animating by moving a label with an image arrond in its container, just add a click listener to the label, or replace your label with a button and set the border to null and setConentAreaFilled(false). In either case with this method, I think you'll get click events for the whole bounding box of your moving control, not just your opaque pixels. (Though I'm not 100% sure on this.)
Same, this would be awesome, gaming in Java is one area I've never ever looked into, but it sounds fun.
I find most of the information in their forums. I even got a fully mavenized project going for the first time this past weekend so I don't have to dink around with the native libraries. I'm sure you already have these links but just in case... http://slick.cokeandcode.com/wiki/doku.php?id=tutorials - They mostly work although may take some minor corrections to get working. http://slick.cokeandcode.com/wiki/doku.php?id=open_source_games - When in doubt, look at somebody else's source! --- For creating a mavenized project... Most of this was obtained by poking around the Internet and fiddling with stuff. I did need to manually install the Slick library into my local maven install, but otherwise everything else is pulled down automagically. There is a Slick maven repo but I had no luck getting it to work. [Maven pom.xml](http://pastebin.com/230DQaxX) [src/META-INF/Assembly.xml](http://pastebin.com/sFDxBUps) src/main/scripts/run.bat - Just the one line below. java -jar -Djava.library.path="${release.natives}" "${finalName}" [src/main/scripts/run.sh](http://pastebin.com/kPnUpic1)

The best way to learn slick is to use the single class tests included with Slick2D. Grab the slick2d source code (should be in the slick.zip bundle), then look in org.newdawn.slick.tests, each test shows you how to use a particular Slick2D feature and almost every feature of Slick2D is covered.
Thanks this helped :)
Thanks
I don't see how adding the synchronized keyword to your Server class would actually do anything - it's just returning the server object, not changing anything. What case are you trying to avoid? Also, don't use Vector, use ArrayList.
I guess it wouldn't change anything. So I should remove the synchronized from getServer() and add it to the getClients() method? In the code I posted, Client is really a thread that handles socket reading and writing. That's why I wanted to make sure it's thread safe, so clients can talk to the server and each other safely. For some reason, I though adding synchronized to the getServer() method would make sure that all members of the Server that is returned would also be synchronized. Edit: after some reading, why wouldn't I use Vector? Vector is a class whose members are already synchronized.
&gt; all members of the Server that is returned would also be synchronized No, not at all unfortunately. All it means is that the code between the open and close braces of the block will only be executed by one thread at once. It's hard because I can't quite understand what you're trying to prevent yet, but I'm pretty sure that synchronizing the `getClients` call is also not going to do what you hope. Somewhat unrelated; It looks like you mean for Server to be a singleton. Normally you'd make the method for obtaining an instance of Server a static method of the Server class itself. There's also some fancy schmancy stuff you'll want to do to -really- ensure you only ever create a single instance: public class Server { private Server(){ //Create a new server object } private static class instanceHolder{ public static Server instance = new Server(); } public static Server getInstance(){ return instanceHolder.instance; } } Because of the way the Java Memory Model works this is guaranteed to only instantiate a single copy of Server and provides lazy init of the instance.
Yes, I should make Server a singleton, thanks. I've read some more about synchronization and I understand a bit better, but now I don't know when I should be synchronizing and when I shouldn't. Imagine I have a thread other than Server that wants to disconnect a client, and I wanted to do it like this: MainProgram.getServer().getClients.get(0).disconnect(); And imagine that this might be called by many different threads. Where would I need to sychronize? How can I ensure that I don't try to disconnect a client that has already been disconnected by another thread?
To reply to your edit; [here's](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1386275/why-java-vector-class-is-considered-obsolete-or-deprecated) a pretty good explanation from SO.
Ah, that makes a lot more sense now. Thanks.
First, the getClients should probably return a copy of its list of clients, and that should be synchronized: // Server.java public synchronized List&lt;Client&gt; getClients(){ return new ArrayList&lt;Client&gt;(this.clients); } And the disconnect method should probably also be synchronized: // Client.java public boolean disconnect(){ if(isConnected){ synchronized(this){ if(isConnected){ // Disconnection logic. } } } return isConnected; } In regards to your question about multiple threads trying to disconnect the same client: It seems like a pretty harmless thing to do, provided you only do the disconnect logic once, as described above.
Alright, one more question: Why should I return a copy of clients? Is that so that any further operations will be "thread-safe" simply because they are operating on the copy of the list?
If it were up to me, I would return an unmodifiable list (you can can quickly get an unmodifiable view of a list via Collections.UnmodifiableList(myList) ). The reason for doing so (or a copy of the list as Neres28 suggested) is as so: * imagine thread 1 &amp; 2 both called getClients() * then what if thread 1 calls remove(0). if thread 1 calls get(...), it will refer to either a different client or throw and index out of bounds exception, because all of the list indexing has changed.
Primarily because returning the actual list breaks encapsulation not so much thread safety concerns. You could return the actual list, then **always** wrap access to the list in a synchronized block that synchronized on the list itself: List&lt;Client&gt; clients = Server.getInstance().getClients(); synchronized(clients){ for(Client client : clients){ // do your thing, } } It might be worth your time to see if there's a way to architect your project that doesn't depend so strongly on interacting threads. An eventing architecture comes to mind.
Right, I guess I need to figure out a better way to ensure that remove() operations are not going to cause problems with anything trying to access that list.
Ah, so it would be better to do something along the lines of: Server.getInstance().disconnectClientByIP(127.0.0.1); // or for accessing a client Server.getInstance().getClientAt(0) So that the Server class can handle all the operations, rather than letting some other class access that information. Also, I will look into event-driven architectures instead. Threading has turned out to be much more difficult than I thought, or maybe what I'm trying to do is just ill-suited for threading.
* If you don't know the answer don't be afraid to say so! * If the job is very specifically in jsp then brush up on it. Make something small in tomcat or some other app server in the meantime. * I know you're desperate but you have to relax. Just keep telling yourself that you'll find another job soon. * Don't say that you're desperate! That will make them think that you're just taking the job because you have to and will jump ship ASAP.
Thank you so much, ill keep your suggestions in mind. I am already going through revision of some of the basic concepts of JSP and servlets. Thank you again.
1. Make sure you're at least a little comfortable with HTML. At the end of the day, you have to output HTML (generally). 2. At least have looked at JSTL, maybe they don't use it, but take a glance. 3. Jakarta Struts is good to look at. 4. Relax. 5. Know where you'd look for an answer. If you don't know, say I'm not sure, but I was recently reading Horstmann's book and there's a chapter about it I'd review or that you could check google. 6. Think about your best quality, worst quality, (or how to answer these questions). 7. I have not personally read, but have heard EXCELLENT things from many people about [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/1466208686). I understand you don't have much time left for this, but if there is a next interview, it might be worth the read. (You might call actual book stores rather than wait on an online store.)
Bonus tip: use the word "Excited" instead of "Desperate".
looks like there are methods on the IMAPStore that you can use to determine the folder, IE: getFolder(), getSharedNameSpaces(). You might have to cast you store to an IMAPStore.
Make sure you have a basic understanding of web servers, and how they work. Briefly... some other topics to brush up on: 1.HTTP Requests (doPost v doGet) 2.Ajax &amp; the XMLHttpRequest object 3.What goes in a JSP v what goes in a servlet (a strong understanding of MVC doesn't hurt) -- But most importantly dress sharp and act confident! 
Yep, tried all those. They work fine with my own mailbox but don't help me with accessing additional mailboxes. I get the feeling that store.connect(server,username,password) doesn't know to look for *other* mailboxes that may have been subscribed to...
Don't wear a suit. Nobody trusts a programmer in a suit. Wear your everyday clothes - jeans and a t-shirt works fine. Exception for this might be if you're interviewing for a big multinational with a dress-code.
I think this is bad advice. You should err on the side of caution and *always* ask the person who set up the interview what to wear.
I had a chance to flesh-out the example that I gave: DateTime now = DateTime.now(); DateMidnight christmas = new DateMidnight(2011, 12, 25); Duration nowUntilChristmas = new Duration(now, christmas); System.out.println(String.format("Time until Christmas: %d days %d hours %d minutes %d seconds", nowUntilChristmas.getStandardDays(), nowUntilChristmas.getStandardHours(), nowUntilChristmas.getStandardMinutes(), nowUntilChristmas.getStandardSeconds())); 
second that 
Any claims you make on your CV need to be backed up. The best way is to make sure you have an example of each of the different things you have on the CV. For example if you say I can work with JSP's then show them some code you've written. Be confident and also show that you will integrate well with the team. I've seen less qualified people get hired over others due to the fact that they are just much nicer people to work with. You do not have to know everything they ask you, just make sure that you show that you have a good ability to learn new things and you should be set. 
I agree... if you look fake then they will think that from the first point. Rephrase, if I see you come in wearing a suite I immediately think you are hiding something (it doesn't stop me from employing you however). I would wear smart casual. Nice leather shoes, jeans, collared shirt.
re: .jsp Install Eclipse, RunJettyRun, and do some quick .jsp pages. Send me a PM if you want help with anything. re: interview I am hopeless at interviews, I have had only 3 interviews in my life (2 ended up in a job), and my other 5 jobs were based on referral from friends! Good Luck!
Don't forget your classic java questions, differences between interfaces and abstract classes will usually get asked. Design patterns probably come to you intuitively now, but brush up on the names and go in with examples of where you've used what. Essentially go in with examples ready to mind of the work you're most proud of and the most interesting projects/bugs you've solved. Good luck!
I don't understand why you need synchronization here. You synchronize access to shared data - where is the shared data? Synchronization will guarantee mutual exclusivity to shared data through invoking objects gaining a lock on the synchronized object - but your threads are Server objects, so each one has it's own instance variables upon which it invokes methods. Synchronizing the getServer() method will bottleneck the programs performance in terms of it's ability to retrieve servers. If multiple server threads were writing to a variable within a single instance of the main program, then the corresponding getter method should be synchronized.
&gt; Also, don't use Vector, use ArrayList. I see your quality recommendation and will one-up you, sir/madam: getClients() should return List&lt;Client&gt;, not the actual list implementation.
Also, if you move forward with using Java and you plan on doing multiple executions in an attempt to get an average of time spent encrypting/decrypting, you might find JETM[1] to be useful. 1. http://jetm.void.fm/
there seem to be mistake in line for(int j = y - (int)(markradY * 1.2); j &lt;= y + (int)(markradY * 1.2); j += (markradX / 5)) { I think it should be j += (markradY / 5) instead of j += (markradX / 5). also if markradX is int less than 5 then markradX / 5 = 0 and it will be infinite loop. 
&gt; the Server class can handle all the operations, rather than letting some other class access that information I think you're getting there. In software engineering there's an ideal we strive for called High [Cohesion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_%28computer_science%29), Low [Coupling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_%28computer_programming%29). High cohesion basically means that code within a unit or module should be strongly related in functionality; for an example, albeit an obvious one, your Server class shouldn't have any game logic in it. Low coupling means, simply, that modules are largely **in**dependent of other modules. Units of code with a lot of inputs, global dependencies (including dependencies on Singletons), and call paths (places from which they're called and they call to) typically have a high coupling. I can't say for certain, but the idea of many possible code paths causing a client to be disconnected is probably a sign of high coupling.
Have you looked into Mock Objects?
Why yes, of course, good sir/madam!
&gt; Jakarta Struts is good to look at. Unless they asked for it, I would consider Struts to be old crap not worth looking at.
Depending on what they are doing, you might do good to take a look at the [MVC pattern and how to use it with JSP](http://www.jansipke.nl/model-view-controller-mvc-with-jsp-and-jstl).
I don't have any specific resources for you (except I know that [JGAP](http://jgap.sourceforge.net/) is supposedly a good example), one of my favorite parts of TDD is detection of errors far down the line in a continuous integration framework. I've had multiple times where a change one place in our project broke something that we never (or at least not for a while) would have realized, and only discovered due to TDD. Having good JUnit tests allowed me to pinpoint the exact piece of code that was failing, fix it, and have confidence that the fix worked.
What would you say? JavaServer Faces? Custom Tag libraries? It's been my experience that most jobs are at least some "maintaining old crap".
I second this. Also look into some competing/complementing technologies such as JSF. 
I wouldn't really recommend Java Server Faces, although it clearly can't hurt to to know it. Since this post was about JSP, I would suggest using a MVC controller library like Spring MVC using [JSTL / JSP 2.0 tag file based JSP templates](http://fforw.de/post/creating-jsp-layouts-with-page-tags/). Simple, clean controller-based templating clearly separating layout aspects from view content. As I said, this all depends on what the company he interviews at is doing. If they're doing JSP like PHP in Java, I wouldn't bother even mentioning better structural approaches. If they do anything like this it's certainly good to roughly know how this works.
Yeah I can understand the benefits of testing and having a test suite but I was thinking more along the lines of ttd. For example how do I write a test up front for an interface where I have only one public method? How can I drive its design through tdd. Also what would I do in a situation where I know the design up front is tdd even possible? 
Article doesn't load for me. Anyone else having problems ?
Its a flash video, hosted from parleys.com
I've only gotten 5 minutes into it, I'll have to finish it later. I will say that I am guilty of Service s = new ServiceImpl(). Saying we don't need the interface is interesting and true, but I've stuck with that pattern for so long w/o thinking about why. I've never extended a service interface more than once.
Have you read Kent Beck's TDD book?
&gt;For example how do I write a test up front for an interface where I have only one public method? For me, I start off with answering the question "What is the simplest input that this class will receive?" Most of the time the answer to that question is "null" or "an empty collection", or something similar. I write a test for what the expected output is given that input. When that test fails, I move on to something slightly more complicated. If the interface takes a single integer as a parameter, fairly common tests that I would write would be with -1, 0, 1, MAX_VALID_INPUT, MIN_VALID_INPUT, MAX_VALID_INPUT + 1, MIN_VALID_INPUT - 1. After writing each tests, I see that it fails, write the minimum amount of code to get it to pass, and then move onto the next one. &gt; How can I drive its design through tdd. The book answer is simply that if your tests become hard to write, then your class under test is trying to do too much. You should refactor. This is somewhat of a major disconnect from the average coding style that I've seen in non-tdd shops. Your average class written by someone practicing TDD will often be made up of 3-5 methods of 1-5 lines a piece. It is somewhat hard to get into the mindset of having hundreds (and sometimes thousands) of very very small objects that satisfy the law of demeter rather than than very large objects that do lots of different things. 
No but I will have a look for it. Thanks 
I tend to refactor all my large methods but I will break out multiple smaller private methods. These then become a pain to test but exposing them means that I'm allowing other code to become dependent on my implementation. Its the same when creating new classes. I want to decouple my classes from their implementation which can help me change data structures for example without any external dependencies. Of course the single responsibility principle still applies. 
Set the dialog to modal, and the help window need to be opened as a separate process. How the two interact can be handled through "message passing" between the separate processes.
What kind of a dashboard?
It's a stand alone dashboard, that will store user input into a DB2 database. I've been using google to try and find some kind of tutorials, but none seem to be useful for what I am trying to accomplish.
I have been going onto big university sites and getting all their course material to learn java. I am reading through BU and am going to watch the videos on Stanfords website next.
let's say i have something like this: Class A { public publicMethod1() { ... } public publicMethod2() { privateMethod1(); privateMethod2(); } private privateMethod1() { ... } private privateMethod2() { ... } } I can write tests for publicMethod1 and 2 with no problem. But as publicMethod2 strongly depends on the results from privateMethod1 and 2 the more interessting test would be for privateMethod1 and 2. But how to I write tests for those? They are private and i can't just call them in my tests...
I am not gonna give you the answer. Sorry, but here, this should teach you that plus more if you do the exercises. http://codingbat.com/java
Maybe a good starting point would be to get a [Hello World Java Web Application in Eclipse](http://obscuredclarity.blogspot.com/2009/11/hello-world-java-web-application-in.html) up and running. (Yes that's my blog). For DB access, you should use a persistence layer library that's already out there. I use [Yank](http://xeiam.com/yank.jsp). You could also check out [XChart](http://xeiam.com/xchart.jsp) for a very simple solution to adding line charts in your webapp. (Yes, also my website.) I would imagine for a dashboard, you'll absolutely need AJAX and reverse-AJAX, the latter of which has become much more straightforward to implement since Servlet 3.0. Good luck!
To me, a dashboard is software that displays an overview of data, not stores it... could you be more specific?
here is an opposite view (from another random guy): http://teddziuba.com/2011/10/node-js-is-cancer.html
You will need ~~~this~~~ [EDIT: Whops, Google tricked me. Surprisingly difficult to retrieve a list of Array methods. Are you using Eclipse?] Slowly go through the text of the problem and write down an itemized list of all the concepts used. Then make a drawing of how they relate to each other (according to your understanding of the text) and work from there.
Congratulations on creating a framework for one that already exists and is widely accepted. The person who write about Spring does not understand the full capabilities. 
No need to be sorry, as I said any kind of help is appreciated.
Thing is though I don't know where to go after that text, heck I'm not even sure if that text is right.
Wait, isn't this backwards?
exactly!
Nice article. Spring was great when it was developed but it seems to solve a problem that no longer exists. 
Yeah as soon as I saw that it was server side code written in fucking Javascript, I closed the OP's article. The only way this could be made worse would be to write the HTTP server in Node.js, which opens a 10k line configuration file in highly verbose XML.
I don't know about that ... I find that some stuff in the Spring world is just more flexible than in the "Pure EE" world. One thing that comes to mind is how easy it to pretty much test an entire application outside of the container (i.e., wire in an in-memory db, and even fire up the embedded version of Jetty to simulate http failures if your application needs to talk to webservices). When it comes to the actual production code, then I guess the code that is deployed would look pretty similar these days. IMHO it's the testing stuff that really adds value. 
Java EE has the same testing options now. EJB is fully embeddable and projects like Arquillian make the whole thing even easier.
By the same token, instead of creating a framework for one that already existed, Springsource could have helped to improve J2EE back then. The Hibernate community did that. A lot of members of the Apache community did that. Why couldn't Springsource do it? Is is maybe because Rod is not the benevolent dictator our there to better Java, but is just there to make a buck?
That does indeed look quite a lot like the setup I usually prefer with spring. However, one nice thing about spring is that you can do that without any kind of container. You can add the same functionality the container provides if you need them. If you aren't using distributed transactions, then you can skip JTA. Suddenly need to add a new datasource and need distributed transactions? Add in Atomikos, etc ... On the other hand, I guess starting up a container probably adds the same overhead as creating the equivalent spring context :) 
&gt;However, one nice thing about spring is that you can do that without any kind of container. But guess where springbeans are managed? Isn't this called the Spring **Container**? See e.g wikipedia among many sources: "*The Spring container provides a consistent mechanism to configure applications and integrates with almost all Java environments, from small-scale applications to large enterprise applications.*" &gt;I guess starting up a container probably adds the same overhead as creating the equivalent spring context Glassfish 3 and JBoss AS 7 start up the entire AS in 2 to 3 seconds, deploying EJBs after that is in the millisecond range. Deploying lots of EJBs does add to the startup time. It used to be worse though. JBoss AS 6 for instance is notorious, easily taking a full minute for an application with a few dozen EJB beans and also a few dozen annotated JPA entities. But the Spring Container can take a long time to start too, especially when using AOP extensively. I've seen moderately complex Spring 3 application easily take 45 or more seconds and it got worse when more springbeans were added. I haven't tried Spring 3.1 yet, so I don't know if it can match the latest Java EE offerings in startup speed now.
...yes, that is a webpage of APIs.
Ted's blog post was basically inflammatory linkbait
Node doesn't have a core ability to read XML. Implementing an HTTP server in Node is 5 lines or so of code.
WTF is going on. First it was, J2EE to Spring. Now it is Spring to J2EE. Oh man.
Just out of curiosity, how does one manage to create an application that takes 45 seconds to create the ApplicationContext? That sounds like a monster :) For the modules that I've had both the pleasure and displeasure of working with the ApplicationContext could be created in less than a second. A couple of questions since you seem quite knowledgeable about testing with a pure EJB setup: - Is there some equivalent @DirtiesContext if I go pure EE? - If I want to wire in stuff that's not normally part of the container, like an extremely thin mock implementation of a foreign webservice (just to test our handling of http errors). Ideally I'd want that to be able to access my EJBs/MDBs as well (although I guess that's probably not strictly necessary). 
You are slightly mistaken. It was J2EE to Spring and now it is Spring to Java EE. Both are good frameworks and for us as developers it's good that there's healthy competition between them. Personally I think Java EE is a little ahead of Spring these days. When Spring 3.1 goes final, Spring may be a little ahead again, but then shortly after Java EE 7 will arrive and I'm pretty sure it will be ahead of Spring 3.1. Don't you just love the competition? :)
Have you tried using [CCleaner](http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner) and use it to clean out the registry? Do it several times, even if it takes a while so it can get each layer of invalid references and keep doing it until it basically turns up empty. Also running the regular cleaner will free up a fair amount of space and remove odd crap from browsers, etc. that most people have on their machines. Most browsers will start and operate faster after this, though you may have to re-login to sites, etc. which isn't a bad thing. Anyway, once you've cleaned things up a bit, try installing Java again and see how it goes. 
I tried doing that, but it still doesn't work. My computer still tries to uninstall java, with the same error. Thanks for the response though.
Which part am I mistaken on?
Your private methods should (and are in this example) be called by public methods, and thus tested through that. Ultimately we want to be testing behavior, not implementation. How you get there is relatively unimportant, it's that you get there.
Reformat hard drive
You can also try running the Java uninstaller from inside CCleaner using the Tools | Uninstall window. Then try the 'Run Uninstaller' button to see if it can run it. That will probably fail. If you're feeling adventurous after it fails, you can try the 'Delete Entry' button. This will just outright delete the package from the list of installed packages; it just won't actually run the uninstaller. Then you try the registry cleanup procedure again and repeat that until it's clean. Then maybe try installing again. Barring all that, I would have to run the installer again with Process Monitor and/or RegMon and/or FileMon to see where it's going wrong. Really badly behaved installers can be corrected with manual intervention once you know where they're jumping the shark. And this isn't something I can really help you with here; but I hope this is giving you enough raw material to sort it out on your own.
J2EE != Java EE
Install Linux.
is it in the recycle bin by any chance?
Get the error "Can not remove MSI installer" when I try to remove the file. Going to try that process monitor thingy later, and if that doesn't work I'll contact java support.
Would be funny if that was the problem. I don't think it checks the recycle bin when refreshing though.
I deleted all java files I could find, JAVA_HOME included. EDIT: Holy crap, installing a different version worked! Thank you very much!
What is the distinction, now? I thought JEE was the new name used but they point to the same thing.
ok, because you are the first person on earth to ask this question. there's this thing called google, dunno if you've heard of it.
I mean the files you deleted...if you could restore from recycle bin, you could uninstall java?
Should've had buttons for Abort / Continue / Ok. That would've been icing on the cake. Also, attention programmers: make sure your error handling classes are simple and failure-proof!! If you're using some complex, 0.5-beta framework for your error handling and logging, you end up with crap like this.
One word: Scope

This is actually a pretty informative error message.
Read "Head First Java", should get you started
You don't require any "beans", All you need in JSP for UI, servlet for back end and JDBC for database connectivity.
As someone who is still new to Java one word is not enough i am afraid.
It's the name for the new versions. J2EE (old versions) can be summarized as "EJB XML hell" while JEE (recent versions) can be summarized as "full of annotations that are reportedly rather nice". I don't have much experience with JEE, so I'll let other expand on that (and probably correct it).
Agreed, or even a timer counting down before the OK button becomes enabled, along with a checkbox.
Yeah, that would be smart, but I've emptied it a while ago
Try something like this... public static void gradecalc(float percentage) { { // Remove the input statements if (grade &gt;= 70) { ... } } public static void percentageCalculator() { ... gradecalc(percentage); } 
Patiently waiting for the Scumbag Eclipse Meme
Netbeans would have just swallowed the error and functions would just stop working.
Function Reddit has quit working while quitting reddit. Quitting reddit may cause reddit to close. Would you like to close reddit?
i have it working now but thanks for the help.
and just after closing reddit: ctrl+t --&gt; reddit.com
What is the fix in case someone (like me who is new) is trying to fix your code and wants to make sure I got the right answer :P. I was betting on: "grade = percentage;" being the issue since grade is not local and must be called by gradecalc.grade = percentage instead. right?
It displays a nice blinking red icon
Hi there, BlueJ is a good learning environment with it's own simple debugger and pseudo-UML visualiser. The next step up is a "real" IDE (Integrated Development Environment - graphical editor) like Eclipse or Netbeans. These are arguably the two most popular Java IDEs. They have more features, and are more complex. 
Thanks a lot this is exactly what I was looking for. 
I curse eclipse every day.
Eclipse is the best IMO.
netbeans and eclipse have both pros and cons... netbeans is created and maintained by Oracle. You get a pretty uniform platform with several features, but, the ability to customize that platform comes with some limitations. Eclipse on the other hand is an open source platform for which there are many plugins from different developers and communities that may not always play nice together. I have worked on both... my personal preference is Netbeans for the consistency in the architecture... however... the plugins that are available for eclipse provide a wider toolset. edit: Sun is now Oracle
http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html See section for "double". "As mentioned above, this data type should never be used for precise values, such as currency." 
I have been writing and collecting some relevant stuff [here](http://www.javagyan.com) and there is separate section for [Interview preparation](http://www.javagyan.com/preparing-for-an-interview)
[I posted this a while ago.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/dzjex/yo_dawg_i_hear_theres_an_error_inside_your_error/)
BlueJ is based on netbeans and you can even import your blueJ projects, so give netbeans a try
be sure to try a few IDEs, dont stick to the first :) http://www.netbeans.org http://www.eclipse.org http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ (no particular order)
Beanshell is an ok. I personally would rather use a language built for scripting.
There's the free version of IntelliJ [Community Edition](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/free_java_ide.html). Personally I prefer this (well, the paid version) over Eclipse &amp; Netbeans.
inside percentageCalculator i have gradecalc(percentage); and then for grade calc it has been changed to public static void gradecalc(floatgrade) { } As for your solution i may have worked but i think there may have been some issues with the methods being static but, i am not too sure. 
I'm actually working with RAD 8.0. I tried to install the Android SDK, and it ruined my WAS 6.1 instance. I had to remove WAS 6.1 all together and reinstall it. That's when I finally got that pop up message
so, who won ?
i recommend [Netbeans](http://netbeans.org/), but there is also [Eclipse](http://netbeans.org/). Both of these are free software.
A bit more info at dzone: http://java.dzone.com/news/apache-harmony-finally
I had a similar issue. I had been working in matlab and you can create data structures, and add fields to it whenever you want. But with java, you can't. I ended up opting to create a new object that contained the 5 data values that I needed. It seemed to simplify things for my application. I tested out if there was a performance/memory cost from one over the other, and I didn't really see a noticeable difference between the two. NOTE: I'm relatively new to java (1.5 years), so if I am wrong about something please correct me.
Honestly...you're the first person I've heard of use their framework. But seems like Oracle has some docs on it. http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/adf/overview/index.html. But whenever I'm trying to learn something new, I do some searches on Stackoverflow.com. Hope this is somewhat helpful.
Good riddance.
yep; stack is also my place to go, but alas, even in the workplace there are few people familiar with the framework. But fortunately I've already gotten close with one or two of the ones who know, and they're guiding me. thank you so much for your feedback!
Check out the HashMap library. You can arbitrarily add values (with an arbitrary key to uniquely identify it). ArrayList is great if you want to iterate in order, but HashMap is great if you just want to .put(Object). 
I think you've got at least one error in there. Why not break out the compiler and actually give this a shot?
It is better to have one array holding objects. This groups your variables into one object. This allows you to add methods to your object that have access to all the variables associated with that instance. If you split the object into multiple arrays of variables, you lose the ability to encapsulate your methods and data. Read [Encapsulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_%28object-oriented_programming%29). It is true either way would work, but I guarantee you will run into issues using a bunch of arrays.
yeah I can see possible or definite issues in the first 3.
It depends. The data construct needs to match the usage. A List is good when the number of objects is unknown and order is important. An array is good if the size rarely changes and you want fast access. A Map is good if you want to store something based on another object, the two being related. A Set is good for collecting objects without ordering being as important.
None taken. I would fail myself too, I have made it this far into the semester without completing a single assignment or lab without copious amounts of help from my professor and I still have a mid B without my lowest test grade taken out. But there wont be a next semester for me, I've learned this semester computer systems engineering is not the major for me. I still want to learn Java so I'll likely purchase my own tutorial kind of book because I'm a very example oriented person and the way this course is being taught, does not meet my needs. Anyways thanks for the help.
Also, it would be even better to use a List to hold the objects instead of an array. A list can grown in size as needed and has much more functionality than an array. 
Here is an untested example that kind of demonstrates how clumsy arrays can be. public class GoodWay { public static class Person { String fistName; String lastName; String address; public Person(String aFirstName, String aLastName, String anAddress) { super(); this.firstName = aFirstName; this.lastName = aLastName; this.address = anAddress; } public String fullName() { return lastName + ", " + firstName; } } public static List&lt;People&gt; people = new ArrayList&lt;People&gt;(); public static void main(String[] args) { people.add(new Person("John","Doe","456 Grand St")); people.add(new Person("Frank","Furter","234 Java St")); people.add(new Person("Jane","Doe","123 Main St")); for (Person p : people) { System.out.println(p.fullName()); } } public class BadWay { public static String[] firstNames = new Array[3]; public static String[] lastNames = new Array[3]; public static String[] addresses = new Array[3]; public static String fullName(String lastName, String firstName) { return lastName + ", " + firstName; } public static void main(String[] args) { firstNames[0] = "John"; lastNames[0] = "Doe"; addresses[0] = "456 Grand St"; firstNames[1] = "Frank"; lastNames[1] = "Furter"; addresses[1] = "234 Java St"; firstNames[2] = "Jane"; lastNames[2] = "Doe"; addresses[2] = "123 Main St"; for (int i = 0 ; i &lt; 3 ; i++ ) { System.out.println(fullName(firstNames[i],lastNames[i]); } } 
No. Just no no no .. 
Why?
Generally you want an array of objects, BUT the group of arrays technique can be helpful if you are pressed for memory or if you tend to work with one field at a time (averaging the age field or whatever). As I say, to best "think in Java", you should have an array of objects, since that will afford you the most flexibility when it comes to changes to the requirements or design.
I never saw the point of it, and it created a lot of unnecessary drama in the Java community.
This appears to compile to Java code (not bytecode) meaning I can use it in my job and *no one ever has to know.* :D
So... They made a shitty clone of groovy? Awesome guys :/
So I've been working in this area for my PhD thesis, and yeah, Xtext is pretty damn awesome. You shouldn't need to serialise domain-specific files at all anymore.
`val List&lt;String&gt; names = getTheListOfNames()` This doesn't even make sense. I think it'd have been something like; `val List&lt;?&gt; names = getTheListOfNames()`
Is this language supposed to replace the functional Xtend language in Xpand?
&gt; Xtext is pretty damn awesome Really? I read the overview on the linked page, and nothing particularly blew my skirt up. I personally see the removal of the type declaration a negative -- I want to see that stuff at a glance. The fact you can write foo.name rather than foo.getName() doesn't excite me. Optional parenthesis and semicolons - nothing award winning there. They do closures - ok, there's a positive. So, er, and I mean this with all sincerity - what's all the excitement about?
The customer has an ERP system with four overlapping tables: customers, suppliers, employees, and companies. (The last has companies within the corporate group, roughly 100.) Employees appear as customers, customers are also suppliers, companies are both customers and suppliers, etc. There are also duplicates within each table. This engine let us automatically monitor the database and maintain a separate database of sameAs links. The next step is to add in the CRM system, which has even more duplicates. One of the most fun things I've done in my programming career. :-)
Don't you share your code in some kind of repository ? What if somebody else modifies the produced java : how will you manage that ?
As is fairly typical with Eclipse, the quickstart documentation here is terrible, and at least if my experience is anything to go by, it doesn't work. Basically we get a single sentence to explain how to install it: &gt; To install the Xtend plugins open the update manager and paste one of the URLs on the right into the field 'Work with' and select the Xtend SDK And yet somehow they even managed to get this wrong, there is no "Xtend SDK" listed. There is however an "Xtend2 SDK", I assumed that was what they meant. So I install this, and now what? Yes there is the tutorial, but what I really want to do is create my own XTend project and play around. But guess what, no instructions on how to do this! So I'll assume, since XTend compiles to Java, that I need to create a Java project, which I do. Then I go to "New" -&gt; "Other..." -&gt; "Xtend Class", and create a class. It offers to add the "Xtend Nature" to the project, I agree. I get my .xtend file, but of course its got an error: &gt; Mandatory library bundle 'org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.lib' not found on the classpath. So WTF am I supposed to do now? I guess I need to add some stuff to the build path, but what do I add? Ok, I'll install the Example project and look at its build path. Ok, so its got something called "Plug-in Dependencies" which appears to contain the missing libraries, so how do I add this to my own project? I go to "Add Library" and there I see it, "Plug-in Dependencies", ok, I'll add that. But does this solve the problem? No! The Plug-in Dependencies library I just added is empty! So this wonderful language that is supposed to make Java easier to use, is apparently unusable, even by an experienced Java and Eclipse user. This is so typical of eclipse, they create really cool stuff and then totally ruin it by treating the introductory documentation as an afterthought. Incidentally, the [Xtext website](http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/) is also a perfect example of this. I know nothing about XText, and having looked at the front page of the XText website, its "At a Glance" section, I *still* no nothing about XText, because *at no point do they explain what XText is!*
It will probably be the best thing in the world when it emerges, and then, bit by bit, each version will be less and less compatible with the previous, and each of the plugins will introduce new problems, and finally, your installation won't work, and will take 3/4 of a gig of RAM to make a "Hello World".
Yet another Scala wannabe ...
It would be cooler if the JVM allowed this, so languages would be inter-operable instead of every language inventing its own class-passing scheme.
Why?
Even if the JVM would add support, it wouldn't necessarily mean Java would support it too. Java reached its end of life. Use a better language to go forward.
Obviously he just blows away their changes each time he checks in. Just like he does now. Duh.
Look in Tomcat's log directory. You'll see a bunch of files. Start with catalina.out and look for stack traces.
Also, open up the web.xml file and comment out any &lt;error-page&gt; xml snippets and re-deploy. This way, the stack traces that may not show up in tomcat's log files will appear in the browser. That's where the custom error page you're talking about is configured.
You don't want to be querying a view to find out data on the model. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller I'm a big fan of the observer pattern as used by swings listener model. However I'm not quite clear on what you are intending to do with it. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern
You're not debugging Tomcat, but the web application itself. You real question should be "How do I debug a Java web application?". ;-) While looking at catalina.out is a good first step (this is where the stdout of web applications go), a properly designed web application will *not* write anything to stdout, instead using logging frameworks such as SLF4J, Commons Logging, Log4j, Logback, java.util.logging, etc. These can be configured to put their logs anywhere, in many files (even in databases, or over the network), and their configurations files vary... If you can ask the original developer about that, or anyone who maintained the application, you'll gain a lot of time. In order to find the log files, one way to investigate the problem is to look for any file open or recently modified after you run Tomcat. Tools such as [Process Explorer](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653) can help you look at what files are open while Tomcat is running (search for logs/\* or \*.log or \*.out), tools such as [GNU Find](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/findutils.htm) can help you find which files were last modified a few minutes ago (with a command-line such as `find . -mmin -10` to find files under the current directory modified less than 10 minutes ago). As far as log configuration files go, have a look inside the webapps directory. This is where web applications are typically installed, either in a war file (which is just a renamed zip file with a standard directory hierarchy inside), or in a directory (the result of unzipping the war file). Search for files named log4j.xml, log4j.properties, logging.properties, logback.xml, and see if you can find some file name (or file name patterns) in there; this should give you a clue of where to find the files. Also, if you see any kind of "level" setting in those configuration files, set it to "DEBUG" to markedly increase the amount of logging of the relevant item (provided the programmer of the web application was sensible enough to include debug statements in his or her code...). Since things work with the old database, and fail with the new one, consider investigating the logging abilities of the local (new) database. Maybe you'll get a strong clue this way (such as missing table, incorrect user, etc. :-)) Finally, if you have the source code and access to a Java programmer, you can remotely debug a web application inside Tomcat from Eclipse. To start Tomcat in "remote debug" mode, go in the bin directory and use the following command-line : `catalina.bat jpda start`, and then configure your debugger to connect to port 8000, and you can debug at will (if you don't want to use port 8000, or if it is already used by something else, set the JPDA_ADDRESS environment variable to the port number you want).
How about keeping a variable that stores the number of moves left and decrement it every time the player makes a move. Implement your standard getter and you're done.
As a rule nothing should be done in the getter it ought to just return a value, so it shouldn't be performing any calculations. So something like: public String getName() { return name; } 
I think I'm gonna give this one a go, ill just have to use some if else loops for when the answer is either wrong or right. thanks for the advice!
They just aren't ready to go full Scala.
Ecurse?
thanks for the lengthy explanation. Using information gathered from the catalina log (I had been distracted by red herrings in all the other logs) I deduced that the client was basically bullshitting me when they said it would run on slq2008. I built another server to test a few different configs Here's where I'm at. Tomcat7 (newserver A) + sql2005 (old server) = OK Tomcat5.5 (newserver B) + sql2005 (newserver B) = OK tomcat7 (newserver A) + sql2005 (newserver B) = not OK connecting with tomcat7 to the new installation of 2005 gives errors telling me to use sqljdbc4.jar. I've found a lot of confusing information about how you're actually supposed to use the damn thing but nothing makes a difference to the error. I've read enough to make me suspect that they have a reference to the sqljdbc.jar buried somewhere in their code so I'm thinking fuckit, they're staying on tomcat5, the server has been rebuilt, they don't need a software upgrade as well 
So the tutorial you skipped, that lets face it probably explained how to make a project, was that awful too?, oh wait....
FWIW, to make proper use of XText, you should know basic compiler theory (e.g. context-free grammars, EBNF, etc.). If you do know all that, then the most straightforward explanation of what XText is is that XText takes a grammar as input, and generates an Eclipse editor with syntax highlighting and auto-completion for you. In other words, XText is a great tool for designing your own programming language and to add support for that language in Eclipse.
I guess you mean XTend? Because there *is* also an Eclipse product called XText, but it's not related to the article posted.
It's probably closer to Scala than Groovy, if my impression of where XTend lies on the dynamic-static spectrum is accurate.
Not sure I understand your criticism. Both `List&lt;String&gt; names = getTheListOfNames()` and `List&lt;?&gt; names = getTheListOfNames()` would be valid in plain-old-Java, right? What this language adds above and beyond java is type-inference, in the sense that the compiler is able to determine the type of the expression `getTheListOfNames()`, and thus it could infer that you intend the type of the variable "names" to be exactly the same as the type of the expression you're assigning to it, thus the new language allows you to just write `val names = getTheListOfNames()`.
Try updating the JDBC driver jar.
JDBC is the Java standard to access databases. Vendors ship JDBC drivers (typically in Jar files), and then two things need to be done: * The Jar file must be put in the classpath of the program (plenty of possible mistakes here, and plenty of room for confusing, plain bad, or outdated info; here you really want to get info specific to your version of Tomcat; ignore all the rest) * The program must call the proper class file (rarely hard-coded, most often given in a property file somewhere; but anything is possible really) Apparently in the SQL Server case, there are [two drivers](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms378422.aspx) available: * sqljdbc.jar which supports JDBC 3.0 and Java 5 only * sqljdbc4.jar which supports JDBC 4.0 and Java 6 and later versions Both should work on SQL Server 2000, 2005, and 2008. So, what you can do is search in the Tomcat7 installation for those two files and see if there is a possible conflict (sqljdbc.jar being there while you use Java 6 for example). Ideally there should be precisely one copy of one of the two files, period. If you find sqljdbc.jar, you could try replacing it with sqljdbc4.jar. The class that [should be used by the web application](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms378526.aspx) is: com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver. You can search for this string in the files in the Tomcat folder to have an idea of what file configures the database. But really, the fact that Tomcat7 (newserver A) can talk to sql2005 (old server) shows that everything appears to be fine on Tomcat7 as far as JDBC driver installation is concerned. The fact that it works with sql2005 (old server) and not with sql2005 (newserver B) hints strongly at a configuration issue on newserver B. Are you sure these are the same version, with the same settings? The most typical configuration problem would be an incorrect username and/or password. Typically, in the property or XML file where you find "com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver", you should also find settings for the username and password to use, on lines near the one where you configure the driver class to use.
I'm new but dont you need some sorta random number? in python its somthing like x = random.number(1, 6) and it will give you a random number between 1 - 6 
Oh wait, hang on, I just noticed the whole code wasn't pasted! I shall edit now, thank you Sir.
What is your question, exactly? When doing your comparisons, the integer `userdice` is never declared or assigned a value. Do you mean to use `user` instead? 
I didn't skip it, and no, I'm fairly sure it didn't. It was just a collection of example files which were already set-up as a project.
Right, and why couldn't they explain that on the website?
Shouldn't you win only when your number matches the computer's number? If your number is greater you would display something like too high, otherwise too low.
Except Scala's Eclipse support remains rather flakey.
Sorry, I should have clarified a bit better. I suppose my question is how to take the input from the user to allow them to type in a number between 1 - 6 and then have the computer roll a random number between 1 - 6 and tell the user who wins. I've already done one where it just rolls a random number for both user and computer then tells you who won but I just can't figure this one out. I'm a JAVA virgin.
That makes way more sense! So how do I get it to take the user's number and compare it to the random computer generated one? I know how to declare a winner but I just can't figure out the other part.
I haven't tried compiling or running your code, but what problem are you having with it? Does it not compile? If not, what error is it giving? When it runs, are you getting unexpected behavior? Answering these sorts of questions will allow us help you better. Another problem I noticed is that you do: user = keyboard.nextInt(); But there is never a `keyboard` object declared. You probably mean to use your Scanner object, `input`: user = input.nextInt(); 
I don't know. It's been a long time since I last looked at XText, and it seemed fairly well explained to me at the time.
You use == to check if two values are the same. Alternatively you can use != to check if two values are not the same.
Well you are already performing comparison checking for equality is done via the == operator.
Thank you!!! I was getting 1 compiling error and it was the keyboard one. I made some minor changes and it now works. Thank you!
Ok, here's my result after using the awesome power of redditor feedback! It compiles and runs. We were asked by the tutor to use dice even though the user is just picking a number between 1-6 in a game of chance so I apologise for the confusion. I will also look into using the do/whiles that Glazun mentioned because that sounds cool. Thank you all for the help, I was stuck on this for the last 2 hours! /** * @(#)dice.java * * ask the user to guess a number between 1 and 6 * roll a dice for the computer * tell the user who wins * @author * @version 1.00 2011/10/25 */ import java.util.Scanner; //needed for taking inputs public class dice { public static void main(String args[]) { //needed for inputs Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); //declare variables int user; //user inputs number between 1-6 int compdice; //computer dice //get the number entered by the user System.out.print("Enter a number between 1 and 6. "); user = input.nextInt(); //roll the dice to generate a random number from 1-6 compdice = 1+ (int) (Math.random()*6); //display computer roll System.out.println("You chose the number " + user); System.out.println("Computer rolled a " + compdice); //check who wins if(user == compdice) { System.out.println("You win!"); } else { System.out.println("You lose."); } }//end main method }//end class
Go to the website and show me where it explains what XText is - if you can't find a simple explanation don't you think that is a problem?
Yar, if you went the do/while root you could just implement using do{ //get user input if(user != compdice){ //try again } while(user != compdice); Then once the user guesses the right answer it'll break out of the do while and go into the next line of code after the do while, there you could just put in a "You Won" or whatever. It can be tricky to pick up concepts at the start, but once they sink in you'll have them forever. 
I currently work for the New York State Senate. We have 62 CRM instances running CiviCRM with our own layer built on top of it.. one of the biggest issues we run in to is contact duplication, and while a member of our team has done a tremendous amount of work to resolve those issues we currently have an intern using your project (Duke) to do testing and break the ice to see where it can fit in. Glad you were able to open source it, keep up the good work :)
Yeah, I guess it's a problem, but it doesn't really affect me, so I don't care enough to do anything about it.
Yup, and its developers probably feel the same way which is the reason for this problem.
I thought it was something up with the sql installation but tomcat5 (on serverB) can connect to the DB on serverB and oldserver but not serverA, wheras tomcat7 (on serverA) can only connect to the DB on oldserver and nothing can connect to the DB on serverA. I found the class that you referred to. It's not the password as all 3 servers are using the exact same connectionstring.jsp (only the ip of the DB server is changing). They're all on java 6. I've found a few versions of sqljdbc.jar and sqljdbc4.jar and tried them all in /tomcat7/lib (restarting tomcat with each change) and I get this every time 06-Nov-2011 02:08:00 com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerConnection &lt;init&gt; SEVERE: Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.6 is not supported by this driver. Use the sqljdbc4.jar class library, which provides support for JDBC 4.0. 06-Nov-2011 02:08:00 org.apache.catalina.core.StandardWrapperValve invoke SEVERE: Servlet.service() for servlet [jsp] in context with path [] threw exception [java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.6 is not supported by this driver. Use the sqljdbc4.jar class library, which provides support for JDBC 4.0.] with root cause java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.6 is not supported by this driver. Use the sqljdbc4.jar class library, which provides support for JDBC 4.0. now that I've gone through every version of both jars I could find, I'm wondering if that's even the right bloody directory. On the servers that work, it's in tomcat5.5/shared/lib but there is no shared folder in tomcat7
Scala again, I don't understand why everybody is trying to get their own language out, instead of contributing to a common language (i.e. java in case of eclipse). Contribution will help the language become more user friendly and reduce the learning curve.
&gt; fuckit, they're staying on tomcat5, the server has been rebuilt, they don't need a software upgrade as well This is probably your best option TBH.
If you're going to try to debug a web app through Eclipse, may I recommend the [Sysdeo Eclipse Tomcat Launcher plugin](http://www.eclipsetotale.com/tomcatPlugin.html). Pretty much does what you'd expect: launches Tomcat from Eclipse, loads your code, and attaches Eclipse to Tomcat as a debugger. It's more suited to a development environment rather than your production box, though.
Do you care about the problem?
So the core error message is: &gt; Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.6 is not supported by this driver. Use the sqljdbc4.jar class library, which provides support for JDBC 4.0. Pretty explicit now that we know what I posted above. I do not understand why you do not get the message when connecting to sql2005 (old server). It should purely be a client-side message. Why it varies according to the server is a real puzzler. &gt; I'm wondering if that's even the right bloody directory That is indeed the correct question. :-) More about that below. &gt; it's in tomcat5.5/shared/lib but there is no shared folder in tomcat7 They simplified the directory layout starting in Tomcat 6. That's why I said you need instructions specific to your version of Tomcat. :-) There's still plenty of outdated info for Tomcat 5 (or even Tomcat 4, Tomcat 3...) out there. According to the [Tomcat 7 Class Loading Reference](http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/class-loader-howto.html), from the point of view of a web application, the following locations are tried in this order when looking for a class: * Bootstrap classes of the JVM (standard JRE Jars, plus any Jar found in `%JAVA_HOME%\jre\lib\ext`) * System class loader classes (a few hard-coded Tomcat Jars) * `WEB-INF\classes` of the web application (not for Jars, just individual, unpacked classes) * `WEB-INF\lib` of the web application * `%CATALINA_BASE%\lib` (lib directory of the Tomcat instance) * `%CATALINA_HOME%\lib` (lib directory of the Tomcat install) The last two items are actually configured in `conf\catalina.properties`, but if you installed Tomcat yourself, you probably didn't change that file. By the way, Tomcat has the ability to have several instances with a single install, but by default `CATALINA_BASE` and `CATALINA_HOME` are the same. *As you can see, if the driver ships as part of the web application, it will override any similar Jar placed in the Tomcat `lib` directory.* So, you should verify: * `C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\lib\ext` or `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_29\jre\lib\ext` (or wherever it is that you installed Java) * The `WEB-INF\lib` directory inside your web application * The `lib` directory in your Tomcat installation Note that the `lib` directory of the web application can either be visible as a subdirectory under `webapps\&lt;your_app_name&gt;` or inside `webapps\&lt;your_app_name&gt;.war` (which is a zip file). If there is no `webapps\&lt;your_app_name&gt;` directory, but just the war file, you can actually unzip it in `webapps` (preserving the directory structure) and change the Jar files in `WEB-INF\lib`. If this fails for some reason, you can also unzip the file someplace else, make the change, re-zip it and put it back in `webapps`. You should restart Tomcat after making such changes. Normally it picks up changes in `webapps` and redeploys automatically, but there can be subtle issues with that.
Wow. :) Great to hear you're using the software. Let me know if I can do anything to help.
Looks too much like Groovy to me.
Still has the best support out there except Java itself. Considering that the Scala core team assumed responsibility for it not long ago and the improvements made in that time, I have no fear that it will keep getting better and better.
Only in that I'd like to be able to see if this language is interesting, and as it is I can't.
What error are you getting?
Well, my hope was that XTend might have solid support in Eclipse given that it is created by Eclipse themselves. Of course, since I can't get it working (see other comment) I guess I may never know :-/
It's statically typed, so closer to Scala than Groovy.
Wishful thinking. Java is the new COBOL.
People often think "some people from Eclipse doing their stuff" == "every Eclipse developer on earth now starts working on that feature". It is wrong.
send failed, exception: javax.mail.MessagingException: Could not connect to SMTP host: localhost, port: 25; nested exception is: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: connect
I guess in a sense Java is the new COBOL. At one time COBOL was the ubiquitous choice for enterprise software development. Now that's Java. I doubt that's what you or others mean though. I assume you mean that Java is irrelevant and has been effectively relegated to legacy systems and nothing new is being built using Java. I find it strange that people would take a position that is so easily disproved, but as the author of the post noted it's really just a mantra repeated by people who really don't know what they're talking about. 
I know this has been posted a few times in the past (2-5 years ago). Recent updates have brought on some really cool features and community projects.
Cool. That means in 30 years I'll still have a job. I wonder what's going to happen to C#. Seems to me it is going to have more legacy issues than Java due to it being so closely tied to IIS and Windows. What if Microsoft "Silverlights" it? With Java almost everything is Open Source so one company can't pull the plug.
If you are only going to make gravity it might be easier to just 'fake' it. You don't need a whole physics system to make a sprite move up and down. The sprite could jump at a certain rate to a certain height and then that value decays so the sprite falls back down at a certain rate.
It's possible that your ISP is blocking port 25. Many ISPs (e.g. Comcast) do this to prevent spam; they block outbound port 25 connections to any mail servers but their own. You can try port 587, which is the alternate SMTP port. If that doesn't work, contact your ISP and ask them to unblock port 25. Often times they will do this is you ask.
I also need to handle collisions, and since I have no clue how to do that without a physics engine, I figured phys2d would make things easier. And maybe i'll add more physics later on.
I never said that, nor do I think that.
I don't plan to make this into a language platform war. I certainly don't care about .NET. While C# is certainly nicer to use than Java, Java is nicer from a language design perspective because it hasn't grown into a kitchen sink language. This will probably change with Java 8 and 9.
Java-the-language has reached its end-of-life while Java-the-platform is just great. Targeting the JVM is a good decision but using `javac` to create the bytecode should get people fired for wasting company resources.
Can you explain your original comment? I assumed you were trolling.
I would really like to understand this too. 
I'm guessing he's referring to simple programmer productivity given all the boilerplate and lack of functional paradigms. While I don't entirely agree with him, I do agree that the time for the JVM has come, and there are much better alternatives than javac popping up.
Int port = 587 I assume thats the port.
Oh an by the way it still does not work with a working gmail user and password, I left it out for my own security.
I don't think anyone things Java is the new Cobol for the terseness or verbosity of the language (except maybe Ruby developers). I think its just the new language of choice for business applicaitons. At least, that's not what I get from it when I hear that "Java is the new COBOL". Then again, I've only heard the phrase, I haven't heard the real reasons for why people say that. If they are saying its because its got all the downsides to COBOL I'd disagree. It's a good thing Java is the new COBOL in that it serves the same purpose COBOL once did (developing reliable robust custom tailored business applications on multiple platforms in mid-large business environments), but the best part is its NOT COBOL. Seriously, try writing something in COBOL, no one is trying to say Java is as asinine to program for as COBOL (at least I hope not), I think they are only referring to it as the new de facto standard for writing business applications on the back end.
How much effort are you willing to put to get the information you want?
Are you kidding me? You must live under a rock.
No more than I've already expended. If they want people to use their language, it's up to them to make it somewhat accessible.
If you want to handle 2d collision, then you could just use the intersects() method of the java.awt.Rectangle and Polygon classes, which checked if a rectangle intersects another.. The you could just return a Rectangle that represents the sprites hitbox from either the Sprite/Image class(If you have one) or the Entity Class.
Thanks, I didn't know about this method, i'll try this tomorrow if I can find the time.
Java isn't a scripting language. :)
I'd really recommend using [MP3SPI](http://www.javazoom.net/mp3spi/mp3spi.html) instead of using JLayer directly. Using the SPI, you can switch to another codec much easier.
I'd recommend avoiding Applet and other JDK 1.0 relics.
So I realise this thread is a day old, and therefore essentially dead - but I wanted to ask you: do you write large real-world applications in Scala, and if so, what 2 or 3 things make Scala great. I look at new languages as they pop up, but my interest is only maintained if I can foresee how it would be better for building large complex systems. I personally look at things like Ruby's dynamic typing as a terrible curse. I want my type system checking done at compile time to catch bugs early. To me, coming from a background in C, Java is great because of garbage collection and large class library. It's OO done nicely enough. From a glance at Scala, Actors look like -- but I had expectations along the lines of Erlang and I've discovered that Actors just use JVM threads (so I can't have 10,000 actors). Closures and the like are neat - although I get by without them at the present time. I don't think they would transform my world. The absence of semi-colons and parenthesis is not a feature. Sure, you might not need them, but it's not a selling point. In fact, my brain is trained to use them to spot patterns and perform my own parsing. So - what do you think?
 // my twisted sense of humor /joke public class Cobol { public static void main(String[] arg) { Cobol theNewCobol = new Cobol(); // Java the new Cobol } public Cobol() { System.out.println("The New Cobol!"); } } 
&gt; Connection refused: connect This means that the TCP connection could not be established. This should not be a Java problem. Try the following command in a Command Prompt: telnet smtp.gmail.com 587 You should get an answer like: 220 mx.google.com ESMTP fo3sm4401554wib.21 (and then you should just type `QUIT`). I am pretty sure you will get the same *Connection refused* after a while, or else things are really weird. :) It is possible that such a connection is blocked by a firewall or antivirus, which detects the SMTP protocol whatever host and port is used.
your code does not set the smtp host property, so it tries to send the mail via an smtp server on host "localhost" try to set this property: properties.put("mail.smtp.host", host); 
Good catch! In that case, don't forget to also set this property: properties.put("mail.smtp.port", port);
This was in the spam queue. I can't test this link as (sourceforge.net) is blocked where I am if this is spam report it.
How much effort do you expect *me* to put into helping you?
I don't expect you to do anything to help me personally. However, if you work on the project then I would expect you to want it to be easy for people to get up and running with the language.
**FOLLOW UP:** What it turned out to be was an issue with the Graphical Editing Framework plugins that I had installed when I reinstalled RAD 8.0. I uninstalled all of them, and have not had a problem since.
Not spam, just some pretty obvious tips.
Alright, I will try to do this without a physics engine. I'll take a look at JBox2D though, maybe i'll use it later.
Thanks to whoever unblocked it, I wondered where it went!
It looks like you have "print1n" (print-one-en) as opposed to "println" (print-ell-en).
it's println() not print1n() (That's a lower case "L", not the number "1"). The function name refers to printing a line (hence "ln"). Edit: Eclipse is very helpful when you're doing something wrong. See the red squiggly line under "print1n"? That's Eclipse telling you that it doesn't recognize the function. Hovering your mouse over the underlined function call will give you suggestions on how to fix it (can't remember, but Eclipse will probably suggest the corrected form of the function). Edit again: 9numbernine9 beat me by 12 seconds. Drat!
Yeah thanks,i found out just before you typed this.I dont see how thats a l though?
Thanks it was confusing but i have got it now and am really happy
println = print line there is no print1n also 1 != l :D
Don't see how that's an "l"? What do you mean? Most monospaced fonts print a "1" with a downward slope on the top, while they print an "l" with a completely horizontal line on the top.
It is not completely horizontal in my book it more looks like a 1
Are you trolling?
lmao I thought it was a 1 my first time seeing it too haha
Hence why I said "**Most** monospaced fonts". The difference between L's and 1's is something that was definitely confusing and aggravating for me when I first started. One thing to remember is that most programmers shy away from using numbers in function and variable definitions, unless they're absolutely necessary. When in doubt, try the "L".
Probably he is!
Things that stand out at first glance: private int Roll() { Looks like you followed the method-naming conventions elsewhere and just typo'ed this one: it should be "roll()", not "Roll()". public int[] getNumbersRolled() { It works fine for a simple-enough application, but, for anything serious, you'll want to get in the habit of using either collections (List, Set, Map) or making copies of your arrays. Arrays are inherently mutable, which means that I could call this method, change the array, and affect the internal state of the object. System.err.println("You done messed up, fool!"); Again, small project, so this is permissible, but, for anything serious, you'll want to either throw an exception or use a logging framework (I like slf4j and its various implementations) to raise these kinds of notifications. I'll note that I haven't actually inspected the logic of your code - gotta do some work eventually today. ;) 
ok thanks ill bear that in mind when i do bigger projects,I'm just still learning from the book
No im honestly not.Im only 13
Fair play to you!
&gt; you'll want to get in the habit of using either collections (List, Set, Map) or making copies of your arrays. Arrays are inherently mutable, which means that I could call this method, change the array, and affect the internal state of the object I'm not disagreeing with the idea of using collections, but your statement seems to imply that those collections you listed are inherently immutable, which is not the case. The tampering of the internals could still be accomplished through a getter if the class is returning a List such as an ArrayList. &gt; for anything serious, you'll want to either throw an exception or use a logging framework I disagree with this in regards to the example you are referring to from the endGame() method. This method is private to the class, so the class is in complete control of what data is passed to it, and therefore should never pass bad data to this method. If bad data is passed, it is just a coding error made by the class' author and will be caught when debugging. Perhaps an assertion would, in reality, be the better approach. Something else I would like to add: diceSum += (int) (6 * r.nextInt(5)) + 1; You want a random integer between 1 and 6, the method you are calling returns a double and then you perform some math and casting to get it to what you want. A more suitable solution would be to use Java's Random class diceSum += rand.nextInt(6) + 1; Where rand is an instance of the Random class. Additionally, the victoryStatus variable may be better as an Enum, with a different name, to represent the states of the game. 
I agree, the only thing that really stands out to me after my initial read through is the use of a single array as your data structure.
One thing that I noticed is that you're using ints as constants for the victoryStatus. I'd consider using enum constants for this instead. I also agree with the stuff that jrh3k5 pointed out. 
I had this same issue last week. When you started this project, you probably had JavaSE-1.7 selected rather than JavaSE-1.6. If you open your current project, you can confirm this for yourself. You can easily switch this back to JavaSE-1.6 by doing [this](http://i.imgur.com/Btw2p.png). Java released many updates that probably have no effect on you as a developer, so reverting back to a prior compatible version of Java will hopefully fix your problem as it did fix mine. Let me know if that fixes it c:
Your print statement is off :) Also, I'd highly recommend switching to something that doesn't have code completion and such. You don't want to be too reliant on it as you're learning.
&gt; ...imply that those collections you listed are inherently immutable, which is not the case. My apologies. I got a bit ahead of myself and neglected to mention the key factor - Collections' "unmodifiable*" methods.
yes fairplay to me hehe
I currently have JavaSE-1.6 selected. Re-selecting it did not change the output.
Hmm, then maybe your current system isn't up to date...but that wouldn't make sense because your .jar is running through eclipse properly. Play around with the compatibility options or update your java system (which I'm guessing you've done multiple times up to this point).
Okay, I messed around with the properties window a bit more. When I select my jre6 in my x86 Program Files folder, running the program in eclipse gives me the same error message as I was experiencing with the .jar file. It also lets me see the error that is coming up, which is an OutOfMemoryError. I'm going to try and change my java path to refer to the jre6 in my Program Files (not x86) and see if that gets it to work.
"String args[]" vs "String[] args" ? It's weird, I'm questioning myself here. It's like repeating a word till it sounds funny.
Okay. x86 java does not have enough memory to support a data set of the size that I was using, so I will reduce my data set size and see if it works.
This probably shouldn't matter, but how big does your .jar file turn out be? I never really exceed over 1mb for my .jar files, and I've never seen the OutOfMemoryError.
The jar file itself is only a few kb. The data set is generated on launch. I calculated that it should only be 16 MB in size, but 16MB shouldn't cause a problem, so I probably made a mistake somewhere. In any event, the program runs in x86 if I cut the data set in half, so I make this deadline. I'll deal with the memory issue later. Thanks so much for your help. Your first post put me on the track to figuring out what was wrong.
Without hesitating: `String[] args`
Java allows both, even on methods public class AllCorrect { public static void main(String args[]) { new AllCorrect().main2(args); } public void main2(String[] args) { System.out.println(test()[0]); } public String test()[] { return new String[] { "correct", "wrong" }; } } funny, eh?
Okay, when you said "Go to the website and show me where it explains what XText is", I thought you actually wanted me to help you personally. Thanks for clearing that up.
~~I haven't touch Enums ever for some reason. How exactly do Enums do what my integer system does?~~ Figured it out, I believe.
No, I was trying to illustrate how crap the XText website is.
In Eclipse, if you type System.out. Then press CTRL + SPACEBAR, you will get a list of your valid choices. Also, CTRL + 1 (that's the number 1) will give you suggestions for fixing errors (though it wouldn't help much here). I'd recommend [this](http://eclipsetutorial.sourceforge.net/totalbeginner.html) web tutorial after your book.
Thanks for saying that. Hope you get it figured out soon.
Ok thanks
public String test()[] ? is that the same as public String[] test() ? madness! 
yes.
use a java decompiler and decompile your .jar. you will see the main class isnt there. i had this problem and it was because my build files were somehow incorrect. i have a feeling it was because of java 1.6 / java 1.7 switching. how i got round it was create a new project and import all the .java files / packages, clean and build, then it worked
Not posting on http://www.reddit.com/r/javahelp ?
Didn't know there was that subreddit whoops
You are using too many comments. If the method is called startGame() and it is public then you don't need to document that fact it's for starting the game and it is public. This sort of pointless comment breaks up the code unnaturally and makes it harder to read. for (int i = 0; i &lt; 2; i++) { diceSum += (int) (6 * Math.random()) + 1; } This piece of code it's not obvious what's going on. Break this out and rename the variables. You use a magic number here ( the 2 ) only you know where it came from. Remove the comment and make the code more obvious. Don't leave any random numbers around the code that have to be explained with comments. Comments are much more inaccurate than reading code. private Random random = new Random(); private int roll(){ int sumOfDice = 0; int numberOfDiceToRoll = 2; for(int roll = 0 ; roll &lt; numberOfDiceToRoll ; roll++) sumOfDice += rollSingleDice(); } totalRolls++; numbersRolled[sumOfDice]++; return sumOfDice; } private int rollSingleDice(){ int numberOfSides = 6; return random.nextInt(numberOfSides); } Here I have renamed some of the variables and broke the dice roll out to a new method. I haven't got time to go through it all but apply this strategy to the rest of the code. You can break up your main method to atleast three more method calls. Okay and one final thing, you have this public getter method. public int[] getNumbersRolled() { return numbersRolled; } Here you are exposing the implementation of the class PlayCraps to the Craps class. Now if you want to change the datastructure from an Array to a List you will have to change all the classes which are dependent on it as well. This leads to tightly coupled code and it's a good idea to start thinking about how you can provide this data without exposing the internal structure. public int getRolledCount(int number) { return numbersRolled[number]; } Now this could be a list or an array without changing any of the external dependencies to it. p.s Also an enum is definitely the way to go for the VictoryStatus public enum VictoryStatus { WIN, LOSS, DRAW, UNKNOWN; } 
You said I could clone the array, so, something like this? public int[] getNumbersRolled() { return numbersRolled.clone(); }
Thanks, this is all appreciated. I need to work on being more sensical with how I set up my methods/classes/variables.
Just keep refactoring. Read through the code and each time leave a little bit cleaner. It should be a joy to read good code. Robert Martin would say that you should have methods that are a max of 5-6 lines long. If you want to learn more then you should check out his book, [clean code](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) I highly recommend it.
Great, will definitely look into that!
You can also do public static void main(String ... args) {} on java 1.6 and newer as well
what happens if you toss away all of the .class files, and then rebuild it using console commands (outside eclipse)? Any difference on the outcome?
println not print1n.
Probab1y he is!
Keep asking questions. What you are learning is the same stuff they teach in college courses. Keep exploring, and if you get stuck come back!
 that group barely has any members.
As a hiring manager, one thing I love to hear... I will do whatever it takes to learn what is XXx on my own time, and I can learn whatever you throw at me.
Maybe you should have. String args[] is syntactically correct. The auto-debugger indicator should have been your clue that it was the System.out method name that was the cause of the error. 
Just a reminder, in your manifest, the Main-Class parameter value does *not* have the .class extension. *Good:* Main-Class: your.package.MainClass *Bad:* Main-Class: your.package.MainClass.class
most of the stuff is said already. What I would like to add is my personal problem with single-line-control-statemenents w/o braces. Once the code is growing, that's a point of failure. So I always add them: if (vS == 0) { System.err.println("You done messed up, fool!"); } 
Agree, over-javadoc-ed to my taste. Rarely would I need to javadoc private methods, just name them better and keep them reasonably short
Be careful with if-else stacks. What happens if vs == 2? if (vS == 0) System.err.println("You done messed up, fool!"); else if (vS == 1) totalWins++; else if (vS == -1) totalLosses++; Aw, shoot, others have mentioned that it should be an enum. It is important to know why though. As is this method needs a final: else throw new IllegalArgumentException("Expecting 1, 0, or -1 received: " + vS) 
Did you choose the right run configuration in the export GUIs?
fairp1ay?
Keep going, fellow newbie here!
I know the other form is syntactically correct. In answer to *woodrail* who was hesitating between the two, I expressed my strong preference for the second. Also, I never said this was the cause of the error. That was obvious from the screenshot and already answered several times in the thread.
Use nested loops to cover an area and a fixed coordinate to make a line. Also, this doesn't strictly look like Java! And you seem to be missing a }.
i think you need a double array, something like int[][] array = new int[WIDTH][HEIGHT]; for(int x=0; x&lt;WIDTH; x++) { for(int y=0; y&lt;HEIGHT; y++) { System.out.println("x:" + x + " y: " + y); int valueInArray = array[x][y]; if(x == 0) { System.out.println("left wall"); } if(x == WIDTH-1) { System.out.println("right wall"); } if(y == 0) { System.out.println("ceiling"); } if(y == HEIGHT-1) { System.out.println("floor"); } } } 
Yeah, i'm missing an end bracket. Copy-pasted it from the code, so i probably missed a bracket. I don't know much about Java, but i know Unity has some funky Java-version. Gave me much pain when i was going to define a simple variable xD I'll have a look into nested loops, thanks :)
That's not Java, that's JavaScript, which is a completely different language, with only part of the name and a tiny bit of syntax in common with Java. You want [r/javascript](http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript). See also [http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/49325/java-or-javascript.html](http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/49325/java-or-javascript.html)
I don't get what's going on with the victoryStatus variable. You set it in establishPoint, then pass it as an argument into endGame, then reset it in endGame. It isn't read or written to anywhere else. The variable and the argument to endGame are redundant; eliminate one or the other. The "you done messed up fool" error message isn't very accurate. It incorrectly tells the user they've made a mistake when the problem clearly lies within the program. As others have pointed out, if you find yourself having to comment everything, you've probably done a poor job in making the code clear. My itch is the totalRolls getter which you've had to clarify in the comments. Rename the variable and getter to something more clear, like "sumOfAllRolls" and eliminate the comment. Similarly, numbersRolled isn't very descriptive. Perhaps, frequencyOfRoll, so you can say something like "frequencyOfRoll[ 7 ]". That probably should have a comment, though, explaining that the index is the roll, and clarifying that frequencyOfRoll[0] and frequencyOfRoll[2] will always be 0. 
Regarding the magic numbers, I would distinguish them from variables my making them constants at the top of the class: private static final int NUMBER_OF_DICE_TO_ROLL = 2; private static final int NUMBER_OF_SIDES_ON_DICE = 6; Also, I agree that you don't want to expose your internals, but that just means you should pick the return value based on what makes sense for the API, not your internal representation. An array or Collection make sense to me for the API. I'd be annoyed if I were writing a Stats-grapher or somesuch if a class made me poke it over and over in order to get all the values.
I haven't, sorry, its worth noting that scala also runs on play if you fancy really stretching yourself. I'm not sure I helped
I've tried it, just loaded and got the tutorial project up and running. One of my friends at work swears by it for small proof of concept projects. It also seems to have good plugin support to allow it to work with maven/gradle and also integrate into eclipse. I wonder how it will scale and if it will be useful for any large scale projects. The main thing with play seems to be the speed in which you can turn around a project.
I've played a little bit. - It automatically creates config files for different IDEs (I personally use IntelliJ IDEA). I liked it. - I didn't like its template engine syntax. It's too confusing. - Documentation is very good. - In general, I liked it. I'm planning to use it on my personal project but I want to wait until 2.0.
I do use Play and reeeeaaaally love it. It is the framework I use for all my personnal projects (I wish we use Play at work! Maybe one day...). It's very easy to configure/run/debug/test, but it still has the power of the JVM under the hood. Most of the time, you won't even have to think about the framework itself, you'll only have to concentrate on your app logic. I've also used a lot of PHP in my life, and I'd say the Play framework is indeed the perfect way to start using Java, if this langugage is new to you. For me, the only thing that is a little bit scary with Play, is that the Play commiters really like Scala and Play 2 will have a lot of its code rewritten in Scala. I guess this is a good news for the folks who enjoy Scala, but it's a little bit scary for those who want to stick to plain Java for now, like me. Java will still be supported in Play 2, but the way commiters talk about Scala, I'm afraid some features may be harder to use for Java users. Play 2 will also be very different from Play 1.2.X, so maybe you'll want to wait for the first release of Play 2 before starting to learn it? 
The PHP framework I use (Kohana) was the same - 3.0 was a total rewrite that wasn't compatible with the previous version (2.3). I might wait until Play 2.0 comes out and learn the new version instead.
Good idea, if Play 2 is just around the corner I'll wait until it comes out (even just a beta version) before learning about it. If it's, say, 12 months away I may as well learn Play 1.2 in the meantime. I'll have to look into it. Thanks! 
jar -tf myjar.jar lists the contents of the jar. it's not much more than a fancy renamed zip. no decompiler needed.
Haha, I see I have made a huge mistake. My apologies, and thanks for the help :)
play is excellent for java and scala.
No, I haven't. Yes, I too think that Ruby's monkey-patching is a no-no. And [Hindley-Milner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner) is pretty nice. ([Pierce](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/harmful-mfps.pdf)) Scala is great because you get all of Java, plus the kitchen sink too. Hm, Scala native Actors are quite powerful, but they're nowhere near [Akka actors](www.slideshare.net/remeniuk/first-glance-at-akka-20), as they're the Java / Scala equivalent of Erlang actors using green threads. Watch this too: http://days2010.scala-lang.org/node/138/159 [ http://sna-projects.com/norbert/ ] What do I think? Well, in my opinion software quality must increase in the coming years (because security concerns, and because we're plugging more and more devices into each other) and would like to scale (and it seems we have to do it by using concurrent processes running on multiple cores). So languages, frameworks, and libraries should help developers as much as possible, and Scala seems ahead in these regards compared to other languages. Though I look forward to a better JVM (true pauseless GC) better run-time optimalizations, and more efficient memory management.
Here's some interesting links about Play: http://zeroturnaround.com/articles/my-top-5-play-framework-features/ http://zeroturnaround.com/blog/play-framework-unfeatures-that-irk-my-inner-geek/
I'm using it. It's pretty good if you want an MVC framework.
I use it for a number of projects. Long story short, it's the best Java framework I've ever used. Hate J2EE but want to build Java-based websites? This is the framework for you. Also, AMA if you have specific questions.
I didn't *have* to comment everything. I just did because I thought I was supposed to. I updated my code though.
My thinking was that vs would never be set to 2. I have enums now though so it should be all set.
I used it to build [Rank.my](http://rank.my/) (still incomplete due to my day-job now occupying 150% of my time, if anyone would like to help me finish it pm me). Play places ease-of-use before doing this the normal "java" way. This makes it surprisingly easy to get up and running, but if you are an experienced Java programmer, some of the way that it works may seem "wrong" (such as it's heavy reliance on static methods, and the weird way it hooks into the compiler to determine the names of variables passed to the render method). I think coming from PHP you'll probably be quite comfortable with Play, it's probably about as low-friction as a Java web framework can get.
&gt; I didn't like its template engine syntax. It's too confusing. Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of its template engine, probably its main weakness.
I didn't do much research into it but I got the impression that javadocing everything was standard practice. Silly me. :)
Please don't give them any ideas. Eclipse is barely bearable as it is.
Really, most of the time if a method's purpose is unclear, renaming it and the parameters is the way to go. The problem with over-documentation is that it makes understanding the important stuff harder (have to hunt for it) and because documentation tends to stay static while code is re-factored, making it often wrong. On the other hand, interfaces, abstract methods, and other top-level framework/api classes probably require full documentation since they'll be shared.
Yeah, the problem is when your code grows someone will forget about the "magic rule". Enums are a good replacement for this example, but be suspicious of any switch or if-then tree that doesn't have a final safeguard to catch any bad values.
I don't like (or use) the default Groovy template engine either. I use [Japid](http://www.playframework.org/modules/japid), which is also way faster. 
Yes. Everything is better than PHP.
The first thing that struck me was that the argument "dS" in the checkRoll() method and "vS" in the endGame() method should be more descriptive. It's a little extra typing initially, but significantly more maintainable code in the long run. Other than that, your syntax and style are superb. Very readable code and well documented.
what do you use?
I use it in production (writing my app in Scala) and I quite enjoy it. The only thing that's annoying is that it's stuck with Scala 2.8.1 and needs some major rewrite (to be fixed for Play 2.0) to support Scala 2.9.x.
Tic Tac Toe is pretty simple for AI. Look up MiniMax. I can point you in the right direction if you're having problems. What do you have? Just my opinion, but this doesn't seem too remarkable for a science fair -- I've done Tic Tac Toe and Connect Four, but checkers, chess, or Go would be standouts instead. What age group? 
I'm one of the core devs of the project. I work at Zenexity, with Play's founder Guillaume. Feel free to ask any question. I've been using Play in all my projects for 2 years, and that's "real world" projects with a client and stuff. To respond to an other commenter: it is really important for us to provide a nice API in Java and a nice API in Scala. By nice api in Java I mean stuff similar to Play 1.0, simple and powerful. The last thing we want to do is to expose Scalaish concepts to Java developers. If you choose Java it's for a reason, and we respect that.
Sort of off the subject, but I bailed on Kohana when they rewrote it. As for the J2EE rapid development, I've done some stuff with Spring Roo. I might have to give Play some time though. Interesting stuff.
There's [a good discussion on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/125557/what-algorithm-for-a-tic-tac-toe-game-can-i-use-to-determine-the-best-move-for) about this problem. Tic-Tac-Toe is a relatively straightforward game and it should be relatively easy to write an algorithm that plays optimally, though it might not be any fun to play against. :-) Good luck!
11-13 I'm in 7th grade. Not very good at Java though.
Thanks, could you point me in the direction of any books for the over topic of AI, I need a 6 page research paper.
When do you expect that the Play 2.0 will be out of Beta and GA?
Scanner.nextLine() returns a String, and your constructor takes a double. Try using Double.parseDouble() or possibly another method in Scanner.
Thanks for your reply, but I'm not sure I understand where Double.parseDouble() would go. Sorry, I'm only a couple of weeks into the course.
 salary = salary++; That will assign salary to salary and then increment salary by 1. You can remove "salary =" from the statement and it's essentially the same. salary = salary + salary; This is the same as saying "salary = 2 * salary;" salary can only have a single value so it won't be the same as "salary1 = salary1 + salary2;" as I believe you are thinking it is in your mind. I know that doesn't answer your question, but it might help you if you know why those two options are incorrect.
You are overwriting salary with every iteration with the next value. Try salary += scan.nextInt();
Replace keyboard.nextLine() with keyboard.nextDouble() and change the type of r to a double. 
Thank you so much! Saved my life!
Thank you very much!
Look into game trees, and tree search. That will probably give you some ideas as to what games would be better to play against, and how to go about it.
checkers would be neat though, could you help me out?
The data will be stored also for reporting purposes. ex) MTD, YTD, ect.
Eclipse for my sins :(
Haters gonna hate. PHP really isn't that bad. Sure, you can write really bad code with it, but you can also write really elegant code with it. When optimised (ie. opcode cache like XCache or APC is installed), it's hard to beat the speed and overhead of PHP with a lightweight framework (like Kohana or CodeIgniter). A lot of other languages are either slower (like Ruby) or have more memory overhead (C#/.NET, Java).
Interesting articles, thanks :)
&gt; PHP really isn't that bad. The list of things worse is pretty short, but I'm open to suggestions.
try adding a caret listener to each that checks the current value of both fields and calls the JButton's setEnabled() method appropriately 
How long do you have? What do you know currently, and what do you have done if anything? The first parts would be to setup the GUI and the game logic (taking turns, when it's a win/lose/tie). Start with Tic Tac Toe to get a feel for how involved this will be. Checkers ups the intensity due to more rules (Kings, stalemates, multi-jumps, etc.).
You can help bring attention to this problem by [voting up](http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/addVote.do?bug_id=7077696) the [bug report](http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7077696) on the Oracle website.
Did you read the bug report ? it states the system configuration includes,"Windows Firewall on with no applicable exceptions" Also, It states that there is a workaround by adding an accept all connections rule to windows firewall, so it's a problem with the firewall rules. 
Let's be fair: most java is for servers, and oracle is notorious for only responding to "enterprise" concerns so this is probably not going to be a big deal to them. 
It looks like a DocumentListener makes sense (listens for changes to the text document for the text field). I'm not a huge fan of this, though, as it involves checking on every change to the textbox (every letter, etc.). There's also a KeyListener, but that seems not as good as (though a little easier to use than) DocumentListener. You could also just check the values when pressing the button (though I understand some situations where enabling the button when ready makes more sense).
I wrote the bug report. The failure happens without warning. Windows Firewall doesn't pop up a prompt like you might expect. It and/or Java simply terminates the control channel connection with no warning or explanation. To make it work you have to preemptively [add a firewall exception](http://www.enterprisedt.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=10700) by opening up a command-line and entering: netsh advfirewall set global StatefulFTP disable The fact that a workaround exists doesn't mean that there is no problem. It's not realistic to expect users of software to open up a shell and enter that command. Also, this is a problem that is new to Java 7. It hasn't existed in previous versions. I think it's happening because Java 7 has switched to using a newer Windows IP stack implementation - see [here](https://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=2250691).
Sorry, I deleted the comment codereign was replying to because I posted from the wrong account. The comment was: &gt; Actually a lot of corporations still use FTP. I know because they send in support questions all the time. They are gradually switching to FTPS and SFTP, but the wheels move slowly in large corporations. Anyway, yes I stand corrected. While a lot of corporations use FTP, few of them (probably) are running Java on Windows, which therefore also validates vermecin's comment.
textField.getDocument().addDocumentListener is the preferred way
Xtend is built using Xtext :P http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/xtend/
Xtend is just an implementation of Xtext that is Java-like. Nothing special about that. Xtext is where the magic is at -- it's a domain-specific language construction toolkit and environment that gives you lots of amazing functionality for free. With Xtext, you can make a language extension just like Xtend in mere hours. Your inputs are interpreted as serialised model instances, which can then be translated into any format or used to generate code. You get loads of IDE improvements, code completion, syntax highlighting etc for free. Anyone who has ever had to write an Eclipse plugin for a new language knows what pain is involved...
well the ftp code shouldn't be invoking windows to handle the firewall... If you want your java program to be windows firewall friendly you ought to do the necessary checks then invoke the windows firewall popup yourself..... the ftp code does as it should, it tries to make a connection, and if it cant it throws an exception which contains the error.
As far as I understand, it is supposed to be transparent for the application. Windows itself should show you this pop-up on the first attempt by the application to use this service.
Go to [gomocup!](http://gomocup.wz.cz/gomoku/)
I don't see the problem. Mostly Java is coded for servers for non-Windows environments. Windows Java is the minority so it makes sense why it's low priority. You'd first fix the bugs that majority uses.
If this hastens the move to FTPS &amp; SFTP, I'm all for it being low priority. Insecure FTP needs to die.
It should be somewhere in the beginning of 2012, but it will be usable in production before it's out of beta.
Agreed; At this point only ignorant assholes are using it....
Hi - I work on JDK7. I forwarded this internally, here's the response so far: *I don't think this is a JDK bug, it's just the Windows firewall recognizing and blocking ftp connections.* *I'd be curious to know if it happens if IPv6 is disabled (run with -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true).* Here's a somewhat related one: http://www.java.net/node/703177 
You should have some backing model, and when the user/pass values are present in the model, notify your view to enable the login button.
How is this related to Java ?
The changes are so simple that a lot of them could probably be converted the other way with a "disassembler" (Java-&gt;Xtend)
Because Java is evolving way too slowly. People would contribute to Java if it wasn't for the fact that it is [specified by a committee](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Lessons-Learned-from-Java-EE) (and not a well-functioning one).
and how exactly do you think windows firewall is going to magically know to allow your application before this happens?
[Answers to your questions](http://blog.redfin.com/devblog/2010/05/how_and_why_twitter_uses_scala.html)
 int n = Integer.parseInt(text.getText()); You might need a try-catch statement to handle bad input.
Thank-you, I am also having a similar trouble with making the 2nd text box's Text n. Text2.setText(n); Above does not work as n is an int and it only accepts Strings. Thanks again.
Text2.setText(Integer.toString(n));
Text2.setText(""+n); &lt;- this will convert anything on the right side of + to string or Text2.setText(new String(n));
I work for a company that's in the process of migrating off of Windows Server boxes. I can't say if this is a majority, but the use case exists, although it's dwindling.
&gt; Text2.setText(""+n); Two problems with this. 1. It sacrifices readability. It is much more explicit to say String.valueof(someint) or Integer.toString(someint) 2. It has a small runtime penalty of creating a new StringBuilder object behind the scenes to perform the concatenation. &gt; Text2.setText(new String(n)); You should avoid using the new String() constructor whenever possible, and in this case it is very easily avoided.
Java code is supposed to be system agnostic, so no checks for windows firewall permissions. Basic scenario should be: 1. Java application tries to access a network resource. 2. Firewall sees that and freezes the process while waiting for the user to answer whether he wants to allow it or not. 3. User allows the action execution of Java process continues. This is how it worked before, FWIW.
I completely forgot about String.valueof(). Thanks. And you are right about not using String constructor, but since this is a basic beginner question, I thought that it shouldn't hurt at this stage.
Thanks very much for all your help. I have another question. How do i get the .jar file of my project, I would like to show my friend (this is a calculator).
Or, how do I share my file so that it can be executed? Thanks so much.
What IDE are you using? They typically have a mechanism built in to export simple runnable jars. ex. If you are using Eclipse: Right click the project Export Java &gt; Runnable JAR file Tell it the file with the main method and where to export to, then select finish and you'll have a runnable jar. Edit: formatting
I am using netbeans IDE apparently i am supposed to build the file, locate the file name then zip up the dist folder containing the jar file and libraries.I have tried this but It doesn't seem to work, and besides thats a bit complicated for sharing a calculator don't you think?
This doesn't look to be the proper way to work in group...
Why doesn't it happen with JDK 6?
http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html Since, the article doesn't seem to actually link it.
Really? More popular than English or Chinese? Hmmm.... am I missing the point? :D But seriously, does anyone using Java professionally have any real insecurity that Java isn't going to be in the top 5 for the foreseeable future? There's a lot of wannabe solutions out there, but the real contenders are few and far in between.
No one will ever notice. You just have to make them accept the changes Java-&gt;Xtend-&gt;Java causes. That first step might change a lot of syntax to the way the Java-&gt;Xtend converter works.
From the related link that JeffAtSun posted: *JDK 7 brings support for IPv6 on Windows. When you attempt to connect to an IPv4 address then under the covers it will use an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address* So my guess is that Windows firewall is blocking IPv6 (JDK7) and not IPv4 (JDK6).
Meh, that's a weak relation IMHO.
Hhhaaaaaahahhaahahahgah. That's all. really though, a statement based on what? Replace Jave in what area (JEE/JSE)? What will replace all current frameworks (Spring, Struts,JSF,Hibernate, JPA, etc.)? Have they looked at Apache Java projects? Just look at apache commons, how will Scala replace that? And most importantly, how will Scala replace the millions on Man-hours put so far in java systems around the world ? If they can answer the above points we might then have a discussion, for now tell these programmers to go work and listen to what the architects are telling them.
I agree but, I'm not going to say that Scala can't overtake Java. I see you were downvoted, why downvote and not give reasoning for it? 
It's not a race though, different technology tools can be used to solve different technical and business problems. Java, Scala, Quick Basic all should have their place in any developer/programmer arsenal, a hammer is not better than a screw driver :) And I think I was down voted for my evil, asshole-like laugh I started my comment with 
I think you're a bit confused - Scala can make use of any library currently written for Java. Spring, Hibernate, Apache Commons, whatever - it's all JVM bytecode in the end. Scala also doesn't have to replace the millions of man hours implemented in Java - it can just build on top of it. The entire point of Scala is seamless Java integration, but with a different programming paradigm. Scala and Java each have their own strengths, and each fills a role - I don't believe one will replace the other at all. For example, Java significantly outperforms Scala in an single thread, but Scala scales much more easily. It all depends on your application. Perhaps you should save your arrogant, inflammatory comments for when you actually know what you're talking about. 
Hey, Ruby called it wants its trollbait back. Seriously though, many languages have come and gone in Java's lifetime, nothing has come close to its penetration as a language. It's not to say nothing will but it is a hard act to follow in 5 years. I remember when I started coding Java, c and C++ were the dominant languages and Java slowly gained traction. It had to be significantly better to do that, GC and platform portability were the killer feature that allowed it to become dominant, it was also easy to understand if you came from a c background. I don't think any language has had anything like the kill feature(s) that GC and WORA represented for Java over c and C++. I think Scala is awesome, I think it is better than Java as a language for the top 5-10% of developers, I think it has amazing features, I think it blends OO and Functional brilliantly. However will this dislodge Java in 5 years? I'm not convinced, it has a steep learning curve even for gifted programmers from Java (or other c like languages) and doesn't offer _significantly_ more benefits. I do believe something will come along and be the dominant language and I do think Scala will be big, but big like Ruby or Python not big like COBOL, c, c++ or Java.
You might want to try Netbeans, I found Netbeans to be more user friendly than Eclipse when starting out. Also, if you're in netbeans you can type "sout" then hit tab and it will fill in System.out.println(); Likely there is something like that in Eclipse.
Wooo inflammatory, relax man! There is a growing list programming language That run inside the JVM and lives happily with Java (groovy, jython, jruby, and ofcourse Scala) The topic is about replace, not integrate, if we are talking integration then yes, very valid response on your part and very ignorant on mine, we are talking about replacing java :) 
I'm fine now.I'm using eclipse because the guy who wrote the book im reading used eclipse
The phrase "replace Java" means "no new code written in Java" not "reimplement everything ever written in Java". Assuming the latter is ridiculous. You're just whining about semantics, and your arguments do not reflect reality. Your post was ignorant, arrogant, and blatant flamebait, and I honestly don't even know why I'm bothering.
FTP is no less secure than HTTP with [basic access authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). Sometimes you don't care if your connection is secure. FTP is very fast and allows uploads of very large files (i.e. multi-GB), which HTTP doesn't.
Some points: 1. Non-Java FTP clients don't have this problem. That is, Windows Firewall doesn't complain when a transfer is initiated. 2. Even if we accept that the firewall should react then surely it should pop up a prompt for the user rather than simply silently killing the connection. 3. As it stands, to use FTP on JDK7 the user has to open up an administrator shell and execute a netsh command. This is impractical and, again, not necessary on pre-JDK7 and non-Java clients. Something is wrong with the way you're interfacing with the IP stack. You need to fix it or the grand-daddy of all Internet protocols won't work on your platform anymore.
I've passed these comments along to the engineer assigned to the bug, I'll try post a reply tomorrow.
&gt; But seriously, does anyone using Java professionally have any real insecurity that Java isn't going to be in the top 5 for the foreseeable future? There's a lot of wannabe solutions out there, but the real contenders are few and far in between. I think the longer-term future of Java hinges on Java 8 and features like closures. This will determine whether it becomes primary a legacy language, or a language that continues to foster new and innovative stuff.
I think that is actually pretty accurate. The language is straight-forward, easier to learn than Java (and many other languages out there), has tons of libraries available, has the best IDE support out there compared to other 'Java alternatives', the build tools are magnitudes better and faster, the REPL is just great and the most importantly: **The Scala team constantly delivers** which sets them apart from pretty much every “Java/Scala wanna be language”. They said: - “We will make compilation faster” and they delivered - “We will speed up REPL startup” and they delivered - “We will improve IDE” and they deliver - “We will slim down the Scala distribution” and they delivered - “We will provide a better collection API” and they delivered - “We will write more documentation” and they deliver This is the stuff I care about. Java-the-language is out-dated and no amount of effort can get it moving again.
Spot on, but: &gt; Java significantly outperforms Scala in an single thread When doing the same thing, both languages pretty much emit the same byte code. Every measurement I've seen shows that Scala and Java are in the same area, performance-wise. Sometimes Scala is faster, sometimes Java.
Thanks. I'm really glad you're here to speak for Oracle. I thought I'd also add that the two FTP clients that ship with Windows, i.e. ftp.exe and Windows Explorer, don't require any firewall configuration prior to using them. By the way, in hindsight my use of the word 'you' seems silly. Hopefully you understand that I mean 'your company'.
It's hard enough to find qualified java developers. Any project manager switches to Scala at their own peril. I don't see it happening soon with the current landscape as there isn't enough Scala developers to justify the switch.
Some anecdotes show that it makes hiring easier, because it filters out 99% of those “I learned `public static void main` in university, but have no actual clue...”-experts and improves the attractiveness of the job offer to people who actually care about code quality.
I've been developing in Java for about 10 years and almost all of the projects I have been on fall under the category of "mainframe migration". With that said, all of those mainframe migrations required a fair amount of Cobol mainframe development to either help the migration or build new functionality for new requirements while the migration was ongoing. Some of that mainframe code I am replacing was written in 1976! (Railroad industry) To say that Java will be replaced in 5 years by Scala is quite a statement seeing that many large companies are migrating from Cobol to Java right now and have ~5 year roadmaps dedicated to the language. I think Java has at least a 10-15 year horizon before it really starts to wither and there will still be plenty of Java work at that time to support migrations. 
your question is a bit obtuse... what exactly are you stuck on?
it would seem you wish to get the selections from 2 combo boxes when some action is performed e.g. button click and do something with those 2 values? I am not going to go check but the method is something like combo.getSelectedItem() and to do something when a button is clicked you need to look at implementing an ActionListener.
I left my code at work, but I'll do my best with this... I have my arrays which are something like interestArray[] = {5.5, 5.25, 5.35}; yearsArray[] = {7, 15, 30}; and I want to plug these into a combo box that has the options of 7 years at 5.5, 15 years at 5.25, and 30 years at 5.35. I built a simple GUI using NetBeans and it created the string for these options already. So I need to bridge the gap from having a worthless combobox into a functioning operation that plugs these values into my calculation that is already in my code. I'm sorry, I'm sure this isn't clear enough. 
What will Scala replace Java with?
Are these anecdotes all made up by Scala developers with superiority complexes?
With the amount of Java enterprise software out there (identity management, middlewear, CRM, BI, workflow etc) and the time it has taken to develop it I seriously doubt this claim.
Speaks a man who actually works in the real world. 
No, the actual anecdote is about OCaml, but nice try. :-)
&gt; But then they use Java's VM. And your point is? I don't care in which language an application server or a library is written in as long as I don't have to write Java myself. &gt; ... didn't have the JVM or libaries Unlike Java, Scala is meant to be platform-independent. So there is also a backend for .NET, JavaScript and LLVM. &gt; We built your foundation Ah right. The creator of Scala wrote the `javac` pretty much every Java developer is using since 1.3. Show some respect. What did you contribute to Java? Links please. C'mon, man up and stop being so envious. :-) 
You still haven't understood the difference between using language independent bytecode and using a programming language.
Is there anything preventing developers to use those parts from Scala?
That's actually the impression I got from you. Did you provide any facts anywhere? Some hints: FourSquare, LinkedIn, Twitter, ...
Looks like my job is safe for a little while longer :)
Brainfuck.
Probably not, but that is not the topic. Scala may progress in replacing Java as a language of choice for point solutions but for the enterprise it will take longer than 5 years
Before getting rid of Java, maybe we should get rid of the still very much alive Fortran and COBOL first.
Aieeeee! You said "complex"! I'm melting!
Given that it has yet to break into the top 50 languages in the 8+ years it has been out I'm doubtful. [TIOBE chart from Sept 2011](http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html)

A lot of that just sounds like marketing material since it is relative to only itself or other languages with very low adoption. Java was only referenced twice and one of those is highly dubious (ex. Scala is easier to learn than Java). Most developers just want to use what will get them a job. The status quo really only changes when there is a compelling reason to change. Comparing a language to the previous version of itself isn't much of a story.
WTF? Did I miss a meme, or are you just fucking weird?
/trade WTB Sense of Humor...
Perhaps both. A common criticism of Scala is that it is "too complex".
Closures aren't a fad, nor are the the "hip new thing", they've been around for at least 36 years, making them a few years older than I am (and I'm definitely not a "hip new thing").
You're either trolling or you are a monumental fucking moron. In either case, I'll waste no further time on you.
Java is good, also Dart. What? Oh come on now. We shouldn't take these serious, people.
Ah, I see. :)
itself. smartass.
Within 5 years Java 9 will replace Scala :)
Whoosh.jpg
Maybe Java will be replaced, but maybe not by Scala: Ceylon and Kotik also look promising with much cleaner syntaxes than Scala but with some of the same features.
&gt; but with some of the same features Scala certainly lacks a few features of Ceylon and Kotlin, like: - No compiler - No libraries - No documentation - No specification - No IDE support But I guess this will help them overtake Scala :-)
I think that Scala is superior to Java in any meaningful comparison is already very well established and doesn't need any discussion anymore.
Its a pretty even mix. Some positions require a clearance but there are lots of govt contractors / agencies / private corps that don't. I worked in the area for 4 or 5 years and never got a clearance. 
Do you like the market? I in Atlanta now. I hear it is kind of similar.
Look at your Netbeans generated build.xml, it will list some hooks, You can add a "-post-jar" target that will automatically get called as part of the normal build process everytime netbeans builds the jar. Inside that use a zip task to zip all the files you want into a zip file. [Ant zip task](http://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/zip.html)
Markets are all pretty much the same, DC's leans more towards govt contracting. You can make amazing money there, though some positions are better then others. I've turned down very high hourly rate positions with some govt agencies because the work environment seemed like it would be soul crushing, and opted to work on the private side instead. You will without a doubt have no problem finding a java position, there are tons up there. Talk to some recruiters in the area to get a feel for what is out there. I've contracted for Apex and Teksystems (would recommend the later). DC is a fun city to live in. 
You should be using SwingWorker if you want updates. Pass the worker into the long-running method you're calling (or reference it some other way), and call firePropertyChange("anyString", oldValue, newValue) on the worker when something update-worthy happens. If the old value doesn't matter, just pass in null for that argument. You can put any string you want in the firePropertyChange method and handle it in the callback in your UI code - this lets you update multiple things with one worker. For example, one part could fire back the text "progress" with an integer value and update the general progress bar, and another could fire back "log" with a string value and append to a TextField. 
Alternately, spawn a thread to do the processing and pass it a reference to the progress bar. At meaningful times update the progress bar (and other elements of interest): SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable{ progressBar.setValue(progress); });
It's easier to use SwingWorker; it takes care of the mechanics of publishing status updates for you.
Ahh. That's fair.
What I meant though is that you should check the autocomplete functions for eclipse so that you never have to type stuff like that again.
I thought there was a Scala IDE: http://www.scala-ide.org/
C/C++ is still generally listed as the second most common languages used. When I tell people this and they don't beleive me I can tell they are business/enterprise/web devs.
Read again ... note the double negation. :-) Scala has all things mentioned in the list, that was pure irony.
Thanks, that did the trick nicely! 
When I tried this before, the GUI did not actually update until everything was done. I think I am missing a fundamental aspect, so I am going back and looking at the whole framework from the top down. I wonder if the thing I needed was just to write a property change listener in this case, too. On a side note, this is getting me thinking about a bunch of agent based (possibly distributed) simulation thoughts. I have never worked with threads before, but I can draw a lot of parallels between the EDT being a world/ground truth thread and other threads being agents acting on it. Good stuff
by what metric? jobs , lines of code? I could see C being up there with javascript in lines of code. But no way C++ is even close to a contender for 2nd place
any project where project managers are deciding language and architecture is already doomed anyways.
you're not not doing it wrong
Looks like we're going to have to talk with the MS folks - we don't think we can control the firewall or force Windows to pop a dialog. More: &gt; It looks like a Windows firewall bug. The firewall has a filter that examines client sockets to FTP servers in order to keep track of incoming data connections from the server. In the case of connecting to IPv4 destinations through IPv6 sockets, it seems to get confused and rejects the PASV command. &gt; &gt;There are a couple workarounds: &gt; &gt; 1) as suggested in the CR, to add a firewall exception for jdk7 &gt; 2) run java with IPv6 disabled (-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack) Thanks for bringing this to our attention. :)
The argument of private over public is rooted in the "only as needed" mentality - if an external someone doesn't need access to a method in a class, then make it private. It's always easier to take a private method and make it public than it is to take a public method and make it private. Public getters allow you finer control of access to information; for example, say I have the following class: class Person { public Date birthDateTime = new Date() } If I wanted only read-only access to the birth date and time, then I can't get it with direct access - someone could do: new Person().birthDateTime.setTime(123); ...and be able to modify the internals of the object. Conversely, if I did the following: class Person { private Date birthDateTime = new Date() public Date getBirthDateTime() { return new Date(birthDateTime.getTime()); } } ...now someone could try to modify the returned Date object all they want, but the internals of the Person object remain unchanged. 
It really depends on what your class is being used for. If it's a private class that you're just using internally to store some data, then having a public field might be easier than using getters and setters. However, you lose a lot of control by doing that. For example if you want to have an immutable class (which is generally considered to be a good thing for concurrency and whatnot), you can't have exposed public fields like that, since some code elsewhere can easily change the variable. Similarly maybe you want to have some constraints, (maybe it doesn't make sense for num to be negative for example). With a public variable, some code elsewhere can just set num to be anything, without any constraint checking. If you instead used a setter, the setter can verify that the value makes sense. Similarly maybe other code needs to know when the value of num has changed, with a setter you can see if the new value is different, and broadcast an appropriate event. The nice thing is, maybe at first you don't care about any of those things, so you just write a plain old setter. If you later on want to add some kind of constraint checking, or change notification you can just modify the setter, and all of the calling code will still work. However if you started with a public variable, and later decide to change to a setter, you'll have to modify all of the code to use the setter instead.
Isn't that sarcasm, not irony? And you didn't read the bit in OC that said "look promising".
I usually reference the tiobe ranking http://www.tiobe.com/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html Not ideal but what measure is... currently the order is 1. Java 2. C 3. C++ and a coming up quick C#... I assume all the C++ microsoft weenies are switching to C#.
jrh3k5 gave a good overview about public vs private. APIs should be designed on a need-to-know basis. The Java getter/setter method style is used to abstract the data the class wants to expose from how it is actually stored. It also helps keep a consistent style throughout your code, which improves readability and maintainability. Most of the time you'll just have a String or an Integer that you just return or set from those methods, but other times you need some logic performed to get the value you want. For instance, if you have a list of Customer objects stored internally in a class, you can overload a getter method to get a specific Customer based on some criteria. This allows you to encapsulate the logic near the data, instead of just returning the whole list and parsing it in the calling code. getCustomer(String name) getCustomer(int customerId) etc. 
Using ant? http://code.google.com/p/jarjar/ Using maven? http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/descriptor-refs.html#jar-with-dependencies Both should give you a single executable jar file that includes all needed libs. And .. NO .. zipping a dir isn't complicated. 
Additionally, it just occurred to me: try and globally synchronize access to a public field.
&gt; Isn't that sarcasm, not irony? Right.
Let's say you have a class that is a `Person` a person has an `age`. Now you write a few thousand lines and reference person.age a few times. What's wrong with this? Maybe nothing, but maybe for whatever reason, you decide later you need to store a birthday and so you'll eliminate the .age variable and give a function called `getAge()`to recalculate it, well you now have to rewrite the entire program or risk the objects having ages that don't match their birthdays. What would be a simple 2-3 line change to getAge() is instead a complicated fix. Now, let's say a structure internally has a pointer to "next" and if you change it, the structure falls apart. Making it `private` will make it so someone using only have methods that leave the structure in a good state. They don't have to give a crap about the next pointer, because the "add()" method and "remove()" method handle that and they CAN'T break it by messing with it. Any time you think "well if they set this to -1, the whole thing would crash" it needs a get/set that prevent it from being set to -1. If you have an item like a Person.status letting a function set it is much better if it's Person.setDivorced(), Person.setSeparated(), Person.getStatus, then you can easily change the implementation to integers or strings or whatever underneath.
So it sounds like either MS's own FTP clients are not using the IPv6 stack, or they're using undocumented features to get it to work. Do you have any idea how soon we might expect a fix for this problem? Days, weeks, months? Also, is it still being treated as a low priority problem as is indicated in the [bug report](http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=7077696)? Thanks again for your efforts.
I don't think Java is going anywhere soon. Despite working in Java for my last two professional jobs, I do think it is good practice to keep up-to-date with trending technologies (I would suggest Ruby, one of the major Javascript framework libraries, and some basic scripting knowledge such as in Python). You don't want to automatically be closed off to opportunities due to an HR-resume filter.
&gt;If it's a private class that you're just using internally to store some data Of course if you use inner classes you can retain quite a bit of control and member protection.
It's easier to refactor.
The answers to all your questions are in Sun's Java Tutorials. Here's a direct link relating to JTextFields &amp; Actions - [How to Use Text Fields](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/textfield.html). Pay special attention to the API section. Good luck!
So, from the code I can see, your switch will always go to the case 5 part. The part "switch (switchExpression)" means "when switchExpression equals this...". A switch statement is very much like a big if-else statement, with only numbers in java for now. So, your switch needs to check the user input, not the fixed number 5. And to output to a label, you can replace (or in addition to) the system.out lines with a call to set the label's text value.
Your switch expression is printing to standard out. It should be setting a value to a String, which you could use in your .setText() method. Your .setText() method currently, is only ever going to be 5.
can you possibly elaborate on the setText part?
So i fixed the first part, but now i dont' know what to put for the windspeeds.setText part. i just need to have it display what the person has picked (by selecting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or default) in the switch.
You say you want the label to display the strings that you're printing to the standard output, yes? Inside each case should be "Windspeeds.setText("windspeed data");". The last line of your code is redundant, and sets the text in your Windspeeds jLabel to the value of switchExpression.
I think the int primitive type can only be accessed atomically, so there's that...
It's basically part of the theory behind API design: It's terrible to change existing functionality, so you want to expose as little as possible (while still having your code do something useful) so that if something in your code needs to change, you reduce the chance that the change will affect the API. You'll almost surely learn to internalize this lesson with experience, so you can think of it as dogma that you'll just adhere to, even if you're skeptical the whole time doing it, until you either learn to agree with it, or have the self confidence to break it.
Yeah, it's a bit complicated, but programming is full of complicated tasks, and this is far from the most complicated problem you'll ever encounter in programming.
It might not that the project manager is choosing the language, but rather that the project manager is given a legacy project, already written in language X, and the client wants new a hundred new features implemented by Monday. Sure, an elite programmer can learn a new language in a week, but we don't have a week to spare. So the candidates being considered for hire are programmers who already know X.
I've programmed in Java for professionally for about 6 years (and a couple of years before that as a hobby), and then switched to a job where I mainly program in Scala. I don't think Scala is going to replace Java in 5 years, because they are targeting a different demographic.
Depends on the problem you're trying to solve, but for extremely simple one-off tools (e.g. you want to implement a page that shows a user his/her IP address), I'd rather write it in PHP than with servlets.
It's a very nice Java framework to work with, but I don't like how it does "magic" stuff by via bytecode manipulation (I think via a custom classloader?). I'd rather everything be "normal" Java, even if it means making the abstraction a bit leakier. I want to leverage my existing Java knowledge, rather than learn the "play"-variant of Java.
If that were the case, why would there be an AtomicInteger class?
This looks to me like it would output 1:2, I personally don't see why it would be 1:4, also the f() does nothing and making an array with a length of one seems odd too, I'm no pro though. Edit: actually my bad, f() takes that array a[] and changes the value of it to 4, even though it's under a new name for the method.
I thought only arrays used .length? Everything else uses a .size() method. I guess Strings are an exception that use length()...but that's about it, and they're really pretty much an array. Anything that's in the Collection class is size().
This is just bad api design from java. But the inconsistency is fairly limited. size() is a method and can be found on the entire Collections API. List, Map, Set and so forth. length is a property and is limited to java arrays, which are sort of a language feature. You don't initialize it as a new Array, rather you say something like Integer[] a = new Integer[] {1,2,3}; There is little reason to be using arrays, in all honesty.
New project probably just refers to the notion of an eclipse project. I.e. the location of the .project file. I would recommend maven as a standard project structure to use instead of the old src/lib layout that eclipse generates (if i remember correctly). http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html
The simple answer is that ints are passed by value and arrays are passed by reference. A more complex answer is that the memory location of an int holds the int itself, whereas the memory location of an object holds a reference to it. When the memory locations are copied for the method call, the int's value is copied but the object's reference is copied, so the method still points to the same object.
yep, arrays are reference types, so the call to f gets the reference to the array passed in, so it changes the value in the array.
A project generates a bunch of supporting files, most importantly an ant build script. Without that, you would have to individually compile your source which is a pain in the ass. There are many other reasons, but that is the most functional. 
As a buisiness/enterprise/web dev, I am mildly insulted...but I deserve it for the company I keep. In all seriousness you are right. I am doing my compsci degree now after 10 years of IT, and I didn't realize the breadth of programming that is going on in the world. When you are in the container of programming for profit, it is hard for some to believe that there is anything else out there. Someone has to make sure that pretty little webapp display on 5 different types of screens though.
This got me to understand the most, can you elaborate a little more on reference? What do you mean? I get what you are saying when you say ints pass values, but im still having some difficulty understanding reference.
&gt; I have all my classes in the same folder, Please, for you own sanity, don't do this. It works fine when you are just starting out and have just a few tens of classes. In 10 years when you have hundreds, if not thousands, of classes you will have problems.
Rather than passing a copy of the array, a reference is passed, so when the function modifies the array, the caller sees that same modification. The reason why arrays behave differently is that they are "Objects". The above properly holds for all objects (i.e. anything that's not int, long, short, char, boolean, double, float)
The memory where variables are stored is divided up into segments of say 64 bits. For objects, this contains reference information such as what type and where on the heap the actual object is located. For an int, the value can actually fit in this space so no reference is needed. Say you have the following memory locations: x: 1024: i526 //the value 526 y: 1088: o15576 //an object at memory location 15576 ... 15576-16000 ... //object's fields so when you pass x and y to a method, the values (i526, o15576) are copied. The int is now in two places without sharing anything, so changes in one place will not affect the other. However, the value for the object is referencing another memory location where all of its data is stored. Even tho that is copied too, both copies point to the same data, so modifying one effects both.
I think you are looking for: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_package
We use Eclipse BIRT. It is very powerful, pretty good at dynamic layouts and the Designer is very good. We are now integrating the runtime into our application, but we used the example WebViewer for viewing reports for a while. It's very easy to integrate the runtime, and there are some good examples explaining the whole thing. Are you building the reports programatically or are you just runnning pre-designed reports?
I ended up ditching jasper and going with a HTML -&gt; PDF solution. There are a number out there but I use FlyingSaucer, it is a open source HTML renderer that can output to PDF and supports CSS3. You have all the printing CSS attributes and what not. I generate the HTML using velocity. By far the simplest solution I have found. I believe that Google does something similar with the reports generated in analytics
Another more correct way to put it is that ints are passed by value, and array object references are also passed by value. What's tripping here is that people forget that variables hold references to objects, not the objects themselves. So primitives are passed in exactly the same way as object references, by value. 
When I compile my main file it compiles them all, or do you mean something different
Make I suggest that you have a look at a book called Head First Java (2nd Edition). 
I currently have that on order.. good book yes?
no.
I'll second BIRT. It works best again SQL data sources and has an excellent range of output formats.
Think of it as follows. A class with all its members public, without access control, is like building a house with no doors and leaving all your valuable possessions in plain view. They *might* still be there by the time you get back, but it's not guaranteed. You need to assume all responsibility for making sure nobody nicks anything. A class with private member variables and one or two public methods is a concrete bunker with bars on the windows and only a few ways in and out. It's still possible to use the class in ways it wasn't intended, but it is much, much easier to guarantee that the behaviour of the internal state of the class remains consistent. Good application design always favours having as little exposed as possible. It means you have less interdependency between modules of code, and it makes maintenance, testing and debugging much easier. 
in my opinion, this is the best free resource for beginners. http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ read the trails covering the basics. it explains a lot of stuff in a very simple and plain way.
Thanks for the recommendation... I'll look into it
Then do we need to do more to include Velocity templates? Since I want the reports to a Java SE App
It would help if you could be more specific about the product and the types of the product. I think it's unlikely that you should have different subclasses for different types of products. [Prefer composition over inheritance.](http://www.google.com/search?q=Prefer+composition+over+inheritance)
Say you had different types of box, and there were multiple options for properties for a box, each configurations gives you a different type of box the company produces..
What you are observing is the function of a project. If you just threw a bunch of source files into a folder and opened them in the IDE, they would not compile all when you compiled your main. You would have to recompile individually. Not a big deal when you are doing a 3 source file program, but when you have a multi-file, multi-package program that you want to test-&gt;build-&gt;package-&gt;deploy many times a week or even day bundling everything together into one entity and automating that process is crucial. 
Yes, you could have something like class Box { private Set&lt;BoxProperty&gt; properties; ... } or class Box { private FooBoxProperty foo; private BarBoxProperty bar; ... } or class Box { private BoxConfiguration configuration; ... } But you need to be way more specific about the options for properties and their differences (what defines a box?) and expected methods (what does a box *do* that a different box doesn't do, and what do you need to be able to do with all of them?) for me to be able to come up with a realistic design.
It is because fields cannot be changed to methods later and Java lacking a real property functionality.
Reads &amp; writes are atomic for primitives. But you tend to do a lot of: num++ which is a read THEN a write, so the read is atomic, the write is atomic but the two together are not. AtomicInteger makes it possible to do the read/write operation together atomically.
I have two monitors and it increases my productivity for nearly everything. It's great to write code while looking at an example or some Javadoc in the other monitor. You don't have to constantly lose focus from your work by switching back to a browser window etc. It's also nice for students writing papers so you can have your paper open in one monitor and your source in another. TL;DR I highly recommend at least 2 monitors to increase productivity :D
I've been using 2 monitors for about 6 years now, and cannot go back to one without cutting my productivity by anywhere from 30 to 70 percent. For web development, I've really got no idea how you'd do it otherwise.
And, this sort of thing, ladies and gentlemen, is why software needs to be taught in an apprenticeship-style program, and not in as homework assignments. If I get a few minutes later, I'll sketch something out. 
Two is a huge improvement, but I've always found 3 to be the sweetspot.
Thank you. Sorry If whatever I coded is unbelievably inaccurate. If you could see the notes we are given in class you'd understand why someone with absolutely no experience with programming is struggling so much. :(
You could override the toString() method of the Word class and have that method return the internal string representing the word. Then, you just call word.toString().length(). 
When you do: ArrayList&lt;Word&gt; You are creating an arraylist of type "Word". For example, you could create an arraylist of type "String" by doing: ArrayList&lt;String&gt; So this: String w = words.get(x); is wrong because words.get(x) is going to return a Word, not a String. I don't know what the Word class looks like, but there is probably a method to return a string, so something like this: String w = words.get(x).getString(); Also could be written like this: Word word = words.get(x); String w = word.getString(); Without knowing what the word class looks like, I can't help you any further. Hope all that made sense.
What do you mean by "it doesn't seem to work" ? Is the dist folder not there? You need to hit "Clean and Build" in the menu to create the dist folder with the libraries and jar file.
Two is very nice - I have 2 20'' (non-widescreen) and I'm using all the screen real estate. I run Eclipse in fullscreen in one window, and the browser in the other. In the background I have consoles, SQL editors and other programs that I can switch to. 
or add the length() method to word as you don't seem to actually need the string. What methods are already available on Word?
Here's a quick and dirty stab.... not my best code, but it's reasonably readable. import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.HashMap; public class Budget { private static final Integer MONTHS_IN_YEAR = 12; private static final Integer JANUARY = 0; private static final Integer FEBRUARY = 1; private static final Integer MARCH = 2; private static final Integer APRIL = 3; private static final Integer MAY = 4; private static final Integer JUNE = 5; private static final Integer JULY = 6; private static final Integer AUGUST = 7; private static final Integer SEPTEMBER = 8; private static final Integer OCTOBER = 9; private static final Integer NOVEMBER = 10; private static final Integer DECEMBER = 11; private class MonthlyBudgetItem { // Default to Zero private Double amount = 0.0; public MonthlyBudgetItem(Double amount) { this.amount=amount; } public Double getAmount() { return amount; } public void setAmount(Double amount) { this.amount = amount; } } private class YearlyBudgetForCategory { private ArrayList&lt;MonthlyBudgetItem&gt; monthlyBudgets = new ArrayList&lt;MonthlyBudgetItem&gt;(MONTHS_IN_YEAR); public ArrayList&lt;MonthlyBudgetItem&gt; getMonthlyBudgets() { return monthlyBudgets; } private String categoryName; public YearlyBudgetForCategory(String categoryName) { this.categoryName = categoryName; for (int i = 0; i &lt; 12; i++) { monthlyBudgets.add(new MonthlyBudgetItem(0.0)); } } public void addBudgetItemToMonth(Integer month, Double amount) { MonthlyBudgetItem budgetForThisMonth = monthlyBudgets.get(month); Double currentMonthlyBudget = budgetForThisMonth.getAmount(); Double newMonthlyBudget = currentMonthlyBudget + amount; budgetForThisMonth.setAmount(newMonthlyBudget); } } HashMap&lt;String, YearlyBudgetForCategory&gt; budgetItems = new HashMap&lt;String, YearlyBudgetForCategory&gt;(); public Budget() { // do nothing } public void addBudgetItem(String category, Integer month, Double amount) { YearlyBudgetForCategory yearlyBudgetForCategory = budgetItems.get(category); if (yearlyBudgetForCategory == null) { yearlyBudgetForCategory = new YearlyBudgetForCategory(category); budgetItems.put(category, yearlyBudgetForCategory); } yearlyBudgetForCategory.addBudgetItemToMonth(month, amount); } public void doReport() { Double budgetTotal = 0.0; for (String category : budgetItems.keySet()) { YearlyBudgetForCategory budgetForCategory = budgetItems.get(category); System.out.println("Budget for [" + category + "]"); Double yearlyTotal = 0.0; for (MonthlyBudgetItem monthlyBudget: budgetForCategory.getMonthlyBudgets()) { yearlyTotal+= monthlyBudget.getAmount(); System.out.print(monthlyBudget.getAmount() + "\t"); } System.out.println("\rYearly total for [" + category + "] was [" + yearlyTotal + "]"); budgetTotal+=yearlyTotal; } System.out.println("\rYearly total for all categories was [" + budgetTotal + "]"); } public static void main(String[] args) { Budget budget = new Budget(); budget.addBudgetItem("Tacos", JANUARY, 300.0); budget.addBudgetItem("Tacos", JANUARY, 120.0); budget.addBudgetItem("Tacos", FEBRUARY, 30.0); budget.addBudgetItem("Tacos", AUGUST, 30.0); budget.addBudgetItem("Burritos", MARCH, 40.0); budget.addBudgetItem("Flamethrowers", OCTOBER, 120.0); budget.doReport(); } } 
At work, I have two. At home, I have only one. That makes me sad.

Wow. That looks really good. It's a little more advanced than what we are learning so I'm going to look through it and use it as a guideline and see if I can condense it down. Thank you so much though. Hopefully this will help end the sleepless nights this class has given me.
Optional options?
&gt; I need to put a String of words into an ArrayList There is no such thing as a "String" of "Words". You can have an ArrayList of Strings, where the strings represent and store the words, or you can have an ArrayList of Word, where Word is a new class you create. Can you give more details from the problem description?
I would recommend a 1920x1200 widescreen plus another monitor. Ideally maybe two widescreens. If not, 3 cheap 1600x1200 non-widescreen can work too.
This has nothing to do with the ArrayList and everything to do with the definition of class Word. If Word has a .length() method, you're fine (just change "`String w = words.get(x);`" to "`Word w = words.get(x);`"). Otherwise Word probably has toString() overridden, so you can do "`String w = words.get(x).toString();`" or something. You haven't shown class Word so I can only guess what it has.
I use just my notebook's display: 15.4" at 1440x900 resolution. No problem so far I guess. 
1) It looks like your Scanner class is parsing your String wordList, into individual words. Therefore, you're words= new ArrayList&lt;Word&gt;; is wrong, and needs to be set to: words = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;; and your definition would also need to be changed: private ArrayList&lt;String&gt; words; 
ArrayList&lt;String&gt; means an ArrayList&lt; Containing Strings&gt; or of type String. 
I used to use 3 at my old job. One for email, one for main task, and the third for reference materials. My new job I only have one. :-(
A more accurate answer is all parameters are pass by value, but the value passed for arrays (or any object) is a reference to that array. Here is an example of how that works. public static void main(String[] args) { int[] a = new int[] { 100 }; test(a); System.out.print(a[0]); // Prints 100, not 200; } public static void test(int[] x) { x = new int[] { 200 }; }
You need a BudgetItem class first; class BudgetItem { String category = ""; // You should be using BigDecimal for monetary amounts // but we'll stick with double amount = 0; } Store your BudgetItems in an ArrayList in your Budget class. Then you only need an array of category types to run thru your items. 
At work I use 2, my laptop screen for my email, my 23" for my work. At home just my laptop
Lots of people at work here have 3 with the center one being a 1920x1200 24" turned 90deg for viewing long bits of code
[Yup](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1006655/are-java-primitive-ints-atomic-by-design-or-by-accident).
Hi - if it is indeed the case that MS needs to make the change, I can't even hazard a guess as to how long it'll take - at least not until we hear back from them. However, I can say that our director now knows about the problem and has asked for us to initiate contact. I doubt that the bug priority on our side will change though (since we can't do much about it), but I'll try and follow the discussion with MS and get a feel for their sense of its importance. Feel free to ping me if it seems that progress has stalled. jeff dot dinkins at oracle dot com thanks again
I feel sorry for you
If you want to go the multiple monitors route, do not make the mistake of just buying another one. I kind of works, but not as well as two monitors of the exact same model, bought at the same time. Here are things that will bother you in the long run if the monitors are not matched: * Different color balance; you will never get it quite right * Different DPI; the same window will have a slightly different size on each screen * Different vertical positions; this can be corrected by putting stuff (old papers...) under the foot of one monitor...
1920x1080s are the cheapest due to HDTV crossover manufacturing.
Just in the interests of offering a counterpoint: I have three different monitors and none of this stuff bothers me (well I do have books jammed under them to get them all at similar heights). I can't deny that I'd like them to all be matched but it's not the end of the world. Sorting out the line of stuck pixels in one and 6 dead pixels in another would be good too! It's just there always seems to be something more important to spend my money on.
Yes; one for coding, one to see the result, one for the inevitable Reddit that would otherwise take up one of the other screens...
As another poster put it, the work can be soul crushing and mind numbing. But there seems to be an increase in demand lately for java engineers. Security clearance or the ability to get one easily (ie clean background) makes it easier to apply to more jobs. I don't get much exposure to entry level positions so I can't comment on those jobs. There is a healthy mix of defense and private. Remember, there are many lobbyists and corporate headquarters here also.
velocity is just a java library for rendering content. Think JSP but without the need for a servlet container. It is super light weight, I actually use the same tool to generate bodies too. Ninja edit: generate **EMAIL** bodies... velocity doesn't kill hehe
One? Do you even have your own table and chair or are you using an old door and some leftover milk crates?! :)
Just having a quick peek and I may as well write down a few notes as I see them. Apologies if anything comes across as negative - this is the kind of thing I'd put in a code review at work and by the nature of the process it focuses only on the problem areas. - Comment on the constructor doesn't say much. - You don't need to initialise the instance variables to false or null in the constructor as those are the default values anyway (only method variables aren't initialised with defaults, instance variables always are). - Should probably throw an IllegalStateException (or something custom) if trying to play when there is no file loaded. - I might have split the file handler / lib wrapper bits from the actual runnable part. - You null check file in pause(), stop() etc, not sure if this makes sense as you can't have called play() without a file. Possibly this is a structure issue - it might be easier to check that a valid file has been provided and return a mp3 object that can only ever be in a valid state. Once you are dealing with a known object you can be confident that everything is in a valid state and you don't need to deal with null checks and the like. - You catch and log in the play() method but personally I'd also throw a runtime exception. - Again looking at all the getters and setters it seems to come back to creating some kind of mp3 player object. I'd expect to write something like Mp3ObjectThing readyToGo = Mp3ClassThingy.loadMp3("path.mp3", iwantItToLoop, setTheVolume... etc); Have to stop there as it's dinner time, but hopefully that was some help. On the whole though it looks good - well documented and clear code and I learnt something about playing mp3s. Good job.
I like two better than one, but a widescreen 24" monitor gets the job done for me as a single monitor...2 is nice because you can pull up javadocs without minimizing anything and see them with focus on eclipse.
If you just want PDF, take a look at [iText](http://blog.codecentric.de/en/2010/08/pdf-generation-with-itext/) You can create nice looking templates and then populate the fields at run time. At my old job I wrote a Hibernate/iText layout engine that spit out PDF. I used XML files with rules about the header, footer and the sizes and order of the fields. The hibernate pojos would implement an interface to provide the engine with a few hints and each report would be a child class of the abstract base class that held the engine. It assumed lists of objects that implemented the ReportRow interface. It even did summary/detail reports. There was way to much boilerplate (one XML, one new class and a few methods in the pojos; and I'm sure I would cringe if looked at the code today) but we ported about 60 reports, many of them pretty complex in less than 90 days using it. Might still be in use for all I know. This was before iText's PDFTemplate which does everything I would have wanted. Good luck. 
I had to give up my second monitor and revert to just my laptop display. My cubicle is not designed well for anything, and with 2 displays I was constantly turning my head to see one or the other. Net result: daily headaches emanating from my neck muscles. I loved the productivity I had with 2 displays, but it did not offset the physical discomfort.
Two at work, nearly two at home. I really wouldn't want to go back to a single monitor. [Nearly two because the second monitor is broken and so the bottom 1/4 - 1/2 is unusable. It's always at least a quarter that is totally gone, but does vary...]
I have two monitors on an arm, and then my laptop is on a stand to my left. At home I usually only use two monitors with my laptop closed (since I don't have the convenient stand at home), and I feel less productive on just two! email stays open on my laptop, web browser on my left monitor, code on my right monitor.
Only one. 27" Dell UltraSharp. 2560x1440. Makes two monitors unnecessary. Got one that was 6 months old off eBay for about $700. Worth every penny.
BAM http://i.imgur.com/HU4Vh.jpg It really depends on the monitor size. I can live with a single 1920x1200, but I really like having 2 of those, turned sideways. Great for looking at 2 code files at the same time, one on each. Also, standing desk.
I'm only 13 i have a 21.5" mac and a 19" screen to my left so i can use skype and browse reddit
Reinstall the files in a different machine to the same location, then copy the files over to where they were before.
Blargh I have a shared cubicle. It's a 20" iMac.
I like [this person's take](http://infovegan.com/2010/08/18/manage-pixels-not-monitors) on the multi-monitor debate. I believe there is an optimal number of pixels (the article cites a figure of 2500x1400) that are needed to complete tasks efficiently, and that doesn't necessarily translate into multiple monitors.
So, wait. I'm sorry. I'm a little confused. You have an array of class names? And if a user selects a class, you want to run that class? What does that even mean? A little more detail would be much appreciated.
Three at the moment. It's really useful, because every display holds another important window, which saves time for windowmanagment.
I prefer to roll just like [this!](http://imgur.com/UAfX9) 
Yeah, I kinda of hate that though. 120px loss on the horizontal is just enough a loss to be annoying, and also, that extra space is good for the controls if you are playing a movie and want the controls on bottom, etc.
Not sure what that means, but this makes some sense: MyInterface[] objs = new Object[] { new Class1(), new Class2() }; Then to loop through and call a method: for (MyInterface obj : objs) { obj.methodDeclaredInInterface(); } Cheers
I recently turned my two 20" monitors on their side. Still getting used to it, but I love it for working on code. You can see much more of the file at once this way. [side note: I have been having some issues with our apps 3d graphics 'freezing' the display to various extents, seemingly since switching to a vertical layout. Sometimes I even have to resort to doing an alt-F2-alt-F1 to get it unstuck. Is it just me? Nvidia Quadro FX 4800, driver 275.36, RHEL 6, KDE4.]
I use four: two on a Linux box, my laptop, and a monitor connected to the laptop. It seems like, the more monitors I add, the harder I have going down in count.
I haven't been around Java for awhile, but a simple search found an answer that might work for you. try { Class theClass = Class.forName(arr[0]); //arr[0] = "Class1" YourClassType yourClass = (YourClassType)theClass.newInstance(); } catch ( ClassNotFoundException ex ){ System.err.println( ex + " YourClassType class must be in class path."); } catch( InstantiationException ex ){ System.err.println( ex + " YourClassType class must be concrete."); } catch( IllegalAccessException ex ){ System.err.println( ex + " YourClassType class must have a no-arg constructor."); } http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=113
That's how it is done. Please note that you'll have to include the package "path" along with the class name.
you don't have to have the options.. i think.. sigh :(
sorry about being vague! i shall try explain as best i can.. each item in an order has the optional choice of fire resistant, colour(none, 1 or 2) and chemical resistance. it also required the user to enter a depth and length.. after this you can add the item to an order..
I think a better approach would be to have some common interface for the functionality the OP needs, and have `Class1`, `Class2`, etc. implement that interface. Then map his class names to instances of the classes that provide that functionality. For example: public interface PieceOfFunctionality { public void doSomething(); } public class Class1 implements PieceOfFunctionality { public void doSomething() { // do whatever class1 does } } public class Class2 implements PieceOfFunctionality { public void doSomething() { // do whatever class2 does } } Then map instances of those classes to their names, or however you want to map them: Map&lt;String, PieceOfFunctionality&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;String, PieceOfFunctionality&gt;(); map.put("class1", new Class1()); map.put("class2", new Class2()); // etc .... String userInput = // get user input PieceOfFunctionality function = map.get(userInput); if (function != null) { function.doSomething(); } 
Could you explain a bit more about what you're thinking. At least the category...android...desktop...what category of app...
OK! Thoughts and questions: * "none", "1", and "2" are really awful descriptions of colours so i wouldn't be caught dead using those... ;) Surely there are better names for them? * What do you mean by chemical resistance, and what unit do you measure it in? * "Box" and "Item" are still really unspecific terms... ;) * If they are boxes, surely they also have a width? Anyway, for a first draft i would do something like this: class BetterNameThanBoxOrItem { private boolean fireResistant; private BetterNameThanBoxOrItem.Colour colour; private ChemicalResistance chemicalResistance; // dunno what unit you measure this in? private int depthInMm; // or possibly width? private int lengthInMm; public boolean isFireResistant() { return fireResistant; } public BetterNameThanBoxOrItem.Colour getColour() { return colour; } public ChemicalResistance getChemicalResistance() { return chemicalResistance; } public int getDepthInMm() { return depthInMm; } public int getLengthInMm() { return lengthInMm; } public enum Colour { TRANSPARENT, // "none" HOT_PINK, // "1" OCTARINE // "2" } } This might be too inflexible if these sets of properties change too often, but as i said it's a first draft. 
I'm always interested in things to work on outside of work. Extensive experience in web-based, desktop, and android apps. As a graphics designer, why are you posting in /Java specifically?
&gt;So far i have worked out that you would have a abstract class of product and then a subclass for each type.. but i am struggling how to turn this into a program with different .java files! You've literally just described all the .java files you'd need! Every class (usually) goes in its own file in Java.
I'm interested in making apps. I'm so interested in it, that I've spent 8-10 hours a day writing apps, for the past 13 or so years.
I like using two, because I normally write Eclipse plugins. So one screen will be for the code, and another for the runtime Eclipse -- super effective in debugging. The second screen is also good for browsing, although I'm sure if I had the resources &amp; desk space, three would be brilliant (albeit distracting).
&gt; Another more correct way to put it is that ints are passed by value, and array object references are also passed by value. This is exactly what I was trying to convey, I just couldnt get the right words at 2am ;p
I have two currently, but would prefer 3! It is really useful to have a reference display and a scratch space display in addition to the primary workspace.
I like that office. Very industrial!
You need a much, much better approach. Talented software engineers are approached by at least 10 people with "ideas" in any given week. I'd suggest you learn to write software yourself. The people who have the best ideas already can.
After at least 12 years of using two monitors at work, I finally got a second at home. Surprisingly, it's not as useful as I thought it would be.
If you run two 1920x1200 monitors, I recommend putting one of them in portrait position. It's much better for reading documentation, while landscape is perfect for eclipse.
Thanks for the critique! I'll get rid of initializing the variables and write a better comment for the constructor. The null checks are only necessary because if a user called .mute() and then .play() it would be muted. But I guess this doesn't matter much and can probably be removed. I could rewrite it like you said, and have an MP3Object. It would make more sense. But it's not so much an audio library as it is just a simple way to have music in Java. There are a lot of options in the MP3 SPI and JLayer for doing more with the audio, and it is set up similarly to your example. But keeping this simple is my goal. Thanks again for your critique!
Two monitors (laptops screen and a second monitor). I used to go side by side, but now I work over under. Its easier for me to glance up than to the side I guess.
I have my laptop and a 27" display. Works out ok. About 2/3 of my users are on laptops at either 1280*720 or 1440*900. The rest are on 20" or 27" displays. I tend to keep the web browser on the laptop to make sure the app I am working on fits. Before I moved to a laptop I have a pair of 17" displays. 
Went from 2 19" 4:3 to one 24" with the magic of linux multi-desktops. [ctrl]+[alt]+direction to switch desktop. 1 for coding, 1 for research, 1 for packaging and deployment needs. No desk clutter.
Actually, ArrayList&lt;Word&gt; is an object of type ArrayList, but it may contain only objects of type Word.
What I've had is various 3D apps rendering incorrectly when the window spans both screens, like viewport calculation was broken or something. Switching the order the monitors were plugged in and re-arranging the desktop order fixed it. So it's totally believable that multiple rotated monitors are a poorly tested edge case. GeForce GTX 260, assorted versions since last year through the current. Windows Vista, Windows 7.
This is something I wrote at my last job. It uses iText: http://door64.com/blog/n/27901 Basically, write up reports as a webpage, then let this do the heavy lifting to PDF.
You just blew my mind with the whole portrait position deal. I'll have to invest in a 3rd monitor.
Hey, the door and milk-crate desk is baller. You shut your mouth! (Actually, I prefer filing cabinets, they're sturdier than milk crates.)
Always two. Usually one for my IDE and one for javadoc of any class I might be using. No matter how much I program in java, the javadoc and internet are still invaluable tools.
I have two in work and the second one just gets used to put stuff on to stop annoying me (like people who IM). At home I have 27" thunderbolt and I prefer everything just on that.
Agreed about using interfaces for the classes being created, but the potential drawback to using a Map to store the classes in is that you need to know all of the classes at compile time; by using the newInstance() approach new classes can be added to the classpath at runtime. That said the chances are the Map approach will be sufficient for what the original poster requires, and anything beyond that will be over-engineering just for the sake of it.
Okay, this is starting to make sense.. the colours are not actually defined by the user at all, it's just a choice of do you want colours? if so; one or two? chemical resistance will just be a boolean yes or no. this project isn't too much detail, it's more for the understanding of OO programming..
that kind of hit me last night.. i think what the confusion is over is the layout of the code, how to create the instances of a product etc..
Don't use double or float ever for this kind of thing. Integers or Longs can be used where the value displayed is actually x10^-2 or in other words displayed with a decimal 2 places over. Ideally BigDecimal should be used.
2
That illustrates the point also. A method can make changes to the array passed in, but still it can't change the variable pass in by the caller. Java, since it has no "pass by reference", does not allow one to do a very common function in other languages... swap. public void swap(int x, int y); public void swap(int[] x, int[] y); I guess my overall point is that Java does not have "pass by reference". It only has pass by value. But since all object and array variables are references, it does indeed pass references by value. 
It does, but it is dependent on how long the "// do something" bit takes to execute. Sun solved this problem though by including [a Timer class](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/swing/Timer.html)
Hey, I'm pretty sure you could do a for loop. Just do: for(int i = 0;i &lt; strings.length;i++){ if(strings[i].equals("class1"){ run class 1 } then make an if statement for each class... Actually now that I think about it this may not be what you need, I found it a bit hard to understand what you actually want so I hope I could help...
Maybe not everybody wants a big screen. 
I've done exactly that but realized my if statements were getting too long so wanted to get rid of if statement and run a class based on what the user has input. basically wanted to do something like for(int i = 0;i &lt; strings.length;i++){ // run the class name that the user has input } 
Hmmm, alright, have you tried to have your program run the other class based on the string you're getting? It might be worth trying... Or have you considered a switch statement inside your for loop? Sorry I can't be much help.
found it easier to install this one on mac JD-Eclipse Java decompiler http://java.decompiler.free.fr/?q=jdeclipse
You can use the Robot class: http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Robot.html
I think [java.util.Timer](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Timer.html) would be better than javax.swing.Timer. (And if you want to get really fancy, there's [ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.html).)
Well, suppose you want some information about a topic (and suppose the info isn't available on the internet), so you ask me, and I say, "Go to the library. They have a book about it there." Then you ask, "How do I get to the library?", so I grab a piece of paper, write down the street address of the library, and hand you that piece of paper. Now you can drive to the library and read that book (or scribble in the margins if you are a bad library patron). Suppose, though, that I already had the library's address written down on a piece of paper, and I don't want to lose that piece of paper. So I grab the paper, slap it on xerox machine, and make another piece of paper that also has the library's address on it, and I hand you the copy (not the original). This doesn't mean I've created another library. The library exists, on its own, out there somewhere, in a common space that we can both access. A duplicate of the library *could* be created, but duplicating the piece of paper with the library's street address is a separate thing. In Java, when you create an array and give it a name, and when you put that name as an argument to a function (or assign it to another variable), you are dealing with something more like the piece of paper than the library. Strictly speaking, it doesn't have to be this way and it is a bit inconsistent, but it is a practical decision that the creators of Java made basically because (among other reasons), arrays are *big*, and making copies of them might be impractical, so when one is created, everybody gets to share it (by default). So, you might ask, why copy anything? Wouldn't it be more consistent to copy nothing and just share everything, so that an `int` is treated just like an array? Well, you could definitely do that, but on some level, under the hood, computers work by copying things. In my analogy, I described physically handing a piece of paper from one person to another. A computer can't do that. Inside a computer, generally speaking, nothing actually changes possession. Things are basically always just copied (although sometimes this requires erasing something else). So when dealing with small things, copying is more efficient because if you wanted to allow someone else to modify something instead of giving them their own copy, that's actually more work (and thus makes the computer slower).
Well basically looking to form a game company indie style with a bunch of actually fun game apps. I have artwork designed and I have some ideas of how the game would work out. It would involve tapping the screen and sliding things around on the screen. 
lol'd at "perviously".
Whoops, yeah you are right! I was too quick when I googled Timer javadoc. In the end the advice is the same, someone has conquered this task before. 
I seem to the rarity: I have 4 in a 2x2 grid. 1 for eclipse, 1 for Notepad++, 1 for email/IMing/interneting, &amp; 1 for PGAdmin. That's at work. At home I just have 1 :(
on a different note, do you think writing a for loop yourself is better than using a Timer class ? ( or a ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor (this one sounds good, I'm gonna have to check it out... )) because you can SEE what the code is doing ... ? plus it's smaller ?
Eclipse auto fill feature
http://thenewboston.com Great video tutorials. He breaks them down very simple. Around 80 beginner videos and a bunch more advance ones including game development.
Nice critique. I'm just going to add one more thing. The method calls in the example class could be a bit smaller. For example the large output statement that prints the sysouts could be refactored into it's own method call. The numbers could become an Enum class as well which will make the if else check into a switch statement. Never really used Github and it's about time I got to understand it but just can't seem to check the project out as a Java project. I'll get there lol.
sorry, on a retard keyboard.
And?
At home I use one, but it's 30inches, also since it's a mac I don't have the same OCD to maximise all the windows that I do when I'm using a PC. At work I had a choice of 2 widescreen 20inches or one standard 22inch - I picked the 22inch. I prefer to have vertical space rather than horizontal space on windows. Ideally though I would have preferred 2 standard screens, even if they were slightly smaller (19inch or such)
Quick and dirty would be to put all the characters you want to type into a Map with the string value as the name and the int key code in the value. Then look them up one by one.
and what?
Could anyone now get me two games.java with the alpha beta pruning and minimax, i need to compare the two.
Yay standing desk! [Here's mine](http://imgur.com/7U4Bl).
Thanks again. You're been great. I'll e-mail you in a month or so. If you'd like me to help with anything or just want to send me an update then you can reach me at hans at enterprisedt.
Ah yes, thanks haha. That unfortunately doesn't solve my problem
You can't sort a primitive array using a comparator. There is no method Arrays.sort(int[], Comparator), which is why you're getting the error. Just change int[] to Integer[] and you should be fine. As a side note, you should try to avoid recomputing the integer bitcount in your Comparator.
Awesome, thanks for your help!
We have the same keyboard.
You need to display it. Use: firstFrame.setVisible(true);
I thought it didn't work anymore...
Play is pretty sweet, there's also Lift. And Scala can make use of the java libraries.
Ha! That's awesome! I actually just use my laptop keyboard now. I tried out the MS keyboard but found I prefer the laptop.
Yes, we've only been using it for a month, pretty sweet so far.
Indeed IIRC, Play 2.0 is written in Scala.
Thank you for responding. I literally found the answer about 5 minutes after I posted. I felt like an idiot when I did, but then it lead to the next question under the Edit: part. So either way I'm gonna learn something. lol. Thanks again for the response. 
This for ekblaw's class? 
To answer that question: If you have multiple JFrames, for whatever reason, multiple windows or something, you can hide them. Also, you don't want it to show before you have it all set up, so you typically do setVisible() when you're done configuring it.
Makes complete sense. Thanks again for all the help. I really do appreciate it! 
Haskell, obviously.
No experience with apps on phones but I'd be willing to help on the non phone specific API, or If you did do this I'd love to be able to keep up to date with how this goes.., im making a small game in my spare time at the moment and my worst part is making graphics
It's mainly because it looks really ugly if you show the window and can see the components draw. Rather you have it appear once all the components are done drawing. 
On a semi-related note, why don't you have an exit, such as firstFrame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE)? I ask because I was taught to always add that.
This was towards the beginning of the chapter, and I was still "learning". I have since then find the exit... that sounded funny. I usually read through a chapter, and then reread it piecing everything together in Netbeans as I go for a more hands on experience. 
I think that's a great way to learn. I love it when you teach someone a code snippet and they go: "but what if I do this..." I think you have the learning style down.
If you're going to do a lot of HTTP stuff, it might be worth looking into [Apache HttpClient](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/index.html). It can be a bit daunting at first, but it has an enormous amount of options (hence the daunting part) and performs quite well.
Cool stuff! If it helped, select his answer as the correct one.
Idk if the offers still on the table but I would love to give it a shot. I just got done making a GUI bot for Justin tv chat with plugin support. Now I have no projects to attempt so...
Yes.

2 23' Dell at work and one 24' Dell IPS at home ( plugged to mac book pro - but it always closed and I use desktop keyboard with it). I spend years with dual monitor setup(One for browser\ssh -second for Eclipse) - so now it my only option when I working. 
As someone who absolutely hates dealing with graphics, I find this to be a wonderful idea.
Yeah this shits fucking brutal I can't stand him 
well you inspired me to write a mass downvoted to piss off my friends. hardest part is creating the accounts now but i think i figured that part out
well i did for like 10 accounts. they are stored in a .txt file and it reads from it to get the user/pass. it does the same thing for the proxys. 
oh and the fact that reddit only allows you to make a new user every 10 minutes thus the program will help when its finishes since it will randomly go through a proxy 
Paste the message please 
We need code and/or error message to help.
Added it to the post.

From the [docs](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html): &gt; To allow subtypes of non-serializable classes to be serialized, the subtype may assume responsibility for saving and restoring the state of the supertype's public, protected, and (if accessible) package fields. The subtype may assume this responsibility only if the class it extends has an accessible no-arg constructor to initialize the class's state. It is an error to declare a class Serializable if this is not the case. The error will be detected at runtime. &gt; During deserialization, the fields of non-serializable classes will be initialized using the public or protected no-arg constructor of the class. A no-arg constructor must be accessible to the subclass that is serializable. The fields of serializable subclasses will be restored from the stream. Now, I don't know about the objects you are serializing, but right now this looks like a good lead.
http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/serialization/ Scroll down to Version Control
&gt; "java.io.InvalidClassException: Konkurrencesvømmer; no valid constructor" Is the key here. While normal serialization does not require a valid constructor, you can come into that situation when a super class of your class is not serializable. Which means that "Konkurrencesvømmer" (whatever that means) has a direct or indirect super class that is not serializable. Also make sure you define [serialVersionUIDs](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1,5.0/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html) on your classes.
You, Sir, are a gentleman and a scholar. The problem was that I didn't have constructors without arguments. There are still some problems, but I don't get any errors. Thanks agan!
At home I have a single huge one (2048x1536), and at work I have two tiny ones. I certainly prefer having a single big monitor. At my previous company I also had a single bigger one, which was very nice. That said, it's often nice to be able to tail logs and look at docs and stuff on a separate monitor, but that doesn't necessarily have to be as good as the primary monitor (if you're strapped for cash).
This article, while having some topical information, looks like an veiled advertisement.
I know. He's such an asshole. Never responds to emails and just yells at you if you don't understand a question. His assignments and labs are garbage. I know other people who took the class with different teachers and they say it was way easier to understand.
Correct, but why are you telling me this?
-.size() will be anything imported from java.util.collections and .length will be arrays.
Windows ME, trust me, that plan works
Jasper with IReport is a simple and very powerful solution. It just takes a few lines of Java code. The rest is all using IReport Visual Designer to create an XML that can be read by Jasper.
 Here is an example of the Java code needed to run a report created by iReport //JDBC connection Connection connection = establishConnection(); //Create a run time parameter if desired HashMap jasperParameter = new HashMap(); jasperParameter.put("parm1", test"); //Run compiled file jasperReport = (JasperReport)JRLoader.loadObject("web/jasper/testFile.jasper"); jasperPrint = jasperPrint = JasperFillManager.fillReport(jasperReport, jasperParameter, connection); JasperExportManager.exportReportToPdfFile(jasperPrint, "web/jasperOutput/fimsParam.pdf"); 
I'm just hoping I pass this shit so i can move on with my major. 
Okay, well I've got it working by using Event.LEFT/RIGHT/UP/DOWN but I'd still like to know why the code above doesn't work. I'm sure I'm missing something simple. Also, I'd prefer to be able to use WASD instead of the arrow keys.
This article is fairly devoid of real discussion or content. We all know lots of startups don't use java because it's not "cool".
What is the output?
 Superclass constructor running Set value of field myValue to 69 Value of myValue field is 0 
If you're using an IDE step through the code to see what's not having the desired effect. Been a while since I played around with reflection, but at a guess the "f.set(this, m);" line isn't updating the myValue field (in your System.out line you're calling "m.toPlainString()", rather than "f.get(this)", meaning that this non-assignment is being masked). **Edit:** Just looked at it again, and the above's wrong - you're setting the field's value in the superclass's constructor, which then gets overwritten when the field is instantiated in the subclass. In other words you're setting the value to 69 before the ReflectionTest class's default value of 0 is set, hence the output of 0.
One for every object I synchronize on. 
I read the code and this is the output I came up with. But, since you evidently came to the same answer, why do you need the output explained? Was this answer provided for you (or did you execute the code?) or did you come up with it on your own? 
I would guess that the surprise is in the last line indicating that the value is 0 rather than 69. 
I believe your issue is that you're unaware of the order that the constructors are taking place in. In your example code, the BigDecimal is being set to 0 after it's been set to 69. There is no error taking place with the reflection. See here: http://www.java2s.com/Code/Java/Language-Basics/Orderofconstructorcalls.htm
Same. Working my ass off to barely pass. The class is a joke.
The issue is because of the way the protected BigDecimal is declared. The constructor executes correctly, but then the instance variables are initialized and myValue gets overwritten by the BigDecimal constructor. change the line to read: protected BigDecimal myValue; Problem solved.
You beat me to it!
Look at the documentation for [Robot](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/Robot.html). The methods you'll be most interested in are keyPress, keyRelease, mouseMove, mousePress, mouseRelease, and mouseWheel. The others you can mess around with, but aren't really needed for pranks. You'll want to import InputEvent (for mouse buttons) and KeyEvent (for keys). Remember that pressing a button leaves it pressed down. You'll generally want to press and release. If you want to press multiple at once, you press them all and then release them. You may want to use [MouseInfo](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1,5.0/docs/api/java/awt/MouseInfo.html). With it, you can find the current position, and other information. Also look into [ProcessBuilder](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/ProcessBuilder.html). It can be used to start programs running, though it's a bit more complicated to use than Robot. Some prank ideas: Use any combination of key presses, mouse clicks, and mouse movements. Delay these so they only happen on irregular but lengthy intervals. This will be increasingly annoying, but hopefully not to a degree that whoever is being pranked sees it as more than their own fault (typos, accidental clicks, etc.). You can have this gradually increase in frequency. Small mouse movements on their own are also good, especially if you're using MouseInfo to move just a little bit from the current position. This is more obvious, but you can have processes open up (such as a browser) and do things with them. Have a browser open up with an embarrassing site. Don't bring up anything that would get someone in trouble, though. You could bring up notepad and type something. Randomly press capslock. Log the user out (windows key, arrow keys, and enter). Hold shift down for random lengths of time. Change whether it's pressed every few seconds or so. Bring up notepad and leave taunting messages. There's tons of stuff you can do. Good luck, and have fun, but don't do anything destructive. 
That's the thing I find weird. I didn't expect the superclass constructor to be called before the object had been initialized by the subclass. i.e. public MyClass() { // You might think initialization happens here super(); // but in fact it happens here [ your code goes here ] } The fact that my constructor code is invisibly interrupted after the call to super in order to perform field initialization is a surprise to me. I thought field initialization happened before my constructor was called.
No, that's not the issue. See below. The issue is that I wasn't expecting field initialization to happen in the middle of my constructor code.
This is a pretty tired point of view at this point, but I think we must be selling the technology short if we all believe that there isn't a rapid prototyping approach available in Java or at least in the Java ecosystem. I haven't done a tools selection along these lines, but I've heard ideas like [Play!](http://www.playframework.org/) and others promoted in the past.
No, it's the same thing. The constructors are specifically the class's constructor, the superclass's constructor and a member variable's constructor (ie. field initialization). It goes Super -&gt; Member Variable -&gt; Class. I agree that it doesn't make much sense particularly when you explicitly call the super class's constructor.
Full example for clarity: https://gist.github.com/1368490 Output is: Superclass constructor called Value of field myValue is null Subclass constructor continuing Value of field myValue is some string I find that surprising for the reason explained in the code comments.
Constructors get called from the highest level (i.e. Object) down through each level of subclass; the call to the super constructor is always performed at the start of each class's constructor (hence why the call to super() has to be the first line in the ReflectionTestSuperclass constructor). I don't know the detailed ins and outs of constructors, but intuitively it makes sense for default values in a class to be applied after the call to the super class's constructor has completed, since prior to the this happening the current class doesn't really fully exist (since its foundations haven't been laid down). Additionally your code example muddies the water somewhat by using reflection in the super class to initialise a value in the subclass - it's not something anyone is likely to encounter in a real life usage scenario, as there's no way that the super class can know for sure that the myValue field (or any items in getDeclaredFields) exist.
Ah, but [it also happens if the member variable has no constructor](https://gist.github.com/1368514), i.e. is a primitive such as int. It's not an order-of-constructors problem, it's a field initialization happening at an unexpected time problem.
Yeah, sorry my example wasn't as minimal as it could have been. (Mind you, compared to the real world code, it was very stripped down.) [Here's a really minimal example](https://gist.github.com/1368514). Primitive values only, and no initialization of anything in the superclass. And the real world code works by using reflection to check whether the appropriate fields exist. I took out all that detail for the sake of clarity.
Right, but in the actual code, the data was coming from some other system. There may or may not have been a value for BigDecimal at runtime, and I wanted a default of 0 if it wasn't otherwise overwritten.
All keys have a keycode. You can use any key like so int key = e.getKeyCode(); if ( key == KeyEvent.VK_W) //do stuff VK_A, VK_D, VK_S all work.. 
Someone should really tell Mojang.
You should also look into buffers if you're trying to get the character to move smoothly. 
Good to know; thanks!
Yeah, the flicker got old. I've got one going now.
Great. Got the character moving and a double-buffer going. Now my challenge is trying to get the character moving diagonally. I set up movingUp/Down/Left/Right variables that switch between "Yes" and "No" whenever a movement key is pressed or depressed, and then made this method: public boolean moveDiagonal(String movingUp, String movingLeft) { if (movingUp == "Yes" &amp;&amp; movingLeft == "Yes") { manHorzPos--; manVertPos--; } return true; } That seems fairly cut and dry, and would expect for it to do the job. But it doesn't do anything. Why? I'm also confused about whether or not it is necessary to declare parameters and/or a return type for such a method. Sorry that all this is really basic. I'm in Java 101 right now!
Thank you so much, I just realized at &lt;Word&gt; was the class. I thought it was just a type of variable like int or String, makes much more sense now. There was a method in Word to get the length of the string so it worked out perfectly. My computer science teach got caught with bringing alcohol to school the other day so he's gone but he didn't really teach anything. He told us to look things up on the internet or in the countless books he had, but we weren't allowed to ask him questions or he'd get mad. Thanks again.
I tried your code and the compiler complained that it could not find the variable "e", in "e.getKeyCode()". Do I need to define it, or import some classes first?
Nevermind; got it.
I recommend using numbers, for instance If(left) Xspeed = 20; Then update with PosX += Xspeed; same with y Also, return type is needed unless u declare void, as opposed to, in your case, boolean Public VOID update() { }
I have fun programming in [Java...](http://www.threadbombing.com/data/media/39/sad-puppy.JPG)
Keep the up and down in a If else statement and the left and right in another. eg if(key==up) y++; else if (key == down) y--; if(key==left) x--; else if (key == right) x++;
[Me too](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nugRd9s8kf8/TeDoOHhEhMI/AAAAAAAAAyw/Q0hTHJDZVCA/s400/sad%2Bpuppy.jpg). I find that I can rapidly prototype with Java as well as I can with any other language (except maybe web apps with HTML/PHP). And what's wrong with being verbose? I'm never confused about a method or class and Eclipse can turn a 20-character method call into three key strokes pretty effectively.
== is very unreliable to compare strings. This only compares the memory location, not the actual content of the strings. You could use use the String class' .equals() method, but it would be much easier to make movingUp et al. booleans to simplify the program and make sure there aren't any comparison errors.
I don't think I understand what exactly you want to accomplish. You are saying your print method has access to the single instance of Database you are allowing. I think in this case I would have a getter for the HashMap and pass the Database to the print method. Inside this I would call the getter and iterate over the HashMap (or whatever you decide to return). class Database { public List&lt;Table&gt; getTables() { return database.values(); } } public void printTables(Database db) { for (Table t : db.getTables()) { System.out.println(t.getName()); } }
tl;dr = GPL + Java rocks &gt; In the meantime Java daddy Gosling - who worked briefly at Oracle just after the Sun acquisition - remains optimistic that it's the community that will keep Oracle honest. He also seems to feel Oracle itself has changed in its handling of Java and the community. &gt; &gt; "In its latest chapter, I'm really impressed by the way that Oracle has behaved: their reputation and history are clear, and yet the strength of the community that they have to work with has kept them in line. Java is far stronger today than I would have predicted two years ago," Gosling said.
This might not be doable in this very program, but in the future if you want something moving the same speed diagonally you have to make em move 1/sqrt(2) horizontally and vertically. Pythagoras Theorem then gives you the speed 1 diagonally.
Regardless of the merits of the arguments (I don't think there were any in this article), I have a hard time taking people who use "then" when they should be using "than" seriously.
Yeah, but then I would have to have a second method for printTableXML() which would be too similar to printTables. I already had my professor complain about that one. I've actually come up with a solution that I'm in the process of coding right now. So we'll see how this goes. 
Of course "cool" goes out the window 5 years later when your main developers have left and you need to pay an incredible amount of cash to another developer to maintain the code written in something that never really took off. 
Rename the field "database" to "tables" since it contains the tables, then just create a method Collection&lt;Table&gt; getTables() { return tables.values(); } on Database. 
Yeah, but that breaks "rules" of information hiding. 
Two things - You need to put braces around the items beneath your if statements: if (nextValue &gt; highestValue) { ... } Also, the else if statement is completely unnecessary. Other than that you're just missing a closing brace for your main method and your class, but I'm sure that you just didn't copy/paste those.
So far so good. You probably don't need the else statement, because it doesn't really do anything.If the values are not changing you don't need an else statement. Does a user enter the values? I would suggest prompting the user to enter values at appropriate places. Such as the value for the first month before the loop and for subsequent values in the loop. The logic is fine, and you appear to be about 2 minutes away from making it work. What specifically do you need help with?
Could you give us the rules and requirements of your assignment please? If you mean that you don't want the caller to modify the Table objects, you need to copy them or provide an immutable view of them.
You were really close. Just made some minor changes to your code import java.util.Scanner; public class Temperature { public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in); double highestValue = Double.MIN_VALUE; int highestMonth = 1; for (int currentMonth = 1; currentMonth &lt;= 12; currentMonth++) { double nextValue = in.nextDouble(); if (nextValue &gt; highestValue) { highestValue = nextValue; highestMonth = currentMonth; } } System.out.printf("Highest Month was %d with %.2f degrees", highestMonth, highestValue); } } Doube.MIN_VALUE is the lowest double value there is. If you preinitialize "highestValue" with it you can just take the first evaluation into the loop, too. Your blocks where malformatted. Each block needs a { and a }. The indentation is for human eyes only in Java. The compiler totally ignores it. The logic for your else if block was botched. If the new value is higher, you have to remember value and month. Otherwise there's nothing you need to do. Also added outputting the final values. Now if you start this per command line, you can enter 12 double values separated by return and you get the highest value. Did not manage to get this working in eclipse. 
This doesn't have anything to do with diagonal movement, right? It's just a cleaner/better way of writing the code?
Yes, I switched to using a manSpeed variable, because I want to be able to easily modify movement speed based off of armor and status effects. I also used your += operator; hadn't seen that before. What's the point of giving a method a boolean/return true;, rather than just making it 'void'?
Ah glad I helped. There's also *= and -= ect. When you give a method a return value it basically acts as, for example, a. Boolean variable, like If(player.collision()) Player.manSpeed = 0; And below collision would be a method Public Boolean collision() { If(shape.contains(playerX,playerY) { Return true; }else Return false; } In that example "return true" is nearly equal to setting a variable collision to true Also, in case it does NOT contain the point, we need a default value, so you have to add the false at the end (you don't need the else part, but it makes it easier to understand: whenever you return, you quit the currently running method and return to the piece of code that called it)
Check: http://www.reddit.com/r/learngameprogramming/ This subreddit was created for a University of Reddit class on game programming. Unfortunately, after only two lessons the moderator gave up. But you will find good example code for 2d character movement: http://pastebin.com/hAzbit1t 
"whenever you return, you quit the currently running method and return to the piece of code that called it" Ah.That's good to know. Does that mean that 'void' methods run constantly?
The code does move it diagonal because it can sense if up/down is pressed and if left/right is pressed as well it will move (In this case Up and right are pressed and starting location [0,0]) to [1,1].Sorry if I've confused you, but have a try with the code to see if it works for yourself. 
Thanks a bunch. I wasn't expecting to be very close at all. Will make some changes when i get the chance &amp; try those suggestions.
Any guesses on how much time will pass before this is the standard app server?
Or in the title of their article, forget to include an apostrophe in "isn't".
Thanks, I'll check it out.
void methods are different in that they don't require a return TYPE, u can use a return; otherwise it runs the method once through and then returns automatically at the end. Void methods are called on their own lines of code, if it isn't void the method is basically just an advanced variable(it can do some calculations to find out what the number should equal to avoid having to do calculations elsewhere) I'm usually not a very good teacher.. Example: Int age = 11; Int currentYear = 2011; Public static void main(string args[]) { System.out.println(birthYear()) } Public int birthYear() { Return currentYear-age; //this section would not be run because we already returned } Assuming age and current year were defined this would print out 2000
