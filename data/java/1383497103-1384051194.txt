Yes, the reason I caught and rethrew the NumberFormatException is because it fit the error, and I wanted to provide a custom message. I felt it provided more fine-grained information than simply allowing the standard exception to propagate.
Thanks for the thorough critique! * When you say to separate out the logic from the printing and reading input, do you mean to separate the printing and reading input from each other as well? * The class for Properties is a good idea. * The redundant variables were for readability; perhaps they don't make as much of a difference as I thought * As for assigning a method return to a value before using it, I prefer to call the method once and use the stored value rather than calling it multiple times, when I know the value will be unchanged. Is that bad practice? * The validateState method was my attempt to implement a class invariant. I know that's not necessary with immutable classes, it was just something I wanted to try. * The redundant error checking is, again, not necessary for a class (outside of it's constructor) only takes in instances of itself. I was trying to get into the habit it of checking input for all public methods. * javapractices (and Code Complete) mentions using assertions in private methods to catch states that are not expected to ever happen in normal operation, i.e. the program has been broken in some way. I agree this was redundant for this class. Again, thanks for taking the time to look over my code. I'll refactor it using your recommendations.
*ControllerTest* * This is more like an integration test than unit test (not that there is anything wrong with it), as it combines the user interface and actual calculations made in Particle class. If you want to learn TDD, you might want to learn about isolated unit testing and mocks. * Lines 17 and 24: While it's popular to name @Before and @After methods as setUp and tearDown, there is actually no reason to do so. You could also give them a descriptive name such as setOutStream. * Line 24: What does setting System.out to null do? It doesn't seem to be a documented feature. * Line 31: Test method name does not communicate, what the test actually tests. You'll only need to type the test name once, so you can use as long method name as needed to communicate the intention of the test. * Line 38: It is questionable, if this local variable adds any readability value. I think you could just as well use the expression directly as a parameter to assertEquals and save some lines of code. *ParticleTestHappy* * I'm not certain of the value of testing simple accessors (i.e. get* methods), but if you want full coverage, then you can of course test them. * Line 18: Don't test more than one reason for failure within one assertion. It's actually a good idea to have different reasons for failure in separate tests. If you have just one equality tested per assertion (or test), use assertEquals instead of assertTrue. * repulsionForceWith is the only operation with some substance, yet you only test it with one simple test. You might want to cover some corner cases (e.g. positive, negative, zero, min and max values and so on). *ParticleTestSad* * Line 7: INVALID_INPUT_LOW doesn't describe, which input it is. You could use e.g. INVALID_POS_INPUT_LOW. * Line 14: You can get rid of local variable p and just create the particle without assigning it to any variable. Then you don't need to suppress the warning. * Line 48: testRepulsionForceWith doesn't test anything, as you have already established with other tests, that invalid input cause exception to be thrown. If there are no "sad" cases for this operation, just leave it out.
This is quite a trivial program, so it's probably overkill, but you should try to use a more MVC approach. You're already half way there, you have a Controller, a Model (Particle.java), but no view class. You've intertwined your "view" code with the controller class. This makes it more difficult if you want to display the code in a different way, e.g. HTML or in a unit test. As to how to do it, well there's no need to have a getInputs() method and serveOutputs() method, as the controller can act as a black box and take inputs and return an output.
That's funny that you should mention MVC. I've been using Play! lately, but using an MVC approach to CLI never occurred to me. Good idea! And yes, I agree that it's trivial. If you look at all the other answers in the challenge thread, most people did it in one or two functions.
&gt; When you say to separate out the logic from the printing and reading input, do you mean to separate the printing and reading input from each other as well? There are lots of ways to achieve the separation, but at least if you have a separate class, then it's most likely ok to just dump all UI related code there. If you have them in controller class, then just do what seems most clear to you. &gt; As for assigning a method return to a value before using it, I prefer to call the method once and use the stored value rather than calling it multiple times, when I know the value will be unchanged. Is that bad practice? I think it can be a bad practice, if you do it without a thought. It can (and in some cases should) be used as an performance optimization, if the method call is costly, but in many cases (especially here, as we're talking about simple accessor method) this is a premature optimization. Optimize first for readability, and for performance only when it's either measured or obvious enough to be a bottle-neck. The readability cost of having an extra local variable is tiny, but even small things add up, and in a bit more complex program you don't want any extra readability burden. &gt; The validateState method was my attempt to implement a class invariant. I know that's not necessary with immutable classes, it was just something I wanted to try. As I said, I don't think there is anythin wrong with validateState. Just that you have the same validation code duplicated several times. The point of class invariants is that you check them at creation, and then again if you have an operation that changes the state. There are no such operations here, so calling validateState at the creation should be enough. &gt; javapractices (and Code Complete) mentions using assertions in private methods to catch states that are not expected to ever happen in normal operation, i.e. the program has been broken in some way. I agree this was redundant for this class. It's a good practice to do so, but you need to know when and how it should be used. You can also use normal exceptions, including AssertionException (which unlike assert statements cannot be turned off) to signal all kinds of unexpected situations such as pre-condition or class invariant violations.
I mispoke earlier. ControllerTest was intended to be an integration test. Regarding TDD, have you read Kent Beck's book on TDD, and could you recommend it? I'm still new to formal testing, so these are all useful tips. Thanks!
I have not read Beck's book. Just browsed briefly, but that's not enough to make any judgement. TDD itself is pretty simple process. It's the unit testing and designing for testability, that can be challenging from time to time. I could recommend [Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided by Tests](http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/), which covers TDD and a couple of related advanced topics.
&gt; I had thought, from what I've read, that exceptions are better for methods that take inputs from outside the class, while internal methods can use assertions because the input should already have been sanitized by an outward-facing method. I guess that's pretty good approach. From technical point of view, it doesn't matter if throw an AssertionError or use assert statement, except that assert statements can be turned off. Projects I have been involved with haven't had such tight correctness requirements that there would be need to do redundant error checking. Actually if you need to do such thing, you're probably in some marginal life-critical domain or your classes are too complex, so keeping track of input validity is made unnecessarily difficult.
It seems to becoming a theme now in development. I think all the new blood are against it, as they should be.
Hmm... The problem is in Java you have to use "System.out.println" This is way more complicated than "Print" in some original Basic for DOS program. Java's version involves streams, objects etc. Hello World was OK in the past, but now it is lingering based on its history. Perhaps a program to add two numbers, but then how do you handle the output? Maybe no output. I think that the basic program that beginners should be able to do is: * enter a number * if the number is negative print out something * if the number is positive, print out the next 10 numbers. This program shows how to use input, output, if, and for. 
Yeah I was thinking about adding numbers initially. But then realized that I'll have to explain how to pass arguments, how to parse String into number, and then anyway using System.out.println is unavoidable :) May be I underestimated beginners. Thanks for recommendations though. I've started writing the next chapter which I devote to numbers, math operators and variables. But I agree, hello world in java is much more involved than compared to similar hello world in python, for example.
First, I'd decide where you want your career to go. For example, do you want to be working on the front-end of a website or do you want to get your fingers deep in the server-side code? From that you can make a list of technologies and concepts to learn about. For the UI side I'd recommend picking up MVC, MVP, plus a few different web frameworks that work very differently e.g. Tapestry, JSF and GWT. Don't bother too much with the specifics of the APIs and syntax, understand why they work differently and when you would choose one over the other. Learn to make a simple CRUD application in each and you will gain a decent level of understanding on them. If you do e.g. GWT using their preferred MVP design pattern (which I recommend btw, it's very easy to follow and code for) then you'll find that writing native UI code like Spring and SWT a breeze as they are very similar. For server side Spring is an absolute must, hibernate is very useful. A basic knowledge of SQL is useful as well as the more recent nosql dbs like mongo. If you want to be an architect then design patterns become more important. Until then I wouldn't worry about them too much. Given enough time most people "invent" them for themselves then when they later read about them it's a case of "oh yeah, that's similar to what I did on that app years ago". :-) Most importantly you need to get across the perception that you are genuinely interested in keeping up with new technologies and that you do this in your free time because you enjoy it. This can pay off big for you, my present job involves mostly technologies that I've never used professionally much but I'd mucked around with them enough to know enough about them Finally, you *do* need to know the difference between an arraylist and a linkedlist, unfortunately that's very important for writing new code. An arraylist is very fast for lookups by index but is horridly slow for inserting elements into the middle of the structure. Linked lists are more "expensive" in terms of memory and are slow to pick out the n^th element but adding an element into the middle costs much the same as appending one to the end. You should also know about the copy-on-write list structures like CopyOnWriteArrayList which you'd use when you are writing highly threaded code that doesn't modify the list too much but reads and iterates it a lot. 
MVP is much better than MVC imho, it's a far more logical way to split things up and with the View containing nothing but UI elements you can mock it out and do 99% of your testing in uber-fast unit tests without needing to resort to much slower and more fragile automated UI tests. The view also contains only abstract concepts like HasClickHandlers and setMyResult("xyz") so you can port the app to new UI frameworks or even have a different set of view impl classes for tablets, mobiles desktops and native apps. There's a great presentation on it [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kilmaSRq49g) from google as it's the preferred design pattern for GWT. See also [this article](http://www.gwtproject.org/articles/mvp-architecture.html) of theirs. 
I doubt this is possible without resorting to some JNI binaries. If something is not present across all hardware then it's not in the JVM. A x86 motherboard beep is very specific to the hardware. None of the things you tried *should* beep the motherboard. The AWT toolkit will play audio over whichever UI the user is using, the computer might be running multiple X11 remote displays and it ought to only go to the user who called it. Sending ascii 007 to the terminal will only beep the UI as well, it's not supposed to beep the motherboard as the expectation is that the user is connected to a server somewhere else. Simplest solution would be to find a simple binary program that makes a beep for you then exec it from java on demand. 
Also try reading some books. I recommend Head first design patterns, clean code, clean coder, effective java, and growing object orientated design guided by tests. There are some good videos on garbage collection on YouTube posted by the user java, these will give a good understanding of the internals of the jdk. And you might want to have a read about data structures after you watch the garbage collection video as it will make more sense. A lot of interview questions will ask about hashmaps. 
It won't help your problem, but your title reminded me of this clip from Joe vs the Volcano. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AYUB3tQs80
Fucking homework dump. If you can't handle this, then just give up now. Real world code is 1000x more difficult.
If you know what your problem is and can write up a reasonable description of it, why not ask here on /r/java or [stack overflow](www.stackoverflow.com)
You remember the scene in The Dark Knight when the accountant attempts to blackmail Lucius Fox? "Lucius Fox: Let me get this straight. You think that your client, one of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world, is secretly a vigilante who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands; and your plan, is to *blackmail* this person? Good luck." Let me get this straight, You want to copy code and from chegg.com a website that hundreds of others have referenced before. Your plan is to submit it as your own work, to a professor who knows java and could easily create a crawler to check for patterns? ..... Good Luck. I would be more then willing to help teach you how to do it. I looked at the problem and it is not a hard program. With a little bit of time and motivation to not be lazy you could have done the assignment. I could care less if you want to be lazy though in fact I love people who are. People like you who wait till the last minute to do programming are the people who do not make it. This means more jobs for people who are willing to work. If you want to see it cause your stuck on some little part you should have just asked for help on that. 
In short, you're a great imitator and to be fair, much maintenance work is done that way. However, if you aren't researching the underlying reasons that explain or even justify the code you're writing, then you're missing out. The "standard developer" is what you're doing now: [Blub](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(computer_programmer\)#Blub). Move beyond that level by working on understanding the reasons for each choice. SOAP vs. REST isn't even an interesting question really, but aren't you even curious why they both exist when really, we only ever needed one of them? Can I use XML with REST? Why or why not? What you seem to lack friend, is curiosity. Rediscover that and feed it in everything that you do and you'll have what you need to work yourself back to where you want to be.
Isn’t there /r/please-do-my-homework-for-me-because-i-am-way-too-lazy for that?
&gt; Is my experience common, or am I just unusually shit at my job? Everyone else is being nice and helpful so I'll go the blunt route: I'd expect a developer with 5 years exp to be MUCH better off than you. It sounds like you've spent the last 5 years not writing code, I'd say you have 1-4 months of real Java experience. You get the skills you need by actually writing code. And just so you know, code reuse is NOT copying and pasting and then tweaking a bit. Code reuse is about creating general purpose code that can be applied in multiple situations. If you are copying and pasting you aren't achieving code reuse and you also aren't learning anything so stop it. Give yourself a goal that demands you write code from scratch or you will never learn. You only learn how to program by programming. Blog about a pattern a week, get a certification, start an open source project, anything.
I would recommend working on something fresh in your free time, like an Android app. Will make you work on something different and you will run across online tutorials and problems you need to solve that will teach you new things.
guys leave him alone, he's just wants to get better at java. He probably has a bad teacher.
Meritorious though the subject may be, that headline is atrocious.
Agreed, time (survivability) is the ultimate test of maturity. Though time itself has done DBCP no favors and even Hibernate has dropped support for it. 
That sums up my feelings too - It's impressive stuff if it works as advertised and I'll give it a try on smaller projects but I'll be wary of using it on anything too important before it's been proven for a while. I've got to admit that I'm also made a bit wary by their FUD on the correctness page that Hibernate 4.3 doesn't work with BoneCP when their own link shows that the issue was fixed in both 4.3.0.Beta1 and 4.2.7. It's admittedly true that BoneCP isn't behaving strictly correctly here but the Hibernate bug states that the behaviour was common enough across environments to warrant being worked around in Hibernate.
This process is different for every object, as they are all sorted by a different parameter. For the example you added above, which parameter do you want to sort by? Or do you want to do it by some mathematical operation on all of them? After you figure that out, then you would write a method that performs this operation, then returns to you the value that you calculated, which you can then use to sort the objects.
What should the correct way of organising this be then? The View handles input and output to/from command line. So it has the main method? It then calls a static method in class ParticleController, which does the creation of the particle objects and calls a method calculateReactionForce on one of those objects.. The ParticleController's static method returns a double/String which is the value to be output to System.out (in this case)? Edit: My setup if needed: [ParticleController](http://pastebin.com/6yGqwuwL) [Particle](http://pastebin.com/RjV0sKvh) [ParticleView](http://pastebin.com/QysJqzRY)
*[You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_GeQR8fJo)*
Just keep learning new things. Go back and freshen up on the old stuff. See if you can spend a year or a few months re-learning all those basic concepts from the university, and do something different like an Android app or a Django site.
So cool! Comparable is easy to implement! If ALL you will ever need is to know the largest, I would implement an index in Music. private static int largest; public Music(...) { if [size] &gt; this.largest this.largest = [size] } It has it's faults. It spends CPU time (little by little), up front. It also adds 'n' ints to the heap. However it should take less total time than one search, and less than 1/2 the time of two searches!!! :) Maybe I'm a geek, but I don't use variables anymore. I store everything in Cassandra. ;)
McGill?
I.. wouldn't do this. First of all, you need to make sure it's thread safe, plus this will only work for a single collection. This is a problem along the lines of the Singleton anti-pattern. Much more straight forward to do this externally by implementing a Comparator.
Dump them all into a SortedSet with a custom comparator.
I work on all three... Almost EVERY blueray/streaming device on the market is powered by JavaME. Most DVR devices are powered by JavaSE (Motorola etc...). There are SO many examples as to make it difficult to know where to start.
It bothers me that people can identify gaps in their knowledge, even at a basic level, but not bother to rectify it. It would take 2 minutes to read the java documentation which tells you in detail how these structures work and what they are useful for. Someone without that level of initiative would indeed be a red flag in an interview because I'd start to wonder what else they don't know, and that in the future they won't bother investigating further when they need to know about it.
Thanks!
I think they should fix it as ASAP as possible. 
Tough love, I like it. It's possible OP has a major case of impostor syndrome, but if his or her description is accurate I totally agree -- Copy/paste coding is not acceptable and probably not fooling anyone.
When is a connection pool ever the bottleneck? Maybe this isn't aimed at my use cases. I would also be interested in seeing the CPU graph for the database server.
to be fair they're not poking bytecode or something like that, they just modify their own code based taking the java bc as a feedback

Most of the Java work I do right now at my day job is client side, with Swing still the UI choice. Obviously, there's a load of server side Java going on, I just don't happen to be doing any in my current gig. Now, on my *own* time, I do both client side (Swing for non-game, libgdx/OpenGL ES 2 for games from a UI perspective) and server side (mostly raw sockets, but I'm exploring use of more "mainstream" server side Java for my purposes, as well). I'd love to mess with embedded Java, as well, but a) I don't have a use case right now, b) other than Cherry Pie I'm not sure how easy access would be, and c) my other favorite language/platform is C, which lends itself better to most embedded applications.
 Collections.max( music, new Comparator&lt;Music&gt;(){ public int compare(Music m1, Music m2){ // compare only the fields you want. // (m1.a) will be 'autoboxed' into a Double class // and then will use it's comparable method. return (m1.a).compareTo(m2.a); //The following are also equivalent /// return new Double(m1.a).compareTo(m2.a); /// return m1.a - m2.a; } ); // end call on Collections.max. Know what it means for an object TYPE to have a 'natural ordering.' The code above creates an inline anonymous class derived from the Comparator class as the second parameter; to be used for that function call alone, for only that one time.

No, we would not like to pay for an open source project.
Your dao should only be responsible for persisting the data. Your service layer would normally be responsible for any data manipulation. If your application has anything like a sane architecture, Easymock or similar will do what you need.
I'm not sure exactly what you're after, but I prefer Mockito over EasyMock. It has an ArgumentCaptor class that might help your cause.
Thanks for this, it's certainly a good starting point. It also touches on a question that's come up for me for a while - is there any way to actually be a halfway decent software if you just do programming from 9 to 5 as a job and don't spend your free time doing it? I've seen opinions on both sides of the fence, but it really seems like there's no way to learn everything one needs to know just on the job
In this particular example I did go and look it up after it was asked of me and I realised I had no clue, my problem is more about the "unknown unknowns". I had no idea that this was something important that I did not know before it was asked of me, and I have no clue what other important things I don't know now Don't worry elephantgravy, I wouldn't hire me right now either! After all, if someone hasn't put the effort in to learn something before a job interview what are the odds they'd learn it later? Hence why I'm trying to pick up what I can now. Better late than never, eh?
You need to think outside the IDE. A unit test that will run on some build server somewhere is worth its weight in gold. The time it takes to specify the input data vs the debug time later on is an eye opener. 
The way I would approach this is have [unit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) and [Integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing) tests. In the unit tests I would use something like [mockito](http://code.google.com/p/mockito/) to mock out parts of the design - e.g. I might have a dao to do raw pull and something to assemble the data into structures, I could test the assembler by mocking out the dao, you could test the dao by mocking out the database components (though most people leave this to integration testing) Then I would use [fitnesse](http://fitnesse.org/) to test it all hangs together - creating fixtures to populate tables, call the API and check the results. The table structure of Fitnesse makes visualizing the data for this sort of tests quite easy, there are various tools to help you to integrate fitnesse with a database e.g. [DB Fit](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dbfit/), [fixture creator](http://sourceforge.net/projects/fixturecreator/) 
Curiosity I have, but it tends to drown in a sea of ignorance. It's sort of like speaking a foreign language - If you speak good french and someone says a french word you do not know, your first instinct will be to find out what it means and add it to your vocabulary. But if you speak basic french and hear words you don't understand constantly it's impossible to remember and look them all up and you might end up just worrying about following the gist. I think once I understand enough to put the things I don't know into context, I will feel more passionate about understanding new things I discover
You could always load the data from a file before it hits your service layer?
Who the hell would like a scrapper, when pastebin itself already has a [nice API](http://pastebin.com/api) ?!
It certainly depends on the use case. No answer is correct for any question if you must account for any ex post facto requirements, such as handling multiple threads. Comparable and Collections are great, however I'm certain there is a use case where they wouldn't work, or would work very inefficiently where another solution would work very well.
Interesting. I always enjoyed working with/on Glassfish (since 2.x at least), and still do, but I guess that lack of commercial support will make it a tougher sell for many projects.
You can use Double.compare(m1.a, m2.a) if you're obsessed about performance and want to avoid autoboxing.
There is something like you want. It's called [AspectJ](http://eclipse.org/aspectj/docs.php). You can define a "pointcut" around methods that you specify, which will cause the code defined in the pointcut to execute before the actual method. You will have full access to the parameters, and you could write the parameters to a file, perhaps to write a filled in method call. Aspects are a very powerful and very dangerous technology.
All that's true, but besides the point - he was asking how to find the largest value of the objects stored in an ArrayList. Your proposed solution searches far too broadly, and will give the wrong answer any time his ArrayList doesn't include the JVM/classloader record-holding instance.
So first, you'd need to provide a getter method for a, called getA() that would return a for use in the comparison. You would get a for two objects to compare them, then depending on the algorithm you use, place the appropriate one in the place it belongs. You can also use the getter method to implement comparable and write a compareTo method, which allows for you to use Arrays.sort()
News at 11: Holding a free and open product in one hand, and a commercial product in the other, Oracle drop the free and open one like a hot potato.
The issue is because every connection pool wraps not only the real Connection, but also Statements, and ResultSets, every time you call any method on any of those objects (Statement.execute(), ResultSet.getInt(), etc.) there is a performance hit. Pools are checking things like if statement logging is enabled, etc. ORM like Hibernate which by nature have to call getters for every field on every object to load them are particularly affected. Now that I think about it, ORM actually add another layer with their own proxies to detect dirty state and perform lazy loads.
Writing was on the wall for Glassfish ever since Oracle bought Sun. Thankfully development will continue and there's still JBoss if you want a commercially supported but open source Java EE container.
Unfortunately there's still some issues with JavaFX on OS X that don't exist with swing, namely related to the system menubar. (You can't add About/Preference options to the application menu, which is a big blow to the Mac UX).
The article says GlassFish 5 will still be the reference edition for EE 8.
java.awt.Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().beep(); http://lmgtfy.com/?q=java+beep ... ah, you've tried that...
Indeed. A much better argument would be an insanely complete test coverage with integration tests for every possible database, every possible version, and every possible JDBC driver version.
&gt; Better late than never, eh? Absolutely. I didn't mean to be discouraging if I was -- just trying to help narrow down some of the "unknown unknowns". It's good that you are humble, self-aware and want to improve, that's missing from a lot of people in the industry too.
The page claims Maven support, but it's not in Maven Central. Anyone know what repo has it?
Which DB are you using? You could construct a *SELECT* query that loads the data you want to *inject* into said method and make the DB dump it into a CSV. I think PostgreSQL's graphical tool can do this, it's been a while.
You can create &amp; use a session if you need to via HttpServletRequest.getSession See [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/909185/jersey-security-and-session-management) for an example. Also, have a look at [Shiro](https://shiro.apache.org/) for managing authentication &amp; authorization.
In the cases I have seen, authenticated ReSTful services use one of the following: * An authentication token passed as either a GET param or a POST param * Username and password parameters via either GET or POST I have never seen anyone do authentication (I.E. HTTP Basic Auth) and then use state to authenticate for subsequent requests.
Yeah, I have seen the same. However, I would contend that cookies (read: headers) are no different than form variables or query strings at the end of the day--and passing a cookie called JSESSIONID is pretty damn close to passing an authentication token as GET or POST. Not trying to be argumentative, just passing along my thinking as to why I'm fine with just letting the container do all of this for me. :)
I would not say that you are being argumentative. I can certainly see where you are coming from, but I am off a mind that what you are trying to do wouldn't fit the definition of ReSTful. 
Most rest apis are really rpc anyways, heh. 
Check, I understand how to use the session object. I guess I just didn't realize I couldn't session scope the resource. This whole container managed object lifetime concept is entirely foreign to me still--just trying to wrap my head around where it belongs and where it doesn't. edit: replying to your edit, I will look into that. right now I am using whatever netbeans started me off on, but I will get into those weeds soon. thanks for your help.
Gotcha. It is a bit of a challenge at first (so many damn options hah) but the payoff is worth it :) Good luck to ya!
Only a while now until all the Java RI's fall through Oracle's hands like they did with Solaris/zfs.
also, don't javadoc shit just to javadoc it. If the variable names are obvious, don't waste bytes by writing the obvious.
Yeah haha. That chunk of code emits a beep that the OS would normally output through the speakers
I did come across a chunk of code that made the mother board beep through C. Ill probably look into running that code from java.
Don't know why you were down voted, filling up DTOs with getter and setter comments drives me nuts. At my current gig, the style is to comment every security fix, in the code. I'm tempted to just place a link to "little bobby tables" at the top of every DAO.
I think there is just too much hate for Oracle. If any other company open sourced their software there is praise. As stated Glassfish is still the Java EE reference server. Oracle has been a competent steward of Java. Since they took over improvements and releases of Java have accelerated significantly.
&gt;In some rare cases it would be nice to have 2 different methods: one for the string value (toString()) and one for the debug info (toDebug() or toDebugString()). The method could be defined in Object, with a default implementation: calling toString(). I have had similar issues in the past. In general, what are the thoughts on something like this? Obviously, adding this to Object directly isn't really an option, but how do you handle this issue, where you have multiple interpretations on how you might want to turn an object to a String?
GlassFish Server as we know it today is deprecated from a full blown product to a toy product. [R.I.P. GlassFish - Thanks for all the fish.](http://blog.eisele.net/2013/11/rip-glassfish-thanks-for-all-fish.html)
First thing that grabs me – consistency with capitalisation in text would be nice: &gt;This section of **java** programming examples of JavaTutorialHQ is intended for IT students and professionals seeking for examples that deals with NIO API. Java introduces a new I/O using the **java nio** packages. This document can serve as a rich source of **java** programming source codes that can help in learning **java**. While I appreciate there are likely going to be further posts, I really cannot condone describing this as a "rich source of java programming source codes". Leaving comments such as the one below makes the examples look rushed. // TODO Auto-generated method stub Using IDE generated exception-handling completely sidesteps discussion of what *could* go wrong when using this code and how such situations should be handled. Printing stack traces is a poor excuse for error handling. catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } From my brief look, there are also no links to [official JavaDoc](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/package-summary.html) or [Java tutorials on NIO](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/fileio.html), which also serves to irritate me. Those who wish to share knowledge of APIs should understand their responsibility to prevent 'copy-paste coders', by encouraging reading of proper documentation as well as providing code samples. &gt; We are a group of professionals working in IT industry and this site will reflect our respective domain knowledge particularly with tibco and java. We are showing concrete example source codes that you can readily modify to suit your needs. This provides the final nail in the coffin. Firstly, if these examples serve to be representative of others on the site, they are not the work of professionals. Either this doesn't properly reflect the quality of the authors day-to-day work or they should not describe themselves as such. Additionally, encouraging modifying such simple snippets of code to your means reeks of bad practices. In my view, a true professional would be aware of many of the points I've raised here and wouldn't have published such a poor quality resource. **TL;DR: There are much better resources to use than these, including those linked further up in my comment.**
Glassfish has been open source for some years already.
I'm not familiar with windows 8, but the first step with any browser problem will be to test with other browsers. Try Internet Explorer and Firefox, and see how they behave. Do they have the same problem as chrome? 
Same problem. Java ran fine until Windows 8.1 and Java 7. http://imgur.com/46qOtoo Java console.
/r/techsupport is a better place to ask. This sub is for happenings and such with the development side of Java.
Ok sorry, didn't know that.
Gotcha, so sticky sessions are the hang-up for you. I love the idea of the container managing all of this complexity for me, but I admit using sticky load balancing would feel like a trip back to the 90's. It's probably a non-issue when using carrier-grade iron but in EC2 it's an anti-pattern. Thanks for the input.
Oh god no. You really should not be debug printing - ever. Familiarize yourself with a real debugger for maximum java skillz. You're right about the formatter pattern.
&gt; Can a package (shipped as a jar file) that has a Main-Class defined in its manifest still serve as a library? Yes. &gt; Do I simply include the jar file itself in the classpath in order to use it? Yes. &gt;I'd like any packages that serve as libraries for larger projects to build into executable jar files with their own command line utilities which will be used for unit testing (when I run 'make check' the unit tests will run.) Is this something that is even possible? Yes, it's possible. However, instead of building the tests into the library JAR, I'd make a regular JAR for the library, then make another JAR for the unit tests for the library. That way your library JAR is smaller, and it makes sure that any special settings or mock classes that you use for testing can accidentally make their way into the real running system. &gt; Can jar files contain other jar files? They can, but with caveats. Technically you can put anything in a JAR file, even other JAR files - however, those packaged JAR files are *not* automatically included on the classpath. Depending on what you're trying to do, the solution could range from extracting everything and re-jarring it back into one file; extracting the JAR into the file system and then running it, or to use some kind of special classloader when the app starts to load the classes from the packaged JARs. This can get complicated, so what you probably want to do instead is just make sure everything you want is on the classpath. &gt; How can I package application data in a jar file and have it still find it? I assume this is a simple directive in the manifest file, but I'm unsure which. What do you mean by "application data"? Properties files? flat files? data dumps to go in a database? Properties files are usually packaged along with the code, because they're usually things like default configuration data or extracted strings so the program can be translated into other languages. I'd argue that actual program data shouldn't be packaged with an application other than some special cases. 
I work with A LOT of SMEs that sell testing tools to industrial clients. A good majority of these companies use Java for both client and server side solutions. A decent portions of the tools provided are also provided as Eclipse plugins.
Not sure if this is related, but since you appear to be using Applets, you'll want to make sure you review the [security level changes](http://www.java.com/en/download/help/jcp_security.xml) that Java 7u10 introduced regarding applets.
Instead of looping while repeating it might be easier (and safer) to hold the last character and a counter. Whenever the current letter doesn't equal the previous letter, add it (and optionally the counter when greater than 1) to an output string. This way it becomes an O(n) operation and handles the edge cases including when string is empty and/or all the same letters
Everything is fine regarding security.
First of all their is no need to ask twice. Parsing of numbers is relatively easy. (Should probably wrap these up and catch errors too:) ) String[] inputs = scanner.nextLine().split("\\."); int leftOfDecimal = Integer.parseInt(inputs[0]); int rightOfDecimal = Integer.parseInt(inputs[1]); //or Double input = Double.parseDouble(scanner.nextline()); Secondly you are doing the same work repeatedly. Much better solution would be to create method that makes this work generic. Dont do it for Gas and food and phone and misc separately. Create a method that takes the input value as a parameter and returns the string to be printed. I would also create a generic method for taking the input and separating it into left of the decimal and right of the decimal. This would greatly increase the readability and reduce the overall amount of code you have. Lastly and this might just be opinion but it is an opinion I would hope many people share. If you must create separate code for each case (which in your code I promise you you do not) Don't name things "quarters1, quarters2, quarters3..." ect. ect. if it is the quarters from gas call its "gasQuarters" or whatever but please avoid just concatenating numbers on to the end of a variable to reuse its name that is horrible horrible habit to get into. 
/r/java I think people also tend to like DZone (http://java.dzone.com/) although they don't tend to stick to Java.
In JDK8 it's javac, yes java compiler :) javac -Xdoclint Foo.java (run javac -X for options)
huh? My solution was to maintain an index of the element. It would require code to update the index, but it was a simple index.
ArrayList&lt;String&gt; musicArray = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;() ; To get data: musicArray.get(index) To add element: musicArray.add(element) ; To remove element: musicArray.remove(index); If you haven't done it in class I image you haven't done any thing with exceptions, which this will certainly cause if you don't know what you are doing with arrays or ArrayLists. If have the time to learn it for the assignment go ahead, as long as your prof won't dock you marks for not doing it how they asked. If you are going to learn it feel free to PM me with questions. 
You should never return `ArrayList` because it is a concrete implementation which nobody but your implementation needs to care about. Instead, return `List` if clients of that method need the objects to be in a specific order, or `Collection` (or even `Set`) if order is not important.
That's awesome! Does anyone know of a Java 6 or 7 equivalent? Is there a Maven plugin that works like this?
Agreed. A good variable name is infinitely better than a long javadoc diatribe.
That's cool. Any editor-independent ways to do this?
I prefer to use development tools and techniques independent of editor. That way, whether someone is contributing to my projects with Eclipse or IntelliJ or Emacs, we can still use the exact same tools and workflow. Right now, I'm using plain Emacs, not even the `eclim` package; and guard to do local continuous integration. I organize my Java code as Maven projects, and seek out Maven plugins to accomplish my desired build behaviors.
As the old adage goes, RTFM. :-)

Ah, its a course at my college. It was called Mobile Programming. I assume other courses would be named similarly.
http://java.dzone.com/ http://www.javacodegeeks.com/ http://www.javabeat.net/ http://viralpatel.net/blogs/ http://www.mkyong.com/ http://www.petrikainulainen.net/blog/ http://krams915.blogspot.ca/
Vanderbilt and UMD are making an Android dev course for Coursera. Not sure if it's up there yet, but definitely something to keep an eye out for.
My favorite is free @ thenewboston.com. Bucky (the instructor) is clear and detailed and gets pretty amusing at times. Most importantly he leaves out the 6 minutes of fluff that precedes most programming videos.
If you're using Eclipse or Idea you can simply right click anywhere inside the test method &amp; choose to run only that specific test.
Doesn't code academy have a course? I've found it to be a great, interactive way to learn languages.
That could be considered controversial. Many people argue that Bucky leaves out a lot of the fundamental concepts behind programming, so-much-so that he has made an appearence on [/r/learnprogramming's discouraged learning resources list](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_discouraged_resources). I, personally wouldn't argue this (in fact, I give major props to the guy after having introduced me to Java programming), but there are a [fair few people who argue that he is a bad teacher](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/11ubro/28_ways_to_learn_programming/c6ppc38). Nonetheless, OP should check him out. Just make sure you do a little external research after the videos. I learned the Java fundamentals from Bucky and would now consider myself fluent in the language. A lot of people like his learning style -- he's super layed-back and generally entertaining throughout his videos, and you'll enjoy watching them, but you might not learn as much as you would have hoped to.
That is true, I do that for debugging (in Idea). But this will plug into a continuous integration system which will instruct what method needs to be run, likely through a command line argument to main. I'm trying to figure out how I can programmatically do that using the objects and methods that TestNG provides with their API http://testng.org/javadocs/org/testng/TestNG.html. The only thing is that there is little documentation on the usage of each method and class.
Fair enough, though that seems like the exception not the rule based on personal experience. To take a step back, I personally would avoid establishing a contract that included setting a requirement for toString(). It just seems like bad practice.
No real help, but if javadb is still derby, then the last time I used it (which was over a year ago now) it was horrible. If you can move to something else, I'd recommend using either hsql or h2. No exaggeration, these were 20x faster for me.
John Purcell's on Udemy.
I agree with you. He is good if you are looking to pickup another language and you just would like to know how to do something however. I was switching from Java to C# and he made it real easy for me to figure out how to basic things without wasting time in explaining the concepts behind it.
You say that most rest api's are stateless.... ALL REST APIs are stateless. If you are using statefullness it isn't REST. So says the author of REST - http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm
Where can I find information on Java naming conventions?
Try a local university Java course.
You can use Guava to create arbitrary-length random InputStream using a fixed memory size: public static byte[] makeRandomBuffer(final int size) { byte[] buffer = new byte[size]; ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextBytes(buffer); return buffer; } public static InputStream repeatingByteArrayInputStream(final byte[] input) throws IOException { return ByteStreams.join(Iterables.cycle(ImmutableList.of( ByteStreams.newInputStreamSupplier(input)))).getInput(); } public static testStream() throws Exception { long limit = 1024 * 1024; InputStream is = ByteStreams.limit(repeatingByteArrayInputStream( makeRandomBuffer(1024), limit)); }
The Java Language Spec is a great resource: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-6.html
Not sure why this is down voted. The groovy beans is absolutely huge. It's what killed maven when gradle came out
Do you happen to know of a course of this quality for C#?
Have you looked at: http://download.java.net/jdk8/docs/technotes/guides/2d/flags.html You can try playing around with those configurations. I would start with the OpenGL property. My guess is that has to do with the openGl flag being defaulted at false leaving you with no other hardware acceleration options. It might already be on for the JVM that comes with Mac, or might not even be supported. I'm not sure how Apple handles their JVM. Java2D is a pain in the ass sometimes, but if you are careful with how you use it you can get it to pretty decent frame-rates. That said, I've heard some bad stories about Apple's JVM.
Def. recommend. I went through his course a couple months ago. I now bought like 6 more of his courses. I feel pretty confident for a beginner going through his course. :)
I've got the OpenGL flag set to true. I think the problem is just Apple - Java2D is great on Windows, but Apple is... Apple. I guess it's LibGDX for me. 
Have you tried using the OpenJDK 7 build instead of the Apple build of Java? Apple's version of Java has always been a source of serious pain due to their non-standard packaging and other OS specific tweaks.
Pardon, but it'd be nice if you told us why it was so awesome. I only see a link to github.
Hi, full disclosure: I am the author of JITWatch. It's a tool for visualising hotspot.log which contains information about Just In Time compilation decisions made by the JVM HotSpot compiler. You can browse the package tree and quickly find which methods were JIT-compiled and information about each compilation. You can plot charts and histos and also browse the bytecode and disassembled native code. The aim of the tool is to make it much easier to understand what HotSpot did during the execution of your program which might help track down performance issues or just give you a better understanding of the JVM at runtime. Up to you to decide if that's awesome ;)

You should probably learn a bit more about how the internet works before trying to make an auction site.
You should probably not bother commenting if you have nothing to add.
Thanks, this is the sort of reply I was looking for. I'll definitely make an effort to have a look at Ember/Angular. Most of the work I do is server side coding. 
Your multi operand switch statement will not work. Java only allows one operand of a countable (I think the technical term is cardinal) type. If you want to perform multiple operations, you need to perform them one by one (looping).
Gives me more options when selecting presentation technology. I've not started yet so I'll give all these options a look. 
Might want to have a look at Vaadin, works great as long as you're not building at twitter-like scale. Stay away from the death pit of tar that people lovingly call 'JSF'.
I'm just annoyed with people who go like "Hi, how can I make my java MVC website download updates in realtime? RSS, right?" and then never actually research their own problems, just go straight to some forums to have other people do their work for them. http://lmgtfy.com/?q=java+website+push
TestNG can be invoked as an ant task, with a lot of possible customization. Check http://testng.org/doc/ant.html
Your build system should be using this system so your not recreating the wheel and it works with either unit testing framework
Look into reactive programming with play framework, I went to a meetup where James ward gave a talk about exactly what you are looking for. I'm on my phone or I'd find it
I'll look into this! It looks like this might be just what I need!
Your code is wrong because you are missing a ")" (like the error message already tells) 
Um yes but where should I put the ")" in. Do you have any idea? 
The last line where there is only ); replace it with this: )))));
Here is the video http://vimeo.com/77576341 Thanks looks good, I will give that a watch tonight. I actually just skipped on the Coursera Reactive programming course (2nd part in the functional programming in scala) thinking I would do this project instead.
Most modern way would be using websockets. See [Atmosphere Framework](http://async-io.org/). There are sample codes of using it with Spring MVC Project. I've personally checked-out [this sample project](https://github.com/keaplogik/springMVC-atmosphere-comet-websockets), but that was like half a year ago, and the atmosphere framework has changed a lot in that time. Btw, atmosphere supports fallbacks if the client can't handle WebSockets -&gt; to Long-Polling -&gt; To forever iframe etc. 
Atmosphere is used by PrimeFaces and play. The company that created Atmospere has a partnership with PrimeFaces. The person who wrote Atmosphere wrote the initial Push implementation in PrimeFaces so it is very well integrated. http://blog.primefaces.org/?p=2934 
Asking people is a form of research. He did a good job in asking the question while stating his problem. I see no reason to troll him for it.
A couple of things seem wrong to me here. Firstly, why are you calling i++ twice? &gt; for (int i = 0; i &lt;= n; **i++, i++**) { You're summing from 0 to n in increments of 2, which isn't in the question. Then, you're numerator is wrong. &gt; return **convertToRadians(degrees)** * Math.pow(-1, n); The question just states (-1)^n. Also, this doesn't even compile: &gt; getNumerator(**Math.pow(-1, i)**); Should be more along the lines of: &gt; getNumerator(degrees, i); On top of that, your numerator / denominator line is wrong: &gt; cos += numerator / denominator; Should be also multiplying this by x^2n : &gt; cos += (numerator / denominator) * Math.pow(convertToRadians(degrees), 2 * i); Also, you don't need to declare numerator and denominator outside of the for loop, since they're never used outside it. There are also a few other bits and pieces that could be improved, but that should get it working. Edit: For the highest grade - http://pastebin.com/0TMhT1r6
Are you seeing an error from the installer? If you provide more information we might be able to help with java 7 installation.
Thank you! Could you please explain this to me? If it's not too much trouble.
Nope, it claims that it has successfully installed, but it doesn't recognize programs built for Java 7, and when I run a build made for Java 6, it reports that its still using Apple Java.
Ah I see it now. You used: String.format("%8s", Integer.toBinaryString(number).replace(' ', '0')); Instead of: String.format("%8s", Integer.toBinaryString(number)).replace(' ', '0'); Paren mistakes happen to me all the time.
so when you do a "java -version" it shows java 6. Did you try and set JAVA_HOME so it points to the newly installed java 7? 
Ohhhh, okay cool! Thanks so much! That makes a lot of sense! Thank you!
Yeah, I looked at it over and over again, and I couldn't figure out what he was saying for the first minute or so.
I don't know. jmh is nice but my framework is less focused about micro-benchmarks and more about comparing the performances of two (or more) codes. Here it is explained better: http://fillumina.wordpress.com/performancetools/ In practice I have found that knowing how fast it is a certain code on a specific machine (with a specific JDK, SO etc etc) tells me almost nothing. I want to know if a code or an algorithm is faster or slower in respect of an alternative. Did I improved my code or is it slower? Is it the better solution? And I can even put these checks in a unit test to make sure my assuptions stay correct during development! Here is an example to show how easy it is to write a test, just follow the lead of the template (it works as a stand-alone performance test as well as a Junit test): public class DivisionByTwoPerformanceTest extends JUnitAutoProgressionPerformanceTemplate { public static void main(final String[] args) { new DivisionByTwoPerformanceTest().executeWithIntermediateOutput(); } @Override public void init(ProgressionConfigurator config) { config.setMaxStandardDeviation(2); } @Override public void addTests(TestsContainer tests) { final Random rnd = new Random(System.currentTimeMillis()); tests.addTest("math", new RunnableSink() { @Override public Object sink() { return rnd.nextInt() / 2; } }); tests.addTest("binary", new RunnableSink() { @Override public Object sink() { return rnd.nextInt() &gt;&gt; 1; } }); } @Override public void addAssertions(PerformanceAssertion assertion) { assertion.withPercentageTolerance(7) .assertTest("math").fasterThan("binary"); } } And by calling its main() you'll get these results: Iterations: 1000 Samples: 10 Standard Deviation: 7.997750553879185 Iterations: 10000 Samples: 10 Standard Deviation: 22.840778409983503 Iterations: 10000 Samples: 10 Standard Deviation: 3.628900909423828 Iterations: 100000 Samples: 10 Standard Deviation: 10.10749740600586 Iterations: 100000 Samples: 10 Standard Deviation: 9.441978610152637 Iterations: 1000000 Samples: 10 Standard Deviation: 3.9505724269289453 Iterations: 10000000 Samples: 10 Standard Deviation: 0.3524486164596204 (10,000,000 iterations) math 0 : 20.09 ns 100.00 % binary 1 : 19.35 ns 96.34 % * : 39.44 ns EDIT: grammar and phrasing
Link: http://sourceforge.net/projects/doctorj/ Thanks, man!
Agreed. But both would be ideal.
The Checkstyle documentation is okay, but it leaves a lot of unanswered questions.
To add to the above, if you want 'push' based updates, you could look at integrating the [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere) framework which provides a number of ways of providing this kind of functionality (you configure preferred methods with fallbacks for older clients). I have only used this framework with Java EE (not Spring). I believe some of the larger third party JSF frameworks provide Atmosphere integration, too.
Fair enough, loses control of its application. Since you seem to be quite knowledgeable on the subject, can you give me the short version of how you would approach something like a shopping cart? It's entirely stateful and long-lived. Does rest give me an avenue for appending an element to an entity, as in the case of adding an item to the cart? Or should the cart remain in scope of the client and be transmitted in its entirety when it is being mutated? Honest question.
You have two options that you could use. In the first, you could have Ant generate a file for you using something like: &lt;echo file='DemoFlags.java'&gt; public interface DemoFlags { static public boolean demo = ${demo.setting}; } &lt;/echo&gt; then you can invoke that with ant -Ddemo.setting=true Inside your code you then would use if( DemoFlags.demo ) { doThis(); } The second option would be to have two different classes providing the **main** method, one (DemoMain.java) that changes a global demo flag to **true** public class Main { static public boolean demo; static public void main(String args[]) { if( demo) { doThis(); } } } public class DemoMain { static public void main(String args[]) { Main.demo = true; Main.main(args); } } the other (ProductionMain.java) that changes the flag to **false** public class ProductionMain { static public void main(String args[]) { Main.demo = false; Main.main(args); } } Then if you were to create an executable jar file, you set the **Main-Class** setting in the demo jar manifest to the DemoMain, and set it in the production jar manifest to the ProductionMain. 
It sounds like you just need to replace recorders with: recorders.getRecorderList() 
I second this. JSF has so much conceptual potential, but then you use it and... well... "death pit" is being kind.
This is exactly how I abuse python. 
Please explain. I have been using JSF very successfully for several years. It has dramatically reduced complexity and development time for my application. I suspect you only have experience with an older version of JSF. Before version 2.0 it was not very good at all.
And I guess connection timeout should be different (longer?) than read timeout, so having one value to control both timeout is bad, thus the article suggests having two values to control connection and read timeout?
Shameful, the proposed solution is just so awful. 
I think I just had a light bulb moment, and it was the part about getting links to each item in the cart and not the cart itself. So if you wanted to change the quantity of an item in the cart, you PUT the changes to the cart/item url? What about the case where I want to display the cart to the user at the end of the process when they are ready to check out? Is that N+1 calls to get all the data?
&gt;This project is based on gridworld, but I cannot find anything online about this particular action. That's because there's no "included action" for this. You'll have to write it yourself. Think about it this way: You have a block of code that will only execute when the bug turns. How can you use this to your advantage to complete what you need to do? Since this is a class assignment I'm not going to answer it for you, and neither should anyone else. This is for your own good that you try to solve this. However, answer my first question with some effort and we'll move from there.
I tried using a switch with motionHandler, but that did not work.
You don't need a motion handler. Try again, identify *the block of code which is executed only when the bug turns*.
You're talking about something that is already there? Thanks for your help so far.
&gt; else { turn(); turn(); steps = 0; Could it be this block?
As you can tell, java is not my strong suit.
That's right! Nicely done. Now, does it make sense that anything within the `else` statement will only execute when the bug turns? Another way to put it would be, this block is what's responsible for turning the bug.
Now that I understand this, what syntax determines the direction, and furthermore, how to I define the color to be used?
For that, we refer to the Gridworld API (Application Programming Interface). Specifically, we want to know what [Actors](http://www.horstmann.com/gridworld/javadoc/) in GridWorld can do. There are two methods you need from this page to accomplish what you need to do. What are they?
getDirection() and setColor() is what it looks like
Again, correct. Read the documentation on `getDirection()` and `setColor()`, and really *understand* what they do and how they work. What do they return? How do you interpret the data? How do you call these methods?
do I need to call a getDirection method and then use an "if then" statement to set the color based on the number of the degrees returned?
That's one way to do it, yes. And for a beginner, it is perfectly okay to do. Give it a try and come back if you're stuck.
As you can see I am, in fact a beginner. I will check back in a minute as to if this works.
Yes.
* read the boolean value from a [property file](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/properties.html) * have two property files in your application as "templates", one for prod one for dev * use ant to copy the corresponding property file to the correct location where it is read at runtime
So I tried what you proposed, and it compiled, but the colors did not change. Surely there is some small error that I made? import info.gridworld.actor.Bug; import java.awt.Color; public class SpiralBug extends Bug { private int sideLength; private int steps; int direction; public SpiralBug(int n) { sideLength = n; steps = 0; } public void act() { if (steps &lt; sideLength &amp;&amp; canMove()) { move(); steps++; } else { turn(); turn(); steps = 0; sideLength++; if (direction == 0) setColor(Color.red); if (direction == 90) setColor(Color.green); if (direction == 180) setColor(Color.blue); if (direction == 270) setColor(Color.black); } } }
In your code, you reference a `direction` variable that's never defined.
You can't use variables without defining them first. Also, remember that method you found? One called `getDirection()`? Why aren't you using it?
Yes, yes, what should I define it as? import info.gridworld.actor.Bug; import java.awt.Color; public class SpiralBug extends Bug { private int sideLength; private int steps; int direction; public SpiralBug(int n) { sideLength = n; steps = 0; } public void act() { if (steps &lt; sideLength &amp;&amp; canMove()) { move(); steps++; } else { turn(); turn(); steps = 0; sideLength++; getDirection(); if (direction == 0) setColor(Color.red); else if (direction == 90) setColor(Color.green); else if (direction == 180) setColor(Color.blue); else if (direction == 270) setColor(Color.black); } } } 
You're so close. You just need to save the value returned by `getDirection()` in a variable. How about `direction`?
This whole thread is some excellent work. I have a tendency to call people out on homework questions but instead of just dismissing the OP you have taught them how to think like a programmer.
int direction = getDirection();
That's right! Great job. Now, does it work?
The colors do not change. I am using another class to call it if that helps. Should I post that class too?
Sure.
 import info.gridworld.actor.Actor; import info.gridworld.grid.UnboundedGrid; import info.gridworld.actor.ActorWorld; import info.gridworld.grid.Location; import java.awt.Color; public class SpiralBugRunner { public static void main(String[] args) { UnboundedGrid grid = new UnboundedGrid&lt;Actor&gt;(); ActorWorld world = new ActorWorld(grid); SpiralBug sp = new SpiralBug(3); sp.setColor(Color.red); world.add(new Location(3,5),sp); world.show(); } }
Can I see your SpiralBug again? The issue isn't in this other class.
 import info.gridworld.actor.Bug; import java.awt.Color; public class SpiralBug extends Bug { private int sideLength; private int steps; int direction = getDirection(); public SpiralBug(int n) { sideLength = n; steps = 0; } public void act() { if (steps &lt; sideLength &amp;&amp; canMove()) { move(); steps++; } else { turn(); turn(); steps = 0; sideLength++; if (direction == 0) setColor(Color.red); else if (direction == 90) setColor(Color.green); else if (direction == 180) setColor(Color.blue); else if (direction == 270) setColor(Color.black); } } } 
after the move() or turn() method, but I am leaning towards right after the move(); steps++; Edit: I see it goes before the If statement. It now works. Thank you SOOOO much for your help and guiding me through rather than just giving me the answer. You have tauhgt me more in a few hours than my teacher has all year. Would it be okay if I messaged you for help on future projects? I now feel that I have a better grasp of Java thanks to you. 
He has helped me immensely.
Great job! You've done it. Feel free to PM me anytime if you've got questions.
You can find all components in a container...with a function along the lines of public void findComponents(Component parent, List&lt;Component&gt; outComponents) { outComponents.add(parent); if (parent instanceof Container) { for (Component child : ((Container) parent).getComponents()) { findComponents(child, outComponents); } } }
I am more interested in looking at the actual visual layout and identifying components by name.
I think the read timeout should actually be longer, I'd rather wait a while for an answer from the server than wait a long time to connect to it. The server might even disconnect you if your connection timeout is too long, otherwise you can flood the server with connection attempts. HTTP persistent connections (So a connection that doesn't need to be reestablished after every request) will disconnect you after 5 minutes of inactivity. So I guess you could make your read timeout as long as 5 minutes. If the connection timeout was 5 minutes, I could spam start clients that connect to the server and crash it, but again the server probably has a timeout on its own for how long its allowed to take.
One of my pet peeves in building gui's is the number of artifacts (i.e. files) you need to display a screen. In Vaadin it's just one java class which is easily refactorable from IDE, that's pretty hard to beat. 
[Wiziq.com](http://www.wiziq.com/courses) is quite a good site with thousands of courses. Their course on [Learn Java online](http://www.wiziq.com/course/25894) has got very good response, as it covers all java platforms. The best part is that its live and instructor led and not recorded videos. They also have many other features. Try going there &amp; discover them yourself.
I think Java is the best language to start with..It's a basic for many languages going on these days &amp; also a mandate for many programming jobs.. It also helps you understand OOPs concept better. However if you have time, then start with C. As it will help you pick up Java better. After all Java was more like an improvement on C/C++.
I do not understand. If you are using JSF properly you have a Facelet/Html page and a Java class. It is just a simple MVC setup. I do not know what all the artifacts you were creating are.
Bad, but not totally awful. It was an answer based on the question that was asked. Tempact111 didn't provide the reason why he needed to do something like this so I provided an approach that matches the question. Now, from his response you can see it started him thinking about other alternatives such as having the main game class then subclassing to provide the entry point. I considered suggesting passing in a flag on the command line to indicate demo mode, but that then might have lead to the need for startup batch/shell scripts to properly invoke the application. It is not uncommon for a Java jar to have multiple classes with a **main** method where the manifest file defines the class to use under normal **java -jar myjar** but also allows the user to use **java -cp myjar org.myclasses.OtherMain** to startup. A game application might package all code, client, server, editor, etc., into one jar where the game is the standard startup, but the server or editor is an alternate.
Download the JAR file containing the Applet, and use a decompiler like JODE to look at the source.
Already have the source. I just want to identify the controls visually.
It's been a couple of years since I last used JSF 2 (It was one of the Primefaces big releases which made me take a look), but back then, I found it to be klunky - even if it worked. Don't get me wrong, there's worse things in the world (GWT, I'm lookin at you!), but JSF just seemed like it was "too much" for what it was doing. Hard to explain since my usage experience is not extensive.
Hmm ... I'm not sure I follow what you're trying to do, but way back when I used to do a lot of Swing, I would sometimes hard code border colors (RED, BLUE, GREEN) on the various JPanels and other Swing widgets so I could see exactly how the layout managers were placing them in the frame. Maybe your AWT widgets have a .setBackgroundColor(...) method or something like that? Might help. EDIT: Another idea would be to add an 'onMouseMove' listener to each widget and do a System.out.println("Mouse moving over widget X") statement to each widget. Then mouse around and watch the console output.
 public class OceanRecorder { List&lt;Recorder&gt; recorders; // Blah Blah public List&lt;Tsunami&gt; findAllAboveIntensity(double intensity) { List&lt;Tsunami&gt; results = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); for (Recorder recorder : recorders) { results.addAll(recorder.listTsuGThan(intensity)); } return results; } } &gt; i have been posting alot recently [alot](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_D_Z-D2tzi14/S8TRIo4br3I/AAAAAAAACv4/Zh7_GcMlRKo/s400/ALOT.png) 
Run it in Netbeans or JDeveloper using the visual debugger. You can freeze it when running and examine the UI structure with your mouse. Take a look here: https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/java/debug-visual.html
The classes are live..recordings of which are made available for download later
The important thing to take away is: could you have asked yourself the questions he asked you? That's really the key. When you get stuck, try to figure out what you might need to know. Sometimes saying it out loud can really help. (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging). Then try to figure out the answer. 
When are the mods gonna stop this guy?
Hello Poodle, what is the issue? 
If you really don't care about it being "hacked", then why not just set a property from the command line in your launcher scripit? IOW, in the launcher, set a property: java -DappFlags.runMode=demo -jar yourExeJar.jar and in code, read the property: boolean demo = "demo".equals(System.getProperty("appFlags.runMode")); If you wanted a smidge more "security", you could use one of the tools to create a binary launcher, rather than a batch file or shell script. That would at least "hide" the flag. Of course, in practice I would do something more like oldprogrammer's second suggestion, difference being that I would likely have two implementations of the main game class, and would have separate compile targets in my build.xml for demo and production modes, only compiling in the correct implementation.
Hey I remember bug world! (Got a 4 on the AP, beat my score, you can do it!)
Maybe the fact that out of dozens of your submissions 99% are comming from tech.pro site?
Thanks for the feedback Again. I try to stay away from popular HN, EchoJS, DZone posts because I figure that everyone will have already seen those. I'll vary up my submissions in the future. Thanks again. Poodle if you have any other input would love to hear it!
Amazing. And so kind of you to take time to teach in what, I'm reasonably sure, was your free time. I'm assuming you are some sort of computer wizard, but have you considered teaching? You have a gift. 
Tagging you as "socratic as fuck" *note to self: always ask for help with coursework by describing it as "just for fun"*
There's a fella sat in front of me on the train to birmingham with this page open and your comment is on screen, I think he's asleep but if not...hi :-)
Like this? http://i.imgur.com/6PueuvW.jpg
[it is forbidden to love Eclipse here](http://www.ihateeclipse.com/) (just kidding)
God damn, I didn't understand much of the technical stuff but that comment chain was amazing to read. 
haha hello sleepy man in birmingham
You did an awesome job. You helped him solve his problem instead of just giving him the answer - that's the hallmark of a good teacher, IMO. =)
Rubber ducking works wonders. I've asked my sister who has a high school knowledge of programming questions and it has helped me sooooooooooo many times.
Oddly enough that about where I am too
Oh god, Gridworld. I tried to forget - thanks for bringing back the nightmares, OP!
I read that whole exchange. You're a hero dude. This is the kind of shit that keeps me coming back to reddit and digging through the trash to find these gems.
This was great to read. I am a software engineer myself and love seeing people think out the problems, no matter how remedial or complicated they are. Just take it step by step, one line at a time, and you helped him out on each step without answering the question outright. Love it. Programming is so much about failing over and over again and trial by fire. Fail to learn why things work. 
Oh my god are you my internal voice when I program? I swear I go through all these steps basically as you described them to find solutions. Well, that and google. 
Believe it or not, I attend one of the premier schools in the state, and am at the top of my class. My friends and I have asked her to explain what methods mean or how the code works, but she denies responsibility and tells us to look online for help, citing that we are lazy when asking her questions. I want to understand the code, not have it given to me, but she seems against that altogether.
Maybe change server name to localhost? Also force the port number there, per: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms378428.aspx &gt;For optimal connection performance, you should set the portNumber when you connect to a named instance. This will avoid a round trip to the server to determine the port number. 
Not on the train, I live in a suburb
sounds like shes lazy and defensive about it. Good thing kindly folks like Kristler and resources like reddit exist!
/r/learnprogramming - I sub to this group to both answer and learn from my peers. Good group of folks over there.
She doesn't even make her own materials, they are copied from the internet.
Gotta love that logic. "Stop asking questions, you're being lazy.... here's the code."
Sadly, this is a highschool class. She is the only teacher of this subject. My friends and I mainly work together to try to figure it all out. Thats the only way we can get by.
Good guy Kristler 
Then it sounds like she might be out of her element. Try talking to a counselor about your concerns and see what you could get out of that. If you have exhausted your resources, and still have trouble getting everything you can out of her and the class, express your concerns to them.
It sucks now, but you're teaching yourself how to learn. In the long run that will pay off in a major way.
As a graduating senior this December, in Computer Science and Engineering, this takes me back to AP computer in high school. GridBagLayout!
Half of the students from the first day have already dropped the class.
Shouldn't be too hard, she talks down to us everyday, going so far as to call me stupid for not knowing which of two locations to turn in an assignment, I'm in 11th grade, but that doesn't mean I will take her abuse.
no, that's the firewall. that shouldn't matter if your ms sql server is running on localhost. (and installing ms sql server might have already added the firewall exception.) there should be a setting in ms sql server itself to allow TCP connections. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb909712(v=vs.90).aspx
I know. I enjoyed learning through this thread.

I disagree with this article. Glassfish is not going anywhere it is open source and the Java EE reference server. Oracle is ending commercial support contracts. I doubt many people were using this option in the first place.
People dropping from programming classes is a common occurrence. Lots of people don't like to solve hard problems, or do a lot of math based work. Keep with it. There will be times when you don't have ANY idea what you are doing, and will be times you don't turn in any working code at all. You have to fail in programming to understand what is going on. Don't let other peoples opinion on the course affect your own. If you don't like it and have tried it, that is completely different. People are shocked at the difference a computer science curriculum is, and how much different thinking is to do it. It is a great lesson to learn and gives you solid foundations in a lot of other areas. But seriously, if you are having problems learning the material the school says they provide classes for, and the one in charge of explaining that material can't or won't, you need to voice your concerns to the instructor and maybe a counselor depending on how far you get with the instructor. Keep asking questions. Lots and lots of questions.
I love the internet so much. That is all. 
No, there's a setting in SQL server itself. On that box, Start --&gt; Programs --&gt; SQL Server Configuration Manager --&gt; (in there somewhere obvious)
Sounds like it's time to give up on a teacher who doesn't want to teach. Luckily there are a ton of resources and communities on the internet for learning about programming. There's reddit, as you've obviously discovered. A few more are: http://www.dreamincode.net/ the people here are really adamant about helping you find the solution and not just giving you the code. http://stackoverflow.com/ If you've ever searched anything about programming on google, you've seen this place. http://thenewboston.org/ This guy has a ton of great tutorials, and explains things pretty nicely.
I cannot express how much help this subreddit has been to me.
Any chance the "hooverbuc" in your username is a reference to Hoover in Birmingham, AL? I go to Bama and I know a shit ton of Hoover kids. 
Like I said, it might be because she is in over her head and got stuck teaching the course. These things happen in High School. You went to reddit/r/java so that is a great tool to use to ask questions. there are a LOT of videos on youtube as well these days that can help you learn or re-learn some of the fundamentals. I remember I learned and got help on a bunch of calculus through youtube videos of people just doing problems and recording them. https://www.khanacademy.org has some learning programming fundamentals as well, and its free with videos. also, CodeAcademy has some resources too, but I had some trouble finding anything java related. edit: there is also this subreddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming
Now I'm really confused. I am Birmingham.
Her title is teacher.... thats about it.
We'll call it "The Kristler Response." Example usage: &gt; "Don't ask me to do your work. I'm just going to Kristler you." I'm thankful /u/I_RAPE_CATS didn't write this
ouch. Feel your pain man, had a degree level writing class which was reading out of a textbook for an entire year. No discussion, just read the chapter then do the exercises at the end. I didnt finish the course.
Yes, it is.
Have my babies, plesae.
Absolutely agree. I've learned two things from rubber ducking; first is that talking to my dog when I'm stuck on a programming issue is surprisingly effective. The second is that when a co-worker or friend comes to me with a problem that I don't know anything about, it's still worth it to say "sure, explain what's going on to me". I might not get a whole lot out of it, but they often do.
You're awesome! 
I had a teacher like yours once. It was in my Statistics class in college. She barely spoke English and we all had little study groups outside of class to basically teach ourselves. We visited her office many times and the first thing she would ALWAYS tell us was: "Did you even read the book? All of this is in the book." So, what resulted was that we understood the subject more in-depth because we studied everything, did all of the sample problems, not just the "required" chapters and problems. If you study Java and other programming languages out of your own interest, and not just as a requirement for school, you will get SOOO much more out of it. Best of luck, we've all been where you are, keep your chin up, study hard, screw the haters, and don't let any teacher be lazy about their job. Teachers exist to...teach. If you aren't learning properly, they aren't teaching - they're just collecting a paycheck.
&gt; People dropping from programming classes is a common occurrence. This makes me so sad. Programming is really a force for democracy - well, as long as the programmer has access to the hardware. When you can program competently, it feels like you have endless possibilities at your fingertips - a really powerful feeling. Now if only schools would put competent teachers in classes.
I run a study group at my workplace for java certifications. I may be able to help you if you need it as well. Feel free to PM me.
I always saw GlassFish as the reference implementation that is of no use in real world projects.
This is the perfect demonstration of the Socratic method of teaching. You have my respect and upvote. 
Had no idea 1 internet is worth a quarter. 
Very inspiring, well done.
Beautifully done my friend, so much more effective than taking the easy way of fixing his code for him. Loved every minute of that.
Good job.
He Miyagi'd me!
&gt; The final criteria was vendor support. That kicked WAS CE out of the game. As of yesterday it would also removed GlassFish. The two remaining alternatives burned down to one: Which is JBoss AS7 / WildFly. Indeed, and this would be bad news if the JEE servers legitimately offered businesses commensurate business value, but since that's been a thing of the past for many years now, the JEE server license business seems to be a thing for the Computer Associates' of the world.
Not sure if all apcs students do this but you aren't at CHS with gerb as your teacher, are you?
Are you an instructor? The way you handled all of this is the way is how all instructors should operate! When I have instructed classes, I always make folks make folks ask questions. If I'm doing a PC 101 class, I teach old ladies and gear heads how to tear their computers down and put them back together. Then I force then to question why things aren't working. Then you start to step up from there. Teach a man to fish etc
/r/gonewild alone is worth, like, 2 internets. 
I refuse to believe that this actually happened. There wasnt even one single missing semicolon! Seriously though, this is awesome to read through, even as someone who gave up on ever being able to code after three semesters because I was astonishingly terrible at it. I liked it, and I kept taking comp classes I didn't need because I liked it, but I always skirted by with a C and couldn't get about half of my programs to ever work. (This is, apparently, an acceptable answer to why your GPA sucks ass while interviewing. "Well sir, while everyone else was taking basketweaving 101 for their free A's, I was taking 200-300 level comp sci, english, and history courses that I didnt need. They interested me and I was trying to get the most out of college, it made sense at the time!") Now, architecture I feel like I could get into. I've always hated myself just a little bit for giving up before I took that class and not even bothering to audit it. 
Would you like to understand more of the technical stuff?
This is where you'll find your answer: http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/jdk/file/tip/src/share/classes/sun/net/NetworkClient.java I'd recommend that every Java developer download a reasonably new JDK source code set to their machine. Other links: http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/jdk/file/tip/src/share/classes/sun/net/www/http/HttpClient.java http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/jdk/file/tip/src/share/classes/sun/net/www/protocol/http/HttpURLConnection.java http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/jdk/file/tip/src/share/classes/java/net/URLConnection.java http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/jdk/file/tip/src/share/classes/sun/net/www/URLConnection.java
&gt; at CHS Chelsea? No 
My APCS teacher was very similar to yours, and I learned pretty much everything I know in college (graduating this December). However, you're definitely going to have a leg up on where I started, since I didn't make the effort you're making right now to learn the stuff in high school. Good job!
We need more programmers like you and less elitist jerks :) Kudos for helping him UNDERSTAND, and not just finish.
The SQL Server settings are the window on the left in his screencap. The firewall should be irrelevant, like you said, but the other window is the right place to change the TCP setting for SQL-Server.
That's what's in the screencap on the left.
Great job and patience on teaching a new coder rather than giving him the answer. 
I've been gainfully employed in software engineering since 1984 (now have my PhD and teach at college level too, but am learning teaching methods since I'm new at it), and I can tell you that the only good hires I've ever made were people who did stuff outside class on their own, for fun. Do it, and put that on your resume, OP.
This is one of /u/lukaseder alt accounts, he has at least a dozen or circle jerks with other blogspammers here to submit and upvote links in order to push their page rank. Nothing is too mundane for this guy to talk about or self promote. It's blogspam plain and simple. There is a X% of readers here that have the secondary effect he is looking for, exposure, page views and possibly link backs. There are a couple other people that spam /r/java but this guy is the one I recognize the most. 
Not sure if this helps but if you're trying to draw a spiral of Archimedes (r = theta) you could just calculate all the coordinates in a list and then convert to Cartesian coordinates. Then, make a method that moves the bug to any given coordinate and just apply that to the whole list. Good luck
It's very hard to find skilled teachers of programming at the high school level. It doesn't pay nearly as well as web design or other even entry-level programming jobs. College is much better.
You're mixing some problems here, Taylee, and propagate false information: **Setting the read and connection timeout** The answer is based on your expectations. If you want to write something into a database or some kind of storage, and want to be absolutely sure that it'll be stored then you select high timeout values. Simply because persisting the data has a higher priority than the time it might take. And since the storage system might be overloaded you prefer to wait long for it to be stored than to fail. If you perform a server-request in some kind of client, where a user is actively waiting, then you probably use low timeout values. Simply because some guy is waiting for the request to be done and usually people hate waiting (well, beside Hobbits). Sometimes it's better to fail fast, sometimes it better to wait than to fail because the network or the server is slow. Then again the question of "should read and connect timeout be the same?". IMHO it's based on experience with the remote system and the network. When I **know** that the server has a slow storage backend (or whatever it takes the information from that I want) or is simply slow at delivering the stuff I want, then I probably select a much higher read timeout than the connect timeout. But usually I'd set both timeouts to the same value, simply because I can. **HTTP persistent connections** AFAIK there's no standard on how long a persistent connection will stay alive. At least in an Apache it's [configurable](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/en/mod/core.html#keepalivetimeout). **Connection spamming** Why should a high connection timeout be a problem for the server? It just means the client might wait longer, so it's a problem on client-side but not on server-side. Also you're referring to malicious clients when we're simply talking about timeouts. A simply DoS attack is by opening as many sockets as possible and to slowly work on the sockets. That way the server won't close the socket but keep them open as he expects a slow client. The server is not able to accept any more sockets and is therefore unreachable. I don't want to insult you or anything. Maybe you just used the wrong terms. Just clearing it up for the GraphiteCube.
What are you trying to say? What are the Computer Associates' of the world? You do realize Java EE is extensively used on many large and critical systems right? If you seriously question this take a look at any job posting site and you will see it is very popular. EDIT: I assume you are referring to Java EE and JEE is a shortcut you made up to reference it. If not you may be responding to the wrong thing.
/u/Kristler *taught* me how to think about Java. I'm great at other subjects, and /u/Kristler taught me to think.
This intrigued me... England vs Alabama? Just asking.

Alabama
Well, I appreciated the post. Admittedly I'm fairly new to Eclipse, so this may well be old news to most people. At least this wasn't one of those sites that puts each tip on a different page.
The Servlet part of JEE, which Tomcat and Jetty implement, is extensively used in enterprises. However, the EJB legacy architecture, which the application server license business are built on, has been obsolete now for a few years. Since I'm not working for a JEE license sales company, I can use the common term, instead of having corporate insist I always remember to add the (R) symbol, and use the newest product names which sales are keen on having on everyone's lips. I remember having the same discussion online with Sun marketing people who objected "Sun Java System Application Server Platform Edition 9 Update 1 Patch 1" being referred to as "SJSAS" instead of using the full name in every instance. Fuckers.
Go Bucs?
I believe most people here are from the UK its about rush hour
This is exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!
Quite the opposite. Go Rebels! haha
I don't want to add any extra code. I think Keilly above got at what I was looking for. Thanks though.
What's worth 14 internets?
I would love to learn the technical stuff, I took an intro to Java and to Python. Python was pretty basic. Java was a bit more technical but I have unfortunately forgotten most of what I learned. I loved programming, it was like solving little puzzles, and I felt that I was good ad it. But I didn't peruse it, and now its all but gone. The last couple weeks I've been contemplating picking it back up. Seeing as I am no longer in school I wondering what good resources are out there? Thanks! 
Apparently I didnt. Haha. 
Great teacher!! Wish we had more like you
I'd give CodeAcademy.com a try. I haven't used it (I'm alreadly a programmer) but my wife taught herself python using it. However I would suggest in addition running the examples on codeacademy.com, you also download a free compiler/interpreter for whatever language you choose to pick up. You can then play a little outside of the assignments, and sometimes there is a bug in codeacademy's tutorial and it is always good to have a second opinion.
Wrong state, oh well. I had a similar programming teacher like that in High School. She'd get mad if we wrote more efficient code, even if it only used what she had taught us. She WANTED it to crap, I think.
You might need a port for the server. Here's how a recent project, of mine, looks: Connection connection = null; try { Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"); connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://" + DBConstants.DBIP + ":"+ DBConstants.DBPORT + "/"+ DBConstants.DBNAME,DBConstants.DBUSER, DBConstants.DBPASS); } catch (SQLException e) { System.out.println("Connection Failed! Check output in console"); e.printStackTrace(); return null; }catch (ClassNotFoundException e) { throw new RuntimeException("Cannot find the driver in the classpath!", e); }
you are awesome. kudos
Sorry but intentionally using an incorrect term is just confusing to people and reduces your credibility. There is no such thing as a JEE sales company. It sounds like you had a bad experience with some vendor but that really has nothing to do with Java EE itself. I hope you are aware there are multiple free production ready Java EE servers so there is no need to pay for one (JBOSS, Geronimo, Tomcat with OpenEJB or TomEE, Glassfish). EJB is far from a legacy architecture by the way. I am not currently using it myself but it is widely used. There was a period where it started to fall out of favor but it was greatly improved and rebounded nicely. There are many parts to Java EE outside of EJB. way. Java Server Faces (JSF), Dependency Injection (CDI), Java Messageing Service (JMS) are a few but there is much more. If you want to learn more check out the official tutorials at http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/doc/home.htm.
More gold for you, and seriously well-deserved. All it takes sometimes is a person willing to be patient and help someone learn how to find the answer to turn on a lightbulb in their mind. Thanks for selflessly helping someone who was willing to listen!
but I don't see anything about TCP/IP options in those settings. It's buried in there I'm sure, but it's not in the screen cap. If you don't enable TCP/IP, you can still connect locally with the ms sql server command line tool through IPC on localhost. The connection specifics will stay the same, but the tool will try different options behind the scenes. (I am mostly guessing, but I'm pretty sure that's how it works.)
My god, if my programming teachers could teach half as well as this, classes would be much easier.
Don't feel bad man, I think Java is a lot more forgiving with semi-colons than C++ is. I can't count how many fucking assignments I got stuck on for an hour in the computer lab with like 3 other people beside me because of syntax errors. It doesn't matter how well you understand the syntax, you type enough lines and you'll trip up, especially while learning.
I am definitely NOT /u/lukaseder. I do follow him on Twitter/JOOQ blog etc. I will, however not post any of his stuff here on /r/java if that would be better. Thanks though for your well worded comment though for that I will give you an upvote. Edit: Spelling.
We must be looking at different screenshots, because the windows on the left very clearly have TCP options listed. As a matter of fact, the window in the background on the left is exactly the window you will get to by following the instructions you provided.
Incorrect term? That's the common term used for JEE. Before that it was J2EE, which the marketing departments at license sales companies also didn't like, and wanted to replace with "Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition". Oh, those wacky marketing people and their comical belief that rebranding will solve their obsolecense problem. TomEE isn't a realistic alternative, and WildFly will be developed just as long as the application server license sales business have a few big legacy customers, who haven't yet audited their IT spending for wastage. Once the funding dries up, there aren't any user organizations holding the JEE facade up, since its development is entirely product sales driven. With no real money coming in, further development in the EJB legacy space will simply dry up, and the products will be left to rot, which is the Computer Associates business model.
sorry, i thought you meant the original screenshot. I only saw the firewall in the second screenshot (the first tiome around). that would seem to do it. try to restart the service? telnet to the port? this is all on localhost, right? cause if the java code is not on localhost then the service won't pick up the connection request - need to set the bind address to `0.0.0.0`.
I did APCS 4 years ago and had this same exact assignment. Oh the memories
&gt; If you aren't learning properly, they aren't teaching. &gt; If your students aren't learning, you aren't teaching. When I become a teacher, I will post this on my bathroom mirror and in the staffroom.
***java is not javascript is not java*** /r/javascript 
Well part of the proble with being a teacher is that you have 20-30 students in one class alone. This particular situation is a one on one situation and is much easier to teach. When you only have one student it is easier to teach THEM. When you're trying to teach 30 people, and they are all doing something different wrong and some of them totally understand what you're explaining to one person, while others are baffled by the words you are saying... It's a rough life for a teacher.
Don't worry, gridworld is just horrible. I took AP CS last year, so if you need any help, let me know (although, it seems like /u/Kristler has it covered)!
He helped him discover it himself... How else is he supposed to figure it out? Getting the entire code? Nope. Getting no help? That wasn't working out for him because he was doing something no one on the internet had talked about before.
Do it and post it on /r/pettyrevenge!
Agreed... good luck giving this kind of personal attention to 30 kids at a time.
Dude yes! The Purple Onion is just a short walk from the Sterne Library, where I'm typing this from. Love their falafels and shroom burgers.
Yes, but even in a similar situation my teacher said "google it". I understand the implications of a class and students, it's just absurd some of the responses I got over the years.
My teacher gives us a print out and tells us to copy it...
Don't modern IDEs catch these and tell you exactly the line where the issue is?
If he knew the basics he could easily solve this. He could have started with the basics by himself.
That you sir for your input. I realized that I have a long way to go to get this working it seems. I will have to look up jquery and see how to implement that as I have never heard of it. The &lt;div&gt; is a smart idea and I should have thought of that to begin with. Maybe it would be better if I start from scratch using jquery instead of trying to rebuild what I have already? 
We were using vi and g++, lol. It told me which function it was in, and beyond that it was up to me. 
he's probably not so sure
I got lectured through a java script "microwave" package last night for two hours... haha. I feel you.
I guess it's similar to my current project's problem where occasionally database connections aren't closing properly, and then I get exceptions thrown for trying to open an already-opened connection. And the "already open" exception is thrown on different functions every time the code runs/page loads. In that case, it's not an issue with syntax, just error handling and order of operations that needs to be straightened up.
I don't think that's petty. It's just.
Yeah...I wouldn't do that if I were you. Making an audio recording without the speaker's consent is kind of dick-ish. It's also illegal in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Washington. The dean won't be pleased about the teacher, but the odds are he won't be pleased with you either. Plus, the teacher ~~could~~ will sue you if she gets fired. 
Journey not the destination.
Is she the only teacher for programming classes (or one of the very few)? If so, the reason why she doesn't answer your questions is because she probably doesn't know the answers. In my city we have at least 5+ high schools, and my high school had over 2000 students and we were the only school that had programming classes. It was taught by only one person and he didn't know very much at all. He had a bunch of books and basically just gave us a book and told us to work through it. That glosses over how bad his classes were but I noticed most of the time when I asked him questions he only knew the basics and on side-programs I was working on that I would try to accomplish new and different things he didn't have a clue. Your teacher still sounds like a horrible teacher but its probably because she doesn't know what shes doing and is masking for that by being an asshole. Careful on that, if shes the only teacher for the class the school might defend her more strongly or they might remove the class altogether. Basically they just take someone who knows the minimum about this stuff that they can find to teach it, it probably looks good for the high school to have programming classes even if they don't really have someone knowledgeable enough to be teaching it.
Where are you finding the term JEE? I am not sure if we are even talking about the same thing. Java EE is the correct term used by Oracle to describe the Enterprise Edition of Java. The topic of this post is about a Java EE server. I feel like you are trying to intentionally spread misinformation. I can assure you that TomEE is a great alternative as are JBoss and Glassfish. All of them are being used in production all over the world. TomEE is new but it is only a packaging of Tomcat and OpenEJB which has been around and used a long time. You seem very focused on EJB as opposed to all of the other things offered by Java EE. EJB is only one of many parts of Java EE. It seems like you had a bad experience with some company named Computer Associates. Sorry about that but I do not think it is relevant to this topic.
Better than me, "teach a man a fish."
This is one-on-one tutoring. The dynamic is completely different from that of a classroom. This is why a small student to teacher ratio is desirable, so the student can get more direct attention and help if they need it.
As someone with some experience in tutoring, I must say, you truly have a great handle on how to help someone learn. I too use this strategy of "facilitated understanding" instead of just giving away answers, but I'm mostly impressed by your ability to make your probing questions both direct in what you want as an answer and helpful in facilitating the student into thinking about the next step. Well done.
Stop beating my school at football! :/ 
Producing the psuedo-code is a very similar step to producing the java, what's lacking here is problem solving. You have to think about what you are doing abstractly, for example the mental process that takes place when he is trying to test the direction. He declares a variable and then tests that variable without assigning anything to it. He needs to be able to think about what his purpose is there and be able to see that he wants direction to be meaningful. As he put it, direction was there without meaning and unfortunately Kristler told him that straight away focusing on an imprecise matter of fact "rule" about programming rather than helping him think critically and concluding on his own that direction was not being set.
Good luck!
Yeah, my comment was intended to contrast it with high school, because I learned almost nothing in high school and was worried about college
Hahahaha, did they at least tell you how to actually do what they were portraying? 
GridWorld is indeed not that fun to use. I hope they change the case study soon.
Who is Jesus and why did you call him?
Birmingham is no longer a virgin.
The meteor framework makes updating a view not just trivial, but automatic! [Live page updates](http://www.meteor.com/). I've really enjoyed using it.
To the OP: InfoSec is correct, at the least this is one of your problems, TCP is probably also a problem as well
If students would come to office hours, I would.
Holy shit you're patient. I might have said something snarky at this point. Nicely done.
If I had had a programming teacher at all.
FWIW my class has me using Eclipse to use Java btw. Torrent a Starting out with Java ebook from some site and just get started from chapter 1. It's literally what my college does. Straight down the line, almost no guidance, do these problems and turn them in.
You can't teach hapless techno weenies to type "cookie", you have to be elite! Cancer, Brain, Brain, Cancer, somebody talk to me!!! [Reference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_\(film\)) to the greatest film ever.
Lol fuck her. Doing java through an online course at colege atm and in the middle of methods too. I can do the work and figure out how to use but fuck me if you asked me what the hell a method/class is. I'd mumble some shit about reference variables and objects and hope that was enough.
For writing...? Wow, I could imagine technical aspects but something based around creativity.... That's just fucked up.
Find? It's what's used in discussions in and amongst user organizations. TomEE as a project is lucky it has so few users, given how few resources they have to fix bugs, as evidenced from their JIRA and version control. To describe it as a relevant alternative to an user organization which treats bugs in software as a statistical reality which needs credible controls in place, is leaving something quite important out of the picture. I used CA as the canonical example every senior person in the business should already know about. Their model is to buy products with weak but stable billing, and live on that edge. Those products have a weird semblance of life, but no real development, like a wax museum. They have been doing this for decades.
She is the only teacher, in a school of 3000+
If only my high school computer science teacher had been a fraction as good as you...
Wow, I never knew about most of these. #5 being probably the most useful. 
Yeah that is what I suspected, pretty much everything you said about that situation reminded me of what it was like in my classes except my teacher wasn't mean. Once you get into that further, if you find you the classes aren't as engaging at some point, you should just try coming up with your own projects to work on. Anything relatively small that seems interesting which gives you a reason to look up things you don't know how to do.
I've been using eclipse for a while and I just keep finding more and more neat functions, I'll share some basics that have made my life easier :) 1. Ctrl+space in general will try to complete a statement or give you a list of options. 2. Typing syso then pressing ctrl+space will make a "System.out.println" 3. Auto formatting code can be done through project-&gt;properties-&gt;java code style-&gt;formatter then project-&gt;properties-&gt;java editor-&gt;save actions and format the code on save. Really useful but shouldn't be used as a way to get proper formatting (Since it's something that's necessary to know if you want to work with programming) but as a way to do it quickly :)
This marks the first time I've ever given gold. As a programmer who is only any good at what he does because I had a mentor like you, I just wanted to say thanks for helping people out.
Thank you for the gold! I'm really glad /u/hooverbuc11 was so responsive and open to learning, it's really refreshing compared to some of the other people I help sometimes.
All I can tell you is the term you are using is not used by those who create and maintain the technology.
Are you saying he's wrong because he's not using the approved terminology?
that would be one on one teaching. AKA an apprenticeship. And that sort of thing is what you get as a result of 4-8 years of grueling studies at a university to prove you can learn in the first place.
I know that university shifts a lot of the responsibility to teach/learn anything over to the students, but I think my tutors still have a hard time getting the contents of their subject across. Try teaching basic software development and java to a lecture hall of 560 students. Kind of ridiculous.
She was a programmer before working here. She is qualified, she's just unwilling.
Yes
I just want to add, I don't mean to imply you shouldn't say something to the principal or whoever, just that you should know that there might be some politics behind it all. Your teacher is definitely not teacher material and whether or not the classes still exist isn't really a concern. Just do whichever you think is right for you to do. I think you showed everyone who just read all these comments you aren't stupid.
Does web development just mean JavaScript/HTML/CSS? No OO languages? [Oracle](http://education.oracle.com/) has instructor lead training which some people really like but instructor led training costs a lot more than self-study (which they also have). But I have a feeling that they might not have course that covers everything you want. When you say desktop and mobile do you mean thick GUI? Android applications programmed in Java and Swing or JavaFX applications on the desktop? Or do you want to use Java to create web-based applications with desktop and mobile friendly web UIs? You might have some trouble finding anything more than a book to cover desktop Java GUI applications although there are some JavaFX tutorials to get you started. For Android mobile apps, you need to be aware that it isn't really Java, Google borrowed the language (version 6) and some of the libraries but not all and added completely different stuff for all the UI and phone hardware. Things are a little different than with JavaScript. Java the language isn't that huge but once you add in the size of the all libraries and patterns it becomes huge. I was a professional Java teacher for many years and I can teach for a couple months without repeating a class. First you need to focus on learning the core Java SE stuff. Then you can pick the first UI/platform technology you want to go down. I'd suggest looking at the OCJA and OCJP Java certifications. Even if you don't want to take the certs the list of topics is a really good list of core Java SE topics that you should know before you branch off into GUIs. I will second the Big Nerd Ranch Android book but only after you've reached the OCJP level. Becareful because many Android courses and books assume you are already a Java programmer and only teach you what is different.
First comment I've ever gilded. Good work.
Well, there's definitely a divide between those who think I'm totally clueless and those like you.
I've never thought Java was a particularly good first language, ever since I did it for my first-year programming courses. It requires a lot of concepts just to write Hello World from scratch (if you're not just parroting the class and method definitions without understanding them): public class HelloWorld { public static void main(String[] args){ System.out.println("Hello world"); } } To write this without being told exactly what to write, you need to understand the concepts represented by pretty much every keyword: - `public` (access control) - `class` (object-oriented programming) - `static` (static vs. instance methods) - `void` (types) - `String` (String types specifically) - `String[]` (Array types of other types) - `args` (Variables) - `System.out` (modules) - `println` and string literals (the only thing we really care about!) Then, you have to compile the code (`javac`) so that you can run it (`java`). To say nothing of Eclipse! Now compare that to the python equivalent: print("Hello World") `python hello.py` 
I understand that, I was describing the point of view of those who's money you're after. EDIT: You referred to inside knowledge of discussions between "those who create and maintain the technology". Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that you're affiliated with them, and one way or another, stand to profit from cash flow into JEE/EJB development. Not an unreasonable assumption, given your statement, I think. EDIT2: below, /r/avoidhugeships describes that he stated &gt; All I can tell you is the term you are using is not used by those who create and maintain the technology. based on Googling (sorry, "[searching with Google.com (TM)](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-you-google.html)") oracle.com, which rather changes the amount of credence and interpretation I would have otherwise given to the statement.
Oh god, I hate Eclipse so much. What a stupid piece of shitty software. The funny thing is this guy is talking about block select like he heard it for the first time in his life. Please use easily without breaking your fingers by holding Alt and left clicking to select. In IntelliJ IDEA of course, why would you use anything else.
Apparently your positive view of Open Source is frowned upon(votes)... with no explanation why... ?? edit: not no errors no more...
Many Virgins pass through Birmingham each day. I myself have been on several of them.
Yes! He is using a term that is popular with his group but not widely used. That is confusing on a forum. I thought it was just misunderstanding but I can see from his last comment he may just be trolling.
What? Whose money is it you think I am after? You keep talking about a company I have not heard of and expensive Java EE servers. I am trying to tell you do not need to buy them because there are many good free alternatives. I think this is meant as an insult to me but I do not get it.
You'd do well to also refer to http://www.unl.csi.cuny.edu/faqs/sock-faq/html/unix-socket-faq-4.html#ss4.6 and especially read up about SO_LINGER and SO_KEEPALIVE. Then grep (I recommend ack-grep) for ``SO_LINGER`` and ``SO_KEEPALIVE`` in the JDK sources. EDIT: also, http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/socket.7.html
You referred to inside knowledge of discussions between "those who create and maintain the technology". Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that you're affiliated with them, and one way or another, stand to profit from cash flow into JEE/EJB development. Not an unreasonable assumption, given your statement, I think. EDIT: &gt; I am trying to tell you do not need to buy them because there are many good free alternatives. I just described to you how those free alternatives are both not realistically useable, and are furthermore directly dependent of the same license sales business, since the free projects themselves do not fund the spec development, but externalize the spec development costs to the license sales companies. As the cash flow from license sales has waned over the years, new development has concentrated in taking the innovations from other de facto standard projects, rebranding them, and marketing this as progress. Since marketing costs quite a bit, this has drained even more budget out of actual development. You can see now how unsustainable this is, can't you?
We all know what he means when he says JEE but that doesn't make it an officially recognized term. See https://java.net/projects/javaee-spec/pages/JEE from the Java EE spec authors.
This definitely sounds like a homework problem. Pay attention in class maybe?
Ugh, that is just ridiculous. Can you talk to the head of the department about this? The way she's "teaching" obviously doesn't help anyone to *learn* anything. 
It could use an update, nothing worse really. The AP CS exam needs an update overall...
Yes, here are easy starting points for the three leading alternatives: * http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/ * http://www.playframework.com/ * http://grails.org/
Oh my lanta...I have no clue what's going on here guys...
Any book in particular you would recommend?
Thanks for the heads up!
On the other hand, if the question is so trivial that you can google it.. This is why there are people who will post lmgtfy instead of actually going to the answer. To be a respectable programmer.. nay, to be a respectable adult, being able to do independent research is a key skill to have. Students nowadays have easy access to Google and large databases of information and still somehow can't seem to be bothered to figure out things on their own. Imagine what life used to be like when they'd have to go to the libraries to look up words..? (Of course, I never tell my students to just Google it. I'm just saying that I could understand the temptation.)
Thats the key to programming, in all honesty. You _NEED_ patience, because there will be stuff that'll make you want to throw your computer out of an airplane over a volcano with you attached to it. The hardest part of programming is where /u/hooverbuc11 is right now. It's where most people give up if they're not dead serious about learning the skill. It's where you kind of understand a little bit of whats going on, enough to pick at things and do minor things, but you don't yet have the knowledge to understand the complete picture..entire aspects are not there yet, and its okay. Problem is how frustrating it can be to do something that you know a programmer could do in half a minute with his eyes closed...except for you, its day 2 and you still dont know WTF you did wrong. The good news is it gets a helluva lot better, its just this "hell gap" where the knowledge is there, but just not refined enough. I don't know how to explain it, but I know all programmers went through it. Once you cross this threshold, and you understand more of the fundamentals, rudimentary bug fixing and start to understand how the language flows you can fix and find things a lot easier. EDIT- Wrong name, meant /u/hooverbuc11 not /u/Kristler
What I saw was someone who didn't know what to do for this specific problem but was willing to learn when someone presented them with the right questions to figure out how to solve it. Even if you were clueless, with the mindset that you can learn you wouldn't be clueless for long.
I firmly believe anyone can learn how to program! I wrote a nice paragraph about how to start if you'd like to see it.
The last two programming classes had us using Tony Gaddis programming books. I can vouch for its efficacy but I'm maintaining an A in this Compsci I course.
Nope, still a first first university student, with a really big passion for teaching!
I haven't used it myself, but I know Spring is a powerful, enterprise scale, web framework that is widely used. If you're not locked into Java however, I would suggest taking a look at Django for Python, which is very simple and something I love using.
It is not inside knowledge it is on Oracle.com. Oracle is the steward of Java and Java EE. Any Java developer should know that and also the proper term for Java EE. It is in every text book, tutorial and class on the subject.
Thank you! I enjoyed it too!
Yup, I know some of those words 
It is indeed a trench of hell. The worst part of those days was the fact sometime you never knew if it was because it was coded incorrectly (logic wise) or there was something deeper, language related, that you didn't know was wrong. Are the methods used the ones that will actually perform the needed task? Are the tasks that you specified sufficient to complete the problem. Oh boy were those days fun. But, those that finish through the struggle get their deserved pay. Which is the part no one understands. Paying for good devs saves SOOOOO much time and money. Edit: Syntax error: line 3.
A shame you weren't in them
England for me
Marylebone...
Nice, Play looks like what I should do. Thank you. 
I'm sorry, but that's a terrible way to look at teaching. If a teacher can't coherently teach something, they shouldn't be teachers. That's like saying I had the right intentions of passing a class with a shitty teacher, but I failed! At least I tried, right?
Yeah, the metaphor I try and use is like riding a bike. You'll spend hours learning, you'll take off your training wheels only to crash dozens of times. Then one day you'll wake up, you'll get on the bike..and today it clicks and you'll be riding. It just takes persistence. Of course, naturally, you'll want to do a wheelie and tricks eventually, which puts you back towards square one, but with the fundamentals.
Very impressive to watch you teach step by step like that so effectively. You have the gift, son. Keep using it!
This isn't a "Teacher" situation, it's a "Tutor" situation
Yeah, its like the programmers crucible. Part of it is not knowing how freaking complicated the simplest things are when you first start...take for instance a button. As a normal person, a button is just that. It has some text, maybe its a picture, you click it and it moves in, and it goes and does whatever. As a programmer, you're worried about scaling the buttons properly, what happens when its clicked (Which can open up a whole other can of worms if your application is complicated), what should the button look like when its clicked, how and when do we revert back to the original state of the button, what happens if something goes horribly wrong, etc. Then if your a newb at the skill, you're probably thinking "No problem! I'll just throw all of that here, and it'll be good to go". Then you find yourself copy pasting code that you never should be, and a class thats 500 lines longer then it should be. Because of freaking buttons. I do not long for the days of old when I was first learning, I tell you that much =p
i failed my intro programming course with a 36, where passing was a 38. I am now a mechanical design engineer, working with solidworks, and i love it.
That was outstanding. Not often I look at a post gilded _eleven times over_ and think "yep, sounds about right."
I have a programmer friend and he calls it Problem Solving, but I think programmer vision sounds much cooler.
&gt; As the cash flow from license sales has waned over the years, new development has concentrated in taking the innovations from other de facto standard projects, rebranding them, and marketing this as progress. Progression for the Java EE Platform yes, for the Java industry no. Java EE is about standardization and not trailblazing. The ground-breaking work is done outside of the standards. But typically the guys that did the ground-breaking work come help write the standards at http://jcp.org. While I see the reasoning in some of your thoughts you're being a bit of a troll. Can you just call us a bunch of JEE whores and be done with it already? 
The idea was to "grind" some "Vanilla" java to remember syntaxes and such, I think I'm going with Play. (since it does both Scala and Java, I have heard of Scala so I'm assuming its a good thing to learn next. ) 
What would the advantages be ? 
I did once, I was stranded in the station for three hours. 0/10 would not get stuck during heavy snow
I live in Coventry and not one of you fuckers stopped to say hi.
Theres Google Web Tools. Which is pretty activiely developed.
Response to EDIT: I use those free products along with thousand of web applications around the world. You seem to think that one of the most widely used web frameworks in the world will fail in the near future. It is possible but I would not bet on it.
He understands the matrix...
Take a look at PrimeFaces web framework. It is an implementation of Java Server Faces. It is easy to learn and work with. Their demo page shows the source code for all the web components. http://www.primefaces.org/showcase/ui/home.jsf 
The first snarky programmer I've ever met!! &lt;/snarky&gt;
Yes, better even but you'll probably have to learn more before it becomes elegant. Once you learn Java you'll look back at how you coded in PHP and cringe. Start with just the standard Servlets,JSP,JSTL, and EL and learn good MVC design. Once you're done with that you can look into JSF, GWT, Struts, and Spring.
I dunno about you but I enjoyed it, I wrote Frogger in gridworld, another friend of mine made Civilization!
If your teacher was any good he wouldnt be teaching... thats my problem is I cant make 150 an hour teaching people to code...
Going from PHP to Java can give you quite a few snags, but is WELL worth the learning curve. I see that you've used a framework in PHP, so you're already past the whole "mixing your business logic in with your view" stage. Many PHP folks have what amounts to a huge HTML doc with lots of PHP snippets scattered around. This is barely even possible with Java. You CAN use JSP to do some of that, but it's such a horrible practice that we won't even go there. Spring has been mentioned here and it truly is the big one these days. I actually like using Play2 with Scala and Java. It's got a bit of "Railsy-ness" to it (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) so if you've ever played with that, you'll catch on quickly.
nice guy
Rude much? You realize there's a lot of good tutorials out there you can't find with a google search easily, considering java tutorial has about 55,000,000 results, which includes mostly bullshit. You're a dick.
Agreed. I guess its just more the exercises and assignments most AP courses assign, they don't use GridWorld to its full potential. Especially when they don't teach how to read an API, or how to construct a class from scratch. In fact, one of my biggest concerns with most intro programming courses is how much pre-made assignments are. When I took AP Comp Sci, I didn't get a single assignment where I had to write everything without any provided code.
I also have a huge passion for teaching. Getting my physics degree and soon masters in teaching. I've always wanted to know some real coding so perhaps I could have extracurricular classes for students who want to know how to code. Would you be willing to get in touch through skype or something similar and show me some pointers?
If I was still in school I would be pumped to have a study buddy such as yourself! Keep on kicken ass and asking questions!
Being a programmer *in no way whatsoever* means you are qualified to *teach* programming. They are almost entirely different skills which happen to overlap slightly.
Someone get this kid a rubber duck 
Listen, I'm making sound business arguments. I'd love to hear why they are wrong, or perhaps if there is a quantifiable, non-handwavy bigger picture? Educating people of the business realities could essentially be considered trolling people who are trying to use people's ignorance of those realities for marketing purposes. While that's not an interpretation I'd subscribe to, would that be wrong?
I've been learning from [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Sams-Teach-Yourself-Covering-Android-ebook/dp/B008XL1QUG/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1383863777&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=java+in+21+days), for Java. I really prefer to have a physical book rather than a webpage. It's been good so far. It starts out focussing on Object Oriented programming concepts, and then dives into the programming end of things. I write and use python regularly, but my approach has been heavily procedurally based (I'm a sysadmin so I'm usually writing a script to do one specific thing). The book has been strongly encouraging me to think about programming in a different way :)
I was there a while back to help record a band, Thoria. We made fun of each other's accents. I should have said hi.
This entire thread is just amazing. 
This was fascistic! I am by no means a programmer, nor do I understand anything that was said in this thread, but I wanted to read it all anyway because of the patience you showed. You are quite an exemplary individual!
Not denying you have a poor teacher, but I think that one warrants a little explanation. I took this same class a few years ago, and did this same assignment. Gridworld - and all that bug mess - comes from CollegeBoard. All of the code and the assignments are given by the people who make the AP test, and it will be referenced on the AP test. "Not making her own materials," for this particular assignment, is exactly how the class is supposed to be taught.
Me too :) Have no idea what they were talking about but it was great to see someone helping someone else out.
Outstanding job! I don't think I've ever seen a more gilded comment. Gold x11 as of now.
I took an Intro to Visual Basic course in college and that's what it mostly was, "writing the code" to get the desired outcome, but it walked you through the whole thing, and then at the end of the project had exactly what you needed. There were some projects that had to create your own stuff, but you could just copy and paste the code you needed from the class work and change the words and functions.
&gt; From there, the best way I've found to learn is to think of something you want to make, and then make it. Just start googling what you want to do. That's exactly how I'm working on my *auto hotkey skills*. I use the hotkeys as keybinds for a multi player game (GTA SA) and am learning by doing new stuff all the time. There are so many different things to discover.
Great work, Kristler. Acts like this give the community something to be proud of. 
 wow such comment many inbox wow so message 
&gt;M:That is not what I want. I want to understand the code, that is all i ask of you. &gt;T: Proceeds to post entire code to class webpage &gt;T: Learn from that, I'm going to eat. In the real world, there isn't always someone available that understands the code well enough to explain it, so it wasn't necessarily a jerk move for her to be unhelpful. If you read the docs and poke at the code long enough, you should be able to figure it out. 
Something tells me the answer they're supposed to be coming up with will be much lower level than Antlr (even if, I must say, I'm a real fan of it)

or they're licensing it under a different license (which seems more likely), ie they're using an old version or paid for it. 
Oh sweet, where'd you record? And you could have said hi if you knew what I looked like and were able to find me within a university of 24,000 students. Although with enough digging through reddit and other websites it would be incredibly easy to track me down. EDIT: removed a zero
no, it's a rounding error, as recognised by mathematicians and hardware engineers
I spent a lot of time working with kids with learning disabilities in High school. I guess it taught me a few thing about patience!
Not sure if you're a teacher IRL, but you definitely could be! Great job! 
...but let's be real here, she's probably tenured.
Aw shucks, you're too kind!
Yeah. It's unfortunate that sort of thing passes as "teaching".
God you are incredibly lucky! I graduated HS in 2002, we still had windows 3.1 computers that weren't connected to the internet. The computer teacher (whatever that means) was a 95 year old woman who could barely see. We spent 2 entire years "learning" microsoft word. 
I've got a year and 6 months of reddit gold, I'm drowning in gold!
Thank you! It's never too late to learn how to program, I wrote a paragraph for someone else if you'd like to see?
Sorry, I forgot to include my questions. I am asking 1. Is the code I have written so far the correct way to go about creating the first class? And 2. How do I even go about creating a second class? I am totally lost on the second part of the assignment basically and really can't even move on if the first part is messed up anyways. 
The not making her own materials is understandable for this, but every single assignment with no explanation. That's unacceptable.
This is not the real world, I am trying to learn this language. If I am not taught the basics, how can I ever hope to achieve better things on my own. I will go out of my way to learn, but first I must understand.
&gt; I have written some code for the first section (have not compiled it though) I am totally lost at the second section (#2). Well, the second section depends on the first section being completed, so let's look at that, first. The instructions specify that you need setters and getters for the three attribues (name, midterm, and final). Based on your current code, I see that you have some getters, but aside from "getName()" they don't appear to be, well, *getting* anything. Further, if you were to call "getName()", what would you expect it to return? Is a newline character part of the name? However, before you can get anything, you have to set it, so maybe start with that, and then move on to the getters.
I've figured it out thanks to my awesome instructors it was a lack of parentheses and a single missing line
Ahh yes, this is good stuff. It's gonna take me a while to digest all of this but I do appreciate the help. I might or might not stalk you now. Just sayin.
I wrote a paragraph for how to get started if you'd like to see?
Thirteen golds on one comment. That's gotta be some kind of record.

Thank you very much! I'm honoured someone with formal training appreciates what I've done.
Thank you very much! I'll try my best!
I used two have two different teachers for programming in college. One was one of the smartest people I've ever come across in terms of programming. The other... as nice as she was, she didn't know a thing about programming, she mainly focused on database designs. Anyway, both of these teachers would write out lines and lines of code and never explain it. I found the best way of doing it is repetitiveness. They usually gave us a task in class, a worksheet, something along those lines. Anyway, that worksheet gave an overview of what the code would do, and then the code that would allow you to do it. I learned how to program by not ever looking at that code on the worksheet until hours and hours had passed and I realised it was because I didn't know some of the syntax, and I was just guessing at it. But honestly, if you stick at it for long enough, things just sink in. But the point where I really started learning was when I made a game. I followed youtube tutorials to make it twice to get the concepts down, then on the third attempt I did everything from memory. Anyway, I guess I'm just trying to say if you keep practicing, you'll begin to understand it in one way or another! 
I think it is really awesome you being all educational n stuff by the way, I know it is difficult, at least for me, to explain things well, and you took the time to do so. 
This is a good lesson for you. Many of the teachers in computer related classes may be completely incompetent. You can't rely on them. So what can you do? Teach yourself to learn independently. Lose the weakness of needing to have someone show you anything that you can find out for yourself. Now this is easier to say than to do. I know. I've done it. I'm entirely self-taught. I've never had a teacher who taught me anything about programming that I didn't already know better than they did. This isn't arrogance. That's what most people will assume when they read a bold assertion like that. Most people will immediately take the side of the teacher(s) and against the student. But I'm prepared to back it up. I have more professional programming experience than any professor I've had, usually by a huge ratio. I have bachelors and masters degrees in the subject from large, public ABET accredited universities. I graduated at the top of my classes too. It's a long story, but here's the summary. I dropped out of university after 1 semester when I realized that the computer science program at my university was obsolete with fundamental problems. (I had excellent grades - so this was not an after-the fact justification for failure). I already had about 4 years worth of programming experience before university, including successfully completing paid programming contracts). I worked as a programmer, developer, and consultant for the next 15 years without a break. I always had a new job lined up before leaving the last one. I took a few classes while I was working just to get credit for what I already knew, but then I decided to finish my degrees, since that was always a personal goal of mine. It also would let me be qualified to teach. So I went back to school and got my degrees. I had some good teachers and a lot of bad ones, but none of them even came close to the amount of proven experience that I had. I gained some insight to why there are so many bad computer science professors. A PhD doesn't ensure programming proficiency. The vast majority of computer science professors get their first faculty position within one year of earning their PhD. This system creates a safe harbor for incompetent programmers who couldn't hold a job in the industry if their lives depended on it. The system is also self-supporting and self-reinforcing. Incompetent professors tend to get on the committees to hire more incompetent professors. They have worked hard to eliminate any independent verification of competence within the system.
&gt; I use those free products along with thousand of web applications around the world. You seem to think that one of the most widely used web frameworks in the world will fail in the near future. It is possible but I would not bet on it. Could you clarify the claim you're making a bit? What subset of JEE are you claiming as one of the most used web frameworks in the world? Various de facto standard technologies over the Servlet interface over Tomcat and Jetty certainly are, but are you claiming the same for EJB?
First you need to find the nearest two perfect two squares. One that is higher and one that is lower then your number. You can find the roots of those perfect square by taking the root of your number and rounding that up and down. Once you have the roots of the perfect squares you can get the perfect squares by squaring both numbers. Once you have both perfect squares you can compare which one is closer. Once you know that you can return its root. (Coincidently it is the same as your the root of your number rounded up or down). You should be able to find the function you need here: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html
That's a great metaphor! Programming is a bittersweet love, but when you succeed it makes all the failures before worth it.
The site, www.codeacademy.com is a great place to start. I recommend starting with the Python programming language, it's really easy to get into but you can do anything you want in Python that you can do in other languages, like Java. After you finish the codeacademy stuff for Python, I recommend [the official python tutorial](http://docs.python.org/3.3/tutorial/). It will be quite similar to the codeacademy stuff, but it's really important to do this! Because, codeacademy shows you the material in an informal sort of way, but the Python tutorial is much more formal about their approach (Although it's still geared towards beginners). This is good, because you'll have an understanding of things from codeacademy, and you can relate it to the more official version of things. Its like teaching someone chemistry for the first time, you might start with "all the objects around us are made of really tiny things that stick together". They might think, "okay, I can understand that." Then, you introduce them to the concept one step further: "Everything, also called *matter*, is made of *molecules*". Now you've introduced them to formal vocabulary and slightly more advanced concepts, but they can still relate it back to the more basic definition, which is something that really helps people understand! Good luck with it, and I hope you stick with it until the end of the tutorials. Feel free to PM me again if you get stuck!
The Socratic Method really works.
Are you from CBHS??
So if i ceil the number square rooted and floor it and create an double for both(x, y) of those squared, than i do the higher square minus the first number and make that x2 and then first number minus the lower square and make that y2 than &gt; If (x2 &gt; y2) { &gt; width = x; &gt; height = x; } &gt; else { &gt; width = y; &gt; height = y; } like that? 
Are you in the US? There are high schools that offer programming classes for students. Our district actually employs a full time computer science teacher. She gets her students to write awesome programs with her classes - everything from hard-coding/text-only output to high level, game output stuff (like that MIT programming kit for kids). Look around and get paid for your passion! ...but not in the prostitute sort of way.
No you don't. You just can't do it full time. Your university has to have some sort of programming 101 classes or so and it'd be willing to bet that there are students who would pay to get tutoring. DO THIS. It is awesome stuff to have on a resume.
Not arguing that at all. Just wanted to make sure you knew why she wasn't using her own materials :)
Sorry. I couldn't make sense of the sentence or the code. In pseudo code what I said was this: lowerPerfectSqaureRoot = floor(sqrt(your_number)) lowerPerfectSqaure = lowerPerfectSqaureRoot^2 upperPerfectSqaureRoot = ceil(sqrt(your_number)) upperPerfectSqaure = upperPerfectSqaureRoot ^2 if(your_number - lowerPerfectSqaure &lt; upperPerfectSqaure - your_number ){ return lowerPerfectSqaureRoot else { return upperPerfectSqaureRoot } You'll have to do some work to make it work though.
Yeah, it's difficult sometimes! But when the person you're explaining things to is so eager to learn, it isn't too hard!
Damn.. this thread is bringing back some memories.. my first encounters with programming .. 7 years ago.. now it all seems so natural to me.. no wonder we call them programming "languages".
I took programing in High School and the teacher for the class was the Soccer coach who knew nothing about programming let alone how to operate a computer properly. It in turn made me hate programming and not pursue it any further which I still regret to this day.

That's the beauty of it... He's not teaching him anything. He is getting him to focus on the steps sequentially and to think it through enough to answer the questions. Turns out this is basically the key to success in...everything 
I liked grid world only for the final project which was to turn it into a game. Using any resources you wanted to add, but it needed to use grid world. RPGs are fun to make anywhere!
While it is indeed complicated, I would wager a guess that they would be able to just show students part of it. GridWorld has a huge amount of classes running a platform for what students actually work with, and I'd imagine the concept would be the same. Also the large modding community could help explain any instance fields or methods the kid is curious about.
I've done several years worth of stuff before I entered university, so don't feel bad! Python's a great starting language, by the way! Very friendly with beginners and a pleasure to work with.
Oh yea thats basically what i was trying to say. Thanks man! or woman 
Still a first year university student!
Thanks, but I wish I didn't need it. :/ Edit: Quick fix
That's true! I bet Comp Sci enrollment would increase by a factor of two if they started using Minecraft as the case study!
My last GridWorld assignment was to make it bubble sort an array of differently shaded squares in order of brightest to darkest. I wish I had your assignment!
We had free reign to do what we pleased. It was really fun :) sadly only a 2 week dev time with 1 hour per weekday but DAMN it was cool. Still using it as a part of my portfolio. Decent result and totally dynamic.
Working off your questions posted below: 1) You have two objectives. First, create a Student class, and second create a GradeCalculator class which *uses* the Student class. The only class which is actually going to be doing something is the GradeCalculator class; your Student class doesn't actually need a **main** method. It also doesn't need a Scanner because you won't need to accept input until later, in the GradeCalculator class. Think about it like this: your Student class is a template, from which you can make many students. It doesn't actually take input. Your GradeCalculator class *does* need to, because you want to take input and create new students (from your Student template). I'll go through your methods one by one: getName() - this is good to go, although you don't actually need the + " \n"; you can just return name (unless you're doing that for aesthetics. getmidterm() - remember: when you have a double someMethod(), it has to return a double. Currently, yours just prints sentences. Also, in the else statement you tell us that the grade is recorded, but that's not what a get class is for. The get class should *get* us the value. How can it do that? getfinalExam() - you've got the same issues as the getmidterm() method. getfinalGrade() - This is good, except for one thing: you're assigning the result to a variable and then printing that variable. All you need to do is return the final grade! showGrades() - when you're adding strings together(it's called concatenating), you need pluses between every element you're putting together. You're currently missing two. Now, you've got all of your **get** methods... but what about the **set** methods? These should take a parameter (e.g. setMidterm(double grade)) and assign it to the appropriate instance variable. Once you've got that good to go, post it here and I'll help you with the second part. 
That is partly the instructors fault. When I took the course my teacher throw in his own variations of assignments that would help us. Including an end of the year project, which we had from after the AP test to break to do. Of course me and my partner fapped on reddit till the last day then spent all day and night working on it.
That's pretty impressive that you can walk someone through that when you are still learning yourself. How much experience do you have outside of school?
learning to think is the most critical step in anything. you'd think we'd have found a way to teach this skill by now, but nope.
Sounds like fun, if I lived in the US I'd probably go for this one!
Holy crap, 13 months of gold
This whole thread makes me want to explore coding 
My AP Java teacher in high school sat us in front of a computer with a Java book and basically said "Write code". So we spent the whole year on Facebook. Granted, we had a ton of C++ experience, but Java is still a whole new ballgame and tough for some 16 year olds to figure out with zero guidance.
I never did much with grid world. I played with fang instead. Final project of that class was to make a board game. I decided to go over the top and make monopoly while everyone else was doing chutes and ladders or something.
Is that when you write a number in the base with the most 4s, thereby finding the fouriest base?
Grid world is gone in the next two years. (I THINK that includes this year.)
"See this? It's a fish. Learn it."
You're awesome, such a beautifully quick way to teach the programming fundamentals. Thank you.
Was gonna say, if half my TA's were like you, I'd have stayed a CS major (many moons ago). Good luck!
It's possible the "information age" has been a contributing factor here and plays a role in our decline in the area of math and STEM fields in general. I have read (take this anecdotally since I can't provide a source) that people's ability to remember specific types of facts has diminished because there is no longer a need to keep any types of information in our "long term storage", it's bookmarked right? For me, what was addicting about math and programming was that I didn't get it up front. I fell in love with that feeling that something was beyond my ability to comprehend, and then beating it. The moment you accomplish something you never thought possible is such a huge rush. Yet people seem to have lost their understanding that doing this regularly is More possible today than ever. if they could just pursue education for knowledge and the fulfillment rather than a job/degree. Today, our society functions in a way that makes immediate results the expected outcome but truly understanding the depths of something will never come without the requisite "10 thousand hours" 
Lecture halls for 500+ students for Software Development and Java, fortunately, don't exist. I went to one of the largest universities in the US for undegrad and I think that would have been half of the CS department. Hell, I don't even think my Chem 1 and Calc 1 lectures were that big (although that might be because there weren't lecture halls that could fit more than 300-400). There are probably Universities with bigger departments, proportionally, but not 10x.
Right? My switch from C++ to Java was terrible. The teacher scrolled through code and talked about it. Then assigned projects. Never posted source code. I hated it.
I didn't have access to a machine to code on at the age of 13... Guess I should have given up.
I was a peer tutor while attending Basic Electronics school in the US Navy. High GPA'd students got out of duty for being a tutor, which kept me from shoveling snow or standing watch. At "A" school thereafter, I was chosen to stay behind and teach instead of go out to the fleet. Gov red tape nixed that, and I went to my ship. In my division I was selected as "Training Petty Officer", which entailed holding weekly training that we all loved so much &gt;s. 3 years later, I accept shore duty as a calibration/electronics instructor. Loved every minute of it. Thesedays, my class is composed of my son, who's into electronics, gaming, programming, and everything outdoors, and I love to teach. Guess what I'm saying is: tl;dr Start with tutoring, it could result in a future of teaching in all aspects of your life. It will also make you live a life of learning, keeping pace with the next thing for you to pass on. 
You'll notice it in any serious practical application of knowledge. Alot of people deal with a similiar block when studying the occult. 
Learning how to self-teach *is* one of the basics. You won't get very far in programming if you don't learn that skill. There's nothing wrong with asking for help and kristler did a wonderful job of leading you to the answer, but you could have found it on your own too. All of the methods and properties were named in a pretty self-explanatory fashion, so you would have figured it out with some more experimentation.
You are going to need Maven. What problems occur when you try to install maven?

He's clearly had experience before College in these areas. 
living in a house of boys who don't, I get this. 
According to my apcs teacher, they're changing it next year.
There is no reason to learn JSP, JSTL or EL, since nobody in their right minds would actually use it in new projects in 2014. It's arguably the worst of the widely available templating systems for Java, simply because of the historical crud in implementation details which have been, in hindsight, foolishly been locked into the standard. Sure, JSP is very reminicient of PHP, but that's because they are both from an era when we didn't have a wealth of experience of what happens when you encourage putting business logic into templates. Play and Grails both have their own templating systems, and Spring of course supports Velocity, FreeMarker, and Thymeleaf.
Jesus Christ, you are a patient person.
You may also print out the lesson you just had here as an example of how it can be explained without giving you all the answers. Sorry your teacher is being such a douche. You should not have to go online for your questions.
I wonder if she knows how to code properly. It could be she has no clue what she is doing.
to be honest thats the exact reason i loved getting my engineering degree. of course the field is totally different and i use maybe a quarter of what i learned (in terms of methods and facts), but the coursework forced me to learn to think. I know the feeling you are describing, it was amazing towards the second half of my education when it all clicked and i started knowing exactly how to tackle a problem, even one where i had no idea what i was doing. that was all because the first half of my degree taught me how to think and solve problems without getting frustrated or upset that i was stuck. I used to get funny looks and whatnot from the lib arts guys in my fraternity when i'd start dancing in the study room. the stem guys all knew what i was doing though. that was a fun in joke.
Being able to figure out how to solve the problem at hand and not to give up is important, but please do not underestimate the importance of knowing and understanding the tools and concepts in the language and environment you are using. If you don't get the fundamental concepts, you will not be able to understand and apply the higher level concepts that build on them. Also, if you don't know the names of concepts, you will be unable to research them and will have trouble collaborating with others. A analogy, learning to use a variable speed drill. 0) I need to make a hole and I have no idea how one can make holes in things. I tried hitting the wood hard with the pointy end and it made a dent so I guess I will just keep banging on. (Non-programmer trying to program) 1) Wow, this thing is great at making holes using the trigger. The holes usually aren't the right size but hey, I can use this hole maker thing pretty well. (Novice, aka you, can get the job done, more or less) 2) Turns out this tthing is called a drill and has things called 'bits' that you can swap out! Now my holes are always the right size! I was talking to someone about my drill and bits and he told me about bits you can use to make square holes that I never knew was possible (next step for you, able to learn more concepts and solve problems that you never were able to, or required a lot more code than necessary) 3) Wow, the drill can also be used to drive screws and other rotary tools. (Experienced) 4) I used my drill to make a jury-rigged lathe. (Mastered the tool and can use it in novel ways) Happy programming and learning!
That gives me hope. I *can* program or at least hack out something that works but every step is a chore and most of the time I know my code sucks but I don't know what exactly is bad about it. I figured programming was not for me but maybe I just need to keep at it.
Also, engineering guy in a fraternity? Wat? Lol
Weeelll..programming is a tiny sliver of what CS is. 
you could post the maven error, but i also get annoyed at bloated stuff, maven and eclipse (gigabytes of software, gigabytes of ram usage, a pom.xml build script that is over 100 lines....all to compile a few java sources files!!! here is how i would do it in 4 lines (linux/unix/mac...windows might need powershell or cygwin) get the software: &gt; git clone https://github.com/savagehomeautomation/raspi-sspc.git get the dependency (this should not be required since it should be included in git) &gt; wget https://pi4j.googlecode.com/files/pi4j-core-0.0.4-SNAPSHOT.jar edit the software...chance your one line, then build it &gt; mkdir out; javac -cp pi4j-core-0.0.4-SNAPSHOT.jar -d out `find raspi-sspc/src -iname *.java` then create the jar file &gt; jar -cf raspi-sspc.jar -C out . 
WOW! Seriously- you have a gift. So glad that your talent for teaching lines up with your passion for teaching. You will do great things in this world. 
I took AP CS the last year it was the fish tank case study. Then took it again the next year when they changed it to Gridworld. I prefered grid world.
Not answering because it's an assignment? Why do you think he posted, retard? If you aren't going to do it for him then don't post.
Ah, I didn't mean to say I was better than the other students, I was just giving an example of what was expected compared to what I decided to do. I definitely agree that the fun in programming is making something work.
Oh that's great! It's about time we got something new.
Sure. Anything to make learning coding easier would be awesome!
I used to teach kids with learning disabilities in high school, and it's definitely paid off!
You can always PM me if you have questions!
We recorded at this little studio, not sure where exactly...it's been a long time. Cool thing was that it was where The Specials recorded Ghost Town. I'm a huge ska fan so I flipped out when I saw the gold record framed on the wall. I learned that day that The Selecter are also from Cov. If you're into alt/metal at all check out Thoria if they perform, good band.
That must be why all of the people that invented the entire field were younger than 13. I find your premise flawed in so many ways that I don't even know how to address it. An outlook that amounts to "give up and do not even try" is so limiting...
Sounds to me like you'll be fine
Hey I thought it was "Teach a man Finnish". That shits hard.
Sorry man, didn't realize this thread was about insulting people, I'll go find a sub with less douchiness. 
This is what tutors are for. Shitty tutors still exist though, but so do good teachers.
A big problem is that it is intimidating asking teachers for help. One of the best programming teachers I've ever had emphasized how much he was willing to help us. I don't know if your class structure allows you to do this(my class was for competitive programming), but he actively walked around looking at our screens. One HUGE thing for students that need help is that too often, people say they don't need help when they really do. If you think that a student is lagging behind, ask him questions relevant to what he's doing to find out if he knows how to do it. Simply asking him whether he needs help is intimidating, puts the student on the spot, and is easier for the student to just say no. This is my experience in programming teachers. EDIT: I missed your online part. Imo, teaching anything online without voice chat and preferably screen sharing tends to fail.
haha, I get that a lot actually. As I'm sure you know, the best way to be a success after college is to find balance in college. you don't need to learn just your field, the social skills and relationships you foster are just as important, if not more so. A fraternity is not right for everybody, but the house I joined was extremely important for me. College made me an engineer, but my fraternity made me a man. Some houses (and this varies from chapter to chapter, there is no perfect fraternity) are pretty similar to the stereotype, which is fine by me, but my chapter strove to be what the founders of fraternities envisioned: a place to take young men and make them better. My chapter taught me social skills and leadership skills which I wouldn't have learned elsewhere, and were a huge benefit for my group projects and other endeavours. Probably the best thing my house did for me though was send me on a young leaders retreat. It was a week long event that covered a few key skills to being an effective leader (planning, communication, utilization of individuals' skillsets, taking charge, putting things in motion, correcting error, and recognizing when to follow and when to lead). it was a life changing experience for me, and I learned more about life during that week than I ever have before or since. and to be honest, the social aspect was incredible, both for confidence and learning, and fun. having a packed social calendar gave me things to look forward to and reasons to stay on top of my work, and to learn efficiency, which is a skill not as many of my academic peers had. 
Don't rely on office hours. Walk around the classroom during class time looking for students that need help. If you think a student is lagging behind, or doesn't understand what to do, ask him questions to figure out whether he knows what to do. Relying just on "Do you need help?" will elicit a no from the majority of students, even if they have little idea about what to do. I know that I've found many of my programming teachers to be somewhat intimidating, and even for the best one I've had, asking him a question was somewhat intimidating. Don't think that students who need help will seek help from you. 
In Debug perspective, the Display view is a REPL where you can execute arbitrary code on the current stack frame.
Yeah I was mostly joking but had a friend that was a mechanical engineering major at Michigan tech and was in a fraternity and those guys were crazy. It's good to hear that some of them are more useful. It's important for young students to set down those social roots as they move away from their lives they lived for the past 18 or more years. Great to hear. 
Slightly difficult with a lecture hall of between 100 and 200 students in aisles 10 wide... The point is valid, but it is a size thing again. I only have 1500 minutes of class time in a quarter. That means, if I were to teach absolutely nothing, I could spend 7.5-15 minutes per student over the quarter. Or if you want to go by day, 15-30 seconds per student per day. Again, this is assuming I teach absolutely zero material. In reality, well over half of lectures are taken up with actually lecturing, so it is more like 5-10 seconds per student per day. If I get 4 students within earshot with the same problem, I can spend 40 seconds on it. On the flip side I have ~100 hours of office hours that typically goes empty.
The site, www.codeacademy.com is a great place to start. I recommend starting with the Python programming language, it's really easy to get into but you can do anything you want in Python that you can do in other languages, like Java. After you finish the codeacademy stuff for Python, I recommend [the official python tutorial](http://docs.python.org/3.3/tutorial/). It will be quite similar to the codeacademy stuff, but it's really important to do this! Because, codeacademy shows you the material in an informal sort of way, but the Python tutorial is much more formal about their approach (Although it's still geared towards beginners). This is good, because you'll have an understanding of things from codeacademy, and you can relate it to the more official version of things. Its like teaching someone chemistry for the first time, you might start with "all the objects around us are made of really tiny things that stick together". They might think, "okay, I can understand that." Then, you introduce them to the concept one step further: "Everything, also called *matter*, is made of *molecules*". Now you've introduced them to formal vocabulary and slightly more advanced concepts, but they can still relate it back to the more basic definition, which is something that really helps people understand! Good luck with it, and I hope you stick with it until the end of the tutorials. Feel free to PM me again if you get stuck!
You are absolutely a phenomenal person. People like you make a massive difference in the world, please keep being awesome.
Oh honey just wait until your bug has to do recursive fibonacci bullshit
It's crazy how rapidly you can figure out every step in this process when you get some years of experience down.
Likewise, its awesome to hear somebody in the field be open to the idea of fraternities. many of my peers looked down upon me for it. I once overheard a couple of guys making fun of me for wearing my letters in the engineering library right before finals week. Turns out we had a final together, which i wore my letters to. being one of the first few to finish (and doing well) on that final felt pretty good.

And we're back to penis jokes. You did good for awhile, Reddit.
I used to think the same: "Teachers need to spend their time, one-on-one, to ensure every question is answered and every student leaves the classroom with full knowledge of the material. It's what they're paid to do, right? Anything less is just laziness on their part..." Then, I started teaching small groups of 10-15 students (mostly programming teachers, no less) and quickly realized that a classroom simply does not work that way. Move too fast, and you will quickly lose the students who are new to the content or are slower to pick up the concepts (those for whom the ideas haven't quit 'clicked' yet). Move too slowly, though, and those that are either experienced or can quickly pick up new concepts will get bored and potentially fall behind through lack of interest. Multiply that by a factor of 10~20 (for the number of students ResilientBiscuit is teaching at once), add in the limited time schedules to cover a very set amount of content, and suddenly the teacher(s) is faced with difficult choices day-to-day. The solution? Make the best gameplan you can for the class, factor in some flex time if possible, and implement modern (and classic!) teaching philosophies and methods such as differentiated instruction. All that being said, a class can go great until it hits a brick wall or a curveball that you didn't see coming and had no way to predict. It inevitably happens, and the best thing you can do as a teacher is try to keep control of the classroom and bring it back on track best you can. While the one-on-one help here was fantastic (guiding the OP to the solution instead of simply giving it to him/her), it's not always feasible to do in the classroom, so please don't judge too harshly :) 
I really appreciate you taking the time to do that for me! So the file that you modified is in raspi-sspc--&gt;target--&gt;sspc-1.01-SNAPSHOT.jar, correct?
The "sysout" is a built in Template in Eclipse. You can even make your own! Tired of typing out something you use a lot? Like say a typed ArrayList? Make a template for it!
This. In OOP we have one main/client class which references other classes you have. The reason you're confused is because Part 1 simply asks you to make a Student class with no main method. The GradeCalculator class is supposed to be your client class that instantiates 5 Student objects in an array and asks for user input via a Scanner object. Wrapping your head around OOP is difficult at first. The whole point of OOP is to have modular blocks of code - there is one main class that simply references other classes. With no main class, your program should do nothing and just be a bunch of classes. You need to make a Student class that consists only of getters, setters, and "other" methods with no main method. Also regarding your code specficially, ketzo pointed out a bunch of errors but also be cognizant of compiler errors in general. These are errors made in the syntax of your code that should be detected by your IDE (the software program which you are using to code). If you are using something like Eclipse, then it should point out places with incorrect code with red squiggly underlines. In your class you are missing several brackets. This must be fixed or your program will not run at all (you must have no red squiggly underlines, yellow squiggly underlines are okay). You are missing closing "}" brackets at lines 42 and 51 and an opening "{" bracket at line 59. Style-wise, you have a public property/instance variable (public double finalGrade). Your professor may not be as strict on this, but it's considered good style for properties to always be private. In addition, your indents are all over the place, but this may just be Reddit formatting. Indentations are important for human readability, and it was significantly more difficult for me in reading your code than it would have been had your code had correct indentations. You also have a { bracket on the same line as the class declaration whereas everywhere else you have the { on the next line. Again, these are all stylistic things, but a good programming teacher will tell you to stay consistent in style for the sake of making future code editing more efficient.
If there were more TAs who were really interested in teaching it would be a huge asset, but more often than not, they are interested in research rather than education if they are at grad school and undergrad TAs can be really hit or miss too. Another good tool I use are online message boards where students can upvote good questions, not unlike a popular website I have heard of. It makes it easy to see what materials need to be covered better.

I actually remember doing this very program. For your turtle to turn, you have to have a method *turnRight()* that indicates the angle at which your turtle will turn. In *turnRight()* it should define the angle (90^o in this case), so redefine it. Add a parameter to the method so that you can specify how much to turn the turtle on the call. Then figure out a way to make sure that on a subsequent call, the new angle will be combined with the old angle. That's basically all I can give you without actually pasting the answer. EDIT: I just thought of something else. For each shape that you're drawing, you're defining a new method and manually filling in the values for how much the turtle should turn. Here's a hint: in each of those shapes, how many degrees with the turtle turn before it's complete? Take that answer, and use it to determine how many degrees the turtle will turn for each shape. Think geometry.
I think starting something like that is a little beyond me, but if anyone starts something like that I'd love to contribute!
Wow, Java is awful. 
I probably shouldn't bother to reply but... &gt; JEE servers legitimately offered businesses commensurate business value, but since that's been a thing of the past for many years now If Java EE servers had no value then people wouldn't use them. Just because you don't like the business model doesn't de-value the software. &gt; However, the EJB legacy architecture, which the application server license business are built on, has been obsolete now for a few years. EJBs had some complexity issue and that gave rise to Spring with was a good thing because that applied pressure to Sun to fix EJBs. EJBs have been fully updated and the 3.X versions are not legacy in any way. Here is a 5 year old article that details some of the reason EJBs are not legacy technology anymore: http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-10-2008/jw-10-ejb3.html. The only thing to me that is legacy about EJBs today might be the remoting capability of session beans that has been largely replaced by web services. There has been some talk about pruning that in the future. And while EJBs can play a major piece in an EE application you act like Java EE is comprised of Servlets and EJBs and has no other technologies value. JMS, JNDI, JAX-RS, JAX-WS, CDI, JPA, just to name a few are all Java EE technologies and are extremely useful. &gt; those wacky marketing people and their comical belief that rebranding will solve their obsolecense problem. The Java language was at version 2 for a long time. When it finally changed they had to remove the 2. They smartly moved the version number to the end now so that the number isn't part of the name and is just a version number. Are you really angry that they picked Java EE instead of JEE? I'm mean really, would you pronounce that gee? As I already pointed out (https://java.net/projects/javaee-spec/pages/JEE) JEE is not a name that is recognized by the creators and maintainers of the platform and using it shows that even if you have been keeping up with Java you haven't been reading any first hand information about the platform so you don't seem to be well informed. I wouldn't hire someone that listed JEE experience because it shows a lack of study just like I wouldn't hire someone that referred to .Net as Dot-Net. &gt; TomEE isn't a realistic alternative Every single application server poll shows Tomcat as the most popular server by far. But almost every single use of Tomcat had to add in at least one additional library, very commonly Hibernate (JPA) or a JAX-RS implementation. TomEE just makes it easy and does it all for you. I expect TomEE to become extremely popular in the next couple of years. &gt; WildFly will be developed just as long as the application server license sales business have a few big legacy customers, who haven't yet audited their IT spending for wastage. Businesses need supported software, they can not use something that can break with no way to fix it. They have two options; pay for external support or pay for in-house support. It can be difficult to find and retain the expertise of a large complex framework. If it wasn't Java EE it'd be some other framework like Spring. Yes WebLogic and WebSphere can be expensive but don't you think a large number of companies have looked at the amount of effort required to replace them already and found it would cost more to stop using them? I think the price will be driven down to some degree but not much. What is going to happen (and already is to some degree) is Java EE will become the API for cloud development. The profit will come from managing the servers. Red Hat has OpenShift, Amazon has Elastic Beanstalk, Oracle has their Java Cloud offering, CloudBees, etc. &gt; Once the funding dries up, there aren't any user organizations holding the JEE facade up, since its development is entirely product sales driven. With no real money coming in, further development in the EJB legacy space will simply dry up, and the products will be left to rot, which is the Computer Associates business model. If Java standardization dies then most of the vendors that offer Java die. Look at what choices you have for most enterprise development, you have Microsoft's .Net and Java and that is pretty much it. Google managed to have success with a fragmented Java (Android) but that was because a) Sun missed the opportunity b) they had tons of money to throw at it. And Google did it to keep from getting frozen out of search and ads in a post-pc world. Why did RedHat buy JBoss? Because without Java their entire portfolio of offerings is less viable. If the application server pricing floor ever drops out RedHat will still have to offer Java. Same goes for Oracle, if people suddenly switch to .Net they are only one step away from switching to SQL server. Standardized Java makes all these other things viable. A fragmented and non-standardized Java platform isn't going to make things cheaper, it'll like to someone like Google throwing enough resources into their offering that they effectively become a monopoly. Imagine if Java EE had just packed up and left when Spring came out. Do you really think there would be a lot of other viable alternatives or that Spring would be cheaper? You aren't wrong to sale it is Java EE development is sales driven but then so is almost every aspect of software development even those non-standard pieces like Spring. Where you are wrong is in your assumption that the licensing of application servers are the only sales that drive the continuation of Java EE. &gt; TomEE as a project is lucky it has so few users, given how few resources they have to fix bugs, as evidenced from their JIRA and version control. To describe it as a relevant alternative to an user organization which treats bugs in software as a statistical reality which needs credible controls in place, is leaving something quite important out of the picture. Do you see how this statement could be an argument for paying for one of those expensive application servers? &gt; You referred to inside knowledge of discussions between "those who create and maintain the technology". Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that you're affiliated with them, and one way or another, stand to profit from cash flow into JEE/EJB development. Have you looked at how the Java community process works? Almost all the Java standards are developed in the open. They should all have public mailing lists that anyone can read or participate in. Sure maybe most of profit from Java EE but that is because we like to have paying jobs. We learn technologies so we can be employable. Some of us learn to care about those technologies and become more involved in some ways like going to users groups or joining mailing lists. Just because we care and learn about our craft doesn't make us shady application server sales people that are out to steal all your money. &gt; based on Googling (sorry, "searching with Google.com (TM)") oracle.com, which rather changes the amount of credence and interpretation I would have otherwise given to the statement. If you are trying to say that doing a Google search for JEE turns up a lot of oracle.com results the yes you are correct. But take the time to go to each result and look for JEE on the page. I think this might be googles doing. 
It's a limitation of IEEE 754. There are loads of binary number systems that would never have this issue, they just may use more time and space. No one ever wants to have rounding errors, they're never desirable and as such are never features (by this I use features in the same context in which you did in your first case, i.e. feature and error mutually exclusive). They are however a necessary evil if we want to be able to run trillions of the operations each second, at least for the time being. If by feature you mean 'It happens as defined, so it's not the fault of the spec', well, you're right, but then the untrained users who think it's a mistake would still be right, because the programmer's used the wrong tools for the job.
That depends on the engine/libraries you are using. Are you using something like Slick2D that has OpenGL support? Engines such as that have functions to make it a trivial task. Java Monkey Engine is my personal favorite even though it is designed for 3D games. check out /r/javagamedev
if you're referring to having to use getter and setter methods, you don't really have any idea what encapsulation is...

I know right!! now if only Kristler can go instruct the noobs running the Obamacare site... 
Well if k = 2 and the numbers after are 1 2 3 4 5 6, you will have 3 groups each a size of 2. That means g1 = 1 and 2, g2 = 3 and 4, g3 is 5 and 6. Then ur supposed to multiply the numbers in each group with each other, so g1 = 2, g2 = 12 and g3 = 30, the last part is to add all the groups together så 2 + 12 + 30

Java can definitely be used to design a webapp/PHP-style website. Personally, I have found a great amount of success with [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/home). Packaged with the right tools (Apache Tomcat or Glassfish), Java can serve as a very powerful web-delivered language and will also expose you to a lot of other tools. I wouldn't have a clue about XML if it wasn't for tomcat and Java, for instance.
No problem, man. If you're using Dr. Java (which is a terrible IDE, BTW) then I've probably done many of the programs that you're doing. I don't helping at all. When you get the time, learn to use a new IDE like Eclipse or CloudEnvy. They may look frightening, but just try it out. You'll hate yourself for using Dr. Java.
Interesting! I hope it's a change for the good and not a backwards step.
You're in the wrong sub. Java != Javascript. Although I'm sure someone could answer (I definitely can't,) check out /r/javascript instead.
You've missed a trick here, I'm afraid. You claim that people will get confused by /u/mikaelhg using the term JEE instead of the more verbose Java EE. Unfortunately, that's not really true in a subreddit about Java, and you've just gone off topic fairly majorly which isn't really desirable in a discussion, especially not on something so petty.

&gt; If Java EE servers had no value then people wouldn't use them. Yes, that's what has been happening over the last 5 years, fewer and fewer applications have been deployed on new JEE server installations. As user organizations are implementing non-proprietary PaaS solutions, this will continue exponentially. Actually, I've seen this being regarded as a big minus on Red Hat's PaaS platform, that they seem to want to push JBoss into places where it doesn't make any sense for any user organizations. &gt; JMS, JNDI, JAX-RS, JAX-WS, CDI, JPA, just to name a few are all Java EE technologies and are extremely useful. JMS has largely been replaced in non-legacy projects with AMQP based servers, as the protocol standardization provides much better value than the JMS provider lock-in. JNDI is trivial, and has been replaced with injection. JAX-RS and JAX-WS were almost immediately overtaken by the REST / JSON standardization layer. In the real world, nobody cares about how it's implemented, as long as the solutions match the overall architecture, and the REST interfaces serve the business. CDI is a complete rip-off of the market leaders, and hasn't seen much takeoff beyond blog posts sponsored one way or another. JPA has been a bastardization of Hibernate, and the actual compatibility between providers is a joke. You're just as well off with sticking with one ORM. &gt; JEE is not a name that is recognized by the creators and maintainers of the platform Yes, it's what the people they're marketing it to call it. It's OK that corporate marketing departments have their own opinions, as they always do. As with the previous SJSAS example, people will continue to ignore their funny little ways. &gt; If Java standardization dies then most of the vendors that offer Java die. Yes, they will go the way of horses and buggies, that's what happens to obsolete business models of bygone eras. The world will always move on, and the technology world has already moved on from EJBs and the rest of the crud standardized by people who haven't seen the trenches for decades, if ever. &gt;&gt; TomEE as a project is lucky it has so few users... &gt; Do you see how this statement could be an argument for paying for one of those expensive application servers? Yes, if JEE offered commensurate business value to user organizations, which it doesn't. The world has moved by, applications are written for browsers and backends are mostly stateless. And what do you know, the world didn't end when it changed. &gt; Sure maybe most of profit from Java EE but that is because we like to have paying jobs. Here we arrive to the crux of the problem, the conflict of interests between user organizations which use these tools to solve business problems, and license sales and development organizations. The world has moved largely away from this model, which was formed when software was delivered on tapes and diskettes. Now these tools are built by networks of user organizations each investing a little, but without the impedance mismatch between the interests of the product manager concentrating on product sales meetings, and the actual users of the products. Now the users are in the driver's seat, which is tremendous to our project completion, project portfolio risk management, and planning. I understand that some product sales companies would very much like for the world to regress, but that's not happening. We're done with lock-in. &gt; If you are trying to say that doing a Google search for JEE... No, I was referring to the other guy's comment. Turns out that he pulled that out of his hat, and based his statement on a simple google search.
Because if someone tells you the answer you won't learn how to think for yourself so you may as well drop the class. You need to learn how to solve problems generally, not how to fix that one specific problem in the class. 
I can hear the buzz of electricity, but the light bulb isn't quite on yet :P. So think about the overall shape that the turtle forms after completing. Triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon - there's a specific number that is common to all of those shapes. Start there. Once you figure out that number, use it to calculate the angle by dividing it by a number n. Your variable n will differ in the triangle, the square and the pentagon, but think about *how* it'll be different. What's so different about a triangle, square and pentagon? You're probably thinking, "Well duh, it's..., but it can't be that simple." It is that simple. Use that as your divisor. Figuring all of this out is basic geometry. Use that knowledge to your advantage. Lastly, you can't make a method equal anything, but you can use specific parameters to pass on to your method: public int turnRight(int parameter) { } Use the parameter to turn your turtle. As I said before, you need to be careful with this method. Make sure the turtle *turns a specific angle* each time rather than reset to a a given angle. To make a triangle, a turtle can't sit at 0^o turn 90^o reset to 0^o turn 90^o reset to 0^o and turn 90^o because that will make a straight line. It needs to start at 0^o , turn 90^o , turn another 90^o and turn another 90^o . Use that information to create your turn method. Edit: Clarity.

Go home /u/Reads_Small_Text_Bot. You're drunk. 
It's really hard for people to help each other if you don't provide any code. Even psuedo-code would suffice to let us understand what or where the problem truly lies. 
&gt; CDI is a complete rip-off of the market leaders, and hasn't seen much takeoff beyond blog posts sponsored one way or another. Yeah because it isn't like the Seam guys went out and authored the CDI spec and then created Weld which is the reference implementation. &gt; JPA has been a bastardization of Hibernate, and the actual compatibility between providers is a joke. You're just as well off with sticking with one ORM. And another case where the Hibernate guys were on the expert group for JPA. Compatibility is only a joke if you use extensions, you choose between portability and convenience. You can wait until the extensions become a part of the standard but then you'll always be waiting because the standards are meant for standardization and not innovation. Do you really think having completely separate ORM solutions like Hibernate and JDO was a good thing? &gt; We're done with lock-in. This is what I don't get about your argument. You hate lock-in but also hate standardization. Don't you get that those free single vendor solutions are locking you in?
 public class ImageLoader{ BufferedImage image; public ImageLoader(){ try{ imageName = ImageIO.read(new File("res//image.jpg")); }catch(IOException e){ e.printStackTrace(); } } } This is an example of importing a single image, you can import as many as you want this way. In this example there is a folder called res in the project folder, inside the res folder is a file called image.jpg. You can learn about the drawImage() method here: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics.html Let me know if you have further questions on how to implement that.
Like /u/Rippera said, we need some kind of code to really help you, but I think I can make a few assumptions. You're using Swing components and have some sort of GUI, or you're drawing with Graphics. Either way, I think you need to reorganize your code. If you're waiting on something like a mouse click or key press, implement ActionListener. If you're just want components drawn in a certain order, rewrite your code so that it is executed in a top-down manner. Have the compiler parse the code, and then interrupt the code with a call to your drawing/rendering method.
My teacher made us create entire programs from scratch. Things from video poker to jeopardy. With gridworld, we had to make the classes from scratch as well. We didn't start gridworld until we were 3/4 done with the entire curriculum. This way, we could use gridworld to our full advantage.
That's really good! My course was online, so I suppose we didn't have the luxury of doing things like that. At least I didn't need to learn anything from that course, I just wanted the credit.
I have friends who are looking, I'll show them this thread.
We had our tests online... Oh god was it horrible.. "How do you increment this variable: int k = 0; " I put ++k WRONG. It was k++ Luckily my teacher was understanding when I screenshotted a lot of those types of questions. 
All I can say is: don't buy the 'official' Oracle book. Tons of errors.
Just give him the damn answer. Nobody cares about "effort" anymore.
Just commenting to say that I miss gridworld. That was a fun part of APCS. I'm glad that is still part of the curriculum :)
Commenting to find in future :) awesome advice!
I took an intro to programming course ny sophomore year of high school, let me tell you how much of a BS course it turned out to be. Of course, I had learned java by this time and the teacher used to work at IBM on mainframes...
Java is awful. But there's a fair argument to say all object oriented languages are awful (including ruby) We use it because its popular and accomplishes tasks. Not because it's good
Its only the [second](http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/1q46t6/new_to_java_trying_to_accomplish_a_simple_switch/) post in twelve hours to miss that the URL does not mention "script" anywhere...
If you are starting fresh, look at building a modern web app with a restful server side and a single page Javascript UI. There are a number of jvm frameworks to build a restful back end to serve up data (some good options here might be dropwizard, ratpack, spring boot, grails). For the the UI use a JavaScript MV framework (angular looks like the one to beat, but ember, backbone and others are viable) This combo is more in line with the current 'state of the art' 
Same as always, look at his history..
I didn't write any code until I was 18. I am now 21 and moved from Europe to work in Silicon Valley. Your logic is shit. 
&gt;You have tauhgt me more in a few hours than my teacher has all year. This is both awesome and very, very sad. Somehow it seems that when it comes to programming, teachers can get away with being a lot shittier than in other subjects, and it sucks. That said, kudos to you! Thinking literally and abstractly is one of the hardest things in programming, and now that you've gotten the hang of it, you have a major head start over most beginners! Also, I encourage you to look up some online tutorials. If your teacher has failed to properly cover variables by now, an online tutorial will help you more than your teacher ever will.
Sounds like she doesn't know how they work either.
Just pluck away day by day, you'll get there. Think about what you want to do, have a longterm goal planned and that way each new thing you learn you can figure out how to apply it to something. For instance, say you want to make games, you know how to write basic code, and instantiate variables. So make a small program that'll take keyboard commands, only the numbers 1-2. Now you can write a program that'll accept attack commands, or run commands. Just have it print "Attacked" or "Ran", and do nothing more. Save it, move on. Later on you learn random numbers, or you learn while loops. Now you can have an active pokemon-style combat system with crazy varied attacks with really simplistic and easy code. It won't be perfect, but you'll start to see everything a lot clearer. Or if you want to make mobile apps, think about basic apps that you use on a day to day basis and recreate it. Like, take a news aggregator and try and recreate it. Each bit of code you learn you'll be able to integrate into that end-goal, from simple things like creating a basic layout, to making it scroll, to making it scroll and load new content, and so on and so forth.

Awfully hard, but fun once you master it
If you google “java tutorial” and read the first three pages of results chances are that you now know quite a lot about Java. Problem solved! All these “recommend me X” questions only exist for a single purpose: making it possible to shift the blame for failure to the person who recommended X. I won’t be blamed for anybody’s inability to understand anything on the internet.
The “example use cases” you’re talking about are called “tests” and—if done correctly—answer all of the questions you raised. :)
I've been considering switching to IntelliJ IDEA because somebody said that it catches more design errors like calling methods in a constructor. This particular somebody said that it's a good IDE for learning better coding practices, but I've been using eclipse so long that it's hard to justify going through the learning curve again. I've come to know quite a few of these little tricks, but it's taken 2 years of use. Would anybody be willing to comment on whether it's worth the learning curve to switch away from eclipse?
A lot of the classes I TA are low numbered.. This allows me to spend a lot of time asking questions to guide them instead of answering questions directly. Unfortunately, this only works if the students actually pay attention to the guiding process... It's just so frustrating to be asked over and over "when do we use calculus in physics" or something to that effect which I've answered the same student about a bajillion times.

There would be no need for cumbersome getters and setters if java had properties. C# has it, even javascript has it. Java is desperately missing it.
After reading this thread, I hope you are a teacher. Please say you are a teacher. Every student that has an actual thirst for knowledge will thrive under your direction. 
DAYYYYYUUUUUM
Well, it is about it being trivial to me because you should be able to ask a professor without wondering if s/he will be right. On the other hand, you can't necessarily trust all information online if it's a difficult question. (That is, something that is not well understood may have several working models and the online sources are not easy for someone to sort through for that case. That is non-trivial. If it's a trivial question, you won't need to sort through stuff like that, so it is a waste of time to wait to ask the professor.) I think it's okay to ask questions and attend lectures so that you know what important questions to look for.. 
I might not be fully qualified to answer this, because I never liked or used Eclipse for an extended period of time. I used Netbeans a lot for years and switched to IntelliJ after buying the Ultimate license during a sale. If you are used to Eclipse, or any IDE, I don't think it's really worth moving to any other IDE. But of course that will differ for every person. In my personal opinion Eclipse is the worst of the three major Java IDEs. Netbeans and IntelliJ share the top position, because both do some things better than the other. There is no clear winner for me. What I like about IntelliJ is the speed. It's easily the fastest IDE out there. On the other hand the completion suggestions are very often bad and Netbeans is so much better. But after getting used to the speed in IntelliJ I feel like Netbeans is breaking my flow. Also the Maven support in Netbeans is superior by far. In the end it's all about personal preference. All three IDEs are available for free, so no matter how familiar you are with one of them I would always suggest to give the other ones at least a try. Maybe you'll find something you immediately like that makes the move worth it for you.
Just wondering - is the above getting slammed because jokes aren't welcome here, or because people think I'm giving the answer? For those who don't know, it's called the Konami Code, a well-known cheat code for a bunch of very old computer games.

As a teacher... ALL THE UPVOTES!!!!
As did I...what have I become?
your username makes me *very* happy.
&gt; if you're referring to having to use getter and setter methods, you don't really have any idea what encapsulation is... Because properties and the other languages ways of solving the problem is heretical?
Sadly, I'm still a first year university student!
I've had some specials related flip-outs since I've moved to Coventry, like finding out that my housemate's uncle is their guitarist. I'm still trying to get him to organise a jam session at our place :P
I would personally recommend looking into both the Play Framework and Grails. They're very good at getting you up and running fast. 
Oh great, now I hate you...haha. I'm kidding but I am extremely jealous. That's crazy. 
no, but properties isnt always the best way of going about things. sometimes you dont even need them.
How is it compared to the Vancouver campus?
I hope so too. We are a family of geeks really, I met my guy playing NWN online ten years ago. I'm more of a foodie geek now, collecting and using cookbooks and spices to experience different cultures' staple foods. Dinner is never boring:)
If I had a teacher like you, I would have embraced software instead of focusing on purely hardware. Alas, I had much less motivated and impatient college professors that only cared about getting back to their research meetings. 
I have the same problem with format strings. Regex I have done so much in my life that I just remember it. For format strings I have to look at the docs every time.

The good thing about higher education here, I don't know if it's true for other places mind you, is that you can't teach at a level higher than what you're qualified in. So you need to have a masters to teach honours, a phd to teach a masters, etc.
For the first time in almost a year, I miss programming. -Ex-Software Developer

Wait what? While I dislike Java I do love OOP, I think it makes for a clean and maintainable codebase if used right. Though then again, OOP is just a tool and not every problem requires the same tool
Do you currently go to Hoover High School in Alabama?
It sounds like she's working backwards to be honest. It's like having the answer and expecting the class to give the question. You don't learn like that. 
I doubt that we are 4000 in IT and CS (we are lectured together) in total, but our number still justifies using a lecture hall with seats for 670 students for most subjects (math, programming and software development, theoretical bases of information technology). Also, at my university, we are about 22.600 students this year, only combining natural sciences and engineering sciences. We have a whole seperate campus at the outskirts of the city, the humanities have their (slightly smaller) campus in the downtown area. Basically everything that needs a lab is up here, because we need more buildings and more space in general.
Oh god please no
You're awesome! It's not about patience, I think. It's about knowing that the person you are teaching to is trying hard to learn it and make it right. If they do this, I'd be pleased to teach them. However, if they are close-minded, stubborn and bitchy, then I'd get nervous and impatient!
Thanks for the info Madera...
17 golds. I should learn programming and teach it on Reddit, you're practically the federal reserve by now.
What would be a good approach to teach a new concept to someone? To start somewhere in the middle and explain any new concept that comes in(or a keyword in the case of a programming language) or should you start right from the basics. For eg. Say you wanna teach someone programming. You could start all the way down to the binary level and teach them about base systems and build up from there to registers, stacks, heaps etc and show them all the concepts and eventually build up to something like java with its object oriented concepts. Or you could start with java and have a simple hello world example and explain the meaning and significance of the keywords as they come along? The first approach is more structured since they will have a solid foundation to work with but its also quite dry since they won't actually be able to write code and play around with it and be intrigued. Underlying concepts is not something that can be touched but code is something that can be and will pique their interests
We use SIGAR
I like Java better in general. Web services are not as easy as php's CGI interface. PHP is for faster development cycles. Java is for faster application logic. Java + Cassandra 4 Ever! :)
I actually acquired his video series but he tended to ramble a bit...I will give it another shot though. (His voice kinda reminds be of Bruce from family guy haha)
Actually, if there is an ombud's office they usually take complaints about teachers and address it keeping you anonymous. At least, they do at my school.

&gt; if the JEE servers legitimately Please, it's Java EE ;)
&gt; However, the EJB legacy architecture, which the application server license business are built on You are wrong on 2 accounts: 1. EJB in its current form is NOT legacy, but a powerful, modern and very simple POJO bean model. 2. The AS business is NOT built on EJB. It's a VERY long time ago that EJB was the main difference between Tomcat and an AS. The integration of JSF, CDI, Bean Validation, JAX-RS, JMS, JPA, WebSockets, Batch, Concurrency Utils, etc is what things are about these days.
Verb much?
&gt; EJB legacy space will simply dry up, Again, EJB is not legacy. If there's anything legacy it's Spring beans. Legacy Springs Beans! Legacy Spring..
Everything is just a tool.
&gt; new development has concentrated in taking the innovations from other de facto standard projects, rebranding them, and marketing this as progress You mean like Spring stealing the idea of injecting via annotations instead of maintaining their horribly complex and large XML files?
You dont have a say in the matter. You gonna get pregnant and that's final. Now spread your legs.
Actually, PrimeFaces is a component library for JSF (think widgets). It is NOT a JSF implementation. That said, I've used it on a project and like it.
wow. this is the smallest comment i have ever seen with such a large number of upvotes.
Did you see this [link](https://developers.google.com/gdata/articles/eclipse)? I havn't gone through it myself, but it looks like it will help you as far as actually doing things in eclipse goes. 
Aw, thanks!
This made me so happy
For 5 to work, wouldn't the intern/styleguide nazi need the same setting? 
Yeah, it really REALLY does apply in public places. If you record someone with a video camera in a public place you're cool, if you record their audio without their permission you're breaking the law. Doesn't matter where it is. *Edit: I mean record their image in a public place with a video camera or still camera - no audio. There are places where even that's not true, but it's not as common.
You are correct and I should have choosen my words better. The popular JSF implementations are Mojarra and MyFaces.
For programming in general terms, there are two books you need to read, hoover. *The Art of UNIX Programming*, by Eric Raymond. *Thinking Forth*, by Leo Brodie. Both will teach you fundamental principles where programming is concerned, and they will assist you in learning how to think more generally. You can find both of them online.
It's cool, I went to Abertay and I've done that before as well, there's only about 5k students but I said 40k for some obscure reason haha!
Glassfish, J2EE, JSF, some JSP. Most of the technical connection code in common JARs. U.S. Government.
As a graduate of Computer Science, people like you are why students drop. I've seen students fail intro classes because someone fed them the answers and they knew NOTHING about problem solving. What happens when they get into the tests and the class final is that they FAIL. Feeding answers breeds failure. This is why a lot of high-schools in America breed failure.
But is this not a sample of how the internet is useful and has most of the questions answered in different ways... Surely if the teacher told you the solution every time you needed help you would just be learning the points she made instead of maybe learning how to get to the point she has answered.
It's just another naming idiom for setters.
Yeah i don't watch any of the videos but the examples and step by step breakdowns of the programs they write help show you how it all works together.
Well I looked at my old code from when I wrote the program. I think we had to make ours turn left instead of right. Either that or I was a masochist. My turtle constructor has the angle at which the turtle will turn. The turn method set the angle to whatever is passed to it, so if it's not incremented, the turtle wouldn't actually turn. public Turtle(double x0, double y0, double a0) { x = x0; y = y0; angle = a0;} public void turnLeft(double delta) { angle += 180 - delta; } 
Who says she's *just* encouraging students to self-teach? We're only getting one little snapshot of the class. We're more than two months into the school year. It's *possible* that the AP CS teacher has been mailing it in for the entire first quarter, but it's much more likely that she's taught him quite a bit and now she's trying to prod a teenager into showing some initiative.
The dude who attends the class is saying that. I don't get it. He says she refuses to teach the basics and explain the code. That's just flatout wrong. If all she has to do is copypaste some code and say *go understand it on the internet, lazy-ass, it's for your own good*, everyone can do it.
WTF? A claim to insider knowledge can't be treated as a claim to insider knowledge?
This is definitely NOT true where I am from. 
If it's any consolation, you'll see in college that teachers like this–your worst teachers in high school– are actually the reason you're able to survive college coursework, because in their failure at their job they taught you how to be your own teacher. At least that was my experience. 
&gt; This is what I don't get about your argument. You hate lock-in but also hate standardization. Don't you get that those free single vendor solutions are locking you in? The big difference between solutions developed in collaboration by many different user organizations in a true open source manner, and solutions developed by a single license sales entity, and perhaps formally open sourced but without a committer community that could realistically move the project forward to meet new goals when the world around changes, is in whether the interests of the user community and the developers and license sales are severely in conflict, or not. Lock-in is a situation in which a user organization can't reasonably control the costs and required investment of, in this case, a product or technology. Those of us who have been working with vendors tend to notice that this seems to happen appallingly regularly with technologies the vendors claim to be standardized, but not with their user organization developed counterparts. 
Yeah, however, that's for checking preconditions. Assertions are for invariants checking and postconditions, and for internal preconditions.
&gt;He says she refuses to teach the basics and explain the code. That's just flatout wrong. **If** it's true that she's done very little teaching so far this year, that's gross misconduct. Are you seriously convinced that's the case, though? All you're going on is a few sentences from one party. The party in question is still quite young, so he has only a limited ability to see the entire playing field and he also has some blatantly obvious incentives to distort the situation. There are numerous other realistic explanations besides the gross misconduct that's been alleged. 
&gt; We all know what he means when he says JEE but that doesn't make it an officially recognized term. Ok, it is not officially recognized term, but so what? I understand it, you understand it, basically everybody understands it given the context. I don't see a problem. It reminds me when KDE developers suddenly decided that KDE is not KDE, it is KDE SC and KDE is now something different. Some people used KDE in the old meaning and some people got angry about it. IMHO it's fault of the producers (KDE, Oracle), they shouldn't make messy namings and changes in the first place.
Wouldn't that grab Java 7 instead of Java 6?
No worries. I thought it was weird too but no reason to penalize TheSkyNet if the author is posting the same link. 
Once again, even if there is a criminal statute that prohibits it, do you really think any police officer or DA is going to pursue that case, under these factual circumstances? 
I am sure the list does not have all frameworks.
Just as an example, this last weekend, my wife's niece had a pre-calc problem, she couldn't wrap her head around it. After whinging all weekend, I sat down, showed her how to write out the problem in MS Excel, only to be told it had to be presented in a function. *f(x)* I've not done this crap in a decade or more, but one Google-searched website later and I had it written out: f(x)=x15+y2000 tl;dr, hooray for me I'm awesome, everyone f34r my l33t sk11z

It's nice! Much smaller than the Vancouver campus, feels a lot more friendly. I've never been a fan of large towns anyway!
That its "Railsy" might actually turn me away from it, I tried doing rails like 5++ years ago and just couldn't, that's why I ended up using Codeigniter. So its most plausible that I'll go with Spring for Google DevTools (have never seen what DevTools do with Java.)
What inside knowledge? The work of "those who create and maintain the technology" is all out there in the open. Everybody can see which terms they use and which terms they don't use.

Oh I get it now, this is actually really easy when explained haha. Thanks :) One last stupid question... I don't understand the input. K is obviously the 3 in your example, but where are the other numbers supposed to come from? Are they just more args? 
Ok thanks man I'll check them out. I think I'm getting it now, mathmatically at least, but I don't understand where the numbers after K are meant to come from? K = args 0, ok.. so are the rest just more args? 
You can turn off any hint in Netbeans if you want. I find switch more readable when you start having many case statements.
I know you can turn it off but the defaults should represent good coding practices not arbitrary opinions. I was wondering if I am missing something and there is a reason the switch case is superior when there are only two options. I do agree the switch can be more readable when you have a lot of statements.
&gt; The big difference between solutions developed in collaboration by many different user organizations in a true open source manner, Hibernate, Mojarra, MyFaces, Weld, just to name a few ARE developed in a true open source manner. There's a committer community and everyone can become a committer as you can become for any other open source project. Besides open source, those projects also have an open design. With other open source projects a group of committers may negotiate with each other in which direction the project is taken. They may do this in person since they live close, or via a phone call or whatever. For the Java EE projects everybody can join the discussions about the design. Everybody can join an expert group (EG) for free. Just as with becoming a committer (for any open source project) you have to be knowledgeable, but everybody can join. Everybody can also submit design issues. Every Java EE project has a tracker up (mostly JIRA) where you can easily file a spec issue.

I work at a research non profit. Currently I'm using tomcat and jsf with primefaces. But I'm very fortunate to basically be allowed to use whatever I like so long as it gets the job done. 
If I recall correctly, the switch statement for cases like this (or more if/else-if comparisons) has better performance. The JVM simply takes test and iterates through the switches list of comparison values. With if/else-ifs it does the check and returns a value for each comparison, incurring some overhead that the switch bytecode lacks. For your case, it's probably overkill, but it's not necessarily poor form either.

I agree! There's nothing worse than teaching an unwilling student.
This is why assert is so dangerous. 90% of devs will use them incorrectly, especially if they came from a different language. Very few people are like "Man, I really want to do some design-by-contract for my internal private code, it would be great if I could replace some comments about my assumptions with code that only runs with a special flag set!" The risk/reward ratio of asserts being used leans heavily towards just making them against coding conventions for most teams in my opinion.
Thanks a lot for your response, it was very helpful in understanding the objective of the assignment. I have taken your suggestions (I think) and made some changes based off your comment and /u/fearless1333 's comment. Here is what I have now. I am unsure if I put my set methods in the correct location in the code. public class Student { private String name; private double midterm; private double finalExam; public void setName(String studentName) { name = studentName; } public void setMidterm(double midtermGrade){ midtermGrade = midterm; } public void setFinal(double finalGrade){ finalGrade = finalExam; } public Student(String n, double a, double m) { name = n; midterm = a; finalExam = m; } private double finalGrade; public String getName() { return (name + " "); } public double getmidterm() { return (midterm + " "); } { if (midterm &lt; 0) { midterm = 0; System.out.println("The grade is invalid!"); } if (midterm &gt;100) { midterm = 100; System.out.println("The grade is invalid! Grade will be entered as 100."); } else { System.out.println("Midterm grade recorded." + midterm); } public double getfinalExam()} { return (finalExam + " "); } { if (finalExam &lt; 0) { finalExam = 0; System.out.println("The grade is invalid"); } if (finalExam &gt; 100) { finalExam = 100;} System.out.println("The grade is invalid! Grade will be entered as 100."); } else { System.out.println("Final Exam grade recorded." + finalExam); } public double getfinalGrade() { finalGrade = (midterm * .40) + (finalExam * .60); return (finalGrade); } public double showGrades() System.out.println("Name:" + name + "midterm:" + midterm + "Final Exam:" + finalExam); } } }
No problem! Best of luck!

For interest, [Swings in switch/case is only since JDK 7](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/338206/switch-statement-with-strings-in-java); if you're targeting anyone with JDK6, then that won't work. Target JVM version is in your project settings, netbeans only offers that hint if you're using version 7 or higher. [yada yada 6 past EOL, insecure, everyone should stop using it: wake me up when companies actually move to it]
It's both more readable, and performs better, but it will also scale better. If you want to add a new branch, well, no problem. On my personal opinion, it would be clearer if you didn't give test2 a default value and add it as the default case to the switch. I tend to try to only set variables once even in local scopes. Even further, I'd then break this out into a function, and just return each value in the switch. In this way, you can add a nicely named function/docs describing what is going on here... and personally, I think switches with returns are really clean when in their own method. switch(test) { case "B": return "Q"; case "S": return "F"; default: return "X"; } .... I went kind of off course there. Anyways, as already said you can turn it off if you really like the if-else here.
Just as a note, you might also consider protecting both examples against a NPE. if ("B".equals(test)) { test2 = "Q"; } else if ("S".equals(test)) { test2 = "F"; } or if (test == null) { //do something } else { switch (test) { case "B": test2 = "Q"; break; case "S": test2 = "F"; break; } }
Imo the options should be "assert or throw an exception." Whatever you decide to do, DON'T throw an `AssertionError` manually. There's no point. Either use a more appropriate exception class or use the assert statement.
OK, now it would appear that there is something blocking access to the SQL Server port (1434)... Try using "127.0.0.1" as the hostname and see if that works.
I was working on a new version of a program I created when I was a young programmer. The programming used a series of if statements that was around 100 ish long, in the new version I implemented this using a case statement and during debug I noticed it simply jumped to the correct case rather than checking everyone.

You need to clarify if you want an answer, your question is not specific enough.
You seem to be asking two questions: 1) How do I search an array for a number? 2) How do I read user input, so I know what number I'm searching for? Let's start with #2. Are you familiar with java packages? If you've seen any tutorials on java, you have probably seen examples with 'System.out.println' in them. Check the 'System.in' package for something useful to you... 
I would have collapsed frothing at the eyes right at the start, at: &gt; I tried using a switch with motionHandler, but that did not work. It's such a common dead-fish response to so many questions on the internet. "I want to change the tv channel. I tried tile grout but it did not work." Oh you tried one thing that makes no sense, can't be bothered to explain any further, and "it didn't work"? Better give up, eh? x_x

You either can program or you cant and i cannot because i failed C++ class and i cannot make any programs on my own at a set deadline regardless of the language used. What happens typically is that i study from a book, if statements,loops etc.) and at the end of the day i am unable to combine and apply what i hafe learned to make a complete program.
&gt; How can I package application data in a jar file and have it still find it? I assume this is a simple directive in the manifest file, but I'm unsure which. I believe you want the "Class-Path" manifest directive (documented here: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/downman.html ) Class-Path: jar1-name jar2-name directory-name/jar3-name Having just gone through this myself (loaded an XML configuration file from within a .jar file via Web Start) I loaded application-specific data with: String jarFileName = "myfile.dat" String jarFilePath = "com/mycompany/myapp/mymodule/appdata" ClassLoader cl = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader(); InputStream myDataInputStream = cl.getResourceAsStream(jarFilePath + jarFileName); Assuming that your app is able to find / load the jar file(s) in the manifest, and that the jar file contains a folder called com/mycompany/myapp/mymodule/appdata, with the file myfile.dat. This will give you an InputStream. Edit: added manifest directive. Edit: I agree with everything djnattyp said!

Spring literally pales in comparison. &gt;CDI [...] hasn't seen much takeoff Nearly every big job I've been involved with in the UK used CDI. It's absolutely huge.

Was it the thread http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/1hxemv/java_ee_or_spring_framework_rule_3/ (or http://i.imgur.com/8pXigEw.png) where you, henk53 (also at https://twitter.com/henk53) and Red Hat's marketing manager Shane K Johnson tried to convince the world of various things most developers would immediately identify as not supported by easily verified facts?
- Most of the time someone is tempted to throw an AssertionError that there is a more expressive error or exception to choose: for example, InvalidInputException. If one doesn't exist then defining your own would be more expressive. For example, if your program has 0 bananas write an "OutOfBananasException". - What value does AssertionError provide? - I prefer errors in production because they are deterministic. For testing I'd rather write unit tests than rely on assertions.
Not in college, so the normal AP high school coursework I guess?
Yep, giving the option to turn them off wasn't the brightest day.
I'll join in. Public company. We use Glassfish running a Jersey API. All of other stuff is non-JVM at this point (some Go, Python, etc)
Are there any good resources that you'd recommend looking at (ones that are pretty good for getting individuals into programming)? I'd like to get better at this skill, and if your offer is up for anyone, I'd like to PM you with help on stuff I'll try working on.
It's just an abbreviation - take first letters of the words and you have it. EE is already and abbreviation, so the result is JEE. This is just natural ... Tell me that you've never used any abbreviation without being an officially recognized term?
The site, www.codeacademy.com is a great place to start. I recommend starting with the Python programming language, it's really easy to get into but you can do anything you want in Python that you can do in other languages, like Java. After you finish the codeacademy stuff for Python, I recommend [the official python tutorial](http://docs.python.org/3.3/tutorial/). It will be quite similar to the codeacademy stuff, but it's really important to do this! Because, codeacademy shows you the material in an informal sort of way, but the Python tutorial is much more formal about their approach (Although it's still geared towards beginners). This is good, because you'll have an understanding of things from codeacademy, and you can relate it to the more official version of things. Its like teaching someone chemistry for the first time, you might start with "all the objects around us are made of really tiny things that stick together". They might think, "okay, I can understand that." Then, you introduce them to the concept one step further: "Everything, also called *matter*, is made of *molecules*". Now you've introduced them to formal vocabulary and slightly more advanced concepts, but they can still relate it back to the more basic definition, which is something that really helps people understand! Good luck with it, and I hope you stick with it until the end of the tutorials. Feel free to PM me again if you get stuck!
Jersey is my preference. It is fairly easy to get started with and simple to use. https://jersey.java.net/ I Prefer to run Jersey embedded because I don't have to deal with Jetty or another container running externally. If you want to get up and running very fast you can use DropWizard http://dropwizard.codahale.com/ It uses the older version of Jersey but still performs well and can be thrown together very quickly. Another option is the Play Framework http://www.playframework.com/
I am a HUGE fan of [Hello World!](http://www.manning.com/sande/) for an introduction to Python. Don't let the fact that its full of cartoons and targeted at 9 year olds put you off. The author really delivers solid explanations of core programming concepts in an amazingly accessible fashion.
Does Jersey support streams? For example: I start a calculation and the application on the server sends me information about its progress.
I am almost positive it is possible. I have not used it though and can't find a decent link from a quick search.
You don't even need to install anything to play around now... http://tryruby.org/
Are you using the dev build or the public release version?
The public release. NetBeans IDE 7.4 (Build 201310111528) to be exact.
IMO the idea behind the higher level languages is not necessarily to get rid of these "bad" concepts rather than to abstract away concepts and tasks that are difficult and often done incorrectly. So yes in a higher language like Java we still do GOTO and many other "bad" commands, they are just not used directly. Really at the end of the day I am still not sure if this solution makes things less error prone or just gives me a bigger gun to shoot myself with. 
There must be something wrong with the source, as it is pulling an error when I run it. Thanks for the help though. I'm going to try to learn Python and write my own program.
Only throw AssertionError if the program cannot reasonably continue otherwise an IllegalArgumentException or IllegalStateException is a better choice.
Next: how to sneeze.
I prefer to embed my web server in the code itself. This way I push a Jar and just run it. No external server or anything. It is a little confusing to set up embedded. Dropwizard will do it for you. Drop wizard also has all kinds of metrics and helpful packages. However if you don't need any of this there is no reason to use it.
depending on the circumstances, yeah. If they were told that it's off the record, if they were told that the microphone was not on, etc. then, yeah they have a case. If they're standing in a room with a microphone and just assume that it's not turned on, then no...that's their fault. Reasonable man test. Reasonable man sees a microphone and thinks "I should verify that this microphone is not turned on before I say something controversial or offensive." 
There's one of these that I care about much. Curlybrace with one space vs Curlybrace at new line. Braces should line up damn it! Curlybrace with one space if (height &lt; MIN_HEIGHT) { //.. } Curlybrace at new line if (height &lt; MIN_HEIGHT) { //.. } 
I almost went for 3 wolf moon but that seemed too obvious.
Like this: http://datatables.net/ ? You could expose your data as a REST/JSON service, and create a JS application for the UI.
Neither. Write unit tests to ensure the pre-conditions are never violated.
I am not sure that writing your own application container is that most effticient way, when there are more than a handful of containers like tomcat, jboss, etc. out there. Then make a simple web app with a servlet and create post to the servlet that does any sort of calulation, or java process that you want. You could also make a front end ( a simple jsp to display information back you). Just a suggestion, its fairly simple if you are used to writing java. 
Pension management - MS SQL, Tomcat, Spring. The application is converted from a very old framework called [Forte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forte_4GL)
&gt; lmost half our internal projects have moved on to other jvm languages and on web frameworks that those have. Do you mean you use a new language and web framework for every new project that you start? Because, because you can? 
I am shocked by how many people put constants without caps. I have never once encountered that.
I forgot to say, i'm already saving the names of the players to a file. My problem is saving the names, then how much games that name as played and how many victories he/she had. AND then show it in the High Score something like this: Names Most played in a row Most points John 10 games 7 Victories Steve 26 games 26 Victories Name3 XX games XX Victories Something like that for like 5 people..
Spring, Maven, Eclipse. It s a desktop app and for the GUI we are using some commercial Swing libs, but there are some plans to migrate to JavaFx in the long run. Spring MVC for the previous Web projects. Also ADF 11g when Ive used to work as a consultant and time was important. The databses were MySql, Oracle and Sybase. Ive never had the chance to work with Postgres.
Right, the numbers 1-8 are arguments as well. Inside your main method you have access to a String array which you declared as a parameter (public static void main(*String[] args*). So imagine someone calls your function like so: java Summing 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Then your args array will look like this: ["Summing", "3", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8"] The name of the program will always be the first element of the args array (that's just how java does it), and for this assignment args[1] will always be your *k*. To get the rest of the input you can loop through the args array using a loop like this: for(int i = 2; i &lt; args.length; i++){ args[i] //do something here } 
If you want to save it as a readable textfile you coulde use a CSV: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values#Example An other option would be to write all the data in an object and then save the Object: http://www.wikihow.com/Serialize-an-Object-in-Java The positiv part of saving in an object is, that you cant manipulate the saved High Scores.
I'm still a newb at this and i'm trying to keep it simple. Didn't get to Objects yet. Is there a way for me to show the code? I've only learned in class about while/do while/for/if else cycles and some other little things, the rest i'm learning on my own and trying to keep it simple.
Realestate Data Provider - Tomcat, Apache, Hibernate, Tapestry, Spring, Spring Batch, JasperReports, JFreeCharts, PostgreSQL, PostGIS
Thanks for the suggestion, but that's way more than I need. In my particular case, I am not trying to create a data table from structured data. In fact, if I was, there would be ample utilities already available in my current project for this purpose. Rather, I am trying to simply find a convenience utility/jsp tag lib/whatever to simplify the code for emitting a plain HTML table of arbitrary elements. (For our purpose, just suppose that the elements are images, and there can obviously be an arbitrary number).
thanks so much , this is perfect. Time to get coding!
Oh god, really? Here?
What are the specific features you're missing? As for general tips, definitely familiarize yourself with the [keyboard shortcuts.](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/webhelp/keyboard-shortcuts-by-category.html) I learned Java on IntelliJ, so its quirks are what I'm used to.
Was going to mention Oracle ATG, but at second thoughts I decided not too because no one would know what that is. So to reply to OP: E-Commerce: Oracle DB, Oracle ATG, Oracle Endeca, WebLogic.
So now you could save all the data you want in the file(not only the name). Of course you should use a seperator between the different part, like I said before. It's a represantation of a list in a normal text file, called CSV One line could look like: "John;10 games;7 Victories" so you save one of these line for each player edit: you only can use out.println with one string, but you can put two string together like this "name" + ";" + "score"
I don't see any reason why you shouldn't take the Spring [roo](http://docs.spring.io/spring-roo/reference/html/) approach. Install [STS](https://spring.io/tools/sts/all) &amp; have at it.
Please no why oh lord. Please lord oh why no why lord please. You, sir, are either joking or just an arrogant 14-ish year old fucking around on the net. Please no.
I put them on newlines because they are the "new scope" and "close scope" operators and it is far more legible to me (and easier to cognitively process) to have them aligned. Plus, I am a fan of whitespace in code in general. I am not typing code in vi on a green screen across a 300 baud modem anymore. if ( height &lt; MIN_HEIGHT ) { //.. }
Fantastic! You, sir, are a significant representative of the point. Honarary lord of the sub!
You can convert a String to an int and back Integer.parseInt(string); or the other way String.valueOf(int);
I do it that way for Java, new line for c#
LINE WASTER! LINE WASTER!
Didn't know about that, Thank you! =D
This is the problem i'm having, i write everything in consecutive lines and then i can only read and write in order i think. In the High Score file i will have: John 10 7 Steve 26 26 Name3 XX XX but then if Steve plays again and beats his High Score can i just update lines 4/5/6? because now i only know how to update the whole file..

Tab master race
I picture you standing alone in between two furious armies about to battle.
We have fully moved to Grails for Web applications. No longer Java in the strict sense but close enough. Of course more and more is happening in the browser now, we're using AngularJS and our recent applications are just a bunch of REST services on the server side. We're using Tomcat + Postgres when we get to pick and Websphere/Weblogic + Oracle when we have to. Consulting Company in the ISP/Telco environment.
Yeah that works until someone is trying to align all their equals signs together in a nice vertical line or something that isn't on your tab spacing. I actually don't get religious about tabs vs spaces, but I can definitely understand why a coding standard would settle on spaces.
I just write all my code in one long line. 
I'm not sure what vi has to do with white space. Was there some problem in those days or were you just trying to paint the picture? Genuinely curious.
I couldn't help but notice that PHP is conspicuously absent. I guess that's because nobody knows what its conventions are supposed to be.
To a computer, your first input looks like this: 2*\n* That *\n* is a newline character (which is created when you hit enter). However, nextInt() does not remove the *\n* from the input buffer, it stops after it reaches a non-number. So when your program gets to the first nextLine(), the *\n* from your first answer is still there (that is in the input buffer). nextLine() parses the input buffer and takes everything before \n, so your first nextLine() is returning an empty string. The 2nd time nextLine() is called the input buffer is empty so it waits for another *\n* to enter the input buffer. That's an explanation of the behavior but if you just want to get on with the answer, I recommend you change line 9 from int numClasses = sc.nextInt(); to int numClasses = Integer.parseInt(sc.nextLine()); Hope that helps :)
Oh..vi doesn't have anything to do with whitespace specifically; I was painting a picture. There was a time that the fewer keystrokes actually mattered, vi is just incidental (and a side effect, to be honest, with the single-character navigation operations of vi) Not to say nowadays saving keystrokes is meaningless, just that with modern IDEs and the fact that you aren't fixed to 80 characters, have a plethora of good fonts, etc you have some more freedom to favour legibility instead of speed. But I won't like, if I am banging out some quick short script or program, that isn't going to be maintained, I will let myself be sloppy. I also don't get that religious about it because if a project has a style, it's best enforced by code formatters in the IDE and/or at checkin. 
Senior Developer here. "Grid" application servers - Tomcat 6.x (upgrading to 7.x in 2014), JDK 1.6 (1.7 in 2014), RHEL 5x (6.x in 2014), synced via Puppet, load balanced by NetScaler LBs on both internal and external networks. Database servers: Oracle 11gR2 (RAC or Exadata), DB2 UDB on Linux, MSSQL Server. Vendor (COTS) preference - Tomcat 6+ or JBoss EAP 5.x+, Java 1.6+, Oracle or DB2 UDB. For actually writing the applications, alot of focus from the enterprise architects have been around RESTful webservices consumed by ajax listeners in HTML5, although we just finished rolling out IE10 enterprise wide so that was kinda lulz for a bit. Reason for this was that at the time alot of UIs had been done in Adobe Flex and all these services had been built. I tend to ignore this decree. Personally, I tend to use Spring/Struts for MVC, and have started using Hibernate for ORM, but also tend to do straight JDBC DAO patterns (Connection, PreparedStatement, ResultSet) for some quick plumbing stuff that I'll throw away. I think it really depends on what you're attempting to accomplish. Perhaps Java isn't even the right language for the job, or you may start delving into Scala or Groovy. If you're looking for any kind of career advice (you mentioned job postings) I would suggest you hone your skills at 'core' Java, hone your knowledge of Subversion and Git, put your portfolio up on github as both a way to show your skill and to obtain feedback on your style. From a frameworks perspective, I think right now Spring is a good place to start, because they have so many different modules you can pick up and wire in. MVC, security, batch, io, REST, all there. Hibernate will be a close second, since you'll need ways to access data. From a general knowledge perspective, I think you'd be doing yourself a disservice by NOT knowing some basic commands in Linux. How to start and stop services such as Tomcat and JBoss via init scripts, how to set up a JVM to accept a 'kill -3' command to generate heap dumps for object usage analysis. Basic HTTP also comes into play. Your app spitting back 503s or 502s? You can at least start looking at logs and stack traces and finally lines of code. Good luck! 
i never understood people trying to align equal signs either

What's your opinion of http://knockoutjs.com/?
I imagine most people do whatever the default format settings in their IDE are set to. For instance I believe "curly brace with one space" is one such default config in eclipse. I think this info graphic is a bit misleading - it's not like a lot of people are making a conscious decision to format one way over another
Is there a reason for doing this? Excuse my ignorance but it just looks like you're wasting time doing this. 
Learn Spring 3 MVC. Use Spring Security 3.2. Use the newest Spring versions of everything. Make sure to follow this pattern: your Spring MVC controllers should only deal with parameters and call services. All--ALL--the business logic should be in services. All your database-access code should be in DAOs. Make your code fussy clean. 
Personally, I prefer the ternary operator.
I was forced to use ZK. It is super expensive. My company paid for it. I at first thought it was bizarre how the controllers "Composers" held state. It works but the UI is boxy. Acceptable if somebody is paying for the licenses.
They're all using servlets and jsp under the covers.
Google Spring *.pdf. All the Spring books are worth it and you can always get them for free.
Then there's the GNU style, which was the worst of both worlds. if (something) { doSomething(); }

I'm surprised they didn't check the ratio of people who use curly braces for single-statement blocks. I have a feeling I'd be in the &lt;10% of people who don't use them.
Wow thank you so much that worked perfect! So == is more for numbers and .equals is more for strings? I know it is probably a lot more complicated than that though.
== is for primitive data types like int, double, char. Equals is used for comparing objects, which string is. You can distuingish these two pretty easily: Evere objects offers methods (e.g. .toString()), primitive types offer no methods
need to read this through later
This should really go away. IDE defaults should change. Keeping lines to 80 chars really reduces readability.
One more thing, by convention in Java variables start with a lowercase letter, so please rename your variables "Name" and "Age" to "name" and "age". Class names start with uppercase, so to a seasoned Java developer "Name" and "Age" will look like classes.

Or, you can adopt a fluent style, and use braces on their own line when it makes sense (e.g. in your first couple of examples) and on the same line when it's unnecessary (e.g. a function signature). There is no rulebook that says you have to adopt a rigid brace style, and since there are pragmatic arguments in favor of both, why not (consistently) use whatever suits the particular code you're writing?
Because then you can have 2 windows next to each other. This is especially useful when diffing 2 files or a file and a previous commit.
with 80 chars you can more easily have 2 files open next to each other.
That would be interesting metric to see. I find not using scopes around single statement blocks to lend itself very much to developers making mistakes when reading and maintaining the code. i.e. to me it's simply more practical and consistent to use scopes everywhere, since it leads to no ambiguity and mitigates a lazy developer reading the code wrong. However I don't mind constructs like: if ( foo ) { bar; } where the scope open and close are on the same line, which is probably heresy.
Haha I'm still very new. This was my first night learning java. I had tried once before for a couple days but got overwhelmed but I decided to start again. Hopefully I'll understand it soon enough, but I still get so confused with all the terms like object and classes and how you make them work. Also I find it's not too easy to make exe files so I don't understand how people make so much stuff out of java without using command prompt to open them? 
Is Kristler the Unidan of Java? I've read a couple of his awesome posts, including the bestof that frontpaged yesterday, and I can definitely say I wish he had been my Java teacher. Good man.
They should also extend the width of books. Make the pages 1 foot wide each, because the current width of books reduces readability.
How about when it is literally impossible to reach that line of code? Do you "assert false"?
Bad analogy. It is more like a book that only has text in the middle third of the page. Why not use the rest of it?
I don't understand your question. If it's impossible to reach a line of code how would you put anything there, including `assert false`? If you're talking about a program being in a state that it should never be in, then you can either `assert` that the variables are *not* in a bad state, or you can check for a bad state and throw whatever exception (like `IllegalStateException` or `IllegalArgumentException` or some exception subclass) that describes the problem. The real point is `AssertionError` is *designed* to be thrown by an `assert` statement. If someone runs your code without assertions turned on and still gets an `AssertionError` it'll be surprising. To me it feels like a misuse of the class.
Throwing `AssertionError` seems misleading since it's not being caused by an `assert` statement. If you want to reuse it anyway obviously there's nothing to stop you. I would use a different exception class or use an `assert` statement.
Long lines are difficult to read. It's hard for your eye to follow the end of a 500-character-long line to the beginning of the next, agreed? How about 400 characters, or 300? An 80 character width is easy to follow. Most books, if I'm picturing them correctly, have even less than that. That was the point of the analogy. That said, 80 isn't a magic number. I wrote a sarcastic response without even knowing what you think a good width is. Sorry. :(
Can you clarify what you mean by "safe"?
You remind me of a colleague who thinks one should never throw a NullPointerException manually -- that NPEs should only be thrown by the runtime. Totally reasonable, but you're setting yourself up for disappointment! Too many other Java programmers (including the JDK authors) don't see it your way.
If foo and bar really are that short, I don't see anything wrong with this.
Yes of course that's exactly what I meant. In fact we use a random framework for every single project, and even parts of the same project JUST to make it more interesting. Of course not.
This would be incredible. Please update /r/java if you ever find something like this.
Or configure your security manager better. 
I've been using Mule for 6 months, I don't think it brings any real benefit to the table other than making trivial tasks easy to express (like "monitor this directory, when a new file comes start this process, then archive the file"). You can either program in XML, where there is a magic "payload" object which gets passed along automatically (think of it like a giant global variable), and the most useful thing you can do is transforming the content of this payload object and send it to another process. Or you need to do some **real** work, and then you resort to write the exact same Java classes that you'd have written if you haven't used Mule in the first place. I've found the documentation confusing and in some places just a little better than a practical joke. The single advantage of Mule in our project is that it has led us to move some data interchange functions out of ATG, and by developing APIs it will allow us some day to migrate to another ESB product.
Man I wish I had this course when I was in hs...good luck man
I already was working in IT when Java came out. i was working for the austrian distributor of Sun. At that time there was a lot of talk about how Java got its name. Ot turned out that the Sun people tried a lot of different names in their meetings but in the end nobody could remember how they got the name Java. Unfortunately not the most exciting story, but you should be able to find the corresponding background story on the web. 
One of the unit tests took 152 ms when it should have taken 150 ms.
That was my initial thought but the project says there should be one array. 
Well, I know of one company where they do exactly that! :X I did some consultancy for them and I still keep in touch with some of the developers there. They use Java, C++, Ruby, Perl, C# and PHP. For just the Java code they started a big rewrite to JSF and Seam, then all of a sudden they felt JSF wasn't cool anymore and they started all their new pages for the same app in GWT. When GWT wasn't the thing anymore a couple of pages were build using Play, and the latest is that all things are now build using Angular :X Oh, and even for JSF they have parts of the app using RichFaces, and another part using IceFaces. They deploy to Tomcat + Spring, as well to JBoss where they use EJB and CDI, and for some reason the Play pages run on GlassFish using the deploy as war support from Play if I'm not mistaken. And then there's the databases. They use MS Sql Server (multiple versions), MySQL, and PostGres, and for no other reason seemingly than "because we can" they have Hadoop, SOLR, Mongo and an amount of other NoSQL/Big Data things running in combination with them, Worst thing of all? I probably didn't mention everything they have running. Is it a super big company with 100's of diversified teams? Nope.. it's ~40 developers for a ~150/200 person company. I kid you not :X
An array is an actual Object.
To add: An array can hold primitive types (int, float, long, double...) while an ArrayList can only hold objects. For example you can declare an ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; but not ArrayList&lt;int&gt;. If you add an int to an ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; the int will be autoboxed into an Integer.
There are no native dynamic arrays in Java, the ArrayList class is the standard implementation of the dynamic array in the Java Standard Library. 
I'm curious about your experience with Endeca, we tried it but the installer refused to work and after a week of frustration we simply stopped trying. How does it work? Is it a resource hog?
An Array is a fixed size data type. It holds value of a specified primitive data type. An ArrayList implements the List interface. Other variants of Lists exists as well. The difference here is that the ArrayList is backed by the Array datatype. When the array backing is some percent full it is doubled in size by creating a new array. The List interface provides a myriad of useful methods such as AddAll which inserts all entries from another collection into the list. It provides a some contains methods and a lot more. They can be seen [here](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/List.html).
Since you're going the integer route, try using constants to increase code readability and reduce the chance that you accidentally enter the wrong number in your conditions. public static final int ROCK = 1, PAPER = 2, SCISSORS = 3; Also try using some nesting to increase code readability, like so: if (r == ROCK) { if (in.equalsIgnoreCase("rock")) { System.out.println("Draw!"); } // If cases for paper and scissors vs. rock should go here. } if (r == PAPER) { // Handle player input vs paper. } // Handle player input vs. scissors. I would consider using switch statements as well, although they may not be the best option since you only have 3x3 cases. Also, try to split your code up into small methods that do one thing well. This makes it much easier for testing and debugging, which you'll get to in the future if you continue programming. **Always remember to separate UI code from application logic.** It's best to start with good habits! Hope that helps.
&gt; Or do you mean the open-source community surrounding it with all the frameworks built on Java technology? Yes. Plus the commercial companies that build the tools. In the case of Javascript, I lived through the age and I know precisely how/why mainstream libraries/tools like jquery, node.js, express, mootools, backbone came into being. I didn't have the chance to have such experiences with Java. Thanks to you, I know how/why Apache-commons exists. But there are a lot of other open-source/commercial libraries/tools that I wish to know about. [this image](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/0707_barcia/0707_barcia_images/figure1a.gif), though incomplete, is the closest to what I am really looking for. If somebody asked me the same question about javascript, I would begin by explaining them how Java and JavaScript are not the same, about the name, then about ajax, jquery leading upto node.js, express, socket libraries etc. If somebody asks me about UNIX, I'll begin with bell labs and narrate towards a modern distribution like Ubuntu through the GNU project etc. I know it's not a fair comparison. I realize Java ecosystem has a more elaborate and complicated history that. But I really hope to get a nice story from here.
