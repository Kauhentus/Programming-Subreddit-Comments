I don't suppose the "imaginary representation" is `BigDecimal`?
I am not quite sure, but maybe you can try to delete the last line in your .txt file and instead of using that "EOF", try checking for while(inFile.hasNext()); If you start with nSodas = -1; and then increment (nSodas++) at the start of the loop instead of the end you don't even have to decrement it later. The overall loop would look like this: do { inFile.nextLine(); nSodas++; sodas[nSodas] = new SodaPop(); sodas[nSodas].name = inFile.next(); sodas[nSodas].calories = inFile.nextInt(); sodas[nSodas].sugar = inFile.nextInt(); sodas[nSodas].caffeine = inFile.nextInt(); } while(inFile.hasNext()); **Be sure to check if there is at least a first line to eliminate a possible error there
Don't apply. Post your resume on a job board such as monster or dice and have recruiters come to you. There's a lot of demand out there, if you post your resume, they will contact you.
Cute.
This would have been more appropriate as the title
Their is a general acceptance that programmers should shy away from UX designing as most of us don't know shit. But I had UX classes as part of my Software Engineering degree at university and absolutely loved it. The thing is, programmers tend to have a "how hard can it be?" attitude at first. Then they completely fuck it up and think its something incredibly hard to do. It isn't hard though, just different.
This. is. genius.
Looking through the source code of `Double#valueOf(String)` and there are no `BigDecimal`: http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/openjdk/8-b132/java/lang/Double.java#Double.valueOf%28java.lang.String%29
&gt;For some reason I continue to get an error involving the amount returned for change owed in four cases Please provide either what error message you are getting or the input, the printed output, and the desired output
This code is for the Amplify MOOC program for AP Computer Science. When I run the code, it simply says (paraphrasing here): "Your code has passed 16 of our 20 tests. Your errors are as follows: 1. (Any of those cases I mentioned in my post); Incorrect: change owed" And it will repeat it for all the cases.

(Any of those cases I mentioned in my post); Incorrect: change owed" And it will repeat it for all the cases. The thing is that the website tests random numbers, so I can't give you an exact value that gives an error.
Instead of `System.out.println("Change owed: " + change);` try `System.out.printf("Change owed: %.2f%n",change);` Is printing the change formatted to two decimal places a requirement?
As someone who doesn't know much of anything about UX/UI design, can you recommend some books to get started? Currently I have a copy of [Designing Interfaces](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596008031.do), but that's it.
Yes it is
Then can I just surround "100 * paid" in parentheses and cast it as an integer?
[Xuggler](http://www.xuggle.com/xuggler/) might help, but I don't have first-hand experience with it because I've only used the JMF (which sucks, btw). Alternatively, maybe JavaFX has something you could use. Media and 3D graphics have never been Java's strong points, unfortunately, but at least there are a few really nice 3D Java frameworks out there. 
I'm not sure what you mean by "the data". It's not really that the fields are ignored, as much as it is the identifiers are ambiguous and we need a way to disambiguate them. It's kind of a chicken-and-egg scenario: We use `this.field` instead of just `field` because the compiler assumes we mean the parameter, and the compiler assumes we mean the parameter because if we meant the field we would have used `this.field`. As for "the fields are set up and then the constructor runs", that's getting into object initialization order, which I can explain, but it's not really the same question.
That's correct. And apply the same logic to cost.
Interestingly, setMillisFixed doesn't appear in Java 8 date time, which is strange because it takes a lot of the other great concepts. From a little searching I found that you are supposed to inject a "clock" object into the class that needs current time, which acts like a factory. You can then inject a frozen clock. It's less convenient but lower coupling.
You declared String soort, int leeftijd, and String Geslacht in main(). Use them as instance variables in the Kip class, and wrap them in getters/setters. Otherwise, those three variables will only be associated with main() and class objecttest, not Kip. 
Okay thanks man. If you're wondering about the strange words like "leeftijd" the're dutch words.
This is the full code. 
I figured as much (though I assumed German... whoops). Variable names aren't important so long as they're meaningful and not random horrible names like "carl." 
don't ever call the dutch language german, i dare you!
Thanks!
I understand I need to work on my understanding of constructors but I am not seeing where it needs to be put without affecting what I already have.
Yeah, but how can I go about fixing this. I'm at a standstill with this right now, I know my mistake isn't in the if/else statements but monthNumber and name.
Again, you are ***.
The only way it could be different is on different platforms, and if you are launching on different platforms and care about precision, then you should be using strictfp. Ugh I forgot my actual answer, sort of fell asleep as I answered that last night. OP, if you have computations that require perfect accuracy, use the BigDecimal class. Also /r/javahelp is specific to java questions, and would be perfect for this! The JIT would not change the return values, that would be a very shitty JIT if it did.
I'm sorry! I'm a stupid American bastard who only knows Spanish and Hebrew :( 
 public void read() { Scanner stdin = new Scanner(System.in); length = stdin.nextInt(); int[] score = new int[length]; String[] name = new String[length]; for(int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++) { score[i] = stdin.nextInt(); name[i] = stdin.next(); } }
this is what I got for my read method. I fell like there is something wrong with my scope variables.
Thanks for taking a look! Feedback appreciated :D
&gt; The JIT would not change the return values, that would be a very shitty JIT if it did. That would limit the JIT extremely when it comes to floating point. Just moving float values around can cut of the native precision, so eliminating unnecessary moves/loads/stores or modifying them to fit the access patterns better would not be possible ( iirc that is, I am not exactly a processor expert). I couldn't find any mention of changing behavior at runtime, so the JIT may be conservative in that regard.
This is correct. Your arrays currently have a local scope inside the method. Declare them as fields in the class instead (or pass them from read to print). Also remember to only instanciate them once (call upon new). Your print method is just making new, empty arrays with the same names as before. 
JIT changing program behaviour is a bug, just as it is with any optimizer. It could change the value of the variable if it makes sure that it will never be used past a certain precision, but I don't think that is a worthwhile optimization, so Hotspot probably doesn't do that.
Thank you!
A tip, you should always compare doubles to within a certain precision anyway because of the inaccuracies in floating points. Though yes, as others have said, parseDouble should return the same value for the same string. You can always look at the source code to verify it. 
The latest release includes support for real user monitoring
Sorry, you're completely right. Here is my code; import javax.swing.JOptionPane; public class homework2 { public static void main(String[] args) { String numberOne = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Please enter the charge for the meal"); double number1 = Double.parseDouble(numberOne); double a =0.09, b = .15; double sum1 = (number1 * a); double sum2 = (number1 * b); double sum3 = (number1 + sum1 + sum2); JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "charge for the meal is " + number1 + "\nTotal is " + sum3); } //main() As you see there I have a to be 0.09 but in the equation it uses 0.9 instead. Thank you! 
So the best I can see this is going from something that is obvious shit to something that looks like iTunes. The nice way of putting that for the future is: Find out what does what you want to do (or close to what you want to do) and copy and adapt.
cheers for pointing out, it would be great setMillisFixed is also in Java 8. I will take a look at "clock" &gt; gly, setMillisFixed doesn't appear in Java 8 date time, which is strange because it takes a lot of the other great concepts. &gt; From a little searching I found that you are supposed to inject a "clock" object into the class that needs current time, which acts like a factory. You can then inject a frozen clock. It's less convenient but lower coupling. 
 Return x%2 +y%2 ==1; 
You wouldn't recommend using the singleton pattern for anything else concerning unit testing, so why are dates any different? For example, what if your logging framework also uses JodaTime? It wouldn't be ideal for your log statements to be jumping all over time. 
extend JDialog and override the paintComponent method with one that loads in your image.
*This is not a solution but a posting recommendation.* While seeking information, please make sure that the title reflects this (just adding a question mark is often enough). I came here looking for the same information that you are looking for only to realize this is just a question and not a solution.
This is a maths question rather than Java
Yes, java allows itself to rearrange operations as long as the results are not affected... Except for float and double. Use strictfp if that's not OK.
Everything asides from `MultiSphere` and `main()` should be inside `Sphere`. Then `MultiSphere` should have a `main()` method which has multiple `Sphere`.
You've got all the info you need to write this, but not what to write. Hit google and find out how to calculate the volume and surface area of a sphere based on diameter or radius. It's not a complicated formula. You could translate it to code pretty easily. As for what to put where, what would make the most sense? In object oriented programming, what's the point of a class? Would it be better, for example, for a Sphere class to be able to calculate it's own surface area, or for a manager class to calculate the surface area of multiple sphere objects? From a design standpoint, which would work better now AND in the future. That is, if you later have to make a shape drawing program, where would it be better to get the data about a sphere? I know you want direct answers, but you likely won't get them from a programming community. A big part if the career is doing this kind of requirements development and parsing. Code isn't really just code. It's design, breaking down vague tasks, looking up things you don't know how to do, etc. Read the assignment again carefully. It's laid out in a clear order. You can do this.
So I should have something like this in MultiSphere? Sphere1(); Sphere2(); Sphere3();
I know where you're coming from with the no direct answers thing, haha. I'm still really shaky on objects and exactly what their function is in Java, so I'm having difficulty just trying to decipher the problem by itself. I don't really understand what it wants me to do with each class and what getter/setter methods are.
No, What you want depends on what is meant by "*updates several Sphere objects.*" Either you'll want nothing but `main()`, or you'll probably want a List/Array of `Sphere`s and some other methods to update them appropriately.
The operative concept here is "scope". The variables are defined within each if/else block; that means that they are in scope only within the context of that block. When you get to line 68, you are in a context in which those variables have not been defined--they are not in scope. You would need to declare them before the if/else statements. Then inside those blocks, you would only assign them, not declare them.
Bingo.
How about: if(item instanceof Square) { ((Square) item).howToColor(); }
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt; &lt;title&gt;Insert title here&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;center&gt;Mileage Issues&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; answer = prompt("Please enter the number of miles traveled per gallon of gas that your car consumes (i.e. MPG)."); answer2 = prompt("Please enter where you would like to travel (in miles)."); answer3 = prompt("Please enter the current price per gallon of gas (in dollars)."); document.write("Your car gets "); document.write(answer); document.write(" miles per gallon.&lt;br&gt;"); document.write("Gas currently costs $") document.write(answer3); document.write(".&lt;br&gt;") document.write("To travel "); document.write(answer2); document.write(" miles, it will cost you $"); document.write( (answer2/answer)*answer3 ); document.write(".&lt;br&gt;") answer4 = (answer3 + 0.25); document.write("But if gas costs 25 cents more per gallon, it will cost you $"); document.write( (answer2/answer)*answer4 ); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/html&gt; Struggling with the last part. When it calculates what the cost would be for the trip if gas was 25cents a gallon more I get the $NaN. Ideas?
Does `GeometricObject` declare `howToColor`? Is `howToColor` extending a superclass method or defining one on it's own? Here's a hint. Put the annotation [@Override](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/predefined.html) on top of `howToColor` in the Square class. See what happens.
That is Javascript, not Java
That's very odd. I have little experience in JS, but I don't see any reason why that code shouldn't work. I don't know what to tell you about the NaN, but this MIGHT work: If you know how/want to learn, try making a function that takes the parameters: - the gas price per gallon, - your miles per gallon, and - the distance you've gone then returns the total cost based on those parameters. That would be a better way to do this anyway. Then call that function twice, first using answer3 as the gas price, then with answer + .25 as the price. Also, that formatting is incredibly difficult to read.
Arrays are not a dynamic data structure. Meaning they can't alter their size after declaration. That means that the size of an array has to be declared at the instantiation
Thanks! I knew it was probably this, but when I tried to fix it I made an error. I was attempting to declare them without giving them a value. I've declared them outside with a value now and they're working!
There are some sites where you can edit the same text live, but it's not an ID, and the name escapes me right now. Eclipse has some arcane function in the ECF, but I think the best solution for you might be TeamViewer...
Real time coding is a very bad idea. Imaging you need to test the code but it doesn't compile because one of your friends is also working on it. Use a versioning system instead. The most popular one is got, and you can host your project on github. 
Note that you also want to fix the timezone. Wouldn't it suck if your tests broke just because someone meddled with the machine's timezone?
This is what i like to do when i have some experiment at hands, i write them on that javarepl. Is nice that, at the end, we are gonna be provided with a better one http://www.javaworld.com/article/2601433/java-language/programmers-could-get-repl-in-official-java.html
You don't really program live, but for practical purposes, this is what source control is for. Check out github if you haven't. 
As a mod of /r/Javahelp, you have my upvote. I am subscribed to both and also would like to see the [Help wanted] posts moved over to /r/Javahelp. /r/Java should be left for language specific discussions and discussions of new/improved features/frameworks, etc.
Have you ever considered we can't do anything without you giving us the errors? 
Full ack, also thank you for providing your time to modding /r/JavaHelp.
I agree with you. I am one who does read the text in the sidebar, so I think it's important to put correct stuff there.
Yay!
This alone will probably work as well as a link in the side bar. However it may help in showing a clear line between acceptable and unacceptable use so that when we ask folks to take their cries for help to /r/javahelp, we have somewhere to point to.
I agree.
Perhaps even go further and limit the scope of /r/java to "news and discussion related to JAVA"?
Why did you miss the link in the sidebar? Would modifying the sidebar help; and if so what modification would you deem productive?
I'd rather use Guava's [Splitter](http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/common/base/Splitter.html).
Would you like to join the mod team and help keep the place running? 
Since you mod at /r/JavaHelp, would you be interested in helping out here as well?
YAY
There's plenty of help in /r/javahelp. What I like about it is that we generally try to help people learn what they are doing rather than just doing it for them. Unfortunately that isn't the type of help people want sometimes.
I guess the sidebar could be improved: maybe larger links, a short explanation of what the links are, etc. I agree with the points in your submission, and I already try to steer people over there whenever I can. Unfortunately many of these submissions are one-shot-only, so improving the sidebar, a "rules" page, or something like that is better suited IMO. ^The ^next ^problem ^to ^tackle ^afterwards ^are ^the ^spam ^submissions ^of ^people ^promoting ^their ^product ^or ^blog ^:)
So you think that telling people to delete and repost in /r/javahelp would be beneficial for both them and /r/java (even if they might think differently)?
I'd be glad to help.
Can't promise that I will always have much time (owing to my job), or even that I'll always be available (I sometimes have to travel to areas without internet access), but other than the above reasons I can't see further hindrances. So, the answer is **yes**
Invited. 
Accepted ;)
Accepted.
Yea (that's the spelling with regards to oral voting, BTW. Yay means "hooray").
Thanks, I guess. If you have to add something productive to the discussion, feel free to share. :-)
I'm honestly unsure what this is - it is not even blogspam. The linked page embeds a youtube video without adding anything in the realm of content, but there isn't even a single ad on the page. Anyway, please next time post the youtube link directly and add a [video] to the title, ok?
Note that different JVMs / different machines may interpret your String differently – this depends on their floating point implementation.
I think that's fair enough. Although I'm still a student and I don't understand much of the advanced Java stuff, I actually appreciate the discussions here in /r/java regarding latest Java technologies, algorithm implementations, interesting opinions, and just plain java stuff.
Done.
Well, the mods have invited me to join (so: yay!), and having accepted I am now starting to implement it. As with all mods, my time is limited, so please everyone resume telling help-seekers to go to /r/javahelp.
Thanks!
Good for you. If I'm doing it right, you can a) continue to do so if you are interested in java folks helping each other out or b) enjoy more news and informative posts about java on /r/java. Or both.
AND MY AXE!
Did you get it working?
That's fair. However, SwingWorker is designed for a result, and this example doesn't use one; I'd say you're looking at six of one, half a dozen of the other when it comes to which you prefer. Use what works.
I'm not in favor. I feel like when people have real questions, being redirected to another sub is just discouraging. The people stuck on their homework will post there, but someone who is just trying to learn for its own sake may not be so persistent. I think having it on the sidebar is good, but it isn't as if this subreddit is overwhelmed with "how do I write a loop? I don't get it," posts. So I don't see the point in removing them. I like that this is a community open to people of all levels of development and I think that creating arbitrary "no asking for help" rules is an unnecessary barrier to entry to newbies interested in the java community. 
I disagree - sometimes text posts can be genuinely useful, and not only for meta-discussions like this one. Thus to forbid them completely would reduce the usefulness of /r/java without necessarily increasing the signal/noise ratio.
On it.
You may want to try /r/learnjava. Note that this isn't about exclusion, it's about separating news/discussion from help/learning so that those who want one, but not the others can have it without interference. I guess it's an example of the "good fences make good neighbors" adage.
|good fences make good neighbors http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2010/05/sarah-palin-misinterprets-robert-frost/57248/ I think you may have misunderstood the poem.
Thanks!
I agree. I mean, SO is for a specific type of question and that format works really well. How weird if they would also allow you to post news articles instead of asking a question. I don't know what the idea of this subred is anymore. Is this a place for people who can't find SO? Or is it for people who's questions were closed at SO for being too localized, not providing enough info, provoking discussion, etc. Or is this for posting news? Or is it really for both? 
But does it look inviting to Java professionals if the majority of posts here is about questions that are so basic that you just wonder if people actually make an effort? SO is a bit better equipped to deal with those, as they have an eleborate moderating system specifically designed for handling questions. Reddit of course has a moderator system too and has votes just like SO, but the moderator tools are too general (I'm moderator over at /r/javaserverfaces, so I know what tools there are). 
&gt;"separating news/discussion from help/learning" is exclusion. Look, in this world, the majority of folks come here to find news and interesting technical articles. They don't necessarily want to help students with their homework or show other clueless folks "the codes". Note that there are still those willing to both learn and help (I for one count myself into both categories). For those we have /r/javahelp and /r/learnjava, and even /r/javatil. &gt;Why not start a separate community "EliteJava" or "JavaNews" and separate yourselves, rather than fragmenting this one? Because we already have the aforementioned subreddits, each with an active community. &gt;I've been a "java professional" for a decade now. Welcoming of newbies is not the same as being one. So you think everyone who wants to learn about java is a newbie? Java as a language and ecosystem is a moving target (even if not a particularly fast one), so many of us stay learning lest we become java-ex-professionals. Your proposal, if executed would amount to reducing /r/java to another /r/javahelp while a potential /r/javanews would probably take the place of /r/java for those in the know. Note that some people looking at the java community will also look here to see an example of what the java community is like. As a professional, I'd rather have them see a place with interesting news and vibrant technical discussion (with links to a place where everyone can ask questions and a place to learn) than seeing a bunch of 'homewrk halp plz?' posts.
Would be easier if Reddit has a move post/question option like SO has...
As I commented above, the best thing would be having the possibility to move a question. The old link would disappear from the list in /r/java, but people with the link would be redirected to the new location.
I think we should just comment and politely ask them to move the question to /r/javahelp and then downvote it so it doesn't show up at the top of the feed.
Yeah. As it stands we can ask OP to repost before removing.
Full ack.
I'm not clear what you think I'm proposing we do. I don't see us as under seige with "homewrk halp" posts. I'm not proposing we disband /r/javahelp and direct those people here. I think that community serves a purpose and is great. I simply also think that we should be welcoming, here, to people with questions, as we always have been in the past. Further, I think that you shouldn't be so defensive that someone has a dissenting view. This is not an issue where someone is right and someone is wrong. I disagree with your proposal. I have explained why I disagree. You're not going to "prove me wrong" because there is nothing to prove. I like this community the way it is. You don't. I think it's contingent upon you to make your own community rather than push people out of this one. You don't. You're a mod now, so I guess you win. But feel free to continue talking down to me about how right you are.
|Look, in this world, the majority of folks come here to find news and interesting technical articles. They don't necessarily want to help students with their homework or show other clueless folks "the codes". With 61 replies out of 33,000 subscribers, I don't think you have the data to make that claim. However, the dazzling degree of condescension toward the beginner suggests that your goal for this community is to become the kind of insular elitist clique that I want no part of. We should be welcoming to people who want to learn Java not sneering at them about "the codes," and strutting around like peacocks about how much skilled and experienced we are.
I would consider a REST backend in Java and a UI frontend in Javascript (Angular, Ember.js, Backbone, etc), probably powered off node.js. That is a very common pattern these days.
JSF (2.x)? It's the successor of old JSP technology, and in the JavaEE standard. 
I'm somewhat reluctant to go with a JS framework, unless they explicitly support progressive enhancement? 
When you start talking about two instances of an application, that gets a bit more difficult. These are situations when a server/daemon type application might be necessary. A crude way to handle that would be to use a PID file. When you start your application it checks for a PID file, and that way it can know if there is another instance running. 
what do you mean progressive enhancement?
Honestly, I think this is the wrong move. Java already has a slew of well developed, maintained, and supported JSON libraries. Why do we need this functionality in core java? What does that buy us? What if 10 years down the road we decide that YAML is the way to go or maybe Protobufs? Does java start to absorb all of the different serialization standards? Really, I think java needs to focus less on pushing everything into the standard library and more on pushing things out.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement basically, if you turn javascript off, can users still use your website? 
YAY
Apologies if you construed my comment as 'talking down to you'. This was not my intention. I may sometimes appear aloof especially when posting from my phone and aiming for brevity, as English is not my mother tongue. That I let this whole discussion stand here despite my new mod power (that would include removing it) should show you that I'm not very interested in 'winning' as you define it - far from it. I happen to think that all the java-related subreddits are beneficial to the broader java community, and I also think that this service is enhanced instead of diminished when those subreddits focus on their specific purpose. /r/javahelp was created with the express purpose of helping java folks out. /r/learnjava was created as a place for people wanting to learn about java (no matter their years of experience). Where does that leave /r/java? If you are right, it's a bit of all plus news, blogs and white papers. If I (and the majority of commenters here) are right, the main focus should lie in the plus... part. That does not mean I want newbies to stay away. However, the majority of /r/java *and* /r/javahelp want help seeking post funneled to the latter. This is what I will try to achieve - if possible without being unwelcoming to newbies. If you have suggestions on how to integrate them into the community while keeping the focus, I'll be keen to hear them. Otherwise I will simply try my best for everyone on /r/java - including you.
If you're going to break out into multiple processes, it might be a good idea to use tools suitable for that purpose instead of coming up with an IPC strategy yourself. For example, [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) or [Spring Batch](http://projects.spring.io/spring-batch/). These will allow you to implement Producer/Consumer type configurations on a larger scale. These options support multi-threaded, multi-process and even clustered (multi-machine).
You can still use JSON with third party libraries. I like GSON. 
One of the most important users is search engine bots that crawl your site and index its content. If all your data is rendered via JS, how on earth it supposed to derive any meaning from your site? I'm not saying javascript is bad, I'll definitely be using it in my application, it's just JS should *enhance* your website, not be run by it
Here here! We already use GSON pretty heavily in our applications. We likely wouldn't switch just for the sake of switching because GSON already works for us, and is already a dependency for some of the Google libraries we're otherwise using... So it wouldn't eliminate a dependency from our build anyway. 
Progressive enhancement and making your site crawlable are two different goals. Progressive enhancement is about keeping your site usable without Javascript enabled. For that, you'll need to mix server-side rendering and a library like jQuery. The base page would do normal full-page updates using basic HTML, while the jQuery would enable partial page updates. Getting this to work correctly isn't easy. A site can be crawlable and the UI can still be built on top of JS frameworks. As long as the server is returning HTML templates (at least initially) and the JS framework is building off of that (compiling directives on load), a search engine will still be able to understand the site. You might not want to write a single-page app, but that is not strictly required. This use case is easily met by JS frameworks like Angular and Knockout. Of course, users who disable JS would probably be left out in the cold.
Are you using JAX-RS with Jersey for your REST API? If so, you might be able to just get away with adding the @Template annotation provided by [Jersey MVC Feature](https://jersey.java.net/documentation/latest/mvc.html) For example: @Path("/foo") class MyFooResource { @GET @Template("/fooTemplate") MyFooModel getFoo() { // whatever } } You can use a couple of different templating libraries, or write your own adapter. I would recommend [FreeMarker](http://freemarker.org/) 
But how relevant logging framework log statements are when I'm testing some business logic? One test should only test one thing at a time, if I want to test logging framework I write separate test for it &gt; it suck if your tests broke just because someone meddled with the machine's timezone? 
Ah this is very interesting, my web service is is built on Dropwizard, I didn't even realise it had a views component. 
I'm using Dropwizard for my service, /u/jfurmankiewicz just suggested the views module in Dropwizard achieves the same thing (it uses JAX-RS under the hood) Thanks for this suggestion, I didn't even realise it existed. 
Can you come up with an example? If I freeze a time, how my test would fail if timezone is changed?
google says they are going to be rolling out crawlers that do javascript
Values that are used to calculate cost need to be converted from the default (String) to numeric values. You can convert each variable or even convert the complete expression that calculates the cost. You can test the latter by replacing the following statement: document.write( (answer2/answer)*answer4 ); with document.write(Number((answer2/answer)*answer4)));
Great reply. &gt; A site can be crawlable and the UI can still be built on top of JS frameworks. *As long as the server is returning HTML templates (at least initially)* This is going against the grain of REST backend + client side frontend suggested earlier, you still need an additional server side component that's returning the templates. I agree with you though that this is a more progressive and pragmatic approach. 
I'm sorry, you mean java 1.4??is upgrading java really that hard /risky? 
&gt; Java could be misconstrued to mean an Indonesian island. And Python can be mistaken for a kind of snake, one which might even live on that Indonesian island ;) 
I'm not sure what you have construed as an ad hominem attack. I don't see anything that has attacked you personally. I have criticized your argument and your rhetoric as needlessly condescending, but that is not the same thing as an attack on you personally. I don't know anything about you to attack you. I also don't see what your responses have added to any reasonable discussion. You have characterized this sub as overwhelmed with requests for homework help. A quick survey of the top posts on /r/java shows me only a handful of requests for code help. If there were a deluge of non-users coming here to have us do the work for them, I would possibly agree with your approach. However, that simply isn't the case from what I have seen. Thus, I see it as needlessly divisive.
I'm troubled that you think not removing dissenting opinions constitutes some kind of display of magnanimity on your part. But, I appreciate any offered apology.
Your survey probably missed the posts that were already removed.
Read up on AngularJS (the tutorial is pretty good) and in particular the resource provider. It treats the REST backend more like an API than a UI. The HTML templates can be served up by a regular web server.
inappropriate username.
XML isn't all that bad. And honestly, I think that is one core thing that was done pretty well in Java. It is done sort of like DataSources (Another well designed core thing) where a default interface is created and various drivers exist to implement it. But that being said, I don't think that either have a place in the core language. These are capabilities that can and should be provided by 3rd party libraries. Why would I want a JSON API bound to the glacial release cycle of the Java langauge? Certainly I'm OK the the Java language developers working on a Json library. But why not provide that as yet another 3rd party library? Then they could release it at a different rate and faster. It also makes it possible for them to more easily do breaking changes to the API (Just bump the major version and let people use the previous major version until they are ready to go forward). Being part of the core API means that now any mistake made in the API will have to be support from now until the end of time. Who honestly wants that? Sure, they can deprecate. But once written it will never be removed (see the java Date class).
Modify the text submission page to be very explicit about what is allowed and what isn't allowed, and mercilessly delete content with a message to the submitter about where to post it. You might want to mark this post so that your [m] appears on it.
The [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/web/jsf20-crud.html) site has a good tutorial.
Definitely take a look at Ratpack.io, I've been using it to build micro services and will be deploying a nontrivial app built with it in a few weeks. If its Java8 requirement is a deal breaker or you want to avoid async, take a look at Dropwizard.
I mostly browse reddit on my. Phone so I never look at the sidebar unless I'm specifically trying to 
Try putting the image into the project folder with your system's file browser
I don't bother with progressive enhancement, since any user that disables JS is one that would not be interested in any of my work. Just like I don't support IE 8 aside from basic functionality.
Logging was just an example. I'm not referring to testing logging, I'm referring to the usefulness of the timestamps in the logs from your unit tests. What if your tests are running from a CI server and you wanted to know the time it ran? Obviously you could look at the CI logs, but the test logs are going to be misleading. What if your tests are running in the same JVM as the CI server (unusual, but not impossible), you've now changed the time for the whole server. What if one part of your system had different expectations of the date than another. By using a static singleton date there's no way of injecting different dates to those different systems under test. It's the same arguments against using *any other* static singletons in unit testing, which is fairly universally agreed to be a bad thing. 
Seconded. I've come across Lanterna many times. I want to use it. It doesn't seem to want me.
You can reuse your Access database http://ucanaccess.sourceforge.net/site.html http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/migration/jdbc-migration-1923524.html 
Really, for this purpose, you should be using a map - where the English word is the key and the Spanish word is the value. The simplest variant of a Map would be a `HashMap`. Make a `HashMap` with `String` and `String` as the generic values, and use `HashMap#put(String key, String value)` to set a value, and `HashMap#get(String key)` to retrieve the Spanish word for the English word `key`. If you must use an array/list, no, there is no way I know of to link them in this way.
SoundBlaster, IRQs... talk about a blast from the past!
I have no experience or knowledge of maps, but I guess I ought to gain some. For my translator, the user can put in either English or Spanish and the translator will give its parallel equivalent. Maybe I misunderstand, but it would seem with this HashMap method, it's a one-way relationship. I need every word in each dictionary to be both a key and a value for each other. Make sense? 
You have no curly braces (`{` and `}`) around the body of the `if` and the body of the `else`. To allow you to keep the process running until the number `3` is entered, you (as you said) must use a while loop. Think about it - what condition do you want to keep the application running while it's true? Place that expression in the `while` loop and wrap each body of the `if` and `else` in one of those loops. Make sure the value your checking is accessible to the while loop. I would also like to point out that it is Java convention to make the names of variables with a lowercase start letter. This means changing your variable names to `convertFer`, `convertCel` and so on. Also - reddit formatting tip: put 4 spaces in front of every line to make sure the code is formatted correctly.
Yep, makes sense. If you can use an external library, the very commonly used library Guava provides this functionality in a map implementation called [`BiMap`](http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/common/collect/BiMap.html). When you want to do Spanish -&gt; English translation, just call the `BiMap#inverse()` method, which switches the English word keys to values, and the Spanish word values to keys. If you can't or just don't want to (don't feel forced) use a library, you can create two `HashMap`s for English -&gt; Spanish and Spanish -&gt; English.
For someone who has started learning, shouldn't make difference, at least for some time
The problem with arrays is that you may have problems with the indices not syncing up. Let's say you have your two arrays. String[] english = {"dog", "cat"}; String[] spanish = {"perro", "?"}; You can iterate over the array of `english`, and put the value into the map with its Spanish counter-part. HashMap&lt;String, String&gt; englishToSpanish = new HashMap&lt;&gt;(); for (int i = 0; i &lt; english.length; ++i) { englishToSpanish.put(english[i], spanish[i]); } That places the Spanish equivelent of the English word into the HashMap as the value for the word. Reverse this to get your Spanish -&gt; English map. Now, if you absolutley want to use only arrays, you can make them `List&lt;String&gt;` instead and use `indexOf` to find the position in the English wordlist and then index the Spanish wordlist `spanish.get(english.indexOf(word))` to get your value.
The native Java `HashMap` doesn't provide any way of inverting the map as they do not guarantee value uniqueness. Guava's `BiMap` does however. The dual `HashMap` method works fine. ^^^^^i ^^^^^tried ^^^^^google ^^^^^translate ^^^^^for ^^^^^'cat' ^^^^^but ^^^^^didn't ^^^^^want ^^^^^to ^^^^^trust ^^^^^it ^^^^^and ^^^^^look ^^^^^stupid ^^^^^:P
Are you using java with the play-framework by any chance?
Do note that in the realm of JavaEE (the web stuff), JavaEE 8 is but a dream and there are very few JavaEE 7 app servers (Glassfish, Wildfly, and some of Jetty). Most are still JavaEE 6. So while we (web programmers) may dream of Java 8 and all those beautiful lambdas, we're still waiting for diamond operators, string switches, multi catch and the like to show up in the app servers that we're using in production. Given that JavaSE 7 to JavaEE 7 is about 3-4 years lagging... *maybe* we'll get JavaEE 8 this decade. So while one may say "go with Java 7", if you're looking at the web, the answer is "go with Java 6" docs.
Make a folder in the root of your project, name it something like 'assets'. Then try dragging your files to that folder instead.
I haven't been in the EE realm in a while, so this may be a dumb question, but what if you run a JavaEE container using a Java 8 JRE? Could you then deploy Java 8-based JARs and WARs to it?
Checkout source code and go to tests folder. All the tests are not really tests but little public static void main apps, which you can run and see various functionality and the corresponding code.
Can confirm. Am there. Pythons name is sancha here, if I'm not mistaken. 
It worked! I can show you the whole code (somehow) if you like. I feel like it could somehow be even simpler, but it works nonetheless. And yeah, I can't say I blame you for not trusting Google translate Haha 
I'd suggest learning the basics of JDBC. JPA is a Java EE standard and uses JDBC under the hood. JDBC is easier to understand, however it typically means more boiler-plate code. JPA is an ORM solution that is more like a black box because of the extra layer of abstraction. There are alternatives to JPA too, such as jOOQ. Since you have a working database, you can stick with Access. If your situation demands, then you could move to something like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
As everybody says: read the docs for the version that you'll be using. It looks like you're having trouble picking a version. Here's your basic Java version guide: Want to make huge enterprise applications? Go with 6. (If you're just starting out, this one's *probably* a no) Want to make Apps for Android? Go with 7. (I guess Android is a big perk for new Java devs nowadays) Otherwise go with 8. If you just want to learn, there's no reason why you shouldn't enjoy lambdas in the progress.
Hi folks. I have nothing to add to this discussion (having never used Lanterna before), but a [link](https://code.google.com/p/lanterna/).
There is JSON support in Java EE. Also, I've been in publishing for a while now and at the very beginning I had to use (just a bit of) SGML. When you've tried to parse a DTD that allows omitting the end tags, XML will look like a benevolent god has finally heard your prayers. Also, there is an enormous ecosystem around XML and I strongly believe that for many tasks it is way better suited than JSON. While JSON is much better than XML in other situations. Use the right tool for the job and don't let dogma blind you. With an amazing tool like Oxygen, how can you be scared of XML?
Also, the code shows a nice window, but I cannot exit it. Only killing the Java process from the IDE closes the window.
It's a cool project! I did a youtube search "Laterna Java": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvK7AdhqO3A
JSON will not go away anytime soon, simply because of JavaScript. But imho it is way to late and this should have been in Java 7 not 9. 
I'm thinking about adding a new sticky post and leaving this discussion as it is. Also we are going to edit the submission page to state our wishes on what to post here more clearly.
Nothing here is set in stone. The mods of this place (and yes, it's not only me) conjecture that increasing the focus could help make this subreddit (as well as the related other subreddits) more valuable to the Java community. So far, there has been a number of upvotes for this post, as well as a good number of positive comments, which suggests that a majority of people (though as I said with no particularly high confidence interval) support this change. We are in the process of figuring out how to do this in a way that is both welcoming to newbies and steering the help-wanted/giving resources to /r/javahelp. We are not clear yet about how to integrate /r/learnjava (for now, a link has been added to the sidebar), the discussion is still ongoing. Also I'm not here to win people (as I've stated before, I couldn't care less about persuading anyone of anything), I'm here to learn. Unfortunately, this part of the debate has devolved into meta-discussion and back-and-forth.
you can shape Dropwizard to have anything you want. It is the best thing to happen on Java since Lombok and Lambdas.
What exactly does this mean in the wider context/process?
Bit late to this post, but I've been waiting for some WebSocket features for a while now. 
1. It's the talk author's blog, not mine. So if the talk was interesting, you can see what else she has written. 2. It also includes slides for the talk (though in this specific case they don't have much information without listening). 
I did not see the slides, because I have deactivated flash by default. Anyway, a [video] (or perhaps a [video+slides] tag would have been especially helpful as without the video there is simply no usable content and the domain is not usually connected to video content. Thank you for posting.
Android apps are my end goal for now, so I'll go with 7 for the time being. Thanks for your help.
Sorry, but I won't have a github-link to a wordpress blog. We (the mods) are in the process of reviewing our options to let you folks link to certain wordpress domains. Until then, please refrain from such shenanigans.
Since you stated: &gt;I know the programing concepts.. not the language. a question arises for me: *Does it need to be Java?* Java front ends require quite some infrastructure. You're probably better off looking for web front ends in more web-oriented programming languages like PHP or Ruby (on Rails) which have native connectors for most databases. As a backend database, you can use mostly everything (probably Access is not the best choice, though). As far as I know, Access DBs can be converted to SQL DBs to be used with SQL servers (MySQL, MSSQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle...).
I just started learning Java and found [Head First Java]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0596009208?pc_redir=1411213941&amp;robot_redir=1) very helpful.
I don't see a JSR for a configuration API, this was one of the features I was most looking forward to :/
*Head First Java* is a good book. Also, for more in depth theory on the "why," along with the "how," I recommend [*Thinking in Java*](http://www.mindview.net/Books/TIJ/). It's old, but good. 3rd Edition version is free online and for download, newer version is available if you can/want to pay for it.
* Post to /r/javahelp for this kind of problem please, but read it's posting guidelines * Please properly format your code. It's a mess and unreadable. &gt; i am not sure whats wrong i think i need a while state meant it keeps giving me an error on the else statement Don't expect **any** help if you can't even show us what the problem is that you're having. Forming proper sentences with proper punctuation helps, too. Think about it from our viewpoint: you're just dumping some code and are saying "There's *something* wrong with this, but I don't tell you what and where. Figure it out yourselves and report back". Edit: and please don't keep deleting your posts after you've received an answer like you did in the past. It's a slap in the face for everyone that helped.
So, just to confirm, is /r/javahelp kind of the Java equivalent of something like /r/learnpython?
It was dropped, because Anatole (the lead) wasn't really an EE guy I guess. A lot has been written about it, see https://javaee8.zeef.com/arjan.tijms#block_13146_java-ee-configuration
Literally *just* read that before I came back and saw the orange-red. Really irritating, it makes using Java EE for distributable applications a nightmare. Sure, you can use JNDI, but it's a giant nightmare to tell people configuring your software how to add JNDI bindings into their application server of choice. I really just wanted the ability to publish a list of settings in a descriptor that the container can pick up, present a property editor and allow an administrator to change settings without messing with JNDI bindings or repacking the WAR. For this very reason I've been looking at spring-boot since at least it can use .properties files or command line arguments for configuration.
Use a bi-map, or use a relational database. No one is suggesting you write thousands of case statements. If you don't want the user to tell you what language they are putting in, then use a map with both Spanish and English words as keys. Or use a bi-map and try one direction, and if that fails try the other direction.
The key words here are "After it's compiled". Type checks don't matter after unless you are doing some sort of dynamic type comparison. This is actually consistent with the behavior of a pointer, as post compilation it is just a pointer and has no type associated with it either, you must extract what it's referencing and do typechecks on that. 
&gt; For this very reason I've been looking at spring-boot since at least it can use .properties files or command line arguments for configuration. Then carry on. And, as usual, the Spring tools will be the default solution for any problem EE didn't bother with.
And please, before anyone thinks I'm being lazy, I've tried everything I've been taught to do by the teacher and from the reading that the test is supposed to accurately test us on.
you are missing several ; in line 9 line 17 , there is no declaration for wages. shouldnt line 17 be wages += or = hours * rate ;
There is around 25 % of readers in Javahelp of the Java. Never posted my questions here. Posted in javahelp twice. Once did not get a single answer , second time today a question on JavaFX popup , the sole answer is "Don't learn JavaFX." . 
If that fixes it, then I think so. Honestly we didn't learn this in the first place and he expects us to know this. **EDIT** Removed "profanity"
The same was said about XML. Before there was json support on the web there was XML support. Though XML certainly isn't dead, it has taken somewhat of a backseat to json.
Yes, I've tried compiling, and the errors make no sense to me. Line 7: Syntax error on token "final", float expected Line 9: Syntax error on token "wages", delete this token Line 17: Syntax error on token ":", Expression expected after this token Line 17: Syntax error, insert ":: IdentifierOrNew" to complete ReferenceExpression Line 17: Syntax error, insert ";" to complete Statement
Wouldn't you want to move on to other experiences? 
Eclipse , NetBeans , IntelliJ. I preffer netbeans.
http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkapjava/ Not necessarily fast, but reading this really helped me get the basics down.
For the next time, better post questions like this in /r/Javahelp. Also, please use a proper, descriptive title - "Why isn't this working?" is one of the worst possible titles. Remember: you are asking for help, so do everything in your abilities to formulate a proper post.
http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkapjava/ http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/index.html Both free and online, they're what i used when I started learning Java. I'd suggest the second one since you already know the basics, it's more in-depth and thorough, if harder to read.
Sorry, I was just venting.
Okay, sorry. I just felt rushed because it's due tonight and I have no clue whatsoever on how to fix it.
Have you actually tried googling the error messages? The Oracle documentation would also be beneficial.
Yes, I have tried this, and nothing specific to my problem shows up that helps.
The initial draft of the JSR's composing the Java EE 8 platform were just approved, at this point we will see the owners of these JSR's start accepting input from the community and continue working on developing the specifications. Final drafts are expected to be completed somewhere near the first half of 2016, with the reference implementation of Java EE 8 being available in Q3 2016. tl;dr; We just accepted the specifications that will be included in Java EE 8, there's a year and a half of developing these specifications to go, it won't be ready for use until roughly Q3 2016.
iff you are a student in the US, as far as I can see.
There is no "fastest" way to learn Java, especially not if you don't know another OO language, and especially not in three days. Just use regular tutorials, or a book. /r/learnjava lists many resources, /r/javahelp has a [resource](http://www.reddit.com/r/javahelp/wiki/tutorial_list) and [book](http://www.reddit.com/r/javahelp/wiki/books) list as well. Edit: typo
In Java, everything is organized into Classes. Classes are used as blueprints to create Objects, which is where the real work is done. If I have: class Sandwich { BreadType bread; MeatType meat; Vegetable[] vegetables; } then I can say `new Sandwich()`, and I will have an object with bread, meat, and vegetables. However, none of these have actual values yet, so it will taste like nulls and errors if we try to use it. So: Sandwich blt = new Sandwich(); blt.bread= BreadType.WHEAT; blt.meat = Meat.BACON; blt.vegetables = new Vegetable[2]; blt.vegetables[0] = Vegetable.LETTUCE; blt.vegetables[1] = Vegetable.TOMATO; I could have also said `blt.vegetables = new Vegetable[]{Vegetable.LETTUCE, Vegetable.TOMATO};` and it would have been equivalent. I have now initialized my blt to have actual values, and I can use it. To make initialization safer and easier, we use a constructor: class Sandwich { BreadType bread; MeatType meat; Vegetable[] vegetables; Sandwich(BreadType bt, MeatType mt, Vegetable[] veggies) { this.bread = bt; this.meat = mt; this.vegetables = veggies; } } Now I can say `Sandwich blt = new Sandwich(BreadType.WHEAT, MeatType.BACON, new Vegetable[]{Vegetable.LETTUCE, Vegetable.TOMATO});`. Note that when I construct an object, I *copy from* the class/blueprint to make it, I do NOT modify the class itself. So then I can say `Sandwich ham = new Sandwich(BreadType.WHITE, MeatType.HAM, new Vegetable[]{});`, and both sandwiches will be different and have different ingredients. "bread", "meat", and "vegetables" are known as "fields", and each object (created by the constructor) has its own copies of all the fields. Constructors are kind of like functions, except they always have the same name as the class they construct and they have no return value (among other things). In addition to constructors, we have 2 kinds of functions: static functions, which are associated with the class itself, and non-static (aka "member") functions. Static functions exist on their own and can be used anywhere at any time by any code, but member functions only exist in the context of an object. Just like how objects all get their own copies of a class's fields, objects also get their own copies of member functions. Unfortunately, I don't have time to finish this post. I'll try to come back later, but trying to learn an entire language in 3 days when you don't already have a lot of experience is a tall order.
Or if you have an ISIC card! 
I thought this was an US thing too, but I can see that I am clearly wrong and it's even available in my country. Never heard about it though. Is this card common?
*lol*, there you go ;)
Wow thank you so much for writing that out, that is actually the most well presented bit I've read since starting.
I's pretty easy to get one for a small fee, at least in Germany. Got mine at a travel agency (great discounts abroad!) after proving them that I was inscribed at an University. 
&gt;There is around 25 % of readers in Javahelp of the Java. Never posted my questions here. Yes, improving the quality (and timeliness) of the given help on /r/javahelp should be our next goal once we have established it as the place to seek and give help around java. My hope is that by increasing traffic there, the improvement will come automatically, but perhaps we're not so lucky.
This is a great idea. I don't know why they didn't do this years ago. I used Eclipse for years before I found that all those small annoyances (like no key binding for restarting app servers and having so much window management to do) could be done away with. The big one was the handling of multiple embedded maven projects. Eclipse just couldn't handle that in a sane way.
I absolutely love Project Lombok, and I'll probably continue to use it for a lot of personal projects, but I have to say it was a frustrating extra step to have to go through when setting up a new developer in our environment.
Was just considering buying webstorm, so this is great news!
If it's configuration that goes into your app (as apposed to the container/server itself) you can use DeltaSpike Configuration today. 
I'll take double clicking a jar file once over sifting through thousands of lines of boilerplate...
&gt;I haven't touched EE since v5. What have I been missing? Quite a lot, although far less than if you used it last at 1.4. Java EE 5 was the beginning of a new direction that focused on simplifications and unification of the APIs. This line was continued into EE 6 and EE 7.
Why don't you ask this at StackOverflow?
The problem as with many things is not the people asking questions, it's the people answering them here. No matter how silly the question, people here want to answer it. This keeps the stream of these kinds of questions alive, and frankly you can't blame the people posting them. They get their answer here and that's what counts. So **if** people here indeed want to put a halt to the flood of below average questions, it may be an idea to address the people answering them?
We did but got no replies, but I think we figured it out. I'll delete this post.
How do I do this? 
Wildfly hit the ground running with Java EE 7 pretty quickly, I don't think it'll be much later than Q1 2017 for Wildfly 9.
Great way to get people to use their products. Surely the ultimate goal is to use open source tools like eclipse and update and improve them. 
Looks cool. Has anyone used this for professional projects.
Because 90% of clients have native support for JSON (browser), I think it will not be replaced as fast as XML. 
It still creates mutable code in places where mutability is unnecessary, and Effective Java argues that mutability should be avoided whenever possible. Edit: I stand corrected. Lombok does support value objects, and even builders, which is awesome. My eyes skipped over these when I read the first time. My main point that mutability is not desired is still important, however, so I will not delete this post despite any down votes I receive. 
Thanks, I'll take a look into it. I was previously looking at using Commons Configuration but didn't like the lookup-based approach.
100% of clients that supported AJAX requests supported XML. XML came way before JSON. Json started out as a hack (eval(myJsonString)) that evolved into a safe standard. You just can't guarantee that what is used today will be used tomorrow. There are certainly already contenders for Json already. Yaml for a more readable and compact form of json, Jsonb for binary transit, Protobufs for fast serialization, etc. The list of different marshalling algorithms is limitless and at any time one of them could become the darling of the internet. But again, why does core Java need this? Why can't we rely on the already excellent 3rd party libraries that exist. I see no benefit of including this even if it were done in java 4. Stuff that goes into java core should be stuff that 90% of applications need to use and preferably stuff that can't be done by a 3rd party library.
Arrggh... I'm conflicted on this decision... On one hand, now my friends can finally use the *full* version of IntelliJ. On the other hand, I am a high-schooler that recently bought the student edition of IntelliJ, so now I am sort of regretting my decision :/ On the bright side though, I can probably get free updates now!
If you right click the image in the package explorer and select the "Open With" option you should be able to select the system editor. If that still doesn't work you can manually select the desired program by selecting "Open With-&gt;Other" and you can then either look through the list or browse to the program. (On windows 7 the default photo viewer is C:\Windows\explorer.exe)
Ditto. The documentation has been in a "To Do" state since the project started, as far as I can tell, and the examples are pretty inscrutable. My desire to spend a bunch of time fucking around with it so I can figure it out is high, but lower than my desire to actually get things done.
&gt; It still creates mutable code in places where mutability is unnecessary, and Effective Java argues that mutability should be avoided whenever possible. For value objects I recommend Google AutoValue https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/value
Project Lombok is great!
V8 never had native support for XML (while other browsers had one) so you had to parse the XML manually or use a 3rd party library. This is a huge difference imo, also JSON gives you sane JS objects and not some crazy object tree with tons of undefined values. I will never use this new JSON library either, but at this point there is so much bullshit in the standard library therefore I don't care anymore.
What kind of retard highschooler buys IntelliJ
Nice! That's a step in a better direction. Still doesn't cover all use cases, but better than nothing. 
Yeah. And what about commercial support? In fact, does JBoss EAP support Java EE 7 now?
1. Learn the syntax of your programming language and the core API - http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ 2. Learn object oriented design - [Head First Object-Oriented Analysis and Design](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596008678) 3. Learn design patterns - [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201633612) 4. Pick a platform - Applets, Android, Desktop or a combination. Core Java and design stuff will be the same but basic things like how you draw graphics or play sounds will vary. Usually you end up adding libraries or frameworks on top of Core Java to help you handle game specific things like graphics, sounds, input, etc. Some might be different across the platforms you want to support and others (LibGDX for example) try to be a single framework that supports multiple platforms. 5. Learn your platform/libraries/frameworks. 6. Make "retro" games with bad artwork or learn to also be an artist or how to find/hire an artist. Many game programming books start off at step 4 so you need to do 1-3 before you get into those books. Never get an old book for step 4, the game specific stuff gets out of date too fast. Anything that does 1-4 all at the same time probably isn't worth it. 
Email them if you did this super recent. Their customer support is really good, they may hook you up
Thanks for the suggestion, but I bought the license around December of last year. It is my favorite IDE by far so I guess its worth it to support JetBrains :)

Its helpful (especially for beginners) to write pseudocode (steps your program needs to take, written in plain english as opposed to a programming language). See if you can come up with something that covers all of your programs requirements, then turn it into java. If you come up with a solution in psedocode that works, but struggle to turn it into syntax, id be happy to help, otherwise its best for beginners to learn to think like a programmer. Is there is something specific about this problem you are having trouble understanding?. 
Just for your information: This type of question is better posted in our sister subreddit /r/Javahelp. 
&gt; Wildfly hit the ground running with Java EE 7 pretty quickly Not really Java EE 7 was released 2013-04-05 and WildFly 8 was released 2014-02-11. That's a full 10 months, and thus indeed about a year. But WildFly is an alpha branch (and thus rather buggy), and not a final GA branch, which is called EAP. It will be a while before JBoss goes EAP with Java EE 7. Estimations say mid 2015. If it will release then (nothing is certain) it will indeed be 2 years for JBoss comes out with a reasonably stable Java EE 7 release. 
Yep, I've used it in a couple of professional projects without issue. You just need to remember to tell any new developers coming on to the project (and note it in your project documentation).
Google is already indexing JS. That problem is solved :)
You don't seem too far from a solution. You get the strings and loop through the characters so now you just need to think how you compare two characters and how to save this information as a result. 
The horrible truth is that tere is no official successor for JSP. JSF is not just a template engine but a whole framework with a very special programming model and implications how you can use http. Java EE lacks a modern template engine tough. My favorite would be [Rhytm Engine](http://rythmengine.org/), which is inspired by Microsoft's Razor. 
Check the link in the sidebar it has tons of resources for you on github. 
I have good experiences with JAX-RS/[Jersey](https://jersey.java.net/) and [Rythm Engine](http://rythmengine.org/) for the templates. 
Priority queues can be used for simulations where to simulate everything is too expensive. A stack might be used for storing history incase you want to hit undo. Queues can be used for so many purposes, good over view in spring integration project. You might use a Huffman tree for compression. Best check out data structures and algorithms course on coursera. Generally it's all about performance. 
We use Lombok where I work. It's one of those few things we use that automatically reduces the complexity of both writing AND reading code. &lt;3

I got a **couple** of files per table, which have the same schema ( so using the same parser for all files should work tho! ) The structure looks like this: &lt;entry id = 0000001&gt; &lt;couple of information&gt; &lt;/entry&gt; I think i have to write something on my own, since i have to fill the db with additional data + i have to update from XML-Files. Which parser did you use? I would bet, that user libraries have been made to solve my problem, efficiently.
I used Sax - I wrote a primitive Handler to read the data and do the inserts. As you can see, I had a fairly simple structure, having lots of data as attributes, which made it easier to write the handler. Check this here: http://pastebin.com/mfm8tCxZ (it's very very old code and dirty as hell, but it did the trick)
thank you very much. I think i can copy a few things. 
I was one of the first adopters. We went live into production with an alpha version of Lombok, nearly 3+ years ago. It was already that good back then. Lombok is Java on steroids. It is the first library I add to any new or existing Java project.
Agreed, a LibGDX webGL based approach would be better if there was a desire for playing in a browser and programming in Java. I mostly wanted to point out that Applets are a platform with their own considerations since the OP specifically asked about how to make a game that was similar to an existing Applet based game.
Aahh Lombok. My Bachelor's Thesis is mostly focused on Lombok.. what a memories. :) Personally I really like the project and the idea, however, whenever I am starting a new project I always decide not to use it. May be because I use IntelliJ IDEA and it doesn't support all features of Lombok.
ok
So you have a problem with a specific piece of hardware/software and you figured the reason is the programming language that was used to build a part of the software? Get in line for the next Turing award.
Yes, it includes upgrades to all latest versions for 1 year. It's cheap to renew, too.
I'd recommend to use **STAX**(Streaming API for XML). It is also efficient and the API is easier to use than SAX. Since Java 1.6 it is included in the Java SE. See Oracle docs for more info: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jaxp/stax/index.html
Oh, do its not just upgrades for the current version, 13? If I buy a licence for 13, I can upgrade to 14 for free? 
V8 is not a browser, it is a JavaScript engine. Perhaps we are different pages here. By client I've been referring to web browsers (as I assumed you were when you put "browsers" in parenthesis). For web browsers, the standard object used to make HTTP requests is the XMLHttpRequest object. That object is not part of V8, but is part of chrome and has been for a while (I want to say since the beginning, but I'm not sure of that). That object is not part of the Javascript engine for the same reason the DOM is not part of the javascript engine, it doesn't belong there. I haven't dealt much with NodeJS, but it wouldn't really surprise me to learn it doesn't have xml parsing capabilities built in. NodeJS postdates XMLs falling from grace and as you rightly point out, V8 does have json parsing built into it. This is primarily because the javascript language spec says that all conforming javascript engines must have a global JSON object to do json parsing.
Yep, if you go [here](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/buy/choose_edition.jsp?license=PERSONAL) and click "License Terms" you will see the following: &gt; **Upgrades and technical support** &gt;Personal licenses purchased starting October, 30, 2013, include a 1-year upgrade subscription. The upgrade subscription qualifies for free upgrades to all new IntelliJ IDEA releases and unlimited access to technical support via e-mail. To continue receiving upgrades after that period, you should renew your upgrade subscription. Subscription renewals commence from the expiration of your previous subscription period, regardless of when the subscription renewal is actually purchased.
not true. We use Lombok exclusively with IntelliJ, all the features work fine, except maybe some cutting edge new ones that they are developing. But everything else works great.
Hehe. Thanks llogiq. Clearly you haven't had experience with this application. Have a search for ASDM and java. You will feel the love oozing from your browser. :-)
That's great! Thanks! 
Hmmm. Sounds interesting. So I follow the link. I see the release notes. Ok, sounds like it might be interesting. But what exactly is it? It's not immediately apparent in the release notes. Let's try the ICEpdf link at the very top. Okay. Now I see lots of documentation. Developer's Guide, Release Notes, Example Applications, and more. But nowhere do I see a simple quick description of exactly what it is. ICEpdf is a library which enables you to ensure that all squirrels within a 50 meter radius end up with the same color fur. Other examples: dom4j is an easy to use, open source library for working with XML, XPath and XSLT on the Java platform using the Java Collections Framework and with full support for DOM, SAX and JAXP. c3p0 is an easy-to-use library for augmenting traditional DriverManager-based) JDBC drivers with JNDI-bindable DataSources, including DataSources that implement Connection and Statement Pooling, as described by the jdbc3 spec and jdbc2 std extension. jTDS is an open source 100% pure Java (type 4) JDBC 3.0 driver for Microsoft SQL Server (6.5, 7, 2000, 2005 and 2008) and Sybase (10, 11, 12, 15). 
Not really sure how it compares but I know Android Studio uses jcenter by default. 
&gt; Java EE is developed by the community with the help of industry experts and provides an excellent, mature, open platform solution to cover almost many enterprise needs. Freudian slip? (I actually really like the JavaEE ecosystem)
Pro-tip: If you want people to actually see your project and not their profile page, link to a part of the project they have permission to view such as this: https://github.com/Zahlii/Advanced-Youtube-Downloader/ instead of this: https://github.com/Zahlii/Advanced-Youtube-Downloader/graphs/traffic Deleting this post and reposting it with a usable link would be advisable.

Maybe a short history means it only goes back a very short time? :)
I would use Saxon and process with XSLT 2.0. Saxon also has SQL extension so its very possible your actual java code will be minimal glue code. 
It looks like you will just need to call Jackson to parse the content field within the element recursively. It is the deserializer's job to deserialize everything within elements including the nested Content objects because you are overriding the existing deserialization behavior completely.
&gt; From my understanding, an Entry-Level Software Engineering job is for someone who has just got out of college with their Bacholer's Degree. And a Software Engineer is someone who has been out of college for a while and is experienced with frameworks and real job experience. No, there's just no difference between those terms. If they want specific years of experience, they'll ask for specific level of experience. Even then, job adds are a wish list. And then it's often a wishlist created by people who don't know what they're doing. You basically apply for anything that's even close. What usually happens is companies come up with this stuff, then find that absolutely no one applies who meets all their criteria. Our company had a whole laundry list of things, then hired the guy who was the most likeable and had some coding experience, but not in many of the areas they wanted.
Truely. I ve read the whole day and i think I will use staxbuilder for JDOM2. My docent told me to use JDOM2. He also said something like :"DOM XML Parser wont work?? That sounds logically for me, but please try it first, so you can point out the differences in ur thesis -.-'." Does it make sense to create an JDOM2 object? Its kinda tough to understand everything. Last time i ve created some XML parser, it was as easy as pie.
No, at least not with Tomcat/Glassfish/JBoss. You can run the App Server using any JDK version above the requirement but the Server still won't support the war/jars from a JDK that is not supported. I think there is actually a check that happens by the App Server, not sure how to turn it off and if the deployment would work otherwise. I tried googling but couldn't find anything, my guess is that everything would work just fine until there is one massive crash.
Only version 8 which took a few months to release.
Thank you, is there any reason not to use Bintray/jcenter?
Now all I need to do is propose the new type system that I've always dreamed of. 
This change literally just happened with the release of IntelliJ 13 last year too.
With Maven you have to configure it manually (Maven Central is hard-coded). It's a one time step, and not relevant when you use a binary repository. With the modern build tools or when using binary repository - I don't see any. But I am biased :)
Ah! That explains my confusion. There's a badge on the page with the upgrade that says "starting version 13". I thought this meant that the year of upgrades starts from the release of version 13.
200 mb isn't really that big for an xml file. Most parsers *should* be able to handle files of that size. I know in .net you can use XDocument.Load in Linq to xml and it can handle files well over 200mb. maybe use .net to parse out the xml files and just push all your data into mysql from .net.
What do you mean flashing? What you got there is an infinite loop because you have given the it no breaking condition, so it will never end. It needs a variable to hold a counter (generally an int), a condition that informs the loop when to end (based on the counter), and an incrementer to make sure that the counter changes (so it eventually meets the break condition).
It's an infinte loop. All parts of a for loop are optional. This loop does not have an initializer, continuation condition or increment. Without the continuation condition, the loop will never terminate unless you use the break statement inside the loop.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_pattern
Agreed. A very common pattern. It avoids hard dependencies by passing instances through the constructor. Very useful for unit testing. 
The flashing is likely a side effect of the infinite syream of text

No kidding, I can't believe Java is still making excuses for type erasure.
Strange things can happen. Consider that a key part of the java web world is that of the jsp. The jsp is sent through a program called jspc which is the compiler form jsp ultimately a to a class file. As the [tomcat documentation](http://tomcat.apache.org/whichversion.html) reads: &gt; If the new Java version introduces new language features then the default JSP compiler may not support them immediately. Switching the JSP compiler to javac may enable these new language features to be used in JSPs. So, the change to javac may cause issues with certain things generated by jspc. There is also a bit of fun with libraries... One example of this was when Java 7 updated to jaxb 2.2 while the rest of the EE stack was expecting 2.1. This caused quite a bit of confusion at a previous employer, completely throwing off the estimates for how long it would take to update the backend - which eventually got cancelled ("do we really need to upgrade? or is this just the devs trying to be on the bleeding edge?").
I *really* wish languages would come up with language level support for this pattern. Something like this would be amazing: public class SomeType { public void methodOfSomeType() { doThing(); } public void doThing() { ... } } public class A implements this.instance { SomeType instance; public A(...) { ... } @Override public void methodOfSomeType() { // Overriding the auto-generated method that invokes instance.methodofSomeType } } And if instance is null, so be it. NullPointerException in A.method.
What a nice little orchestrated chat you performed there, very cute. 
In the company i work for is direct downloading of jars prohibited. There is company artifactory pointing to few repositories that i know of (repo1, jboss). I wanted to show gradle to people around but found out that most of the artifacts (artifactory gradle plugin for instance) are published on jcenter. I never investigated what jcenter is, I just noticed that gradle started puting jcenter in the init script lately. Next step was googling what jcenter is. I found few blog articles but nothing really in depth or from independent sources. To get jcenter to the list of repositories that our company takes jars from I will need some convincing. So here I am asking if you know something about it. I am very much wellcome to criticism of jcenter so that I can decide how much I want to push jcenter on my boss. I think that your comment is based on the same frustration that I got when googling information about jcenter. There is not much there.
The description should definitely be more prominent, as you'll lose a huge chunk of users without an obvious description of your product (obvious being at the top of the front page). I did find their description under [ICEpdf -&gt; ICEpdf Developer's Guide -&gt; Introduction to ICEpdf](http://www.icesoft.org/wiki/display/PDF/Introduction+to+ICEpdf) though: &gt; ICEpdf® is a pure Java PDF document rendering and viewing solution. ICEpdf can parse and render documents based on the latest PDF standards (Portable Document Format v1.6/Adobe® Acrobat® 7) with superior rendering accuracy and performance. &gt; ICEpdf is designed to support PDF document viewing within Java applications in a manner not possible with the native Acrobat Reader® application.

[Lombok Delegate](http://projectlombok.org/features/experimental/Delegate.html) has got you covered (yes, it's experimental, but it does work).
You need that in what ? HTML,Swing, JavaFX 
What GUI framework is this for exactly?
Soot can do this for .class or .java files. If you use .class files, you don't need the sources. It's very memory intensive. It can also analyze and rewrite and optimize class files on the fly. I've found support for .jars a little rough, but just unjar them like you'd untar or unzip things There's also AntLR is you want to generate your own parser. This question is super vague though. 
Not so much a history, more like how Java has grown, continues to add new features, enables a community process via OpenJDK and the JCP and so on. 
~~Did you import it?~~ Also, is this a class from the JDK (I'm not familiar with one of this name)? Edit: * /r/javahelp is better suited * Posting the exact error message would have been nice Edit 2: ahh, `a` is the problem, I didn't catch that. As I said, the proper error message would have told us that. You'll need to show more of your code, where does `a` come from? 
Your declarations of 'a' happen out of scope for the instanceof check.
Use a URLClassLoader to load .CLASS files. You may then package a javac to your application to dynamically load .JAVA files.
Neat but why use AWT when you could use JavafX?
Have you considered vert.x? It is much like node.js, but is polyglot, runs on the JVM and fixes the main problems that node has by allowing you to run multiple event loops and communicate between them via an event bus. It relies heavily on Netty for its IO and one of the main contributors is Norman Maurer, who is one of the main contributors to Netty and the author of Netty In Action. http://vertx.io
You can easily do something like that with [AspectJ load-time weaving](http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/doc/released/devguide/ltw.html) edit: What you want is not really reading "java files", To read/parse actual java source files you could use e.g. [javaparser](https://code.google.com/p/javaparser/) To read/process class files you would use something like the [ASM toolkit](http://asm.ow2.org/) which would allow to analyze compiled byte code without actually loading the class (which can be a big performance hit / problem with e.g. database driver classes). What you want is runtime analysis which can be done with AspectJ loadtime weaving. 
I did not do a single project with JavaFX jet. Maybe I'll find the time to switch the UI to use it though. Which will be the advantage I'm getting there, anyways?
Awesome! Thanks! 
I now added full support for FLAC conversion as well as ReplayGain!
And maybe we'll have it by Java 10
Github.com/frostwire/frostwire-desktop has all that and more to learn from a live code base. We have probably worked with every java technology at an advanced level for over 7 years (after forking limewire)
&gt; Vert.x Vart.x seems like interesting option. I found a couple of sources which talk about performance : http://www.cubrid.org/blog/dev-platform/inside-vertx-comparison-with-nodejs/ http://jxcore.com/nodejx-vs-vert-x-vs-node-js-cluster/ Do you know of any other sources?
I am really a big fan of netty and will definitely play around with Vert.x it seems like a great option. I am wondering if Vert.x is small enough to run on a cluster of low end Win 7/XP machines.
Create a Unit Type. A Unit Type is just the vector of powers. A Unit Value is a coefficient and a Unit Type. Any Unit Values can be multiplied or divided -- even if they have different Unit Types. Any Unit Values can be added or subtracted only if they have the same Unit Type. You might create Unit Types like: TIME = { meters ^0, seconds ^1 } DISTANCE = { meters ^1, seconds ^0 } AREA = { meters ^2, seconds ^0 } VELOCITY = { meters ^1, seconds ^-1 } ACCELERATION = { meters ^1, seconds ^-2 } POWER = . . . ENERGY = . . . VOLTAGE = . . . (fundamental unit of electric charge, time, don't remember exactly) CURRENT = . . . ELECTRICAL_RESISTANCE = . . . PRESSURE = { meters ^-2, . . . ., mass ^1 . . . } (like pounds / sq.inch) . . . and all kinds of basic scientific units . . . The problem is that it should be left open ended. You could declare an Enum with every type of unit (as above) that you can imagine. But anyone should be able to create a new Unit Type with their own combination of exponents in the vector of fundamental units. I don't know how you could enforce compile time compatibility of Unit Type other than to require they be the same value from your Enum. (I'm not, off the top of my head, even sure you could enforce that.) What about something along the lines of: interface Pressure implements Distance&lt;P_2&gt;, Mass&lt;P1&gt;; interface Velocity implements Distance&lt;P1&gt;, Time&lt;P_1&gt;; where P1 means power of 1, and P_2 means power of negative 2. These could be separate interfaces of some super-interface for exponents. interface UnitExponent { public int getValue(); } class P1 implements UnitExponent { getValue() { return 1; } } class P_2 implements UnitExponent { getValue() { return -2; } } interface Distance&lt;UnitExponent&gt;; interface Time&lt;UnitExponent&gt;; interface Velocity implements Distance&lt;P1&gt;, Time&lt;P_1&gt;; Now if two scientists independently came up with the exact same vector (let's just say Velocity), even though their interfaces would be named differently, they would be declared the same way (distance ^1, time ^-2 ). So would those two interfaces be assignment compatible? 
Since Java is a language without multi inheritance for classes you have to design the solution with interfaces. You have one interface for the soldier. A second one for the archer, which extends from the soldier interface. A third one for the horsemen, which also extends from the soldier interface. And at last, the one for "Flying Rain of Fire", which extends from both, archer and horsemen interface. Now, you can implement a class for each of the four interfaces.

Err. why ask in /r/java? Java is not Javascript.
We use a tool called dynaTrace that does this.
I'm an idiot. Got to go to the Dashboard (Help-&gt;Dashboard), go to "Extensions" on the bottom of that screen, and add "Gradle Support" and install. I could delete my shame but I'll leave it for the next person that's as dumb as I am!
Why would you ever want to unit test a lamba? It's like asking how to test a private method. You don't. The method reference solution is like solving the private method problem by making the private method public, which is the gateway drug to really bad unit tests. The "cumbersome" example is the right way to do it - test observable behavior, not implementation details.
Right, which is why all solutions of this problem in Java are at least a little ugly. [Default methods](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/defaultmethods.html) in java 8 mitigate this slightly, but it's still a little ugly compared to Mix-ins or just plain multiple inheritance. 
And the FlyingRainOfFire *interface* extend both Archer and Horseman, so that purity can be maintained later if needed. Perhaps if these roles were implemented with the strategy pattern and then delegated to by the individual classes as necessary.
The fun part about this question, as is pointed out in the Case, is not to find the truly perfect solution, but rather to seek insight into the developer's decision making in deriving a "half" solution to an unsolvable problem. public class Soldier {} public interface Archer {} public interface Horseman {} public class ArcherImpl extends Soldier implements Archer {} public class HorsemanImpl extends Soldier implements Horseman {} public FlyingRainOfFire extends Soldier implements Archer, Horseman {}
Is there a reason not to allow multiple inheritance but require explicit override in the case of ambiguity?

What's the long term goal? If you really want deep OS integration then c# is definitely the better decision. However, if you want flexibility or anything else, then I'd say the main reason is to protect yourself from what you don't know about the future needs. Before I got to my company they banked in c# because of Microsoft. Now as we move to the cloud, they're kicking themselves fairly hard as windows servers are much heavier than Linux boxes and most newer hires prefer Linux environments.
Have you guys looked at flash browser mmo's?
Using a Strategy would be overblown in my opinion. As long as the 'dangling' implementation is package-private, and the implementing classes are private static inner classes, the risk of exposing the additional API is pretty minimal.
How about 64 bit for free? Java builds a universal binary you don't have to do anything to take advantage of 64 bit. In .NET if you build under 32 bit you need to make changes for 64 bit.
Better tools. Free IDEs. Longer maintainability. 64 bit for free. 3D support out of the box. Better multi-language support. Java just has a much lower TCO and it's hedge against the decline of Windows as a platform.
LOL. You don't live in the real world I guess. There are plenty of problems with legacy DLLs and COM (which will never go away). Not to mention .NET uses wrappers internally so if there's some 64 bit issues they'll surface in your .NET app. So sure you can delude yourself into thinking that choosing "any cpu" is going to solve your problems but here in the real world that's not the case.
I would not make a technology choice decision until you know more about your project unless the intent of the project is purely to learn a particular technology. I can imagine node, or vert.x, or netty, or jetty, or dropwizard, or go, or D, or play, or scalatra ALL being the right choice depending on the project. So, what network protocol ? Who/What is talking to this server? is this pure HTML, a single part JS app? a mobile device ? Which persistent storage if any (a huge topic in and of itself ) ? How far does it really need to scale ? What is deployment environment ? Single core machine? multi-core ? multi-machine ? Does it need to co-exist with other systems on the same infrastructure ? All that said. I have some options on some of the things above. a) Although I understand the theoretical reasons for async systems like NodeJS, I personally find the programming paradigm of nested callbacks mentally taxing, taking up brain bandwidth better spent on other things (much like wrangling memory used to ). b) if a process is limited to a single thread, then the notion of sharing in-memory data across multiple cores in a single machine is much harder. Is the advantage of async worth this added complexity on the basis of performance ? c) Tools and Libs. Some languages/frameworks have this like crazy, others not so much. This may or may not matter for your system. 
If by fine you mean slowly, with many missing features and no project compatibility then I agree with you.

Going to chip in here and kick this one in the face. I've written a shit ton of software from MFC through VC++ to C# and Java and Java EE on Windows, Linux and commercial Unix platforms. You know what is the least eye gouging pain? Java. The primary reason is that it doesn't involve dealing with Microsoft Volume Licensing, doesn't screw you with an audit and its about gluing a pile of off-the-shelf frameworks together rather than having to reinvent the wheel or buy in a licensed product every time you build something. Plus it works on any platform so your deployment costs can be minimised and has fully stand-alone deployment without any of the CLR's OS-integration crap. Plus there are so few edge cases and pain points (unlike anything windows native) as there are very few mystical black boxes and very little persistent state to poke you in the eye. Regarding inferior IDEs. When VS hits the 3.25Gb 32-bit process memory limit debugging your big enterprise application and shits a brick, you'll be crying for eclipse and the JVM. Same goes when you need to minidump a process to find out why the GC has gone haywire and the process instantly crashes before you can get the state out. JVM = VisualVM. Problem solved. Regarding patching. How many patches are there to the CLR and dependent frameworks shipped over the last two years. Nearly twice as many as JVM patches. Regarding 64 bit, I have no idea what he's on about either. Regarding WPF, it's abysmally horrid to work with. It's verbose, ugly and the rendering pipeline is a nightmare. The threading model is shitty too. As for 3d, OpenGL or nothing and there are lots of nice wrappers for that on any platform so that point is moot. Regarding multi-programming language support: That sounds like a pain in the arse and a poorly architected product. How are your staff fungible? How do you deploy all that? How do you test and QA all that? Windows hasn't declined. In fact it's grown but so has Linux, OSX etc. **All of them** however still host any of our applications (Edit: which is great as my experiences as per my other threads of CentOS screwing the pooch gives us a get out) 
Spot on with this. Similar situation. The core of our product sat on Windows for years. Then Microsoft pulled the plug on COM/VB6/ASP so a port was done to .Net (2.0). Now the whole thing is half way to Java because the .Net framework is incredibly volatile and keeping up with API and framework updates and web platform changes is, to be honest, crippling. Also we got shafted with VL and an audit. ASP.Net vNext (the emperor's even newer clothes) confirmed it was the right decision to walk 
Muhaha! Holywarr! No one is right, everybody are wrong! 
My biggest grudge again .NET is the availability of open source libraries. Working on a large GIS project I had to work with native DLL with wrappers and not being able to go to 64bit because of it. And yes, some parts in .NET are simple wrappers like LDAP/AD. LINQ by the way also sucks. Use LINQ with AD and than use Skip() and Take() -&gt; forcing LINQ to load the entire AD and then perform the Skip and Take using LINQ to Objects, I can tell you that the experience is quite fun when running that code in production for the Dutch government with it 125.000 employees.
I have some issues with some classes in Java regarding there bad API like the Calendar classes but the IO Streams in .NET are the WORST! I like the generics in .NET; it sucks in Java. I liked LINQ in .NET but it had pitfalls (like AD!), Java made it better. Open source community in Java is much larger than .NET. Find me a good library in .NET * that reads and writes PDF, * that is open source, * free, * And is NOT a recompile from Java (so that rules out iTextSharp).
it's not shameful if you own it
I spent 5 years in C# and 5 years in Java, so here is my view: C#: -------------------- - The all-white, all-Republican neighbourhood. - Everyone drives the same car. - Everyone votes for the same party. - Everyone has the same views...on everything. - No one wants to speak about "the other ones"...beyond the Great Wall that surrounds our clean, safe neighbourhood. - you will know one and only one language: C# Java ------- - the funky, crazy, multi-cultural part of town - everyone drives whatever car they want - 100,000 different political parties - no agreement on anything - one million different options for any task - everyone laughs about the people trapped within The Great Wall and their superiority complex. - very possible you will encounter other languages: Python, Ruby, Groovy, Scala, Go, etc somewhere along the way So it depends what you want in your career.

Nice try at promoting your tool, Takipi. 
Fine as someone proud of being white and liberally conservative i'll keep my C#
whatever makes one happy is fine. 
I've never heard of this before, but it sounds interesting! Now, I may be mistaken (if so, someone please correct me), but it sounds like this models an application as a finite state machine (meaning there isn't an infinite amount of states your application can be in), and then looks for potential problems, such as a division by some variable that may have been set to zero (a state) beforehand, even if this was done on a concurrent thread. Another example of a potential problem: two threads need a pair of locks (let's say mutexes) in reverse order. What this thing does is check if there is a state in which the first lock is available, but not the second one, because the other thread might already own that lock. Again, I'm not entirely sure if I'm correct, so take this with a grain of salt. As for the question of what this "model" is that the article speaks of: that is probably the finite state machine itself! 
What the fuck?
You forgot to copy your class definition and imports and package. Also, bro, not to be rude but you didn't have to explain to r/Java what this code is supposed to do. :)
Plumbr does some good stuff like that too! 
I write all sorts of Java and I've never used it for GUI code. ;)
Basically what I'm doing is inputting java projects into the code/tool/etc and I want to output objects out of it based on how often some of the methods were used during runtime
oh I had no idea Eclipse had this, thank you! 
I feel like wiki missed out on adding image assistance: http://imgur.com/500zHmm

JaCoCo is pretty cool.
Recursion is the programming equivalent of mathematical induction; you need to be able to model your problem as a base case plus an inductive step. In other words, you need to be able to express the solution for any particular version of your problem in terms of an assumed-known solution to a simpler version of the problem. So, in your case, you probably want to begin with the simplest version of the game: presumably this is the version that has only one stick (the actual game of Nim has more parameters than that, so I am assuming you've already been constrained in all other ways). Write an algorithm that can correctly solve the problem for the one-stick game. Next, you need to think about how knowing the solution to the one-stick version can help you solve the two-stick version. That is, how you can transform the two-stick version into "something" plus the one-stick version. And, you need to do this in such a way that your "something" will also let you transform the (*k*+1)-stick version into "something" followed by the *k*-stick version. That's your inductive step. At this point, you put it all together. Your final recursive method will look something vaguely like: public class GameOfNim { public static Solution myMethod(int numberOfSticks) { if (numberOfSticks &gt; 1) { do something; temp = myMethod(numberOfSticks -1); do something; return solution; } else { return knownSolutionForOneStick; } } } Don't take that literally at all, it's just a high-level illustration.
Well, that sounds like a profiling framework. I don't know of a specific one to do what you want. Most people recompile hotspot (oracles JVM) modified. The downside is you have to know C. In theory, you could do something with Jikes, in Java, but I don't know much about that. Eclipse has a profiler, but I don't know if you can get useful output as a CSV or something easy to process. 
Can you explain in more detail what you mean by "it jumps out of execution"? Do you mean that an exception is thrown? Or that the debugger suspends execution at a breakpoint? Or that it just stops working with no indication of what is wrong?
thank you so much! so i just need to use what u put above as kind of a lose ball-park guideline?
That code is about as generic as a recursive program can possibly be. You'd be better off starting from scratch rather than modifying mine. I just wanted to show an example of how recursive logic looks in code. The most important thing is to think about how your solution is expressed, think about your base case, and think about how you can model a non-base case in terms of a more basic case (or cases).
Create a node class with leftNode and rightNode members of type node. Implement the comparator interface in your node class. And I don't understand what the second part is asking.
so the turtle class is an extension of the simpleturtle file we're using. we're writing a program to utilize the drawing abilities of the turtle class(es) to draw features of an image. The first part of our assignment is to write a program in a file using code from an appendix to outline the face of a headshot of ourselves named headshot.jpg. This assignment works fine for me. Compiles and run's to completion. The second part of our assignment the program is the write methods in a the turtle class file in our bookclasses folder for the course material to call on in our second program called facefeatures.java. the third part of our assignment is to utilize a file called turtle alphabet to write methods using the letter methods available in the turtle alphabet file to create phrases to overlay over our image. when I compile and run the second and third image, it compiles fine and then when it starts to complete the code to draw all the features and other stuff it just stops at random points along the way. Like it will enter the method to draw a feature and draw half of that feature and then stop before the rest of the other methods are even called. It seems inconsistent with where the program stops, each time I compile/run, even if I haven't made changes or even needed to compile. I'm fairly new to java so I'm not even 100% what an exception is. My professor even seemed stumped by what was going on, but I just noticed that another student was having a similar issue, whom was posting in the class discussion forum. I tried to enter debugging mode and clear any instances of a breakpoint i might have accidently set, but I don't know the first thing about using a debugger so I haven't really messed with breakpoints anywho. 
awesome thanks so much for your insight!
nevermind, me and some classmates actually think we noticed something... the code doesn't show what the turtles done for some reason, until we click and adjust on the window for some reason. so we think it could be an issue with Dr. Java the ide itself, even though of course we could be mistaken. 
So you need to start by creating the Node class. Each node will need a Node leftNode, Node rightNode, and String question. Set the question when you construct each node. private String question; private Node leftNode; private Node rightNode; public Node(String question) { this.question = question; } Then a Node should know how to ask a question. Write up a method that will print the question and wait for input. Assuming the input will always be Y/N or a multiple choice of some sort, write an if statement and else to lead the traversal of your tree. if (answer.equals("Y")) { leftNode.askQuestion(); } else if (answer.equals("N")) { rightNode.askQuestion(); } Then you need to move onto the next node. Call upon the ask question method of either the leftNode or rightNode. **Take note of the recursion here.** Now a node should only try to go its leftNode or rightNode if it has them--if it's not the end of the tree. Before you prompt another node to ask its question, write an if statement to check leftNode and rightNode are not null. If they are null, do whatever you need to do at the end of the tree. You could write a text file and hold the layout of your binary tree in a data representation language like JSON, or generate your binary tree randomly and maybe pull questions from a text file or some sort of data structure in your program. This is where the project may get a bit more complex, but I can help more if you need it. Feel free to PM. I would probably be able to be more helpful than I am writing comments. 
I have seen some posts of you and you don't seen you 'get' a lot. I have been programming in multiple languages and can sum up a lot of positive and negative points. You seem like a guy that just wants to get your point across. You point being that java sucks and. Net rules. Go lurck on /r/dotnet and leave /r/java unless you have something positive to contribute. 
I do this. Designing this is really hard. Best advice I have for you - drink your own champagne. Build your own functionality using this framework. Make sure you are happy with it before you make it public. And make your internal plugin developers work just like an external plugin developer. They don't get full source code access, just the integration library and the docs you provide. Prefer interfaces and injection strategies over extension. Don't make the client extend MySpecialPluginBaseClass; instead allow them to provide a DataTransformer or whatever. Whenever possible, use normal Java. Don't make them interact with MySpiffyDataType when you could just give them a Map&lt;String, String&gt;. If you have a special class that you provide for them to interact with, consider wrapping it with multiple interfaces, and injecting it that way. Give them (DataRetriever)this, (ErrorProcessingEngine)this, and so on. Document all the things the plugin can do, all the API it has access to. Write unit tests to verify that those APIs work and continue to work indefinitely. Figure out a versioning strategy up front. How are you going to support it when you change the plugin interface? "Make all my clients change their code" is not a good plan :-) 
There are certain things like single threaded nature of node.js which turn me off. All the solutions like node.js cluster(Experimental since forever) seem like hackish way to do things. To me running V8 to execute serverside code seems to be using wrong tool for the job. That is the reason why i am leaning more towards more JVM based solutions.
That doesn't sound like a problem with Dr. Java -- rather, it appears to be a failure of your program's graphics buffer. When Java draws to the screen, it does so to a hidden buffer (a technique known as double-buffering) which is then swapped with the current visuals when an update call is received. I have no familiarity with the classes that you are using, but a normal course of action would be to call the `repaint()` method on the display component; however, I assume that these turtle classes that you are using have abstracted these grittier details away from you and their code is in some way poorly written.
Completely new user makes C# versus java trollbait. C# troll start replying immediately in a thread that's only posted in /r/java. What's the matter /u/agusleiva? You didn't get your weekly trolling fix so you decided to start a flamewar yourself this time? 
&gt; So, is JPF basically a very sophisticated debugger that can save the states ( place in execution, data, etc ) of particular program runs.....and compare those runs to other runs? Pretty much. Problems like deadlocks are very hard to replicate in a normal debugger: by setting breakpoints in the code you alter the behaviour of the program and make it less likely that the problem you're looking for occurs (and sometimes makes it more likely you see behaviour that looks like the problem but is just caused by you setting breakpoints). Deadlocks are hard to diagnose and can completely destroy an application. And if such a bug is in a system it really doesn't matter if you have a back up system on your mars rover because it's very likely to run into the same issue. That's why Nasa invests a lot of money making very sophisticated tools to make sure as few rockets blow up as possible.
For those of us who have the luxury of using Java 8... Keep in mind, many companies are still running Java 6
Damn! Now everybody knows!
I had a look but they do not show you the code (the full source code), but just the line number and stack trace. Logstash is just a log aggregator AFAIK, like Airbrake, LogEntries, Splunk, etc. Looks like they also do not show you the parameters passed to the method: https://www.takipi.com/assets/images/206_screenshots.png
There are a number of tools that do this: * AppDynamics * New Relic * CA Introscope * HP Diagnostics
&gt; Will I ever be able to discuss these matters with anyone with at least normal intelligence? Ah, right, people with healthy brains don't use java. Perhaps if you actually could word your opinion without having an aneurysm over the keyboard, and if you'd actually grow up from being the humorous man-child you currently are.
I have marked you as "C# troll" until further notice. You (and everyone else on /r/java) will see it in your flair. You may ask me to remove it once you have proven that you are indeed a developer instead of a mere troll.
Seconded. Also you may want to reuse an existing protocol for plugin integration - see if OSGi fits your bill before you come up with yet another way of doing the same thing.
You operate on the false assumption that I care for your crap. However, I care for this site and there are others you may manage to rile up (which is probably the only thing you manage to do, so I guess you should be proud).
You just keep giving don't you? Thanks you for insulting my intelligence and once again showing the world that you can't debate, or have a grownup conversation. I hope you don't treat women the same as you do your fellow redditors.

I'm starting to get the feeling you came from a Visual Basic background and that we all just should feel sorry for you that you have become such a frustrated scriptkiddy (because you obviously can't code; you need intelligence for that).
We use Netty for the transport layer / RPC framework in our microservice-ish project. Any specific questions?
It's very small / lightweight. My only gripe with it is that they resist you just running it in-process like a library; I prefer doing it that way during development. 
Hmmm... I'll keep an eye out. Thanks!
They did a couple of years ago - where it brought down their servers! I bought a license then. Expecting the same the following year (Dec 2013), I was ready to buy again but they didn't have a sale, instead they announces a new time based licensing model and if I delayed I would have to pay for an outright license, but if renewing within the defined period I could pay the cheaper upgrade. I am expecting to continually pay the cheaper renewal now. Not sure if they introduce a sale again. May be wait if you can.
Don't forget IntelliJ. It is pretty easy to make a plugin for it, and the plugin framework is pretty straightforward.
Just a note: It is almost never a bug in the jvm or ide.
Please do JavaFX.
You can do it in java? I'm surprised.
STOP YELLING AT ME
Am I wrong to downvote purely on the basis of an all cap title in /r/java?
We've done this many times in various applications. There are a lot of factors that have to be considered beyond the plugin framework, which is the easy part. There are application impacts such as: 1. if plugins use your application's API, it must remain stable or else plugins will fail after an upgrade. 2. will plugins just be a UI facade or will they be allowed to change core business logic? If they can change core logic, what are the downstream effects? 3. Will plugins be allowed to extend your data model? This one is pretty hard. 4. Will multiple plugins be allowed to be injected at one point? If so, execution order may be important - how will it be determined? Support is another issue. We have customers and partners writing extensions for our app and they inevitably do something bad and cause very bad behavior. Often they don't consider the issue may be their extension so they file an issue with support. To support a customer with extensions it would be really nice to be able to switch to some sort of diagnostics mode that disables all customer/partner extensions and checks performance and/or behavior. Then if everything is ok you can close the ticket and put the blame on their extension (or help them with their extension). I wish we had this mode, but it's not easy to do in our app. Otherwise you need good logging support around these extension points to be able to quickly identify an extension as the issue. 
Down! Down I say! One down vote for the allcaps. A million more down votes for continuing to promote java on the desktop.
He trolls the C# community [almost as much](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/247pt4/microsoft_is_not_planning_on_investing_in_any/) (just imagine his usual posts in place of the deleted ones), so on that community's behalf I thank you for taking action. I think this is the third account that's he's created and had deleted in less than two weeks.
Is this a serious question? Atlassian by a mile and a half with free cider and donuts at the end.
This would have been useful 10 years ago. Whats next, a Cobol tutorial?
interesting. why not use groovy?
Is [this](https://github.com/jzy3d/jzy3d-api) what you're looking for?
&gt; Whats next, a Cobol tutorial? Yes, but first let's walk through the NetBeans GUI Builder so you can get your enterprise solutions up-and-running fast.
YES - thank you. This is what I was looking at, but I became confused when it mentioned needing the maven module. Have you done imported the jzy3d framework into eclipse? What were the steps you had to take to do it?
You should renegotiate. You've proven yourself and it can never hurt to ask for more. Come up with reasons why you're worth it and present it. I've never done this and not had an offer come back at less than +10%. Contract wage should be 50% more than prevailing market wage for full time with benefits employment. If you're doing senior j2ee in a large city that isn't SF for example, you should expect around 150k or $75/hr. 
Some developers may not want to switch to a dynamic language. (Not that dynamic languages don't have their advantages, and disadvantages.) This seems to be simply a syntax sugar layer hooked into the compiler to make BigDecimal operations easier to write. You still get static type checking along with the advantages (and disadvantages) that brings. But there are valid reasons to choose Java. And Groovy. (aside: I love Groovy as a scripting language in JasperReports. For other dynamic language fun I use Clojure.) 
Scala We're Doing It All Wrong by Paul Phillips https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TS1lpKBMkgg Scala collections fail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiJycy6dFSQ
He's just trolling becasuse he's a jobless C# monkey living in his momma's basement.
Thanks gunch!
This is one of the main reasons I chose c++ over java when I can
So glad to see an intelligent question being asked here.
&gt; Ideally I would like my company I'm being contracted out to, to hire me as a full time employee. Have you asked them about this? I assume they have a for-hire option in the contract. 
Somebody always post this link everytime anybody mentions Scala in here. If you actually watch and understand the video, you'd realize that all those purported weirdness are concessions made in order to be more compatible with Java's semantics. `null` is probably the most evil, but it's necessary to be able to use Java library from Scala. Paul wants Scala to be more pure, more Haskell-like, but most Scala programmers want jobs, and that requires convincing Java-shops to adopt Scala, and that requires Scala to be extremely easy to transition into from Java.
Thanks timdrury. This is really useful information. I appreciate the feedback regarding diagnostics mode. This never crossed my mind, but is a great idea. 
Doesn't excuse you from basic skills.
Thanks robertwilliams. This is good advice. We've done some POC work to see if it will hold water, but a solid, legitimate plugin use case is definitely something we should do. I also like feedback of using generic objects, as I could see things going awry with too many proprietary interfaces. Definitely agree on the documentation, and that will likely be a beast all on its own. Appreciate the response.
oh wow! /test worked Thanks a lot!
http://www.livememe.com/ridapkx
What about junior j2ee in SF? Haven't been on contract since I was an intern roughly 2 years ago. 
Where this frustrates me the most. And is only tangentially related, is not being able to define generic methods on number types. public class Vector2&lt;T&gt; { // GOOD FUCKING LUCK } Makes me sad.
Just use JPA-Hibernate
I'd add that I wouldn't tell your contracting agency that you're wanting to go full time. You're more likely to get a contract raise if you mention that you want to just contract, in my experience (unless the signing bonus is huge, in which case the agency will be pushing for it and you'd know.)
This looks really good, I'll give it a shot, working with bigint and the like is horrible as is, same thing with .compareTo.
Yep. Agreed.
{@inheritDoc} will inherit method documentation from superclasses.
I acutally have not done anything with external frameworks but was curious :P goodluck with your project!
if(intVariable == 15) { // code } "=" is the assignment operator, "==" is for equality, which evaluates to a boolean, which is what the predicate in an if statement needs to be.
&gt; I have tried googling but to no avail Please don't say that when it's obviously not true. Also for future reference: please post these kind of questions in /r/javahelp.
Most contract include something along the lines of, "If you are rehired by the company in any way for 1 year after the contract concludes then it is a continuation of this contract and the agency still gets paid." Certainly any contractor I've spoken to about this has that provision.
This is a valid question.
I think you have it backwards. The Another_class1 class has no idea who is going to use it, so it should not be trying to reference anything from any one of potentially millions of controllers that may or may not use it.
So why are you in /r/java then? :o
But in my case, only the Controller can use Another_class1, this is what the design is all about... I just wanna say "get the comments I've written before in controller". Like @see Controller#foo(), but not getting just a link to the method, I would like to get the text of the comment in that method...
You are really shooting yourselves in the foot here. The people who worked on Scala also worked on Java.
Thanks for the advice, I really appreciate it. I've been getting a bit complacent or comfortable. I'm gonna revise my resume and re-evaluate things. Thanks again.
I like this approach, I think I'm gonna try this.
/r/javahelp or /r/learnprogramming would be better.
IAANAL, and even if I was, I doesn't matter here. Sound advice. However I'm interested in your other comment. Do right to work states forbid contract clauses that would interfere with someone's right to hire me? Linky?
Here's the obvious, probably not helpful, link. It doesn't look like it applies to contractors, and I can't remember why I thought it did. Also, my own state is not a right to work state and I thought it was, so there's obviously a LOT I don't know because IANAL. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-work_law AFAIK, this is a complicated area of the law because this gets mixed in with laws about contractors, and is typically entwined with laws about whether or not the contract can legally limit your employment options with a customer. In short, if the OP complies with the letter of the contract, s/he should be fine, but if they have a question of fairness coupled with the potential chance of a lifetime embroiled with that, then they may want to see a lawyer. 
From the code provided it looks like something is wrong with the userdetailsservice. Also it's better to just use validation instead of checking if a user exists. Another thing is if you are changing so much, must as well use spring and avoid boot. From experience boot is not meant to be Chang too much. Edit: maybe you are creating the user but not setting authentication. Check the database, and use SecurityContextHolder to set the authentication after you create the user.
I'm confused about Oak and Jackrabbit 2. Is Oak a true successor or was the project hijacked by Adobe?
You can, I don't think you need to make any changes to the context configuration file. There should be an application.properties file that externalizes everything. The whole point of boot is that you get everything out of the box, no need for config files.
I'm still not clear on what you are asking. But yes, whatever you are saying sounds possible. Just prompt the user for input when creating a new node and store the result? Is it going to be the same question each time?
I just did the same thing, and you almost have it right. You need to add a class that extends the GlobalAuthenticationConfigurerAdapter (tag it as a configuration file) and there you inject the UserDetailsService. once injected everything works. (Move your last method into that config class). It took me a while to realize that when you new up the Manager, Spring is no longer managing it which means the autowired dependencies arent initialized I included mine int the SecurityConfig at the bottom like this: @Configuration protected static class AuthenticationConfiguration extends GlobalAuthenticationConfigurerAdapter { @Autowired UserDetailsService userDetailsService; @Override public void init(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception { DaoAuthenticationProvider provider = new DaoAuthenticationProvider(); provider.setUserDetailsService(userDetailsService); auth.userDetailsService(userDetailsService); auth.authenticationProvider(provider); } } 
Yeah you can't do this unless you're implementing/overriding the method, meaning that you'd have an *extends* relationship between the two classes. One method that invokes another method have no such relationship and thus the Javadocs are unrelated. You should use an @see in this case (or consider why there is no inheritance).
If the array is (n) long, then the last element (in your case, the highest element) will be at position (n-1). Therefore, you should have `int high = a[length-1]`.
Don't worry if you understand spring, then boot will be much easier. There is a course on udemy.com called spring framework 4 in 5 hours. Check it out, the instructor does everything you are asking in boot. The reason there are few sources is because boot is still new and not many people use in the real world yet. I would link to sources, but on the phone.
because the first element is at position 0. 0,1,2,3 is 4 elements long
The way you initialise several variables on one line is not good practice in Java. Especially because you use some logic to initialise. If you had had them on separate lines it would be more obvious from the line number of the stack trace what was going on. 
/u/Cyndaquazy already gave you the solution, but I would just like to nitpick that you usually don't add a comment about a method ending in Java. If you're interested in knowing why, I can provide a few pointers.
then I gotta copy-paste the same comments 4 times :( thanks anyways... it seemed so logic to me that it could be done...
On short methods like this, I agree with you, but if the {} braces are many lines apart, it helps to get a sense of where you are in the scope hierarchy. Having said that, however, this is an indication that you either love whitespace a lot or your one method is trying to do too much and should be broken up into more manageable pieces.
If you're doing 4x copypasta perhaps your code could use a rework. Some folks around here might pitch in. Although if this is school work maybe this is a topic for class (ha!) discussion.
I was forced to use bluej in highschool and never found any good tutorials for it :/ Is there any reason you are using it?
I have tried BlueJ once to see what is the fuss all about, and can't understand how could anybody use it... Just use IntelliJ or NetBeans - both are really good for beginners.
indentation should be plenty of indication
This isn't really the best sub for this question, but your problem seems to be that forge is missing. Your launcher is supposed to take care of this, but for some reason it is not adding it to the classpath properly. Unless it is just loading the wrong version. What modpacks are you trying to run? EDIT: It's my cakeday!
About a month in we got the teacher to let us use NetBeans, thank god
I don't think I've ever commented at the end of a method in java, but I'm interested; what are the reasons against it?
Happy cakeday :D I can run tppi, bloodnbones, and divine rpg using the latest (recommended) versions. Other packs, such as material science, crash landing and infamy only work if I use an older version of the modpack. At least one modpack, running red, will not load no matter what version I use. My friends can all load the latest versions of these packs no problem. I am using java 7u67, and have uninstalled/reinstalled java, minecraft, forge, and feed the beast. I am absolutely flabbergasted. 
Hmm, so it is not the java 8u20 bug that is really common, and everything is installed correctly. It is possible that those packs are either broken or are configured wrong. They may be trying to use a version of forge that does not have the normal entry point, which is FMLTweaker. I believe the newest versions of forge may have removed FML, and so the entry point is now ForgeTweaker or something similar. The best I can recommend is to contact the authors of the packs and report the errors.
That was my thought, but for whatever reason every other person I've talked to can load the latest versions of each pack without issue. So it cannot be a broken configuration by the mod maker. I wonder if I manually download forge for 1.6.4 and extract it directly to the mod folder, it will work. Let me try that. 
That did not work. :(
Honestly I would just switch to eclipse or NetBeans. It makes work a load easier and doesn't hold your hand to much where your not learning anymore.
Lost_ojibwe is correct, I had to do something similar in my project to provide token auth for my rest services.
Hmm, have you tried manually downloading that version of forge and running it's installer?
Yep, multiple times. This whole thing is like the bermuda triangle it seems. Very mysterious. 
Is there any way that i could "refresh" the class paths that java uses? I have no idea if that is even a thing. For the record I have already force closed java a few times. 
No, the ClassNotFound exception just means that the class does not exist within the loaded VM, which means that either the forge install is bad or the launcher is glitching. In this case it is probably the forge install, which means that either it is not downloading properly or a forge patch was released which changed the name of a class, causing the game to be unable to find it.
I've downloaded both the forge 1.6.4 and forge multipart 1.6.4 and have tried all avenues of installation. Thanks for all of your suggestions. I don't know how this is even a thing. Completely unheard of as far as I can gather. 
&gt; So what can Commander do? It speaks HTTP at scale It's this kind of marketspeak that turns me off to projects. 
I would buy an older edition of the Deitel &amp; Deitel book: Java: How to Program (because it would be an older edition, you can it for dirt cheap, not the $100 a newest edition costs). Then, at the end of every chapter are actual programs you have to write. Very quickly, if you do every single program problem they have, you will be writing a lot of code. Then, this is where you want to go: solve a problem. Invent your own project that solves a problem. In the process of tacking that problem, you will encounter so many issues that you will fix in your brain how to code. 
I felt that way too when i first started, and i found this [website.](http://programmingbydoing.com/) Towards the end it isn't as well made and it doesn't explain things as well as it does at the beginning, but you can learn pretty much all the basics from this website.
I didn't know about this, thanks for posting it! I was looking for a fresh source of practice ideas. 
If you are looking for a good book to read, heads first java will do well to teach you syntax and has some focus on projects inside of it. Tag that along with Head first design patterns, and you should have a couple of good books to show you some intro to java and development overall.
thanks, just kinda a habit, still learning so it helps me keep track of what is going on while I am working on a certain portion of code.
wooooowww.....wow. Thanks lol. one of those things I should have definitely been able to figure out on my own, kinda ashamed lol. thanks though!
Thanks. I'll bookmark it.
This might be [useful](http://alvinalexander.com/apple/mac/java-mac-native-look/)
Yes, I've had a good look at this guide and it is indeed very comprehensive. However: * Parts of it are old and outdated * The author does some weird things in the code (particularly in the event handling section, that's actually what prompted me to do my own research and write my own article) * There is minimal explanation of what is happening behind the scenes * The examples are very case specific and there aren't many of them My goal was to write a comprehensive guide that aced all those points

As fun as self posts are as a distribution method, I think a jar would probably be a better way of doing it. 
Thanks, will do!
I would love to see a minimal java app that summarizes everything you plan to talk about. Working code is always the best explanation.
I learned Java by myself back in I think 1999 when the 3rd Edition of these books came out. They are great and a solid foundation if you do every single problem at the end of the chapter. They have increasing difficulty and if you do them all, they prepare you.
Next time use gist.github.com
Thanks will do
You're absolutely right. I'm gonna do it. 
Yep, a Clock is the right solution to this in general. Using static state for testability sucks.
This post is a good example of what drives women out of STEM fields.
Use a [Handler](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Handler.html) to post a delayed runnable that calls your method.
Excuse me?
Standard forge. Don't even bother with the forge forms. LexManos is a right proper asshole.
Try emptying the launcher cache
It's a miracle that we can even develop "hello, world" in Java for OSX, considering the retarded language that platform's APIs are all in.
Objective-C? I have no experience with it. What's so bad about it?
It's bizarre and incomprehensible. While that isn't a problem in itself, the fact that the platform requires its use certainly is.
Fucking smalltalk.
It's not really relevant to my submission but I'm still happy to gain some perspective on something I'm not really familiar with. Is that a bad thing?
The objective-c syntax is based off smalltalk, which in my opinion makes it needlessly complicated both to read or develop.
Oh god, I thought you were rudely criticizing me for attempting to develop small talk with /u/argv_minus_one... Whoops! But yeah, one of the things that's been putting me off getting into Obj-C is the weird looking syntax.
Added a section on notification center. As per my suspicions it's impossible without some external library.
This is the book you need, and I know that for sure: [Intro to Java Programming, Comprehensive Version \(10th Edition\) ](http://www.amazon.com/Intro-Programming-Comprehensive-Version-Edition/dp/0133761312/) Believe me, this is what you are asking for 
It's a good example of what drives programmers of any gender out of the field. I'd run screaming if I inherited code like that at work. 
Assuming that you have some cash to spend Virtual Pair programmers has a very nice series of video lectures. https://www.virtualpairprogrammers.com/ I've used several of these myself to get up to speed. If you are a complete novice and in a metro area I'd check out the offerings of the local community colleges. I live in the St. Louis area and St. Louis Community College has several campuses that offer Java 101 and 102 classes. 
what about android support?
Meh
True, you shouldn't do it yourself though. I've been working with Spring and there are some filters that throw NullPointerExceptions to the Views. It can be extremely frustrating to debug, to say the least.
because when i cant
Have you tried Swift? It's new and fancy :)
What is the Exception that gets thrown by Objects.requireNonNull when it is being passed null?
Hey no problem, glad to be of help! Also a protip here: One helpful way to debug your code is to explain what your code is doing *out loud*. When you have to verbalize what your code is doing, it forces you to look at the code a different way, and sometimes find your bug. I've had lots of times when I was asking someone a question about my code, only to solve the bug as I was talking :) 
Very practical! I've been using Swing to make apps for quite a few years now. Without any further work these apps look and feel at least "pretty good" on OS X. Adding all the capabilities I outline in my article is pretty trivial, you just gotta do it right. My goal with the article is to outline the "correct way". 
So you mean the event gets fired when someone tries to open a file in Finder with your app? I suppose that means there's a way to associate your app with a certain file extension? I'll look into this. Thanks for the tip! I also just found out that OpenJDK does actually include [inline JavaDocs for com.apple.eawt](http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~michaelm/7113349/7u4/2/jdk7u-osx/new/src/macosx/classes/com/apple/eawt/). Over the next few days I'll be reading through them and adding/editing the article. I might even generate the HTML JavaDocs and upload them so everyone can easily use them.
Like /u/narrowtux said, there's no JVM on vanilla iOS. A while ago I did look up getting Java on a jailbroken device and I found that someone (I think it was Saurik himself) did actually import some form of the JVM and put it on Cydia, however I never got as far as properly using it. http://iphoneroot.com/tutorial-install-java-on-the-iphone/ https://blogs.oracle.com/hinkmond/entry/why_did_saurik_jailbreak_his
Does anyone know whether DCEVM will be integrated into GraalVM? 
You should check out [RoboVM](http://www.robovm.org/), it allows you to run Java based applications on iOS by compiling the Java bytecode to native code - pretty cool stuff!
I think so. Not sure how you would select a jar in the file open with dialog anyway 
I would love it if they just moved it to GitHub. If it's good enough for the Linux kernel, I am pretty sure it could handle OpenJDK. 
For those that want to learn about Graal, Truffle and the SubstrateVM (AOT native code compiler) https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/Graal/Publications+and+Presentations
**SOLVED** **Issue was resolved by moving the install directory out of my user directory and into C:\FTB**
Right. I'll look into it. Thanks again!
While I agree with you, this is Apple that we're talking about. They develop closed systems, that's their thing. The reason they succeed though is because their systems are polished and complete. You buy into their system and you basically have whatever you need/want. The nature of both Obj-C and Swift is to develop apps for their systems. In essence they're not like other languages for that reason. Regarding Java bindings, I don't think that has to come from us. Oracle should update com.apple.eawt to include more bindings for OS X features that came out since 2011.
This is the path that libgdx takes to build ios packages from a java games framework. Seriously cool.
Actually, I found a way to customize the icon. Instead of executing the command through java, you have to create an Applescript file with the command inside. [Then, make that Applescript file have a custom icon](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH10847). Then execute that Applescript file through java, and the Notification icon should be the Applescript file's custom icon. EDIT: disregard this. It seems to only work in early versions...
Aww, seemed very promising. I'll see if I can figure something out.
Capitalization according to conventions, proper usage of try-catch, reasonably-sized methods. I'm a little impressed. On the other hand: no Factories or Builders. No Injection. No lombok. Not even guava? 8/10
That's awesome! I feel like dancing and coding :)
I would love for Oracle to make an announcement stating that they and Google have set aside their differences and are now working together for the greater good. 
Thank you! 
Where is the source code for the classes, and in particular is `methodCall` declared static?
Your second block is using a static method (though you're using a static method in both, you're just not calling it statically in the first example). Static method invocations use the class loader's instance of the Class object for your particular class.
That code is terrible. The first time you try to use that object, you'll get the NPE automatically so you don't need to write any code at all and it will throw that. Writing code to throw a different exception is just as bad. There is no problems with an NPE. It tells you the exact problem. Hiding it in a different exception makes it harder to determine the problem. 
What were the differences?
Agreed. Unfortunately bad examples are plenty. Having spent the weekend writing a IE extension using C++ BHO. I know the pain developers have to go through to write extensions if you have significant market share. Compared to that Chrome makes it really fun to write extensions by exposing a bunch clearly defined API's(you can take a look at their API documentation).
Serious question, I'm not trying to troll, but why would anyone in the community spend time learning or using something licensed under the OTN license? Doesn't it run the risk they will abruptly discontinue it or make you pay high fees to use it in production?
Never mind. I dug more and see that the source is GPL but the release is OTN. seems odd, but as long as I can get the source under a free license I'm good
Oracle is trying to make the Java library API proprietary.
Give us a bit more information, please. Are you trying to do a full date/time conversion, or is it just hours and minutes? Do you have the hours as the "whole part" and the minutes/seconds as the fraction?
Catchy
They tried back in 2010 (that's was a why google reinvent the wheel with Android API) but AFIK oracle stopped trolling. Do you have any recent source ?
Thanks :-) I took a look at lombok and guava, but I think I'm going to try and make sure I have a solid understanding of basic Java before I start worrying about them. Thanks for mentioning them, though. I hadn't run into them yet. As I said, I only started learning Java a few months ago.
Please post such questions to /r/javahelp.
The reason is many business won't touch GPL so they dual license it.
http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/9/5699958/federal-court-overturns-google-v-oracle
It looked even more awesome on the big screens in the Moscone with the sound turned up......
There are many sites like [Codingbat(for beginners)](http://codingbat.com/java), [talentbuddy (more algorithmic stuff, not exactly Java-only but a good site to just programm things)](http://www.talentbuddy.co/) and many more. Just google for Learning by doing sites etc. Eventually, you will maybe want something like [topcoder](http://www.topcoder.com/), that is more challenge oriented
Yeah, I think it was a joke. Guava is a library for for doing lots of small stuff that becomes a hassle after a while, injection is for specifying and creating objects, and factories give you instances of objects. These are all enterprise-y things you'd want if you were, say, making a backend server for Google. Anyway, congratulations!
Not sure how up to date is the feature list [1], but it still seems to not support "val" feature as well as some others. Anyway, it improved quite a lot since I last looked at it, might give it a try next time. [1] https://code.google.com/p/lombok-intellij-plugin/wiki/FeatureList
That's the very nature of software. I don't see any problem with that, if something better comes in the future, just move on.
Should work fine as the code is written in pure Java only and requires no external libraries.
a lot of bugs, not recommended.
Possibly because there were doubts about it to be released at all yet. https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=445064 
Delete the private static final long serialVersionUID. It should give you a warning by the class name, and if you hover your mouse over it, it should give you the option to generate the ID.
I use my project folders. I use it for clojure projects with no probs.
&gt; Calculate and display the addition table for a number input by the user from 0 to 20 adding the numbers 0 to 10. For example, if 3 is the input then the output would be: 3+0=3 3+1=4 3+2=5 3+3=6 ... 3+6=9 3+7=10 3+8=11 3+9=12 3+10=13 This simple exercise is frequently used in introduction books regardless of the language. I don't mean to sound harsh, but if your book isn't teaching you how to solve this, then you need to find a new book. Edit: Also checkout /r/javahelp and /r/learnprogramming
Might also want to have a look at /r/doyourownhomework.
It'd be extremely helpful if I could get a write up of these programs to see how they're written.
I'll try and find a new book, it had good reviews though :/.
Could be, if last week release was the exception. But since a few years they're always released completely silent. From the same blog, the year before “Concierge Creation Review Scheduled” and “Web-based BPM with Stardust” were way more important to put on the homepage than even the tiniest snippet about the new Eclipse release.
Hey, glad it was useful :-)
All the more reason for me to pick this up and ditch gamemaker. Nothing could be worse than GML. 
No word on mobile support. So it seems they will keep pushing for the lame *Oracle Mobile Application Framework*, and leave the field open to the likes of C++ and C#.
As I understand it, robovm is capable of emitting machine code generated from Java Bytecode. so if you can get the machine code to work with Windows Phones native API (if they have one?) then it could work. Actually I think windows phone uses some weird IL and then does some weird internet compilation??? Also RoboVM provides wrappers for Cocoa, so you would need that too for Windows Phone APIs :D
Just use - Xmx4g on the command line.
Assholes will be assholes. Everything is a trade off. EE is big and complicated (because it solves a lot of complex problems) and has a bad reputation back from when it was all XML and configuration. This is not the case now but a lot of people haven't got over it. The whole container's suck business is silly when you think that a container is just a bunch of runtime facilities to run your app on with a portable abstraction between it and your application. If you compare it to python: Apache, python's bytecode interpreter and wsgi is your container. If you compare it to .Net: IIS, the CLR and System.Web is your container. Java EE just has a pretty strictly defined idea of what a container is and what it does and which bits you can swap out which is a *good thing*. I'd just walk away from such arguments to be honest and write some code. For ref, Java is not idiot proof, Java is not noob friendly (nothing is) and god doesn't use Python; he uses LISP (on a JVM) :) 
that doesn't work, I need a way to overrun the java settings
I raise you [Moai](getmoai.com), all the hassle of developing in Lua, none of the benefits that frameworks like Corona and LÖVE offer, docs that are 2 years behind the current release or are just plain wrong, almost no stackoverflow presence and an active user base of about 4 forum admins. And I'm forced to develop in it.. 
That is the override for the settings. -xmx and -xms
They may be conflicted on that front because of the Google lawsuit. Note that J2ME (yes, that J2ME) is still the #1 contender for mobile applications in terms of installed base.
Found it!!! I have been looking online and posting help things and you found the problem! Thank you so much :)
It was hiding in the Environment Variables
Why would you use the option for the minimum heap size and expect it to override the setting for the maximum heap size?
If you are using Java 7, you can generate serialVersionUID like this: private static final long serialVersionUID = 2014_04_17_001L; Whenever you make a change to the class, update the date / version. The _001 means it is the first version on that date. Of course this works also in Java versions below version 7, but you can't use the underscores. 
As for your question about getting Eclipse to generate this. Completely remove the private static final long serialVersionUID from your class. If your class implements Serializable, then Eclipse should flag the class name with a squiggly red underline. Hover your moose pointer over the class name underlined in red. In the popup yellow box it should say 2 quick fixes available. Click on: Add default serial version ID. 
My suggestion: use the tools that work well for the problem you're trying to solve, and don't worry so much about what other people think. That said... :-) I'm a former C developer with an affinity for Lisp-style languages that's found myself dragged into Java development. I've looked into both Python and Ruby over the years, and have found myself hard-pressed to work up any excitement for either of those languages. In their favor, they both have active communities, reasonable language designs, and a good ecosystem of supporting libraries and existing projects. Where things start to go bad (for me, YMMV) is that the runtime technologies behind Ruby and Python both suffer from a lack of concentrated development funding. 20 years ago, all three languages were roughly in the same spot: crude support for threading, basic automatic memory management, and strictly interpreted bytecode evaluation. Fast-forward 20 years, and you can see the effects of the fact that Sun/Oracle has invested heavily in the technology that underlies the JVM. The garbage collection is now state of the art, the interpreter has long since been replaced with an optimizing-to-native-machine-code compiler, and there is extensive and high quality support for multi-threaded operation. If that's not enough for you, other firms have also invested in the JVM, ranging from Azul's work on highly-parallel shared-memory multiprocessors and pauseless GC to tiny embedded devices. Bottom line: the JVM has a broad range of of high quality implementations that run on a variety of platforms. (here, I go off to check the latest python and ruby implementation source code) Meanwhile.... 20 years later... Python still has an (admittedly highly optimized) bytecode interpreter, reference counted GC, and marginal threading. Ruby's in more or less the same place. I've made the argument (and heard it from others countless times) that developer productivity should be prioritized over system performance. The idea is that a language like Python is enough more productive than other languages that you can save enough development time to more than offset the costs of using a slower language. I've also seen the argument carried to the point where the claim is made that easier to use languages can be *faster* than harder to use languages because the allow more time/mental-bandwidth for optimization tasks. However, in my experience, Python is not better enough in terms of ease of use to compensate for the gross deficiencies in its mainstream language implementation. Further, if you do want to gain some of the benefits of an 'easier to use' language, you can do so on the JVM, while still retaining access to whatever investment you've already made in Java code. Now... I'm off to write a Clojure script that sits on top of a high-performance multi-threaded database system written in Java....
Every language has trade-offs, as everyone has said. I am a huge fan of Python. Huge. But there is much magic that can be hidden in python. There are nasty runtime errors you can get in python that just couldn't happen in Java. Java is verbose because it is explicit. That kind of concreteness is very useful in large teams or teams that shift a lot. It also allows for better optimization. It is not idiot proof, but it does give some far more points of orientation than a comparable size python program. Containers do cause some overhead, but certainly not on the level of an interpreter. All that being said, python compiles down very nicely and is very expressive. And sometimes inscrutable magic (decorators, metaclasses etc) is exactly what you need. Tell your friends to repeat after me: Turing complete is Turing complete. There is no one tool for every job.
I have just begun I'm really late to the course because I transferred classes, so no I don't know how I'd start a new Java class with a main method.
I am aware of the issues. The problem is that LLVM still doesn't quite work on Windows. As for the weird internet compilation, Windows Phone 8 only uses native code. C++ and C++/CX applications are already compiled to native code. .NET MSIL gets compiled into native code as well into a format known MDIL. This is basically a PE DLL with native code for everything except symbols. The symbols are replaced by proper addresses on device by the linker when installing. 
It worked but it gave me a number 1L, instead of a big long number. Is that normal?
Actually J2ME is used a lot outside mobile applicaitons in the embedded space. Yes that is surely political, but that only makes me and others look elsewhere. Who would guess C++ and C# would have the focus they now enjoy on mobile platforms, thanks to Oracle inactivity?
Isn't this the same text as http://www.infoq.com/articles/Kicking-Off-Java-EE-8 ?
&gt;How much Scala do I really have to know? All of it. It's a Scala framework, duh! :P
1. You can use Java with Play Framework 2. Play Framework generates a package that is self contained and ready to deploy. I never used any PaaS so I don't know about those, I always deploy to instances on ec2 3. Depends on what you need. I was pretty enthusiast about Play when I started but now I'm not very happy about it. They assume too much and if you want to do things "not their way" for some reason, it's a nightmare. edit: Heroku supports it https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/play-support
As always is a trade-off, with dalvik/JVM you get garbage collection and you don't care about processor (ie 32/64b, fp... etc)
I imagine you aren't into gaming nor enterprise apps. 
TL;DR: Continue to use Java to build your back-end infrastructure since it's still one of the best platforms around for that purpose Continue to not use Java to build client applications because better technologies exist for that purpose.
That's some nice click bait.
&gt;I imagine you aren't into gaming nor enterprise apps. The Java enterprise app space dwarfs the C# one according to recent studies (sorry, am on mobile, google it yourself). As for mobile gaming, I see Android, iOS plus whatever Sony and Nintendo run on their hardware (hint: it doesn't contain .NET). So what exactly are you talking about?
Check out the tutorial resources at the /r/Javahelp wiki. If you're looking for Algorithms and Data structures, go for [Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) A good beginner's Java course is [Jave for Complete Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial) by John Purcell free on Udemy.com. Also, have a look at [Derek Banas' channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwRXb5dUK4cvsHbx-rGzSgw) - multiple languages.
I have! 1. I had to self teach a small amount due to some libraries not providing a *full* Java API, but minimal. I can't even say now that I 'know' Scala. 2. Play is load-balance enabled, if thats what you mean. Define 'Cloud' in terms of your question. 3. There are a few around, research them against your needs. Struts, Heroku, Spring (if you dare). I enjoyed using it, it feels intuitive and is super fast. I worked with a team of 2 others to design the back-end for an e-commerce site for a start-up company (PM me for address, but you wouldn't be able to tell it runs on Play! necessarily), it took us 6 months of working ~5 hours a week between us. I would recommend you definitely give it a go and see how you get on! It's been a couple of months since I last used it but I want to get back into it for another small project. 
It is awesome. Makes you super productive. But.. things will break. You won't always know why they break. You will have to google on scratch your head. But do it enough times and it will start to make sense ;) Edit - it will build a zip file with a run command. Dump it on any VPS and get it running in 30 seconds. It will package to all kinds of nice installers....
I think the Head First Java is a good introduction.
Elite?
That the gamming apps and many enterprise apps are written in C++ and C# when targeted to all mobile platforms. A market Oracle has lost, by not providing us the tools to do the same with Java.
In general, elite means the more capable group of people.
Elite is the paid releases. Major releases such as 5.1 are free but 5.1.1 is only available to paid subscribers. 
There's a page on the Java site (albeit quite hard to find) which explains just that: http://www.java.com/en/download/faq/java8.xml Basically, although Java 8 may be released, it's not on the main site (and won't be until the end of 2014) for users to download so it gives developers enough time to migrate their applications (or so what I assume).
Care to back up that assertion? C/C++ I understand, but where do you see C# in the mobile space?
Unity? And all these guys? http://xamarin.com/customers http://xamarin.com/consulting-partners
Yep. From the [PrimeFaces site](http://www.primefaces.org/elite/) &gt; PrimeFaces Elite is an annual subscription based service to access exclusive services such as certified maintenance releases and issue voting system.
Thank you!
You don't need to know all of Scala to use Play. Play 2 is implemented in Scala but provides a Java API, so you don't have to mess with Scala if you don't want to, or at least minimally. It's not idiomatic Java, but with Java 8 and lamdas, it is much better. Play's API may actually be the future of Java APIs. Also, you don't even need to know all of Scala to develop Scala applications. [Martin Odersky](http://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/8610) addressed this issue long ago with the Scala "language levels".
&gt;Unity? I was under the impression that unity was written in C++. And can be scripted in many languages. &gt;And all these guys? Please. Xamarin and all their partners are mere drops in the enterprise software bucket, with heavyweights like IBM betting on Java. I've worked as a consultant in the enterprise space for 7+ years and C# was a no-show in that job.
I am speaking about **MOBILE**!!!!! It that so hard to get it?! Where is Java on iOS, Windows Phone or a proper Java 7/8 compatible on Android, not to mention all the other wannabe mobile OS?
I've used it in many apps, it is really good, but don't rely on Ebeans, use hibernate or something else. I had with it many problems before i get rid of it. 
Hope, pray, pray more. 
Spaghetti and macaroni. 
[Programming, Motherfucker, Speaking-it.](http://programming-motherfucker.com/)
Singleton? I don't think OP was asking for anti-patterns.
Listener, listener, listener (android)
I appreciate the sentiment, and actually I have been programming basically Pascal for the last 20 years myself (independently of the language I'm actually programming on). However, it seems that if you interview at some places you have to know your patterns or else. 
Those are a good start. After those, you'll find out more, as you'll need to learn what you don't know :) there are a ton of books. Those are a good start though.
[Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) and other build tools. Learn servlets, server pages, server faces, etc. just to understand Then learn a Java web app framework like spring or struts. Make sure you grok MVC and how modern web applications are organized. Effective Java is like the Bible where I work. Honestly, if you work your way through that and understand every bit of it, then you're pretty well ahead of the curve.
Because the maximum one didn't work either.. anyways problem is solved :)
If you want the garbage collection to run more often why are you giving the JVM such an oversized heap to play with? Sounds like you should set a max heap of 512M. Not understanding how this is a leak or indeed unexpected.
Design patterns should be something to have in mind, like the way your grandma makes chicken, but don't feel bad if you don't "use" them. "do only what you need" is the best design pattern, because every time I see some implementation of a factory or visitor just-in-case-we-need-to-extend-this , it ends up being a mess.
I'm sorry, I don't have anything that will help you. But this video is quite relevant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY
Gross. Singletons. Did you also use global variables when you were learning C++ in school?
Take a look at this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9863625/difference-between-est-and-america-new-york-time-zones You don't want to be using PST/EST/CST/MST you should use the actual areas.
Though JavaFX 8 is very promising, you're right.
Awesome, thank you.
People will gladly help but we won't do your homework for you. Why is your code not working? What does it look like?
Design Patterns are not a methodology.
Probably start with creating a method that takes a parameter and returns its factorial 
strategy, builder, facade
&gt;I am speaking about **MOBILE**!!!!! Me too. &gt;Where is Java on iOS, Windows Phone or a proper Java 7/8 compatible on Android, not to mention all the other wannabe mobile OS? There is Java 6(-ish) on Android and RoboVM on iOS. Windows Phone, no, but despite remarkable growth during the last month (Edit: months), the platform still lags behind its competitors and is not considered a serious deployment target by many, especially outside of Seattl...*cough* the US. I hear the Xamarin offers aren't all ready for prime time, either, though the evidence is anecdotal so far. As I said before, Oracle has shot its own foot with that lawsuit.
Nice job! Very legible

Now I'm hungry.
For iOS try [RoboVM](http://www.robovm.org/)
I work on an application that has sooooo much code bloat because of the overuse of patterns that its almost impossible now for anyone coming onto the program to be able to grasp how things fit together. To do even the most mundane things takes weeks of effort because of the time spent to figure out how different components and frameworks fit together. To me the most frustrating thing is that so much of the application is built via configuration files and property tiles and beans which provide you with none of the help that a compiler and an ide does when writing code. 
* -1 for the page background color that makes my eyes bleed * an additional -1 for zed shaw note that's a pair of metaphorical -1s, i didn't actually -1 you, except metaphorically, so don't -1 me bro (literal -1)
I know it pretty well. I am speaking about Oracle, not third party stuff. 
The users are actually selecting from a list of the fully named time zones. This is just for the email alerts. Presumably, if they are doing any automated parsing, that will be taken into account. 
Also, a lot of the tooling and ecosystem around Java also applies to other JVM languages like Scala and Groovy. 
To really show your rage, you should multiply those two -1's together, instead of using simple addition. That'll show me!
Good question. * Not a 'design pattern' as in the book per se, but code that validates its own state (using `assert` and `if(…) throw` checks) plus stupid tests that just run it. * Utility classes. Yes, that's deemed a code smell by many, but I find that plain pure static functions are often easiest to test; and often they don't find a place in another class. * Composites. I just love them to bits.
No loves for templates? They're awesome for things like Web requests. 
Yep, been there myself. Plus, developers take the whole "don't re-invent the wheel" thing too far sometimes too... often, writing 50 lines of good, simple, well-documented code will be more maintainable than adding a new library to make the one call in its place... the time it takes to look at the docs of the library and digest them is sometimes more than just reading those 50 lines of code, not to mention the time sometimes lost when you try to upgrade the library and find you need to touch your code to make it compatible with the new version. Obviously, this requires knowing where to draw that line properly because it's easy to screw up either way. 
Please don't provide complete solutions. This looks like a homework assignment and OP should try to solve it by himself. Helping is encouraged, solving is discouraged. **Complete solution removed**
These are two *completely* differents things. Spring "singletons" are NOT singletons-as-in-the-design-pattern. 
Don't use GoF patterns every day. Just don't. 90% of your code should be as straightforward as possible. Don't make useless wrappers, abstract factories, strategies, or generally any abstraction that isn't warranted by a real need. Even if it looks pretty. 
There is not much to DI. If used correctly, the containers just call the correct constructors/setters and pull the dependencies together. Of course, with autowire this can get needlessly complicated, but the main idea is still the same. If you want to learn, I recommend looking at a medium-sized spring project – in particular the XML configuration, which is central to the DI part of spring. Edit: Don't recoil in horror unless you have read and understood the whole thing.
&gt; every time I see some implementation of a factory or visitor just-in-case-we-need-to-extend-this , it ends up being a mess. Reminds me of this article on [how not to write Factorial](http://chaosinmotion.com/blog/?p=622). I recommend to read it.
[XP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming), the skinny brother of [AD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)
builder, factory &amp; command 
While we certainly would like that to be true, it actually means [chosen people](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=elite&amp;allowed_in_frame=0).
Spaghetti code and lasagna code (=too many layers).
Spring 4 recommend setting up dependency injection without any XML configuration. I'd recommend against doing an xml configuration at this point. Check out the guides on spring.io as a great starting point.
I stand corrected - my spring-fu is getting a bit rusty, it appears. Thank you for pointing this out.
If standards are important for you I'd recommend you use CDI. Weld is a pretty good CDI implementation that comes with jboss/wildfly and glassfish. It best integrated with web applications, but it can be used in Java SE environments too. CDI has a much smaller API than Spring and might be a lot easier to learn.
Learn CDI with weld. It is simpler than Spring IOC and does not require as much configuration. You should also learn Spring as it is still used in a lot of projects and will not be dead anytime soon. If you are working on a new project then I would stick with Java EE.
Composite,Visitor,Observer 2cents
...still doesn't excuse you from basic skills. lol
Functors, Mixins, Default Arguments....... oh wait
All of the DI frameworks are now capable of using the @Provides/@Inject style annotations to configure dependency injection, so it looks like we're converging on a standard implementation within the community. Personally, I avoid Spring because it's pretty heavy for the sort of micro-service work I do these days, but it is a very featureful framework. I also like Guice/Dagger/Apache DeltaSpike/Weld.

I have spoke with an Oracle engineer last week, March 2015 is when Java 8 is planned to replace Java 7... The Critical Patch Updates that are public will end for Java 7 shortly after...
It does, you pretentious prick. Nothing better to worry about other than grammar mistakes people make on the internet?
Uhh, ok? Singleton is a singleton in my book, but whatever. How that singleton is accessed is another matter: Service Locator, getInstance()? (which I assume is what you refer to?), DI, etc.

Did you interest stem from writing your own Minecraft plugins?
looks awful. * forces you to use some GUI tool * POJOs are generated from the tool, not easy to code them yourselves * POJOs have to extend a Cayenne object So many anti-patterns here I don't even know where to start. Sure, JPA is not perfect (no ORM tool is), but it is light years ahead in terms of logical approach to ORM. 
Ok. I believe I understand. Let me just recap. Both examples create a new object but the second creates a static object so it will be killed when the activity is killed. Additionally, the first example creates a new object but it isn't tied to the underlying class. Did I understand you correctly? Thank you again for your help.
The entire source code like the whole java class for the MainActivity? It is about 8500 lines so I didn't think it would be helpful to post. methodCall is declared static in my activity/class. 
What from the source code are you wanting to look at? I'd be happy to take segments out and post it.
Not always, what about "An elite rescue squad"? Do you think about chosen people then who aren't very good really, or about the best team a place has to offer? Consider the text: "The Special Rescue Team (特殊救難隊 Tokushu Kyūnan Tai?) is the elite search and rescue unit of the Japan Coast Guard. The team was established to respond to special maritime accidents and disasters." Do you think the writer here refers to a bunch of people sitting on their high horses, or to a bunch of very capable people?
I disagree with this. In my experience, every time this occurs 1. Those 50 lines of code take x times longer to write than you anticipated. 1. Those 50 lines of code have no direct relation to the problem you're actually trying to solve. 1. There's an obscure bug somewhere in those 50 lines of code. 1. The 50 lines of code violate the SRP (eg: this `isBlank` method checks if a String is blank but also removes `br` tags) whereas the tried-and-true library keeps it simple. Not to mention 99% of the time the library is already well documented and well known.
yeah, you were definitely right. So I was creating a picture object from the picture class and creating a turtle object to be sent into the picture object. I figured since the picture object is a copy of the actual image it would be treated in a manner that would allow for easy manipulation of the image by the turtle drawing commands. I tried multiple ways to try to approach to repainting or updating the image but nothing really worked for me, until I created a new world, then sent the picture object into the world to be set as the background, and then sent the turtle into the world. Then suddenly everything worked perfectly. 
With all due respect, I would recommend using the Spring Framework if you can. If that's not possible, pardon the interruption.
Although there are many commercially sold books on Spring, for each of the projects that Spring offers, they generally have a wonderful Reference guide that in my experience trumps anything you can buy. They are not for sale anywhere but you can always stay late at work some night and print them off at work. It's worth it. (Or just read it on the screen if that's your preference) [Spring Framework Reference 4.1.2](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/pdf/spring-framework-reference.pdf)
Here's a [link](http://np.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/2hx3by/first_ever_day_learning_java_made_a_glorious_bot/) to the referenced post.
I don't know much about Java tutorials (never really been interested until yesterday), but there's a free tutorial series for C#, which is basically a newer, Windows exclusive, language. They are both really similar, but I have no idea where they are other than different libraries for variables, so someone have to correct me on that.
Check out [Derek Banas Youtube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/user/derekbanas/playlists). They are awesome.
Java's shortcomings get obvious, when you start making anonymous classes and hacks like that, so the "platonic" idea of patterns gets completely lost in that.
For what it's worth, gson seems to be more recently updated so I woudl go with that.
1. Learn java. 2. Learn android. I think there is a guide in /r/androiddev
Does seem like a copy of my original article at InfoQ ;)
Thanks! also, for the future. what parser is generally best for general use?
Does it use a distributed cluster caching? Like... you know... the butt?
Not quite. When the JVM needs to reference a class for the first time, the class loader will try to find the class on the classpath. It will then create a Class object representing this class (not an instance of the class, let's say of type Foo, rather a Class&lt;Foo&gt;). This Class object is used for all static references. So even if you create your own instance of the class and call a static method on it, the JVM will still delegate to the class loader's Class object. So with respect to your examples, creating an object just to make a static method call is totally unnecessary (and IDEs will typically advise against it).
When I have a choice, I almost always use Jackson. It's fairly simple to use, and is the most feature rich parser I have worked with. It has a [streaming API](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonStreamingApi) and a [lightweight version](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-jr) for resource constrained devices. See https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson for more info.
I second Jackson. All of the features, well supported, and it's supposedly the fastest one for Java right now.
Your quoted text doesn't make any sense, transaction boundaries in J2EE are at the method level not per object and JPA doesn't have anything to do with REST serialization. You don't know the basics about the technology in question yet you're concerned with object oriented purity? Here's a hint, if you work for me and you come to me talking about object oriented purity and you don't know the basics, well, I'd be regretting that hiring decision.
Excellent, thank you! :)
With the word "explicit" in the title, I thought I was about to view a NSFW post. :)
I guess my question is 1. How can you use JPA entities in an OO way? 1. How can you use EJBs in an OO way? Just like your experience, I've never seen it done. In fact, to me it seems like they get in your way if you try to be OO. 
Ok so that's like beginning beginner, I agree with the guy who recommended getting a new book, if yours doesn't teach that. 
So. A big thing that I somewhat disagree with when it comes to common methods of teaching code at Universities is the fact that the students can often be trapped in a theoretical bubble. Generally this arises from too much focus on theory rather than practice, and never really pushing a student out of their comfort zone. A few years ago I was asking the same questions so here are some things that might help. **A. Eclipse is an IDE,what does this mean?** Integrated Development Environment. When you *write JAVA* you are just putting text in a document. At a very basic level you can write a JAVA program by writing all of your code in Notepad, compiling it from Command Line and running a compiled JAR with a command like "java -jar myJar.jar." If we all programmed like this; we'd have a lot less programmers. The alternative is using an IDE, which rolls all of this functionality into a concise visual interface. At it's base, JAVA as a language is (Like all languages) a pre-agreed upon list of commands that are expected to achieve a very specific result no matter the circumstance. Knowing this, the question beings to turn into one of . . . **B. Implementation.** You're right in the middle of what one can consider a healthy java coding familiarity right now. In the sense that you know abstract, vanilla java without an awareness of where to actually place said code. Some examples of where you might place your work are: * A web server such as a Raspberry Pi * A commercial use computer such as a laptop. * An Android App All of these implementations contain specific tweaks and nuances that are layered upon your pre-existing knowledge of JAVA so that you can extend downward and plant roots into the specific environment you're working with in. If you're in the middle, and that's all below you. Then above you there must be. . . **C. Frameworks and Platforms.** On TOP of JAVA (Or, again, any language really) there are also frameworks that you can learn. For example, [LibGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) is a popular game development library that assume familiarity with Java and then adds more functionality specific to game development. Or you might use Spring which helps to write cleaner server side applications in less time. Often times with all of these tool-sets you'll be using a fair amount of their functionality while you use your base knowledge like a glue to fit it all together. To remedy any confusion you might have about what goes where, how and why, I suggest finding a project you can work on and truly be passionate about. For many people this might be game development, so you might make a simple game on the side using a specialized game library. Or maybe you have a great idea for a website that you gotta see, so you might Google "Web-app development with JAVA." What's most likely to frustrate you if you aren't naturally inclined to self teach without rails is the fact that there is probably a lot of stuff completely unrelated to core java that you will have to wrangle with in order to get your project started. For a web app, you should know basic network such as DNS, IP/TCP and how servers really work, additionally how to configure path variables in an operating system. Lots of small stuff like that can lead to big headache during project set-up because there's a great chance that your program never really pushed you into learning persistent Google-ing and troubleshooting across a wide variety of contexts. Some services and platforms you should be familiar with (Meaning, aware of what they do, why you should use them, and why you should't use the) are: * GIT * Maven * Gradle * Guava * Ant * Tomcat * Jetty These are a wide spread of terms that span a variety of different tasks, but are mostly relevant (Excluding GIT, which is more universal) to the world of Java. Hope that helped.
First of all, if your school only teaches IDE centered examples that's kinda sad. At my university every semester there is at least one "big" project where we can apply all the things we have learned so far. As an example there was a Coffee-Ordering System at the first or second semester and later there were more complex things like an Use-Case driven development of an ERP Solution using Web-Services. Your Question relating to Hardware Interaction is a little weird. Java is not really "Hardware Oriented" like C/C++. Of course you can use libraries to add functionality (In fact I am doing exactly that at the moment, because I am currently developing a new java based Software for a CNC-Foamcutting machine), but that's rather odd. If you meant File and UI by hardware interaction, there are several Tutorials on Youtube. Things like how to pack your (Eclipse)-Project into a jar-file are also covered in many YT-Videos At the end the thing I can really recommend is, learn by doing your own stuff. If you think, hey I could really use a tool to do this or that and it's at least in reach of your scope, try to program it by yourself. You may/will run into problems within the development, but if thats the case, bite in and look on sites like stackoverflow for that specific problem. In fact learning programming is like learning a language (which in fact it is in some way...). You can't learn a language out of books, you have to speak it.
Yeah, that would indeed be nice. We can target it via the Javascript backend atm, not super ideal :/
Just get stuck in! Start building things! That's the only way. All the theory will come in to play when you need it. So pick something simple you'd like to build and start building. Along the way learn Git and other tools as you need them. You should put the effort in with Git right from the start, as it's one of those things that you can only understand properly by doing, and it'll take a few months to get comfortable with it. The same with IDE's, I like Eclipse because you can code in pretty much any language with it. But the main thing is to build something. You want to work with hardware, start with something like Arduino, or BOEbot maybe. You'll learn loads about hardware. Or maybe even Android, it's mostly Java and you've got plenty of sensors to play around with on most Android devices. The best way to understand these things is to build something and use them. So get started!
The best way i think to look at this is as a way to change the "Hello World!" programm. I think there were a exercise where you already played with variables and user input ? Say in a way like : &gt;\&gt;Whats your name ? &gt;GreatAuntMuriel &gt;\&gt;Hello GreatAuntMuriel ! So you know how to get user input and display text and variables. The rest should be easy: * write the lines with welcome text and ask for "Ammount of tasty cookies you want ?" probably **println()** * get the user input in the variable (use **java.util.Scanner** or **java.io.BufferedReader**) * write the 6 lines of recipe and use variable to change the ammounts of ingrediens, kindof : System.out.println(" After that exact time, you and every of your friends will enjoy " + numberOfCookies / numberOfPeople + " holiday cookies."); have fun backing! 
Actually, it's meant to read "Keep it simple *and* stupid."
decorator, dependency injection, inversion of control
As LucidPanic said, you will need to use Scanner. It is pretty simple, [here](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html) is a link to its documentation if you need to read up on it. [Here is the documentation for System.](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#field_detail) This will be needed to send output to the console and designate the use of Scanner. Other than that, you will need to: * Store the variables. * Apply some basic mathematics to them. * Display the new variables with some text. If you get confused, let us know. We will be more than happy to help you - ensure to include your code, as well. Good luck!
&gt; I have not written an EJB since about 2007 Yet you are somehow confinced that nothing has changed since then? 
Ok.. So I know I entered the correct format/place due to the fact that if I open the pom in eclipse (with the pom editor), I can see the Dependencies tab that it exists. If I then go into a POJO and (for example): @ServerEndpoint(value = "/socialtest") public class SocialTestEndpoinf { Then it cannot resolve: import javax.websocket.server.ServerEndpoint; The jars (for example the websockets) is not appearing as an imported Jar in eclipse, where as if I get a project from github (for example) it all works.. Cheers
Nahh.. as other projects (complete from guthib) all work, even if I nuke the .m2 directory, i can see them downloading all the files again successfully.
If you really need to install it in your local repository it's done using the following method. Download the .jar file [here](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax.websocket/javax.websocket-api/1.0) afterwards open your command line &amp; run the following command: mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=javax.websocket -DartifactId=javax.websocket-api -Dversion=1.0 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=/path/to/file Where /path/to/file corresponds to the place where you downloaded the .jar file.
I've been using Spring Data, JPA, Hibernate, etc. but came into contact with Cayenne this year. The tech lead thought dependency injection was a dumb concept and other ORM tools weren't worth learning. Perhaps this is more my experience than the software itself, but it was weird. Cayenne was not a pleasant experience, in comparison to newer ORM.
No, of course not. I've just focused on Spring. For example, I think JPA is a wonderful and clean spec that I would have no problem using.
EJB is now rather clean as well ;)
Any reason you picked Web Apps specifically? Personally, I've never heard of Jetty, prefer the Apache Commons libs over Guava, and think ANT is on its way out as a build system (Gradle is where it's at). I'm an Android dev who loves his job and is passionate about programming. Although I understand the popularity of the items you listed, having an understanding of all of them is not required. It's more important than you know how to work with concepts instead of technologies. Here's my "should know" list: * Version Control (git, subversion, etc.) * What external libraries are and how and when to use them (Guava, Apache Commons, JUnit, etc.) * What a build system is, and why and how to use one. Know at least one of them well. (ANT, Gradle, etc.) * What application frameworks are used for and know at least one well (Android, Play!, etc.) * Unit testing, test driven development, and why testing is so important (JUnit) * Coding standards and anti-patterns (Effective Java is great for this, and checkstyle is great at warning you about common issues) * Dependency management (maven, gradle) * What a REST API is and how to make and use one Keep in mind that Java is not the only language many companies use. Many, like mine, are polyglot and do things like use Java for Android, Python for data processing, and PHP for a REST server. Feel free to branch out and try doing a webserver in PHP, for example. Even if you stay a Java dev, exposure to a scripting language will improve how you think about Java and any other languages you happen to know. It's exposure to concepts, not technology, that is important. If you can show mastery of concepts to employers, they can hire you into any position you want. Conversely, mastery of technologies over concepts will limit your options in the profession and you will have to risk your knowledge becoming obsolete. Knowing how to write a build script in XML is not important. Knowing what a build script is, why you should use them, and writing one is. 
Did you install the m2e plugin in Eclipse?
Also, is the project type in Eclipse a Maven project?
We use eclipse here and I have done for years and years.. I will try re-running the mvn eclipse:eclipse again..
'mvn eclipse:eclipse' can be used to create an Eclipse project from Maven project model (pom.xml file), but it does not create any automatic dependency management within the project to reflect later changes made to the pom.xml file. You need to re-run 'mvn eclipse:eclipse' after each change to synchronize project models (Eclipse and Maven). Alternatively you can use for example m2e-plugin, to get the automation in place (in which case there is no need to run 'mvn eclipse:eclipse' at all, just import the Maven project).
The better technologies for front end purposes would be what? Python and PHP? I just started learning Java after seeing all the jobs available for java skills, my only goal is to get a reasonable/comfortable job. So I'm cool with back end stuff (lol) for now. 
Rerunning it worked (as someone mentioned above).. I will check I have the plugin.. as I have all the maven options under run/debug.. My plugins.. seems installed.. most odd. [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/L8gBnQd.png) 
I think that classpath scanning is a bad idea, because it makes too many things implicit and thus makes it hard to reason about the system.
cs is a young field relatively speaking and it's taught extremely poorly. i have never used a single data structure other than an array and a relational database but i can tell you the big O notation of searching a linked list! because school fills your head with useless crap. everything i learned about java or webdev i did on my own (by that i mean via youtube, stackoverflow, forums, etc.) with the exception of one cs class. information is free on the internet yet we still have to pay a premium for useless knowledge to prove that we can jump through hoops and regurtitate facts as they are presented to you...what was the question again? PS i did have a CS teacher who was awesome and every 2 weeks we built a new program, tested and deployed it and did a code review in small groups. i learned more in 8 1-hour code reviews than i did in the other 3.5 fucking years. do things on your own. unless you want to be an academic CS PhD (which is super cool, too, just not what most people are there for) then just realize that you will never use any of the shit you are learning in cs. you'll get more 'real world' experience by building a program on your own from scratch and deploying it.
Duly noted, thank you!
Coursera has 2 free android courses, one of which just started. The only that just started assumes a good knowledge of java though.
in theory, a RESTful API is a web service that utilizes a standard lingo where HTTP methods (GET,POST,PUT,DELETE) drive the action. it was proposed in a [PhD thesis](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm). e.g. say you have an object: * do a GET to http://www.api.com/items/object to retrieve the object from the API * do a PUT to http://www.api.com/items/object to create/update/replace the object stored in the API * etc. in practice, a RESTful API is just business-speak for any API over HTTP
Great presentation!
If you've run the 'mvn eclipse:eclipse', you probably opened the project as normal Eclipse project (which uses Eclipse's own dependency management mechanisms instead of Maven's). To get the automatic project model synchronization, you need to delete the Eclipse project files created by 'mvn eclipse:eclipse' and import the Maven project using m2e.
Not that I know of. It's not always easy to see when you're making mistakes like this, though. If you use an example instead of an analogy, I may be able to answer more confidently. 
Thank you for the help, I appreciate it. What's the definition of the "service layer" / what's in the "service layer"? I can't find that in the DDD book. Is this where your EJBs reside? I'm going to do a little research and maybe I'll have more questions. Once again, thanks for taking my question seriously.
Fyi, I actually clarify in the post that "having an understanding of" just means knowing what they are and what they do. Including knowing that they are on their way out if they are outdated. The most it ever takes is ten minutes of looking around their site so that you aren't ever blindsided if someone asks you what "x" is. You'll notice I listed several tools that do the same thing. Additionally, be aware of what hammers do what in your toolbox, and which ones you probably won't ever need to use.
There are a lot of things implicit about Java and the JVM. Singling out this extremely useful bit of functionality to complain about doesn't make sense.
Unless they're needed, I don't focus on design patterns. I do tend to think a lot about logging and error handling. In concrete terms, this means: * Make sure that anything that gets opened/allocated is ultimately closed/freed (in a finally block). [try...with...resources](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html) is a big help, and you can also make it hard to forget the finally with [creative use of runnables](http://www.ksmpartners.com/2013/06/dynamic-extent-in-java/). * Exception messages and logging both have to be comprehensive so that the error can be clearly identified and diagnosed in the logs. * `toString`implementations produce useful results when the objects are included in log messages. * I have a couple shorthand [static methods for throwing runtime exceptions](http://www.ksmpartners.com/2014/03/details-in-java-code-error-reporting-and-loop-control-variables/). These methods make it easier to grep/scan for runtime exception throws and also allow more room for clear error messages. * Clearly document the behavior of your methods, including how they might fail as well as what happens if they do fail. 
A lot of Universities are starting to figure this out and are starting to integrate more real-world courses. The problem is the field requires a weird mix of theory and practical knowledge to be successful. 
&gt; What I have a problem with is that this extremely powerful feature is misused This can be said about anything. You can't condemn something because idiots use it like idiots.
i disagree, i think the theoritical knowledge i learned was completely useless and has contributed nothing to my success as a developer. possible exception of floating point arithmentic, depending on whether you think that is theoritical or practical. what theoritical stuff have ended up using?
Good to know :)
Ahh i imported it like a normal eclipse project, not a m2e project. /edit, that was it.. that was the simple problem.. :) Thanks
Is there any free way of being able to sign applications?
If you are in an large enterprise with an Active Directory Certificate Services infrastructure in place, and all your client machines trust those CAs, you can generate certificates to import and sign with. If you are a dev developing apps for multiple customers, then you are limited to what the clients trust for Trust Root Certification Authorities in the client device, be it Windows 7 or Mac OS. Then you need to buy certs from a public CAs to sign with.
My original comment was worded too broadly. Thank you for reminding me that everything is a matter of context.
In my case it is definitely the latter part. I have only experience buying SSL certificates. Just at a quick look, it looks like they are prohibitively expensive for individuals just trying to make their basic projects (think student) not produce scary warnings.
Hello, you're welcome, glad I could help. And concerning the layers, apps are usually structured in 3 layers: persistence layer (repositories), service layer (services, can be implemented using EJB stateless session beans or Spring singletons), and presentation layer (JAX-WS/RS or frontend controllers). I think if you check this 100 page (free) book DDD Quickly http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/domain-driven-design-quickly you will find the answers you are looking for. This book has AFIK the blessing of Evans as well. Services, Repositories, Root aggregates, value objects everything is in there. If after reading this you do a second round on JPA and EJB, everything will make a lot more sense this time around. 
Neither EJB nor JPA are designed with "object thinking" in mind. They both treat objects as data structures (similar to C or COBOL structs), encouraging you to inject and retrieve data from them. I wrote an article a few weeks ago about Getters/Setters: http://www.yegor256.com/2014/09/16/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html. This is exactly what JPA is asking you to do - getters and setters. So, the bottom line is that you should avoid JPA and EJB if you want to be object oriented.
For a student, you don't need to buy a certificate. You can generate your own. Using the jarsigner tool in the JDK, you can generate your own certficates with the JDK keystore. The term is self-signed certificate. You can export the certificates from the keystore and import those certificates into the OS into the trust the certificate you generated with the jarsigner tool. In windows 7 (typical client OS) you can open certmgr.msc, go to the Trust Root Certification Authorities, right click and start the importing process of the certificate. Good you have an understanding of SSL certificates, the big thing about certificates, they are used for encryption, code signing and more. Code signing when it comes to keeping your Java app running, is "big" now. 
+1 I second on this. A container is an infrastructure that you can use or can ignore. In most lightweight web apps containers are not used.
Yes, containers may cause an overhead, if being used where they are not required. As far as I understand, they were invented in order to make Java web apps "pluggable". However, a more lightweight (and less interoperable) approach proved to be more suitable in most cases. Instead of composing an application from components talking on EJB bus, it's better to make them separate RESTful web apps talking through JSON/XML API calls. So, Java EE is losing, RESTful interfaces are taking over :)
you have to store session information somewhere (like a db or shared memory server) where other servers can get access to it, instead of only in the application server's local memory. As each interaction with your "site" may touch different servers each time. Other solutions could be session affinity or session serialization.
There are TWO (perhaps more ) general ways to use maven and eclipse together. 1) Use maven to generate the eclipse project. (mvm eclipse:eclipse) 2) Use an eclipse plugin which use the POM to define the project. When you change the pom, in general, the project stays up to date. (m2e plugin ) I personally find #2 to be a much better way to work. I do, occasionally, have to have the project get regenerated via menu ( this takes about 20 second ). But for things like adding dependencies, it's quick an easy. I used to use #1 and have not done this for perhaps 3 years. 
Hi - spring.io/guides is meant to help with this exactly. There are guides on security, the framework, Spring Integration, Batch, Data, MVC, etc etc. Theyre all 10-15 minute long, code-driven introductions. They assume *nothing* in terms of prior experience / setup. Even the SDK and build files are explained.
Arrays cannot be resized and don't enforce any constraints like uniqueness or order. They don't support fast searching unless it's ordered. However, they're pretty alright if you know how many things you're going to have beforehand and don't need any of those cool things that more advanced data structures provide.
Comodo does code sign certs too https://www.comodo.com/e-commerce/code-signing/code-signing-certificate.php
Care to elaborate on your question? At the moment it sounds like your follow up question will be to explain the difference between Java the language and Java the Indonesian island.
Except for some really cutting edge stuff, most systems I've seen that had problems scaling were down to : A) bad SQL or O/R mapper usage B) bad data paging implementation, where a page returned all the information available to it or returned a bloated dataset, which took very long to read and serialise C) over-engineered SOA suites where XML processing can easily take up all the resources D) too many threads running simultaneously, leading to resource starvation At least these are the ones which pop into my head. 
&gt; A) bad SQL or O/R mapper usage Can you elaborate on that?
I'm not quite understanding your question, but When declaring an array ex. int[] You're essentially working with what I'm assuming you're calling the data structure. An implementation like ArrayList uses an array as the list implementation. 
Food for thought, thanks.
Ctrl shift o, never write any import statements ever again.
For the many of us, the IDE does import optimization for us. /u/esanchma has the correct answer, even for IDE behavior, because we also have something called 'code folding' in our IDE that will hide that long list of 'import yet.another.packages' Basically, you need to get an IDE like Intellij , Netbeans, or Eclipse and stop worrying about stuff like this. 
After you save your pom.xml in eclipse: * Depending on your version of eclipse, highlight the project (not the POM) * right click * select "Maven-&gt;Update Project" or preferably (Alt-F5) The alternative is to exit maven then do a call to the goal that would download the dependency then generate the eclipse project. If it were a standard compile time dependency then: * mvn install eclipse:eclipse
Fully qualified imports explain what your class has actually imported, and explains from which package something came, at a glance. If I had a class full of * imports, then I have no idea where a class came from. It could have come from any of the star imports. If I wanted to get a quick Maven POM dependency block for a class I need, I can't easily google the class name because I have no idea which package it came from.
Everyone else here is correct that * imports are considered bad practice (and I agree), but there is no performance penalty for doing so. You are just importing the names which are going to be resolved during compilation, it isn't even like C headers where the file is included so there isn't a compile time performance hit either.
To avoid name collisions. There's only so many ways to name a class. 
I frequently scan the import list when researching and working with legacy projects. Also, imports are for the compiler, they aren't in the generated class file so your hypothesis about runtime memory usage is incorrect/false.
Good. Fix your broken, sloppy security models.
There is no performance effect at all, because it's resolved at compile time. Modern IDEs take care of the import line for you. Mine seems to insert .* if my class imports more than a certain number of classes from the same package. The only problem with importing something.* is when this causes you to import two different classes with the same name, but in that case you'll get a compilation error. It's simply not a problem like it can be in some dynamically typed languages. 
I don't know how a Java compiler works exactly, but I'm guessing that when it runs into an unresolved name, it will go over the list of imports to see if it can be resolved with one of them. If true, it would lead me to think it can in fact lead to a compile-time impact, however negligible it would be. I'll gladly be proven wrong though! Edit: while writing this comment, I completely forgot that we're comparing the asterisk to an explicit list. In that case, the explicit list will no doubt be more efficient. 
http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=3c1b487d I'd recommend having a look at this talk from JavaZone a few weeks ago. He talks about just that. TL;DR: community says don't do it, but there are pretty compelling reasons to use wildcards and its recommended by Robert Martin.
Good call, Reflections is the obvious alternative but for those using Spring already this would mean one less dependency to manage.
To sum up all the correct comments: * Yes, it's bad practise, because it makes imported classes implicit. We like our code to say what it uses. * No, it doesn't affect performance - javac will get a tiny bit slower while resolving class path resources, but that's well in the millisecond range for most projects. * IDEs will take care of it automatically. Most have a setting to use * when importing more than N classes from a package, but I usually disable that.
*in eclipse thought :)
Looks like it could be an easy solution. What does it do about interdependent systems of rules? Given an unsolvable set of rules (say, a set of mutually exclusive conditions) , does it blow up, go into an endless loop, or fail gracefully?
Very High, High, Medium. This the security equivalent of setting the volume to 11.
/u/esanchma has another great example, but no one has yet mentioned the seminal example for this rule: import java.util.List; import java.awt.List: When you star import and your libraries change you can break your compile.
It’s Command-Option-O in IDEA.
You mean like an [Active Record pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern)? What you're asking for *is* a database. What you maybe don't want is a *remote* database or a SQL database. Just a base for your data. Something you can store in-memory or to flat files. Those exist for sure. Your requirements can probably be met by any sort of cache that supports file persistence like [ehcache](http://ehcache.org/) or [guava cache.](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/CachesExplained)
Thanks for that. I don't think that's what I'm looking for. I looked at both ehcache and even started out with the guava cache, but my requirements are very different. I don't need soft-references or LRU or even any other service from the map (in fact, I need to always know exactly what it has), so guava's cache didn't bring any benefits to the table and even ehcache is way too complicated for what I need it to do. In fact, the storage environment I've already done in a 200-line class, that is not the issue. No. What I'm after is something like we had in Local Entity Objects back in EJB1 or Hibernate's local entity instance just after you take it out from the query results. Namely, that the properties of the entity are in a one-to-one relationship with some data-backing structure, but in this case it isn't a locally stored value-object serialized from the DB or the DB-connection itself, but some form of abstract provider, which I can implement via my own cache. In other words, a pluggable, lightweight entity-container, where I could map the entities back into my own storage. How you define database is terminology, so I would rather not go there. Once again, thanks for your answer.
Hmm... I believe I kinda know what happens. I initiated a GMT date. Then I displayed it. It looks like it shows me what would have been the equivalent time in my local time zone, so of course it would be "tomorrow", ie. if someone that lives in a GMT area tells me it's 4:30 in the morning on October 4, that would actually be 8:30 PM on October 3 from where I am. Simply put, it does not convert it. It creates a date object with GMT date of October 3, 8:30 PM. When I display it, it then converts that to my local time zone, which is correctly done as +8 hours.
I'll try this out. I posted a reply below basically static the same thing as your answer I guess we just posted around the same time. At least now I got confirmation that that's what's happening. Update: I guess just to elaborate further on what's happening here: This code `gmtDateFormat.format(date)` is the one that actually converts the `date` to GMT. This gives a string value of `10/03/2014 12:30` (note that my input date is `10/3/2014 20:30`). This conversion is correct. Then `defaultDateFormat.parse(...)` parses the string and converts it to a date. This just basically reads your string and creates a date object, no conversion done. So now I have a date object with value of October 3, 2014 at ~~20:30~~12:30. ~~Dates, afaik, are not concerned about time zones.~~ If I needed a date object, I could use this exact line of code. However, I just really need a string so I can write that to an XML (field is just a string). So I could just get the output of `gmtDateFormat.format(date)`. ~~I have to try out if everything works still when daylight savings is involved.~~ It does work. Gets the same result as this conversion: http://www.timezoneconverter.com/cgi-bin/tzc.tzc Thanks for this! This helped a lot and made things a lot clearer! Update: Fixed value of the date object.

Yes. That. Session affinity scales to a point. _(when I mention Tomcat, assume I mean any java application container server)_ But for real scalability keep as little session information as possible. Store the session information somewhere that all your Tomcat servers can access it, and update it after each http transaction. Since session information should not need to persist permanently, a shared memory server is a good place to store session information. When an http connection comes in, your front end distributor can send it to any random Tomcat server. That server handles that single http transaction. The next http request from the same user may get randomly sent to a different Tomcat server. Each Tomcat server must be able to rapidly get the session information from a cache server. Alternately your front end distributor can do cookie injection into your http responses to the end user's browser. Then when the end user makes another http request, the front end distributor knows that this particular end user session goes to a certain specific Tomcat server. That is called session affinity. Once the user logs out or their session times out, the establishment of a new session from that user will get associated with whatever Tomcat server is least used at the moment they log in. Problems with session affinity: Not as scalable as Google / Facebook / Twitter style scalability. If one Tomcat server in your server farm goes down, then all of the users sessions currently tied to that sever also go down. Depending on the length of sessions, and the timing of user log in / log out, some Tomcat servers may end up servicing more sessions than other servers. That is, the workload of session servicing may end up being uneven. With random distribution of each incoming http request, workload remains evenly distributed across all application servers. If one application server goes down and the front end distributor knows about it, it can remove this server from the random distribution and there is no disruption of service whatsoever. This also allows you to deliberately take down servers for upgrades, and then gradually roll out an upgrade across all of your servers, with no downtime. I hope all of that makes sense.
Thank you! I keep reading about how hard time zones are in Java and to just use Joda Time. Unfortunately, adding another library is not an option for me. Also, the thing I'm working on isn't certified for Java 8 so I have to use Java 7. But I will look into this as it looks like they did address concerns a lot of people are having about time conversions.
As handjobs said, it really is more than a simple answer. His answer says it all, but requires understanding of what each means. Here are a few. Bad SQL. You have to learn to think in SQL to write good SQL. Bad SQL can be very inefficient. One cause is trying to think procedurally. Loop over each record and do this. Within that loop, find all related records, and do that with them. Etc. You can't do that in SQL and expect efficiency. Learn to think in sets and subsets. Learn to write sub-selects where a table name would appear in FROM. Learn to JOIN multiple sub-selects. Learn to write an aggregate function (or a SELECT of an aggregate function over some set of related rows) in the place where output columns go right after the word SELECT prior to FROM. And much more. Bad O/R map usage. Suppose PO (purchase order) has a map of a collection of OrderLine. You load the PO object, or a collection of List&lt;PO&gt;. Then on some subsequent operation over that collection of PO, you access the order lines of a PO. Since you didn't fetch-join the order lines on the original query to get the POs, then each access of order lines on each PO results in the O/R mapper (eg, Hibernate for instance) making another trip to the database server to grab the order lines for that PO. So if I'm looking at 100 POs, this is a total of 101 queries. 1 for the PO, and 1 for each of the 100 sets of order lines on each PO. If the original query for the PO had fetch-joined the order lines, then this all would have come back in the original query. One thing about database servers, it takes a LOT more time to do a query than the processing of the query takes. For instance, a million queries fetching one row each may take many minutes. One query fetching a million rows might take ten milliseconds. Really. There can be other O/R mapper problems, but what I described, the n+1 query problem is a common one. Thread starvation means you either have too many threads, or not enough processors, or some combination. Hope that helps. 
So far i have not seen /r/javahelp question unanswered.
There are occasional ones left unanswered. But that's mostly because these questions either ask for homework to be done, or are so badly formulated that no one can make sense out of them. Commonly, the community is very helpful and open. (Provided people follow the rules.)
Exactly, those either aren't questions, or are questions for full solution instead of help.
Set it up just as a server. Tech clicks a button on a site and it says he's busy. Store the current value in a db or even just in memory. Who cares. You display another page on the site that shows who's busy. Status page can periodically poll, or you can get fancy and use long polling or web sockets for realtime push. Easy peasy. 
&gt; Since servlets are stateless, aren't they designed to be this way from the start? Session information. Servlets may take advantage of a feature that allows attaching Java objects to the session. The server (eg, Tomcat or other) sends the browser a session cookie (or uses other mechanism) to associate a particular visitor's activity with the objects that servlets stored on the session. As soon as your servlets use session information, they aren't really stateless. When the servlet gets invoked from a particular visitor, the servlet can ask the container for any of the objects it previously stored in the session, and get back the objects associated with that visitor. Other web back end technologies will have similar mechanisms. For instance in PHP you can easily store session information. As I wrote elsewhere in this thread, if you must use session information at all, keep it to a minimum, and store it somewhere accessible to all of your servers. That way you really can just spin up more servers. Ideally don't use session information at all. Everything needed to service an incoming http request should be available from the database. If your system has something like a login table of user accounts, you would somehow need to associate the currently logged in user with the http session. The easy way is to store a key value, or an object describing the logged in user -- but then you have the problem mentioned above. Another way would be to have a cache server, or maybe a NoSQL server that has a simple map of session id to user account. This would then move the association out of the application servers into another central location shared between all of the application servers (eg, Tomcat servers for example). 
"The thing about standards is that there are so many to choose from!" Java has some of this in the "unofficial frameworks realm" But, there are so many other reasons to switch off of PHP, you touched on them in your last paragraph. My experience, like yours, with a most php programmers is that they are glorified HTML slingers and aren't accustomed to making things sensibly. It takes a person going through a lot of chaff to be able to find those that leverage frameworks and way too much chaff to find those that can author them.
In terms of a friendly community, I get the impression that .NET wins here. I'm not particularly a .NET person (I'm on the Java side), but it always seemed to me they were "nicer". On the Java side, for example, you have the ##java irc channel @ irc.freenode.com. It's probably one of the most hostile channels on freenode. It could be an IRC thing, but I think it's worth pointing out. The whole notion of "proper OOP" I think is also an issue in the Java community. You still see people (although not many) arguing that design patterns applications is just bad design, and that someone should never ever need/use getters and setters, and so forth. Silly (IMO silly) OO arguments aside, Java makes it way easier to not write OO code IMO. You can way to easily make objects depend on too many concrete classes, not adhering to the principle that objects should only know what services (i.e. messages) other objects respond to. More specifically, that objects shouldn't depend on how other objects are implemented, represented, constructed, come into existence, etc. It's way too easy to violate that, and there is considerable "pain" in making a Java program adhere to this principle. And you'll still hear C and/or C++ programmers who have no clue of performance (but think they do because they program in C and/or in C++) saying that Java is slow. =D As a final note... I imagine this won't be much of a problem to you because PHP is also full of frameworks. But to program in Java server side applications professionally, you'll probably have to learn a lot of stuff besides Java. There are frameworks for everything, libraries, annotations processors, tools of all sorts, IDE's are really huge, etc. It's almost as if java was "this tiny little detail in the corner".
Don't use Swing. First of all, it's outdated and second, it needs a lot more work than a web app.
Classical job for a web application. It's fast and simple to implement these requirements. You could write a simple HTML/CSS/JS frontend and have a REST backend in Java which handles the requests and persists the status. Or you could use any framework you like, e.g. JSF. The technology behind doesn't really matter. You will need a running server and a database. Ask me, if you need further help.
Welcome to the wonderful world of language politics. Looks like you found a group with a noble idea but with members who won't practice what they preach. The group itself won't ever do anything to correct it because the major projects are what lends the group its credibility to people who only take the time to look at the brochure. So you got a catch-22 situation: You can choose to associate with a group that only pays lip service to the standards they produce, or you can challenge the members who are obviously there for marketing reasons and be ostracized for questioning the motives of a member that the group desperately needs to be associated with. You could take the high road and follow the standard and lead by example, or you could move on to a different community that may be more mature. Looks like you chose the best solution for yourself, because really who has time for that BS? One important lesson that YOU should take away with this is that not all rules are meant to be enforced in such a draconian manor. Nothing is black or white, there are many shades of gray. There may have been legitimate reasons for not complying with all of the standards, but that still doesn't justify the reactions to your concerns. They could have simply said that new code will conform to the standards and that would be good enough for everyone. You asking for the entire code base to be rewritten just to satisfy a standard was asking too much. Also attacking your project logo sounds pretty silly. 
Why does it need to be software? Wouldn't turning on an indicator light or flipping some kind of card do the job faster and with less overhead? Edit ... If they use lync or some other online messaging app they could set their status to available or do-not-disturb.… no need to reinvent the wheel.
There's [jsoup](http://jsoup.org/), if you want to parse html. It has selectors much like jquery does. Either that or just plain old grep should work.
The kicker is that they started work on a new major version of their CMS half a yer ago after coming up with the code style. The major version was a total rewrite and was just released yesterday with some totally new standard.
Thanks )
A week or so I did a bit of trolling. I had come across this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/2hbh9g/is_it_a_pattern_if_so_which_dont_upvote/ And I thought it was fascinating to watch the terminology slung around, but it seems like there was little agreement ( meaning understanding ) of what meant what. I did participate a bit. But, I also thought, perhaps java would be the same. So I posted what I tried to make as an identical question to java: http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/2hdoly/is_this_a_pattern_if_so_which/ I'll let you draw conclusions. 
The big three are eclipse, intellij idea and netbeans. Eclipse is most widely used but all have pros, cons, and very vocal followers. All are free or have free versions.
[Netbeans](http://www.netbeans.org) kicks butt. Also, 100% free.
IntelliJ IDEA is a fantastic IDE, and while I don't know any other languages I've heard great things about the other JetBrains products. From what I've heard, IDEA even has decent Eclipse plugin support.
This made my evening =))) I would suggest posing both links back to /r/php for some level2 trolling 
I've been using Eclipse professionally for 8 years now and I have little interest in using anything else on a daily basis. Though it does have its frustrating moments and there are other tools that may suit your situation just as well or better. There is a huge community of support for Eclipse and it's free. I've used a host of MS Visual suites over the years for other languages, but I'd prefer to develop in Eclipse. YMMV. 
if you're a beginner, I recommend using eclipse solely because educational media tends to be taught with eclipse. Personally I prefer Intellij IDEA but most mainstream IDEs are good as well.
I know you asked about community, but community and code/libraries/frameworks are related. There are certainly plenty of "free to play" propositions within java land. Most of them are of the "here's the code, if you want additional features or consulting to use this we can help you for a fee" Since java is far more performant than PHP, and has better tooling, it's the go-to language for huge projects which very large companies depend on for their core business. So there is quite a bit more money available for the key projects than there is with PHP. I think that translates to MORE free projects and more support in terms of contributors for free projects. There are also several different "ecosystems" within java. There is the JBoss crew, The Swing crew, The IBM crew, The Oracle crew. They both compete with and attempt to cooperate with each other. WRT Jumping. There are tons of MVC style frameworks on java. From super heavyweight to pretty lightweight. So if your goal is to replicate pixie you may find yourself swimming with the big fish. However if your goal is to become a great java programmer, I think you will find yourself much happier in java land. That said, java is old, and has it's design deficiencies. Perhaps skipping java for scala or haskell ? Honestly java will be easier with more money in the short run. Those others you might learn more.
Netbeans is a cool IDE as long as you don't work with GUI. Even though the GUI Builder is quite decent and easy to use, it obfuscates too much code and makes it too difficult to change anything in the GUI code.
IntelliJ Idea is probably my preferred one. It's also free for students now.
Because XML was once overhyped and one feels the need to overcompensate.
Netbeans
If my work didn't require Eclipse for plug ins and stuff, I'd use IntelliJ in a heartbeat. It's got weird project setups, but really nice language-assist features. If you've ever heard of ReSharper, same company.
It's a text-based data structure format like anything else. Like JSON. Both have trade-offs. :) Still, admittedly, I do like going back to code roots when instructions are modelled using an interpreter. You're deferring responsibility on an interpreted pseudo language. Not great for debugging. 
That sound like an Map stored in a memory map file. I think Peter Lawreys https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Map would do that.
indeed! being xml free is not the most valuable feature. Personally i don't care but the java ecosystem is nowadays escaping xml configuration as much as possible. Standard APIs are moving toward annotated POJOs and making xml descriptors optional because, we must admit, xml is verbose and can become really annoying is large code bases. Anyway, I am not going to reopen the endless XML vs @ debate, but I do believe that Easy Rules may provide the ability to define rules in XML and let the user choose between @, xml or java based configuration.
I much, much, *much* prefer the netbeans GUI builder to WindowBuilder. WindowBuilder is a horrible unusable trainwreck IMHO. I get why people wouldn't like the netbeans GUI builder, but I still think it's the best of the bunch.
I'm going to be that guy. If you're learning Java an ide is only going to confuse you. Ide's have several thousand features. Your only going to be using 2, compile and run. You're going to be writing lots of short programs not large projects. All these extra project steps and files will just add to the barriers of learning. Just grab notepad++ open a command prompt, use Javac to compile and just Java to run and your good to go. 
annotations :-)
BlueJ makes sense for beginners, since you can try out code easily in it. Once you have experience, you can switch to any of the big 3 IDEs (Eclipse, IntelliJ, Netbeans). They all provide similar features, so you shouldn't worry too much which you use. Though if you're going to be doing any Android development, you might as well go with IntelliJ. 
.net and python have the most noob friendly communities. Java used to be better, but the huge number of homework questions posted to forums soured many. The ruby communities have way too much dick measuring. They are OK to new users but could be a lot nicer. Smalltalk and lisp have the most noob hostile communities. 
Some of the ejb2 code I've seen could cause brain hemorrhaging if you didn't take precautions before check out.
Thanks, I haven't seen this before, but sadly no. If I needed something like this, I think I would go with Hazelcast, but there seems to be plenty of choices out there for distributed in-memory caches. This doesn't address the automatic synchronization between Java entity POJOs and an underlying map instance. Thanks for the input, I think I'll have to roll my own using CGLib. In fact I already started, I don't think it should take very long anyway.
Not to be nitpicky here but 4 million nanoseconds are 4 milliseconds, not 0.004 milliseconds.
I recommend Netbeans. You can install it with a configured Web application server by running a simple .exe file. In addition the tutorials from the website are simple and a great way to get started. www.netbeans.org I have not used IntelliJ so I cannot say anything there. Stay away from Eclipse. It is a monster. Everywhere I have used it people need a bunch of plugins and other configuration to get it up and running. It also has a strange interface called perspectives which can be confusing. It is powerful and very customizable though.
Code quality is really up to the developer. I seen code quality in Perl that can induce an immediate brain aneurism. I've seen the same in Python recently. It took autopep8 and some major rewrite to make it sane again. 
Netbeans. It's a complete turnkey solution that get's you started on learning Java quickly and easily. Tutorials from Oracle make use of Netbeans, so that's a plus. Once you get familiar with the language, you can try out the other two to see if they offer what you need.
My personal choice is also intellij. I was weary of the cost at first but it's worth every penny. The seamless integration with popular tools make me wonder why I didn't leave eclipse sooner.
I will be more of that guy. If you're learning to program, Java and notepad are too high level and will probably just confuse you. Just grab an IBM 701 system and some punch cards and focus on the stuff that really matters.
the problem with a shared memory server is, having to run an extra server at all times. who knows if you'll only get 4-5 visitors of 10k visitors. so if you end up getting 4-5 visitors, then you have an additional server running for no reason. so storing the sessions in db seems to be a better option. 
For beginners, the free CE will suffice.
Thank you so much haha there are lots of great responses in this thread, which sadly I do not have time to respond to all of them, but I think this is what I was looking for. The IDEs I have used before have been extremely confusing. Just to make sure I understand this correctly. I write the code in a text editor and save it as a .java file. Then I use Javac to compile it from the cmd, right? And after compiling it I can simply run the code and see if it worked or not?
Haha I'm not looking to learn hardware dependent and tedious languages. I have a better than average grasp on how logic gates work and how the CPU executes machine set instructions and I am not looking to further my knowledge there atm. I learned all of that theory when I learned computer hardware and PC repair, I just never took the time to learn to program before.
The solution to the O/R problem is to do a @FetchType(Greedy) or equivalent?
&gt; a simple map of session id to user account. the session id would be stored as a cookie on the user's end in this case?
You're right - I was converting to seconds in my head, whoops. Will fix.
NetBeans is connected to SceneBuilder for JavaFX , making GUI building with JavaFX quite a bit easier
Also importing and loads of small checks like line terminators , proper package names etc...
Netbeans or Eclipse are the best option for Java. Both are free.
BlueJay also forces you to learn a lot more, since it doesn't try to intelllisense code for you.
That would be pretty difficult without proper content type headers. I mean look at these two links: http://i.imgur.com/oVDhxP9.jpg and http://i.imgur.com/blog.jpg Same structure but one is an image, and one isn't.
Build something. It doesn't matter what it is. Have a task that you do every day? Try to automate it. If you get stuck, google around for the answer. You have no idea how much you will learn by going into "just do it" mode.
+1 for jGrasp. I think modern IDEs are a crutch with their intellisense. I find that I learn a lot better when I have to retype out everything 50 times, instead of having the intellisense finish off all my lines of code.
Use JavaFx with Scenebuilder. Makes GUI soooo much easier. 
IntelliJ IDEA, no doubts about it
We don't need any community any more, since we have stackoverflow.com :)
I totally disagree with this notion. START with an IDE. The learning curve for the first day or so WILL be steeper. But java is a language which THRIVES in tools. If you are using vi or notepad you will begin to wonder why you have to type so much. more than any other language the tools are at least as important as the language itself. Frankly, java would be a sucky language without the tools. Let me take that back. Spend 1 hour without an IDE. write your first "hello world!". use vi/notepad javac and java to do so. THEN go to an IDE.
Start with this article: http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/03/di-containers-are-evil.html It explains why you should NOT learn DI.
I disagree completely. At the very least, you need something with code completion and a tool that lets you see what methods / fields are available. Starting off in notepad is a great way to depress yourself and waste weeks of your life.
I love Java. Really deeply. I am such a fanboy that I've been able to bring entire companies to see things my way, by sheer persistence of enthusiasm. Java + GUI = bad time. One must have patience. One must be committed. One must have a big plan and a strong will. Unchain java from the dumbness of the user and the necessity to pamper to his quirky whims and you can be a dragon, or a dragon slayer, whatever is your pleasure.
I started in BlueJ and recommend it for beginners. It is designed for and caters to just beginners. Actually, a friend of mine was using it three years in CS classes.
Good excuse to learn to read documentation http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/
The good thing about IDEs is that they all work somewhat the same. Once you learn an IDE, you can try another one and maybe notice something you like about that one etc. Don't get stuck on choosing the 'right' one, focus on learning programming. If BlueJ feels ok for now, stick with it while you learn the basics of Java, you can always change later on. It should be good a beginner IDE, since it is specifically designed for learning programming. I got started with regular notepad, later moved to Netbeans, tried IntelliJ and currently using primarily Eclipse. I use Eclipse since it has got a lot of advanced feature and is completely free. My employer also uses it. I would not recommend it to beginners though, since it's not really beginner friendly. Netbeans is probably the one I would recommend to a beginner, since it is pretty user friendly and also supports advanced features later on. Using an IDE with all the projects with classes etc. might be confusing at first, but it will help you a lot with frustrating and simple errors like missing a semi-colon or typos. Got close to losing my sanity while writing Java without an IDE :), so I would not recommend skipping IDEs. I do however recommend trying to compile-run a program from command prompt a few times, just so that you understand why and how it's done.
I remember being confused the first time I tried to write and run Java, compared to what I was most used to (Perl and PHP) and even compared to compiled languages like C. I had to grok namespaces/packages, the corresponding directory structure, and both a compiler and virtual machine (e.g. why do I put my java files in slash/separated/directories and run class files from dot.seperated.packages?). Of course IDEs were shit back then, but stick with it, it all makes pretty good sense in the end.
I don't have experience with rule engines, but this seems like an anti-pattern to me. The @Condition and @Action methods by definition have to have access to state external to themselves to be useful. Wouldn't something like: class Foo&lt;A, B&gt; { @Test public boolean test(A a) { // evaluate T to see if it meets the condition. } @Apply public B apply(A a) { // process A and turn it into B } } Be more functional? 
We use Lync at work and it's perfect for this situation
Look at what you did, OP took you seriously.
Yes.
I have IntelliJ Ultimate (paid version) which includes support for all web stuff including JavaScript, css, sass, grunt, html, xml you name it. All of them work great. Excellent integration with git, maven, gradle all out of the box.
Ummm of course lol From a CS standpoint it is an excellent idea to learn machine language, though maybe not with punch cards :P
Netbeans or eclispe
talk about throwing rocks at the beehive...... Not for me. I'm happy to run the experiment, but I don't want to disabuse people of the notion that you can do EVERYTHING in php. If someone hasn't figured it out, then I don't need to help them. FWIW, I do use PHP. but only when I know the code base will never exceed a single file and performance is a non-issue. It's great for that! I use Java, Python, Ruby, and Scala (a bit) I try not to be a language bigot. But project's like Symfony are just amazing to me. It's like they're trying to re-create the entirety of Spring+Hibernate. Why ? It performs like shit. It's got real "break shit" code inside comments (an attempt at annotations ). It is easily as complicated as a full enterprisey server-side java app. Installing it runs you into reams of problems with external C libs. it's mind blowing. If people like it, fine. But if they're too narrow minded to see that perhaps this is using the wrong tool to solve their problem then I'll let them "enjoy" it. So no, I'm not going to do a second level troll. 
You have to weep for a language where typing the same code 50 times considered learning.
The sweet thing about the big IDEs is that they catch the misspelled words and case sensitivity errors that can make a beginner go crazy. I learned java using jgrasp and switching to eclipse was like having sex without a condom for the first time. Having that said, I like to write C with command line vim because I feel like a man. 
I believe that a debugger is absolutely critical for learning what a piece of code does. This is even more important for beginners. Your code is not going to work perfectly the first time. Stepping through line by line watching things change is the best way to gain understanding.
I also disagree, but for a different reason: at the very least you need a debugger.
Jetbrains is currently giving students a free (one year) license with a .edu email account to all of their paid IDE, including my favorite Java IDE, IDEA Ultimate Edition, which I use because of Spring, Groovy, Hibernate, and Database features not available in the Community Edition, which you should also look at if you don't need those things because it is free. http://www.jetbrains.com/student/ Ignore the features you don't need, use the ones you do, learn new things as you go. You can't beat an IDE for debugging.
IntelliJ is nice. My issue with all the Java IDEs though has always been that they're big, confusing, and slow/unresponsive pretty often. Eclipse grinds to a halt constantly. I think for a real beginner though, when you're writing simple "hello, world" programs and sorting arrays and things like that, it's not a bad idea to just write the code in notepad++ or vim or something, learn how to manually do all the ceremonious declaring of "public class This" and "public static void main(string[] args){} and whatnot.
Awful. The worst java spring code I ever saw was a god object that I dubbed the pantheon because of the huge number of inner classes. Naming everything service is the hot new anti pattern. 
Make an array of an array and store the values of the indexes multiplied.
Can you be a bit more specific about which part are you having trouble with? The `for` loops or using Formatter ?
Mostly the for loops!
/u/AldousP Was joking :)
While I *want* to agree with you... Java's package structure makes it so that as soon as you get beyond Hello World, you will *have* to have an IDE. Specifying classpaths, importing jar files, identifying the main class buried in a 5-layer deep package structure, etc. is absolute hell from the command line. I like the idea of a simple editor and command line for beginners to help them appreciate certain aspects of the language/platform, but for Java, it's just not practical for anything more than a 100% trivial program.
Java in mainstream/enterprise and legacy systems, Go is doing an expressive job in many neat projects, like Docker, and javascript with Node.js, has proving to be capable to simplify the heterogeneous, multi devices and realtime requirements for apps today. 
For the inner matrix you can do something like: private int[][] fillMatrix(int rows, int cols) { int[][] matrix = new int[rows][cols]; int counter = 0; for (int i = 0; i &lt; rows; i++) { for (int j = 0; j &lt; cols; j++) { matrix[i][j] = ++counter; } } return matrix; } The rest is formatting.
So true about ##java.
The two big free "IDEs" are Eclipse and NetBeans. There are other IDEs but I'm assuming you want something that is completely free since you are a beginner. Both are popular but you spend more time customizing Eclipse with plugins, it is great that it is so flexible but a little overwhelming for a beginner. NetBeans always seems more feature complete out of the box and typically supports the latest versions of Java SE/EE the soonest. There are less plugins for NetBeans but I find I don't need plugins for it as much. Honestly once you learn one of them it doesn't take that much to learn the other. I'd recommend you start with NetBeans and later also learn Eclipse. Another option is to just use a text editor that as some Java features like color syntax highlighting. Try jEdit. You start with learning how to run java and javac on the command line and just using jEdit to edit the source code. As you learn more there are jEdit plugin to add features like buttons to compile and project support. 
Eclipse, mate it might be a little extra learning, but its worth it, cause in the end you will end up using it anyways. I started with absolutely 0 experience in programming, installing Eclipse was ground breaking stuff. Today I can say i understand enough about programming to say I have basic literacy and coding ability with Java, purely by finding a project, reading a book about programming (many is better, as it read about the same thing from a few similar perspectives, helps teach the abstractness), and just programming. I found the eclipse functions (like auto complete, reformatting (renaming basically), occasional hints to errors, error checking, debugger) really helpful. Plus most resources I have seen use Eclipse or Netbeens (I think that is what it was/is). They also used it seems in industry and startup, so why not. http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ IntelliJ IDEA seems also popular, and free for students
Does IntelliJ have something unique and helpful for android? I'm interested in starting with android development. Edit: are you serious? Can whoever is down voting me please tell me why you would downvote a legitimate question about something?
With regards to the confusing projects/naming conventions problem: I would recommend finding a good text editor, not an IDE. I find the simplest way to program is to write code how I deem it logical, not according to a "project," and then compile it and run it my self in a shell. IDEs give you so many options that people often drown. Text editor: I recommend zed. It's clean and elegant and fast. Also it gets you away from the mouse for a while. www.zedapp.org If you do want to know my recommendation for an IDE, I like NetBeans, myself.
Are you talking about a debugger? That allows you to step through every instruction.
My CC class on java focused solely on Netbeans but I used eclipse throughout the entire class. Once you realize how little most of the new project stuff matters in the scope of simple programs it doesnt matter so much which ide you use just how you initially set it up.
Not that this matters at all, but it would be easier to decompress the jre and use a search function via the command line.
OP should learn how to use the debugger! So useful especially with difficult bugs. 
Currently IntelliJ is the base for the next android studio.
Speaking of Android, I've just started using Android Studio and I love it. It was easier to set up than eclipse, and had easy git integration. Auto complete, intellisense, and import management are all superb so far. Also, I highly recommend getting yourself some version control for when your experiments need to be rolled back to that great time when it actually compiled. Github is free if you're cool with open source, only $7/month for 5 private repositories, I think.
Hearsay!!! FTFY
.Net may be nicer to people, but I have found them to be very close minded and venomous towards other technologies. The more ingrained the .Net developer is, the more they hate everything not Microsoft. MS is God to some of them. I actually had a meeting the other day with the .Net team and one of them laughed that I used Google Chrome for development. "Google. HA! pft" ...he seriously said that... I mean, I love .Net though. I started as a .Net developer and you're right about the newbie friendliness and them being generally friendly towards people. C# is a way better language than Java, but I love the Java ecosystem. The openness, the sharing, the innovation, and everything else. It's a very different community. Plus, I'm a pretty big Linux fan. I'd say the worst thing about Java that you hit on in your last paragraph and the OP mentions is that there are sooooooooo many choices for freaking everything. To a point lots of choices are a good thing. But the Java world is like the guy who told the really funny joke, but kept going for 10minutes after everyone quit laughing. If you opt for a 3rd party, you need to spend more time researching it and making sure that it's a good fit. Sometimes you can end up down a very poorly implemented and poorly documented path if you choose the wrong thing. I'm kind of a vocal PHP hater, but I mostly just really dislike it. I can find some good parts in it and I actually find it to be a very useful little scripting language. But one of the Java frameworks we use is [Wicket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Wicket) and I fucking **HATE** Wicket. I hate everything about it, it's probably the worst most convoluted piece of shit I've ever had to touch in my career. It's also poorly documented and poorly supported, which makes it hard as hell to work with. Edit: Also about the communities. I have never seen any as bad as PHP. If you take all the bad parts of all the developer/language communities out there and threw them together, you'd have the PHP community. 
Using a debugger to find a crash can be useful outside of the stack dump you get but the debugger's power lies in finding out why your code produced the wrong output, which doesn't necessarily mean it crashed. Variables can be changed in ways you didn't intend or maybe you just have a logic error. That is the true power of the debugger, in my opinion.
For what it's worth, I remember one of the OP's posts from /r/webdev and followed it to PHP just to read the comments. [It was this post](http://phpixie.com/blog/things-a-web-developer-should-be-able-to-grasp-part-2/) where he outlined some pretty basic things you should expect **any** college graduate to have a pretty good understanding of. Even the Business focused Computer Science classes like BIS/MIS or IT, because it's mostly Sophomore level coursework at that. My favorite comment on the thread was this: &gt;I would start calling one who understand this a (Senior) Software Engineer. So according to him, and at least the 5 people who upvoted him, a mediocre fresh college grad should be promoted to senior after about 6 months on the job learning PHP. 
I've hung out on #java and never had any issues. Asked questions and got answers immediately + friendly. I don't know what you're talking about.
PHP is literally a pile of dogshit, from the language to the community to the jobs. Source: 6 years of PHP development before moving to java. First, the language is full of lol + bullshit that makes me want to vomit. I used to think PHP was fine, but its only because I wasn't exposed to any other options. After learning java, I've never wanted to touch any PHP code again. Then, the community has all those issues you mentioned, plus a lot of the jobs are just bullshit 'slice psd into html, make me a custom wordpress site', etc. There's almost never any interesting PHP jobs. You never get hired to build something involving A.I or financial analysis, or pretty much anything interesting. Then, the code quality of other developers is really shit, because PHP encourages a culture of bad code and attracts bad developers, who don't change their habits. Move to another language, and you'll maintain your sanity and hate PHP just as much as I do now, after 6 years of working in it and still having to sometimes use it to maintain legacy projects. P.S /r/lolphp is a great subreddit.

I wasn't talking about storage at all. I was talking about mapping. What I need is the infrastructure that maps entities _into_ and _back from_ the map. Again, not the map itself, but the infrastructure for seamless and efficient translation. I never said that ehcache was complicated, I said it was complicated for what I need it to do (my storage environment really shouldn't matter as far as I'm concerned).
Although having re-read my initial description, I see how people got that impression. Sorry about that.
I am. I use the debugger and errors, but I want to see the theory. I am very visual.
define **theory**
If you create a flyweight object using unsafe to read/write from the off heap memory - you can look at https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding for example of that - then you don't have the serialization issue. but that's not trivial. But unless you do that there is always a sync issue.
No need to access any external state, the rule should encapsulate behaviour and state to operate on (like any object in OO programming). Here is an example: @Rule public class MyRule { private BusinessData myBusinessData; //data to operate on //constructor or setter for business data @Condition public boolean when() { //my rule conditions on business data (ex : person.getAge() &gt; 18 ) return true; } @Action(order = 1) public void then() { //my actions on business data (ex: person.setAdult(true) ) } @Action(order = 2) public void after() { //my next void actions (ex : send email, write data to output stream, etc) } } Rules are in fact more object oriented than functional.
Nah I think that award should go to builder pattern abuse.
Maybe you are looking for something like [jGrasp](http://www.jgrasp.org) or [BlueJ](http://www.bluej.org/)?
Do you want the byte code? Or documentation on how the compiler turns the Java code into byte code?
I always suggest to use eclipse. At this point of time any IDE offers you same thing. But when you are mastering IDE, Eclipse is worth to consider. That plugin development, modelling and graphical editor are fun to explore. Since Eclipse is open source, at this point of time, you might not get very help. For me,IDE is always Eclipse.
The loop you wrote is what is executed, with the exception of for:each loops, which are converted to an iterator and a while loop. A debugger will allow you to follow the code through the loop, if that's what you mean.
Then you probably have Java installed somewhere else. Open up the `cmd.exe` and hit `java -version` or `echo %JAVA_HOME%`. If both of these show something meaningful, you still have it installed.
Try Jackson. It is a pojo to json Mapper but can map to Maps and Lists as well. 
this is the answer i have: windows cannot find 'java' Make sure you have typed it correctly, and then try again. which is fine, I don't think I need it. 
Precisely, I rather think it crazy for them to ask to install a tool bar, which i don't do but, i figured if a program needs it it will ask. 
The download page for [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) says 10.5 or late required so the latest version should be okay. The problem is presumably the lack of a JDK or Eclipse's inability to locate it? If so you may want to check this solution on [stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19563766/eclipse-kepler-for-os-x-mavericks-request-java-se-6/19594116#19594116).
Thanks
Use it all the time for interacting with external dependencies - I don't want to use their wire types in my APIS and likely have a more specific use case than what their API provides. Arguably that's more of the Facade pattern, though? 
I'm not the quickest person, so I know there are people who deserved senior status far before I thought I deserved it. But yeah, there is some serious "grade inflation" going on in the industry these days. At least in the Bay Area, I think companies are promoting people to senior so they can justify paying them more so that they can keep them from jumping ship.
its a title. its given by the employer. the employee needs to know/experience whatever the employer deems appropriate
Mentoring someone junior with measurable growth. Successfully selling your technical ideas to other developers and non technical business stakeholders. Be an interviewer for developers and make good hiring decisions.
A senior developer should have the confidence to say "I don't know". If I throw a ridiculously complex problem at a Junior person, nine times out of ten they will start spouting off about some random thing that is of no consequence. The answer I'd rather hear is "I don't know, but I could research it and get back to you". As the years have rolled on, the trait I admire most in a developer is the ability to accept where their skill set ends and continuously strive to improve. It doesn't help anybody to grasp at straws. You don't have to know everything, but you have to know enough to recognize and acknowledge a gap in your skills. Doesn't mean you won't ever have the answer, just that it's OK not to have the answer right now.
From the book: "**Understanding Technology for the Busy HR Professional**" on this exact question, of how to recognize a senior: "**Senior Level** A senior-level resource needs to have the confident package of experience and, generally, the ability to describe why they chose to implement a particular solution. So, when you assess a senior-level developer, you should expect them to tell you why they do things a certain way. You should focus on why questions and the tech leads who sit in on the interview will need to assess the validity of their answers. Another important point here is assessing their grasp of the domain--or the specific business area in which they worked. So, putting those two elements together, you first ask: tell me about a project you worked on. You pose that question only to get them on the record with the name of some technology XYZ that they used. Next, the important question, you ask them: Why did you choose to solve your problem with technology XYZ? Things to be on guard for here: it's possible for an unmotivated developer to become a senior merely by holding a job for a long time. They kept a seat warm long enough that they slowly became a senior. This kind of candidate may reveal their lack of drive or motivation by revealing that someone else did the planning for them. If you suspect they were a long-term drone who did what they were told by someone else, you can come out and ask: Did you mostly work on projects that were planned by an architect, and then you had to follow their design? If you believe based on their answer or their hemming-and hawing that they were a drone, then you need to assess the role that you are trying to fill. Will it be necessary for the developer to think on their own? Do you want someone who will work independently? Or, will they be taking direction from another, more senior developer? Drone developers in this situation often get flushed out and leave the business. A senior developer is asked to do a lot of thinking and if they're incapable of doing so, they generally crash and burn. More likely, you will see a senior as an experienced developer who is proud of the projects they worked on and who will try to emphasize that they designed solutions that they implemented by themselves. Assuming that their ego doesn't get in the way, these are usually your best candidates. They can solve nearly any problem and they are willing to learn and take pride in the solutions they have designed and built. A senior-level developer will need to pick technologies, design solutions and implement them, solving all the problems that arise along the way. Don't be satisfied with less. Tip: *Look for a senior candidate to explain why they chose a particular solution. Look for senior developers who have designed the solutions they built and who didn't just take orders from someone higher up--unless that's what you're looking for.* **Architect** When you have a candidate who is applying for the exalted architect-level position, then you need to understand that an architect is really a senior-level developer who also has significant and relevant domain experience, and a talent for devising entire solution stacks. There's that word: stack. When a developer mentions a technology stack, what mean is a collection of technologies that work as a unit. The entire package: soup to nuts. From a crowd of senior-level developers, you only want to tap one to be the architect when they demonstrate that they understand the business rules that underlie the solutions they will devise, and can devise and design collections of technologies to get that job done. An architect is a senior developer with relevant experience and the imagination to build big solutions around technologies. Additionally, any architect candidate must be able to verbally describe what they are working on. Since architects will be creating designs that will be fleshed out by other developers, clear and effective communication should be one of their top skills. Their communication skills should impress you. Any architect candidate who does not wow you with their ability to clearly communicate should be passed over. Every senior-level developer pines to be an architect and many might succeed at it. Your task is to weed out senior-level developers who lack domain experience or who are lazy or who can't communicate what they've designed and why. Tip: *Look for an architect candidate who can freely explain their domain experience. Look for architect-level candidates who are excellent communicators. Be on guard for candidates who can talk without actually saying anything meaningful. Avoid candidates who don't grasp the entire technology package--or stack. You will need to rely on other developers to make this sort of high-level decision.*"
For those of you recommending Vim/Emacs/other plain text editor: I do 100% of my engineering in Vim, but I write in Ruby professionally. For Java I'd eschew a plain text editor and use IntelliJ IDEA. Because Java is statically typed and compiled using an IDE like IntelliJ can provide powerful code analysis and refactoring tools. I found IntelliJ to be beginner friendly too :)
I want to see step 1-whatever to highlight as it executes in the code so I can learn how the theory works.
Interesting and a little useful, but still from the perspective of people without domain knowledge. 
Do you happen to have the ISDN or the full title and author of this book? It sounds spot on for our HR department but I've Googled every combination I can think of from the words "Understanding technology for the busy HR Professional" with no luck?
