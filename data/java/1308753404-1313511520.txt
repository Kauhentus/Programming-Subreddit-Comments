you're right, the good people at Apache know what they're doing, it's probably better to use their implementation of `getopt` for production use.
With a C++ background I can strongly recommend "[Thinking in Java](http://mindview.net/Books/TIJ4)" by Bruce Eckel. While he doesn't assume prior OOP knowledge and the book starts a little slow, I really like how he often compares features between Java and C++ or sometimes other languages (e.g. he discusses Java Generics vs. C++ Templates, Java vs. C++ contructors, ...). As a bonus, the first few chapters are available online.
@speek, i'm not interested in a debate here, i'm just trying to give some advice to someone who i assume is a power-user. they tend to be familiar with the command line, and they tend to find Eclipse/Netbeans to be rather poor. when a `pom.xml` is present (which the 5 min tutorial generates), you don't have to do anything in terms of external dependencies, i doubt a `hello world` project would depend on tons of libraries, but if it did **maven** would certainly build whatever you needed, which is pretty good. **good** you give your advice, i give my advice, @p222 can figure out which advice he wants to follow... **bad** i give my advice, you start debating whether or not Ecplise is a good IDE
*Not* buying Sun was the biggest mistake Google has made to date.
That your advice was terrible is the whole of it. So terrible I thought you were trolling. 
Seriously I am not even going to read the article with a title like that. Anybody actually working as a software engineer knows that EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS is written in Java or COBOL. All of you government's software systems, most of your bank's system, most of your insurance's systems, most of the postal/logistics systems. There are the things that keep the world turning and Java is fucking KING there. This will not change. Twitter does NOT MATTER. Even Facebook DOES NOT MATTER. The system that says if you have paid your insurance/taxes/etc. those are the ones that matter.
Sounds like they're going to be footing the bill anyway.
I wonder if Oracle is hurting for money and that's why they are suing the big G
Oracle is not hurting for money. See their balance sheet: http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:ORCL&amp;fstype=ii Last quarter they made a total of $8,764,000,000 (8.7 billion) with $2,116,000,000 in Net Income ($2.1 billion). They have $24 billion in cash in the bank, and $67 billion in total assets. By comparison Google made $8.5 billion last quarter with $1.79 billion in Net Income. They have $36 billion in the bank and $60 billion in total assets. They are suing Google to knock a competitor out and to make more money.
[java.util.Calendar](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html) or [JodaTime](http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/) or [JSR-310](http://threeten.sourceforge.net/).
JodaTime is quite excellent, I recommend it.
JodaTime it is 
But they are not actually in the same business segment... Unless Larry wants to help Steve.
Thank you for posting your code. Seeing it, and observing the responses was a gigantic help to me. I wish there was an /r/codereview or something.
np
That would indeed be nice. It'd be a huge amount of work though. Every major browser right now is either 10+ years old or based on a stack that is. Re: your first con. &gt; 1) it would be a memory hog. My current firefox instance has more than 700MB in it's working set. I don't even have that many tabs open right now. 
The closest thing that I know of is [Lobo](http://lobobrowser.org/java-browser.jsp), and it's not keeping up with HTML5 yet. It does do some of the things I mention, such as making Java code and JavaFX code equal citizens to HTML, and a plugin architecture aka eclipse. It has the right ideas and direction, but lacks resources to keep up with firefox and google.
Yep, we use JodaTime extensively as well. java.util.Calendar sucks eggs.
@speek, contribute! give us some good advice, because i don't think you are going to convince me that i give terrible advice, after all they are **my** advice.. i have a few years of teaching experience, and i know what people from other languages tend to love/hate about Java, and i'm a big fan of the language so i try to point people away from stuff which is broken. i'm all ears.. 
I gave the advice already. You downvoted it. You expect me to continue with you?
As many people as there are wanting to learn java it would be extremely helpful
you didn't mean this advice: start up Eclipse `=&gt;` next `=&gt;` next `=&gt;` `HelloWorld` if that's the advice you would give to an **experienced** C++ programmer, then i really can't have a rational debate here..
You were downvoting the person you were talking to. You weren't having a rational debate to begin with.
You beat me to Calendar. Curse you. Upvote for you.
It's like looking at 3 generations of the same idea. Each generation built on the lessons of the previous. You can really give credit to java.util.Calendar's mistakes for making JodaTime so awesome.
JodaTime JodaTime JodaTime!
&gt;You were downvoting the person you were talking to yes, that's what i do when i disagree with a post, if i agree i give an upvote, another complex system explained.. here have an upvote, i did not know that you took upvotes/downvotes personal back to the question at hand: still waiting for your `expert C++ =&gt; Java` advice..
Yeah, it's easy to see that creating a time class is a messy, messy problem. One need only look at the [javadoc](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html) for it to see some examples of the crazy cases it needs to handle. So I have some sympathy for the creators of it, but that doesn't change the fact that Calendar still had some serious design issues...
Sonar is a great way to have a view of large codebase : http://nemo.sonarsource.org/ .
Downvoting people while having a conversation with the is pretty rude. Anyway, my advice was given and stands. Feel free to disagree.

Swing vs. SWT debate has been outdated for a decade; Swing won. Except in some border cases, like if you're developing plugins for Eclipse, Swing is always a better choice. SWT and native UI elements made sense when Java was young and Swing wasn't fully developed; once Swing UI elements matured, SWT is in disadvantage - it's in constant race to adapt to each new version of each OS, while Swing uses it's multiplatform widgets which were a pain to develop... but only initially.
Absolutely, and Joda learned from those issues.
Have you rebooted the computer?
That fixed the install issue, but I'm still getting errors. Uninstalled, reinstalled, rebooted, same problem. Oh well, I'll figure it out later. Cheers.
Anyone who played *Wizardry* back in the day used p-System, although they probably didn't know it at the time.
Hello IT! Have you tried turning it off and on at the wall? Have you tried uninstalling and then re installing? It is possible to use Java with out even installing it, just copying the Files from an existing installation and setting the correct path variables (insert your flavor of OS here and cmd here) :-)
JSR-310, if you can live with minor things still moving around. Wouldn't recommend using JodaTime, it is substantially saner than java.util.Date/java.util.Calendar, but has weird quirks regarding the handling of nulls.
"Page 1,2,3,4..." Sorry, I just can't get myself to read articles that are split up like that.
There's a [View All link to present it as a single page](http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/javas-forgotten-forbear/0).
How... very... similar to apache's equalsbuilder. However, this implementation of hashCode() is great.
I'm curious, why? What do you need that a Java port would provide?
And still far far way from [ScalaDoc](http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/index.html#package)
why on /r/java ?
'cause I wrote the application which found it in Java.... Dunno.. Didn't really think about it too much...
You're over-thinking it. It's a Bobby Tables reference. A joke. If your application falls victim to it, perhaps you shouldn't be writing such applications. [And you're not the first to notice it](http://www.google.com/search?q=reddit+headers+bobby+tables)
Yep, one of my co-workers just pointed this out to me... Sorry for crying wolf!!!
You just made my day. I've never ever heard of Jodatime. So so so so much better than rolling my own DateUtils class every time.
Try the Apache commons-cli library. Lets you define the arguments, and has a handy built-in method that will generate a help on usage output.
I say no to this, what he wants to do is far to simple to complicate it by using a library.
It may help you to loop through the args array and see what the values are when you pass in different command line arguments. I know some systems include the whole command as arguments, it may be including "java" and "calculator" in the args array. 
~~It is this. Arg[0] is the name of the program running "calc.jar". Your actual arguments start at [1].~~
Java is not C/C++ and args start at 0 :)
What do you mean it ignores the argument input? You have nothing in the code above processing the argument input. 
The first element in args[] will contain a string with your operator in it. The second and third elements will contain strings with your numbers in them. You need to convert these strings to an integer type. [This](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html#parseInt\(java.lang.String\)) will probably help. Then it's just a matter of have two ints and doing some math on them based on what's in the first string.
&gt; 4.create a ram disk(virtual disk) on memory, and put your jdk on the ram disk. Aren't you just forcing your operating system to cache your JDK in memory, rather than allowing your OS to decide which files on disk it should cache? This is suspect advice. Also, that website is using some nasty pop-up advertising. 
Have you *seen* how simple the cli lib is?
Oh, if only I could disable my anti-virus software (or at least add excludes). Stupid corporate "one-size-fits-all/workers-are-stupid-lets-think-for-them" mentality.
On top of learning layout managers, when using Swing you should really learn a proper way of handling UI events. The last time I used a WYSIWYG editor every event would be handled by anonymous inner classes. This leads to very unorganized code.
Oh wow, you're right. My bad.
In fairness, that's usually an IT guy that makes up these arbitrary rules.
There's a ton more JVM flags you need to really make Eclipse the fastest. Some of these flags don't work or are unstable with older versions of Java, I'm assuming you're using latest jdk (1.6.0_u26). This is a much better set of -vmargs: -server -Xms256m -Xmx1024m -XX:PermSize=256M -XX:MaxPermSize=1024M -XX:+UseStringCache -XX:+UseCompressedOops //64bit JVM only -XX:+AggressiveOpts -XX:+TieredCompilation -XX:+OptimizeStringConcat -XX:+EstimateArgEscape -XX:+DoEscapeAnalysis -XX:UseSSE=2 -XX:-DontCompileHugeMethods -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:ParallelCMSThreads=2 -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:+CMSPermGenSweepingEnabled 
I don't see that being "in fairness," since often IT != Developer in a lot of ways. However, in fairness, usually the rules *are* instituted for a good reason--a good number of people do stupid things without such rules. That said, some of the rules *are* outright stupid. I'm not capable of downloading .exe files on my network because someone thought it would be a "good idea" to ban downloading anything that ended in .exe and was not internal. For the record, I can download .msi, .zip (including .zip containing a .exe), and any .exe which has been renamed to something other than .exe. So yeah, it's a stupid rule.
My bullshit alarm is twitching, can you really provide a good rational justification for why each and every one of those options is preferable to the defaults?
Sure. &gt; -server Enables the server JVM, which has heavier optimizations. &gt; -Xms256m &gt; -Xmx1024m &gt;-XX:PermSize=256M &gt;-XX:MaxPermSize=1024M These are pretty self explanatory. I have a lot of plugins that I use so I was running out of PermGen space is why the insane amount of PermGen. &gt; -XX:+UseStringCache Uses a cache of various strings - much more aggressively interns strings. &gt; -XX:+UseCompressedOops //64bit JVM only Uses "compressed" (32bit) object references rather than fully 64bit references to decrease memory use. &gt; -XX:+AggressiveOpts Enable aggressive, experimental-but-almost-entirely-stable optimizations. Most of these optimizations eventually make it into the default JIT. &gt; -XX:+TieredCompilation Enables tiered compilation so that the server VM optimizations can eventually happen, but they don't happen immediately. The end effect is that the first "tier" of compilation is much faster, so that the server JVM boots as fast as the client JVM without sacrificing warmed-up/fully-optimized performance. &gt; -XX:+OptimizeStringConcat This just replaces "foo" + "bar" with a StringBuilder behind the scenes. &gt; -XX:+EstimateArgEscape Estimates whether arguments are used inside a method body and if not, doesn't allocate a reference (or stack space) for it. &gt; -XX:+DoEscapeAnalysis Estimates whether a locally defined variable escapes from a particular scope - if it doesn't and it's under whatever the threshold size is, it's allocated on the stack rather than in the heap. The benefits here are incredible as most garbage collection time is spent collection young/eden where short lived objects go. With this, the short lived objects never get allocated on the heap, so you can achieve a drastic reduction in garbage collection times. &gt; -XX:UseSSE=2 Enables SSE2 instructions for compiled FP math. &gt; -XX:-DontCompileHugeMethods Enables JIT compilation for methods that would otherwise be ignored because of their size. &gt; -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC Enables the CMS GC which is more or less the best for Eclipse because developer boxes usually have plenty of idle CPU. &gt; -XX:ParallelCMSThreads=2 2 GC threads rather than the default 1. My box has 8 logical CPUs, so feel free to adjust this lower if you need to. &gt; -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled &gt; -XX:+CMSPermGenSweepingEnabled These two allow the CMS collector (which we're using) to sweep and collect PermGen space - which is necessary for class unloading to work. Both of these options are required for you to unload classes with the CMS collector. 
Very good point - and the same thing could apply to almost any toolkit, I know callbacks from SWT are commonly handled in the same way.
Packages could be written in Java instead of TeX. Different output platforms would be a breeze. A million other things.
The best way to go about this is to find a project you think is *awesome* and read their roadmap. Can you write one of their features? If not, spend some time at projecteuler to beef up your skills, then go back to that project.
Among my favorite new features is [Refresh on access](http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.7-201106131736/images/lightweight-refresh.png) (from http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.7-201106131736/eclipse-news-part1.html)
Interesting. My old workspaces were very hit or miss with the polling and needed me to hit refresh. Will see if this is better!
The official Java tutorials from Sun (okay fine, Oracle) are quite good. http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/tutorialLearningPaths.html
"Head First Java" is a pretty good beginners book.
try constructing the following loop to see if this helps you any: as the first line in your 'main' method: for(int oblivious = 0; oblivious &lt; args.length; oblivious++) { System.out.println("Command line value " ++ oblivious ++ " is: " ++ args[oblivious]); }
He says in the article: On my laptop(Aspire 4745G 4G mem ), windows 7 x64, by default, it takes more than 30 seconds to start eclipse. After the vm options tuned, takes only 15 seconds. Good god. It takes about 2 seconds on mine, but really it's too fast to even count. Even where I work with about 500,000 lines of code and all kinds of libraries it only takes about 6 seconds.
My favorite is the ability to use back/forward mouse buttons!
Get a mentor, if at all possible.
That what is to code that processes the arguments? 
I don't know about the author of the article, but at least in Helios, I can open the same file in more than one editor by right clicking on its tab and selecting 'New Editor'.
Try processing! www.processing.org
I am in starting to learn this at the moment with uni. They like to overly explain and complicate it i think. While i can understand trying to get us to understand the object oriented nature of it from the get go... I think it's better to start looking at a lot of simple code. So find 2 good forums with beginners areas and immerse yourself. Then get your hours in solving problems. At least, that's how i am approaching it. Seems to be working too.
Try the hack a day android tutorials. They walk you through all the essential steps to make functional android app with a database. Made for complete newbies. Here is the first one [Android Hack a Day 101](http://hackaday.com/2010/07/12/android-development-101-%E2%80%93-a-tutorial-series/)
My prejudices are coming out. I read this guy's post and the only thing I could think of was that Mac owners should never be allowed to code.
You know you can define any keyboard shortcut you want for extract method??
For someone who already programs, Cay S. Horstman and Gary Cornell have a series called *Core Java*. The two volume (three if you count the JSF book that's by a different author) series has been refined over 8 editions, and if you read the "asides for C++ programmers", you'll probably end up knowing more about C++ than a lot of people as well. I also recommend: [oracle/sun's tutorials](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/tutorialLearningPaths.html) and Head First Java, but Head First has some exercises that are extremely brain damaging like "take these code pieces and make a program that does X". I recommend avoiding those exercises.
A good book for Learn some Java and Object Oriented Programming is: Objects First with Java: A Practical Introduction using BlueJ David J. Barnes &amp; Michael Kölling. Good OOP introduction, nice examples for programing things. Good learning curve.
Asked and answered - thanks!
Looks like the best (top voted) tip here. Is this book up to date?
What is processing? Care to explain?
It will be plenty up to date for your needs.
Drop Sysdeo , Eclipse (the JEE version) have had Tomcat integration for many years now. 
Perfect. Just bought it from Amazon. Thanks for the suggestion.
No problem. When you feel you've mastered that one, look for "Essential Java" by Josh Bloch - the title speaks the truth.
Did you actually check to see if it came with Java? I've only used it once, many years ago, but I recall it being included with JDBC and thus Java.
No worries, I was expecting someone to call me out for it. I will say that some of those flags may be unnecessary if they've been made default - I don't think any of them are, though, but it's pretty hard to stay up to date on the XX argument defaults and I've been working on this list for years :)
No. How?
I didn't try in Helios. I know you couldn't in 3.4 and I didn't keep retrying in each release.
I kind of like the one click start/stop Sysdeo gives you. Just a convenience though - I agree you don't need it.
Assuming you mean the JDBC-ODBC bridge. It comes with java. http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/guide/jdbc/getstart/bridge.doc.html http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/jdbc/bridge.html Please note that the JDBC-ODBC Bridge is not a solution for a production environment. 
also note that you need to use the Oracle (Sun) JDK/JRE and not one from another provider.
Couple of thoughts: Too much javadoc--you don't need it on getters and setters; too much HTML in the javadocs--it's very hard to read the javadoc in the code, which is where it will be most needed; package naming is reversed: you have cashier.net--what will you do if you later want to add a subpackage? It should be net.cashier. But overall a good first effort!
Is it not more likely that they're suing so no one else ever even considers doing what Google have with Android. That's what I thought this was all about. They can win, lose or settle.. and still put any one off thinking about infringing Java IP.
Go to Preferences/General/Keys. On the right hand panel select the keyboard shortcut theme you use (Default usually unless you did something to change it), and then search for the "Extract Method" action (type in the search box). Assign any keyboard shortcut you like. You will be warned if your assignment conflicts with existing one in the same context. Pretty much any action available in Eclipse in any context can be assigned a keyboard shortcut. Different contexts can have same keyboard shortcut without conflict.
try replacing: Scanner testscore = new Scanner(System.in); //get ready to read user input int n = Integer.parseInt(); with: Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in); //get ready to read user input int testscore = scanner.nextInt(), Integer.parseInt takes a String as an argument, you're not passing in anything right now. (Edit: OK looked more closely at the code)
Also, you forgot to declare grade as variable, so do that somewhere before your if/else block.
Problem 1: you didn't declare grade.
You're local variable 'grade' is not declared. you need to put 'char grade' before the if(testscore &gt;= 90). Note: i didn't compile but that jumped out at me 
Secondly, you need to get a string out of the scanner. I haven't worked with command line input in a long time in java, so your on your own there. Then you need to give parseInt an string to parse. Also, you are trying to do your test compares off of the Scanner var rather than the parsed int. If you want more help after you rework all of that, reply here so that I orangered.
import java.util.Scanner; class IfElseDemo { public static void main(String args[]) { int n = 0; System.out.print("Enter score (1-100): "); //ask user for input Scanner testscore = new Scanner(System.in); //get ready to read user input n = testscore.nextInt(); //get user input char grade; if (n &gt;= 90) { grade = 'A'; } else if (n &gt;= 80) { grade = 'B'; } else if (n &gt;= 70) { grade = 'C'; } else if (n &gt;= 60) { grade = 'D'; } else { grade = 'F'; } System.out.println("You got a " + grade); //inform user of their letter grade } } 
i made your changes but when compiling i still get this: IfElseDemo.java:42: operator &gt;= cannot be applied to java.util.Scanner,int if (testscore &gt;= 90) { ^ IfElseDemo.java:44: operator &gt;= cannot be applied to java.util.Scanner,int } else if (testscore &gt;= 80) { ^ IfElseDemo.java:46: operator &gt;= cannot be applied to java.util.Scanner,int } else if (testscore &gt;= 70) { ^ IfElseDemo.java:48: operator &gt;= cannot be applied to java.util.Scanner,int } else if (testscore &gt;= 60) { ^ 4 errors 
sorry the "^" is pointing to the "&gt;"
i actually had that in there earlier but removed it for some reason. the word "Doh!" comes to mind
cool i got it working!!! Reddit you're smarter than my coworkers
testscore is a Scanner type you need use your int variable to compare.
i got it working. thank you
Deitel?
&gt;Why won't this little script work? "Script" traditionally refers to code that is not compiled. I'd call this a "program".
point taken. I'm used to just writing stuff for a shell, so the habit of using the same terminology is carrying over. I'll make an effort to change that though.
Seriously? Do your co-workers make a living writing Java programs? If so, they need shooting. Also, write down everything that went wrong in a logbook. All the compiler errors, runtime errors and general bugs. Summarise if necessary. Then, once you find the solution, write down exactly what the problem was and what fixed it. I used to hate doing that in Uni, but it damn well helped me to learn.
i found that bufferedreader works better than scanner in some case..
well i was exagerating, only asked a couple. one was a "student intern" like myself. the other didn't really specialize in java.
hmm, good to know
I see you got your answer. Good for you. In general, when asking for technical help, in addition to sending the relevant source code, it's useful to state 2 additional pieces of information: 1. What you expect/want the code to do. 2. What it's actually doing (in particular, if you're getting an error message, you should include that too). 
i'll remember that, thanks
If the second knew about C-like languages, they should have at least spotted the missing variable declaration. Still, hyperbole's fine, especially when complimenting someone. I still recommend that you make that logbook. It will teach you (or rather, you will teach yourself) about the compiler errors and help you determine a good approach to debugging. Use it with some exercises from some resource, doesn't particularly matter which.
I thought everyone pretty much had to use a Java VM. If there's an alternative, I'd love to hear about it.
I think he's talking about Virtual Machine, like Parallels or VMWare.
Yup.
I have used both VMWare and VirtualBox for all my java (and pretty much most of other) development. It lets me setup multiple OSs also, I develop in Ubuntu/Eclipse and if need be can test it on WidowsXP/WebSphere VM (not willingly, but if I must I don't have to dedicate a machine to that mess). Also I keep VMs with various databses so I can swap them out while maintaining the same machine name so no config change to swap a DB type. Sometimes eclipse runs a bit slow inside the actual VM (on slower machines), then I share a drive on the VM and point the eclipse on a host machine into a VM; this allows me to maintain support of multiple releases using a common dev environment. Whenever the product ships I copy and 7zip the VM so I can always go back to some previous release without having to mess with my current system. I also have a separate VM for android development so that I don't have to keep all the tools and eclipse addons around when I don't need them. I would recommend getting VirtualBox (it's free), making an Ubuntu VM (it's free) and trying it out, it won't take more than an hour or so.
Which JDK do you develop with? I was thinking of moving everything I got to OpenJDK since it will be the official Java 7 JDK.
Well, there's [gcj](http://gcc.gnu.org/java/status.html), that tries to compile Java to native (machine) code, but it is apparently still far from being complete. Subsets of the Java API appear to be quite usable, though.
I don't, but my friend who I'm developing some programs with does. He runs a macbook pro and SSHs into his home server running linux and works from there. Or sometimes just runs linux in a VM on his mac. I don't know details but he has few issues doing this, and few performance issues.
http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/jlatexmath/ ?
I do all my professional Java development in Ubuntu with OpenJDK. I have VMware running Windows XP to access work e-mail and view/print some Office documents (LibreOffice doesn't always handle complex documents properly). On occasion I also do a build and run the tests in it, just to make sure everything's still working fine in Windows. I've uncovered two Windows-only bugs this way. I only use VMware because they gave me a VMware image. At home I use VirtualBox, which I think is way better. VMware mouse/keyboard integration, even with the guest drivers installed, is just terrible compared to VirtualBox's offerings. However, if you're using a VM to "easily backup" and redeploy you're probably not making effective use of source control. That's your SCM's and build system's job. 
Thank you! I had two problems. One was that the git plugin assigned option + command + m to "merge" which I undid just now. The other was that extract method wasn't bound which I did just now. The standard shortcut works again. Thank you again.
Long story short: Don't use wait and notify. Those are very low-level tools that have been more or less superseded by newer concurrency apis. Someday when you are an awesome Java developer you *might* run into a situation where you need to understand them but it's not a good place to start. If you really want to understand concurrency thoroughly check out [Java Concurrency in Practice](http://books.google.com/books?id=6LpQAAAAMAAJ). Update: To be clear, the search-term you should focus on is "Concurrency". That's the catch-all term for running code in multiple threads and managing communication between them.
[This book is a fantastic resource for threading/concurrency](http://library.nu/docs/PAUKE719RC/Java%20Concurrency%20in%20Practice). I highly recommend you read it, it will answer all your questions.
ThreadPools are a good place to look if you just want to jump right on in.
I would agree that the concurrency apis cover 90% of what you need wait and notify for, but I still think you should have a basic understanding of what they are, or else when you hit that 10% you'll be writing threads with sleep loops that check flags. Java Thread Programming by Paul Hyde is great. The example of Blocking Queues (which in practice is covered by the concurrency apis) made sense to me. The idea of when a thread requests something from an empty queue, it should wait until another thread puts something into the queue. When something is added, notifyAll gets called, so that the waiting threads know there is something available.
I use Github, but less than a year ago my SSD's control failed and I had a total loss of data, with my last backup having been 4-6months prior. So I would like, should dataloss occur again not to have to face any downtime while restoring.
My first thought, "Why hasn't he heard of Apache Commons yet?". Second, it sounds like Objects.equals is just a utility method which could have been written personally by him a long time ago without any Java 7 features, and I have to wonder why he hasn't yet, given the atrocity of his original implementation.
Is there anything else to thread pooling other than controlling the number of concurrent threads, like database connection pooling?
ThreadPool will take care of the whole wait() notify() deal for you. You can pick a range of types, fixed thread count, single thread, unlimited threads, then add a whole bunch of jobs to it. If one thread needs to wait it will be switched out for another job for a cycle or more. You can use Futures and ThreadPools to do dataflow programming. Here is a [mortality calculator](http://pastebin.com/vL74BT3k) we worked on in a class. You see the 14 tasks queued up all waiting for data. As you enter parameters, threads will progress. A lot easier than using wait() notify() manually.
good stuff.. I have also collected some articles, tutorials and other stuff [here](http://www.javagyan.com)
Thanks a gazillon times for the link. Always wanted to check it out before buying it. Everybody says it's THE book, but little St Thomas in me has to see before he believes...
The first thing I see most people get wrong when learning multi-threaded code is thinking wait() and notify() are called on Threads. In fact, they're called on objects which are visible or shared between multiple threads, like a basic form of inter-thread communication. To use the producer/consumer example, the consumer thread will call wait() on the collection object when it has emptied the collection; this thread will then stop execution until a producer thread has woken up the consumer thread by calling notify() (or more usually, notifyAll()) on the collection object. As dominosci says though, the java.until.concurrency API introduced in 1.6 made using these directly mostly redundant. BlockingQueues and the like are all you should need for most producer/consumer style code. I'd recommend getting a working example of producer/consumer going wit wait() and notify() (if just to learn what's going on 'in the background'), but with any production code the concurrency API is the way to go. The Goetz book he recommends is also excellent. 
&gt; thinking wait() and notify() are called on Threads. In fact, they're called on objects which are visible or shared between multiple threads, like a basic form of inter-thread communication I had this exact hurdle, where were you when I learnt multi-threaded programming! I also agree that most code should be using higher level things than this, but there's no harm learning the basics so you know what's going on underneath. I would also say: Writing multi-threaded code is *hard*. There are subsets of concurrency where it's easy, but there are plenty of times it is not. I would go for simplicity over speed or "cleverness". &gt; Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you’re as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it? -- Brian Kernighan This really kicked in for me when I was writing some complex multi-threaded code in Java, I made an extremely clever and complex solution and was totally unable to track down a rare bug it had. Replaced it all with a very naive, very simple method that actually ran slightly faster in the end, too.
Not having to set the exact location/size of components is exactly the point of layout managers. That said FlowLayout is the simplest one and will just put things sequentially until it runs out of space in the window and then wrap to a new line. If you want your components to be different sizes you'll either have to combine different layout managers, use something like AbsoluteLayout (which, imo, sorta defeats the purpose of layout managers) or learn to use the GridBagLayout. See the [Java Tutorial](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/visual.html) for more details.
Each Component should have a getSize(Dimension rv) . A FlowLayout arranges it's components from left to right only, if you want anything more than that you have to look at another Layout. There are a bunch of different [Layouts](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/awt/LayoutManager.html) to fit various needs. 
Which do you recommend, GridBagLayout or AbsoluteLayout?
If using a third party library is an option, look at JGoodies FormLayout and MigLayout. They are both very good.
If it's a simple program I'd just combine a bunch of the other layout managers, writing a GridBagLayout by hand is tedious to say the least. I've never touched AbsoluteLayout (or any of the related ways to put things in a fixed place, like not using a layout manager) they don't make sense unless you're going to have your window be a fixed size (which usually isn't appreciated by the user). The main thing with the layout managers is you have to know what each one's good at and then plan your layout accordingly, once you get the hang of them it becomes fairly simple to lay out a GUI by nesting panels with different layout mangers. Another option is to use Netbeans' GUI editor, it allows for Visual Studio like positioning of layouts but unless you know how to handle it it's prone to mess up your layout when you make changes, one of the suggested ways to use this tool is to build your layout and then convert it to a GridBagLayout.
Using a layout manager not only allows the GUI to be resizable but makes it more portable. Subtle font differences between platforms, or even within the same platform, can throw things out of whack if you use absolute positioning. I've seen this sort of thing happen before, &gt; First n...: \_\_\_\_\_ &gt; Last na...: \_\_\_\_\_ 
Thanks. I'll just learn how to combine the different layout managers together. 
I think you might need to halt the thread temporarily using the [Thread.sleep()](http://www.java-forums.org/threads-synchronization/528-how-use-sleep-method.html) function. Of course, that's just a quick fix for it, and your program won't do anything else while the thread is sleeping. However, if you want other functions to be happening while you use this command, you can learn to use semaphores and halt only the thread displaying text if I'm not mistaken.
No, why should you?
Each component has it's own draw method which delegates to a paint method if Im not mistaken. You should probably do it as localized as possibly. 
wait() and notify() can be used for thread safety relying on an object's condition variable to grant access to an Object. A lock so to speak. [Monitors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(synchronization\))
There are a thousand ways to skin that cat. Could you describe your architecture a little more?
Stop right now. Forget all about any flow or other layouts, go to www.miglayout.com and enjoy. One of the biggest flaws with Java GUI design is that MigLayout isn't included in the default Java library. You're welcome.
Second this. I used MigLayout on my latest swing project and I was impressed at its usability.
So using: try{ title = tag.getFrame("TIT2").toString(); }catch(Exception e){} System.out.println(title); [I'd get the frame with encoded gibberish](http://i.imgur.com/1WYxj.png) Am I meant to just manually parse byte by byte? Or is there a method to convert it or something? Any help would be much appreciated.
You don't need a semaphore... public class DelayedPrint { public static void main(String[] args) { delayedPrint("*** this should print in the middle of things! ***", 10); for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; i++) { if (i % 5000 == 0) { System.out.println(i); } } } public static void delayedPrint(final String text, final long delayMilliseconds) { Runnable runme = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { Thread.sleep(delayMilliseconds); } catch (InterruptedException e) { throw new RuntimeException("Counldn't sleep Thread!"); } System.out.println(text); } }; new Thread(runme).start(); } }
Thanks. miglayout seems to be fairly popular. I'll check it out!
Step 1. Install Eclipse. Step 2. Install WindowBuilder for Eclipse. Step 3. Draw your layout.
What you are asking is somewhat a matter of preference, although it would be strange to throw all of your listeners into one class. If they aren't doing much, I will usually just make them anonymous inner classes.
I interviewed a number of former Sun Microsystems employees and they designed UIs the same way I always have. Netbeans UI for designing the views (WindowBuilder isn't as flexible, imo) Take the code, paste it into Eclipse. Done.
I don't think you're supposed to use toString(). I think you're supposed to use getText(). http://javamusictag.sourceforge.net/api/index.html The API docs are a little vague and I've never used this before. YMMV.
JFormDesigner is also very good if you want a standalone GUI builder.
I appreciate the effort, but gettext() is not an available method for this object.
Of course not. It's getText(), not gettext(). Since I messed up the link last time, here's the real one: http://javamusictag.sourceforge.net/api/org/farng/mp3/id3/FrameBodyTIT2.html EDIT: I think I saw an example where they had to cast it to FrameBodyTIT2 first. Alternatively, you could use the actual method they provide for retrieving TIT2 (getFrame is for the ones that don't already have methods), which I can't find at the moment but is in the docs somewhere. EDIT2: Here's the casting example: http://javamusictag.sourceforge.net/QuickStart.html
Yeah I'm well aware of how casing works in Java. getText is not available for this object. The only examples I've found of this code used the toString code I am trying. toString works perfectly for non unicode tags.
OK, then cast it to FrameBodyTIT2 first, like in the example I showed you.
AllowishusDevedander has the right idea. Usually ActionListeners don't contain much code so it is easy to make them anonymous inner classes; if you find that the code block starts getting bulky, re-factor the contents to another method or class and trigger it in the Anonymous AL code block. **Edit** This is all just a matter of preference, but I find it easier to understand what a gui is doing when it is calling descriptively named methods and classes rather than executing a lot of abstract code.
Thanks for the help this far. I've been playing with System.out.println(((FrameBodyTIT2)tag.getFrame("TIT2").getBody()).getText()); and at least now it doesn't return the entire frame, but I still get: http://i.imgur.com/BxZb9.png I'm surprised there aren't more complete functioning examples around.
One of my blog post. Mockito is a mocking framework that can assist you with BDD. English isn't my first language, so be nice :)
Out of curiosity, has anyone ever encountered a WCF service that they wished to interoperate with?
MigLayout is excellent. It is (was?) one of the most wanted "inclusion requests" for the JDK.
You could just save a local copy of the index2.html file, and run it from there, as long as the path is correct (the following is from the HTML): &lt;applet code="metronomeapplet.MetronomeApplet" archive="MetronomeApplet.jar" width="300" height="200" /&gt; So for this example, as long as the JAR is in the same directory as the HTML file you're loading it from, you should be able to run it offline. And as you pointed out, if the code in the JAR itself does somehow communicate with a server, it won't work offline. But I doubt if that would be the case. As for running it *outside* of a web page? I can't help you there, sorry. You might try running it from the command line, but in addition to specifying the JAR as you've done, specify the class to load (metronomeapplet.MetronomeApplet) like the HTML file does. I don't know if that would work, or even if you need it to run out-of-browser.
I would recommend using GroupLayout .. it was included in JDK 6 and works very good. You can define custom spaces, link the size of several components, etc.
Thanks, I tried that but the applet didn't load, even though I was connected to the internet. But as long as I'm online and it can communicate with its server-side pieces (if it has any), running it from a local page should work just as well as running from the website, right? I took this to mean I was just doing something wrong.
This really was a brilliant suggestion, the book is nice to read and the cheesy images actually help me remember stuff.
web + java = [wicket](http://wicket.apache.org/)
JDK 6 since that is what the company supports.
Glad you like it!
I've tried the following options with no luck. The options on the origined post works. I must admit that I wrote the post. -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:ParallelCMSThreads=2 -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:+CMSPermGenSweepingEnabled
No, it is not encouraged using ram disk, but it do help if you want even faster. Plus, pop-up has been disabled,it is really annoying.
This will be your best bet.
What do you mean no luck?
&gt; But as long as I'm online and it can communicate with its server-side pieces (if it has any), running it from a local page should work just as well as running from the website, right? I am quite sure this would be the case, although I'm certainly not a Java expert. Maybe someone else will have a better idea of how to get this working. Sorry I couldn't be more help!
it is definitely THE book. it is even more amazing that you actually made PDF avaiable right away. you deserve hundred upvote
logback is the successor to log4j, which is what I would recommend. http://logback.qos.ch/ The equivalent commons logging interface is SLF4J, which is required by logback: http://www.slf4j.org/
&gt; If so, how do you go about it? same as with a physical machine. Honestly I don't see the point of it. Just use a version control on a server that you can access anywhere. Setting up a dev environment from scratch only take a few minutes anyway. VM's can be useful when developing native apps because you can have a VM for every target platform. For java, it's pretty pointless.
Suggestion: Use just one JList and clear the contents of the JList's model and repopulate it with the appropriate names when an item is selected in the JComboBox. Make sure you create the JList with a model; something like: JList myList = new JList(new DefaultListModel()); Then do: myList.getModel().clear(); myList.getModel().add("name1") ... that sort of thing. I wrote this off the top of my head, sorry if the syntax is wrong. Any questions, write back here and I'll try to help.
The applet may be programmed to access other resources and files that are located on the same server the applet lives on. If this is the case then it won't work because you don't have those resources. You could try decompiling the classes in the applet jar using a tool like JODE and see if you can figure out what the applet is doing. Hope this helps.
i'll have a look at logback on tuesday, sounds interesting but I can't see it being that different. Logging is so basic at the end of the day. :)
Thanks for the suggestion! I was not aware of listDataListeners and using models. I'll try it out.
Still having a little trouble with this. I created a DefaultListModel, but when I click an item from the JComboBox instead of displaying the names it displays a long string of information. Here is what I got cabinList.addActionListener( new ActionListener() { public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { JComboBox cabinList = (JComboBox)e.getSource(); String cabinSelected = (String)cabinList.getSelectedItem(); listModel.addElement((populateCabinList(cabinSelected))); list.setSelectionMode(ListSelectionModel.SINGLE_SELECTION); list.setLayoutOrientation(JList.VERTICAL); pane.add(list); frame.pack(); frame.validate(); } }); populateCabinList returns a JList. I originally used JList list = populateCabinList(cabinSelected); and that displayed the names, so I don't know why this isn't working. Thanks again for your help.
I've moved over to using OpenJDK 6 on a large commercial application for that exact reason. With ORCL's move to OpenJDK it is just a practical thing to do.
aka "varargs" which is handy to know if you need to google it as "..." does not make a good search term.
It's a useful tool but should be used sparingly in Java. Java is meant to be a typesafe language and tries to do as much compile-time checking as possible. When you start using varargs on things like interfaces or even worse "Object" that you cast into something else, you are losing a lot of Java's type safety. Varargs should only be used as a last resort when you cannot make a method fit within standard method limits.
Just because `printf` is an evil monstrosity doesn't mean every use of varargs is that bad.
It *is* an array. The only difference is that the caller of the method doesn't have to use the array construction syntax. Kyrra is warning about poor uses of varargs (e.g. a proliferation of `Object...` parameters everywhere), not the semantics of varargs itself.
I had to find out about this vararg after I noticed Amazon was using them. At first i thought eclipse was just being screwy and did the "line too long so im going to put ellipses everywhere thing" but then I found out about this. They use them in the sense of "String... attributes" for when you want a query to simpledb to return specific sets of attributes or a single attribute. Turned out to be very convenient.
It's worth noting that calling a varargs method will create an array object. This makes it unsuitable if you are trying to reduce memory allocation and therefore GC load. 
Here's the list of the 17 vulnerabilities fixed by this release, sorted by CVSS Score: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpujune2011-313339.html#AppendixJAVA
Been using it since Indigo beta. Re-installed it at release time. * No problems installing anything * Eclipse marketplace is great * No problems getting my usual plugins. Very straight forward. * Improved debug view (conditional breakpoints view brought out onto the tab) * Great integration with M2E * Great integration with GIT
"Free" to me for such an item means accessible or downloadable. For Sun I might have filled in my personal info, but Oracle I won't trust with my info, especially for something so trivial. Pretty clearly a lot of spam coming out of this (see the "keep me informed" section of the signup). Upvoted regardless so others can form their own opinions. Also: **Oracle Publishing allows sharing of our postal mailing list with selected third parties. If you prefer your mailing address not to be included in this program, please check this box.** 
Get lost Oracle. 
Reading the comments, I'm not the only one hating the Oracle registrations form.
I'm guessing that the "long string of information" you're seeing is the default String representation of the object in the list. For example, if the object you added to the list is a User object, it might look something like "User@abc123def456" or something like that which is basically Java's internal name for that object in memory. If the User object implements a toString() method, such as ... public String toString() { return this.getUserName(); } ... then the JList will use that method to determine the display text and the username will appear the list instead of the internal Java name. I'm not sure what type of object your populateCabinList(...) method is returning but, if I'm on the right track, adding a toString() that returns your desired display text might do the trick. #UPDATE: Or you can avoid a lot of headaches by just putting a string in the list's model instead of an object. I don't mean to throw too much info at you, but just a a couple additional notes for future reference: toString() is not actually "supposed" to be used to return UI display text like that. It's "supposed" to be to return a human readable representation of the object for debugging purposes. For example, a "real" toString for my fictitious User object should look something like: public String toString() { return "[User; username="+this.getUsername()+"; phoneNumber="+getPhoneNumber()+ "]"; } The "correct" way to customize the display text that appears in your JList would be to implement a ListCellRenderer that is capable of building the display for your specific object. But a lot of the time people just use toString (even though that's actually a kludge). For more info on ListRenderer see this tutorial: http://www.java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0240__Swing/InstallListcellrenderer.htm 
If you registered with sun, it seems reasonable to assume that Oracle already has your info?
I only waste my time filling out these magazine subscription forms if it is dead tree. Electronics Products is great. So is Security.
I spent about 2 weeks trying to get ivy to do what I need. You can set up rules in ivy-settings to tell it to use a specific repository for a particular package and avoid re-configuring your existing repository. (Nothing tells you to try this.) I eventually decided it wasn't worth it, and I think that a smaller system that was more clearly documented and did only about 20% of what ivy does would probably meet my needs better. 
Got it all worked out now. Thanks for the info!
The Maven part is true. It really takes care of dependencies. The support in Eclipse is sometimes a little buggy. You need to disable and enable dependency management for some project from time to time. 
In Eclipse: select your project, right-click, Export... , Java &gt; Runnable JAR-File and you're done. You're welcome ;)
I think your difficulties arise because you have external jars. When making jars for projects that have external jars, I always use OneJar and build with ANT. This [article](http://obscuredclarity.blogspot.com/2011/05/java-one-jar-example-using-ant-and.html) I created a while back should help you get started.
jar -cvfm Program.jar manifest.mf HelloWorld.class or something like it from cmd.exe
I think herrtim is right about external jars, and if you don't want to try OneJar you'll need to do a little research on putting jars on the classpath when compiling/executing. Adding some detail in your post like a list of the files and relative locations as well as the command you're using may help get a more specific response. In addition to this though I wanted to point out a distinction in terminology. Class files are compiled, jar files are not. The jar file is just packaging of compiled class files, a jar is nothing more than a zip file. This concept can be very important when working on complex projects. With a tool like OneJar for instance you're going to create a single jar file with class files originating from different JVM complilers, and maybe even different versions of compilers. If you're just starting out this is a good concept to drive home early, and since many seasoned developers will refer to "compiling jars" as shorthand for the real process, it can be confusing.
Not really cutting edge news. If you work with java and haven't heard of maven you must have been under a rock for at least 5 years.
I have had nothing but problems with Maven. I gave up on it entirely.
wouldn't you just add them to the class-path in the manifest file? http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/downman.html or would you add them to the input files? http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/build.html
Eclipse does create .jar files - both ordinary and executable. It's a point-and-click deal, which is far easier unless you are running automated builds on your versioning server.
When I try this, it shows a couple of my other projects in Launch Configuration dropdown, but now the one I actually want. How can I fix this?
Well that's hard to say. Usually the dropdown menu should list all Classes that contain a main method and are therefore runnable.
So, last week, my boss and I were going round and round about this awful PHP codebase I inherited. I've been trying to get him to let me move it to Java. His attitude is: "I already paid for this code once, I should have to pay for it twice". Fair enough, were I in his shoes, and with his set of experiences, I might have made a similar call. So, I took an afternoon, and rewrote a Twilio driver library that we were using inhouse. I then did a little micro-benchmarking on it, showing 1000 requests, round-tripped. Initial PHP code took 4401 seconds, just about 4.4 secs per request. My Java code took 247 seconds, just about 0.25 secs per request. 17.8 times faster. His response: "Gheeze that's compelling.... how long will it take to migrate the whole codebase?"
JavaFX is horribly slow. Compared to LWJGL is lags behind by an order of magnitude as far as performance is concerned. There s no way JavaFX could render 10,000+ Sprites at 60 Frames per second. Were LWJGL doesn't even break a sweet.
That would explain it. I don't have a main method. When I try to add one it creates issues with static vs non-static methods. If I make everything static it conflicts with methods I import.
Hmmmmm .. Basically this sounds like should deal with this problem first before trying to put anything into a jar. The easiest solution would be to post the code you are working on, so that we can take a look it. You definitely need a static main method because this is the entry point for any application. Did you run your app at all before trying to put it in a jar??
Now do it in C.
I ended up just creating a new class with the static main method that creates an instance of my first class and then calls the methods I had had in my run method of the first class. A pretty simple fix but it worked. thanks for you help.
While I understand your argument, and could likely pull it off, I doubt my C skill can outdo Hotspot's optimizations. On top of that, fuck a bunch of any ORM not named Hibernate.
Close enough I guess ;) Happy Coding!
http://maven.apache.org/
Re-implementing everything without any reason but "it's faster!!1!" isn't smart either. If your customers / users want better performance, go ahead, if not, it's a waste of resources IMHO. Other than that: I'm a Java guy, so wohoo! 
Well, given a choice between maintaining 20k lines of spaghetti PHP on an obsolete framework (Kohana 2.x) or doing it all in Java (which could give us: * Hibernate * a better migration path for load-balancing * a far superior user-session management system (Spring Security) * better debugging and profiling tools * oh, and 17.8 times performance improvement
Probably depends on how many plugins it has to load. 2 Seconds to load eclipse is crazy, are you on sd hd or something?
I have had Indigo running on Java 7 for about a week now. Better subversion and maven support. 
The problem with GC advice is that it quickly gets out of date, generally in favor of less thinking about GC (better escape analysis, etc.). Then the old techniques just make things worse and lots of code needs to be updated. In the very early GCs, consing was bad, but now consing is good. Edit: Looking more carefully at the post, I think the wrapper example isn't entirely honest. No need to use Integer in a for loop just because there's a Map&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; nearby. If the wrapped integers are cut down to the minimum, I'm GCing at about half the rate as before. Also, the GC for that 100MB of Integers is a whopping 100-150 ns on my machine. 
Wait... isn't that explained by the pre-allocation of memory by the HashMap? Ah... and maybe the automatic casting stuff required to do that +1.
This runs with no noticeable loss of performance on my machine and zero garbage collection. import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import org.apache.commons.lang.mutable.MutableInt; public class LoopBenchmark { public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException { int runs = 20 * 1000000000; Map&lt;MutableInt, MutableInt&gt; counters2 = new HashMap&lt;MutableInt, MutableInt&gt;(144); for (int i = 0; i &lt; runs; i++) { int x = i % 12; int y = i / 12 % 12; MutableInt times = new MutableInt(x * y); MutableInt count = counters2.get(times); if (count == null) counters2.put(times, new MutableInt(1)); else count.add(1); } } } 
This is an autoboxing anti-pattern. The profiling illustrates why it is an anti-pattern. Because the primitive wrapper example is needlessly creating new objects constantly, I don't think it is a good comparison for performance. Below is what I would view as a more correct use of primitive wrappers. It would be interesting to see how this compares to the other 2 profiles: Map&lt;Integer, AtomicInteger&gt; counters = new HashMap&lt;Integer, AtomicInteger&gt;(); int runs = 20 * 1000; for (int i = 0; i &lt; runs; i++) { int x = i % 12; int y = i / 12 % 12; Integer times = x * y; AtomicInteger count = counters.get(times); if (count == null) counters.put(times, new AtomicInteger()); else count.incrementAndGet(); }
I assumed AtomicInteger's locking would kill the 40 ns time, but no. This GCs just about as much as the non-wrapper version, and it's just as fast. 
I think this is what you are asking, assuming your 2d array variable 'array': int max = 0; int column = -1; for (int i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++) { int currentTotal = 0; for (int j = 0; j &lt; array[i].length; j++) { currentTotal += array[i][j]; } if (currentTotal &gt; max) { max = currentTotal; column = i; } }
Comparing Integer[] to ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; would have been fair. Comparing a O(1) to O(n log n) is not really correct.
Depends if the links in the html file are absolute or relative.
yep. core 7 2600k with a ssd, 8 gigs of ram.
There is no locking in AtomicInteger. The Java Concurrent Atomic objects use non-blocking CAS algorithms. Take a look at the source code: [AtomicInteger.java](http://www.docjar.com/html/api/java/util/concurrent/atomic/AtomicInteger.java.html)
Nice and quick JPA example, thanks!
How about I slap your shit
That looks cool, but you know what I would love to see? Haskell running a JVM. Is it feasible? I have no idea, but Python, Ruby, and a zillion other languages are doing it now, so it seems that it couldn't be totally impossible...
yes, this should work..
I solved the problem as such, sorry for the undeclared variables, etc. Java had my head spinning yesterday, as its syntax is somewhat confusing. But I got it to work: //KP MAX CONCURRENT VALUES // Matrix that is nFrames for columns, and displayTrackNr for Rows int[][] kpMatrix = new int[nFrames][displayTrackNr]; //Populates the kpMatrix with 1s from firstFrames[n] to lastFrames[n] one row at a time for(int n = 0; n &lt; displayTrackNr; n++ ) { for(int i = firstFrames[n]; i &lt; lastFrames[n]; i++) { kpMatrix[i][n] = 1; } } //Searches through kpMatrix one column at a time to find the maximum value, stores it in kpMax and kpFrm int kpSum; for(int i = 0; i &lt; nFrames; i++) { kpSum = 0; for(int n = 0; n &lt; displayTrackNr; n++) { kpSum += kpMatrix[i][n]; if (n == displayTrackNr-1) { if (kpSum &gt; kpMax) { kpMax = kpSum; kpFrm = i+1; } } } } // For debugging. Outputs raw 1 and 0s to console // for(int i = 0; i &lt; displayTrackNr; i++) { // row = ""; // for(int n = 0; n &lt; nFrames; n++) { // row = row + kpMatrix[n][i]; // if (n == nFrames-1) { // System.out.println(row); // } // } } // EOKP
I've seen a few tutorials but none have been awesome. I'd like to see a real working useful program get made with plenty of explanation along the way.
I have been doing [Eclipse and Java for Total Beginners](http://eclipsetutorial.sourceforge.net/index.html) and think they are absolutely fantastic. [Here is a link to the actual files I am using.](http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipsetutorial/files/1.%20Total%20Beginners/Version%201.0/) I also have VB and c experience as well as a lot of javascript, so don't be fooled by the total beginners title.
I am a recent convert from PHP to Java (about two years ago) and the best thing I can tell you is go online and buy a copy of the Head First: Java and Head First :Servlets &amp; JSP books. Took me about half a day each to read through but I felt like I could hit the ground running.
[Java tutorial](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)
Thanks!
I will search in my University library first or ask them to buy for me this book :D Of course I need fundamentals first but I am thinking of developing mobile apps (J2ME, Android) and keep PHP as language for website development... As I understand, J2ME is considered already old but for Android programming it still has use
As far as I know, J2ME and Android API are very different, even though in both cases you program in Java. Android is reportedly much nicer than J2ME.

The Sun/Oracle tutorials are really good. [Start here](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html)
Thinking in Java, Bruce Eckel /thread
J2ME is dead, ignore it. Unless you are considering releasing applications targeted towards developing (third world) markets
Just got started with Maven and it is nice for dependency management.
Ime after you know a few languages rather well, not necessarily great, but well enough that you know what to expect out of a language I have found it best to just start on something. If you want to work on a project and need to use java then look over whatever you're working with and in the process of learning the lib, api or whatever you'll naturally just learn it. You *should* be able to pick up some java and read it with a little reference material as it is.
I like codingbat's Java exercises, but I don't think you can learn Java solely from those.
Not sure if trying to be sarcastic Or just pasted the wrong link.
What I would use is a blocking call, something similar to: http://www.velocityreviews.com/forums/t143123-blocking-calls-in-java.html On each jpanel, create an if statement to make sure the blocking flag isnt true. From there you could queue up the next click or completely ignore them. If you run into issues, post the code and I can try to troubleshoot.
I second this, used these tutorials to really get a grasp of the language. 
What do you know about the [Event Dispatch Thread](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/dispatch.html)? The listener will be called by the EDT - you'll have to set a flag, execute your actual listener code in a separate thread (so the EDT can return immediately) and then lower the flag once your actual listener code has completed.
I'll definitely look into that... for now I've got a fairly crude solution as suggested in the comments [here](http://www.thatsjava.com/java-essentials/31772/)
It would be easier if you posted a link to a pastebin of your code. ^_^
My attention goes to Scala, which I adore for its multiparadigm flexibility. Its elegant blend of functional and object-oriented programming is a marvel to work with.
since term is a double, the result of term/12 is also a double; you could either cast the result into a int or if term never contains decimal values you could make it an int to begin with. *edit* Also wanted to add that double is not very accurate and often produces rounding errors. This looks like homework, so it is probably fine, but for production code it is a good idea to use BigDecimal for calculations instead.

Rules for writing programs that deal with money 1. Do not use floating point (float, double) for money. 2. Do NOT use floating point (float, double) for money. 
Also, 3. DO NOT use floating point (float, double) for money.
the 2nd one &gt;.&lt; Sorry didn't check..
What else to use? edit: [Found this.](http://www.javaranch.com/journal/2003/07/MoneyInJava.html)
I suggest looking at Scala. Judging from the authors comments &gt; This project attempts to hack around Java's lack of higher order type polymorphism ("higher kinded types"). &gt; Of course, new features in Java 7 and 8 could help to scrap some of the boilerplate, most notably lambdas (a.k.a. closures), extension methods (a.k.a. defender methods) and the diamond operator. &gt; The project grew out of my frustration that I couldn't define even a simple general Functor interface in Java. Scala is exactly what he wants. It provides higher kinded types, closures, implicit conversions (a more flexible "extension algorithm" and type inference.
&gt; Why floating point is bad when working with money FTFY
I don't know if it's like that in all the other languages. 
I will be for most languages supporting floating point arithmetic as most will adhere to the [IEEE 754 standard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-2008) which defines floating point arithmetic (or the old version of this standard from 1985).
It is, pretty much. And if you think about it, it more or less comes down to: floats/doubles have a finite size. They're often 64/80/128 bits. There are an infinite number of real numbers. Even between 0.0 and 1.0 there are infinite real numbers. You cannot represent an infinite amount of numbers with a finite set of bits, there have to be compromises/rounding. This is a must read: http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html
I think it's cooler that it comes with WindowBuilder.
Java 7 is a step in the right direction, the Fork/Join additions will be great. TheRegister hates Java, and really hates Oracle, so I'm not surprised they turned their nose up at the release.
If you are on linux you could use [taskset](http://linux.die.net/man/1/taskset). If you have control over the code and it's using an executor service you could limit this to a single threaded executor service. I'm sure there are also other ways to cook this but that is two ideas.
the 5 years for a new release thing is pretty shitty. But I am excited about some of the coming features. The features I really wanted when I started reading about Java 7 (2 years ago) were all pushed out to Java 8, so that part makes me a little sad.
Yeah I'm really hoping that we don't end up waiting another 5 years for Java 8 &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; I already will have to wait five years for gov't IT systems to clear Java 7, we just got the thumbs up to start using Java 6
ok people...JUST THINK OF HOW THE PERL6 PEOPLE FELT. 5 years is nothin' :P)
haha, The Great Wait was the reason I went to PHP/Java. Interviewer: Why did you stop coding Perl? akinder: I'm just not a patient man
Wait, doesn't this basically happen automatically since there is only one GUI thread?
What it was doing was queuing up the events... So if I had my event handler sleep for 10 seconds, and clicked 5 times in those 10 seconds, the event handler would run 5 times; it would wait for itself to finish, and then start over, like a buffer. I wanted the event handler to only run once, and ignore the other 4 events.
I see your point but to be fair the minor releases of 6 have included lots of JVM improvements. So although the syntax has not evolved during 6 it's not like the entire language has stood still.
I didnt realize that double can be inaccurate for math. Looks like bigdecimal is much better!
Hey, you could use something similar to the following to get your word count. This might have to be adapted depending on your end result, but it's a start. String str = "one two three"; String tokens[] = str.split(" "); int count = 0; for(String s : tokens){ count++; } System.out.println("There are " + count + " words."); 
I got it to count correctly. Now I need to make the same word counted as the same word instead of as different instances.
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? :D sout(tokens.length);
Sir I'd advise you to read a little bit of String API, because that monstrosity you've produced is as far from Java as assembler is...
my code?
Well, the code in the original submission. So I assumed you wrote it.
Thanks for pointing out that bit of redundancy in such a constructive manner. :)
it should be java. it's for a Java class.
Holy crap, we just got [Phasers](http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/jsr166/dist/jsr166ydocs/jsr166y/Phaser.html)
On the front end, I would say look into Swing possibly? As for the spreadsheets, I would think that converting the sheets to some format and then parsing it with regexs or simple string manipulation would work. Store it, reference it like they did in the spreadsheet. Have a method for each calculator, make it simple?
Why not just export the excel data into a google docs spreadsheet, and embed that on your page?
We're still waiting on PHP 6 too ;)
From the looks of the PHP community, it might be a while :/ Last time I was on the phpc/php internals mailing list it was nothing but infighting and arguments over the stupidest shit.
Java to XCode? afaik XCode is an IDE and Java is a programming language. Why do you need to convert your Java projects to XCode? There's Eclipse for Mac.
This, and also many languages have support for arbitrary precision using something like BigDecimal in Java--these are how one should work with precise values, that currency requires.
Thanks - I'll definitely look into Swing. I've seen it referenced, but haven't dealt with it. I'll take the opportunity to learn about it. 
That is a great idea - I think I will try this first before the Java implementation and see if I can meet all of the requirements this way. 
There might be some good points in here, but &gt; A fatal quandary with the F/J Framework is that it is trying to manage Tasks. Only the Operating System (O/S) or a pseudo O/S can manage Tasks (whether they’re called tasks or processes is all the same thing.) What? No, a task, in the context of F/J, is just a sequence of actions to be carried out in some thread within the program -- it's nothing like an entire process. Am I missing something?
That's why Java has BigDecimal. If you use the wrong feature for the work you're trying to do, any language can be made to look silly. 
Has there been any announcements regarding the release date of JDK 7 for Mac?
why make something needlessly complex? 
I winced
Which libraries do you guys use to do this? I had to something similar the other day, and I don't have much experience in Web Services. I ended up using Jersey, as it provides an easy to use Client. 
Here's another solution that's a little more robust with the use of another Scanner, a Map, and a StringBuilder. The Scanner will split along all whitespace instead of just spaces. Also, the Map allows for individual counts as well as a unique count at the cost of more memory. Hope it helps somehow. import java.util.*; public class WordCount { private static final int LINES = 6; public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner console = new Scanner(System.in); StringBuilder para = new StringBuilder(); System.out.println("Please input " + LINES + " lines of text. "); for (int i = 0; i &lt; LINES; ++i) { para.append(console.nextLine()); para.append('\n'); } Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; counts = new HashMap&lt;String, Integer&gt;(); Scanner words = new Scanner(para.toString()); while (words.hasNext()) { String word = words.next(); if (counts.containsKey(word)) { counts.put(word, counts.get(word)+1); } else { counts.put(word, 1); } } System.out.println(); for (String word : counts.keySet()) System.out.println(word + " : " + counts.get(word)); // Each word and its count System.out.println(counts.size()); // The number of unique words } } 
If the Gdocs thing doesnt work and you still need to hand craft it, try to build a simple screen using basic HTML and java script. Swing has a pretty big learning curve. To get all the data out of the spread sheet, just open it in Open Office ans save it as a ODS file. Then unzip it. It will give you all the sheets in neat XML docs which you can read and get the cell dependencies and formulas out of.

OK, you need to get some facts straight. First of all, if you're dealing with .dex-files my guess is you're doing Android development. Thus I would also recommend using Eclipse for Mac. If you're not satisfied with this at all and there's no way around Xcode for you than take a look at the ADC pages at Apple. There's a support document on Java development with Xcode burrowed somewhere. But be aware that there is no official support for Java anymore so this might be dated back to Java 1.2 release or something. Good luck and Happy Coding!
Awesome responses. I figure I should clarify my issue as of now: Currently, I've got a working one page android application that does a nifty timer operation with a certain protocol. I'm looking to cross platform from my HTC Incredible to my iPhone 4. I figure that since build 1-6 has simplified my design a whole great deal, there should be less work involved in doing that. My specific question: what are the differences between the two phone languages that need to be taken into account? So far, I know android uses .dex in substitution for the .class for mac programs. That's about it. I'll wear the dunce cap if it means I can learn a bit more. Thanks for the feedback. Each post is one more entry I can reference in my studies.
I started with these, they're great!
Holy fuck, this is crappy, buggy, insecure code, and a prime example of why you should use a webservice library. I noticed the following bad practices: * Concatenating (presumably user) input directly into xml string without using an xml parser. * Calling xmlInput.getBytes() which uses platform (read "random") encoding. Never ever call String.getBytes() or new String(bytes), without specifying an encoding. Those methods should be deprecated. * He takes those bytes which are in a byte array, write them to a ByteArrayOutputStream, and then calls bout.toByteArray(), to get those *same* bytes in another byte array, instead of just using the first byte array in the first place. * Specifying utf-8 as charset in header when he just chose an encoding at random. * Uses new InputStreamReader(InputStream), which again, uses platform (random) encoding. Never ever call new InputStreamReader() or new OutputStreamWriter() without specifying an encoding. * Using BufferedReader.readLine() which corrupts data (throws away line endings) * Concatenates a string from an input stream instead of just providing the InputStream to the XML Parser. This is low quality "seems to work for me" programming, which shows the author has trouble grasping the difference between bytes in an inputstream, bytes in a byte array, bytes in a ByteArrayOutputStream, characters in a string, and data in xml, and how to convert between them. Also, why it's worth to use well tested libraries. **Tl;dr**: "How to **not** call a call *[sic]* a webservice directly from Java" 
I'm not sure whether this is possible at all. Because afaik there are no Java bindings for core iOS features thus "cross-development" would be a real pain in the ass.
What I've decided to do is just grin and bear a new build for iPhone using the same .png files for the GUI, and an approximation in logic. I suppose my next project will be built on FB 4.5 with this in consideration before I code. Thanks anyways all who replied. Knowledge is power.
If I can't do what I want with Google Docs I'll give this a shot - thanks for the warning on Swing. I've dealt much more with HTML (and much more recently) than Java. 
What library would you recommend, then ?
We use JAX-WS at work, but i've used Axis, and it works pretty well too. I suspect there might be something better than both of these though.
That worked like a champ!!!
Maven seems to be missing from that list.
Nothing formal that I have seen, anecdotally I seem to recall reading a blog entry or interview with someone in the know who was glibly saying a few months after the other platforms are released at the minimum. But I don't recall where I saw that, I will see if I can dig it up in a few minutes.
So wrong... Just use cxf
from the article : "...horror that is Java API soup..." I actually like this 'horror'. Browsing all the docs, youre bound to find something cool, or useful, every single time. Its huge, yes, and you cant memorize it all, but do you really need to? Other than that point, good article.
Sorry, but that's a pretty terrible list. No sense of a target audience either.
Is it printing anything out? Maybe tell us a little bit about what you have tried and what happened.
I was using a char instead of a String but that would only print out the letter A for the grade, I'm pretty sure I should be using a char instead of a String, but i dont know how to print out the char because it could be an A, B, C etc. edit: now it wont print out anything
look at your switch cases, 10, 8,7,6 are too low for normal grade levels; by changing the switch to: switch (((int)average )/10) I was able to get it working. I also had to name the class and import java.util.Scanner.
Mind commenting on what you disagree with and why?
thank you!!! so very much this stupid switch thing was driving me nuts for the past day, thank you again!!
Next time paste your code to pastebin.ca or something so we can read it more easily. Also, as others suggested, tell us what you've done and haven't done so far.
Can't say I disagree, it's just not a terribly compelling set of reasons. By example, I might argue that you should buy a car because: 1. Cars take you places. 2. You'll end up using them anyway. 3. Everyone else does. 
Alright will do thanks 
Yup, Java is fine. The JVM is even better. I love the libraries I can find and it's everywhere. I'm also very interested in Scala and Clojure as well as Groovy. All good.
They only docs I've found to be "horror" is the Python docs. I can never find what I'm looking for without Googling the heck out of it.
I never stopped.
People who wrote Java off in the pre-Java 2 days would be surprised at how nice it is now.
Dunno about Python, but Ruby's APIs are garbage. Everything has a cutesy one-syllable name, like "slurp" or "swalp" and the description is always "slurps the code--see swalp". And of course, with no typing information, good luck snooping (surprised that's not one) the class structure.
GitHub Gists are much better suited for this kind of an activity.
It's really hard to make sense of all this. My first question would be: do you even get to the part where it is supposed to write to text to the file? Because as far as I can tell your while-loop only terminates if you click cancel, until then, the Save-Dialog keeps popping up. And of course if you click cancel, then there is no file to write to, because it is set to null. Really odd behaviour. So why use a while-loop at all. Just store the result of showDialog into your int variable and use an if-else-clause to control ok/cancel-behaviour.
second argument in your post (last argument in the actual list), did sound a bit strange.. you can't escape Java - why fight it! IDE's make it less horrible is also a great argument from the compilation.. i love Java, but that list was not very convincing..
Maybe, but that requires an actual account, doesn't it?
No, you can also do it anonymously, but then you lose some functionality.
http://sourceforge.net/projects/sheetster/ http://www.smartxls.com/indexj.htm
&gt;as far as I can tell your while-loop only terminates if you click cancel, until then, the Save-Dialog keeps popping up Bingo. There was a point when this was not the case, and then when I came back and pulled out all the "System.out.println(*Debugging message*);" lines I accidentally erased the line that set returnVal to JFileChooser.CANCEL_OPTION and broke the loop. I am *positive* at one time it was there. Just staring at the same code for too long. the reason I used the while loop was in case of write failure to a an otherwise valid output file (outFile), perhaps due to a network issue that would happen mid operation; the while loop lands the user back at the save dialog with the message about write failure where they can choose another out put file (or the same one if problem was temporary). I suppose I could just have it pop up the failure message and land back at the main application window and the user could chose the text output option again as needed and it would avoid the possibility of getting stuck in this loop. *Edit* - at least that was my intent, looking at the code it wouldn't actually work that way at all. I am certainly not an expert in UI design. The switch case can definitely go, it was left over from when that dialog had three buttons (where it could also have easily been replace by if if else else). My coding approach is to keep throwing stuff at the IDE until the application does what I want, then I go back and optimize. Lots of optimizing to do on this project still. My plan is to GPL it and hopefully get some help with that. Thanks for pointing me at the problem, apparently I needed someone to look at the code and tell me it was broken before I could see where.
Yeah lots of optimization to do. It looks like outFile could be put inside the while loop along with the last if statement that write ouput; as tiiv pointed out the while loop might ought to be an if statement although to some extent that is a UI design issue. filename is never used at all. thanks for your help.

Read "Thinking in Java" from Bruce Eckel
i would start with a basic java intro course, there are tons online. Check out the "Trials covering the basics" section [here](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/). after you get a feel for the basics, then try to use that to write some program. doesnt have to be any thing fancy, the point of it is to fight your way through it an learn a few things. Then its just rinse and repeat. Each time pick a little harder project. For your first projects i would suggest a text based calculator, text based tic-tac-toe, or some other text based game. After you've had some experience with some simple apps, and have become familiar with a build system like ant or maven, then move up to some simple game like tetris with some simple lib like java2d. at that point you will really need to learn about data structures. I would guess that it will take someone that works a few hours a week 6ish months to get to this point. good luck.
Check out [http://codingbat.com/](http://codingbat.com/). It'll help teach you the basics.

This is perfect. Thanks so much. These videos are funny too!
Yeah, even the later ones (which have pretty tough concepts) are really well done and funny. This guy is what programming professors should be. Good luck on your studies! And once you're done with learning Java (it sounds like you want to do Android programming), I recommend getting these online books from http://wares.commonsware.com/
I would start with Processing (www.Processing.org) so you can get started with 2D and 3D graphics right away. Get the Learning Processing book by Daniel Shiffman.

As a starter and test, pick something small that you can complete quickly and move onto something else.
umm... no headless mode?
Stackoverflow is a better bet for this sort of question. There's not really enough information here to debug it... did you accidentally use a static variable in finished()?
Huh... that's funny. I spent most of my day sweating my butt off in an office without air conditioning (because it's Sunday) collecting requirements which is apparently TOP PRIORITY (it must be, because it's Sunday!). Depend on air conditioning!!!
To have a chance to answer this it would be very helpful if you post at least the code of your Alpha class. Better would be if you include the AlphaControl class as well.
REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING IN DA HOOOOUSE!
It's not "my" Alpha class, Alpha is an API object, part of the Java3D framework. For what it's worth, here is my AlphaControl class: public class AlphaControl extends Thread { public Alpha alpha; public GraphicalWalker gw; public AlphaControl(GraphicalWalker gw, Alpha alpha) { this.gw = gw; this.alpha = alpha; } public void run() { boolean stop = false; boolean finished; while(!stop) { finished = alpha.finished(); if( !finished &amp;&amp; !gw.pause ) { gw.pause = true; //System.out.println("Pause!"); } if( finished &amp;&amp; gw.pause ) { gw.pause = false; //System.out.println("Unpause!"); } if(finished) { stop = true; //System.out.println("Time to die!"); } } } }
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Java_keywords
This is seems like a dubious way to learn Java, but here's my shot at it: [a list of java keywords, ie words that are built into the language itself to do things](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Java_keywords) There are only 50 of these, and they're pretty similar to C/C++. (Some of these words don't even do anything....) [A list of everything available in the java standard library](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1,5.0/docs/api/) This contains all of the various objects and services available to you in the Java standard library. There are thousands of objects here, many of which you'll never use/need.... I think it would be pretty hard to teach yourself java just from these lists, maybe you can use some of the resources on the [Java Learning Trail](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html) from oracle.
What other programming languages do you know? You might be able to find tutorial sites catered to people fluent in others. 
That was painful to watch. They should get some presentation skills. 
I think you're looking at learning to program the wrong way. The hard part that takes time to learn is not the "words" you use to create the program, but more abstract concepts like the overall design and the process of realizing an idea or process as a series/set of discrete objects and procedures. Learning the keywords or language syntax is trivial compared to the years and years it takes to develop the intuition it takes to program well. "Learning to program" is the hard part that IMO comes after the easy part it is "to learn to code". Take the time to learn java (or any programming language) in the order it is presented in the literature. Somebody obviously took the time to write it in a certain order for a reason.
could not get the code to run. I tried running it in eclipse and it contains errors. thanks though
There almost certainly is one but make config didn't show it and a quick Google didn't turn anything up
How does this look? Straight or tilted? Don't worry, we won't point the camera at it. Instead, watch me spill water on my laptop.
You're going about it the wrong way. Learning the syntax is the easy part. Try starting at http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/index.html Expect to require at least a year or two to learn it fluently, and at least ten years to learn to use it effectively.
Shortly after the back button was used.
If you don't have any other programming experience, try starting with [Objects First With Java](http://www.bluej.org/objects-first/). It is used for many introductory Java courses. You can pick up an older edition for really cheap.
How does struts2, tomcat and spring relate to each other?
I can't find any errors with it by just compiling it from the command-line. What does Eclipse say?

thanks an immense amount this is outstanding
I hope you've figured this out by now, but: //Split the input string on 'space' (NB. this will fail to produces the correct result for a typo like "this,won't work") String str = "one two three"; String tokens[] = str.split(" "); //Now tokens hold all words separately - we only want one instance of the same word. Sets only allow one instance of the same object. HashSet&lt;String&gt; wordSet = new HashSet&lt;String&gt;(); //Now we could just add the array to the set (using Arrays.asList(tokens)) but that would make the counter case sensitive, e.g. "Word" != "word" thus counted twice. //Make all words lower case and add to Set for(String s : tokens) { wordSet.add(s.toLowerCase()); } Sytem.out.println("Number of words: "+wordSet.size()); Edit: formatting

6667 is the destination port. When you create a connection, it doesn't use that same port locally but a randomish unprivileged port.. Short answer: Yes. The end you are trying to accomplish is possible, you just aren't quite understanding how the connections generally work. Example: Browse some web pages. Open up a terminal and run 'netstat -al' and notice how the ports next to the local address are all not port 80 (or 443 for TLS), but the destination ports however are port 80 (or 443). Edit #85: Check this: $ netstat -al Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address Foreign Address (state) tcp4 0 0 192.168.75.123.50656 s3.amazonaws.c.http ESTABLISHED tcp4 0 0 192.168.75.123.50655 s3.amazonaws.c.http ESTABLISHED tcp4 0 0 192.168.75.123.50654 12.22.186.32.http ESTABLISHED tcp4 0 0 192.168.75.123.50653 12.22.186.32.http ESTABLISHED tcp4 0 0 192.168.75.123.50652 12.22.186.32.http ESTABLISHED tcp4 0 0 192.168.75.123.50651 12.42.186.32.http ESTABLISHED tcp4 0 0 192.168.75.123.50650 74.125.25.72.http ESTABLISHED Format for the Addresses is `ad.dr.e.ss.port`.

If you put an image in the bin folder directly it should be easy to access it by simply using the file name. Note that if you use packages it needs to be there anyway. Not in any subfolder. Besides that you should explain how you load images to give any further advice.
For crying out loud. I'm pretty much working full time in C# now, and sometimes it's not until I see posts like this that I realise how good I have it over here.
Ditto - it's been a while since I had to deal with Java, and this post reminded me why that is such a good thing.
What's wrong with the way Java does it, and how does C# do it?
You can explain why in one sentence? Enums are really just integers, and integers are primitives.
That's not true in Java. In Java, enum instances are full-blown objects that can have methods. That said, there will be only instance of each enum element, so it is fine to use == or != instead of the equals method when comparing Enums.
That's maybe right in C. Enums in Java are full-blown classes. `==` (identity comparison) can be used because the specification says that it is not possible to "instantiate" a different instance of an enum object.
Yeah, someone already mentioned that.
Is it necessary to come to /r/java and complain about Java? Don't even say that you were browsing /all, it's a lame excuse.
 def countWords(input: String) = input.split("\\s+").distinct.length Done.
I was hoping for a response about C# simplifying object equality in some useful way. Any language with composite types, all the way back to Lisp (eq, eqv, equal, =), has to worry about separating the several different meanings of equality, since each one is important. It's weakly typed languages where it actually becomes a problem. That's when the === operator is needed: "No, I *really* mean equality this time." 
I wasn't - I am subbed to /r/java because I have some experience with Java and I just want to keep up to date. I'd simply forgotten how backwards it was and was remarking on the fact - wasn't complaining. 
I don't always have errors in my programs... But when I do, I prefer them at compile-time.
&gt; "In reading the Daubert briefing, it appears possible that early on Google recognized that it would infringe patents protecting at least part of Java, entered into negotiations with Sun [Microsystems] to obtain a license for use in Android, then abandoned the negotiations as too expensive, and pushed home with Android without any license at all," Ouch...
I feel like a complete idiot. I swore I did that before. But, coming from a tech support background where everyone is like "I already tried that! Don't waste my time", I decided to try again out of good faith. This time it worked. Thank you!
It is a shame Android is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. If it were GPL v2 or v3 any judgement or settlement would render the offending patents pretty close to public domain (EG, unenforceable and should someone be sued over it just be able to point out you have a license through xyz).
My guess is that the file location is incorrect. Try adding the src directory as well. 
I agree in principle that code should be visible and readable, but the idea of diagramming your code seems to be a bad idea. First, if you actually need to actually draw a diagram, it suggests that your code design is over-complicated and should be re-designed. Second, for any team other than the most disciplined process-oriented teams, this is an open invitation to have outdated documents. As soon as the next developer makes any small significant enhancement, the diagram will be out of date, and worse than having no documentation, it will be misleading.
Great points. Out of date documentation was exactly my first thought when it comes to having diagrams. But I always wonder what would happen if - through some magical tool - the diagrams were updated automatically? As for having code that needs to be re-designed. Yeah, perhaps that is true. But, how often do we have the time to actually do the re-design? Hopefully documenting the complexities will be much faster.
C# is a nice language, but again the reason why I didn't jump to C# is it's not cross platform. Don't give me the Mono crap. I can use all of Java's libraries in all platforms. Even on Apple's JDK. IIRC, not all of Microsoft's libraries are in Mono. If you want nice language, try Ruby or Python and they're both available for the JVM.
There is already a lot of research in deriving these sorts of diagrams from existing code, e.g. a graph of dependencies between OSGi bundles in Eclipse. Highly recommended. I try to make most of my documentation derivable from the source code. That way, my documentation "never" goes out of date.
OMG! Thank you, thank you, thank you. 
Funny stuff eh? Make a slightly negative comment about Java in /r/java, especially one which references C# and see what happens!
I wouldn't have this problem in /r/dotnet, and I think that speaks volumes.
No problem!
Yeah, there is some research about getting diagrams from code (and I have been involved in it). But research is useless if it does not help software developers - and there are very few people today who use diagrams from code. Also, any links to such research and ways that you get documentation from code? It will be great to share good ideas.
Was anyone else expecting an article about choosing the correct access level (i.e. public, protected, default) for your classes and fields? I think that this is something that makes it much easier to grok a well-though-out api, rather than a bunch of diagrams.
Not sure I understand what you are saying, but no license Google put on Android has any impact whatsoever on Oracle patents. If Sun had licensed the code GPL then the patents might be affected, but if Google is found to violate Oracle patents, the Android license used makes no difference to those patents.
uh... no???
If you have a bit of a programming background, then I can't recommend Agile Java by Jeff Langr highly enough. If gives you a thorough basis in Java and it teaches using test driven design.
I vote cancer.
I don't want to endorse it, but the E.F. Codd is no slouch. He pretty much invented relational databases. BCNF? That C is for Codd -- this Codd. That said, this model is a PITA with hibernate. You really need to make sure that your app doesn't rely on the children/ancestor calls being fast. Oracle has optimizations around this model, so previous dbas/devs may have written it expecting the same optimizations. Codd was also a huge, HUGE proponent of data models that didn't have null values. They represent poor data modeling. The root nodes of trees with a parent column will always be null. Whether or not you want to argue with Codd is up to you :)
Fantastic response, by the way. Scholarly as all hell. &gt; You really need to make sure that your app doesn't rely on the children/ancestor calls being fast. At present, I will absolutely confess that the SELECT FROM TABLE WHERE LFT &lt; X and RGT &gt; Y syntax is clever, and very fast. But, the, median depth is around 2 for any tree, and the maximum depth is 9 (which is absolutely manageable). Having said that, total PITA with hibernate. &gt; Oracle has optimizations around this model, so previous dbas/devs may have written it expecting the same optimizations. Sure, but I'm running MySQL. Also fair to say that here, the DB isn't the biggest bottleneck. (Actually, it's this massive spaghetti PHP codebase). &gt; The root nodes of trees with a parent column will always be null. That doesn't make me cry. &gt; Whether or not you want to argue with Codd is up to you :) I live 4 miles down the road from [Peter Chen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Chen). If I wanted to argue with the gods of RDBMSs, I could just knock on his door and start a fight :)
Yeah - for most API's correct access levels are much more important. But when you have a large application then architectural diagrams are very helpful. Issues with the Architecture can make or break the project.
Thanks. And -- ugh, PHP :) I stopped doing that 4 years ago and moved to java, and damn it's a lot better, even when you take Hibernate into account. But, the LFT and RGT bits stuck out to me. Can you describe the data model a bit more if those aren't the parent/child descriptors on the adjacency list? Whenever I've seen the LFT and RGT, it's usually a [nested set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_set_model) style tree. In fact, without the Oracle optimizations, I'd be surprised if you could get all descendents in a single query. Usually going N levels deep with a true adjacency list requires N self-joins. I tried to write a some hibernate a while ago to manage nested sets, but never did finish it. The thing I _really_ like about the nested sets model is that you can get the entire tree from your node to the root in one query -- and in order. So with 1 query, you could theoretically get an entire breadcrumb trail :)

I believe up to this point, I've been using the wrong terminology. Rather, I believe that the DB is actually using nested sets (courtesy of the LFT and RGT), and that I misread the 'adjacency list' description and mentally affixed that to the 'alternate' (read: nested sets) solution provided in the article. And now, this statement: &gt; In fact, without the Oracle optimizations, I'd be surprised if you could get all descendents in a single query. Usually going N levels deep with a true adjacency list requires N self-joins. Makes perfect sense to me. &gt; The thing I really like about the nested sets model is that you can get the entire tree from your node to the root in one query -- and in order. So with 1 query, you could theoretically get an entire breadcrumb trail :) Sure. Agreed. 
where is 'on' declared, and where is it changed? If you want the thread to run forever then it's fine to do a while(true) or similar inside the thread. If you want to turn 'on' or 'pause' to false to halt execution make sure you declare them as volatile class members. Also outside your 'pause' loop, you should probably include a Thread.sleep() so you don't use as much cpu in your pause cycle.
Your question is rather confusing. What do you mean by "dangerous" ? What is "on" ? Why do you set "pause" to true before setting it to false ?
i believe [blocking queue](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/BlockingQueue.html) is very good solution to your problem. for example: private BlockingQueue&lt;Work&gt; todo = new ArrayBlockingQueue&lt;Work&gt;(); public void run() { while (true) { Work work = todo.take(); // do something with work } } public void do(Work w) { todo.put(w); } 
they are meant to work with the following : //fields public static volatile boolean on, pause = false; public void pause(){ pause = true; } public void unpause(){ pause = false; } public void stop() { on =false; } use case : let's say i have a List&lt;String&gt; containing urls as a class member, and in each iteration of run I download content from each of those urls, and now I want to add another url to the list, is it enough to declare the list as 'volatile' and do without the pause-stop-resume song and dance ? //i'm thinking yes, but the stop-resume thing looks so neat !!! // also, it has to be a Runnable,because the thread class has a pause and stop method which it doesn't want you to use ... 
Yes that would work, however you probably want to use a FIFO queue instead of a list, see her01n's comment about blocking queue. You don't need to volatile the queue unless you are setting it to a new reference (i.e. your thread class has a setQueue(Queue q) method. Otherwise the reference value isn't changing, so there's no need for volatile (test this yourself though). You would probably want to synchronize the reads and writes on the queue though. You could still include your stop and pause methods if you want, stop would be particularly useful for a graceful shutdown.
neat !!
The answers here are good, but they don't make the case for why you need to change. The reason your loop unsafe is because of a race condition between while(!pause) and the content of the loop. It's possible for the changeField to be called while the thread is attempting to dequeue. You also want to avoid spin-loops, because they tend to eat all the CPU, burn excess energy and slow down the rest of the system. When waiting for another thread to do something, you should always try to block instead of polling. And if you MUST poll, do so slowly.
My eyes are fooling me then...
Can you elaborate on these "operations"?
JCAPTCHA is, so far as I can tell, no longer maintained. You might want to try out [SimpleCaptcha](http://simplecaptcha.sourceforge.net).
Better question: WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU USING ECLIPSE?
It is what my company uses. What do you recommend?

Did you take a look at your font color settings? http://help.eclipse.org/indigo/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Fconcepts%2Faccessibility%2Ffontsandcolors.htm 
Interesting... since [bespin][1], I've been intrigued by online code editors. Alas, I still haven't found anything that comes close to vim :/ Unless someone knows about an online vim? With a user-based vimfiles folder. Just plain vanilla vim is boring ;) [1]: http://bespin.mozilla.com
I just think it's neat because it incorporates an online compiler so you can literally compile it over the web and download the jar/class(es)/war, etc. I haven't found anything emulating vim over the web with the exception of ssh'ing to a remote box haha... 
I've never used a 'web app' that was comparable in user experience to a normal desktop application.
As a redditr, I think this looks like a very good webapp for a programmr.
Yeah, the only thing I did was change the font and size. Wouldn't the color theme override that?
I like the concept, I can see this really taking off in the coming years. I know I'm not the only one who would love to be able to code on a netbook. With svn and git my code is already online. And I use Maven so I'm already downloading my dependencies from central repositories. It'll be a while before we'll see a rich web-based ide comparable to netbeans. But we will have the ability to easily code from anywhere.
BlockingQueues are great, but they don't solve everything. For example, if you are blocking to get your work, you cannot stop your loop until something comes through. Even though on is set to false, it won't get back to the top of the loop until it receives and processes the work. You'll want to have a reasonable timeout when fetching from the queue, this is the maximum time you would need to wait before interacting with that thread again. It depends on the level of control you need for it to be a few millisecond or a few seconds. public void run(){ while (on) { Work work = todo.poll(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); if(work == null){ continue; } // do something with work } } With this, you know the loop will end within 100ms of you setting on=false. The queue does the blocking for you, and you only spend a few cycles every second to check your loop flag.
Does it really have to be web-based though? Couldn't it just be a rich desktop client app, just the editing/syntax-highlight and maybe method signatures and such is done locally. When you hit save it would upload a file, or a diff of the file to a server. Compiling would still be server side, and storage would be there. Would/Could that be light enough to run on a netbook?
Well the syntax highlighting, type checking, and auto-complete are pretty intensive for large project. The ide almost has to compile the project to get the information, and there is a lot to load into memory. Right now we can only get all of that in a heavy desktop application. There needs to be an fast way of getting your changes to the server in real-time and then update your ui with the results. This is significantly harder than something like a web-based spellcheck in google docs, with that your changes only have local effects. Misspelling a word only affects that word. Changing a single word in code can cause every line in your project to break syntax. Once you get that, you can implement the actual UI for a browser or desktop. A web-based version has the added benefit that you always have the same environment from any machine without setup. Just log in and go. 
Note: if the images don't move into your output/class directory when build/compile, it still won't work.
Or use Scala, where you can write methods whose return type is `this.type`.
I like *Java Concurrency in Practice*'s solution to this, static final Work POISON = new Work(); public void run() { while (true) { Work work = todo.take(); if (work == POISON) { break; } // do something with work } } private void stop() { todo.add(POISON); } 
Yeah, that would be a better approach. It doesn't work out in my rare exception. Recently I've been working with Apache Qpid, so my blocking queues are connected to a remote broker. If the connection drops and I lose the queue, I need to be able to control things. 
What is this, StackOverflow?

Hi, java uses OpenGL via JOGL. You can find an updated tutorial here: http://sites.google.com/site/justinscsstuff/jogl-tutorial-1
Try [Lightweight Java Game Library](http://lwjgl.org/) Java doesn't have OpenGL bindings by default. We are using lwjgl for scientific programs, as well as I used it personally for games development, so don't let the "game" part throw you off, it really just referrers to the fact that it has input and sound libraries as well. It is very similar to JOGL, but I've found lwjgl to be nicer to work with.
There are multiple ways for Java to bind to or wrap OpenGL. The import lines that are failing will tell you which library you are using. Either search on the failing lines or post them here.
OpenGL isn't a library that you download separately, its something that is suppose to come with your graphics driver.
Anyone can program. Not everyone can program well. Books vs College: Depends on your learning style. C++ is jumping in the deep end. Object Oriented Programming is a concept that is hard enough. C++ is just convoluted. If you're interested in developing for Android and you want to see your art in game. Learn Unity. It's C# (Or Javascript if you prefer) and it's approachable. The tutorials are great. There are a bunch of books on it and it's initially free for PC development. Invest 400$ can you can release for Android. 
I suspect you might've lost something in trying to copy/paste/simplify, because both Test2 classes make no sense - you say 'this.test = test' in both, where this.test is String and the arg test is of type Test1. Unless Test1 extends the final class java.lang.String or you have your own String class which isn't defined here, neither example should work at all. Other than that, I don't see what should cause this. Clean it up a bit, and maybe the problem will become evident (or it might be gone, thanks to other cleanup).
yeah thanks for pointing that out. I fixed it now. I'm wondering if this is a Jigloo problem because I've never encountered it before.
It might be Jigloo. Have never worked with it, but your first example executes just fine without an NPE in a very simple test class (just the example plus wrapping main class). So it must be something coming from the surrounding code for the Swing logistics. This might be some instrumentation/background boilerplate code coming from Jigloo and doing multithreading in the background. Passing on *this* from inside the constructor is not thread-safe and generally a bad idea (see [here](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp0618/index.html) under 'Don't publish the "this" reference during construction'), but in a single-thread scenario, *this.textfield* should not be null. What is actually null in your case? "this"? "this.textfield"? Or does the NPE come from inside *JTextField.setText(String)*?
Not true. Enums are probably better described as static final instances of the same class. They can have properties and methods just like other classes/objects.
One of the Java 7 proposals (ultimately shot down) was for void methods to automatically return "this" for this very purpose. This would be very nice because then you could get what you're talking about here for free (most likely with appropriate type casting as well), and not even have to say "return self()" in your code.
test is null in each. In the first example you refer to the textfield field of test - this causes the NPE because test is null. In the second you do not refer to any field of test so no NPE.
I've done a lot of research on it, but nothing published yet :-) YDoc is one example though.
In the first case, test is the first param, which was provided as new Test2(this) - are you suggesting that where 'this' is legal it can ever be a null reference?
~~the textfield itself is null. so "this.textfield". I have a JComboBox and a couple of other textfields in class 1 as well, which are all NPE'ing on me.~~ No actually its the "this" that is null. Thank you for the link you provided...i think i kinda understand the problem, however i have no idea how to avoid it. Actually i do publish the this-reference during construction. The JTextField has an abstract action which invokes a new instance of class Test2, which receives the this-reference of class Test1. And all that happens during the initialize() method which is called from the constructor in class Test1. However, I'm lost as to how to do it without passing it on during construction.
Well first off, JTextField does not have a addItem(String) method ([Java SE 6 API](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/JTextField.html)), I belive you are referring to setText(String) ? I created the following test suite based on your examples but I can not get it to portray any NPEs. http://pastie.org/2230470
thank you. yes its of course setText what i mean. Anyway, i managed to fix it, it works now. I can't really explain it though because the example i provided turns out to be rather useless. Basically I had to declare a test1 static variable, and when i pass it onto the Test2 constructor it won't be null. Anyway, no one should bother with this anymore. Thank you very much for your effort.
Glad you got it working :)
A "Judge" decides there is a violation without a trial. I am afraid this is going to be a fiasco. 
Couple of thoughts: * For readability, try to keep your variables all lower case - it looks like Ans and Ans2 are classes with static functions if you don't read very carefully * Early in findUlams you have a doubly nested for loop, building up a list of sums of all pairs of numbers in SUlams, which you then proceed to sort. Why does this need two loops like that, where half of your numbers are going to be duplicates (A+B and B+A)? * In the second for loop in findUlams, you test if i&lt;Ans.size()-1, but the for loop should already make that happen correctly, right? * The last for loop goes over each item in Ans2, after you just built that up - why not test each value there, instead of making another loop? * Last for loop again, you might have a bug - you are removing elements from Ans2 after looking at them - that will mean that if I have [10,9,8] and i == 0, so I test 10, and I call .remove(0), the list is now [9,8]. Then I increment i to 1, and read 8, skipping 9... * Answer = Ans.get(0) - if this works, why build up the rest of the Ans2 list? About half of those points will affect your performance, the rest just make your code make more sense so it can be read more easily, or make your intentions more clear. Consider a logging statement (like System.out.println()) at periodic times in your code, outputting something to indicate progress – I think you'll see that as num gets bigger, the whole process takes longer. If this is for an algorithms class, or if you have taken an algorithms class already, then try to figure out what the complexity of the various parts of this should be, and see if you can confirm that with your logging statements.
... and if you inspire to do more programming in the future (not only java), then get in the habit of using a proper logging package right from the start. In the case of java, that could be: * [log4j][1] * [apache commons logging][2] * [Java2SE Logging][3] The earlier to get to grips with this, the better. Much better than ``System.out.println()`` I recommend it even for quick'n'dirty whip-ups of short algorithms so you can get used to it. And it's actually more comfortable to write as well. To set up (for ``java.util.logging``): public class MyClass { private static final Logger LOG = Logger.getLogger(MyClass.class.getCanonicalName()); ... } and then anywhere you want to write some output, you do: LOG.info("my message") Mind you: "``info``" is not the only method. But to get started this solves the job. [1]: http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/ [2]: http://commons.apache.org/logging/ [3]: http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/logging/overview.html
Rather than any of the three above, I suggest you use the more modern [SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org/), coupled with [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch/). Anyway *exhuma* is right, getting in the habit of using a proper logging package is very important.
I didn't do a thorough code-read but my first suggestion is that you might want to employ Memoization: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization I agree with some of the previous comments on readability. It's actually the main reason I haven't looked at your code in detail. This looks like a fun problem though. Out of curiousity, how long did it take you to come up with a solution? 
* Thank you, I will try to keep them in lowercase in the future . * my idea in the doubly nested for loop is if the number is appeared two times "a+b"&amp; "b+a" then it will mean it is the sum of two distinct integer( that's why I put all the sum in one array and sorted it ) * I testes if i&lt;Ans.size()-1 because I was going to compare the Ans.get(i) with the Ans.get(i+1) "if I didn't put that check I will get OutOfSize error" * because I need to test it after getting all the value &amp; sort it (as I mentioned earlier, my idea was to get all the sum of every numbers, if the sum is duplicated only twice "a+b &amp; b+a" then it will be the distinct sum of two number, then I will have an arraylist of all the number that have duplicated only twice , I will remove all the earlier presented number in the Ulam array, then I will have my answer ) * in this loop,in this list there's no duplication and I am only trying to remove each item in the list which is presented in the array of ulam so if I have a list of (3,4,6,7) and the ulam array have[2,3,4], is will check the 3 if it is presented in the array it will be removed, then than loop will finish, then it will start again wish the 4 do the same as it did with the 3, it will remove it .. then I will have in the List(6,7) and the final answer will be the 6 . I will look into the logging statements, but now as I am studying the tutor only required me to use System.out.println Sorry for my English but I am not that good in English . I will try to edit the code .. thank you all for your help ^_^
Thank you for the URL, I will loop into that (but as I am new in JAVA "only know the basic" I will try to understand memoization) about the readability, I am sorry for that, but I was trying to speed up the process of writing the code (I am taking extra class to participate in the programming challenge between colleges and university) it is fun :) ... it took me 1 hour to write my idea in a working code "although it worked for few amount on numbers "
double. not float or int. 
if I recall correctly, there are issues with it not being as cross platform compatible as it should be, as well as adding size to your app. Also, anything it can do, you can do with flow layout. You may also want to look at JLabel setBounds(x,y,w,h); 
lol this issue was discussed just today, Im glad its not as nutty as I thought it might be lol.
It's of course kind of hard to comprehend what you are trying to achieve with your code. However I think it's generally bad practice to link two constructors together like that. It just makes them very prone to errors, in case you change something just in one of them. Since you are obviously dealing with GUI development I encourage you to make yourself familiar with the MVC-Pattern as it makes lots of things so much easier.
Is there a text version somewhere?
It's quite situational, but 95% of the times I agree with him. I like to think that for loops describe a "contract": the initialisation, and the stopping condition. If you introduce breaks, you basically violate this contract, which leads to multiple exiting conditions and makes the program flow harder to follow. 
He is wrong. Multiple return points are a good thing. Returning once done makes the code more concise. Show him Martin Fowler's discussion of break, continue and multiple returns in the refactoring "Remove Control Flag" in his book Refactoring Improving The Design Of Existing Code.
wow, two differing opinions that I find myself nodding in agreement to ... (haven't read the fowler piece)
As others have said, most of the time he's right.
Lets just say this, if your loop block is bigger than what you would like, then I'd say he's right. Multiple breaks would make the thing a very hard beast to follow. If the block is small enough, then I don't see why anybody would care. I generally apply the same logic with return as in when is using return aside from the end of a method acceptable. As far as contract goes, I disagree with this "philosophical" stand point of view. It's a bit too dogmatic to my taste. For instance, you can just redefine your contract as such: A for (foreach, whatever) loop's contract is simply to test whether to loop or not when it reaches the end of the block, not to loop on all values fed to it. I mean ideally the loop itself shouldn't know anything about the size or nature of what's being fed to it aside from the thing being iterable. 
&gt; there are issues with it not being as cross platform compatible as it should be There are several features that are platform dependent. MigLayout can automatically reorder the Ok/Cancel buttons depending on the platform standards (GNOME, MacOS X, Windows, have different requirements there). MigLayout can also be made to use the platform standard button width. Some people think this is a great way to be closer to the platform native look-and-feel without writing a single line of platform-specific code, other people think there should be no difference between platforms whatsoever. All such MigLayout behaviors are optional and can be disabled. But maybe your were thinking of some other cross-platform issue? &gt; as well as adding size to your app 80 kB last I checked. Which is wonderfully tiny considering all the features that are packed in that Jar. And not that much overall. &gt; anything it can do, you can do with flow layout I don't remember enough of flow layout to provide contradictory examples. Anyway, MigLayout is such a productivity boost that it doesn't matter if another layout can achieve the same result, if it takes much more developer time and energy. This is especially true when it comes to maintenance and evolutions.
Memoization is a concept, it has nothing to do with Java, so don't worry.
I am afraid you both are right but since he is CTO, he is always right. :) From programming perspective, it depends on collection of objects that you are running in foreach loop. If you have large pool of objects and you want to perform an operation on only few of them, you can use continue/break when you are done. Using break/continue makes a flow little hard but sometimes you have to use it to make code more practical. Long looping through 1000 large object vs selective looping through 100 objects among 1000 objects gives you better performance.
Here's [c2's wiki page](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SingleFunctionExitPoint) on the subject. I mainly agree with it. I think it's a hangover from the Structured Programming movement that was necessary for it's time, but has long been eclipsed by changes in how programs are structured. Personally, I hate seeing what could be three line function swollen to 10+ lines with the introduction of variables to hold return values and control flags.
If you are looking specifically for pair of numbers, why not use a Set&lt;Integer&gt; for the results, and another set for banned numbers, and when you get ready to add each number, check if either set contains that number. If so, remove it from results, and make sure it is in the banned set. This reduces the steps in your for() {for(){}} by about half right there, and eliminates the need to loop through the results again. Maybe instead of a Set, use a sorted List - always insert into the list at the position where that number belongs, probably using Collections.binarySearch. Then, if the outer variable (i) is greater than the first value in the list, you can give up and return the first value, eliminating lots of extra work. As the gap between ulam numbers beyond 1000 appear to be small, this will likely reduce your complexity in a very very big way. sahala's suggestion of memoization can help too - instead of starting from scratch each time, use the known ulam numbers to initialize your banned list.
hey, many thanks for the advice. I'll check it out. My program that I'm working on has only 3 classes so far, I'm not even close to being satisfied with it AND it's confusing me already to a point where I'm about to lose motivation. so thanks again. edit: which GUI-builder would you recommend to use with Java in eclipse/netbeans? What I'm using now is Jigloo and I like it because I can basically click together the GUI and all that's left to do basically is program actions. But I'm curious to know what other people prefer and why.
you are a genius ... just gave me an idea .. Collections class have removeAll function (remove the duplicated items) will try that and see how much time do I reduce Thank you 
Post back! Inquiring minds want to know!
If you go through the appeal from authority route, you can as well cite this: http://www.scribd.com/doc/38873257/Knuth-1974-Structured-Programming-With-Go-to-Statements 
The one big advantage about j.u.Logging is that the jvm already has it - for a class project, the student is unlikely to be setting up much of an envirnment at all, and some constraint may be placed on what libraries can be used. The purpose of using Java to teach (what appears to be) an algorithms problem like this is to use a language itself, not to teach the vast and wide ecosystem. Just my two cents, as one who currently uses slf4j / logback, but isn't a student anymore.
Single Function exit != Avoid mixing break/continue and termination conditions in for loops
I will post back as soon I get my hands on my laptop ~ 2 hours later .
Have you ever added code to a loop that had a hidden break statement in there bugging it up?
It's not about not introducing bugs, it's about understanding the code faster. As many programmers, I spend more than half of the time reading shitty code (without executing it, just reading). So I appreciate when the for-loop does what it says it does. Unless of course if it's a very obvious and short loop (like iterating on a list searching for a value, and break on finding it).
If you're using Java in you're day job, then it's not a difficult exam. Many of the questions I got where gotcha questions where they left out a semicolon or had an invalid variable name. I took the certification for performance review reasons (it was a suggest goal of my manager.) I don't think it's a big deal, it didn't teach me anything that I use in my day job. I have sat in on interviews where the interviewer looked down on having the certification.
Thank you for the reply. I figured that it wouldn't be that useful.
If you don't have experience, I would suggest working through the Associate program first. The Programmer cert implies a pretty thorough working of Java and tests on the finer details.
He is right in the sense that it's goto-like functionality, but you are right when you claim that that's _good_. That's why break and continue were introduced, to provide goto-like functionality in the cases where goto would be a good thing!
Thank you for the reply. Can you tell me more about the Associate program? 
nice now if only i could convince work we should stop using 1.4 and 1.5...
Fair enough, I asked because personally I don't find it harder to read. Breaking when the work is finished seems pretty logical to me..
I wish I could; I did things the hard way and skipped it. [Here](http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=319) is the link to the Associate page.
Thanks again!
I will disagree, considering this looks like a homework assignment. I doubt the professor would want to have to deal with everybody's third party libraries.
The certification will not help you get a job. In fact, I know a lot of hiring managers in technology who avoid certifications, because they've found certified programmers to be among the worst. In short, proving that you know the syntax of Java inside-and-out doesn't mean you can write a good program, understand good OO design, or anything like that. That said, I personally found the process of studying for and taking the SCJP (what it was called when it was still Sun) to be a great experience. I learned a lot more about Java as a result, even though I had been using Java for years. It made me more comfortable with Java itself, and I found it fun to study for the exam and rewarding to take it. It's worth doing, but do it FOR YOURSELF, don't do it for employers. Sometimes I don't even list my certifications on my resume (I have 3).
So for becoming a better Java programmer what do you suggest I focus on besides becoming more comfortable with the syntax and OO principles and Design. Thank you for answering
I think you'd be better served by purchasing [Head First Design Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/First-Design-Patterns-Elisabeth-Freeman/dp/0596007124/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1311102573&amp;sr=8-1). That book will do wonders. Previous experience with employers were that if you put down that you were java certified on your CV then you'd be unlikely to get an interview.
Read the following: * A book on Design Patterns (Head First Design Patterns is good) * Read "Effective Java" once you have a decent handle on Java's syntax. It's a book that teaches good idiomatic Java. * Read "Clean Code", it helps you write better overall code * Read "The Pragmatic Programmer", it helps you develop as a professional * Read "The Clean Coder", it helps you learn about how to conduct yourself professionally * Read "Refactoring", it's about how to detect problems in code and how to fix them This is not ordered, attack these books in whatever order looks interesting to you. 
I already have the Head first one so I'm on a good start. Thanks!
Have the book. I guess I better read it lol. Thanks!
good counter points. I change my stance to : play with both.
No worries. I had access to it at my previous job but was too busy to read it. Bought it at my new job and made time to read it and I'm glad I did. Hopefully others will see this and add other books that are useful too.
So why did google vote no?
Google approved the release on technical merit but objected to the licensing terms. src. [infoworld.com](http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/java-se-7-gets-thumbs-standards-committee-614)
Ill add one. Write some code. Think up a library you may find interesting and design and write it. It may be horrible or it may be fine. Stick it on sourceforge(or whatever) and see if anyone finds it useful. Learning to write good code is about underrstanding why the code you just wrote is crap.
A+B and B+A are equivalent and won't effect the outcome of the calculation. One idea I have is that you could probably do all of the work with a single integer array. An integer array containing 1000 ints could just contain the number of sums calculated from previous Ulam numbers. You have already done this a little in the beginning with the 1 and 2. But instead of setting the array value to the Ulam number you can understand the Ulam number from the index. Then use the value to describe the number of sums created from previous Ulam numbers. For example: ulamNumber[1] = 1; ulamNumber[2] = 1; ulamNumber[3] = 1; ulamNumber[4] = 1; ulamNumber[5] = 2; ulamNumber[6] = 1; Here is an example of my idea: import java.util.HashSet; import java.util.Set; public class UlamNumbers { // use a set, since you know each element will be unique // The hashset makes it so you can find an Ulam number faster O(1) - contant time assuming no collisions // private Set&lt;Integer&gt; ulamNumbers = new HashSet&lt;Integer&gt;(); public UlamNumbers(int max){ //create an array where the index represents the "potential" ulam number //the value of the array will contain how many combinations of ulam numbers can add up to itself // 0 means that no Ulam numbers can add up to this number // 1 means it is an Ulam number, assuming you have evaluated all the Ulam numbers less than it // 2 or more means that it is not an Ulam number // see the example above for the first 6 potential Ulam numbers int[] sumCount = new int[max+1]; sumCount[1]++; //we know by definition at 1 is an Ulam number, so set the value to 1 indicating it is an Ulam number sumCount[2]++; // 2 is also an Ulam number, so set the value to 1 indicating it is an Ulam number //evaluate each number from 2 to the max (e.g. 1000 in your example) for ( int i = 2; i&lt;=max; i++ ) { // ignore this number if it is not an Ulam number // since we have evaluated all the numbers less than i, we can be confident that it is an Ulam number or not if ( sumCount[i] != 1 ) continue; // When evaluating i finding sums of Ulam numbers that will be larger than i // for example i = 2 and sc = 1 are two Ulam numbers // this means that sumCount[1+2]++ so potential ulam number 3 will end up with the value 1 // in this case we will not evaluate anything larger than 1 for sc, because we know 2 + 2 does not count towards Ulam determination // for example i = 3 and sc = 1 then sumCount[4] = 1 // i = 3 and sc = 2 sumCound[5] = 1 // i = 4 and sc =1 sumCount[5] = 2 &lt;- so we will skip i=5 in the future because we know it isn't Ulam already // i = 4, sc = 2 sumCount[6] = 1 // i = 4, sc = 3 sumCount[7] = 1 // i = 5 skip, because we know it is not ulam // i = 6, sc = 1 [7] = 2 &lt;- not ulam // 6,2 [8]=1 // 6,3 [9]=1 // 6,4 [10]=1 // 8,1 [9]=2 // print out this info with debug or system out if you want to see everything for ( int sc = 1; sc &lt; i; sc ++ ) { //don't consider non Ulam numbers, since it is less than "i", we can be confident we know it is Ulam or not if ( sumCount[sc] != 1 ) continue; //continue means it will go to the next value if i from the beginning of the for loop int index = sc + i; // index is the another potential Ulam number // ignore potential Ulam numbers greater than the max value of the array, otherwise we will get an array out of bounds exception if ( index &gt;= sumCount.length ) break; // mark the potential ulam number by incrementing it once. sumCount[index]++; } } //add all the counts with value 1 to the ulam set for ( int i = 1; i&lt;sumCount.length; i++ ) { if ( sumCount[i] == 1 ) ulamNumbers.add(i); } } public boolean isUlamNumber(int n ){ return ulamNumbers.contains(n); } public static void main (String[] args) { UlamNumbers ulamNumbers = new UlamNumbers(1000); System.out.println(ulamNumbers.isUlamNumber(1)); System.out.println(ulamNumbers.isUlamNumber(2)); System.out.println(ulamNumbers.isUlamNumber(3)); System.out.println(ulamNumbers.isUlamNumber(4)); System.out.println(ulamNumbers.isUlamNumber(5)); System.out.println(ulamNumbers.isUlamNumber(983)); System.out.println(ulamNumbers.isUlamNumber(984)); } } 
Yeah, what Fuco1337 said. Memoization is a general programming technique. Basically you avoid computation by saving results of previous computations. So you're using extra memory to use less processing. Readability: you'll eventually find that making you code more readable actually saves you in the long run. I understand why it's a little ugly in the beginning though...sometimes it's faster to just hack something out to see if it works. I do this myself when I'm prototyping and I've been programming Java professionally for 10+ years. 1 hour is pretty good. It seems like a good interview question :)
Because Oracle sued Google last year. IMHO that's the only real reason.
&gt;E.Swing application framework Really ? We had JSR-296... until SUN let it dies because Java FX was to be the new future... 
I run nomachine into my headless Debian box and run my IDE of choice through an xterm session. This works no matter where I am as long as I have connectivity and it doesn't stress out my laptop since the real work is offloaded. I personally would never want to store my code remotely where someone else could theoretically have control of it.
That's sort of a big deal. The licensing terms make Java distasteful or even dangerous to a large portion of the community (Google, Apache, etc.).
The real question should be why did everyone sell out their values and vote yes...even though Oracle said they would pass java 7 regardless IMO it would have been more of a vocal stand by the community instead of voting yes with comments, to vote no. Basically Google is the only company that showed they have balls.
Write some open source code that does something important to you that you can show off.
Well, how *else* would you end a foreach loop early? For other loops, while or for, if you find that you want to be able to end the loop early, you have a choice of: while(mainCondition) { doStuff(); if(earlyBreakCondition()) break; } or, boolean doneEarly = false; while(mainCondition &amp; !doneEarly) { doStuff(); if(earlyBreakCondition()) doneEarly=true; } So, I say the first is easier to read and understand. ***HOWEVER***, if it's a big loop, if you find there are multiple reasons to break early and more than one break going on, especially weirdly nested breaks, then I think you should then scrap it all, figure out a simpler flow of logic for the whole thing. So, in other words, I use breaks/continues aplenty, and if it starts being a problem, it's a good indication the whole thing needs to be rethought.
I hope you're not using 1.4 *and* 1.5 at the same company...
Do you have any more info? What specific terms were they unhappy with?
Yep, and I've even been shot down pushing them onto a new jdk too. Lets put it this way...it's a very political place and you'd need some hattori hanzo kanatas to cut through the red tape. But that and other reasons are why I'm looking at other options :D
Very good list! I can't emphasize enough Effective Java. It is the book that the developers of Java needed to read before Java 1. I Use a lot of what's in therefor interview questions. In addition to reading, you really can't beat writing code. You need to live and breathe code for a couple of years to build an expertise in it. Find an open source project. Read the code that more experienced people write and try to understand why they designed it that way. Another regular interview question I ask is have someone design the HashMap class. I don't expect them to know all the ins and outs of HashMap, but I expect them to know the major points (equals vs hash code, bucketing, get/put method, underlying data structure). 
... which is why my code example is based on ``j.u.logging`` ;)
Hmm... ``SLF4J`` looks *very* interesting. Didn't know about it yet. So far, I am happy with ``j.u.logging``. So far it covered all the bases ;)
&gt; I personally would never want to store my code remotely where someone else could theoretically have control of it. Very true! For me, all my code is in git repositories which I host in private repos. Those repos are available online via ssh, so pretty much anywhere I am, I can access them in a *secure* manner :) Sometimes I also find [`sshfs`][1] very handy.

These certificates are only useful say if you've been working as a C# developer for a few years and wish to get a job in Java. It could then show you can apply you're skills you already have to Java. If you get this certificate to _get a job_, I will hit you.
Isn't item C (Strings in switch, binary integral literals and underscores in numeric literals, multi-catch and more precise rethrow, improved type inference for generic instance creation (diamond), try-with-resources statement, simplified varargs method invocation) already included in JDK 7?
I've not had a problem like your's with the colour highlighting though so I'd maybe try a re-install. Either that or it's not compiling your java classes correctly. Seems like it can't see that the file is a java file.
Well to be honest I do code everything by hand. Every GUI-Editor I tried so far brings a huge overhead of code with it, which I didn't like at all. So I can't really recommend a good one. IMHO though coding by hand makes you understand the core Swing components much faster than any GUI-Editor could.
Java is a platform independent and object oriented language. Java application development increases efficiency and productivity. It also provides solution for mobile phones and gaming.
Then use a while with a proper condition, not a for loop.
Then use a while with a proper condition, not a for loop.
Yes they are. See http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk7/features/#f618
I did my certifications about 10 years ago (with Sun), but my experience was that the *developer* certification was definitely worth getting. The programmer certification is a prerequisite for the developer certification. I was a consultant at the time - and just mentioning that i just got the developer certification meant the interviewer just said "oh, ok", and gave me the job. Where the programmer certification can be passed just by reading a book, the developer certification actually has you develop an application, and you also have to reason about your choices and prove your understanding of your code. 
I thinks this is more a philosophical question than anything else. I feel like you could always design your code to avoid a situation where you could make use of a break statement. The question is: why would you iterate with a foreach loop at all if you need to break out of a certain condition early. Why not use a while loop instead?
these features for jdk 7 but two more features are not in jdk 7 : 1.An omnibus proposal for better integral literals 2.Language support for Collections 
&gt;Basically Google is the only company that showed they have balls. Um no. Probably because they are getting sued.
Can you tell me more about the developer certification. IE do you have the link to the page?
What does getting sued have to do with voting yes or no on java 7? 
Several votes were like that. http://www.jroller.com/scolebourne/entry/java_se_7_passes_in Here's some food for thought... Before Oracle bought Sun, they were siding with Apache and wanted the TCK licensing changed. Now that they own Java, they won't do it. That makes me think that before Oracle bought Sun they wanted the licensing changed so they could fragment the platform and push their own products at Sun's expense. Now that Oracle owns Java they don't want anyone detrimenting the platform in the same way. I hate what Oracle has done with some of Sun's stuff (Open Solaris now closed), but in this case, I don't entirely disagree with what they're doing. Even though Apache is well intentioned, that's not going to do much to prevent someone else from intentionally (or unintentionally) hurting the Java brand by fragmenting it with a 'compatible for now' runtime.
But what if intermittent calculations indicate the loop needs to stop (break) or go to the next value (continue) *now*, based on information you didn't have at the top of the current iteration? Example - say your loop has a mechanism to provide a degree of randomness to the processing and if "Math.random&lt;0.15" log something and go onto the next item in the loop. It makes total sense to do that inline and the code is readable. You could probably restructure it, but that would be a whole lot harder to read. I'm not saying pepper your code with them, but I argue they do have their place. 
How often do you log things based on random integers? Come on, that argument is worthless...
Is this what we are comparing? for ( int i=0; &lt;loop-condition&gt;; i++ ) { if ( &lt;another-condition&gt; ) break; if ( &lt;another-condition2&gt; ) continue; } Versus int i = 0; while ( &lt;loop-condition&gt; ) { if ( &lt;another-condition&gt; ) break; if ( &lt;another-condition2&gt; ) continue; i++; } OR int i = 0; while ( true ) { if ( &lt;loop-condition&gt; ) break; if ( &lt;another-condition&gt; ) break; if ( &lt;another-condition2&gt; ) continue; i++; } OR int i = 0; while ( &lt;loop-condition&gt; &amp;&amp; !&lt;another-condition&gt; &amp;&amp; &lt;another-condition2&gt; ) i++; } Why not the following? for ( int i=0; &lt;loop-condition&gt; &amp;&amp; !&lt;another-condition&gt; &amp;&amp; &lt;another-condition2&gt;; i++ ) { } 
http://metro.java.net/ Yes. Use jaxb. They've got great maven hooks, and you really can't go wrong. Apache axis is also a great one, but I like the marshalling and unmarshalling of Jax-B more. 
Look at Apache Avro, it may be useful for you. It is the messaging system used by Hadoop, Apache's MapReduce project. It allows you to define classes in json, and generate the class code in a number of languages: Java, C/C++, Python, C#, Ruby, and PHP. Avro will serialize objects to either binary or json, and can deserialize in any of the supported languages. If a receiving application doesn't have a generated avro class, it can accept the json schema and deserialize objects into a generic record.
Right now I'm dabbling in JME also, I haven't made anything interesting with it past a tic tac toe game in my spare time during work. See where it brings you and if you like it, and if you don't go back to doing more of the work.
Thanks so much! I will take your advice.
Thanks! Now that you mention it, tic tac toe would be a good idea for me. =)
Yaeh, it is very easy to set up and make with the tutorials on their site as guides.
Excellent. I'm following them right now. It's nice to have a website with such nicely-formatted and presented tutorials. A lot better than some of the black and whites that I've seen.
Dont forget tool development. Pick up some GUI building skills to help with this. (Netbeans has a great one built in) For example, I made a stupid small RPG final fantasy 1 style, and made a map editor program that just outputs a map file so I dont have to endlessly spank an array in code. Instead, I run the map editor, click here and there, then save the map. If you want some of my notes on the netbeans comment I made just ask and Ill post them here, that should get you started and is a GREAT shortcut.
Sounds neat! And yes, I'd love for you to post them.
I think you'd benefit a lot from Groovy
If you can look past the optical-illusion-metaphor intro and the silly jokes, these are actually some good Java puzzlers. Also, for the tl;dw people, the slides are [here](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B941PmRjYRpnYmM1MjJkMjYtNjc2Yy00ODkwLTkxMmItZmJjZDRlZGM3OWRj&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CKLvsOsB&amp;pli=1)
Yes GUI is a very good thing to learn, I've been slowly dabbling with making a server for one of my games and that got me learning how to do most gui to a point fairly well. Lots of Grid and Border layouts (gridbag is mean)
I've been doing java for ages now and jME looks really good going forward. I was trying some open GL tutorials for javascript but I find them quite mind boggling. 
I got mine through Sun (SCJP for Java 5) a year or so ago and was definitely not a fan. The company I work for got a discount price on Java training for the exam and a free pass for one exam through some state program so they wanted us to all go through the training at least. That wasn't so bad, but those of us who took the course had been doing Java for a little while now (2-10 years and I was at the bottom of that list) and were interested in expanding our knowledge more than proving we knew how to use Java. The training was all about the 'gotchas' rather than how to become better at Java. Fortunately the training was thorough enough and the sample tests were hard enough to make the actual exam easy(ish), but they entire time through I felt like I would've benefited more from writing Java than studying for this exam. Having said that, I did pick up more on the nuances of the Collections library and got a better understanding of threading. Therefore, I can't discount the process entirely. So to address your questions. I won't think any more of a programmer if they have a cert, but I won't count it against them. They at least know how the compiler works in tricky situations. The studying did increase my knowledge, but I didn't think it was the biggest bang for my time (ymmv) Will it get you over an HR hump in the hiring process? Our company justified the training cost by saying we'd have a certification at the end of it, so it's gotta help. Best of luck! Make sure you take plenty of practice tests and study harder than you think. You can't walk in and ace this even if you've done Java for 10 years. Many in our group did fail (but passed the second time around)
Tell them Oracle would gladly take piles of cash from them with "Java for Business" next time they crash and that might steer them into the right direction ;-)
Hope it works out for you!
This will be very interesting for me as, like I said above, before I worked with Java I spent a long time coding in VB.NET. A lot of the applications I created were actually Windows Form Applications. I have plenty of practice in form building itself, but only a little bit of practice with doing it in Java, which is different.
If you want to develop for desktop and Android simultaneously (and why wouldn't you?), check out [Libgdx](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/). It's awesome.
Heres the bit on Netbeans (7) GUI code to Eclipse usable / editable code. -------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------- How to generate SWING code for use in Eclipse with NetBeans 7 -------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------- Create a new project in Netbeans. Right click on the project name (should be bold), choose New -&gt; JFrame Form Default settings are ok, click Finish This should put you in Design Mode for the form. Drag out and configure the widgets from the Palette and create the action listeners. To add the action code, double click the element. Go into Source Mode, and copy all the text. Go into Eclipse, and paste the code into a new class with the same name as the class code you just copied. Make sure your project package is correct. Test it in eclipse (F-11) -------------------------------------------------------------- Notes: -------------------------------------------------------------- Feel free to cut out the unnecessary bits. You can also import stuff to cut down on the java.abc.def.whatever stuff. Action Listeners : They get attached when the element is created. Ex : jButton1.setText("Reset"); jButton1.addActionListener(new ActionListener() { public void actionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent evt) { jButton1ActionPerformed(evt); } }); Later, just above the main(), you get that function : private void jButton1ActionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent evt) { //handle the event } 
You don't like Netbeans for coding? :)
I suspect they are breaking up their simulation in small steps, and at each step drawing a line from the start to end point, without ever clearing the "canvas". With enough resolution in the timestep it should result in a pretty smooth picture.
You could also use monitors so that the thread waits until there is something to do instead of using a loop that takes CPU time to determine if there is something to do. This can also be used to limit processing to one worker thread at a time. ... //This doesn't really have the be a Queue. processingQueue = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue&lt;T&gt;(); ... public synchronized void addToProcessQueue(T t){ processingQueue.add(t); //When something is added to the queue notify the thread, waking them up from wait status. //notifyAll will cause all current threads to wake up. Can also use notify notifyAll(); } public void run() { while(true){ process(); } } private synchronized void process(){ if(this.processingQueue.size() == 0){ try { //If the queue is empty block until there is something to do wait(); } catch (InterruptedException e) { //handle interupt } } //this is hit only when there is something to do. //processing will continue as long as there are items in the processQueue //when it hits zero again it will wait. //processing work here }
Is that something that can be done within a paint method?
Eclipse seemed better to me when I evaluated the two about a year ago. I dont remember why. *edit : I think it had something to do with syntax highlighting in python and / or php.
Great great great presentation! I've always been a proponent of variable.equals("string"), but I knew the other way around is supposed to be more clear (old habits die hard). This presentation definitely got me thinking of everything that could happen and how I could not get around to everything if I wanted to.
I am partial to Eclipse as well. It might just be due to the fact that it what I am most comfortable with because I've used it the longest.
Thanks a bunch!
The API you're looking for is [Java 2D](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/index.html). Extend [JComponent](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/JComponent.html). Override [`paintComponent()`](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/JComponent.html#paintComponen(java.awt.Graphic\)). Cast the Graphics argument to a [Graphics2D](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics2D.html). You probably just want to draw the projectile path in small, straight-line segments. `paintComponent()` should simply draw some kind of Projectile object as it is (being the "view"), not changing its state. You could potentially get fancy with Bézier curves, with [Path2D](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/geom/Path2D.html), but it's really not useful here. In a separate thread from the event thread (where `paintComponent()` runs), like your main thread, you step through the simulation (model+controller), using `Thread.sleep()` between steps. At each step, call `repaint()` -- generally through the [observer pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern), where your JComponent observes your model -- on your JComponent, which is a call for it to repaint asynchronously. 
I strongly disagree on Clean Code and Clean Coder. A better book to replace the former is Implementation Patterns by Kent Beck. Honestly, it's *much* better than Clean Code. I don't understand the recommendation for Clean Coder at all. It's a series of anecdotes from Bob Martin's past from which he draws few, if any, insights. 
Evaluate [Spring Web Services](http://static.springsource.org/spring-ws/site/reference/html/tutorial.html#tutorial-creating-project) and try to avoid generating Java classes. I work on a system where I connect many different (and extensive) web services, and I use JDOM and XPath to map web service to my own model and from my own model back to different XML protocol. In this way, I avoid the step where you map one Java model into another Java model - or worse, each of the several Java models into all other Java models. Or, if that's not useful, instead of trying to find something to map one Java model to another by defining mappings through XML, why not use XSLT to map XML to XML directly?
Wow, I didn't hear about that one. That sounds like an awful idea.
What makes you think that? It's not like it's exposing anything extra, just adding a little nicer api. That way you could always do something like new Thing().setPropA('a).setPropB('b')
Hm, that's true. Here's what I'm thinking. This is a contrived example, but: class AwesomeNumber { int theNumber; public AwesomeNumber(int n) { this.theNumber = n; } public void add(AwesomeNumber other) { this.theNumber += other.theNumber; } public AwesomeNumber plus(AwesomeNumber other) { return new AwesomeNumber(this.theNumber + other.theNumber); } The intention here is that `a.plus(b)` returns a *new* `AwesomeNumber`, leaving a and b unchanged, but `a.add(b)` *modifies* a. If I mix them up and write `a.add(b).add(c)`, the compiler won't let you do it. With this change, it would let you do it without even a warning.
I think this is a good point. I think personally I'm going to try to make it a point going forward that instead of writing void methods I'll just have them return this when it makes the api easier (especially with setters). I agree it might not be best all the time.
Hey - you could use Processing - www.processing.org
Like others have said, use Java 2D or Processing. Processing.org has enough tutorials to get you through all of this...
Just in case Google isn't your friend. [Java Tutorial » 2D Graphics » Image - 16. 26. 2. Resize an image](http://www.java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0261__2D-Graphics/Resizeanimage.htm) 
Go into fullscreen mode and simply set your resolution to 640x480...all in java. [fullscreen exclusive mode](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/fullscreen/exclusivemode.html) this will set you on that path.
If you are heading into game or graphics programming I suggest looking up [Slick 2D](http://slick.cokeandcode.com/) based on the [LWJGL (Light Weight Java Game Library)](http://lwjgl.org/) The performance is an order of magnitude faster than Java2D.
Mind linking to them? I can't seem to find them on their site. Is this a good engine for 2d games?
Another JVM language? What is that, the third so far this year?
It's like anyone who has a keyboard has started to write a new language for JVM.
I wrote two this morning!
Why use ":" to separate variable name and type? Why not just use whitespace like Go. So much cleaner, so much less noise which enters the retina and must be processed by the brain.
This is the essence of why it's so very hard to like Oracle. It's the lengths they go to for their completely sterile image, one in which every single employee is one with the whole and all is harmony. It's been hard to see former Sun people fall in line and become more focused on marketing than tech. Take the [Java Spotlight podcast](http://blogs.oracle.com/javaspotlight) - on the face of it a very nice community-focused effort where they talk about recent developments and interview interesting people. But although there are multiple people discussing, they speak with a single voice, always. Everything is fine, and will be even finer "moving forward"! And it's so over-edited that it's basically an audible ransom note where every word is stitched together and moved around in post. The poor editor sometimes makes mistakes, so you get situations like this: "So, what's new this week? [*silence*] Great, thank you!"
Go's approach is so god-awful ugly, that thankfully no one else uses it.
Next thing you know, Oracle employees will be asked to tell their children bedtime stories of how Larry Ellison was given the first Java compiler on Mount Sinai.
So true. Not to mention.. suing Google instead of competing on merit. They should try working half as hard at improving JME as they do being litigious bastards and deleting valid posts.
Also if anybody has some other code suggestions that would be great. I just started a couple weeks ago and I'm learning as I go.
I'd recommend you maintain aspect ratio, though. Many people get extremely irritated when the aspect ratio is incorrect, and aside from that it leads to false senses of distances.
http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/menu.html
I see no code for a main menu. What have you done so far? Also the fullscreen you're using seems to be borked. I ran it on my PC, ran alright, was able to drag the window to a second monitor, but the full screen stayed on my main monitor, and didnt go away once closing the application. Had to CTRL+ALT+DEL to get rid of it.
I think he means main menu in the 'hit escape, menu pops up in the middle of the screen' sense.
You are correct. 
There is no main menu code yet, I ended up deleting everything that I have tried so far (none of it has worked properly). All of the work I have done is the code I have provided as well as some stuff for the tiles, units, and map creation. Thanks for letting me know about the fullscreen problem, I don't have a dual monitor setup so I would never have discovered that on my own. I'm also having trouble adding buttons to the game, these problems must all be related to a basic misunderstanding I have about how this works.
If anyone has suggestions on what to add to the program please tell me :).
Documentation might help.
I'm not exactly sure what you mean.
http://jmonkeyengine.org/wiki/doku.php/jme3:beginner:hello_simpleapplication For 2d I just go from scratch fairly much but I hear Slick 2D is a big one.
What are we looking at?
&gt;Documentation might help. It would be nice to have an explanation of what you can do with it and why. I think some sample networks would also be nice. Edit: formatting
Yeah I was thinking of adding some sample networks.
The way I have done it in the past is to implement some sort of state-based system. When it is in the MENU state, stop all input to the actual game, but keep rendering it, then draw your menu over top. I have only had to do it once or twice, but when I have done it, all I have done is simple colour fills and/or images to make up the menu, drawing the text over top, then giving each button a bounding box that the mouse checks against to see what button was clicked. If you want something simpler, do away with the mouse input for the menu, and keep it to arrow keys. easier to keep hold of what menu item the user is 'clicking' on without wasting time checking where the mouse is in relation to the bounding boxes.
When I view this on my iPhone I get a blank screen. I guess the page has the applet and only the applet? Some other text would be nice and a 'doesn't work' message too. Thanks. 
Just used this guide for getting started in Slick http://thejavablog.wordpress.com/2008/06/08/using-slick-2d-to-write-a-game/ Really, really, helpful and easy to use. Thank's a lot man!
Needs a demo, tutorial, or *some* form of documentation. Also, some of the text at the top is disappearing off the edge.
On a related note, if you're encountering memory leaks and using the JRockit or HotSpot JVM (I think they added this in Java 5, but definitely there in 6), you can set the JVM property: -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError to automatically generate a heap dump when an OOM error occurs. Then you can use something like Eclipse Memory Analyzer to analyze the heap dump and figure out what's causing the problem.
Um, perhaps you could explain what it is and what it does? Also, isn't it a "neural network", not a "neuron network"?
Thank you very much for taking time writing the above code . I have been trying to understand what you did ... but I couldn't . would you please, explain it ? "comment in each loop, line" Thanks again :)
I your screen size is small, thanks for the feedback.
Yes, I'm only at 1920x1280. The default Java font depends on the system. Some operating systems have default fonts that are just a little bit wider.
I would start with spring source documentation , or follow one of their exmaples. http://static.springsource.org/docs/Spring-MVC-step-by-step/
If it was your first course, and you had no prior knowledge of it, it would most likely be too difficult.
Thank you very much.
I'm not sure how well you know Java, but just in case you don't already have it, the JDK API Docs are always a good reference. Of course you can't easily use them to learn Java, but once you get going, they're an invaluable resource. Java SE 6: [http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/index.html](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/index.html) Java EE 6: [http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/index.html](http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/index.html)
Much appreciated. I was planning on buying some quick reference books for Java and AS3.
Not at all -- that's exactly how I got into freelancing years ago. Good luck and feel free to hit me up with any questions!
Can you maybe PM me an example of a freelancing job that would be suitable for someone who has good java foundations? Or maybe a common freelancing job that seems to come up? I'm a bit nervous to just volunteer for something that I may or may not be able to complete. 
Was there something wrong with the tutorial linked from the page where you found this image? http://www.oscaralexander.com/tutorials/how-to-make-sexy-buttons-with-css.html
Well presumably the problem is that that is a tutorial for HTML, and this is presumably for Swing.
It's been a while since I've done GUI work, but you can modify JButton to make it render in the way that you want, or you can use a Look &amp; Feel to make the button look as you want. The Nimbus Look &amp; Feel seems to allow skinning, which should let you make a button that looks precisely how you want, without having to go through the work of creating a new look and feel. http://www.jasperpotts.com/blog/2008/08/skinning-a-slider-with-nimbus/
Start with something tiny. Do it because it interests you, not because it pays. Repeat until your confidence is strong.
Also check out vworker.com
You should extend BasicButtonUI class, than you can override methods paint, paintText, paintButtonPressed and draw whatever you want. Then set new UI to the button using setUI method from JButton class. 
Are you really talking about Java, maybe javascript? I hardly imagine how can java be used in web design.
I have done some freelance work on elance.com. I tried some other sites like it (ifreelance.com, getacoder.com) that didn't work for me at all. I don't know freelancer.com. But don't expect too much pay from them, at most $2000 a month if you work full time, you're competing with Indians and Pakistanis. When working on premises I make a lot more.
Good suggestion, I will add it to the article.
Java + Web = [Wicket](http://wicket.apache.org/)
I subscribed. Nothing happen.
they need _more_ money
This right here. Assumed it was the same thing. Now I know.
Much obliged sir.
Answer: No I do not. And developing in the web-app space on Tomcat or JBoss ensures it.
javascript != java
The example is dodgy. If you're taking a List as an argument you should take a copy of it within the constructor. Otherwise the creator can mess with the internals of the object after it has been created.
If I were you, I would try to at least get an internship first. There is so much you can learn from good coworkers. Then after some real world work experience would be a much better time to go freelance.
Nothing there. What am I supposed to see besides a logo?

Better have Address being an encapsulated list class, where you make it immutable.

As someone who is currently teaching my nephew to program, I have to agree that there aren't many places to find middle ground. The whole programming field is geared toward people taking classes, but there are alternatives. I would suggest that you get a 1 month subscription to [Safari](http://safaribooksonline.com/Corporate/Index/requestInfo-Enterprise.php?cid=201003-sem-google-Safaricorp) and look through the extensive collection of books there and decide after perusing some of them. I personally have kept a Safari subscription for more than 4 years now, and I use it like crazy. Having access to that many reference books is extremely powerful.
What prevents you from pasting more than a few pages of data? Do you get an error in the form of an Exception? Does your program have large memory requirements that need to be specified as additional arguments passed to the Java VM? 
The program does nothing when the larger bits of info are passed. No errors are thrown. The program is still responsive, ie I can still paste a smaller amount of data and it will process it correctly. There may be large memory requirements, how much is large? And do you know how I could pass those arguments on?
It depends on whose VM you are using. If you are using Sun/Oracle JVM, look at -Xms (minimum heap size) and -Xmx (maximum heap size). Although I suspect you would get an error if you exceeded the default limits in the first place...
Hopefully this means the end to 27 different versions of Java in my browser???
I believe recent versions of the JRE clear out older versions automatically.
Hmmm, is there another VM I could download do you think? I might have to install the IDE and SDK again just to get this going (or run this month's reports in one month batches going back a year for each of the three sites *shudder*) The program has been rock solid, among different computers (hmmm maybe I'll check some non-imaged machines that might have a slightly older version of Java) 
IBM and Apache both have their own flavours of Java (Stay away from GNU's version though), each with its own quirks. But I'm not sure how trying different versions of VMs could get you around your current situation, especially since there's no error message.
Now we're up to 28!!!
Shouldn't 5 minutes be enough?
Check out section G of http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/license/index.html and table 1.1 in http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/products/index.html It appears that the Java 7 SE package does not contain the "Commercial Features" cf [here] (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/products/index.html), but why then does the license contain SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE TERMS section A?
worked for me after a minute. the groovy music made it worth it.
I see mostly JRocket stuff. That isn't surprising at all. None of those affect me.
And I guess it doesn't affect a lot of users. It is unclear to me if the SE package contains the features cf http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/products/index.html but the license precludes anyone from using it. To add to the confusion [this](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/java-se-product-editions-397069.pdf) doc, states that some packages available for download contain "Commercial Features".
Considering that Oracle is a piece of shit... this was expected
Java 7 actually released!? Next thing you know Duke Nukem Forever will be finished! ...oh, wait...
I just did a [post](http://www.spyfoos.com/index.php/2011/07/28/oracle-java-7-and-commercial-features/) explaining the issue in greater detail. 
Just have to wait for the OSx version to be finished now :o(
Thanks a lot for the site. I'm gonna sign up as soon as I get my paycheck! 
One comment he made was kind of worrying, about how the EE classloader would look at itself first to load classes, then to the parent. Dos that mean if you managed to inject a class named, say, String, to a running app you could essentially poison the use of Strings (by say, sending every string to a webserver to use in a dictionary attack later)? Seems worrying.
Glad to be of assistance!
You are welcome, I added comments. I hope that helps. The is idea is leveraging the definition of Ulam numbers that limits an Ulam number to the sum of 2 distinct earlier terms. Here is another way to describe it. Assume we know all Ulam numbers less than and equal to N. N is Ulam. The set of all Ulam numbers less than N is (a1,a2,..,ax-1,ax). So there are x Ulam numbers less than N. for ( 1 to x ) ai + N := PotentiallyUlam ( +1 ) If we have done this with all the numbers less than N, then we can safely determine if N+1 is only one sum of Ulam numbers, none, or many. Also it will tell us of numbers greater than N+1 are potentially Ulam. ( Potentially Ulam is a term I am using that means the number is the sum of two distinct Ulam numbers, but may be the sum other distinct pairs as well ). Since we have done the above for each number less than N starting with 2, we can be confident that we visited all the distinct pairs of Ulam numbers less than N. It is also important to understand that ai + N = N + ai. Since addition is transitive, we don't need do the following for ( i 1 to N ) for ( j 1 to N ) Instead we can do for ( i 1 to N ) for ( j i+1 to N ) So that we don't have to visit array[i] + array[j] and array[j] + array[i]. This also has a added advantage that we know all the combinations of numbers less than i have already been visited. We know that in the first more brute approach as well, but in that situation we have to deal with duplicates. So maybe a better way to put it is that this optimization prevents the need to consider duplicates. 
To determine why you code is taking so long, try to calculate the number of iterations it will go through: find &lt;- 1000 or O(n) findUlams first loop &lt;- n^2 findUlams sort &lt;- I assume this is n^2 log n^2 findUlams second loop &lt;- n^2 findUlams third loop &lt;- n^2 * n = n^3 Since you call findUlams n times, then we can just say that you have O(n^4 ) I think. I just took the biggest O(n^3 ) from findUlams and multiplied it by n. So that is more than 1000^4 calculations -&gt; 1,000,000,000,000+ calculations needed. ( or more than 1 trillion ) When n is 500 you need more than 500^4 calculations or more than 62,500,000,000. If 62 billion calculations took 30 seconds, I estimate that it would take ( 1000^4 / 500^4 ) * 30 seconds or about ( 8 minutes ) to complete the calculation for 1000. 
Available, but [buggy](http://www.lucidimagination.com/blog/2011/07/28/dont-use-java-7-for-anything/).
Buggy, but a command-line switch provides an interim fix.
since it is an "intro." i don't think it will be a problem (but i also think XHTML, XML, and CSS won't help a lot) 
hard to say, I would suggest that you have a basic understanding of programing concepts, flow control mechanisms, data encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, etc. Normally these things are covered in an intro to programing course utilizing pseudo code or python; it may be that this is essentially what this java course is only using java instead. read the description, is it recommended for people new to programming like your self (xhtml and css are not programming).
I am just completing a javascript course. I went through the tutorials on youtube done by a called bucky. His channel is called [TheNewBoston](http://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston) I watched each tutorial then spent a bit time between each one playing around with what I learned. Once I started the course I found it quite easy. I am starting a Java course in February and plan on doing the same.
I recommend the head first java book http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Java-Kathy-Sierra/dp/0596009208. It would help a lot to read through some of it before starting your class, or while taking your class. The whole Head First series is great and an easy read. It will make some of the trickier programming concepts easier to understand.
Intro course means they will teach you everything you need to know without assuming any previous knowledge. Also the fact that you're actively thinking and worried about it already puts you above 90% of the class in terms of commitment, and that's half the battle. If you don't understand something, ask the professor.
I would also add Bruce Eckel's [Thinking in Java](http://www.mindview.net/Books/TIJ/) to that. It does a nice job of covering basic Java and programming skills.
It should be fine, but feel free to study up on the core concepts of Object-Oriented (OO) programming.
Why don't just put the data in a File and read in from that?
Not sure I'd call this a "vulnerability" per se, but it is an interesting attack vector that most classes aren't prepared for. I'm sure there are some nasty things that could be done with "unconstructed" object instances.
Well, his page got hits.
If someone has this to that level of access to your system, I'd be pretty worried. Even beyond this attack vector, reflection could probably be used to do nasty things to any class instance.
I could do that, but I don't have the IDE anymore, and am not technically supposed to use it due to policy. I ended up just exporting the files one or two months at a time, and adjusting my method so that each month I'll just bring in records since the last day. (Also checked on someone's computer and the program still runs fine, so maybe another Java update will fix it again lol)
Excellent article, playing with the example really freaked me out. The explanation was really interesting.
It is a well known fact that most libraries implement the Linear Congruential Method. It is also well known that pseudo-random sequences will repeat the exact same sequece every time it's started with the same salt. So this article basically shows bad usage of the Random class.
I'm currently learning Java from the HeadFirst series, and it's very interesting. I'm not sure if it's the best or the most detailed book, but for a beginner, it sure is very good. 
And as always, if you are using random numbers for anything important (like session IDs), you should be using [SecureRandom](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/security/SecureRandom.html).
&gt;It is also well known that pseudo-random sequences will repeat the exact same sequece every time it's started with the same salt. This is wrong.
In the example every time it is started with different salt and still gives th same result. How do you explain this?
Oh well. Stupid site doesn't even have a way to contact the owner to report the fail. I'm not going to bother hunting down email addresses from DNS.
&gt; This is wrong. I realise you're just trolling, but for others who may be curious, here's how random numbers are generated in 99.9% of languages: X{n+1} = (aXn + c) mod m There is no magic in there, if you start with the same data, you end up with the same sequence.
&gt; In the example every time it is started with different salt and still gives th same result. How do you explain this? X{n+1} = (aXn + c) mod m The class either varied a, c or m, or a combination of them, whatever you wish to call a salt.
&gt; ...and am not technically supposed to use it due to policy. Does your company give a reason for handicapping their developers?
I'm not quite following your example - are you saying that a malicious user could inject a new definition of a class through a webapp and poison its classloader through that?
Just part of the project to have a single computer image, locked down security, and ultimately all apps installed by SCCM. I did go and redo my program in C# today, making an Excel Plugin which was a useful excercise. Works good! I'm not a developer per se, just an IT/MIS guy that was tired of going through exported excel files and cleaning out all the page headers, and such so I could produce a report. The worst thing Excel would do is interpret some of our materials as scientfic notation, in a non-communtative way. So as part of parsing I stick a **'** in front of the material code so Excel **knows** it's text! However it has a lot of hardcoded stuff whereas my Java program had a GUI and a whole editing kit for creating/loading/saving profiles. So I had profiles for parsing various transactions in SAP (so I had like MB51.ini, MB52.ini, MM60.ini and so forth), my new program just gives me a handy right click function in Excel, "paste MB51". And tomorrow I'll probably have "paste MB52". 
Say an app using the EE classloader loaded plugins from a folder by loading the class files in the folder. If a class named String was put in that folder, wouldn't it get used instead of java.lang.String when using Strings?
Maybe you should try to read better before calling other people trolls. The example didn't use the same salt. So you were wrong.
Excepting that java.lang is a protected package.... java.lang.SecurityException: Prohibited package name: java.lang :) I see your point and, yes, it is, potentially a problem if you're letting untrusted parties contribute source code to your project - but that's why you don't let untrusted third parties modify the source of your code.
Good point, I didn't think of that. I guess you're right that managing your source properly would negate the problem.
How about: * One way connections. * Different kinds of neurons, input, "hidden"/middle layer and output * Weights on inputs. * Thresholds for activation of a neuron * Different kinds of activations function when a neuron is trigured: 0,1, 1/(1+e^-netinput). * Training: take a look at backpropogation, ways of adjusting to weights on the input connections to a neuron relating to the error from some kind of training pattern. * A way of visualising the error in the system, how the output differs from some ideal pattern. Take a look at Perceptrons and multilayer networks. You might find [JavaNNS](http://www.ra.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/software/JavaNNS/) worth a look for inspriation.
I just want to say that this is one of the most awesome things I've seen in a while. I will definitely be using this.
Great find!
Holy fuck yes. Class -&gt; pom entry so quickly... it's glorious. 
Neat! Just today I wished I had something just like that.
There you go, keep trolling.
Personally I'm not a fan of the head first series, but they're very popular so it seems others prefer them. I find the organization a bit distracting, however I am comfortable with traditional textbooks. To each his own.
http://www.geekpoint.net/business-discussion/5886-70-alternatives-rentacoder.html
That's I'm learning from too, I think they are good for someone who knows almost nothing to start(which was me). I couldn't really follow other books.
That's I'm learning from too, I think they are good for someone who knows almost nothing to start(which was me). I couldn't really follow other books.
I like the concept of the Head First series, and might even give "Design Patterns" a read based on the many positive reviews, but for learning Java I ultimately went with "Introduction to Java Programming-Comprehensive Version" by Liang. Since the current edition (8th) is a bit pricy, I went with a used copy of the 6th Ed. I should note that I'm not a total newbie, I started programming 28 years ago and have learned quite a few languages, so there is much in the "Introduction" that is well covered ground, but the way I look at it I would rather skim over the parts I'm proficient at than potentially skip things I need to get up to speed with. When I started the Head First Java book I never really felt like I was getting the depth of learning I needed to write code, though it might be a good follow-up book for anyone not conformable with some of the concepts behind Java. tl:dr Skip the gimmicky books and dive into a real textbook.
I want re-iterate something DiamondBack suggested/eluded to - Buy used copy of old(er) edition of textbooks. Universities will jump to new versions of books, but for independent study a version or two old will typically be more than sufficient. These books usually wind up on Half.com for a few bucks and are often worth picking up.
&gt; In general this also will affect Java 6 users but only if they use the **optimization options, which are on by default** with Java 7 (-XX:+OptimizeStringConcat or -XX:+AggressiveOpts) These problems were detected only **5 days before the official Java 7 release, so Oracle had no time to fix those bugs.** It shouldn't take 5 days to change an optimization from "on by default" to "off by default" should it?
Ignorance is strength? for(int i = 0; i &lt; 256; i++) { System.out.println(new Random(i).nextInt(8)); }
Have you tried this tutorial? http://java.sun.com/new2java/programming/learn/
Lol, I looked at three projects to test (HtmlUnit, DbUnit and Jetty) and _none_ of them had source available.
Your example doesn't prove anything. Random uses the LCM, either it's changing a, n, c or m - nobody said there wouldn't be collisions, certain combinations of a, c m and n generate same numbers. You can insist all you want with that cheap java 101 code, I happen to know what I'm talking about. The OP shows bad use of Random that is all, this is not new and there is no flaw in it.
Increase max threads to 8, and get an 8-core machine! You could probably get rid of the busy wait (200ms sleep then check), and replace with a .wait() and .notify() setup.
Can someone explain what this provides over www.jarvana.com?
that might help: http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/notification.html
Thanks! Yeah, I did find this in my googling. It was probably going to be what I use, but I figured I'd ask to see if anyone has any experience and uses some other API that they prefer for whatever reason. 
this is another one http://jnotify.sourceforge.net/ (seems to be a wrapper) and you could also use polling :)
Oh nice, thanks! I'll probably do a few in parallel to see what kinds of issues I hit. We have a tool that others are using to do exactly what I want.. but it's error handling is poor. I really need to know what was missed so I can fix it manually and re-process. Our tool doesn't really have a good way of doing that without starting over and doing the entire thing from the beginning. 
&gt; want with that cheap java 101 code That's the actual code snippet everyone is discussing here. Really, why are you behaving like that? It is completely obvious to everyone here that you're wrong this time and your weasel word style of discussion doesn't help anyone.
It really depends on the platform as to how to do it most efficiently. jnotify works on Linux/Windows, but not on other platforms (As far as I know). Additionally, Jnotify has limitations on Linux in that it cannot recursively monitor an entire tree of subdirectories and if also cannot monitor more that a pre-set number of files/directories. You can increase the number of files/directories that can be monitored, but it must be done using ulimit before the application starts running.
I'd suggest looking at the NetBeans IDE.
I would recommend taking the time to learn it. I know how difficult it can be work long hours while getting a degree, but I can promise you that it will be useful. I am not a Mechanical Engineer, but most of my coworkers are. Even if you never have to use Java again, at the very least you will be doing some light programming in some mechanical design/simulation software. Once you learn to program in one language, doing it in another is not too difficult. Life will always be hectic, and time too short. Do yourself a favor and take the time to learn the stuff while you're in school where help is readily available. It will be a lot easier than stumbling around in the dark when you encounter it during your job.
If you're only talking about *web design* (basically front end development), then you'll likely only be dealing with Javascript, not Java. Java generally only comes into play if you do *web development*, which is developing back end systems to interact with the web pages. If you describe what kind of web site you're trying to design, we could tell you what you need to know to make it.
Might be a bit oversized, but [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org/) has an [component](http://camel.apache.org/file2.html) for this
Javascript's definitely what I'm looking for. My ignorance made me think that they're both the same thing.
No, it should not. Looks like nobody gives a shit at Oracle.
Don't!!! This is patented! 
May be looking into the source code of Vuze bittorrent client (formerly Azureus) would help. http://dev.vuze.com/ . Azureus had some pretty fancy update features back in the day I used it. You could update modules individually. Opt-in beta update feature was also there. Google also brings up Java Update Framework (http://sourceforge.net/projects/juf/)
&gt; It is completely obvious to everyone here that you're wrong Really. I see you speak "for everyone here". Random numbers are not supposed to be unique, a string of 1 1 1 1 can be randomly produced. This article is so wrong I can't even start. There is nothing wrong with the Random class. Get over it, move on - I don't care if you think I'm wrong or right, you said I was wrong and I showed why I'm not for your educational purposes. You're using a knife to cut a log, you're using it wrong and you're acting stupid while at it, by insisting on this dumb post. The article is wrong - move on.
Though this may be overkill, the [Netbeans Platform](http://netbeans.org/features/platform/features.html) provides *loads* of features including sophisticated update mechanisms. You can get silent updates where it doesn't even notify the user, but you have to add a bit of extra code (you can easily find it online).
Care to share which patent you think this would infringe?
What desktop management application(s) do you have in-house that you can utilize? SCCM, ZenWorks, that sort of thing. Don't make the app pull its updates down - push them out. These applications also do auditing &amp; reporting so you can track who has been updated and who still needs the upgrade.
Why, you think it will not? 
We use [install4j](http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/install4j/overview.html) which has auto update features as well. They have a library that you can easily integrate to check for updates and ask (or force) the user to update. Hit me up if you want code if you go for this option :)
I'll check those out, thanks. Looks like JUF has no documentation or anything, but I'll see what I can figure out. Thanks!
Thanks for the pointer. This is an internal app used by about 5 people. Not sure I'd be able to justify the cost for this. The app isn't that big, it doesn't take too long to get or anything, I'm just trying to make it more convenient (and learn something new in the process).
The app has built in checks to make sure you're running the current version. It won't even let you login if you're not. I just want the ability to have it pull down the new version. I understand what you're saying about just pushing it out, but it's only used by a handful of people and I don't have any control over the desktop management apps (if we're using them, which I'm not totally sure we are).
In fairness, change management is hard, especially with a large company managing a large project. They probably had the final build locked down for a couple of weeks before release.
You can download a file from a server using input streams. Here's my file download method for example: [Source](http://pastebin.com/4Dv2sNDx). After that, you can just relaunch the jar. 
If it existed, it would be the subject of tech news and developers would cry out in pain as the owner of the patent demand license fees and/or request injunctions. Any patent having a broad claim covering all auto-update would've been filed in the early 90s, and is likely expired by now. I'm not saying no such patent exists, just that I think it is highly unlikely given the present market and prior art history.
for that sort of thing - I have just used a stub, which copies newer files from a network share or web server, replaces them on machine and then launched the application (not tried doing it with Java though)
I guess [Core Java™, Volume I--Fundamentals](http://www.amazon.com/Core-Java-Vol-1-Fundamentals-Addison-Wesley/dp/0132354764/) is a very good starting point. I recommend it always to guys asking me how to start with Java. Then the Vol II for advanced topics. And then Effective Java for best practises. Effective Java is excellent, but you need to have spent at least 1000 hours of programming in Java to fully understand what the book tries to teach you. For a related discussion you might have a look at this [post at stackexchange](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/91629/best-java-book-you-have-read-so-far).
After a bit of research I decided to buy big java. I find it quite straight forward, no needless crap or silly examples. I'm quite happy with it.
[Spring Integration](http://www.springsource.org/spring-integration) has excellent support for processing [files](http://static.springsource.org/spring-integration/reference/htmlsingle/#files) from directories. It treats files like messages and you can transform and route them according to your processing needs. Probably overkill unless you already use Spring.
Lets get a working java 7 first guys. Honestly sometimes I wonder if a fast release schedule is worth it anyway...hell I am using jdk 1.4 1.5 and 1.6 at work. but we're primarily still on 1.5. If the release schedules get faster, I'll be maintaining code across 5-6 different versions of java at once. :( *le pain* Anyway I know it's technically not Oracles fault, but I'd put money this situation is similar to many "enterprises".
Did you try what it said on that page?
The other page. Under "Solutions"
Oh that's nice. I'm still learning from HeadFirst, maybe I'll go to Big Java after this. Good luck! 
Bucky isn't bad at starting but it really is the basics, after you've watch them videos buy a book.
use JDK6.... or install it on ubuntu and run it there.... 
repaint() isn't guaranteed to repaint. Repaint adds a repaint request to a queue, which is then run by an Event Dispatch Thread. Sometimes, several repaint requests are combined into one repaint request so the thread won't have to process several requests in a row. That means you repaint requests are not guaranteed to run immediately after you call them, and will sometimes have unexpected effects. It sounds to me that the problem lays mainly with your listener method. Everytime the listener method runs, it will update the screen. It cannot update the screen *while* the method is running, so it has to wait until the method returns. Try to make it so you only process one event at a time. Can I see your code?
you should just go with java 6 for a while until they get the bugs ironed out of java 7. find a java 6 JDK and just use that. The compiler is named javac.exe, so you can just locate that, usually in a bin directory, and call it directly. you can find older JDKs on oracle's website. you can also uninstall java 7 to remove it if you have already done that. The most important thing to do, if the installer doesnt do it, is to go to the "environment variables" under the advanced tab in system on windows and add the full directory path of the jdk to your PATH variable. then you can call javac -v from the command line and you should see the java version 6 compiler information message, which means you can now compile stuff. netbeans still requires a JDK in order to install it, and eclipse doesn't really get installed.. you just configure the ide to find the jdk for each project. 
I do all my development on Linux but since IT are very militant about Windows, I run VirtualBox with Ubuntu. Nice part is I can just clone a VM drive and create a new VM, install a new version of something major and if things don't work out I just go back to the old VM. * Give it a try, go to www.virtualbox.org, install it. * Get the Ubuntu iso and burn it * From VirtualBox select New and it will ask a few basic questions and then boot the VM * Insert install disk and follow prompts * Congratulations you are a proud owner of a Linux VM without replacing Windows (which has some minor uses in gaming) * Now install Java 7 with whatever IDE you like (eclipse, NetBeans, etc) 
I'd recommend NetBeans' tutorials, and sticking with JDK 6 for now.
(Or the Eclipse RCP)

Hey, thanks for the reply. I got it working by putting the code the listener calls in a separate thread. Now everything updates 1 at a time :) I had to throw some semaphores in too to make sure I didn't have multiple instances of the code running at once. If you want to see the code let me know, I'll put it up on pastebin or something because it's a bit big to put here.

Well, I have been doing the exercises from Big Java which can be quite challenging. It also has some small "programming projects" that basically helps you to create small programs with your newly acquired knowledge. [CondingBat](http://codingbat.com) also seems to be quite popular among redditors. I haven't tried it myself, though. Last, but not least, there is [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) which is my personal favorite. Good luck!
&gt; Is there a good place to learn Java online? No. The best place is inside an IDE with autocomplete, such as eclipse or netbeans. Getting to that point means you already know what things like import, package, and void main(String[] args) means, but I would argue that those things arent so much a 'learn java' thing. It sounds more like you want know stuff like what System.out.print does (actually learning java). You gotta play with it to actually learn it.

I'm not experienced with launching minecraft servers, but you can increase the maximum available heap space allocated to the java VM by using the -Xmx and -Xms VM parameters. When you launch the server jar file, use something like: java -Xms256m -Xmx1024m -jar minecraft.jar That will allocate 256mb to the heap initially, with the option of growing it to 1024m. 
[Teach yourself Java in 21 days.](http://portal.aauj.edu/portal_resources/downloads/programming/teach_your_self_java_in_21_days.pdf) (Free e-book.)
Once you get the basics of Java down, TopCoder is a pretty good way to test your algorithmic skills. You just write an implementation of an algorithm, and get the results back straight away.
My biggest gripe is this: &gt; Make the class final so that it cannot be overridden. This is such a PITA when you're using consumable code (e.g., Spring). It restricts me from using your entire class simply because I want to change the behavior of a method. My experience has been that marking a class "final" is a very small minority of cases, and it only serves to irritate the people who are trying to use your code.
This isn't a java question.
update your graphics drivers. 
Dude, I suggest you to try r/minecraft or the official forums. This is definitely not the right place to ask. That said, maybe updating your graphic card driver would help.
Go Jenkins!
That's a nice feature, but I was expecting more than just one. I don't see why it needs to be 'To be continued.'
As a professional interneteur I'd say that most arguing in any topic is over semantics.
The fine black/brown/amber text on faded yellow background is beautiful.
can i call it pass reference by value?
You're... joking... right?
I would point out that "semantics" means "meaning", which can be pretty important, but I'd just be arguing semantics.
repost.
really, 5 days later? you call me out on a repost......wow
At least there is no arguing over syntax...
ror
And why couldn't you have just used T? 
Because he needed to pass by reference.
That is technically what you are doing, but then that's just pass by value.
I'm fond of calling it "pass by value of the reference" just so that people don't smirk when I say "pass by value". Your way works too.
I usually say pass-by-pointer-value, just because I love the argument that ensues.
Seems like either you're trolling or don't understand how java hard references work. Not sure... but if you're serious, what his class does is implicitly performed by all hard references and the construct is entirely useless.
Hah!
Say "pass by value" and let them smirk. Correct them if you have to.
Yes You are correct. And the next feature now is available. It was too early to post the article on reddit..
You may like [solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color scheme, if you don't already.
Let's just wait ... there will _always_ be someone claiming to know it better.
It's nice to see this set out so clearly. I disagree with the writer on this though: &gt;You program with pointers exactly the same way in Java as you would in C or C++. The syntax is just slightly different (another poor choice in Java's design; *they should have used the same -&gt; syntax for de-referencing as C++*). Using "-&gt;" everywhere is messy. The "." is easier to type, read, and say aloud. If Java also had object/struct/user-defined type things with by-value semantics, you'd need both operators, but as it has only the one type of object (and that is unlikely to change), the distinction in meaning between the two operators doesn't matter much. It's a *faux ami* at first but you get used to it.
Although I understood what Java's object parameters do, I probably have used the wrong "pass by reference" terminology when explaining it. Oh well, most important in the end is knowing the behavior. 
thank you very much
Bro. _Boring!?_ Have you played with OSGi and PDE? That stuff rocks my world.
Yet I logged over 8000 hours into it... must be addictive or something.
I think you need to look up the definition of game.. I suppose in some sense you could look at programming as a game.. but if you find it boring then you should probably question why you're doing it.
Need one for Netbeans now. "It'll do some really cool stuff. When it works in the next version"
There should be an eclipse plugin for [this](http://blog.whiletrue.com/2011/01/what-if-visual-studio-had-achievements/). That would make a nice game out of eclipse.
This is pretty cool. I use Compass with Ruby to generate my CSS. I was looking for java based solution so I could get other developers in my team use it. I will check out your code over the weekend.

There are no complete reference papers out there. Your best bet is to look for separate papers on hot code updates and state transformation (erlang has had hot code update support for ages), session preservation for web apps (serialization and its limitations or stateless approach), database upgrade management. I'm affiliated with LiveRebel (co founder of ZeroTurnaround and technical lead for the product).
You can also check out http://www.javapassion.com/ that covers a range of topics from a beginners POV.
I need something like this in a non-JEE environment. Basically, I want to swap (most of) the classes while keeping a server socket open, so that clients see only a slight delay. Apart from that, there is no state that needs preservation. Would OSGi help in such a scenario?

I just built the pc; ended up just re-installing windows...I think i managed to accidentally click on the 32bit version of java when i initially downloaded it, and even though i deleted it, and re-downloaded the other it still didn't work... I think since i was using CCleaner, it somehow botched the registry, and wouldn't fully uninstall the files, so the 64bit was somehow using certain files from the 32bit... anywho, I posted here wondering if it was a common problem with the program. Thank you anyways though.
I'm about 200 pages into "Thinking In Java" and really like it because it uses C++ to explain a lot of things. If you are at least somewhat familiar with C++ then it's a great book.
I'm not sure if this is the best way to do it, but I believe you can scale the images using an AffineTransform: http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/geom/AffineTransform.html
Scaling the image wouldn't be of much value. I only want a section of it, not a smaller version of the whole.
I second the Core Java books by Horstmann &amp; Cornell, I have both the first and second volume and find them very useful.
You've obviously never played Assassin's Creed.
The GC may not give back the memory to the OS while the JVM process is still running. But once it exits, memory is returned to the OS just like any other process. Don't worry, Java isn't creating zombies inside your system! 
Is there a way to make the GC to run at anytime when we need?
Correct. The JVM maintains its own heap and garbage collects unreachable references in your runtime process, but the OS is doing the same thing. On startup the JVM *reserves* its max heap size from the OS and works inside that heap. When the process is gone, the OS knows what its reserved in memory and reclaims it. There are effectively two memory management systems running, the OS's (malloc) and Java's.
I have a background in java, but it's been a few years, so forgive my ignorance here. It seems as though you should be specifying offsets as well as dimensions eg container.drawImage(sectionImage, offsetX, offsetY, width, height, null); Couldn't you do something like [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3495566/java-image-crop) and [this](http://helpdesk.objects.com.au/java/how-do-i-scale-a-bufferedimage) ? Basically, use a Graphics2D container to display BufferedImages with specified offset and dimension. Feel free to let me know if this is just an ancient way of doing things. I'm just starting to get back into java again.
Yes, but it's NOT recommended
Yes, you can call System.gc, but *don't* do it. GC is an expensive operation, so the JVM can't do it all the time. And there's no need, either. As long as the process has enough free memory it doesn't run GC. Instead, it waits until the heap is fairly full and then runs a GC. As they say, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it".
Calling the gc method suggests that the Java Virtual Machine expend effort toward recycling unused objects in order to make the memory they currently occupy available for quick reuse. When control returns from the method call, the Java Virtual Machine has made a best effort to reclaim space from all discarded objects.
I posted this below but I suppose I wasn't directly answering your question; check the javadoc out for System.gc. Essentially, the answer is no. We can 'suggest' (in the same style as repaint, etc), that System perform garbage collection. But we've really no guarantees about it, at least ostensibly. You could check out the source and dig deeper on this one if you wanted.
Actually according to the JVM specification there is no guarantee that the GC will run. The JVM does not have to honor that command. Only when an OutOfMemory condition occurs is it guaranteed to run. Before someone goes "I tried and you are wrong". I mean it is part of the spec, so while it may work in one JVM, there is no guarantee it will run in all. 
I know, but in practice it does seem to work. Certainly it takes a long time to run. If you call it several times in a row it seems to trigger a full GC (as opposed to just new generation GC).
Let me take this a litte towards java ME. I have experienced with a symbian phone that when i work with a java app a low memory error occurs.(i have heard it is normal in symbian.) Doesn't the GC clean the memory there? 
It sounds like your question is to try and answer a problem you're having. What's the underlying problem? Why are you worried about GC running intermittently?
An OutOfMemoryError occurs when there simply is no more memory left to allocate new objects. It's not a symptom of garbage collection (GC is _guaranteed_ to occur before an OutOfMemoryError occurs), but it might be a symptom of having a leak: the GC can't remove certain objects because there are still references to them. Can you get a heap dump when your system runs out of memory?
No, I'm just a kind of guy(I'm 18) that ask every sh!t. Just curiosity.
In practice the GC runs exactly as I described. System.gc() only suggests for garbage collection to take place. Either you are triggering it via that JVMs implementation or it is just a coincidence. If your code is writing multiple System.gc() to force a trigger that is really bad. 
&gt; If your code is writing multiple System.gc() to force a trigger that is &gt; really bad. Hello? That's what I told the OP. But I've done it in benchmark code on a few occasions, in order to be able to measure memory usage as accurately as possible.
You're asking reddit to do your homework for you? At least post something plausible that you've tried but didn't work.
Trust me, ive done lots already, but this is doing my head in! I cant figure it out, im poor at java. Here is one of the many solutions I tried: import java.util.Scanner; public class Q14 { int Num; System.out.println("Enter a number: "); public Num() { } public String Integer(int Integer) { if(Num &lt; 3) { return "You didnt enter 3"; } else if(Num &gt; 3) { return "You didnt enter 3"; } else if(Num = 3) { return "You entered 3"; } } }
Can you specify what you mean by "basic java"? Seems i have to update my definition. [First step](http://tinyurl.com/4yhtauz), then you need [this](http://tinyurl.com/3qxkxry). Put this together in the main method and basically you are done. 
It's also worth noting that if your app is running out of memory, you might consider various memory optimization techniques for low-memory devices. I don't know what type of app you're writing but these could include compression, consolidation, and procedural generation. I'm not a J2ME dev (I do ESB-based distributed enterprise systems) but I'm sure there's a lot of helpful techniques available online. My recommendation would be to find a J2ME-focused community that has a Symbian-specific subforum.
Is this what they're teaching in schools these days? * You need a main ~~class~~ method * You cannot use *Integer* as a method because it is already an established object in the core java library Google should be more informative, but to start, a standard template class looks like the following: import java.util.Scanner; public class Derp { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println("Derp a derp: "); //look up the readLine stuff on google and pasty your if-else logic here. } } 
As a further note: *all* programs in Java start at a "main" method with the arguments "String[] args". You always need this.
A couple things: * You don't want anything other than variable declarations outside of functions. The compiler won't really know when to call System.out, or it'll call it at a weird time. * Your constructor is named differently from the actual class. I have no idea what that'll actually do, but I'm surprised BlueJ didn't give you errors about it. * It won't make a difference in how the code runs, but start variable names with a lower case letter. So 'num' instead of 'Num' or 'fromConsole' instead of 'FromConsole'. There's no real reason other than that's how everyone names variables, and it messes with peoples head otherwise. * I'm assuming "Num = 3" is a typo, but single equals sets a variable (so you are defining Num to be 3) and double equals is a comparison. * You can call System.console() to get a console object, and then call console.readLine() to read from the console. It will return a string though, so either call [Integer.parseInt()](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html) or compare Num against "3" instead of 3. http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/Console.html * To save some typing in the future, you can redo the if statements to if (Num !=3){return "not 3";} else if (Num == 3) {return "entered 3";} Don't get too upset if you keep struggling with Java. I'm assuming this is your first programming language, and learning how to program is hard. But then one day a few months from now a switch will throw in your brain and all the sudden you'll understand. 
if(input &lt; 3) { return "You didnt enter 3"; } else if(input &gt; 3) { return "You didnt enter 3"; } else ~~(input == 3)~~ { return "You entered 3"; } If you use "if ... else if .... else if" then compiler will point out, that your method do not return a String, since there can be more options witch are not covered. So you need a "else" at the end. To compare primitive data types in java (like int-s), use [operators](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/operators.html): "==" is an operator, "=" is not. This Version do the same: public String isItThree(int input) { if(input != 3) { return "You didnt enter 3"; } return "You entered 3"; } 
BlueJ has some weird GUI on top of standard java, and I don't think you need a main() to run a program. When I worked with BlueJ it was just so we could get used to Java. Simple things like this problem, and then in the next class they gave us eclipse and told us how to actually write a program, with main() and MouseInputAdapter and all that fun. BlueJ is java in the shallow end with water wings on. Also, why can't you use Integer as a method name? I know it's bad practice, but since it's a class name vs. a method name, the namespace should be completely different.
The core Java is already using it as an object. So it's more of the fact that it already exists than bad practice. Also, you can use *int* native data type instead of *Integer* the object.
Remove these lines: int Num; System.out.println("Enter a number: "); public Num() { } Change "public String Integer(int Integer)" to "public void myMethod(int Num)" Change the Num = 3 to Num == 3 (set value vs. check value) Instead of return "blah blah", change the lines to System.out.println("blah blah") When I started out with this stuff 4 years ago I also had trouble with wrapping my head around it all, but one day it all more or less "clicked" and now I'm juggling bits around in my sleep.
Thanks for that, it was very helpful. It compiles fine, but the user is meant to input a integer value, then the system.out.println line is displayed. When I did what you said, the user cannot input anything. Any ideas on how I can input a line so the user can enter in a number?
Then I would make another method (like the myMethod) that * Grabs a number from the keyboard * Sends that number off to your other method Getting input from keyboard is fairly easy: Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); // set up a "scanner" for reading input from keyboard int i = sc.nextInt(); // get a number from the scanner you can then use "i" as a parameter to "myMethod" myMethod(i); You should still be able to input values without all this since you're using BlueJ, but this will let you do it directly from the keyboard.
I was assigned to a project in Java after many years of keeping my distance from it (due to its excessive complexity). I found out that Java EE 6 is a great evolution, much simpler than before and very competitive if compared to modern alternatives like ASP.NET MVC and Django. So I'd recommend you to take a look at what modern Java looks like and I think a good place to start are the tutorials at netbeans.org: http://netbeans.org/kb/trails/java-se.html and http://netbeans.org/kb/trails/java-ee.html
Every single interview I've been in asks how you'd implement a linked list: know how to whiteboard a solution for the get/set/iterate operations. Also know how to guesstimate the complexity of basic algorithms. Know what exceptions are for and the difference between unchecked and checked exceptions. If you haven't gone through the first round of interviews, think of answers to the HR person's questions: describe a time when you were challenged and how you dealt with it, describe how you work with a team, etc.
I got asked [this](http://questionsininterview.com/welcome-to-questionsininterview-com/problem-solving-interview-questions/equal-halves-of-rectangular-birthday-cake-interview-question/) a couple of times. And also the ones about sorting Al Gore Rhythms.
You either know it or you don't. A few days out there's not much you can do other than rehearse some syntax and study the Java Collections. Do you know any EE java? Spring framework or any other IOCs. Do you know the java annotation framework? What's new in java 6 and 7?
which kind of entry level position is this, entry level like "no background experience" or entry level like "4 year working experience"
Understand the concepts of OOP, and you should be fine. Polymorphism, Inheritance, abstraction, etc.... 
As an entry level position, we know you have very little technical skills. The main things I focus on are problem solving skills and how you fit into the culture. Anything you put on your resume is fair game for an interviewer to drill you on, so make sure that 20 minutes of looking at w3schools does not make you fluent in {insert language here}.
Make sure you're on top of generics and java collections. Also practice describing a complex system that you've worked on or studied using diagrams on a whiteboard. I always give extra credit for being able to explain a complex system to a group. Also, if you've got a framework like Spring under you belt it counts for a lot. If that's not possible then at least study the pros and cons of the popular ones like Spring and Struts. Don't be afraid of getting stuck during the technical tests, just keep your cool and explain what you do know and what's blocking you. The interviewer will be looking for what he/she can give you credit for, not just for where the gaps in your knowledge are.
I'd respectfully disagree. I recommend studying hard between now and the interview. You'll kick yourself if you don't put in the work and put in a poor show.
This is for Java ME, not Android. Pretty much nobody uses ME anymore. ;)
Here are some Java-specific questions I've been asked in interviews... * What methods are on the Object class? * If you define an equals() method on a class, what other method should you also define? * What are two ways to use the Thread class to create a separate running process? Explain the public, private, and protected modifiers on a method or field. What is the scope if you don't specify any? * What does the "transient" modifier on a field mean? * What is a Java VM? * What is inheritance? * What is data hiding? * What is polymorphism? * What are some issues involved with multi-threading?
i don't even ...
Meaning the entry for the BT SIG applies only for JavaME? Who does the *they* in "they misinterpreted" refer to?
The HR lady I spoke to said, "a little beyond entry-level"...so I guess some experience.
All of these are good... obviously it depends on the job, I work with java but its not j2ee so frameworks and stuff have little meaning... what most people usually want to know is do you know OOP concepts and can you effectively problem solve... syntax of a language can always be learned or taught.
Well I am not sure in Java but if you are using Windows already, just use robocopy?
How about using getSubimage(int x, int y, int w, int h) (Returns a subimage defined by a specified rectangular region.)
Upvote for Thinking in Java, great book! Your next step should be to take a look at patterns in java (Imho more important than algorithms at the beginning). One of the famoust lectures ist Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by "Gang of Four". I'm not sure if there is a free copy of this book, but there is a loot of free material about this topic: http://www.javacamp.org/designPattern/index.html Patterns are widely used (not only in java-world) and it helps when you know them. 
Long story short: Java doesn't have a very good way of copying files except in in Java 7 which *just* came out. In java 7 use java.nio.file.Files. There are a couple methods on there for copying files. before java 7 you need to use some kind of loop to copy the bytes one at a time. Personally, I think java might be too heavy duty for simply IT stuff. You may be better off studying Python.
Sure, you could do it in Java, though it's not really the best language for this particular task. I suggest learning Python; it's a great scripting language that will make your life easier for these sorts of tasks (and it scales up to more hearty tasks and applications). Your concerns for this task: * Java can handle nested folders; you don't need to be concerned about folder depth (it's unlikely you'll have so many folders that you overflow the stack). * Java can handle UNC paths just fine. You can use them with regular File objects. * You can catch IOExceptions and save them to a file or output them to the console.
Robocopy is your best option. I have written a Java program for my son who works on servers to do some of these tasks. The program outputs a robocopy script. The same could easily be done in any other programming language.
Robocopy for your copying needs. Powershell for everything else. Java can work, but since you're already working in Windows, use the tools MS has provided.
Python is a nice language, but if you're in an all-Windows shop, Powershell is the way to go.
I guess I should further explain problem #1. I have a start screen. I get there no problem. If I have the aforementioned line of code, when I click on the "start game" button, the game become unresponsive. It stops repainting. Like if you move something in front of where the applet was, you will only see artifacts of whatever you moved over it. Like I said, this only happens with that one line of code. If i remove it completely, then the image just isn't there, but everything else functions properly. If I replace that line of code with a fillRect() method, I can draw rectangles to represent the sprite. No, the sprite isn't used anywhere else, so, it might be doing something funky... but, problem #2 kinda prevents me from checking into that.
Are you sure the image has been loaded successfully?
Pass something as the [ImageObserver](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/awt/image/ImageObserver.html) and see if you get any useful information from there. Sorry I am not sure how to debug this in Firefox though. 
Can you post the text file you are using? 
CODE, we need code!
What do you mean "stops recognizing lines"? Perhaps you have different kinds of line-ending characters in the file? "\r", "\n", or "\r\n"?
Pausing often relates to GC cycles, so see if that could be an issue first. How many total files are you reading? Does this happen every N files (maybe a resource leak happens and GC kicks in to free it up)? Anything else running on computer that does file access? My first guess is that GC is kicking in, what parameters are you using when you execute your program (-XmX - Xms)? What version of java? To check GC, after you start it, attach [http://java.sun.com/performance/jvmstat/visualgc.html](visualgc) or netbeans IDE and watch the memory usage, handle usage, etc. 
The start screen has 3 images. Each of them load. This image is in the same location. I also surrounded the above line with an if statement: if (spriteSheet != null) In other words, don't attempt to draw if the image doesn't exist. It still goes unresponsive. The only way I found to stop this is to comment out the entire drawImage call. I'm I doing this right? Are there other ways I can go about troubleshooting this?
As I said, just a simple while loop. I even stripped everything else out and it still happened. This code produces the error: Scanner s = new Scanner(new File("filename.html"));//I know the file name isn't a problem while (s.hasNextLine()) { String line = s.nextLine(); System.out.println(line); }
Go to http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c/lesson1.html , and use your browser to save the html file. That's what I'm using. There is only one place at which the text I noted appears. This happens with other pages within the same tutorial as well.
I've had a lot of experiences with robocopy and I've had issues with error handling. Maybe it's just my ignorance of batch/cmd. 
By "stops recognizing lines", I mean that the Scanner simply seems to think it is done. However, there are definitely still lines left (quite a few, in fact)
&gt; I tried the loop in Eclipse and it works. Tried running it from the command line?
Try this: Scanner s = new Scanner(new File("filename.html"),"iso-8859-1");
