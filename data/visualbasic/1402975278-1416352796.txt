That'll work. You might want to add Q or quit or exit as a choice to get out of the loop easily. 
I got it senpai - totalSales = computeTotal ( unitPrice , quantity) - taxAmount = computeTax (totalSales, state) 
That's right! Now try to code the insides of computeTotal and computeTax.
how would i do that?
Yeah, that's... not quite it. You need the insides for it to work. That's just the header for the function. On the up side, the header's correct!
ElseIf state = Q then 'Let user know that he exited or maybe even go back to start EndIf
When I attempt to load the Images from the list to the picture box I get this error: An error occurred creating the form. See Exception.InnerException for details. The error is: Unable to cast object of type 'System.Collections.Generic.List`1[System.Drawing.Image]' to type 'System.Drawing.Image'. my coding for the image list looks like this: **Private PicList1 As New List(Of Image) From {My.Resources.A1, My.Resources.A3, My.Resources.A2}** I'm attempting to load the list like this (I don't think this is right): **PictureBox1.Image = PicList1** Is this the command to load a list of images in to this box...What else am I missing? Any help would be appreciated! Thank you! 
Any luck with the insides? Here's a code snippet for computeTax: Public Function computeTax(totalSalesPrice as Double, state as String) as Double Dim taxRate as Double = 0 If state = "FL" then taxRate = 0.06 ElseIf state = ... Return totalSalesPrice * taxRate End Function
define "puts it into a text box". vbs doesn't have a gui, so it doens't have a text box. closest you get with vba is an HTA, which is basically html, which get rendered a special styled IE window. to put it in a browser proper you'd have to write out an html file and load it.
Tried that, but then it won't allow a capital letter. Trying to format it so that the user can input both Monday and monday and receive the same reply
I have no idea what you mean. I do this all the time.
haha sorry, I'm very new at this. Would you mind quickly editing my code so that it includes what you said? 
or, show what you did that didn't work
You probably didn't. Select case lcase(day) Case "monday" ... Case "friday" ... End select All the cases should be in lowercase with the select having an lcase wrapped around day. Thus it is case-insensitive
got it! thank you, I wasn't sure where to put the LCase(Day). Thanks again!
I am a noob looking to learn visual basic to streamline my word processing. WHere shoudl I start?
What kind of word processing streamlining are you looking at?
One possibility is to simply code everything in VB, then output it as a HTML document with a JS script that automatically refreshes the page every few seconds. I don't think it's the best solution, but it's a possible solution.
A log of every calculation completed?
user programmable function buttons? 
Make a notepad style calculator, where you just enter text and clcik the = button, and the calculator prints out the answer. 2 +2 --- 4
I have always wanted a calculator that has 2 columns the one on the left is decimal and the one on the right is Hex. It runs like a regular calculator but you can either enter hex or decimal. 
Days and dates: Days between two dates, What date is a date plus x days, What day of the week is a given date. You'll get points for those.
I appreciate the fact that you tried the code yourself first! I know it's late, but I would honestly reconsider the way you set up your data structures. It's a bit weird and clunky to store the information in Listboxes and such. Instead, why not create them as objects and store them as such? Public Class seat Public Property row as Integer Public Property col as Char Public Property passengerName as String Public ReadOnly Property isOccupied as Boolean Get If passengerName = "" Then Return False Else Return True End Get End Property Public Sub New(_row as Integer, _col as Char) row = _row col = _col End Sub End Class Now you have a class of objects named "seat" with three properties: row, col and passengerName. You also have a special readonly property, isOccupied, that automatically checks if the seat is filled by looking at the passengerName field: if it's empty, it'll return false (because it's not occupied), but otherwise it'll return true (i.e. it's occupied). Now we need to initialise the objects. Dim airplane as New List(of seat) For row = 1 to 10 For col = "A" to "D" 'I don't know if this works, it's worth a shot; if not just run the ASC(x) - 65 trick Dim seat as New Seat(row, col) airplane.Add(seat) Next Next Tadah! Now you have an airplane that's full of empty seats, and you're ready to start assigning seats to people. So let's say the user enters the following information into his textboxes: &gt;passengerName = phrox Row = 5 Col = C I'm going to write first a generic search function that will retrieve the seat I want when I enter the row and col into it. Public Function getSeat(_row as Integer, _col as Char) as seat For Each seat in airplane If seat.row = _row AndAlso seat.col = _col then Return seat Next Return Nothing End Function And I'm going to use that function to fetch me the seat the user enters. Assuming the input is stored in passengerName, row and col accordingly: Dim currentSeat as seat = getSeat(row, col) If currentSeat.isOccupied = True Then Msgbox("Sorry, the current seat is occupied!") Else 'seat is empty, add passenger to the seat currentSeat.passengerName = passengerName End If I can also write a generic function to check if the plane is full: Public Function isPlaneFull() as Boolean Dim hasEmptySeat as Boolean = False For Each seat in airplane If seat.isOccupied = False then hasEmptySeat = True Next If hasEmptySeat = False then return True else return false End Function So if you want to automatically check if the plane is full when the user enters an occupied seat, you can modify the code above slightly to reflect that: Dim currentSeat as seat = getSeat(row, col) If currentSeat.isOccupied = True Then If isPlaneFull = True then 'plane is full, add passenger to waiting list Msgbox("Sorry, the whole plane is full! You'll be added to a waiting list.") waitingList.add(passengerName) Else 'only seat is full Msgbox("Sorry, the current seat is occupied!") End If Else 'seat is empty, add passenger to the seat currentSeat.passengerName = passengerName End If 
Here's how the code would look in its entirety: http://pastebin.com/1g9nxJnY
Thank you SO much, I'm going to work it all into my code and hopefully it turns out, i'll leave a reply soon anyways!
Generic lists don't fire events. If you were to make your own class, and shadow the add event, you could wire up your own event. Just remember you would also likely need to wire up other events if you wanted notification, like AddRange, remove, etc.. Here is a real quick example of what I am talking about, done in WinForms Public Class Form1 Dim WithEvents myList As New SuperList(Of String) Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load myList.Add("Hello World") End Sub Private Sub myList_ItemAdded(sender As Object, e As ItemAddedEventArgs(Of String)) Handles myList.ItemAdded MessageBox.Show(e.ItemAdded &amp; " was added") End Sub End Class Public Class SuperList(Of T) Inherits List(Of T) Public Event ItemAdded(sender As Object, e As ItemAddedEventArgs(Of T)) Public Shadows Sub Add(Item As T) MyBase.Add(Item) RaiseEvent ItemAdded(Me, New ItemAddedEventArgs(Of T) With {.ItemAdded = Item}) End Sub End Class Public Class ItemAddedEventArgs(Of T) Inherits EventArgs Property ItemAdded As T End Class *EDIT, not sure why the auto VB formatting is screwing up, but you should be able to copy/paste the code.. just make sure you get all of it
Thanks! This is exactly what I was looking for. EDIT: is there no way for the event to fire _before_ it is added? That is to say, when I call myList.Add(x), let me run some code through x first before actually adding it to myList?
Seems like an [ObservableCollection(Of T)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms668604%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) would be the perfect thing to use.
Holy text wall. I think you may get better responses if you format the thing a bit first, dude.
If that were the desired order of things, why wouldn't you just call the code on x that you want, then add it to the list? Why does it require an event?
I want to run some code every single time something gets added to the list (eg make sure it's not a duplicate etc). Anyway I got around it by creating a custom class to hold the list, expose an add function, doing whatever needs to be done, before adding it to the list proper. Thanks! :)

it might be possible in vba in excel, but it's not going to be easy. you'd need to have some sort of placeholder overlays or maybe macro buttons, and I've no idea how moving and zooming would work to achieve that effect 
I thought it would be overly complicated - especially for someone at my skill level. So, I want to visualize the computation of a formula for the user by breaking down each variable into its necessary inputs. I want to have a broad, top-down cover page where the user can click on a piece of the formula and have it take them to the place where inputs are needed. I was hoping for a flashy Prezi type of zoom but, if that's too difficult, do you have any ideas for something a little more substantial than just hyperlinking an object to a cell on a different sheet? Or am I stuck with that? Thanks for your help.
I can't think of any other way without making a full blown application.
Have you tried using the record macro then imitating the zoom/effects you want? I just played around with it to see what kind of code the vb editor would spit back, and found something like ActiveWindow.SmallScroll Down:=-33 Range("Z16").Select ActiveWindow.SmallScroll Down:=-15 ActiveWindow.Zoom = 110 ActiveWindow.Zoom = 120 Honestly I would make your formula in different shapes or text boxes, and then set each macro to work on-click of that text box. If you're jumping sheets you will need to either activate or specify the sheet that has the range you want to look at.
By left do you mean that the textbox loses focus, or that the text box is the only one left standing after the rest has been deleted? The former can be triggered with the textbox.lostFocus or textbox.Leave events, while the latter can be done by iterating through all remaining controls on the form and, if it's the only one remaining, do X. 
What you want to do is to download the program without user interaction, and save it to the another folder, or with a different name. Then you can rename the exe for the running program, and then rename the new one to the correct name. The next time they run the program it will run the correct one, or you can prompt them to restart. The trick with this is that you can rename the current running EXE, but you can't delete it. Here's a snipped of code from my own update system that replaces itself as part of the update: If IO.File.Exists(My.Application.Info.DirectoryPath &amp; "\oldupdate.exe") Then IO.File.Delete(My.Application.Info.DirectoryPath &amp; "\oldupdate.exe") 'delete old old backup from the last update End If If IO.File.Exists(UpdateFolder &amp; "\update.exe") Then 'if we have a never version of the updater IO.File.Move(My.Application.Info.DirectoryPath &amp; "\update.exe", My.Application.Info.DirectoryPath &amp; "\oldupdate.exe") 'rename existing version via Move IO.File.Move(UpdateFolder &amp; "\update.exe", My.Application.Info.DirectoryPath &amp; "\update.exe") 'move new version in End If edit: accidentally pasted code twice ...
The name doesn't matter. When creating your textbox, add it to a list (of textbox). In the sub that handles the lostFocus event, add "handles textbox.lostfocus" to the end of the sub. I can't remember the exact syntax for the handling, but if nobody replies to you in about 12 hours, I'll go back, check it out and reply to you with the exact code necessary.
I'm not sure if this is helpful (probably not, if your users are having problems with downloading a file), but if you're using any kind of source version control like Github or Subversion, you should be able to roll out patches almost seamlessly. Your users can submit a pull request from the main branch, and the exe should be updated automatically.
Neat idea, but so much duplication... Dim oldUpdateExe = Path.Combine(My.Application.Info.DirectoryPath &amp; "\oldupdate.exe") If File.Exists(oldUpdateExe) Then File.Delete(oldUpdateExe) ' delete old old backup from the last update End If Dim updateSource = Path.Combine(UpdateFolder &amp; "\update.exe") Dim updateExe = Path.Combine(My.Application.Info.DirectoryPath &amp; "\update.exe") If File.Exists(updateSource) Then ' if we have a never version of the updater File.Move(updateExe, oldUpdateExe) ' rename existing version via Move File.Move(updateSource, updateExe) ' move new version in End If
Yea, I should have cleaned it up a bit more before posting. ... It makes much more sense in the original code where there are three different folders involved, additional code to move the original file to a backup folder, and it's being repeated for several more files .... 
use belarc advisor. It creates the html pages for you automatically with a list of all software keys.
thanks, but that is not actually helpful, but that is my fault because I haven't made myself clear. They need to see who is using which license at what time. That is simple, by using a license manager. I have already made the code to output the file from the license manager. I have no clue of how to make this work through an Intranet. Thank you nonetheless 
Like you needed to code a simple dirty web server?
Yeah, i am currently going through these walkthroughs http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/4b0136/getting-started-with-intranet-application-in-mvc-4/ http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/aa964620%28v=vs.100%29.aspx which is very tricky since one is outdated and the second one is not so helpful concerning the intranet. It's been going ok so far, however I am very nervous about screwing anything up by working on the intranet. I am also confused about how I could make it possible for people from the office to access the site without a password and the site to be unavailable out of the office.
Let me preface this by saying that I haven't worked in VBA in many, many years, so I could be off a bit here ... The second comboBox should be filled on the selectedIndexChanged event (or whatever event you are using) from the first one, and then the third should be filled on the event from the second one ....... So you should be able to replicate whatever code you are using on the first combo (to fill the second) into the same event on the second to fill the third. 
If it helps, I have 3 options for box 1 A B C Theres 2 options for each A1 A2 B1 B2 C1 C2 then each have 3 options A1a A1b A1c B1a B1b B1c C1a C1b C1c Can someone help me so that I can make it ONLY display the options for its second option? 
Sorry I'm explaining it wrong. Some of the second options share the same name and have different 3rd options, I don't want to do it from that method because it would display an option that doesn't fit with option one. I'm hoping to find a sort of If 1 is blah and 2 is blah then display this set, if 1 is blah blah and 2 is blah then display this other set. Sorry for any confusion it's been a long week.
I'm also having a similar problem. I can't offer any help, but do you mind telling me what tutorials (if any) you used to start learning how to use visual basic with the content controls?
[Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4Dyp_u-Zo4)
Not really sure without knowing where it's failing at, but you aren't specifying a full path for UpdateFolder, and you aren't adding a filename to the UpdateSource variable when you call "CombinePath". You should be able to evaluate each part of the system with breakpoints and see what is happening (are the files downloaded, are they then where you expect them to be, etc.). One thing to keep in mind, you may need admin privileges to move a file into "\Program Files" if that's where your app lives. 
Process.start is what you are looking for. You can specify the name of the application.. If your app is single instance, then you'll need to use a second app to restart the first. 
The basic idea is make text boxes. tbName,tbDate... To see what someone entered Dim sName string SName =tbName.text And so on
as far as VB is concerned, html is just text. parse it using "screen scraping" techniques. there's probably some html parsing libraries, or if it's well formed enough you might be able to use an xml library to parse it. I don't have any specific recommendations though. however, you'll be better off arranging API access via soap or something. 
The majority of my code comes from threads I find on here, Googling helps find a bunch of it but this problem has been something I havent been able to get past. http://www.ozgrid.com/
Is that VB6? dim v as integer ' Read the current value v = Val(WebBrowser1.Document.GetElementById("question").GetAttribute("value")) ' Increment it v = v + 1 ' Write it back WebBrowser1.Document.GetElementById("question").SetAttribute("value", v)
So you're writing a bot and you need to circumvent the anti-bot measures? Naughty. Naughty. Interestingly, the "1574bddb75c78a6fd2251d61e2993b5146201319" is the SHA-1 hash of the answer "16"... You can't reverse the hash, but if the answer is always a number, it's pretty easy to make a lookup table and give the correct answer. Since it's a simple check for humans, the range is probably something like 0 to 100.
Thanks! worked perfect
Thanks for the info! :) The range is actually 1-20 haha
The parenthesis after string making it into an array makes a lot of sense; thanks for helping me learn something new!! ~~When I try to run the program, the line "smallAnimal(animal)" comes up as "Conversion from string "Arctic fox" to type 'Integer' is not valid." (Arctic Fox is the first animal in the array that starts with letter A, which I used to test.)~~ ~~This is actually an issue I saw before. I don't think I'm using reDim preserve correctly. Is that the issue?~~ Thanks! EDIT: In a stroke of luck and maybe a bit of understanding, I got it working! Thanks so much for your help; it really got me out of that rut!
A few oddities: strLetter = CStr(txtLetter.Text) Cstr isn't needed since the .Text function already returns a string. No conversion needed. findAnimals(strLetter) You have a function to find the animals by a certain letter and then save those matching into a global variable, an array. Then you return this array but do nothing with it. To illustrate, it should be something like: Dim animalsSubset() as Array animalsSubset = findAnimals(strLetter) Then lstAnimal.Items.AddRange(animalsSubset) You can condense it further by doing it all on one line: lstAnimal.Items.AddRange(findAnimals(strLetter)) Thus no need to create a one time variable - less typing if nothing else. Another issue is your use of global variables. Good practise means we should minimise the use of global variables because in reality, you quickly lose track of which variable is used where and the need to keep unique names becomes difficult. Memory use can also grow unchecked as no variables are freed up - they exist for as long as the program runs. But anyway, here is my code: I've left a few things in so you can see what I did, but we could trim this down further...:) 'Define variables Dim strAnimal() As String = IO.File.ReadAllLines("SwedenAnimals.txt") 'Run function, add to listbox Private Sub btnAnimal_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnAnimal.Click lstAnimal.Items.AddRange(findAnimals(txtLetter.Text.Substring(0, 1))) 'Added a substring in case the user types more than one letter - users are dumb. Rule #1 :) End Sub 'Populate array "smallAnimal" Function findAnimals(ByVal strLetter As String) As String() Dim animalQuery1 As IEnumerable(Of String)= From animal As String In strAnimal Where animal.Substring(0, 1) = strLetter Select animal Dim smallAnimal() As String smallAnimal = animalQuery1.ToArray() 'The query function you're using is handy, but as with many such collection objects, it has a function to generate an array equivalent automatically. Also, I've defined animalQuery1 properly - VB can work out what you mean in most cases, but it's best to be explicit. Return smallAnimal End Function 
It sounds like maybe you didn't create the correct type of project when you started. You should have created an office addin for outlook. When you select new project in VS, there should be an "office" node, which will have Outlook 20xx add-in" (xx depending on what versions of office and VS you happen to be working with). When you make one of these add-ins, the ribbon stuff is all wired up and available directly for you to use. It is actually really easy. Don't worry too much about the form you already created, you don't need to throw it out. These addins are capable of using standard windows forms. You can just add the exiting .vb form file to this new project once you have created it.
Hi, thanks for the quick reply. I have in fact created the right project. My problem is with the actual code. I'm currently on my mobile so I am unable to send the code I have. Are these buttons added with code or does outlook automatically know when I've created a new form and add the button in one of the menus?
OK. So you have an outlook add-in project. Right click on the project in the solution explorer, and select add -&gt; new item. When the add dialog comes up, you should find "Ribbon (Visual Designer)" as an item you can pick. This will give you the ribbon control for you to place your buttons on, similar to the way you would place buttons on a form in Visual Studio. Hopefully that gets you where you need to be. If not, let me know where you are stuck. 
Thank you very much! It's Canada day right now so folks want me to quit being anti social... kind of hard to do when you're thinking about a problem like this.. I'm sure you know the feeling. I'll post back in the evening. Cheers
PDF files are tricky, since there are lots of different tools that create them, a number of versions, and lots of differences from file to file. Both bits of code you have are opening the PDF file as a giant string of data, and then just parsing the raw text looking for the "/Type/Pages" and then "/Count" field. The accuracy of these is going to vary based on a number of things ... How the file was created, how it's laid out, etc. For instance: In looking at a few PDF files I have here, Some have "/Type/Pages", others have "/Type /Pages", and yet another has "/Type" and "/Pages" on two separate lines ..... Most of those have "/Count" on a separate line below the "/Type/Pages" section, but another has all three on the same line. So you can see that parsing on that bit of text can be very tricky, and each version of the code you posted fails a bit differently. In another PDF I have there isn't even a "/Count" field in the file (it has 36 pages), so it would return 0 pages using either of those methods. Another possible way to do this is to look for the "/Type/Page" (not Pages) element and count them. But even this has it's problems; The 36 page PDF with no /Count field has 69 of those in it. The /Count field has another weakness; if the file is created by a PDF tool that allows merging, or adding more pages (many PDF creators added as printers), it may not correct the page count of the original PDF, but just merge the new one at the bottom. This could give you two different page counts, or just one bad one, but neither will be correct. 
Wow that's an amazingly detailed answer! Thanks very much, certainly not straightforward to achieve. How would you implement the alternative RegEx in your reply? I tried replacing RegExp.Pattern = "/Type\s*/Page[^s]" with RegExp.Pattern = "/Type /Pages\nCount ([0-9]+)" but that just gives me zero for every file. Apologies, the whole RegEx thing is very very new to me so not really got my head around it yet...
Sorry, should have been more specific. The second RegEx would be to try against files that return 0 with the first one, but replacing the .Pattern is exactly how you implement it. Like I said, your best bet is to run the first two methods, and then open the PDF with a text editor to see what the file actually contains. If the code is returning what the file contains, then that's as good as it gets with either of those methods. 
Putting a macro on the quick access toolbar in Excel 2007. Click the excel logo and then Excel Options at the bottom. Click Customize then change Popular Commands to Macros. Find your Macro in the list and Add it to the Quick Access toolbar. Then click modify to change the name or thumbnail image.
I have excel2013 and was hoping to activate it from a userform. 
From the VBE window, select the userform. Double click the button on the userform that you want the macro to start from. Then enter the call into the sub that is created from the code view. Call module1.Macroname
Thanks for clarifying :) Seems like the client's desire (for accurate page counts - has to be near 100% accurate for legal purposes) is going to be nigh-on impossible to achieve then, as PDFs are so variable. Oh well, not a lot that can be done there! Thanks for taking the time to discuss and explain all that to me sir, much appreciated!
No problem .... If the client really wants a very accurate count then a third party component that loads the PDF may be your best bet. Most should be able to provide an accurate count based on actual pages in the file. Alternatively, you could probably build a better parser yourself, but you'd probably have to read up on the PDF spec to figure out the various versions and layouts involved. http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html

Couldn't agree more with this ... I'd go so far as to say that if you need to change the size of the array (via Redim Preserve), then you should dump the array and use a List. 
when working with word, im trying to place VB labels into my actual document. is there a way to keep that label in line with the actual text line? currently it jumps up by about a quarter of a space each time. so it s something like " xxxxxx ^xxxxx xxx " when its its displayed. the middle set of XXXX's is what im trying to lower. resizing the height of the label fixes the issue- but if i want to use auto sizing for that label, it will go back to the previous width upon being updated by my VB macro.... any pointers on how to stop this? 
Right click on your project in the Solution Explorer, select Add, and then select Existing item.
form.show()?
Why not take a page from online games? The game you launch is actually a launcher. The launcher is responsible for making sure all of the program files are up to date, etc. If one (or more) needs updating, you just download it. Since the program is not running, you shouldn't have issues with overwriting. Note: I just skimmed the previous replies so if anyone already suggested this, great minds think alike :)
I wish it were that simple but that is not an option, should I show you the code I have so far? edit: the form was created within visual studio, how exactly do I reference is when writing form.show()? edit: here's the line Dim form As FormRegion(newreuqest) newrequest is underlined and says 'Array bounds cannot appear in type specifiers'.
Form.show is the standard method to show a form that is currently not showing. All you should need to do is in your button code, put form.show(), and replace form with the actual name of your form.
What is the reference to the actual form? I'm trying to reference it when creating my variable for the form.show() part of the code, but I don't know where I am supposed to reference the form if I have created it in visual studio.
by project do you mean solution? they are in the same solution but the button is on a ribbon and the form is, well, a form. Is there a way I can post my code to allow more troubleshooting? edit: reference to a non-shared member requires an object reference is the error I get when trying the code above :/

I've read up quite a bit since then, I believe it has something to do with event handlers. I believe i need to raise my events in each individual form and ribbon, and then have my main addin receive those events and handle them accordingly. 
It possible it is a quirk on how Outlook handles addins. With straight up VB (I'm using VS 2012 Premium), I create a project with two forms (form1 and form3). I put a button on form1 called Button1. In the Button1_Click event (the default stub generated when you double-click the button in the designer), I add the following code: Form3.Show() When I run the code, Form1 with the button appears. I click the button, and form3 appears.
I am willing to help but I won't outright create this for you. This forum is for people who want to learn and improve their code. 
Hoping someone answers this soon, but what is the difference between these two types of array declarations: Dim accounts As Object() and Dim accounts() As Object
This isn't an OS, nor a "Sub-OS" or a "Fake OS" This isn't even a desktop environment. It's just a window with a few other windows.
What is ppLayoutBlank? I don't see that being instantiated anywhere in the code you have. EDIT: If you're referencing the ppLayoutBlank from the enum, you could use Microsoft.Office.Interop.PowerPoint.PpSlideLayout.ppLayoutBlank to fully qualify it. I often have to do this for office interop if I copy and paste code from an excel macro into a VB application. Depending on your imports you could get away with as little as PpSlideLayout.ppLayoutBlank or anything in between. Maybe it helps.
There is one glaring difference between your attempt and the original author: The original author was using version 9.0 of the PowerPoint object library and both you and I are using version 14. I typically use the Interop Assemblies as opposed to going straight to adding COM references. I've found the interop assemblies a little easier to work with, and their supposed to be easier come distribution time. All that being said, here is what appears to be working: Imports Microsoft.Office.Core Imports Microsoft.Office.Interop Module Module1 Sub Main() 'declare object variables' Dim pptApp As PowerPoint.Application Dim pptFile As PowerPoint.Presentation Dim pptShape As PowerPoint.Shape Dim pptSlide As PowerPoint.Slide 'start ppt application and make it visible' pptApp = CreateObject("PowerPoint.Application") pptApp.Visible = MsoTriState.msoTrue 'add new presentation and save it' pptFile = pptApp.Presentations.Add(MsoTriState.msoTrue) pptFile.SaveAs("C:\Stuff\mypres.ppt") 'add a new slide pptSlide = pptFile.Slides.AddSlide(1, pptFile.SlideMaster.CustomLayouts.Item(7)) End Sub End Module The pptFile.SlideMaster.CustomLayouts.Item(7) line is the fix here. The magic numeral 7 took some time to get to. I ended up iterating over the whole collection. There was 11 of them. From what I can gather, all of these are the default power point layout types. Each one has a name. Here's what they were on my side and they probably match yours: 1. Title Slide 1. Title and Content 1. Section Header 1. Two Content 1. Comparison 1. Title Only 1. Blank 1. Content with Caption 1. Picture with Caption 1. Title and vertical text 1. Vertical title and text I looked for an enum inside the library that would correlate to these to make it a little easier, but I couldn't find anything. The PpSlideLayout enum I mentioned before doesn't correlate to this list at all. From what I can gather, this is remnants of an old feature. Edit: Got my indents all wrong and it looked messy.
Au contraire. This is in ALPHA. Nothing looks like anything in ALPHA. I have the third build somewhere else. 
Normally I go with the For Loops route. Can you post the code that you have tried? 
 Private Sub Button7_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button7.Click Label6.Text = "Your external IP is: " &amp; GetIP() End Sub ---- Private Sub Button7_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button7.Click dim newIP as string = GetIP() If newIP &lt;&gt; textbox6.text then Label6.Text = "Your external IP is: " &amp; GetIP() End If End Sub I think that is what you want.
Edited for code.
Thanks for posting code! Your first attempt was pretty close, you just need to add your dynamically created controls to the form. Also, if you started your i at 1, you would have ended up with one extra box. Try something like this: Dim newBox as TextBox Dim numOfBoxes As Integer = Convert.ToInt32(lstattendees.SelectedValue) Dim i, Ypos as integer = 0 For i = 0 To numOfBoxes newBox = new TextBox newBox.Location = new Point(0, Ypos) Me.Controls.Add(newBox) Ypos += 25 Next You will also need to position your new textboxes. I used an arbitrary 0, 0 starting point and increased my Y by 25 each time. You'll have to test and see what works for your form. EDIT: Also, with dynamically created controls, remember to properly dispose of them afterwards otherwise you may eventually run into memory issues.
When you say "script" ... what tool / language are you using to write this?? Is it VB.NET, VB6, VB Script, VBA in a MS Office product? The answer to this will allow a better answer to how to get the path to the Special Folders. 
VB6 - basically its an aid. end user fills out the form, hits a button and it generates a save file with the data plugged into specific parts, and creates 1-3 variations of that based on the choices they made. i need to know if there is basically a way to pre-set that output file to work unilatterally without the user needing to go through save menus. i've done similar with VBA with creating an autosave function for parsing through large mailmerges and creating individiual docs, but i don think that will work here. i dont really need specific code by the way- i just need to know if there is a function within VB that i dont know of that might luckily do this lol. if there isnt i'll just make it so that it will set the path in stone when a user runs it the first time. 
So how do I reference the name in code, to build a string? emailstring = txtname(i).text See what I mean? Thanks for all your help!
I &lt;3 you. I didn't realize there were some old relics in those instructions, I was getting ready to pull out my hair....clearly I need some more practice with this stuff. Thank you so much!
Since it's VB6, the best way is through the SHGetSpecialFolderLocation API call. .... http://allapi.mentalis.org/apilist/SHGetSpecialFolderLocation.shtml Scroll down to the bottom of the page, and there's a link to an example. I believe that "CSIDL_PERSONAL" should get you the \Documents folder. 
IIRC, every sheet has a name. You can access it that way.
yeah the sheet does have a name, but do you by chance recall what command I use instead of .activesheet?
If you want to build an OS, try Perl, Assemly or C++. It is practically impossible to build a OS with VB.NET
Yeah, syntax is similar to what you suggested. Used it very recently but not at my pc now to check.
yep that did it. thanks for the pointer. i figured there was a command to get my desired result vs building some gigantic convoluted string of code to do the same thing lol. 
How would I implement that into the following? This creates a textbox within the powerpoint slide, sets its location, then pulls text from several cells. pptSlide.Shapes.AddTextbox msoTextOrientationHorizontal, 50, 40, 150, 200 pptSlide.Shapes(1).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = Cells(2,1) &amp; Cells(3,1) 
assuming Cells is Worksheet.Cells, something like: Set pptSlide.Shapes(1).TextFrame.TextRange.Font = Cells(2,1).Font http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff744240(v=office.15).aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff194567(v=office.15).aspx
This is a little hacky, but you could store the value of the item in the textbox .tag and then, to calculate the total: Dim ctrl As Control Dim total as Single = 0 For Each ctrl In me.Controls If (ctrl.GetType() Is GetType(TextBox)) Then Dim txt As TextBox = CType(ctrl, TextBox) total += txt.tag*Val(txt.text) End If LblSubtotal.text = cstr(total) 
Chunk of code missing in your pastebin. There are a bunch of ways to do this. I like updating interface as users modify values, giving them the immediate feedback as they work. Giving feedback is very important in a user interface. On the change event of the textboxes I would update the text boxes that store the subtotal of each item and then call a function that would update the grand total by adding up the 3 subtotals. this means that the user is always given feedback on the change and can visual confirm this is what they want before submitting. I usually caution programmers to also do a final function that takes all the values times their costs and compare it to the value in the total textbox so that you can confirm that there was problems in your other code. I don't know how many times I have found a bug in a function but my final check does not match my initial test. **-Bone**
We would love to help you, why don't you tell us what you have so far and we can give you some support and help you figure it out. I wont help if you just want us to do your homework for you. Show us that you want to learn it and I will bend over backwards to help.
The first one creates a *single* variable container that stores an Object. If you were to add a value to object qualifier you would get an "Arry bounds can not appear in a type specifier" error. The second creates an empty array of Accounts each one being an object. The second is the correct one. I almost never use Objects and try to specify exactly what the Variable type is if i can. Dim Accounts(5) as clsAccount Dim Fields(10) as textbox This brings up initializers. (Sometimes called overloads but not exactly the same thing). Use them as much as you can. Dim accounts as string = "First Account" Creates accounts and assigns it the variable "First Account" Dim Accounts as New Account With {.name = "First Account", .acctNumber = "1234"} Creates a new variable from the class account and assign the variable the values supplied. You can also declare multiple variables in a single instance Dim a, b, c As Single, x, y As Double, i As Integer a, b, and c are all Single; x and y are both Double You can also create multiple dimensions of arrays Dim oneDimension(), twoDimensions(,), threeDimensions(,,) As Byte If the array has more than one dimension, you must include commas between the parentheses to indicate the number of dimensions. Dim twoDimensions(,) As Integer = {{0, 1, 2}, {10, 11, 12}} You can initialize the values of an array by using an array literal. To do this, surround the initialization values with braces ({}). I would also check out the [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wak0wfyt.aspx) artical on arrays Well that went down the rabbit whole quickly, sorry about that but I cant stress how imports knowing how to create arrays correctly. The rest of your code depends on it.
well you can select the label and then use the arrow keys to move it 1 pixel at a time until you are happy with it and then copy paste the pair of labels and textboxes as many times as you need. You can use the datagridview method that I specified in an earlier question to just create columns of labels and controls. I would also suggest that you look into WPF form layout it is much better than winforms and you can actually create cut and paste sets of controls in the XAML.
Get your company to spring for a [Safari Books Online](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/) membership, literally thousands of E-books on just about anything technical and has course material for learning as well. It sounds steep at $400 per year, but having the right book and being able to search the text of the entire library for a problem will save you the time which calculates to lots of money for your boss. By the way usually when I see this they want to teach you programming so that they can get a "Cheap" developer. Once you have the capacity to be useful within your organization as a programmer make sure you hit them up for raises as you learn. Our Junior programmers earn $47 per hour. I pay the cream $96 per hour. Self taught or not you will have a higher value. **-Bone**
Good God, this looks like a basic exercise. DO IT YOURSELF. and learn how to program rather than get the net to do it for you. Your missing the point about learning how to program.
Noted.
In your code where you use .ToString("c"), you're already using a format string for currency, ("c"). You need to modify this to ("C5", en-US) - this specifies the currency mode, precision and which currency symbol. More info here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dwhawy9k%28v=vs.110%29.aspx
The "C5" argument specifies the currency and number of decimal places you want. Change it to "C2" to get 2 decimal places.
yes
A few things. Access uses VBA not vb.net and I have no idea how you would call a web script inside of it without jumping through a lot of hoops. Next smsenabler is specifically designed to receive sms, the send text is only as a reply to a received message. Tell your boss you need a diffrent tool and I would advice using vb.net and attaching to the access database from there instead of access.
You'll need to store the number of cappucinos ordered so far as a form-level variable. Basically, between Public Class Form1 and the first sub you have, declare your variable using the Dim command. It is now accessible by any control within this form! Whenever the order button is pressed, increase that variable by a number equal to the value put into the textbox, and then update lblCappaTally to reflect that real number. The code may look something like this: Dim cappaTally as Integer = 0 .... Public Sub orderClick() Handles btnOrder.Click .... cappaTally += quantity lblCappaTally.text = cappaTally End Sub Alternatively, if you're sure that the text in lblCappaTally is always going to be just a number, you can do away with the form-level variable and just do Public Sub OrderButton_Click() Handles OrderButton.Click .... Dim cappaTally as Integer = CInt(lblCappaTally.Text) lblCappaTally.text = cappaTally + quantity End Sub 
Oh, sorry, I misread and thought you had the quantity variable declared in OrderButton_Click when it was actually declared in SubItem. Just throw this above the code you have, immediately after the OrderButton_Click line: Dim quantity As Single = 0 If Not String.IsNullOrEmpty(txt.Text) Then quantity = CSng(txt.Text) End If
OK I see why. Sigh. Look at this bit: SubItem(ByVal txt As TextBox, ByRef lbl As Label) What's the textbox argument being fed into SubItem? Replace txt with the name of the textbox.
As I mentioned in the original post, you have to be sure that lblCappaTally will only hold numbers. Is it currently holding a "-"? That's most likely the cause of your problem. 
It doesn't seem to like the "chari" conversion. You can just do: cname = CType(Me.Controls("textbox" &amp; i), TextBox) Not necessary to do a string conversion on the integer as VB implicitly casts it in string concatenation.
I get the same error: Conversion from string "textbox1" to type 'Integer' is not valid.
Thanks, I'll give that a try.
This is bizarre. The controls collection has a property to retrieve a control based either on an integer index or a string-based key. For some reason, your VB is not letting us do the latter. What's your .NET framework version? As a workaround, try this: cname = CType(Me.Controls.Item("textbox" &amp; i), TextBox)
Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Version 10.0.40219.1 SP1Rel Microsoft .NET Framework Version 4.5.50938 SP1Rel I am still getting the same error. I must be doing something wrong.
http://i.imgur.com/4j1pxVQ.png Looks like item takes an integer, which explains the message. So, how do I make this right?
/facepalm Lol, this entire time I was doing the examples in a regular application form and not a web application as you specified. The Web namespace has different properties for the controls collection so we'll need to work around it. Basically, we'll go through the controls in the page and if it's of type textbox, then grab the text. Dim c as Control Dim box as TextBox Dim newStr as String For each c in Me.Controls If TypeOf(c) is TextBox then box = CType(c, TextBox) newStr = box.Text End If Next
This did it!!! I will edit to add my code.
Can you show the code that you have tried?
For clarification is this an Outlook form or is this an Excel workbook you wish to send an email from? 
Sorry about the long wait I was on holidays :) you need [Naudio](http://mark-dot-net.blogspot.ca/2008/06/introducing-naudio-net-audio-toolkit.html) It allows the playing and gathering of streams and pushing out of audio through Direct Sound or ASIO. This tool would allow you to mix on the fly and send to an output. **-Bone**
Let me clear this up a bit. When you want to show a form it is traditional to create a new instance of the form and use the show method to show the form. Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Dim NewForm As New Form1 NewForm.Show() End Sub You can pass the information by creating a custom property on the form. Here I added a property that on the change of it sets the form title text to the passed property. You could have a property that can be passed ANY type of object. Most commonly I use a custom class that defines each of the objects types and values. Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Dim NewInfo As String = "Test Form" Dim NewForm As New Form1 NewForm.BarText = NewInfo NewForm.Show() End Sub Private _BarText As String Public Property BarText() As String Get Return _BarText End Get Set(ByVal value As String) _BarText = value Me.Text = _BarText End Set End Property
Please consider not using VBS anymore powershell is much more rounded and is the accepted standard these days. COM components are being left to die as they should be.
Wow! This is awesome! Is there any programs that do this already? I have a feeling with this, There are a bunch out there.
What does it say is wrong? Error message? What? Just by looking at the code, it appears you're adding 10 to the age, before you ask the user to input their age.
Yes. I seemed to figure it out. Unlike in C++, you have to declare the variable after the input of ageStr. Thank you for your help though :)
Code is in Excel currently.
Format the code and I should be able to help you.
Can you please share all the ones you know! I only posted this to MAYBE make my own. But now that you said there are many, I got excited. I would please share them! Thanks!
I would not use the Outlook COM object use the embedded ActiveWorkbook.Sendmail something like this. Sub Mail_sheets() Dim MyArr As Variant Dim last As Long Dim shname As Long Dim a As Integer Dim Arr() As String Dim N As Integer Dim strdate As String For a = 1 To 253 Step 3 If ThisWorkbook.Sheets("mail").Cells(1, a).Value = "" Then Exit Sub End Application.ScreenUpdating = False last = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("mail").Cells(Rows.Count, _ a).End(xlUp).Row N = 0 For shname = 1 To last N = N + 1 ReDim Preserve Arr(1 To N) Arr(N) = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("mail").Cells(shname, a).Value Next shname ThisWorkbook.Sheets(Arr).Copy strdate = Format(Date, "dd-mm-yy") &amp; " " &amp; _ Format(Time, "h-mm-ss") ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs "Part of " &amp; ThisWorkbook.Name _ &amp; " " &amp; strdate &amp; ".xls" With ThisWorkbook.Sheets("mail") MyArr = .Range(.Cells(1, a + 1), .Cells(Rows.Count, _ a + 1).End(xlUp)) End With ActiveWorkbook.SendMail MyArr, ThisWorkbook.Sheets("mail").Cells(1, a + 2).Value ActiveWorkbook.ChangeFileAccess xlReadOnly Kill ActiveWorkbook.FullName ActiveWorkbook.Close False Application.ScreenUpdating = True Next a End Sub
 Hi! I have use this code: Private Sub dgv1_RowEnter(sender As Object, e As DataGridViewCellEventArgs) Handles dgv1.RowEnter Dim a As Integer = 0 dgv1.Rows.Clear() For a = 0 To dgv1.Rows.Count - 1 dgv2.Rows.Add(dgv1.Rows(a).Cells(0).Value) Next a End Sub
I have used this code for 2 grids. Now with 3 grids I don't know how to do it. &gt; Private Sub dgv1_RowEnter(sender As Object, e As DataGridViewCellEventArgs) Handles dgv1.RowEnter &gt; &gt; &gt; Dim a As Integer = 0 &gt; dgv1.Rows.Clear() &gt; &gt; For a = 0 To dgv1.Rows.Count - 1 &gt; &gt; dgv2.Rows.Add(dgv1.Rows(a).Cells(0).Value) &gt; &gt; Next a &gt; &gt; End Sub 
IMO, either is fine. You are really only duplicating the call to SetMetadata, so I wouldn't worry about that. I personally would probably lean towards keeping the cases separated (the first version) as it makes the code a more readable IMO. 
depends on the rest of the case. I might do: Dim rundownElement As RundownElement For Each fieldMap As FieldMapping In fieldMaps Select Case elementType.ToUpper Case "METADATAITEM" rundownElement = New SubElement(xElmMosartItem) Case "METADATASTORY" rundownElement = New StoryElement(xElmMosartStory) end select SetMetadata(fieldMap, xElmMosStoryItem, rundownElement) Next you'll also notice I put the Dim outside the loop, there's no advantage to re-declaring it in every iteration, and there's possible disadvantages.
I would prefer the top, it seems more organised to me ^^'
Try .value = Now.ToString
Easiest way is to output CSV - VB is particularly good at plain text. Then open with Excel. Another way is to use EPPlus - http://epplus.codeplex.com/ - it's a free library/dll which allows you to create excel files, add data, formulae, charts, etc. It's pretty easy to use - put the dll in the bin folder, reference it and add the Import statement to make the library routines available to your code. Then modify the example code which you can google. I've used both methods. The former is best if you only need to get numbers into the sheet and can add formulae and fonts later. The latter is if you need to edit an existing sheet and/or format its appearance from the get go. 
&gt; ter is if you thank you so much. been years since i messed around with VB and having such a hard time getting it to output to excel. 
Thanks for the link to EPplus that shows a lot of promise to replace a commercial library I am using. **-Bone**
Write it in VBA within excel, or create an excel OLE object in your vb project
If it's a newer version of office, use the Microsoft.office.interop functions. Direct control of all aspects of excel from VB.net. On mobile, no link, sorry.
you could also use the excel DLL and create a new doc object and then use it's save function to create the new file. This will give you the ability to format cells and such. Sorry I wasn't very informative but I just wanted to let you know that route exists. Edit: I just noticed the post by everyonelikesme, that's the API I was talking about. I recommend that if you do need anything that exporting a csv cannot provide.
This is a third method I forgot. I've used this to load a template Word file and perform a search and replace with elements from a database, with certain rules and a dialog presented to the user. The only caveat is that it needs MS Office (a newish version) to be installed. 
only thing I can think of is where you have placed. make sure it's not inside some other function ro sub.
Ah, that's ok. The basic idea is that you're going to need to give a key to all nodes in your tree so you can find them later. Then to add child nodes, you just find your target parent node and tack them on. Here's an example of assigning keys and names: Dim nodeKey as Integer Dim nodeName as String nodeKey = 777 nodeName = "Parent Node" Me.myTreeView.Nodes.Add(nodeKey, nodeName) Now finding our target node and adding a child node (whose key is 888): Dim nodeArr as TreeNode() nodeArr = Me.myTreeView.Nodes.Find("777", True) If nodeArr.Length &gt; 0 Then nodeArr(0).Nodes.Add("888", "New Child Node") End If You can apply this concept to add as many nodes as you'd like. Just make sure you have unique keys.
For web page interaction, I would load the page in a web browser control and then do something like [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17921351/simulating-a-link-click-webbrowser-control-vb-net).
Thanks for the response! I found the solution.
&gt; TreeView.Nodes(1).Nodes(TreeView.Nodes(1).Nodes(Index2)).Nodes.Add("Next part") The .Nodes() method needs an index/key. Your "TreeView.Nodes(1).Nodes(Index2)" returns only a node collection, not a valid index.
You can use the Find method. In your previous code snippet, you're retrieving an index based on your key variable "name". Instead, you can just use Find to return a TreeNode array and just get the first item in that array. Dim nodeArr as TreeNode() nodeArr = Me.myTreeView.Nodes.Find(name, True) If nodeArr.Length &gt; 0 Then nodeArr(0).Nodes.Add(someNewKey, someNewName) End If
I know nothing about VB and I want to create macros to change font color. Where should I start? 
The difference is that the first has the fully qualified namespace of the command. In practice it means that a program that only contains Sub Main() Console.WriteLine("loud farts") End Sub should not compile and give an error, while the programs Imports System Sub Main() Console.WriteLine("quiet farts") End Sub OR Sub Main() System.Console.WriteLine("dog farts") End Sub will compile and run fine. edit: namespaces aren't as prevalent (or at least talked about) in vb as they are in c# - [check the msdn docs for more info](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zt9tafza.aspx) 
I'm pretty new with VB(2010); I have a sheet with a button and a textbox. I also have an excel file with two colums. One column is the ID and the other column are just sentences. I would like the following to happen: When I push the button, it randomly chooses an ID from the excel document and then displays the sentence in the textbox. Is that possible? If so, how would I program it? Thank you

HEY! That's some major context! Thanks!
No worries.
Maybe the best approach would be inserting a MsgBox displaying what are the colors your code can find, then changing the code to use these colors: If r.HighlightColorIndex &lt;&gt; wdNoHighlight Then MsgBox r.HighlightColorIndex 'Display the color so you can use it later By the way, you can remove all your "With"s because you are not actually using them. 
Assign the values to the ".Formula" property: range("A4").Formula = "=Sum(A1:A3)"

Hi, I have been writing scripts with VBA for a few years now, pretty much exclusively in Excel. I want to take things to the next level in a couple of ways: * I want to take my programs to the next level since they basically just run within Excel and require a few initial steps. I want the programs to be able to retrieve files and data on its own and interact with other programs. * I want to learn more about interacting with websites. I want to be able to scrape data from a site and I want to be able to interact with APIs. * I want to pull this data from websites into an object and be able to do things with it. Push a selection of it to a database. Push a selection of it to Excel or Word. Loop through the data and store down specifics in files. * I want to be able to store data, say, sports data that is on a website and then store it in a database I create and then be able to query it. I'm not sure if any of that makes sense or if it is all over the place. 
Thank you for the response! Unfortunately, because of the way the program is structured, stuffing the values into an array is substantially faster than running formula for each of 30 or so values in hundreds of sheets. I've tried formula and while it does work, it's not exactly what I'm looking for.
I'm not quite clear on what it is you're trying to do. You want to put formulas into an array and have them work in the sheet? If you need to speed up inserting the formulas into the sheets, you can turn off screen updating and auto-recalc until you're done. This will save a lot of time since Excel won't be continuously evaluating the formulas.
I've got nothing to add, but thank you for updating and sharing your solution!
This is very vague, but if I have three identical servers I want to run load tests on in quick succession, how could I do it in the same test file? How could I mimic the process of multiple computers accessing these servers? Thanks.
Roslyn is probably the best way to go about doing this. Sorry I'm not able to help you any further.
Use the System.CodeDom.Compiler.CodeDomProvider.... to try to compile the code in memory. You create a new VisualBasic.VBCodeProvider, and pass it the code as a string to compile (along with some parameters). It returns a CompilerResults object that will contain a list of errors if they exist. Something like this will get you the basics: Private Sub testCode(Source As String) Dim provider As CodeDomProvider = New Microsoft.VisualBasic.VBCodeProvider() Dim params As New CompilerParameters() Dim results As CompilerResults With params .GenerateExecutable = False .GenerateInMemory = True .IncludeDebugInformation = True .ReferencedAssemblies.Add(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly.Location) 'reference to me .ReferencedAssemblies.Add("System.Windows.Forms.dll") .ReferencedAssemblies.Add("System.dll") 'add more references here... End With results = provider.CompileAssemblyFromSource(params, Source) End Sub You'll need to provide all references to the compiler, as it won't know about them the way VS does. I believe the smallest unit of code you can compile is a Class, so you may have to place the user code into a basic class and sub/function to get it to compile. 
Oh, this is just awesome! Thank you!

Most tutorials I could find made it so that I can not use my own mouse anymore and that the application has to be visible all the time. I only know VB but if there is standalone software for that (outside of macro's) it'd be okay too.
Couple of thoughts: For normal automation: I use Auto-It for any of my "bot" related functions, fishing in video games, clicking one thing then another over and over. It has very little overhead and pre-written functions for pixel detection and a very simple api for executing mousemoves and keypresses. You aren't looking for that though, you would like to still use your PC. What about running your app in a virtual machine running on your main machine? (VMWare) The downside here being that you have to allocate a good bit of resources to the VM. I would say 2gb of ram + a core of your processor is a decent minimum. If that sounds like a lot then I wouldn't go that route. Now in VB, Would it be possible to just use a browser control and navigate to webpages and pass it querystring? Maybe you can manipulate session variables? I would play around with a browser control in a vb form to see what I can do without specifically using the mouse. Maybe you can use sendkeys to send key strokes to your form. I don't think this will take away your ability to use the keyboard elsewhere but I could be totally wrong, haven't used this in a while. So my suggestions (order isn't really important, up to your preference), 1. Auto-it 2. VMWare 3. vb webbrowser control, sendkeys (tab+tab+enter) or changing the url manually passing querystrings you can also get an image of your form and search it for a certain color pixel then click at that X &amp; Y coordinate. If you find a route you like and need help I should be able to help you, I was just brainstorming ideas here. Sorry this ended up so long winded. 
I'm trying to get the full path of a mapped network drive, so I can check it against what it is supposed to be. I have tried a myriad of things but can't seem to get the result I need. Doing this in VBscript, if it makes a difference. ( I know the key differences between VB and VBScript, don't know if there's too much code / syntax difference though ) Things like Set objFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject") Set objNetwork = CreateObject("Wscript.Network") strOriginalDrive1 = objFSO.GetAbsolutePathName("I:") in any case, they either return only the drive letter, or if I point them to a specific folder / file , "tasks" for example, it will show me the full path, But I can't rely on a folder or a file always being in the share. Idealy it would provide me with something like "I:\\ServerName\ShareName

I have written a few apps for my current employer that use excel and VB as datasources &amp; output. I'm 99.999% positive this can be done. It's not going to be a super easy task as you can tell by just looking over this code. I'm really tired or I would try and give a little more helpful information. The only thing I can really offer at the moment is confirmation that it can be done as long as you push through the problems. Just break down what you need to do piece by piece and you should be able to write it from scratch using this and google as resources. Random thoughts: Read the excel doc, if you can't properly read it using the dll then export the excel comma delimited. Either way have your program make a "list" (array of strings or list of strings or datatable, whatever data structure you fancy. read in the word document preferably using the functions by importing the microsoft word dll's. I'm pretty sure there is one that allows you to manipulate / read word docs. If not, export the text to a simple text file. Read everything in to a string. now you have a list and a string. Loop through your list, search your string, do what you need to do to generate your output. Save this using the microsoft word dll's we talked about earlier by creating / saving a new document object (guessing based on my experience with excel) If that can't be achieved then I would just save it as a txt file. Best of luck to you, sorry my post couldn't be more informative. I'm tired and didn't feel like researching on google atm. 
^ This ^ .... So much this. 
Thanks for the reply. You've given me hope. I'm sure it can be done too. I have already done close to what I need, but the code comes up a bit short. New issue is that my declared variable is a string which cannot contain all the values I need to compare with, I'll probably need an array. I'll keep at it and post the solution if/when I have it.
the easiest vb object to work with in that case is a list(of string) 
check the length of the selection and change format based upon the length. should be somthing like Dim WordLen as integer Wordlen = len(Selection.Find.Text) if wordlen =5 then ' Do 5 length here else ' do 6 length here end if I would also suggest checking with the /r/vba guys as well. I am not as versed in word macros as I would like. **Bone** 
Thanks for your reply. Where would I insert this? What currently seems to affect the formatting is the (^#^#^#^#^#) part. Edit: silly reddit format. The up caret and pound signs is what I was referring to.
According to this [article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff821389(v=office.15\).aspx), it looks like you need to call the Shapes collection in order to add new charts.
i have a few variables that need to be carried from form to form. would a class i call to initialize a value then call that class into each program or what?
That could work if you initialised the class at a project level. However, if these variables are not associated with each other (and therefore logically not part of the same class), you may wish to consider using form level variables and then referencing those variables instead. For instance, at the top of Form 1, right after Public Class Form1: Public formLevelVariable1 as Integer Later, in form 2, you can reference that variable with: If form1.formLevelVariable1 &gt; 0 Then ... 
form2.topmost = true http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/ecda743a-0736-4c3a-a245-ca9721478dec/how-to-stop-notification-area-show-hidden-icons-covers-my-form-when-clicking-notification-icon?forum=winforms (i'll leave this here in case someone else asks later)

if you were to save a picture box as an image, and you have textboxs over the picture box, does it save the image inside the picturebox and the textbox text or just the image?
OK time for you to look at a diffrent technology. The best way to do this is to use the built in reporting functionality of visual studio. I have no idea what version of Visual Studio you are using, but all of them have built in report writers. If you can tell me your development environment I can give you some more information. **-Bone**
Sql server reporting services is one possability. If you really want to keep this bare bones you could create a bitmap object and draw to it. Draw the background as the image and then draw each of the text items over that. You could then use the print functions to print an image and pass it the bitmap you made. Just another idea. Good luck!
I've had terrible experiences with saving forms as image files. It never works well and automatic cropping is never consistent for me. How would I do this... VB works well with MS Word. Set up a word document with watermarks, logos... all the usual stuff. Add a table to the document and save it. If the user (your Dad) requests a receipt for a job, VB can call up the word document and fill out all the details automatically. Then you can save, archive, print and even forward it on as a pdf if an email was provided. Just duplicate the special receipt in word. You'll be surprised how accurate you can get it and it will look more professional then printing out a scan.
Actually this is a great idea you can use the rs controls and even export to pdf or print 
Hi! I'm taking my first foray into excel userforms. So far I've figured out how to make a multi select userform populate a single cell with comma separation for me (probably need to add a close event), and boy let me tell you how exciting that was after working on it for three hours. My problem is that when I end select no values I get a debug error. I know there is some way to express that if it's nul just leave the field blank but I don't know how do put that in there. Can one of you show me? &gt; Private Sub BtnClose_Click() &gt; Dim s As String, i As Integer With LstCombatOptions For i = 0 To .ListCount - 1 If .Selected(i) = True Then s = s &amp; .List(i) &amp; ", " Next i End With Range("P38").Value = Left(s, Len(s) - 1) End Sub EDIT: I've tried adding If .Selected(i) = False Then s = s &amp; " " it seems to kind of work, but the additional spaces I'm adding continue to pile up in there. I'd like to be able to wipe those out in any event. 
If i understand your question correctly you're trying to save an image of the forms current state to a file? If so, .NET controls have a method called DrawToBitmap() which will get you a bitmap of the control's current state. Here's some C# code to do this (should be similar in VB): Bitmap formBitmap = new Bitmap(this.Size.Width, this.Size.Height); this.DrawToBitmap(formBitmap, new Rectangle(0, 0, formBitmap.Width, formBitmap.Height)); // Save new bitmap to a file formBitmap.Save("PATH TO SAVE IMAGE TO"); This can have some issues like sub controls not rendering properly, ect. You can read up on this method here [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.control.drawtobitmap%28v=vs.110%29.aspx?cs-save-lang=1&amp;cs-lang=vb#code-snippet-1](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.control.drawtobitmap%28v=vs.110%29.aspx?cs-save-lang=1&amp;cs-lang=vb#code-snippet-1)
It fails for the empty text boxes because an empty string isn't a number. You can use [Double.TryParse](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/994c0zb1\(v=vs.110\).aspx) to attempt a conversion and then only add it to the total if it was successful. For i = 1 To 5 Dim dayTotal As Double = 0 If Double.TryParse(Me.Controls("txt" &amp; day &amp; i)).Text, dayTotal) Then total = total + dayTotal End If Next
Excellent, that was perfect. I hadn't considered that the empty text boxes were causing a problem. Thanks for the help. For anybody in the future reading this, the above code has one extra close parentheses that you'll need to get rid of. The code should look like If Double.TryParse(Me.Controls("txt" &amp; day &amp; i).Text, dayTotal) Then Also, be sure to tell our insect overlords that I always supported them.
No code but here is how it should be done. http://www.mazeworks.com/mazegen/mazetut/
I would suggest the HTTPrequest object. Once you have that you can use REGex to find all links and parse them, then call the object again to inject what you need. **Bone**
From an old Dog who runs a very large team. If you are thinking another developer will have to pick up your code down the road write it long hand so it it is easier to pick it up. having said that I like loop once for all instances of the condition not the loop on a specific condition. The second way also allows for multiple conditions to be addressed if needed. I also find it wasier to read.
I've encountered this one, but I don't remember anything meaningful about it :(. Have you tried using the Jet provider? Since you're connecting to an Access database, you may have more luck with that.
Is there syntax somewhere for the Jet? What if I want to connect to Microsoft sql?
You can find just about every connection string you could want at [ConnectionStrings.com](http://www.connectionstrings.com/), including a long page on connecting to Access. Here's the basics for Jet: *Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=c:\myDb;*
Thanks for that
How would you send the information from the form to the word document?
If it's all the same project, then in the /bin/debug folder of the project you'll find a single exe. 
You might be better off retrieving and parsing the "lite" version of the high scores: http://services.runescape.com/m=hiscore_oldschool/index_lite.ws?player=iCapxer That way each row is clearly indicated by a grouping of 3 numbers separated by commas, with rows separated by spaces. If you wanted to use the full version, then you'd probably have to split it at tab characters since that's how they should be delimited on the page, and then do something with that/instead of tabs.

there are so many 3rd party licensed things in vb6 that this will never happen.
I don't think that pure VB6 IDE has any 3rd party thing in it, because it's signed by Microsoft's Visual Studio team. And, never say never. ;)
I used to have so much fun when I was a VB6 coder. I'd love to see it come back.
vb 1.0 was created under contract by a team led by Alan Cooper. they were not MS employees and there was no "Visual Studio Team". MS bought the technology that was to become Visual Basic. in fact, VB1.0 was actually a mashup of 2 technologies as Cooper's prototype was just the designer, and the basic language came from their failed Omega precursor to Access. At no point was there a ground-up rewrite by MS employees. vb6 is the result of gradual improvement and integration of 3rd party components. Some of these components MS bought out-right, some they licensed and the copyright still belongs to someone else. MS's licensing deals are pretty strong, and rarely can you tell what MS owns whole and what they don't. I don't believe for a minute that MS wholly owns all the code that would be needed to open source enough of the system to make it still usable by current VB6 users. I like to be proven wrong and see the code released, but I'm pretty sure it'll never happen. What I think is more likely is that MS will reconsider abandoning it and fix some of the rather minor but real bugs that keep it from working on newer OS versions. This is an update I'd even consider paying for, as there are so many vb6 apps and cost to port them to .NET is very very great. 
I mostly agree with you for new apps and for simple apps, but for apps with many forms and database connections and activeX add-ins from UI components and 3rd party libraries for all sorts of communications, both to PCI devices and network objects, down to in-house made libraries to automate and wrap up all sorts of business processes, the cost of porting is very very high. it's not just a matter of copying over a few functions. it would take months to get the libraries ported just to get started on the applications, and in the meantime business goes on and features and bug fixes have to get added to the old code. 
Exactly ... it's based on nearly dead technology (COM), 32 bit only, etc. It's also a horrible IDE compared to modern VS. 
We also refuse to do new development in it, and charge a super premium price for the one client that still has some VB6. 
It's not really a trend after 12 years. And VB.NET is a first class language. 
On the contrary, it's much simpler for absolute beginners with no knowledge of developing in such environments. So, it isn't horrible at all.
VB.NET has no problems consuming COM based libraries though. You don't have to port everything. Or at the least, you can port in pieces. VB.NET applications can use a VB6 DLL or an OCX, etc..
VB6 runtime is under official support until somewhere like 2022 I believe. VB6 IDE is a totally different story, and is not officially supported at all anymore, or on any modern OS.
That's the reason why this video is created. Why to port complex VB6 applications to .NET and still use COM libraries as there are no rapid solutions, what's the purpose of that? Also, such ported applications will run (and eventually work) slower than original, because it will take more time to load additional .NET components into memory. That's just complicating, and it's totally unnecessary.
It is actually called VB 7, 7.1, 8, 9, 10, 11 by the product team. Visual Studio (used for multiple languages, in multiple versions) is labeled with the year system (2005, 2008, 2012' etc). 
I've just had a lot of problems with projects consuming COM. It could just be the third party components that were involved. I guess in the end it depends upon where most of your code to migrate is. If you have a lot of VB6 UI, then it could be faster to start with the libraries like we did. If you have mostly library code, then you could start with the UI in .NET, and consume the VB6 libraries. 
VB6 was great because you could easily access any Windows API even if it wasn't supported in MFC or .NET or other wrapper. 85% of everything was super-simple drag and drop with code-sense auto-complete in the IDE, and for the other 15% YOU COULD GET DOWN TO THE METAL. Create an ASM or C DLL and call the functions in it, or take advantage of the power of Windows native DLLs. Maybe we should push MS to open-source VB6 for the 25th anniversary? If it happens I vote for adding a compiler option for compiling static EXEs. That has always been a dream of mine because I used to write small utility programs and I wanted them to be stand-alone.
Yes, but the point is that it's officially labelled as .NET and everyone except product team calls it like that (you won't find anyone else that says VB7), because it's so different than VB6 and therefore it's confusing for naming it VB7 or similar.
this is what needs to change. they are basically implying that an app written with vb6 can't possibly have any bugs or security issues. I'm I really to keep an XP system just for fixing them? 
I have a Vista Virtual Machine strictly for VB6. 
Not even remotely. The programs are better and faster than they ever were, we can properly run several as Windows Services now, and every line of new code we've written has been cheaper and easier to write in .NET. We are also able to use the .NET libraries behind our ASP.NET code, so we get double duty out of every one of them saving thousands of hours of development and debugging. It was either that or throw it all away and start over from scratch. 
I agree with that, I use 3rd party tools for expanding VB6 IDE functionality, too. But, you said that you worked in VB6 for 12 years, and that's not so little. I guess that if Microsoft's VS team continued with developing Classic VB, you won't consider moving on .NET or any other platform, but like they didn't do so, you had been forced to move on and waste time in porting applications.
Many companies are still facing the problem with porting applications, because in this case they must hire some senior .NET programmers to do that not-so-easy job.
File IO in VB6 is substantially slower than our .NET variants, and in our situations .NET is faster. We also have the ability to use background threads now in a way that makes many of our tasks much faster. For instance in VB6 we could only talk to some network hardware one piece at a time, where the .NET version can send all 10 devices to a background thread and handle them simultaneously. First run (after a reboot) on a very large .NET app can be slower as JIT happens, but once that's done once it's no longer an issue. All of our stuff is long running, so it really doesn't matter. We also get the benefit of compiling as 64 bit natively, so that helps with memory management. 
There's no luck involved in anything, I was the senior developer for the company, and we decided as a company to move the product from one platform to the other. We didn't hire any new programers. We only spent 20% of that 8 years porting (less than 2 years total), and as I've said repeatedly, it actually more than paid for itself, as it's faster and easier to write code in .NET once you spend a few months using it. 
Sure, and Microsoft never said it wouldn't work, they just said they don't support it. That just means if it doesn't work, don't look to them for help, and don't expect a fix.
Anything but XP for me :P The Vista VM was a physical machine that I moved to Virtual to keep from having to reload everything. It's the last VB6 environment that we built years ago (when Vista came out), and with so many third party VB6 tool (most no longer made), I'd rather not reinstall any of it! I have a few stability issues in Vista as well. I think it's a third party toolbar or button control, but if I launch the project without displaying the main form in the IDE first, it crashes VB6.
So why VB6 is still popular? I think that the main reason is it's IDE simplicity, and therefore it satisfies much developers who don't need massive framework and other stuff that comes with it to work with.
there are certainly use cases that make porting worth it. I do none of the things you listed, and my biggest app might use 150MB ram at peak, maybe...I'm unable to get it over 60MB at the moment. threading would be nice for loading some data into grids, but I only have a couple forms where it would have any perceived benefit at all. I just can't find the ROI here. it doesn't exist in this use case. 
I'm confused r=1 choice 4?

Save the list box values to a file delimited by a comma. You can then read them in and split each line by commas which will give you back your three values together. Personally, I would have tackled this slightly differently... For the recipe entry form: I would have Recipe name and number of people to serve as text boxes and the ingredients can be a listbox that you can add as many ingredients (and amounts) as you like. When you save, you divide the ingredient amount by the number of people it serves to get an amount per person. Save the file as "Recipe_Cake.csv" and then you'll have the recipe title as a file name ("Cake" in this case) and all the ingredients inside per person.. it means you can have 100's of ingredients if you want. When you need to call the recipe later you multiply the ingredients up, I would put an "egg clause" in the code. If the ingredients contains an egg then you need to make sure the displayed recipe gives a whole egg. Just round up and add the word "approx."
Something like this should work nicely: Public Function CloseScript() As KfxReturnValue dim returnValue as KfxReturnValue = KFX_REL_SUCCESS 'assume success at this point try ' Release the batch information to the Database oDB.ReleaseBoxTrackingBatch(DocumentData) If (Not bOpen) Then bOpen = False End If catch(ex as exception) oError.LogTheError(Err, Err.Description, M_RELEASE + ":" + Err.Source, Erl, False, False) oError.DataObject = Nothing returnValue = KFX_REL_ERROR 'flag error value end catch return returnValue End Function Basically you were correct in changing the wrapping of the OnError to the Try, and placing the Err_close... in the catch. By moving things around like I did, you eliminate the GoTo completely, and clean up the logical flow. There are a number of advantages to try / catch, including the ability to run a Finally block (to ensure that something happens even if an error occurs), nice logical program flow (as opposed to jumping around with GoTo and Resume statements), exception objects in .NET are very precise and verbose, as opposed to the very generic err.number in the old style OnError code making it much easier to get very detailed error information into your log. Another huge improvement is nested Try / Catch statements ... using OnError required you to use a single handler for the entire routine, where you can actually wrap individual lines if needed with Try /Catch. The numbers on those lines were line numbers. The were not being used for anything in this instance, but could also be used for GoTo calls (GoTo 100 instead of GoTo Exit_CloseScript), or to log the actual line of code (erl) that threw the error.
Thanks for your help, I will defineitly look into using csv files instead of text files
As you're adding the subitem to the listview, use StrConv with the VbStrConv.ProperCase enum lvi.SubItems.Add(StrConv("your text value", VbStrConv.ProperCase))
~~I think that VB6 allowed you to call into a default value (by doing the cast for you), but this isn't supported in .NET (and really shouldn't be).~~ ~~In the end, it makes your intent much clearer when you are referencing the property in the control, rather than casting the controls default value to a variable type.~~ Edit: Bad answer ... not paying attention here ... 
My bad ... I wasn't paying enough attention, and thought this was a .NET question, not realizing it was a VB6 or VBA question. Yea, VB6/VBA was really bad with the whole 0/1 thing. In VB6 there is a "vbChecked" constant that you can at least compare to, not sure about VBA if that's what you are using: If check1.Value = vbChecked then 'do something here end if I actually had a function to convert checkbox values to and from Boolean in our VB6 code, just to make it easier for binding up lots of checkBoxes to settings. Something like: Function IsChecked(Value as integer) as Boolean If Value = vbChecked then IsChecked = True else IsChecked = False end if End Function I had a similar "SetCheck" sub that took the boolean and checkbox as parameters to set them. 
Got ya, I've not worked in VBA in dozens of years, and VB.NET checkBoxes have proper boolean properties. Personally, if your concern is someone coming behind and questioning it then I'd use the vbChecked / vbUnchecked / vbGreyed constants. 
I think that IsNot is perfectly fine, and you really aren't losing anything switching. You just have to think through the line of code to ensure that you are not switching to a negative case. Overall it's not bad looking, but there are a couple of things that I'd change: * If you're not required to use line breaks get rid of them. Back when 640 * 480 was a standard screen size they helped to keep all the code on screen. Now that most developers have wide screen monitors, and desktop resolutions are much larger, they really serve no purpose other than to make the code harder to read (IMO). Unless the code passes beyond the edge of the active window they serve no purpose, and I actively discourage them in my shop. * Dump MsgBox for MessageBox.Show. MessageBox is cleaner and more powerful, and is not VB specific (it's framework wide). You'll have to rewrite the calls a bit to get everything lined up, but it's worth it IMO. * Don't use "+" for string concatenation. "+" is for math, "&amp;" is for joining strings together into a new string. Even in VB6 this shouldn't have been done, but it often was. The only broken bit I see is with the Catch. When using Try / Catch you need to catch an error of some sort. The err object won't exist for you to use, as it's used for OnError. You also won't be able to raise the error later, so you have to throw it in the catch. So you'll need to rework the Catch and raise like this: Try 'code here Catch ex As Exception 'exception is the lowest possible type of error you can catch... there are more precise errors that can be used in certain situations. MessageBox.Show("An error " &amp; ex.Message &amp; " happened logging this error." &amp; vbCrLf &amp; ErrMsg &amp; vbCr, titlestring, MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Exclamation) 'Throw here if needed If ReRaise = true then Throw end if End Try One way to test out the try / catch logic to see how it works is to create a simple form with at textbox and a button on it. Then try to do some math on the contents of the string (creating intentional errors by not putting numbers in the string). So with a button and a textbox on the form, the button click event would look like this: Private Sub ButtonTest_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles ButtonTest.Click Try Dim n As Double = 1 * CDbl(TextBox1.Text) Catch ex As Exception MessageBox.Show("An error " + ex.Message &amp; " happened logging this error." &amp; vbCrLf &amp; ErrMsg &amp; vbCr, titlestring, MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Exclamation) End Try End Sub as long as there are no numbers in the textbox, you'll generate an error. You can set a line break on the error to see how it reacts, and what is contained within it. 
i have no experience with .net, and im still green with 6, but 6 is bugging the crap out of me with alot of the nonsensical and shoddy things im finding. is the syntax structure similar to 6/vba? 
The syntax is similar, but with over a dozen years of upgrades and thought put into it! (VB6 is circa Windows 98). The IDE is a vastly better as well. The downside is that it's much larger, the upside is that it's much more powerful. Most of this is due to the fact that in VB6 you had to go to Win API calls to do many things, and now all of that is available directly in .NET. You also needed third party tools for a lot of things that can be done directly now as well (like sending email, talking to web servers, or compressing files). 
that sounds nifty. once i get done teachin myself 6 i'll take a crack at learning .net lol
IMO, unless you need to learn VB6 for work, I'd skip it. .NET is just as easy to learn, and you'll save yourself a lot of time and energy learning something that is very old and outdated. There's more to learn with .NET, but you don't need any more of it than you do with VB6 to get started (the IDE is basically identical). I'd start here: http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Visual-Basic-Fundamentals-for-Absolute-Beginners Grab a free copy of VS Express here: http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx 
sadly everything is Vb6 at work (yay for antiquated systems). ill take a crack at it in the future, and i'll use those resources you shot me; i appreciate it. 
And just to make sure, I need to make it work regardlessof what the field says
Well, if you're talking about doing this after the listview has been populated, then you would need to create a loop to move through all the listviewitems and set the current rows appropriate subitem equal to the strConv version of itself. Instead of "your text value" that would be replaced with the row and subitem values as appropriate to the type of loop you used (ie, for...next, for...each, etc...)
ThreadStart is a type of delegate defined in the CLR. AddressOf is also a way of taking a method group and converting it to a delegate type. The difference is whether you are implicitly or explicitly typing the delegate that you are using. For an example of the difference, compare and consider the C# and VB code snippets found at the following website: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.Threading.ThreadStart.aspx?cs-save-lang=1&amp;cs-lang=vb#code-snippet-2 Edit: Grammar Edit 2: You may also want to consider looking into Async/Await if you are unfamiliar with the language feature :)
 When would i use one over the other? It seems as though if I use ThreadTest = New Thread(addressof somesub) everything works great. So why would i use Threadstart? Im having trouble understanding the reasoning of why I would use one over the other.
I have just finished computing and got an A* in the course work this was one of my projects. You will want to use a console application to display to the user as this will be easier to handle. Use an array structures for holding the ingredient and the amount. Saving into a .txt file should be fine for GCSE level. To pause a console application you will need to use Console.Readline() If you need any help message me I will be happy to help you. 
Why are these functions and not subs? Btw you can use rows += 32 instead of rows = rows + 32. It works for minus as well.
They are functions because they used to return something. Now they don't. Guess I could change that back. I should also make those += instead of what they were. I don't think it will do much to the performance though. :/
Also, I don't know if I am not formatting my code properly, but everytime I post code on this sub, it leaves the beginning or end or both out of the code block...
That guy you linked to is an idiot... don't read anything he has to say...
How many pictureboxes do you actually have on the form? Your code would suggest you have LOTS of them. I have no idea what your program does, but there is a good chance you would be better off using a graphics context and drawing the images to a single canvas at the needed x/y coordinates versus loading tons of individual pictureboxes and moving them all around on the form.
C# and VB both actually don't need it. C++ does. From ThreadStart documentation: Visual Basic and C# users can omit the ThreadStart or ParameterizedThreadStart delegate constructor when creating a thread. In Visual Basic, use the AddressOf operator when passing your method to the Thread constructor; for example, Dim t As New Thread(AddressOf ThreadProc). In C#, simply specify the name of the thread procedure. The compiler selects the correct delegate constructor. 
I can probably provide or link some examples, but I guess I would need to know what you do with 1500 pictureboxes on a form. That is a pretty crazy amount. You don't have to run down the entire program or its purpose, but what do you use the pictureboxes for? Loading 1500 pictures and moving them around?
I made you up an example, you can just create a new winform application and paste this in and run it. This should at least give you an idea of what you could do with custom drawing events. I made this up real quick as an example, so its obviously pretty basic, but I was [able to make this quickly](http://imgur.com/XQ8A4tj) using it.

Your example works, but the X and Y offsets are constant. I would need to make it so the left and right arrows allow you to move the map so people with smaller screens can see. Could I just make the offsets not constant and set up some keyboard events? 
Yes, it is fully dynamic so you can set any of that stuff up ahead of time in the code.
How would you add this to an excel workbook? 
That is all the code? You have GoTo statements that have no line entry, like CTD_LogAndPropError, you also have a sub call to CleanUpDBConnection and that method is not defined in what you posted. So it is hard to know everything going on here when it looks like there are missing pieces.
thanks... edited original comment and confirmed that fixes it.
I left off the error handler sorry. Adding it in now. 
We were actually given a client - the teacher who is head of the nursing department for the college. We had to download her entire binder full of resources, and turn them into media pdf files to be opened and read in a database. We created the database using Access, and are storing the pdf files by their names, dates, and are available through categories and "keywords" in a search box. We are looking to figure out how to connect the files in the database to a combo box inside the VB code. There is no written assignment for this. Our teacher just decided to let us "wing it" and hasn't helped in the slightest. I can give more information if anyone is willing to help.
Add a column containing the file path of the pdf file and store that. Then use that to populate the combo box.
Thanks for the tip!
I don't use it actively. I have some old programs that I have for my own personal use that I've not been bothered to rewrite. That said, VB6 was my main language for nearly 10 years. If I could go back in time I'd move to C#/VB.NET a lot sooner than I did. I was an idiot for sticking with such a weak, unexpressive language for so long. I'd still prefer VB6 to THEOS Corona BASIC.
 Dim vNum as Integer Function GetNext() as String vNum=vNum+1 if vNum&gt;5 then VNum=1 GetNext = sheet1.cells(1, vNum).Value End Function Sub Button_Click() Sheet1.range("C5") = GetNext() End Sub
hey jonivy! thanks for the quick response! I am an extreme novice when it comes to this stuff. I have the 5 names in cells a1:a6. Is that wrong? When I input the code I get Compile error: User-defined type not identified I must be pulling a very noob move here
Going to be completely honest I did not understand a thing you said I'm a complete noob at VB, only other program I made was a metric to imperial converter which was very basic 
Main thing i'm unclear about is what am i declaring as a double, am i declaring the total that is in the box as a double? Also don't get what you mean with "Cast double to a string"
&gt; add(ByVal x As Integer) &gt; total += x &gt; End Sub I had the Dim Total As Double, So is the Sub add(ByVal x As Integer) total += x End Sub A sub program?, If so what area do I put this in and what is that sub actually doing?
 Dim Operation As Integer Dim Total As Double Private Sub CmdClear_Click() TxtAnswer.Text = "" End Sub Private Sub CmdDot_Click() TxtAnswer.Text = TxtAnswer.Text + "." CmdDot.Enabled = False End Sub Private Sub CmdEquals_Click() End Sub Private Sub CmdFun_Click(Index As Integer) If IsNumeric(TxtAnswer.Text) Then TxtAnswer.Text = CStr(dblTotal) Else: MsgBox ("You must enter a digit to continue") End If End Sub Private Sub CmdNum_Click(Index As Integer) TxtAnswer.Text = TxtAnswer.Text &amp; Index End Sub Private Sub Form_Load() End Sub Private Sub TxtAnswer_Change() End Sub This is what I have advanced too so far now the main issue i'm having trouble with is as the functions are all stored in an array under CmdFun how do I declare each one as say + - / *?
You'll want to use a select/case statement. http://www.vbtutor.net/vb6/lesson8.html
wanted to thank everyone for the responses, i got really caught up in my courses and completely forgot i posted this 
Did you have a final project for the class? If so, do you mind sharing what it was?
depends on which vb. not all those things are HTML. 
for instance, a clock could be javascript, or java, or flash. you could get javascript, but you'd need to have something rendering and running it and access the DOM to get at the element. for pure html, I'm sure there's some 3rd party libraries for parsing html.
... Totaly forget html only is the skeleton. 
But i can html and a little js do you where to start?
if you're expecting the JS to run, you should embed a browser control and use its DOM access. should be pretty well documented. basically, you're writing a custom web browser.
Well you have 2 options; Walk up the element's DOM ancestry tree using HtmlElement.Parent and construct the XPath manually. Use Html Agility Pack itself and do something like this (untested): Dim element As HtmlElement = Me.webBrowser1.Document.GetElementFromPoint(e.ClientMousePosition) Dim savedId = element.Id Dim uniqueId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString() element.Id = uniqueId Dim doc = New HtmlAgilityPack.HtmlDocument() doc.LoadHtml(element.Document.GetElementsByTagName("html")(0).OuterHtml) element.Id = savedId Dim node = doc.GetElementbyId(uniqueId) Dim xpath = node.XPath you will want to call this on the click event of the browser control The HTML agility pack will save you piles of grief http://htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/ Sorry man did this from memory on a machine that does not have visual studio on it. Let me know if the code is working. **Bone**
the PrivDBEngine was used to allow multiple connections to an access object in the case where you did not want to lock the original access file from somebody else editing it. It was undocumented and was used way too much. The method I am seeing above is the lazy programmer way to open a db connection. The connection was opened when the app started and it closed when the app closed. The application should have opened the connection made the changes it needed and the closed it right away. This would have precluded the need to worry about file locks by checking to see if the DB was available for transactions. Having said that how much work do you want to do? Are you retrofitting the origional application and just want it to work in VB.Net (meaning get it working but dont spend a lot of time on it) or were you interested in converting the application over to modern methods of DB access using database models and creating the tiers. Lastly upgrade your access backend to SQL Server Express its free and upgrading the database to that platform is a couple of clicks and any Access interfaces can still attach to the data source. **Bone**
I read this as "You were given a bunch of files pertaining to a client that need to be stored in a remote database" is that correct? **Bone**
Yes.
So you want to scan a folder of documents, add them to a database and then create a combobox that only shows one entry for each document?
Thanks that is pretty much what iam looking for
We (the class) has already scanned all of the documents, and created the 'database' in Microsoft Access. What we are trying to do is show the categorized database in a combo box that shows the selected documents for each category. We're also going to add a 'search' textbox that allows the use of selected keywords to find the documents. At the moment, we have most of that done, we're just trying to figure out the code to turn that into a combo box.
&gt; Arrgg iam so sorry it's Visual basic 2010 Express .NET 
Assuming this is .NET..... Dim btn As New Button '(or any other type of control) btn.Text = "click me" btn.Location = New Point(100, 100) '&lt;&lt; set this to the required location Me.Controls.Add(btn)' this adds it to the form, but if you have a container (GroupBox, Panel, etc that you want it in, you can add it to that control.controls). You can also wire the click event and set other properties at the same time. 
Thanks man 
I didnt get to try this yet. I just assumed the browser would have an onclick event, but it does not. Now I'm searching for a work around, and have only been programming for a few weeks. My skill is in Networking, but they want me to learn this for work.
So what you want to do is have a combo box that reads from a specific table in the access database and fills a combo box with the values. Here is how I would do it. Dim connStr = "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=C:\mydatabase.mdb;User Id=admin; Password=;" Dim sql = "SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;" Dim da = New SqlDataAdapter(sql, connStr) Dim dt = New DataTable da.Fill(dt) ComboBox1.DataSource = dt ComboBox1.DisplayMember = "column_name" ' the text that will show in the combo box ComboBox1.ValueMember = "column_name" ' the value that will be returned on selection. 'This is useful for it could contain the id of the record thus making it easier to add a new record to a related table. In this case we are returning only the one field so.... Let me know if that is what you are looking for. **Bone** P.S. At least give me upvotes for working on this ;)
thanks, super late reply
Additionally, you could just set the visible property to false and when you click the other button you can set it to true so to the user it looks like it appeared.
No help in this sub, removing the post
Wow thanks a bunch, it works now :)
Well it seems I have just picked the wrong language to learn. There seems to be so many more resources for C# than there are for VB. I guess I should switch to C# before I get too far ahead.
Thank you! I will let you know if that works :)
You can. I'm not sure about best practices, though. However, I have seen recommendations that it be used for validation. 
Google (web scraping) for more.
Can you provide a little more detail? Your post is confusing and it's hard to tell exactly what you're trying to do.
 Sub GoGoGo() Dim tRow as Long, tCol as Long, fromCol as Long, tempVal as string tRow = 1 tCol = 1 fromCol = 1 Do until trim(sheet1.cells(1, FromCol)) = "" tCol=tCol+1 if trim(sheet1.cells(1, FromCol)) = "BASISEINTRAG" or Mid(trim(sheet1.cells(1, FromCol)), 1, 12) = "ERGENISLISTE" then tCol=1 tRow=tRow+1 end if tempVal = sheet1.cells(1, FromCol) sheet1.cells(1, FromCol)="" sheet1.cells(tRow, tCol) = tempVal FromCol = FromCol + 1 loop End Sub I think.
You can do this: Dim myString as string = "This is a string" Dim myDate as Date = Now The two are different objects - a string being an array of characters, and a Date, an object used to store and manipulate time/date information. You can't store a reference to another variable as a string - well, not easily anyway.
&gt; An experienced coder will produce roughly 1,000 LoC per day what O_O
LOL what a fucking retard. NO ONE wants your crappy retarded abortion of a platform and language. Take your fucking dinosaur crap from the 90's elsewhere. Come back when your retarded language isn't OWNED by an evil corporation that doesn't give a fuck about it, or when your language achieves a minimum level of decency, for example by allowing arithmetic operators on numeric types such as `BigDecimal`. I'd rather keep an 8 million LOC visual basic stuff than have my penis shrink by having to use retarded java.
There's nothing really wrong with doing extra stuff in a constructor, since it's a method like everything else. However, for code readability, I feel it would be best to throw whatever preliminary operations you need to run into a sub and then call that sub from Sub New().
Your example doesn't really address the differences between an event and a sub/function. It doesn't become apparent until you're creating public classes that have their own events. The explanation is best read here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fwd3bwed.aspx
Your example doesn't leave the scope of a single class. Event raising is a useful way for classes and threads to communicate with each other. Not to mention that more than one method can subscribe to the event and be fired if the event occurs. For example, you could have a main method which spawns off multiple threads running a time consuming data processing task, each with a different input file name. Each thread can report that it is finished, or that an error occurred via RaiseEvent. 
the best information I can give you is from [Tutorial Point](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/vb.net/vb.net_web_programming.htm) it will go into detail on how to implement and then test your service with the tool supplied with Visual Studio. Secondly their is a great built in class that manages users, logins etc that are already web controls I suspect you will find everything you need in there for working with your users. [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.aspnet.identity.aspx) Bibhu Dutta has a solid article on implementation [Link](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/751897/ASP-NET-Identity-with-webforms) [Devart](http://www.devart.com/dotconnect/postgresql/docs/Identity-Tutorial.html) has another good article. **-Bone**
Thanks man -- In this tutorial: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/751897/ASP-NET-Identity-with-webforms I hit a roadblock where I need to "Add the OWIN startup class". I already added OWIN via package manager like I was told, went to add class, and OWIN not found at all. Using Visual Studio 2013 pro. I tried following the instructions again, and googling to try yet again, but to no avail. OWIN class is..no where to be found! Ugh.. 
Also a lot of the tutorials are in C# -- if anyone has VB specifically, that'd be incredible. Having to convert it in my mind, or if following examples, puts me at sort of a longer road. 
If you aren't able to follow the C#, try running the code through a converter. There are a bunch of them out there, this is just the first that I found: http://converter.telerik.com/ 
With regards to exceptions, there are (thank god) no checked exceptions in .net. Honestly your best bet is to look at the following pages: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_C_Sharp_and_Visual_Basic_.NET http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_C_Sharp_and_Java
Try adding at the top of your code base; Imports Microsoft.Owin Imports Microsoft.Owin.Security **Bone**
Awesome, sounds like a good start point. However, it sounds like that would require a specific user to log in to Windows before it would run; the ideal would be to lose that dependancy. Any thoughts?
Then you want to go with a Windows Service. Services generally run on Startup, and have no requirement to have a user log in. The only caveat is that you'll have no user interaction directly with the running service. 
So you know how to do it with a button. Just move that to the "on open" event of the form, have that form be the default that opens up. Then you can use windows task scheduler to open you access file periodically. http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/schedule-task#1TC=windows-7
SQL is the way to go here. By creating a connection and issuing the various SQL commands you can manipulate the rows. 1. Pass your connection string into the connection object 2. Open the connection 3. Create your SQL statement 4. Create a command passing it the statement and the connection 5. Execute or Instantiate a Reader Object (SELECT Statement) 5a. If using a SELECT statement, iterate through the resulting row(s) 6. Dispose objects as necessary
Ahh, that seems much simpler to implement. /u/hdsrob provided a great method but this will probably be simpler to maintain, given generally low specialist knowledge here! Thanks
There are several examples on the web: https://www.google.com/search?q=vb.net+chat+application
ive been through these but they don't seem to work, most of them are outdated. I guess i should learn all of vb and try to figure it out for myself.
More than likely but it would be a nice thing for me to know as well. What would you reccomend if any, it has to be secure
I dont mean secure asin hackable i ment trusted, if i made it i can trust it. Its hard to explaim...sorry
The program is running on .NET 4.5. I will take a look at Async/Await
There isn't a direct replacement, but there is the NumericUpDown, which has the textbox already attached to it (you had to wire them together in VB6).
Wasn't it just a VScroll, sized a tad small?
Just use 2 buttons stacked on top of each other and use the same function manage the event. **Bone**
First things first, which dialect of VB are you using? VB.NET or the older VB6? The code and advice will differ slightly based on this. If you don't know, tell us which tool you are using to edit your code.
I was giving extra info just in case no one had a template to link, but just typed a few lines instead. Man, what you said above is like what everyone else keeps telling me -- I just need some code, not a lecture. No need to take a giant course -- I've taken SQL class, I've taken VB class, but there's no class that combines the 2 (broken usa education). That said, after many hours to find real code/templates/examples to use for reference, allow me to answer my own question for anyone else interested: 1) Connection string can be copy+pasted from simply clicking on DB name under 'servers' window via the properties window (mind=blown, this one sentence knowing early is a headache saver) 2) To alter connection string to store mdf with local folder: http://www.mikesdotnetting.com/Article/234/Creating-a-Connection-String-and-Working-with-SQL-Server-LocalDB 3) And an old but awesome guide to verify u+p: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0dcPiLYrck 4) Insert data (best guide+template ever without lecture): http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/d11ed406-d9bf-4363-84b6-99f4e9ee4631/how-to-insert-data-into-sql-table-using-vbnet
I think you'd find that building such an application has some learnings that would be useful, but largely you would be bogged down with scalability and network issues as soon as you tried to deploy it in any notable capacity. If you're looking for a way to sharpen your programming skills I'd check out the Euler Project. (about to take off in a plane, don't have time to find link.)
I'd look into Web API in ASP.NET. 
Yep, it's server based and you can control access via a number of different methods. http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/security Your desktop app would just connect via HTTP and push the data as an XML or JSON package, then the server side app would convert that package and push it into the DB. 
This is fucking awful. If you are going to pretend to make tutorials that are useful at the very least teach people to name their controls properly. Textbox1. Are you fucking kidding me? Call it something like tbImWastingYourFuckingTime. This is bad and I need to know you feel bad. Tell me you feel bad. Do it.
[VB7] I'm trying to loop through two ranges at the same time. My mentor at work is out and he mentioned that what I was doing may be looping through 64 times. Background: I want to loop through two ranges within Excel at the same time. The two ranges are file paths with 8 paths in each range. I want to push the current workbook to other directories. I am new to this hence the Noob Megathread approach. ' Copy Owner Workbooks to Developer Directory and Master Workbook to Owner Directory Dim jsFSO As Object Set jsFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject") Dim jsMaster As String jsMaster = Range("push_master") For Each owner In Range("push_owners") For Each dest In Range("push_destination") If jsFSO.fileExists(owner) Then ' Copy Owner file to Developer Directory with timestamp FileCopy owner, dest ActiveWorkbook.SaveCopyAs owner Else ActiveWorkbook.SaveCopyAs owner End If Next dest Next owner
I added a counter within the loop. This looped 64 times. I'm going to retry and if I find something worth posting, I will update this thread. If someone wants to add content, it would be greatly appreciated! Thanks and have a great weekend
The simplest way to do this would be in your button click event handler. Check the buttons text value and only do the rest of your logic if it is blank.
I didn't look at all your code, but could you disable the button after its been set, then call a sub that enables all buttons when you determine a winner. Actually, you could have a sub the 'resets' the game board, so you don't have to have "Button1.Text = '', Button1.Text = "" ect in every If statement in win(). Seems like the code would look cleaner? Edit: Another option would be to use RestartGame.PerformClick(). If Button1.Text = "X" And Button2.Text = "X" And Button3.Text = "X" Then MessageBox.Show("X WINS!") ResetGame.PerformClick() End If
Thanks for the help, I did however forget to mention that all my buttons are in one handle. I'll show the code once I'm on my pc. Thanks.
I didn't look at your code either, but use picture boxes instead of buttons, and just swap the images around.
Thanks, will try!
Thanks!
You are doing something similar already where you set the Text of the button that was clicked to either "X" or "O". The only difference is that you want to set the Enabled property to False. DirectCast(sender, Button).Enabled = False
Thanks. Will try it when home.
Ok just tried it and THANK YOU SOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCHHHH!! I wish I had money to give you reddit gold!!!! Thanks!
Here's the website I'm setting up my application for: https://www.supremenewyork.com/checkout
Look up string addition or modification. Make it so if you hit 9 and there is a 4 on the label or whatever your using, add the string "9" to the "4" on the label. Then just multiply divide subtract or add the 2 numbers under each corresponding button subroutine. Hope it helps somewhat( taking first year programming, still don't know much)
I think I solved my issue this morning. I combined the two named ranges into one. Then referenced the cells in the range. ' Copy Owner Workbooks to Developer Directory and Master Workbook to Owner Directory Dim jsFSO As Object Set jsFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject") Set r = Range("push_owners") For n = 1 To r.Rows.Count If jsFSO.fileExists(r.Cells(n, 1)) Then ' Copy Owner file to Developer Directory with timestamp ' Push Master file to Owner Directory FileCopy r.Cells(n, 1), r.Cells(n, 2) ActiveWorkbook.SaveCopyAs r.Cells(n, 1) Else ' Push Master file to Owner Directory ActiveWorkbook.SaveCopyAs r.Cells(n, 1) End If Next n
From the looks of it you forgot to declare WebBrowser1 
Ok, great! Thanks for your reply. I'm not exactly sure how I would go about declaring WebBrowser1 though. Haha, don't judge too harshly!
If your running the app every night just take a log of files in the dir, and calculate how long they've been there yourself. If the goal is removing files 14 days old why does it even matter when the last access time was? Just remove files that are 14 days old based on creation date.
the modified time should be the time it was put into the folder, unless you're using some archiving or replication tool to put it there that's resetting it. windows explorer and the common copying api's do not preserve that.
Files that are put in there may already be 14 days old when they are copied there. They are given the opportunity to sit there for 14 days. There LastAccessTime will be set to the date they are copied in there if our nightly backup time didn't reset it every day.
It appears that our backup software, even though the directory is excluded from backup, is updating the LastAccessTime. Grrrr!
you want escaping. so something like this "text" would be "this ""text""" 
I am taking an introductory level VB class and need to make a game where every time I "mouseenter" the button area, it will randomly move somewhere within the 600x600 pixel form. I have gotten the program to move the button once, but I cannot find anything to make it keep moving every time I "mouseenter" the area. I apologize if this question is extremely basic, I am very confused.
Maybe you can start a new thread and post your code in that thread? It's difficult to say what could be the the problem. You've got the "mouseEnter" event, which is correct (although I would personally have gone with mouseHover instead for slightly more control, but mouseEnter should work), so it's most likely a problem with the code instead.
Maybe you can post up some of the code you've tried?
You can have a single event manage multiple objects by using the AddHandler method in conjunction with the object. For instance, if your pixels are named "pixel01" all the way to "pixel09", you can do this. addHandler pixel01.OnMouseDown AddressOf pixel_Click addHandler pixel02.OnMouseDown AddressOf pixel_Click .... Public Sub pixel_Click(ByRef sender as PictureBox, ByRef e as eventArgs) sender.BackColor = Color.White End Sub As you can see, addHandler method links the onMouseDown event (which fires whenever the user clicks on the picturebox) with the pixel_Click method that we just wrote. This means that whenever the user clicks on a picturebox, the "pixel_Click" sub is run. But how will the sub know which picturebox is the one that's being clicked on? Two things are always passed as arguments in a form control: the sender object, which refers to the picturebox firing the event, and the eventargs, which contains everything else associated with the event (we don't have to worry about that for now). If you've been following along, you'll figure out that we can use the "sender" variable to refer to the picturebox that is firing the event, AKA the picturebox that's been clicked.
You can refer to multiple objects in many ways. My personal favourite is to add all of them to a list and then use a For-Each loop to run through each of them. In the pixel example above, we can do it this way. Dim pixelList as New List(of PictureBox) pixelList.Add(pixel01) pixelList.Add(pixel02) .... For Each pixel in pixelList 'do whatever Next It's possible to write a loop that goes through each column or row of pixels, but to me it seems a little silly. Instead, it makes more sense to me to create your own custom "pixel" object and then store the PictureBox as a property in the object. Public Class pixel Public Property PictureBox as PictureBox Public Property x as Integer Public Property y as Integer End Class This way, when you iterate through each pixel in the pixelList, you don't have to care about their respective positions because it'll be reflected in the pixel object's x and y properties. All you have to do is pull it out and store it as appropriate. However, if you absolutely must go through the pixels by row or column (maybe because the ROM only accepts the data that way, I don't know), having your own custom object will still be easier. Sort the objects by x or y values and then iterate through the loop.
I ended up solving this one on my own. I read on Serializing: &gt; Dim formatter As New BinaryFormatter() &gt; Dim writeStream As New FileStream(My.Resources.Resource1.results, FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write, FileShare.None) &gt; formatter.Serialize(writeStream, listSearchResults) &gt; writeStream.Close() &gt; &gt; Dim readStream As New FileStream(My.Resources.Resource1.results, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read) &gt; listSearchResults.Clear() &gt; listSearchResults = CType(formatter.Deserialize(readStream), List(Of SearchResultRow)) &gt; readStream.Close() This still gave me the error of "Empty path name not legal.", but I got a wild hair and decided to put some text in the result.txt file that was in the internal Resources file. That solved the problem, for whatever reason. EDIT: Apparently there's a new problem. That text I put in the result.txt file in the Resources1.resx thing actually creates a file with the objects. I think I'm just going to sleep on this one and see what happens tomorrow.
keep this has a reference, and/or somewhat memorize it http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/47zceaw7.aspx you can't store a decimal/fractional number in an integer, only a whole number, that's what the word "integer" means, "whole".
Serialization creates a binary file containing the state of all of your serializable objects. So it won't be plain text.
Thank you! I actually just finished the rest of the code and made my converter work! 
Would this work if I linked to a MouseMove event? addHandler pixel01.OnMouseDown AddressOf pixel_MouseMove The ideal situation would be for the user to be able to "paint" multiple "pixels" in one stroke instead of clicking one by one. From what my messing around with it has shown, the MouseMove event will not activate while a mouse button is pressed if it's its own sub.
I've never tried to add to a resource file dynamically. I believe once the exe has been compiled (including any resources), it is "set in stone".
I cant answer your question for the first part. Are you using OLE embending, are you passing the data to a form, how is the data being passed from your program to word? In the case where you want to bring the word window to the top and make it stay there you should use the following api calls to the old user32.dll &lt;DllImport("user32.dll", SetLastError:=True, CharSet:=CharSet.Auto)&gt; _ Private Shared Function FindWindow( _ ByVal lpClassName As String, _ ByVal lpWindowName As String) As IntPtr End Function &lt;DllImport("user32.dll", EntryPoint:="FindWindow", SetLastError:=True, CharSet:=CharSet.Auto)&gt; _ Private Shared Function FindWindowByClass( _ ByVal lpClassName As String, _ ByVal zero As IntPtr) As IntPtr End Function &lt;DllImport("user32.dll", EntryPoint:="FindWindow", SetLastError:=True, CharSet:=CharSet.Auto)&gt; _ Private Shared Function FindWindowByCaption( _ ByVal zero As IntPtr, _ ByVal lpWindowName As String) As IntPtr End Function Here is the basic implementation using Notepad Dim lpszParentClass As String = "Notepad" Dim lpszParentWindow As String = "Untitled - Notepad" Dim lpszClass As String = "Edit" Dim ParenthWnd As New IntPtr(0) Dim hWnd As New IntPtr(0) ParenthWnd = FindWindow(lpszParentClass, lpszParentWindow) If ParenthWnd.Equals(IntPtr.Zero) Then Debug.WriteLine("Notepad Not Running!") Else hWnd = FindWindowEx(ParenthWnd, hWnd, lpszClass, "") If hWnd.Equals(IntPtr.Zero) Debug.WriteLine("Notepad doesn't have an Edit component, how strange.") Else Debug.WriteLine("Notepad Window: " &amp; ParenthWnd.ToString()) Debug.WriteLine("Edit Control: " &amp; hWnd.ToString()) End If End If The FindWindow function will return the handle for the given window. Once you have the handle you can then bring the window to front using &lt;DllImport("user32.dll", SetLastError:=True)&gt; _ Private Shared Function BringWindowToTop(ByVal hwnd As IntPtr) As Boolean End Function 'Or just Public Declare Function BringWindowToTop Lib "user32" (ByVal HWnd As IntPtr) As Boolean You would use this by calling the function and passing it the previous hWnd The last part is that Yes you can read it back in using the Word Document model. The questions that has to be asked is why the hell are you doing all this? Create a webform that allows the user to enter the infromation into your system. Doing it this way is just crazy. **Bone** 
So this code doesn't exactly work. We're using VB 2012, and for beginners the code that is required for this project is beyond our knowledge. We're trying to code a lot of commands that require database access, categorizing, and a way to upload new files to automatically "add" to the database for the client. Honestly the frustration of our group is very high, considering our teacher refuses to help us, and we're trying to find random code on google. I would like to thank everyone for the support and efforts in this request for help. Hopefully we can find a way to finish this without botching it.
"When a problem is to big, beak it down into smaller problems." - Me to every new programmer :) So lets start at the begining. I would like to see the way you are connecting to the database. Would it be possible for me to look at your code somehow? I would like to see your groups approach to attaching to the database. This way I can provide you with more code/information that will help. **Bone**
Wish I could give you more help, we are always here lurking so send a note or start a thread :) **Bone**
Are you going to someone elses website and trying to automatically have the terms checked? if its your own site (and only if) you are going to - you could do this two ways first (and optional depending on set up) - if the site can be reached besides just from your button, but shouldn't have the terms checked - you could pass in something with the url from the button in order to determine you should check off the terms - adding a &amp;termsChecked=true or something to the end of your url would surfice then from here you can go about this two ways (again - only if this button directs to your own site and not someone elses where you are attempting to automatically check off these boxes) first - using javascript on the front end. The code you posted above looks looks a lot like javascript, not vb. try setting a function to run onload (window.onload = yourOnLoadFunction();) - then in yourOnLoadFunction - use document.URL to retrieve the url - you can use indexOf and substring to get the value for it the boxes should be checked. If they should be checked you can use javascript to check off the boxes (document.getElementById('chkBoxName').checked = true;) remember - JS is case sensitive. two - you could do this on the vb side page load. Request.QueryString("termsChecked") will give you if the value of terms checked from the url - then if you could check them on server side using chkBoxName.checked = true;
really easy if you have access to the database where the tickets are being stored - create a new table and determine the columns you will need (like ticket number, chat user, message, etc- that's up to your setup) - from here you could use an iframe on the side of your page to display this page. create a new page for the frame - on load place previous chat messages in chat window and develop your function to save the messages to the database. you can force a refresh of the frame pretty easily googling some javascript on a timer. as far as the no experience with mySql, best way to learn is dive right in. it won't be so bad since you are just creating a few insert and select statements.
I want to understanding something, your teacher has assigned you a program to write for a health care organization. What country are you in? **Bone**
I was able to pull data from the ROM and assign it to a string earlier, but I think the problem now is the encoding method of the file. the closest I got to usable data was a string of chinese characters in the text box i showed the string in. I was using BigEndedUnicode. All the others aside from Unicode came up blank or with random symbols.
Oh we're in America. It's not quite a health care organization. It's just a support resource for students in this college we're in.
I'll give it a shot when I get the chance, thanks!
For Binary Data, use the BinaryReader and BinaryWriter classes. That way you can manipulate the file at a byte-level rather than character level. 
Thanks a bunch!
How did you make the calendar?
I just dragged it in from the toolbox
I actually figured it out. Thank you for the reply though!
Shouldn't myvalue be myvalue = int((islides * Rnd) + 1) to ensure that every slide is being "evenly" shuffled? The current expression makes earlier slides more likely to end up near the beginning again, since their original count is a factor in their new count.
Yeap! The code is flawed. Personally, the way I would approach it is: Dim indexList as New List(of Integer) For n = 1 to islides indexList.Add(n) Next For i = 1 To ActivePresentation.Slides.Count Dim roll as Integer = Int(Rnd * indexList.Count) + 1 myvalue = indexList(roll) indexList.RemoveAt(roll) ActiveWindow.ViewType = ppViewSlideSorter ActivePresentation.Slides(myvalue).Select ActiveWindow.Selection.Cut ActivePresentation.Slides(islides - 1).Select ActiveWindow.View.Paste Next Basically, I have a List of integers that run from 1 to islides. When I need a random number, I'll pull a random number out of the list and then delete it from the list, ensuring that I'll never pick the same number again. It's quick and dirty and gets the job done.
The whole point of calling a function is because you are interested in the return value of said function. If you only want to do some stuff, you should just call a Sub. Your function CalcTotal returns a decimal as return value, but you aren't doing anything with it Dim tax as Double Dim grandTotal as Decimal Dim total as Decimal total = CalcTotal(tax, grandTotal) There you have, now you are saving the return value from CalcTotal into the variable total Hope this gives you a hint. If you have any questions just ask 
function parameters are order-sensitive. if you declare tax-first, you have call it tax-first. they don't know or care what your passed variable names are. 
while i agree, this is an assignment, and it's a good way to teach ByRef even if it's not how you'd ever do it in the real world. 
"help" implies you're doing the work, so show us what you've got so far, and ask a more specific question about you're having an issue with.
you could use simple arrays for this - one to hold the riddles and one for the solutions, making sure when you enter the riddles and solutions into the arrays that the index matches so you get the correct answers.
This really helps a lot. As I said I felt like I was really over thinking the whole thing. Thank you!
I totally missed the ByRef portion of the code Btw why would you want to use a Ref in a function?
Oh you're right, guess I was thinking it too simple
using qpc, 100 nanoseconds resolution, but there's generally 1 microsecond overhead per request, but this will all vary based on CPU brand and model and speed. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn553408%28v=vs.85%29.aspx windows isn't a real time OS, so there's no guarantees of any minimum resolution.
I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to do here. Why are you using a timer? What executes in the timer routine? Are you trying to get the time between events? Why do you need it in nanoseconds? What else happens in the code before you switch it? I'm just trying to figure out what your ultimate goal is because there may be a better solution than using a timer. I really have no idea what you're trying to do besides change a variable on every loop and if that's the case, the speed at which you can do that will depend entirely on what else is in the loop and the speed of your processor. With a while loop my cpu can do 520,000,000 calculations of (x * -1) per second which is about 2 nanoseconds and that's purely flipping a variable. Anything else on top of that is going to add time.
What I am trying to do is send a signal to a DAC card where the variable is a voltage for the output. The timer's function is to put a delay between flipping the voltage. The timer function above is the one built in to VB2010. The DAC has it's own limitations. Which I know. I am basically trying to send a square wave down and this is the code to do it. There is a special function that the DAC uses. The smaller the pulse width the more accurate my results can be. There may be a better way to do it than what I have attempted here. I am just not sure. I basically have it such that a button press will start the while loop. 
Thanks for the reply. That is a good link and I am reading through it now. 
I'm not sure if these are noob questions but: What i'm trying to do is make an alternate media player like windows media player, but not windows media player because its UI is shit. Normally id make the program in java, but I wanna have it running almost 24/7 and I don't think java would be a good choice for that. * I'm trying to do something similar to windows media player's or itune's toolbar on the start menu. I have no idea how to do that. * I'm also trying to get the program to work the same way as WMP/itunes when it comes to the computer's media controls. I have built in media controls on my laptop and they work with itunes &amp; WMP. I know there's some way to get the play/pause media control because I've bound it to another key through a .NET application that can recognize the key. Other than that I can pretty much google most other things I need.
So you're trying to do is this? do wait x time flip variable send signal loop And do it at the speed of nanoseconds? Unless you have some godlike processor you won't get it down to 1 nanosecond so you can probably take out the timer. Start this process in a new thread so the application doesn't freeze and just have a loop go as fast as it possibly can. Doing that is most likely going to peg one of your cores at 100% while it runs but is going to send it as fast as your computer can run. If the timer is there because the DAQ can't handle signals that fast and you want it somewhere between the limit of your cpu and 1ms then you could always use Dim span as New System.Timespan(1) Thread.Sleep(span) Timespan is in intervals of 100nanoseconds so 10x more precise than the built in timer. If you want to get between 2 and 100 you would have to do it as fast as it can and only send every x iterations where the final outcome is the limit of the DAQ card. (Say your computer can do 600M/s but the card can only take 150M/s you could send every 4th loop)
Thank you for this. I realize 1ns is way to much to ask but anything close should be acceptable. I think 100ns might work. I will try and build it tomorrow and report back. Thanks for all the extremly helpful insight. I really do apprciate the time and effort. 
you can use the like operator to handle this. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/swf8kaxw.aspx
The like operator returns true/false. I need to be able to find the match and extract it. Examples: C0002, F0232-556 and they can be anywhere in the string.
The pattern would be something like ([A-Z][0-9]{4}(-[0-9]{3})?)
Try ([A-z][1-9-]@)
No worky: http://www.regexr.com/. Btw, if it matters, this will be used in VB.NET. using a regex match function.
Are the numbers always the same length? This ([A-z])([0-9-]{1,10}) matched A01010 A01010-1234 on that webpage. That webpage also doesn't seem to interpret @ the way that VBA does, so I don't know if it will work. NB: it also matched l- in "ctrl-z" if your strings are always 6 or 10 numbers than you could write ([A-z])([0-9-]{6,10}) 
Doesn't match for me: http://imgur.com/xPlW7FC Also, there will always be: 1 letter + 4 numbers OR 1 letter + 4 numbers + dash + 3 numbers
Works for me. Maybe you can see a typo I'm missing. http://imgur.com/9q0WF3n
I think i see the problem. You don't have the global search flag, so it quits after finding V2
You are using 5 numbers after the letter and 4 numbers after the dash. Should be A1234-123 or A1234.
findReplacePattern doens't seem to be a built in function, or at least google isn't finding the docs for it. 
yeah sorry its not. I didn't write it, so I don't know much about it. I'm not a programmer and have been pretty much using it as a black box for find and replace Sub findReplacePattern(findStr As String, repStr As String) ClearFindAndReplaceParameters turnOnTrackRevisions = False If ActiveDocument.TrackRevisions = True Then turnOnTrackRevisions = True End If Selection.WholeStory Selection.HomeKey Break = False i = 0 Do ActiveDocument.TrackRevisions = False With Selection.Find .ClearFormatting .Replacement.ClearFormatting .Text = findStr .Replacement.Text = repStr .MatchCase = False .MatchWholeWord = False .MatchWildcards = True .Wrap = wdFindContinue End With If Selection.Find.Execute = True Then If Selection.Text = "" Then MsgBox "Warning: Pattern """ &amp; findStr &amp; """ matched empty string, this is a probable bug - skipping this find/replace and continuing." Break = True End If If i &gt; 10000 Then MsgBox "Warning: possible inifite loop for pattern """ &amp; findStr &amp; """ - skipping this find/replace and continuing." Break = True End If If Break = False Then Selection.Find.Execute Replace:=wdReplaceOne tStr = Selection.Text ActiveDocument.Undo If turnOnTrackRevisions Then ActiveDocument.TrackRevisions = True End If Selection.TypeText tStr i = i + 1 End If Else Break = True End If Loop Until Break If turnOnTrackRevisions Then ActiveDocument.TrackRevisions = True End If ClearFindAndReplaceParameters End Sub
Thanks again for your help. I resolved my issue by doing a first pass of the string in vb and removing errant dashes that might throw off the regex. 
ah, yeah this method isn't going to let you do a callback. it's a wildcard find with a plain replace. you'd have to do quite a lot of work in the "If Break = False Then" block to add detection of the \1 callback and then read the current match and apply a formula somehow...
I'm actually pretty interested in learning this stuff. This method does cause me quite a few problems, so I planned on really diving into it once I ran into a problem. Do you have any suggestions for where I should look for the solution? I don't even really know what to google. The problem I have is that I've learned the basics of like 4 or 5 programming languages, but its all been self taught just to solve one or two problems. 
this might be a good start http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff836618(v=office.15).aspx
I've not used string.empty, but I know "" isn't the same as " ". Either way, you already have an If to validate the input, you just need to modify or enhance it to include other conditions. You could TRIM() it first, or you could even check if it's a number before doing anything, that would probably be best. 
Yeah my professor just taught us today in class how to use TRIM(), but this is homework from the previous class. Oh well, I could still use TRIM() anyway. As long as it works. Thanks for your feedback!
The first thing to do is subclass the textbox to accept only numeric values. I have used this code from Microsoft and extended it for other numeric types: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229644%28v=vs.80%29.aspx The best way to check and see if there is any text in the textbox is using the Length property. In your case: If milesDrivenTextBox.Length &lt;&gt; 0 Then 
I would suggest just downloading [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/ ). But if you want to download [IE11](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/internet-explorer-11-details.aspx) 
I'm using Chrome. I meant the webbrowser tool. It uses IE 7 which is not compitable with a lot of things. I've got 11 installed but still..
Ah... sorry. I didn't read the full context. Good luck!
You have to change one of a couple of things to get it working correctly. This should get you pointed in the right direction: http://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2011/May/21/Web-Browser-Control-Specifying-the-IE-Version
I can confirm this works. even for vb6 applications. 
You're the MVP! Works perfectly (so far). Thanks a lot!
That's okay, thanks for trying to help me though.
Glad I could help!
The problem there is if you have A12345 it will throw a true on A1234. It's been a while since I had to look into regex, you might try regex101.com
yep, but op didnt specify any delimiters, just strings containing sequences
Acquaint yourself with Double.TryParse then you'll be good to go
I'm not entirely sure what we should be looking at here. Did you need help, or are you just showing us something you're working on? If it's the latter, what exactly are we supposed to be looking at?
Trying to find a good script to save/load the value and tries.
I've got a few questions. Why are you determining if a text string is greater than another text string? Why are you using WarningValue.Text instead of a True/False boolean variable?
 Public Class Form1 Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load 'Form Load Event RadioButton1.Tag = 0 RadioButton2.Tag = 1 RadioButton3.Tag = 2 RadioButton4.Tag = 3 RadioButton5.Tag = 4 RadioButton6.Tag = 5 RadioButton7.Tag = 6 RadioButton8.Tag = 7 RadioButton9.Tag = 8 RadioButton10.Tag = 9 End Sub Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click If RadioButton1.Checked Then TextBox1.Text = Val(Val(10 * RadioButton1.Tag) + Val(GroupBox2) * Val(GroupBox3)) - Val(GroupBox4) * Val(Val(10 * RadioButton1.Tag) + Val(GroupBox2) * Val(GroupBox3)) End If End Sub End Class I was just making it easier to read and getting rid of unnecessary stuff I'm not sure what you're trying to do here. Are there multiple groupboxes and inside each one are multiple radio buttons? And are you trying to get the value of the selected radio button inside each groupbox?
I just wanted to report back that due to help in this thread I was able to resolve my issue and things are working brilliantly. Special thanks to /u/Thukoci for all of his help.
Yeah, that is what I have to do. I have four group boxes and in each one is a radio button that has a different value tagged to it. I have to write the code for that equation, but I don't know how to get it to take the values of the radio buttons in each group box. 
Alright, I shall try this and let you know how it turns out! Thank you a ton!
It all depends on how clean you want your code. This is another solution. You would use this one by calling GBSelected. It's a much cleaner solution and this is all the code you'd need for all of the boxes but not something a teacher would be expecting if you're doing it for a class. Label1.Text= GBSelected(Groupbox1.Controls) Private Function GBSelected(controlItem As Control.ControlCollection) For Each radio As RadioButton In controlItem If radio.Checked = True Then Return radio.Tag End If Next Return Nothing End Function http://imgur.com/a/9OHMd
Do you need help with anything? I see in a previous post you said you were trying to find something to save/load the values. What you have currently does do that but what are you trying to find out? Or what can we help with?
Yeah. Whenever I save to the file it adds to the text file, not overwriting the whole file. 
Oh, that's easy. In your My.Computer.FileSystem.WriteAllText("C:/Val.txt", Label2.Text, True) Just change the last True to False. It's for appending. If you want it to overwrite every time change it to False so it doesn't append to the file.
Oh. Thank you. I'm not too advanced in Visual Basic, so I don't know everything about it. 
Not a problem. I just couldn't figure out exactly what you wanted. If you need any more help just post again. Be a little more specific with the problem and help will be much faster.
Okay. 
If you're using Private Function GB1Selected() For Each radio As RadioButton In GroupBox1.Controls If radio.Checked = True Then Return radio.Tag End If Next Return Nothing End Function Then you'll need one for each groupbox and you just put GB1Selected() in there where you want the value of the selected radio in the groupbox. Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click TextBox1.Text = Val(Val(10 * GB1Selected()) + Val(GB2Selected()) * Val(GB3Selected())) - Val(GB4Selected()) * Val(Val(10 * GB1Selected()) + Val(GB2Selected()) * Val(GB1Selected())) End Sub
and by tagging the radio buttons I have given them a number value?
I just assumed they already had tag values because they were listed in the original code. But yes, that is the value it is returning.
It worked! I think my values are off, but at least it calculated something! So basically to get it to take the value of the radio button, you just have to do "GB#Selected" ? 
It worked! I think my values are off, but at least it calculated something! So basically to get it to take the value of the radio button, you just have to do "GB#Selected" ? 
Its something I'm trying to make for another class. RadioButton1.Tag = 0 RadioButton2.Tag = 1 RadioButton3.Tag = 2 RadioButton4.Tag = 3 RadioButton5.Tag = 4 RadioButton6.Tag = 5 RadioButton7.Tag = 6 RadioButton8.Tag = 7 RadioButton9.Tag = 8 RadioButton10.Tag = 9 RadioButton11.Tag = 0 RadioButton12.Tag = 1 RadioButton13.Tag = 2 RadioButton14.Tag = 3 RadioButton15.Tag = 4 RadioButton16.Tag = 5 RadioButton17.Tag = 6 RadioButton18.Tag = 7 RadioButton19.Tag = 8 RadioButton20.Tag = 9 those are the values I have so far. So the example I have is radiobutton 3 radiobutton 11 radiobutton 26 and radiobutton 35 are all checked and radio button 26 is taged as 3 and radiobutton 35 is tagged as 0.10 for 10% so textbox1.text has to = Minimum Resistance = Nominal Resistance - (Resistor Tolerance x Nominal Resistance) and textbox2.text = Nominal Resistance = ( (10 *digit1) + digit2 ) x 10digit3. so yeah haha I dont think I should post all of my code just in case, its just I haven't heard from my instructor in four days and I need help... 
You can send me a PM of the whole code if you don't want to post it int a public forum.
math.pow(x,y) is the power function. It will give you a number to the power of the other number so math.pow(2,5) = 2^5 = 32
Thanks man! I've figured that something is just screwy with the order of operations.
what line is the error on? if what you're finding doesn't exist, I'm not sure what will happen. does the find repeat or give an error?
this is vba right? is there an Option Explicit at the top of the module? if so you need to DIM Break somewhere. that's the only think i can think of.
Sorry, I got busy and couldn't get back to you. Do you still need help getting the numeric-only textbox working or have you moved on?
I don't see Option Explicit anywhere. The routine I copied this loop structure from didn't explicitly declare Break and its in the same module (project? I don't know what the correct word is). I added Dim Break As Boolean anyway. It still gives the same error and identifies the Sub Main() as the location of the error.
Option Explicit mean that you must declare all variables. without it, you don't, and that can cause some interesting bugs... but not this one. I don't see anything obviously wrong, so maybe the issue is somewhere else in the module. you really need to pinpoint what line is causing it. 
Do you need to build the database yourself? Do you know what you're going to use for the database? For a simple project like this you should build the majority of the form first and do event driven programming. You should start building it as far as you can get and ask specific questions, there are a lot of things that could go wrong here and we don't know where you're stuck or what you know. Start anywhere you want, I'd start with the form and then later you can figure out how to connect to the database, populate the list boxes and/or combo boxes, find out what is selected, do the math, etc.
Hi. The database I've builded is pretty simple. One database for all of the information, but specific tables for various parts. tblCustomerDetails, tblEmployeeDetails, tblStockPrices, etc. Yeah, I was considering just designing it all first and completing the forms that I knew before getting onto the complex stuff. The only form I was stuck on was the guitar customisation form, I know the code for the rest of the program. I tried to be as specific as possible but I'll bear that in mind next time. 
Give the labels IDs? 
The easiest way, I think, would be to create a custom class and either have it inherit the label class or make the label a property of your object. Within your custom class you can define an x and y property that you can use to find the cell in question. I'm outside now so I can't show you a code sample but if you familiarise yourself with objects orientated programming it is quite trivial. 
You could add each new label to a List(of Label), and then reference them by index.
Try using a try catch block around the code and if an error is caught have it spawn a message box.
Yea, but I don't know how to incorporated that into VSE itself! I was about to add that link to the OP, but you broke the ice. EDIT: I don't know how to do an http get request through VSE.
Something like this Try Answer = 10/0 Catch ex as Exception msgbox("Can't devide by zero") End Try
 Dim web As New Net.WebClient() Dim src As String = web.DownloadString(link) src will now have the returned data Judging by the api you will need to format it like this &lt;host&gt; "/api/d3/profile/" &lt;battletag-name&gt; "-" &lt;battletag-code&gt; "/hero/" &lt;hero-id&gt; So Dim Link as String = "us.battle.net/api/d3/profile/" + txtBattleTag.Text + "/hero/" + txtHeroId.txt You just need to deserialize the JSON it and you're golden.
Fantastic, thank you so much - I'll take a look after dinner :) Have a nice evening.
It should just go through normally if it works, no exception will be caught and it will proceed as normal. Inside the try catch block should be all the code up to an including all calculations if no exception is caught. Or add and If statement if an error is caught. Basically what it does is if there's an error it will exit the code and go right to the catch point. Dim Num as Integer Dim Denom As Integer Dim Answer as Integer Dim error as Boolean Try Answer = Num / Denom Catch ex as Exception msgbox("Error") error = true End Try If error = False then Answer *= 5 If Answer &gt; 10 then Answer /= 3 Else Answer *=2 End If For i as Integer = 1 to 20 Answer += i*Num Next End If 
Can you post your code?
Evening :P It's not even noon yet
 If time = CET then MsgBox("Have a nice evening.") End if If time = CET - 6 then MsgBox("Have a nice afternoon.") End if If time = CET - 12 then MsgBox("Have a nice day.") End if 
Add http:// in front of it. The test I used is this Dim hp As Integer Dim Battletag As String = "Slayer-1182" Dim HeroID As String = "1930884" Dim Link As String = "http://us.battle.net/api/d3/profile/" + Battletag + "/hero/" + HeroID Dim web As New Net.WebClient() Dim src As String = web.DownloadString(Link) Dim CharStats As Dictionary(Of String, Object) = New JavaScriptSerializer().Deserialize(Of Object)(src) hp = CharStats("stats")("life")
Great help :) Thanks a lot.
Nothing wrong with the idea man +1 for fun.
 [Scope] Sub foo(arg1 as X, arg2 as Y...) .. dostuff .. End Sub Basically the difference between subs and functions are that functions return a value and a sub doesn't
thanks 
so is this correct: Module Module1 Sub Main() Dim L, W, H As Integer Dim n As Integer Console.Write("Enter Length:") L = Console.ReadLine Console.Write("Enter Width:") W = Console.ReadLine Console.Write("Enter Height:") H = Console.ReadLine Vl(L, W, H) End Sub Sub Vl(ByVal L As Integer, ByVal W As Integer, ByVal H As Integer) Dim S As Integer S = L * W * H Console.WriteLine("The volume of the object is {0} cubic units", S) End Sub End Module
That is correct. See that you can also write the same thing but using a Function: Module Module1 Sub Main() Dim L, W, H As Integer Dim n As Integer Console.Write("Enter Length:") L = Console.ReadLine Console.Write("Enter Width:") W = Console.ReadLine Console.Write("Enter Height:") H = Console.ReadLine Console.Write(Vl(L, W, H)) End Sub Function Vl(ByVal L As Integer, ByVal W As Integer, ByVal H As Integer) as String Dim S As Integer S = L * W * H Return S.toString End Sub End Module
When you say another "folder", do mean it's in another Project? If so, each project is a stand alone application, or library. You'll have to add a reference to the other project. If you can see one direction, but not the other, then I'd guess you have a reference set up in the one that can see the other one, but not the other direction. 
You could add each value to a List(Of Integer) and with each creation of value check to see if it exists in the list and if it does, regenerate value. This would keep you from generating the same value more than once. Oh and you would probably want to check if the list contains all the possible numbers (ie, .Count) to ensure that the program doesn't get stuck in an endless loop trying to find a number that isn't already in the list. 
I think you're looking for and Exit statement. Like this: If gallonsUsedTextBox.Text = "0" Then 'comment these lines out as necessary gallonsUsedTextBox.Text = "Value must be &gt; 0" 'comment these lines out as necessary Exit Sub Edit! Meant Exit, not End... 
If textbox1.text="" doesn't work for you try going textbox1.text.length = 0 It is also less consuming for the computer to do that then comparing two strings
You could create a function that checks if any of them are blank or zero Private Function NoBlankOrZero() As Boolean If TextBox1.Text = "" Or TextBox1.Text = "0" Then Return False If TextBox2.Text = "" Or TextBox2.Text = "0" Then Return False If TextBox3.Text = "" Or TextBox3.Text = "0" Then Return False If TextBox4.Text = "" Or TextBox4.Text = "0" Then Return False If TextBox5.Text = "" Or TextBox5.Text = "0" Then Return False Return True End Function And then before the giant tower put If NoBlankOrZero then 'Tower Else msgbox("blank and zero entries not allowed") End If Speaking of the tower, what is it that the program does?
Thank you. This worked. Next time I'll always use this thanks a lot man.
My guess is that since you're a beginner you're either learning if statements or arrays so you can hard code the answers in. This is a great use of arrays. You define an array of length 11 and in each index you can put the roman numeral answer in. Dim Numerals() = {Nothing,"I","II","III", etc} Then you find out if the text input below 10 and if so then you return the Numerals array index of the input number If input is less than or equal to 10 then Label2.Text = Numerals(Input) You may also want to check if the input is numeric and not letters 
I don't get it though - how will this know what roman numeral to output though? I see the roman numeral that you showed in the code, but where are the actual #s - 1,2,3, 4, etc?
The actual numbers? Maybe I should start with this. Have you used a Select Case statement yet? Or know how they work? If not, I can explain. It starts with "Select Case" and then you put the variable that you're checking. In this instance it's "Input". Each "Case &lt;object&gt;" is checking whether or not the variable in the original statement meets the condition of the case. So Case 1 is asking if Input = 1. If it does then it executes the code within, in this case telling the label text to be set to "I" which is the roman numeral equivalent. You can go through as many cases as you desire, continually adding more scenarios where the case may be true. Case Else at the end means that if none of the other cases were true then it executes this code. It is by no means necessary but it lets the user know that their input was not valid. If you want to define all of the roman numerals ahead of time you can do so above the Select statement Dim RomanOne as String = "I" Dim RomanTwo as String = "II" Dim RomanThree as String = "III" And then instead of putting Label1.Text = "I" you can put Label1.Text = RomanOne
 you've really been a great help man! Thanks alot! EDIT: What dos the S.toString do? i haven't encountered that yet.
perfect, thanks. I know you could have easily ignored this question(s) , but I appreciate your help. ill end with this though - when declaring variables, I thought you have to name them based on the variable? so for example, if its a string, wouldn't it be Dim strRomanOne as String? why is it just romanone as string? why not the 'str' prefix in front? Also, based on what you wrote in your last 2 responses, would you mind helping me get started by writing how the select case would look like for the first 4 numbers - including the declared variables and the actual select case code that will turn the values into the roman numerals.
sorry man, i'am a .net noob, so what you are saying to me is nonsense, at least for now. again, I AM REALLY SORY AND THANKS FOR THE EXPLENATION
A variable can be named anything with alpha-numeric symbols as long as it doesn't start with a number. Putting 'str', 'int', 'dbl' in front isn't necessary but, yes, it does help you remember what type it is. Personally if I use a variable less than a few times I don't bother with prefixing it with anything, just a personal(and probably not widely accepted) naming convention. I can help with putting it together, sure. I'd just normally post the whole answer and that would be that but since you're learning I want to see what you come up with and your process first. Between the two posts you can extrapolate pretty much the full code. Me posting it wouldn't help you besides just finish this assignment. You should declare your variables first and then do the select case statement for all outcomes you expect. If you post the code you come up with I can give you some help as to what is wrong.
Haha don't apologize for not knowing stuff :P I'll explain a little further with an example. If you have an integer S an you do S.toString it returns the value from S in a string i.e.: Dim S as Integer S = 1 + 1 S.toString 'Here it returns the string "2" so you can use it as text You can try this with different types of data: Dim S as Integer(2) 'I declare S as an array of integers of size 2 S(0) = 1 S(1) = 3 S.toString 'Returns the string "1,3" I'll leave you the [Object.ToString Method MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.object.tostring%28v=vs.110%29.aspx). Give it a look and ask if you have any more doubts
well I didn't want you to post it just so I can finish the assignment. I honestly wanted to learn in the process. but ill give it a shot : 'the Number is the name of the textbox &gt;Dim intNumber As Integer &gt;Dim RomanOne, RomanTwo, RomanThree, RomanFour, As String intNumber = Cint(txtNumber.Text) Select Case intNumber ...and here' where im stuck with the rest. probably not even right so far.
So far it looks good. But I think I know why you're stuck. Would I be right in saying that you can't figure out where I am getting "I" and "II" from? You think they're somewhere in the computer and you just have to code something to find them? Unfortunately you have to hardcode them all into the variables yourself. to post it looking like code, put 4 spaces in front of the line
May I jump in? You are right so far, let me add a little bit of code so you can finish it Dim intNumber As Integer, RomanOne As String = "I", RomanTwo As String = "II", RomanThree As String = "III", RomanFour As String = "IV" intNumber = Cint(txtNumber.Text) Select Case intNumber Case 1 'It means, when the input number is 1 txtRoman.Text = RomanOne Case 2 'When the input number is 2 txtRoman.Text = RomanTwo Case 3 .. Case 4 .. Case Else 'Always code the Else case in case the user inputs another number .. End Case
The select case do the trick. The line "Select Case intNumber" evaluates de value of intNumber and then proceed to compare that value against every Case you code until the End Case. You can think of a Select Case as a nested If: If intNumber = 1 Then txtRoman.Text = RomanOne ElseIf intNumber = 2 Then txtRoman.Text = RomanTwo ElseIf intNumber = 3 Then .. ElseIf intNumber = 4 Then .. Else .. End If
intNumber is defined up above intNumber = Cint(txtNumber.Text) That puts the text from txtNumber.Text into the varialbe intNumber When a variable is defined inside of a sub or function by using Dim it is available anywhere within the scope of the area where it is defined. If it is defined outside of a loop and at the start then it is available to everything inside the Subroutine. But if you were to define it inside of an if statement then it would only be available to code beneath it.
Here, I'll walk you through the code. Public StrRiddle(0 To 2) As String Public StrAnswer(0 To 2) As String Public Value As Integer This creates three variables: strRiddle(), which holds strings; strAnswer(), which also holds strings; and value, which holds integers. You can think of variables as empty boxes that can hold a particular type of data. Strings are alphanumeric characters, while integers are whole numbers. Why did I refer to strRiddle() with the brackets? That indicates that it's an **array**, or a variable that holds more than one value. Arrays are kinda like drawers that you subdivide into several compartments. Each compartment can hold its own value, but the entire drawer is still referred to by the name of strRiddle() or strAnswer(). When you want to access a particular compartment within the drawer, you use the **index** to refer to that compartment. Therefore, strRiddle(0) will refer to the first compartment (because we count arrays from 0, not 1), strRiddle(1) will refer to the second compartment and so on. When we declare the array as (0 to 2), we're telling the computer to split the drawer into 3 compartments with the indices of 0, 1, and 2. StrRiddle(0) = "I'm tall when I'm young and short when I'm old. What am I?" StrAnswer(0) = "A candle!" StrRiddle(1) = "How can a pants pocket be empty yet have something in it?" StrAnswer(1) = "It can have a hole in it!" StrRiddle(2) = "What goes up when rain comes down?" StrAnswer(2) = "Umbrellas!" What you're doing here is basically assigning values to the compartments within the drawers. I think this part is pretty straightforward, but if you don't understand anything here hit me up and I'll explain further. Otherwise let's move on. Value = Int(Rnd() * 3) Now, here we're rolling for a random number between 0 and 2. Whatever you multiply Rnd() by will always give you a number between 0 and that number - 1; therefore, if you wanted to simulate a standard die roll, you would write Int(Rnd()* 6) + 1 to give you a value of 1 to 6. MsgBox(StrRiddle(Value)) This shows the riddle at the random index you rolled in a message box; which, by the way, I should add is not always the best way to display content to your users. It works, but it's a very intrusive way of displaying information. Might be better to use a label or something else. Anyway. Unimportant. btnAnswer.Enabled = True This enables the answer button. MsgBox(StrAnswer(Value), 0 + 64, "Answer") This shows the answer when btnAnswer is clicked. The [0 + 64 setting](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/139z2azd.aspx) tells the program to also display only an OK button (0) as well as the Information icon (64). 
.toString basically converts any data into a string. You know that, most times, numbers are stored as integers, yeah? If you want it to be a string instead, you can use the .toString method to turn it into the string. The difference is this: Dim x as Integer = 5 Dim y as Integer = 2 Console.WriteLine(x + y) 'this gives you 7, as expected Console.WriteLine(x.toString + y.toString) 'this gives you 52 
thanks!
First off: Select Case Yr Case Yr 'One' This is kinda weird. What you're telling the computer is, if the value inside variable "Yr" (Select Case Yr) is equal to the value inside the variable "Yr" (Case Yr), then do whatever follows below this. I think you may be looking for this instead: Select Case Yr Case 1 Secondly, you're calling Readline into P twice without doing anything with it? P = Console.ReadLine i = 0.1 P = Console.ReadLine i = 0.2 I'm not sure what the point of this is. The code is overall somewhat confusing, I'm not sure what is it that you want to accomplish. Maybe you can explain what is it that you intend your code to do, and then we can help fix your code for you?
Holy crap- thank you. You have no idea how much that helped me. Seriously, thank you for that. 
Have you tried just taking out the last part? objSelection.Font.Name = "Calibri" objSelection.Font.Bold = False objSelection.Font.Size = "11" objSelection.Font.Color = RGB(0,0,0) objSelection.TypeText "Regards," objSelection.TypeText Chr(11) objSelection.TypeText strName Set objSelection = objDoc.Range() objSignatureEntries.Add "Reply Signature", objSelection objSignatureObject.ReplyMessageSignature = "Reply Signature" That's the only part where I see that so I would assume if you take that out then it wouldn't add it.
I actually ended up replacing that exact part with the entire top part for the "New Signature" and it seemed to have worked! The only issue is that in Outlook, when you go to the Signature settings, the New E-mail part isn't selecting the "New Signature", it just stays as "none". But when i create a new e-mail or reply/forward it does exactly what i was requesting :P Other than that i noticed my Outlook would freeze after i opened it? I'm going to continue testing this out with a few users before deploying by GPO. I guess we can consider this resolved :P Unless there's a way to define the entire first part by a value of some sort and just point to that for the second portion of the script? That's where i hit the brick wall and say "Hey, if it's not broke don't fix it" Here's the new script if anyone is interested: http://codeviewer.org/view/code:44bc
The moment you convert the text to an integer, a cast is being made, if the text in the box does not equal an integer, then you cause an error. When you backspace, the text in the box is now nothing, which does not correspond to any integer. I think there is a way to convert the text to an integer in such a way that it will not fail with an error. I haven't used this in a while, but what happens when you try cint(txtNumber.Text)? Oops, just tried it in VBA, and it throws a type mismatch. Search up convert string to integer in VB.NET. no time to search myself today. (or just wrap the text in a TRY CATCH FAIL block. if there is an error converting the text, you can recover by setting it to zero.) 
So here's what I put now: Dim intNumber As Integer intNumber = CInt(txtNumber.Text) If intNumber = 1 Then lblResult.Text = "I" End If Try Dim intNumber As Integer intNumber = CInt(txtNumber.Text) If intNumber = 1 Then lblResult.Text = "I" End If - I get an error saying that the variable 'intNumber' hides a variable in an enclosing block 
so I understand that it is crashing because it expected an entry into the textbox - which I then deleted / backspaced . how do I prevent that? in other words, how do I let the program know that if the entry is blank, not to do anything?
Make sure you clicked on Windows Form Application when you start a new project. I'm not sure if VS 2013 shows the designer by default, but if not you can View &gt; Designer. Otherwise, you could download Visual Studio 2010 express if you can't get use to the changes. I know this is a rather late reply, sorry. Hope this helped.
Are you under the Visual Basic templates? I believe it starts on Visual C++ by default, no idea if this is true, but this might be the case. Edit: It might also only be on the 'Visual Studio Express for Windows Desktop' version. I have no idea, never used the product.
The basic syntex for properties of a control is Form.Control.Property in your case you can skip the form unless you are looking up the value from another form. So you want somthing like this. Dim Message as string Message = "Welcome, " &amp; txtfirst.text &amp; " " &amp; txtLast.text &amp; " to, VB!" msgbox(message,vbokonly) The second part you would use the [MID](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/05e63829.aspx) function Public function RetPartString(txtstring as string, txtStart as string,txtEnd as string) as string Dim ReturnString as string = "" Dim StartInt as integer = cint(txtStart) Dim Length as Integer = Cint(txtEnd) - cint(txtStart) ReturnString = mid(txtstring,StartInt,Length) Return ReturnString End Function you would call this function from your button like this; txtResult.text = RetPartString(txtString,txtStart,txtEnd) I hope this helps. **Bone** 
Assuming they type the first &amp; last name into textbox1... TextBox2.Text = Split(Trim(TextBox1.Text), " ")(0) 'first name TextBox3.Text = Split(Trim(TextBox1.Text), " ")(1) 'last name Trim cleans up the first and last name, then split makes an array delimited by the space between the names, then you just reference the array elements.
Thank you but I am now getting an issue with separating the names. I am able to separate them but need to create an error should a last name not be entered. My code for the section in question is intspace = strFullName.IndexOf(" ") strFirst = strFullName.Substring(0, intspace) strLast = strFullName.Substring(intspace).Trim the problem is that once the program reaches strFirst = strFullName.Substring(0, intspace) It crashes because the length of intspace is less than zero unless a last name is entered. is there a way that I could add an if statement for if inspace is less than zero?
You always need to check the return values. IndexOf returns -1 if the string was not found. You need to check for that and do the appropriate action. And you can trim both names after the substring call like you are doing for the last name. This should take care of any leading or trailing spaces.
yourimage.move() ? this isn't a clear question.
Does your form have a 'Submit' button or something or are you expecting the conversion to happen immediately after text input?
I also tried For Each Str In abrFound If Str.Contains(Selection.Find) Then ActiveDocument.Comments.Add Range:=Selection.Range, Text:="review this" Break = True Else abrFound.Add Selection.Find End If Next and I get Argument not optional for the Str in abrFound
What version of VB are you using?
It's VBA. I launch it from Word 2010 if that makes a difference. I have noticed that a lot of syntax I see online doesn't seem to work for example Dim myStr As String = "test" it won't let me define the variable when I dim it, which I see all the time in the code I see online.
For VBA specific questions, I'd recommend /r/vba. The syntax you're using is correct vb.net syntax, but won't work in VBA
ahh thanks I didn't realize there was a separate subreddit for vba
Yeah. VBA and VB 6.0 (released 1998) are very similar in language. While VBA has maintained that language use for backwards compatibility, newer versions of VB have switched to .net, and work almost completely different. Posting in either subreddit will work fine, you just have to make sure you specify what compiler/interpreter version you're working with.
Sorry, I was a tad rushed at the time of writing. What I'm trying to do is make an image box move when I hold down a key. I do know that it can be done using a KeyDown event and a timer, but I'm not sure how.
on keydown, enable timer, timer calls .move, in keyup disable timer. 
 Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Dim a, b As Integer If Not IsNumeric(TextBox1.Text) Then MsgBox("Enter Numbers Only.") Return End If If Val(TextBox1.Text) &lt; 2 Or Val(TextBox1.Text) &gt; 9999999 Then MsgBox("Out of Range") Else If IsNumeric(TextBox1.Text) And Val(TextBox1.Text) &gt;= 2 Or Val(TextBox1.Text) &lt;= 9999999 Then a = Val(TextBox1.Text) b = 0 For c = (a - 1) To 2 Step -1 If a Mod c = 0 Then b = b + 1 End If Next c If b &gt;= 1 Then MsgBox(a &amp; " Is not a prime number") Exit Sub Else MsgBox(a &amp; " Is a prime number") End If End If Exit Sub End Sub End Class
That's what I have. I get what you mean by one may be inside the other, but I can't seem to get it out. 
Ah I see the problem. If Val(TextBox1.Text) &lt; 2 Or Val(TextBox1.Text) &gt; 9999999 Then MsgBox("Out of Range") Else If IsNumeric(TextBox1.Text) And Val(TextBox1.Text) &gt;= 2 Or Val(TextBox1.Text) &lt;= 9999999 Then The first if statement is valid the way it is on a single line. If you want multiple lines to execute if something fails then you need to make the if statement enclose the other one. If Val(TextBox1.Text) &lt; 2 Or Val(TextBox1.Text) &gt; 9999999 Then MsgBox("Out of Range") Else If IsNumeric(TextBox1.Text) And Val(TextBox1.Text) &gt;= 2 Or Val(TextBox1.Text) &lt;= 9999999 Then a = Val(TextBox1.Text) b = 0 For c = (a - 1) To 2 Step -1 If a Mod c = 0 Then b = b + 1 End If Next c If b &gt;= 1 Then MsgBox(a &amp; " Is not a prime number") Exit Sub Else MsgBox(a &amp; " Is a prime number") End If End If End If End Sub 
What error are you getting?
No error, its not increasing the count when I enter the integer. My friend briefly looked at it before work and said there might be a logical error at the end of the loop but I can't seem to find it.
I'd like to know what the program does as well. 
What do you mean by count? Could you tell me which variable count is?
&gt; Do WHile inputNumber &lt;&gt; string.empty but even that doens't make sense because it'll be an endless loop since inputNumber is never changed in the loop and there's no other break condition.
If something should be incrementing, you should probably be using Static instead of Dim. Edit: disregard. That's not the problem.
The input box line needs to be copied to within the loop.
What you just recommended was the problem. copying the input box line into the loop made the problem stop the infinite loop and made it work properly. Thank you so much.
What does Listbox2 contain?
It contains the code for the batch file that is executed. It's a basic take ownership script.
The hosts file cannot be edited without first taking ownership of it, which requires the bat file.
Don't use "Shell". Use Process.Start and you can specify a timeout on the .Start. This will wait for the process to end, or the timeout to occur, before returning to you. 
I'd mark the exe to run with admin privileges, and you won't need to take ownership. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163486.aspx#S8
Sweet! Did not know about this, thanks :)
Try the KeyPress event for txtFirst and txtSecond.
double clicking on the textboxes sets up the sub for when the text changes.. marry that with some sort of logic that fits your needs and you should be good
Why not add a line of code, maybe something memorable like a problem that you got hung up on or a favorite function

"If _vbTattoo IsNot Nothing then Regret(forEver) AndAlso Drink(aLot)" 
Assuming you're working with a form called form2 : Form2.close if you're done working with it. If you need to call it again you can use one of these two commands. Form2.Hide or me.Hide 
humorous and gives rise to other such ideas like those...
Although it's not VB and is way too long for a tattoo, [this](http://www0.us.ioccc.org/1990/westley.c) obfuscated code might give you an idea for something? Anyone who doesn't see it - it's a conversation between a man and woman.
Just to expand on this in case it gets interpreted as a static call: Dim theForm As New Form2 TheForm.Show ... TheForm.Close Or if you're placing the code within "Form2" &lt;code you run&gt; ... Me.Close
Seems like: dataGridView1.FirstDisplayedScrollingRowIndex = dataGridView1.Rows.count-1 May work OK. As for crashing, I'm not sure why without an error message. Do you get painting performance issues with DGVs? I do - so I double buffer them with this [code](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4255148/how-to-improve-painting-performance-of-datagridview). 
Thank you very much. Scrolling down doesn't seem to work, but that's probably because of the following: Apparently it's not crashing per se., it's just taking forever to add the new line (and if you click too much around during that, the program crashes). If you wait like 2 minutes before scrolling/clicking after the newest line was added, everything works fine (every line added afterwards too!). 
Sounds like the program may be stuck in some sort of super deep recursion or loop. Have you tried putting a break point in your code and then F8-ing through the code to see where it goes?
In btnCalc_Click you declare intRegisration and intLodging which sets them up with a value of nothing. You then add them up intTotal = intRegisration + intLodging or intTotal = nothing + nothing which gives you 0. Variables wont hold their values after the routines (including click events) have finished unless those variables are declared outside of the button click events or they are read from elsewhere on the form. (I.E. When you click calculate it could pull in the values you've already calculated in the previous steps. Do this by reading the data back from the list box lstCosts) or (Move 'Dim intRegisration As Integer' and 'Dim intLodging As Integer' to the top of the code. Then the variables will stay in memory as long as the form is open. is considered bad practice to keep variables always loaded though.)
You could read them in from the list on the form or you could replace the list with two text boxes txtRegistration and txtLodging which get populated when you click Add. When you hit Calculate, you then do intTotal = txtRegisration.value + txtLodging.value. That's how I would do it. To be honest loads of people leave variables floating about in open memory so it's not that bad, just try and keep them as a last resort or things can get crowded.
I think I can take it from here. Thank you so much for your help, you rock!!
I think you need to escape all of the braces that aren't format parameters, such as the ones after "body" and "background". Double quotes are the escape character to use Edit: might be wrong about double quotes as the escape character. It might be another brace instead, so {{ instead of "{
hem thats a thought let me look up the escape sequence.
You were dead on. There were 2 ways first way is using an escape result = String.Format("The text has {0} '{{' characters and {1} '}}' characters.", nOpen, nClose) the second and recomended way is to actually put in a parameter for the "{" result = String.Format("The text has {0} '{1}' characters and {2} '{3}' characters.",nOpen, "{", nClose, "}") Thanks man just was not thinking 
For those wondering here is the correct string tempstring = String.Format("{0}&lt;STYLE TYPE={1}text/css{2}&gt;{3}&lt;!-- {4}body {20}{5}width: 100%;{6}height: 100%;{7}margin: 0;{8}padding: 0;{9}overflow: hidden;{10}{21}{11}#background{20}{12}position:absolute;{13}height:100%;{14}width: 100%;{15}margin: 0;{16}padding: 0;{17}{21}{18}--&gt;{19}&lt;/STYLE&gt;", tempstring, Chr(34), Chr(34), cR, cR, tB, tB, tB, tB, tB, cR, cR, tB, tB, tB, tB, tB, cR, cR, cR, "{", "}") 
A Try-Catch would probably be what you're looking for. Try 'your code here Catch ex as System.Net.WebException 'what you should do when the exception is thrown Finally 'if there's any code that needs to be run after everything else End Try To run the ticker when the form runs, put your code in the Form.Load event.
Declaring VARIABLE as static means that its value will remain, well, static. The only way to change its value, therefore, is to do this: VARIABLE = 0 Alternatively, if you want VARIABLE to always be equal to 0 at the start of each button press, remove the static keyword and replace it with Dim instead, so that VARIABLE is created anew every time the Button.Click event fires.
First thing I would do is move the assignments that happen either way (for example label 9's text becomes label 5's text either way) out of the if structure to make it easier to read and get them out of your way. I would then just say "if b2 != b3 then" I don't believe you can access labels using label(yr).text unless you actually have an array of labels named label which I believe is a keyword. I don't know the correct way of doing this but I would use the .tag property to identify the labels by a numeric ID and then loop through the labels in your form and apply your changes that way. Just off the top of my head at 1am. I feel like you should probably have some kind of data structure handling the data and just be taking in the results from the form and relaying them back out after your function is called and that's why you have this weird (to me) label reading / searching / editing thing going on here. Something just seems odd about it. Either way best of luck and if you want to PM me more code I will look it over to try and help as best I can even though this comment wasn't very helpful.
Kind of leaning that way. Just not sure what yet, maybe something relating to the wife and kid. Thanks
Sorry for late reply. Just got back from school. Anyway, I did separate the labels now and I found out it was a very simple mistake of using Label as a keyword so I renamed everything to bel(yr).text which removes first error. I would be completely honest and say that when you started talking about .tag I didn't understand anything after that sorry. I think reading sample codes is much easier for me than a block of words. I appreciate the help. May if I add if you know a good tutorial for array looping in vb2010? Thanks again.
This seemed pretty simple for arrays: http://www.dotnetperls.com/array-vbnet .tag is another property of the label like .text and allows you to "tag" the label with information, think like a tag on a cow with a number. I was just suggesting you use that to keep track of which label is which. To be honest, don't worry about this entire block of text lol, just keep chugging along :) 
Oh thats an awesome idea. Was looking at a loop of my family members. But i like your idea!
on zero based array's, the upper bound key will be one less than the length. eg: 0,1,2 == length 3 
what vb version
2010 Express. Also the numeric values are decimals. so I would write "Dim as Decimal" Right?
How do I make an array?
What I would do is create 2 integers TotalT and TotalH Loop through the string using a For...Loop from 0 to the length of the string -1 If yourString(x) = "T" then TotalT += x+1 'because 0 is the first character if yourString(x) = "H" then TotalH += x+1 x being the iterator variable of your for...next loop. Display the result of TotalT and TotalH
No the iterator increments with each run of the loop until it finishes First run x = 0 but since 0 is the first character you need 0 + 1 if a "T" or "H" is found Second run x = 1 etc... For the same reason you had to -1 from the length you need to add 1 to the found index. Because the 1st character in a string is at index 0 you want the first character in the string to have a value of 1 so add 1 to the iterator which is already incrementing to get the result you want.
I think you should use 1 loop and an else if clause as a side note Dim tortoisIndexCount as integer = 0 Dim hairIndexCount as integer = 0 for i as integer = 0 to resultlength.count - 1 if results(i) = "T" then tortoiscount += 1 tortoisIndexCount += i else if results(i) = "H" then haircount += 1 hairIndexCount += i end if next Edit: oh, just had time to read your post, adding some code in for the indexes. If you want it to look visually correct you would add a 1 when you add i but if you want to use this to manipulate the string later I don't think you would want to do that. Just a thought
There is the code cleaned up, sorry about that.
this guide seems sane http://www.tutorialspoint.com/vb.net/vb.net_arrays.htm if you were using the msdn result that's the top of google results and stopped at the first example, I can see how you were confused. I find that one confusing too. 
'That is a real helpful link! Thank you! I still don't get the next step after I have. Dim intData() As Integer = {0.3, 0.5, 0.55} Dim names() As String = {"Bluegrass, Bermuda, Zoysia"} Dim miscData() As Object = {ComboBox1} Dim 0.55 As Decimal = Bluegrass 
 Dim intData() As Integer = {0.3, 0.5, 0.55} Dim names() As String = {"Bluegrass, Bermuda, Zoysia"} Dim miscData() As Object = {ComboBox1} Dim 0.55 As Decimal = Bluegrass 
There is the code in a better format.
You need to read the selected index Dim selection as integer Selection =combobox1.selectedindex 
.text is assumed on textboxes, not required.
There is a superfluous "&amp;" on Me.txtPasswordRegistration&amp; &amp;, possibly causing a typeast to a long, which fails (unless the password is numeric).
 Dim intData() As Integer = {0.3, 0.5, 0.55} Dim names() As String = {"Bluegrass, Bermuda, Zoysia"} So far, this is all correct. However, I think you're misunderstanding how an array works. The idea is that if the user selects index 0, you can plug 0 into both intData() and names() to get the same value of 0.3 and "Bluegrass". Therefore: Dim userInput as Integer = 0 'do whatever you need to get user input here Dim data as Integer = intData(userInput) Dim name as String = names(userInput) 
Thanks man! But /u/EkriirkE was right, that fucking superfluous &amp; was fucking my shit up, but thank you so so much for your input!
I did use a try catch, is there something i can do in the catch clause that will allow the user to re-enter their input?
You need to validate the input before running whatever routine uses that input, or exit the routine, leaving the existing correct data intact. The TextBox has a .Validating event that you can use to check it's content. You can set e.Cancel = True in that event to prevent the user from leaving the TextBox until the data is correct (you should display a label somewhere telling them what's invalid about the text). The other option is to exit the sub or function that needs valid info, and just return the user to the form. I think we'd need to see a bit of code to give you some solid direction here. 
Also check the path ... does DatabasePath contain a trailing "\", does the file exist ,etc. You could also create a temporary variable to hold the "image", and see if you can get it loaded (to see if the issue is on loading the image, or on setting it to the Graph.Image object).
I need it to display a message box if the user inputs a letter instead of a number or if they don't input anything at all. The problem I am Having is when I add more code to cover all 3 text boxes, I end up blocking out the mathematical function so it doesn't work even if a number is used.
 Dim selection As Decimal selection = ComboBox1.SelectedIndex Dim intData() As Decimal = {0.3, 0.5, 0.55} Dim names() As String = {"Bluegrass, Bermuda, Zoysia"} Dim miscData() As Object = {ComboBox1}
This gives a an answer, but it is always zero. Does that mean that this little bit of code is wrong? or is something else off?
I want to figure out how to get it to work first, then Ill worry about making it pretty haha. Though I wasn't aware of "math.Pi" 
At the beginning you're only checking the width but not the length. Right now if I put a number in the width and a letter in the length I get an error. You need to validate both the width and length before each block of rectangle code. You're not checking the radius at all, you'll want to validate that one before the circle code. Is this for a homework assignment, or do you just need help with a project?
If you use math.pi with a radius of anything other than 1 and you add, add, add, add then subtract, subtract, subtract, subtract you won't end up back at zero due to rounding errors. Unless you really need a number with 20 decimals of accuracy, using your magic number is probably going to be ok.
 Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click 'To add rectangle If Not IsNumeric(txtWidth.Text) Or Not IsNumeric(txtLength.Text) Then MsgBox("Enter Numbers Only.") If txtWidth.Text = "" Or txtLength.Text = "" Then MsgBox("Enter a Number") Return End If End If If RadioButton1.Checked And RadioButton3.Checked = True Then Form1.txtAreaSod.Text = Val(Me.txtWidth.Text * Me.txtLength.Text) + Val(Form1.txtAreaSod.Text) 'to subtract rectangle If Not IsNumeric(txtWidth.Text) Or Not IsNumeric(txtLength.Text) Then MsgBox("Enter Numbers Only.") If txtWidth.Text = "" Or txtLength.Text = "" Then MsgBox("Enter a Number") Return End If End If If IsNumeric(txtLength.Text) Then If RadioButton1.Checked And RadioButton4.Checked = True Then Form1.txtAreaSod.Text = Val(Form1.txtAreaSod.Text) - Val(Me.txtWidth.Text * Me.txtLength.Text) End If 'to add circle If Not IsNumeric(txtRadius.Text) Then MsgBox("Enter Numbers Only.") If txtRadius.Text = "" Then MsgBox("Enter a Number") Return End If End If If RadioButton2.Checked And RadioButton3.Checked = True Then Form1.txtAreaSod.Text = Val(3.1416 * Me.txtRadius.Text * Me.txtRadius.Text) + Val(Form1.txtAreaSod.Text) 'to subtract circle If Not IsNumeric(txtRadius.Text) Then MsgBox("Enter Numbers Only.") If txtRadius.Text = "" Then MsgBox("Enter a Number") Return End If End If If RadioButton2.Checked And RadioButton4.Checked = True Then Form1.txtAreaSod.Text = Val(Form1.txtAreaSod.Text) - Val(3.1416 * Me.txtRadius.Text * Me.txtRadius.Text) 
Also it is for school.
 Dim intData() As Integer = {0.3, 0.5, 0.55} Dim names() As String = {"Bluegrass, Bermuda, Zoysia"} Dim userInput As Integer = ComboBox1.SelectedIndex Dim data As Integer = intData(userInput) Dim name As String = names(userInput) 
Can you tell me just how to end one of the math if statements? Because when I put in "end if" it doesn't work either.
Do something like If it's a rectangle then If width and length text boxes are numbers then Do math Else Warn user End if Else (we know it's a circle because it's not a rectangle) If radius text box is a number then Do math Else Warn user End if End if That will fix the problems with it warning the user about the text boxes for the wrong shape being empty. 
Edit: im not trying to belittle you and this response is to the poster. No need for a string array. Only class variables. Take in each grade, convert to 1to4. Keep a running total of the sum and divide by number of classes. Do the problem on a piece of paper first.
Sure, but in a more general way, don't use Val() - you have no idea what the result will be. And don't embed constants in your code. Everybody knows what 3.1416 is, but one day you might have a magic number '9' in your code which represents (for instance) YourFavouriteTVSeries.CurrentSeason.EpisodeCount which will break when next year there are 10 episodes. Magic numbers are evil.
Basically what I need this app to do is calculate total salary from sales commissions and display the total salary amount as well as how many employees are in what salary range ($200 to over $999).

[finally got it.](http://i.imgur.com/Iu0a1sq.jpg) It was failing in all 3 timers -- but only sending errors in the last one. Once I added this Dispose command, it failed on Timer2. After adding it to Timer2, it failed on Timer1 until the image was disposed there. Super happy to have this working. Thx.
That works, but if I'm not wrong it doesn't autobind the alt-key combo outside of a menustrip: it just shows you a little underline. What your professor probably wants is for you to be able to jump from textbox to textbox through the use of an alt-key combo. For instance, to jump to txtSalvage, the user just has to press alt+S (for example), whereas to jump to txtLife, he has to press alt+L. I don't know if there's an easy way to do this, to be honest. Off the top of my head I'm thinking of using the [keypress event at a form level](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms171538.aspx), but that just seems overly complicated for a student assignment.
I stole this from a MS web site, but this the basic idea behind capturing alt-keycode combinations, if that's what you're actually supposed to be doing. Note that if you don't turn on keypreview for the form it doesn't work. Private Sub Form1_KeyDown(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs) Handles MyBase.KeyDown If e.Alt And e.KeyCode.ToString = "F" Then ' When the user presses both the 'ALT' key and 'F' key, ' KeyPreview is set to False, and a message appears. ' This message is only displayed when KeyPreview is set to True. MsgBox("KeyPreview is True, and this is from the FORM.") End If End Sub I imagine instead of showing a message you could set the focus to whichever text box they're trying to get to (Alt-F in the sample).
Yeah, it's the same code in the link I posted above. It works, but it seems overly complicated for an assignment unless it's &gt;= college level; and if it is, then the teacher surely must have gone over how to capture keypresses at a form level. I have a feeling that we may have misunderstood some part of OP's question or something.
Does the messagebox "Please select a rental type" show up?
Yeah, I think you're probably right. I haven't done textboxes in awhile in VB and figured that keypreview was a bit much for a student, hence why I was hoping the text label would work. But a little googling makes it seem like, indeed, it must be done at the keypress level.
Try If lstRentalType.SelectedIndex &lt;&gt; -1 Then If cboDays.SelectedIndex &lt;&gt; -1 Then If IsNumeric(cboDays.Text) Then ... Else MsgBox("Please select a rental type") End If
Ok that worked but now when I manually enter a number in the combo box it prompts me to select a a numeric number of days meaning this: If IsNumeric(cboDays.Text) Then Sees the input as string regardless. Here's how it looks like [now](http://pastebin.com/RV3HyDkh)
Your Else is in the wrong place. If lstRentalType.SelectedIndex &lt;&gt; -1 Then If cboDays.SelectedIndex &lt;&gt; -1 Then If IsNumeric(cboDays.Text) Then ... Else MsgBox("Please select a rental type") End If End If There's a reason why we write code with indentations: they tell us which level of a nested If-Else we're in. As you can see, your Else is on the level of "isNumeric", which means that it'll only show up when IsNumeric(cboDays.Text) returns false. What you want is this: If lstRentalType.SelectedIndex &lt;&gt; -1 Then If cboDays.SelectedIndex &lt;&gt; -1 Then If IsNumeric(cboDays.Text) Then ... Else 'do what needs to be done if isNumeric is false End If Else MsgBox("Please select a rental type") End If 
I figured it out guys. it's just putting &amp;Name and then using tabindexing with my labels and textboxes. Thanks to Calbearfan for pointing me in the right direction!
Quite timely, as I will be working on this assignment after work today. Don't ask me any questions, though. heh
Simple Code- Couple of ways to go about something like this. If the meal cost doesn't need to be displayed as it's input, I would just write the values to array then when calculated, add up all the arrays by looping thru it. If it does need to be displayed I would use something like a listbox or a listview with columns and recalculate as each is added.
Is this radio buttons or check boxes? 
Can I see a picture of your interface please? I am not understanding this layout as described. 
I thought about this for a while for I normally dont hand a solution out for homework, but I think in your case where the teacher is not available I am going to make an exception. I used a few diffrent techniques for storing values and placing them in the total box. 1) I used an old hack that stores the value of the option in the tag of each control. This saves having to have a seperate array that stores the values. 2) for the first 2 groups boxes I handled the event for each fo the controls with a single function (See at the end of the function the handles has more than 1 control listed 3) I used 2 diffrent methods to retrieve which items are added to the totals. The first checks each checkbox control to see if it is checked in the group box. If it is checked then I added the value stored in the tag for that control to the total for the burgers. I then called the function that added up all the values to place it in the total textbox The second uses the "Sender" value to retrieve the tag of the one selected in the group, and the last uses the event for each radio button to add the value when the radio buttun is pressed (this is the most common) A lot of this here is to introduce you to the fact that there is more than on way to solve a problem. **There is NO wrong way if your code works, only better ways** lastly I would like to say your teachers style completly sucks. I cant understand how a teacher could do that. Here is the [form](http://i.imgur.com/IgRuMqf.png) I created Here is the code I used Public Class Form1 Dim burgerTotal As Double = 0.0 Dim drinkTotal As Double = 0.0 Dim friesTotal As Double = 0.0 Private Sub CheckBox1_CheckedChanged(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles CheckBox1.CheckedChanged, CheckBox2.CheckedChanged, CheckBox3.CheckedChanged 'check to see if any of the check boxes have been checked and if it is add the value to the total Dim isChecked As Boolean = False Dim checkControl As CheckBox burgerTotal = 0.0 For Each checkControl In GroupBox1.Controls If checkControl.Checked = True Then isChecked = True burgerTotal = burgerTotal + checkControl.Tag End If Next txtTotal.Text = CheckTotals() GroupBox2.Visible = isChecked GroupBox3.Visible = isChecked End Sub 'Private Sub TxtTotal_TextChanged(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles txtTotal.TextChanged ' txtTotal.Text = String.Format(txtTotal.Text, "$#,##0.00") 'End Sub Private Function CheckTotals() As Double ' this function checks the form for what is checked and returns a total cost Dim total As Double = 0.0 total = burgerTotal + friesTotal + drinkTotal Return total End Function Private Sub RadioButton1_CheckedChanged(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles RadioButton1.CheckedChanged, RadioButton2.CheckedChanged, RadioButton3.CheckedChanged Dim checkRadio As RadioButton = sender friesTotal = CDbl(checkRadio.Tag) txtTotal.Text = CheckTotals() End Sub Private Sub RadioButton6_CheckedChanged(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles RadioButton6.CheckedChanged drinkTotal = CDbl(RadioButton6.Tag) txtTotal.Text = CheckTotals() End Sub Private Sub RadioButton5_CheckedChanged(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles RadioButton5.CheckedChanged drinkTotal = CDbl(RadioButton5.Tag) txtTotal.Text = CheckTotals() End Sub End Class 
You will need System.Net.WebClient or System.Net.Http.HttpClient to issue GET request against lolking.net (http://www.lolking.net/search?name=NameThatyouLookingFor&amp;region=RegionYouWillSearch) and HtmlAgilityPack (you can get it on NuGet) to parse received html. After that you can use xpath queries to get data you are interested in. Hope this helps 
Some interesting discussion going on over here that /u/Bonejob might want to read : http://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/2jb2bn/problem_with_nscc_instructor/cla47xm
Thanks for the info. 
What version do you have at school versus what is at home? Your home version looks like 2013.
You're awesome. I completely overlooked that, thanks. I changed the handler to form1.click and it sort of worked. I selected an option and if you click on the program anywhere it adds the text. I changed it then to form1.textchanged and no result. **The solution** I added the code to the combobox properties. Private Sub CmbBox1_SelectedIndexChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles CmbBox1.SelectedIndexChanged
I'm not sure why it's not reading it. Random things to try: Exclude the file and re-include it in the project (just right click -&gt; exclude from project) Maybe that will fix it. Copy paste your designer code &amp; your behind code to the new form and try moving the project the other way. Ensure that both copies of visual studio are the same version, if not save a project using the lower version and use that. You should be able to convert the lower project up if that is the case. I think something is wrong here, not just a simple version mismatch. It should use files from an older version fine. 
This did help, thanks
Using Dim heroes() As Object = CareerData("heroes") Will return the list of heroes. You can then use heroes.length to see how many characters they have and then use heroes(#) to refer to a specific one. It returns a dictionary so you can call individual each stat by name like you would a normal hero. Heroes(2)("name")
I'm sure this is not what you're looking for, but just in case: if you want to know the name of the form, you can just look at the properties window, which will have the name up top. Alternatively you can just rclick on the form and select "view code", and the name of the form will be up on the top next to the Class name. Other than that, I'm not sure what you mean by "show you what form you're looking at". If you're looking at a form, then the form that you're looking at is _surely_ the form that you're looking at? I mean, huh? 
Once again thank you :) I actually managed to call a specific hero around 2 hours after I posted, but was unable to find out the total so I could return all of them. Don't think I am being lazy by posting here, every resource regarding JSON/vb/visual studio express/deserialize has been purple for the past few days I just couldn't find how to find the total. EDIT: Later on I want to use the item string to return the values of the gear the player is wearing. You will get back a string which as the amount and the type in 1 line. "text": "+422 Dexterity", I would like to take the number 422 from that and add it to a total (of which would be Dexterity). If you have time, could you tell me how to do that when the 2 parts are in the same string? I know I have asked too much already so I understand if you don't want to :) Have a nice day (or morning)
I'm glad that this was helpful. If you get stuck with something, feel free to pm me and I will try to make some example for lolking.net.
To add to this, the current form (or class) should always be highlighted in the Solution Explorer. 
Perhaps you could show a screen shot of what you are currently seeing when you want to know what form you're looking at. If you're using the VS IDE then any code window will contain a dropdown that shows (*Form Name* Events) that contains that code. At the very least, the tab you are in would be the name of the form with a .vb extension. 
so this is vbscript? DateValue() just parses a string that has a date-like value into a date type variable. are you allowed to use the datepart() function? 
Hello there, I'm not sure why the list box is being used. This assignment is for my computer science course. And I appreciate the help but I'm not to sure how to even really start the program. Here is a picture of what the program should look like http://imgur.com/Lmhr7c9. And here is what it is suppose to do "Create a form like the one shown here. Use the naming conventions discussed in class to set the Name property for each of the controls. The labels and the button should be set as shown. The Text property for all text boxes should be blank initially. Use a list box to show the day of the week. Create a clear button with the command lstResults.Items.Clear() to reset the list box." 
I'm not at home right now so I'm not sure what exactly is returned when getting the stats on gear but from what you said you could use .split(" ") and take the 2nd value and put it through a select case statement for each stat since it would get separated at the space and the stat name would be in the 2nd index. 
Interesting! Thank you :). I really appreciate your help btw. I know I am a bit in over my head but I have a plan and its really exciting to make it work. I am having a new problem currently. I am done with the Career API and I am onto the Hero API. In HeroData("items") you get the list of the items the character is wearing (Here you can get a string for each item which gives you tons of data, names, stats etc). I can reference it directly by name to get the string: HeroData("items")("head")("tooltipParams") I am able to get all 13 items using names, but if the character doesn't have one of the items it will give an error (of course) because the item "hands" might not exist. I thought that I could references it by number instead and then create a loop through each of the items to get the string (I don't need the item names - just their values), but I am having trouble referring to it by number. Its not an array so I copied it into 'Items' &amp; used 'Items.count' to find out how many items the player had. Then I figured I could use a For loop going from 0 to the count, but my syntax is wrong when using the number. The problem is that I assumed I would be able to reference the number the same as the array (which is working perfectly - twice). I have tried things like: HeroData("items")(0) Items(0) 'is a copy of ("items") so I assume I didn't need to reference that again. if Items.exist("head") = true then msgbox("great!") If you can't be assed, don't worry about it :) I will make it work eventually I just figured I might as well ask. Let me know if you need any more information, but I don't believe you will. Thank you, Tom
 Dim HeroItems As Object = HeroData("items") Dim ItemSlot As String Dim tooltipParams As String For Each item In HeroItems ItemSlot += item.key() tooltipParams = item.value("tooltipParams") Next Then you can use http://us.battle.net/api/d3/data/item/&lt;tootipParams&gt; to get that information
Alright this actually helps. I'm going to try and see how it works out, thanks. 
Thanks guys, but what I meant was when debugging. There are so many forms and controls that come up after I start and progress through, it's hard to tell where I am. Let's say I want to work on the 10th form I see after starting up. I have no idea what it's called! I mean I can either guess looking through hundreds of folders, or I can CTRL+F to find a label or something. This is when I'm running the file to test via the GUI~ the play button
Alright, so, pretty much I want the "Next" button to reset the counter and values instead of just clearing the actual labels. Ex: I've recorded 10 scores so far, I press Next, and now I start all over. 
You need to set the variables back to zeros when you click Next. Right now you're using static variables so they stick around.
The doubles part is fine, but a static variable keeps its value even after you leave the sub you used it in, and the next time you enter the sub it uses the last value instead of being reset. That's fine since you're using them to keep a running total, but at some point you have to set them back to zero, which I assume is what the Next button should do. Just add intTotal = 0, intNumber = 0, and so on to the next button click section. 
Actually static is OK for what you're doing, unless you're going to declare them outside of a subroutine. Statics are good for things like running totals where you want to keep adding to it. You just have to reset them manually at some point. If you declare them using DIM and you do it inside the Record sub where they are now, they're going to default to zeros every time the sub runs.
...oh god. I forgot that I could even do that. Thank you, it's running exactly how I want!
For a fully functioning app, you do not want the text box to have anything but numbers and the appropriate separators. You can subclass the textbox to only accept numbers (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229644%28v=vs.80%29.aspx), or just check if it IsNumeric and provide a message to the user if it is not.
Create a variable and set it to be the SelectedIndex number. List boxes start at 0, so that would be the SelectedIndex number for your first result. Look into pulling that data out and setting it again :)
The problem is in order for me to load the right listbox's data, I click a row in the left listbox. So that event is SelectedIndexChanged. I need to avoid calling that event again when I manually set the selected index back to what it should be 
Surely you don't need to call it again? Make the variable a global variable and set it in your already existing SelectedIndexChanged event. That should work, right?
You'll need to use string.indexOf in conjunction with string.substring. IndexOf is a function that all strings come built with. When you call it, it returns a number that tells you how far into the string a certain character is located. For instance, if I had the string strHelloWorld = "Hello World!" and I ran strHelloWorld.IndexOf("H"), it would give me the value of 0 (because H is the first character of "Hello World!"). Substring is another function that all strings come built with, except this time it returns a shorter segment of the string. The first argument you provide to Substring is where to start returning, and the second argument is how many characters you want to return. Therefore, for the string strHelloWorld, if I ran strHelloWorld.Substring(0,5), I would get the return value of "Hello". Now, if you've been paying attention, you've probably figured out how you can use them in conjunction with each other. But because the syntax is a little weird, here's the code snippet. Dim locationOfSpace as Integer = strname.IndexOf(" ") lblFirstname.text = strname.substring(0, locationOfSpace)
Lookup the split function for the simple way or setup a loop For z = 1 to Len (nameStr) and check the val of the mid function. Don't want to give you too much more as it is homework. I think that should help
well since I got nailed last tiem for helping with homework I am going to give you concepts. you need to start with generating a random number and storing it in a variable. Here is the documentation from [MSDN Random Class](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.random.aspx) Then you need a [loop](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ezk76t25.aspx) that continues until the user guesses correctly. loop until response = stored variable with random number In the loop you need to read in the users response and then check to see if it is above or below the variable provided. This is called an [if structure](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/752y8abs.aspx) I hope these pointers help. **Bone**
I figured it out, but thanks anyways! 
Great thanks! Exactly what i was looking for.
Can you post your code in a gist rather than a picture of a portion of it. 
To create a sub you would use the following structure; Public Sub DoStuff() 'Paste code here End Sub The easiest way for you to run that code would be to put a button on a form, double click it and paste the code into the button sub created. This will get you up and running, code looks ok from a quick glance, let us know if there are any issues. **Bone**
Now it says you must have a startup or sub Main() if I try to run it by itself or Invalid inside procedure at Private Sub Command1_Click() or Type statrec both are being highlighted when I use form button.
Is this an existing app, or a chunk of code that has been provided to you? 
It was written in late 90s and early 2000s by the guy who had my position before me. Most of the things he worked on had no documentation, so I've just been figuring it out as I go. 
Visual Basic has a timer built in. It's just called Timer in the controls list
Welc
Thanks for commenting.
It's [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/visualbasic/comments/2jrcoo/i_need_help_with_my_visual_basic_project/) isn't it?
One quick and dirty way is to simply put the values on the clipboard and then "paste" into an Excel sheet. The paste part is manual; give the user a MsgBox telling them to do a "paste" into a new Excel sheet. Public Sub ExportToExcelViaClipboard(Grid As DataGridView) Dim sb = New StringBuilder(32768) ' Headers For Each hdr As DataGridViewColumn In Grid.Columns If hdr.CellType.Name &lt;&gt; "DataGridViewImageCell" Then sb.Append(hdr.HeaderText.Trim &amp; vbTab) Next sb.AppendLine() ' Data For Each row As DataGridViewRow In Grid.Rows For Each cell As DataGridViewCell In row.Cells If cell.GetType.Name &lt;&gt; "DataGridViewImageCell" Then Dim value = "" If cell.Value IsNot Nothing Then value = cell.Value.ToString If value = "0001-01-01 00:00:00" Then value = "" ' "Nothing" date sb.Append(value &amp; vbTab) End If Next sb.AppendLine() Next Clipboard.SetText(sb.ToString) End Sub A similar approach can be used to generate a .CSV file (although if you use older Excel versions, you'll have to use "," as a separator while newer version expect ";"... If you want to create a "real" Excel sheet with formatting, color, formulas, etc, you can add a reference to one of the various "Microsoft Office X.XX Object Library" and use the Excel objects to create and save a new sheet. There are a lot of examples around on the web.
Try commenting out loops one at a time to try and isolate where it's happening. 
YESS!!!! Thank you so much!! aha maybe someone else had the same class as me!!!
Thanks! I ended up trying a tryparse first but was having difficulties but then did a simple if statement to check for isinteger and I got it
I just started learing VB today! **head explodes*
I took a quick look and I'm assuming your error is in the nested if tree you have and you wanted them all to be separate. If txtHoursWorked &lt; 0 Then MessageBox.Show("Please Enter a Number", "Error") If txtRate &lt; 0 Or " " Then MessageBox.Show("Please Enter a Decimal", "Error") If txtStateTax &lt; 0 Or " " Then MessageBox.Show("Please Enter a Decimal", "Error") If txtFederalTax &lt; 0 Or " " Then MessageBox.Show("Please Enter a Decimal", "Error") If txtFICA &lt; 0 Or " " Then MessageBox.Show("Please Enter a Decimal", "Error") End If End If End If End If End If like this If txtHoursWorked &lt; 0 Then MessageBox.Show("Please Enter a Number", "Error") End If If txtRate &lt; 0 Or " " Then MessageBox.Show("Please Enter a Decimal", "Error") End If If txtStateTax &lt; 0 Or " " Then MessageBox.Show("Please Enter a Decimal", "Error") End If If txtFederalTax &lt; 0 Or " " Then MessageBox.Show("Please Enter a Decimal", "Error") End If If txtFICA &lt; 0 Or " " Then MessageBox.Show("Please Enter a Decimal", "Error") End If There are other things that you're going to run in to once that's fixed though. Like how the program will still execute the calculations even if there are blank boxes. A better solution would be else if and at the end have an else statement that executes the calculations because none are blank. Speaking of calculations, varHoursWorked = CDbl(txtHoursWorked) varHoursWorked = lblHoursWorked.Text I'm not sure if you noticed, but you're giving the same variable a different value in the very next line. Did you want to assign the lblHoursWorked.Text to the varHoursWorked variable? If so you need to swap it. lblHoursWorked.Text = varHoursWorked There are some other questionable things but you may find workarounds and playing around is uncountably the best way to learn to code so I'll let you play with that. If you get stuck or have other questions, try to be specific and explain what is happening so we can better help you. This was just my guess of what you were referencing.
I believe doing If not integer.tryparse as the first line then having the error messagenext should work, then have the rest of the code in the else statement. Oh and btw, invalid isnt a very good error message, remember that the user is stupid. Probably should revise that with more explanation.
Your button click sub is just declaring some variables, but it's not calling any of your functions. Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Dim height As Double = TextBox1.Text Dim weight As Double = TextBox2.Text End Sub You need to call BmiCalc to get the BMI value, then call BmiCategory and pass it the bmi value you got fromBmiCalc, then show your output. To use a function, you pass it the arguments you've assigned, and it returns a value that you can use. For BmiCategory you have "Category" as an argument, but it shouldn't be because you're not going to tell it the category to use, you're only going to give it the BMI value and it's going to return the category. Try this for button click, then try to fix your functions so they work correctly: Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Dim Height As Double = TextBox1.Text Dim Weight As Double = TextBox2.Text Dim Bmi As Double = BmiCalc(Height, Weight) Dim Category As String = BmiCategory(Bmi) MessageBox.Show("Your BMI is: " &amp; Bmi.ToString &amp; vbCrLf &amp; "The category is: " &amp; Category) End Sub Keep in mind that this is really basic, and doesn't have any error checking at all (what if I put ABC in as my weight?) but it will at least get you pointed in the right direction.
write the same code on form.load event, this would do it. u're putting the code on textChanged event which only activate the code when the user writes in the textbox 
your strSQLCritical is defined in the Page_Load subroutine, so you can't access it outside of that. You could declare it at the page level, but probably a better idea would be to put an ASP:Label control where you want the output to be. So something like this where you want the output to be on the page: &lt;ASP:Label ID="lblSQLCriticalInfo" RunAt="Server"/&gt; Then in your page_load code where you actually set the strSQLCritical value, you could write if strSQLCritical &lt;&gt; "0" then lblSQLCriticalInfo.text = strSQLCritical else lblSQLCriticalInfo.text = "" end if
I made a single-line textbox called SearchBox, a button called SearchButton, and a multi-line textbox called ResultsBox. https://www.dropbox.com/s/freq515ohrhc4yo/WpfApplication1.zip?dl=0 Imports System.Data Imports System.Xml Class MainWindow Private Sub SearchButton_Click(sender As Object, e As RoutedEventArgs) Handles SearchButton.Click Dim searchterm As String searchterm = SearchBox.Text ResultsBox.Text = "" If searchterm.Length &gt; 0 Then Dim xml As XmlReader Dim ds As New DataSet Dim dtc As DataTableCollection Dim cols As DataColumnCollection xml = XmlReader.Create("XMLFile.xml") ds.ReadXml(xml) dtc = ds.Tables For Each dt As DataTable In dtc cols = dt.Columns For Each dr As DataRow In dt.Rows Dim found As Boolean = False For Each c In cols Dim value As String value = dr(c).ToString() If value.Contains(searchterm) And found = False Then found = True ResultsBox.Text &amp;= dt.TableName &amp; ":" &amp; vbNewLine &amp; vbTab &amp; String.Join(vbTab, dr.ItemArray()) &amp; vbNewLine &amp; "---" &amp; vbNewLine End If Next Next Next End If End Sub End Class
It's not the greatest solution, but: Dim word1 As String = "just" Dim word2 As String = "wonderin" Dim result As String = Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture.TextInfo.ToTitleCase(word1 &amp; " " &amp; word2)
Also, I noticed that you are linking to your xml like this: myStreamReader = System.IO.File.OpenText("..\..\customers.xml") To have your xml file be included in your build and copied into the bin folder along with the executable, you can add the file to your project, then set its "Copy to Output Directory" property to anything other than "Do not copy". After that, you can get rid of the "..\\..\".
First of all thanks a lot for the help I really appreciate. I added in the the code you provided to test the search in my file and it works perfectly however I need the results to be displayed in a matter that I can select them. I guess I should have added that in my post, basically the reason why I want it to display in a DataGridView was so that I could select the customer and then click an edit button to edit that customers information. I toyed with the code a bit and did this: If value.Contains(searchterm) And found = False Then found = True foundList.Add(String.Join(",", dr.ItemArray())) search.dgvCustomersFound.DataSource = foundList search.ShowDialog() End If However all this does is display the length of the array in the datagridview. Is there a way I can display the customer in a way I can select it?
You, sir, are my hero.
`CommaPosRight` is a `Long` and `InStr` expects an `Integer`: Public Function InStr(Start As Integer, String1 As String, String2 As String, Optional Compare As Microsoft.VisualBasic.CompareMethod = Binary) As Integer
Your just suggesting he invert the if statement, how is that different from what is happening above. j This: Dim number1 As Integer = CInt(txtZip.Text) If Integer.TryParse(txtZip.Text, number1) Then subtotal += PRICE_ZIP * CInt(txtZip.Text) lstBox.Items.Add(" Plus " &amp; number1 &amp; " zip linings sessions-Price: $30") Else MessageBox.Show("invalid") End If And this: Dim number1 As Integer = CInt(txtZip.Text) If Not Integer.TryParse(txtZip.Text, number1) Then MessageBox.Show("invalid") Else subtotal += PRICE_ZIP * CInt(txtZip.Text) lstBox.Items.Add(" Plus " &amp; number1 &amp; " zip linings sessions-Price: $30") End If Are the same Your missing the real problem in that he is calling **CInt(txtZip.Text)** which if it can't parse something throws an InvalidCastException Check it out here. https://dotnetfiddle.net/D3J98C This should work: Dim number1 As Integer If Integer.TryParse(txtZip.Text, number1) Then subtotal += PRICE_ZIP * CInt(txtZip.Text) lstBox.Items.Add(" Plus " &amp; number1 &amp; " zip linings sessions-Price: $30") Else MessageBox.Show("invalid") End If 
hey op if you don't see the comment I added to this please look at http://www.reddit.com/r/visualbasic/comments/2k0hej/help_with_visual_basic_project/clii8re I've fixed your problem.
It would be difficult for me to guess how you envision the user interface working for the scenario you've got in mind, so rather than try to whip up an overly-complicated and way-off-target example of filtered XML results bound to DataGridViews, I'll just Google up something along those lines: http://vbcity.com/blogs/xtab/archive/2011/02/14/how-to-filter-data-from-an-xml-file-into-a-datagridview.aspx Hope it sends you in the right direction!

I have always found loading XML into a [dataset](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fx29c3yd.aspx) and then manipulating it is much easier dataSet.ReadXml("{input.xml}", XmlReadMode.ReadSchema) You can also write back out to your XML from the dataset. dataset.WriteXml("{input.xml}", XmlWriteMode.WriteSchema) This way you can bind your dataset directly to controls. Dim foundRows() As Data.DataRow foundRows = DataSet1.Tables("XMLDataSet").Select("CompanyName Like 'A%') would return all rows that start with A You could also look at LINQ to XML which allows SQL Queries against XML data. This is the most mdoern approach but I still like dealing with datasets more :) **Bone** 
Prepare for Cease&amp;Desist! Good work though.
If you're using pictures or some form of visual item (like a panel, pbox, etc) you can assign it a tag. In the properties. You can assign, modify, or edit this from both code and design
everything from the command line goes into the WScript.Arguments object, so just pull it from there
you want to use [InputBox\(\)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3yfdhzk5%28v=vs.84%29.aspx) e.g. if you have parm=WScript.Arguments(1) just change to parm=Inputbox("wat.")
Thanks!
Thanks!
I would replace searchbox.setattribute with searchbox.innertext = "test" where test is whatever string you want to search.
I tried that before but it wouldn't hurt to try again, I'll let you know how that goes tomorrow morning
Your code should generally work, I tried and similar attempt worked just fine for me: Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load WebBrowser1.Navigate("http://bing.com") End Sub Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Dim textbox = WebBrowser1.Document.GetElementById("sb_form_q") textbox.SetAttribute("value", "patenbrigade wolff") Dim button = WebBrowser1.Document.GetElementById("sb_form_go") button.InvokeMember("click") End Sub I would guess that you're trying to call search before Bing site is fully loaded in WebBrowser1. You can check if document has fully loaded using ReadyState property: If (WebBrowser1.ReadyState = WebBrowserReadyState.Complete) Then 'Your code here... End If or handle DocumentCompleted event: Private Sub WebBrowser1_DocumentCompleted(sender As Object, e As WebBrowserDocumentCompletedEventArgs) Handles WebBrowser1.DocumentCompleted 'Your code here End Sub As a more general suggestion, you can look at consuming Bing search API instead of using website directly (http://datamarket.azure.com/dataset/bing/search)
That actually worked declaring CommaPsLeft As integer Thanks very much for this guys :) 
This sounds like a way to hack somebody's gmail account. Need more information for the use before I help. **Bone**
good point, gmail was a bad example. I'm using it for bing automation with multiple accounts. I can do it one account at a time, but I was hoping I could sign into all of them at once to save time.
Let me make sure I understand what you want; two instances of a browser object, each with different user accounts but when browser 1 logs in you want browser 2 to use the same credentials and login? OR do you want to login to a bunch of browser windows (same site) all with different credentials at the same time **Bone**
The decision to never touch Visual Basic again.
Since I was a noob, and still partially am, I've made software that basically lets people build TV graphics from multiple computers, and then at the main machine you just double clicked from a list or typed in the number and it would feed the data to the graphics machine's template. Was used in a student setting where we didn't have a lot of money, but wanted uniformity, Worked well!
If you replace New From {previous, [next]}).First() with Select New With {previous, [next]}).First() does that work? 
Do you have the credentials before hand? Can you use something like Watin or selenium to automate this? 
I've already coded the automation part, and I do have the credentials for each account I'll be using. Right now I sign in to one account and run my automation and then sign out and in to the next account, I was hoping there was a way to sign in to all of them at the same time.
 Select New With {previous, [next]}).First() Worked but I am getting getting an 'Anonymous Type' Can not be converted to 'Orientation type" thanks I see how I screwed up the select conversion. Now I have to figure out how to return the correct type :) Appreciated **Bone** 
What are you using for automation? 
I figured it out, I was not specifying if I wanted the next or previous record :) Here is the working version From c In dbContext.Orientations Where c.OrientationID = currentOrientationID Let ordered = dbContext.Orientations.OrderBy(Function(d) c.PageNumber) Let previous = ordered.TakeWhile(Function(e) c.OrientationID &lt;&gt; currentOrientationID).LastOrDefault() Let [next] = ordered.SkipWhile(Function(f) c.OrientationID &lt;&gt; currentOrientationID).Skip(1).FirstOrDefault() Select New With {previous, [next]}).First().next **Bone**
What version of Visual Studio are you using? One thing you could try as a quick test would be to turn off the visual studio hosting process, which can help with debugging, but sometimes can cause problems with certain libraries or components. Under your project properties, in the debug tab, uncheck "Enable the Visual Studio hosting process" and see if that makes any difference.
I am currently using Visual Studio 6.0. 
I made a bitcoin mining monitor, and an app that aided learning quotes (although other stuff would work too, like languages) 
What OS are you running because Visual Studio 6 (VB6) is not supported on any OS past Windows XP. That does not mean it will not run, it just means Microsoft did no testing with it on Vista and later, so there can be odd issues. The VB6 runtime itself is still supported and tested on newer versions of Windows, but the IDE itself is known to have issues. Is there a reason you can't look to start using VB.NET with one of the newer free express editions of Visual Studio?
I'm not sure about cool but my favorite project was an application where you could select parts of an image and it created another picture with a compilation of the selected parts. It was for someone who had tens of thousands of scans of documents and they needed the barcode and serial number off each one. It was cool to me because I first wrote a very naive approach where it could only do 1 per second and refactored it and made it multithreadred and the final version did 30/sec with 10k x 35k resolution pictures.
are you asking how to download the mp3, or how to parse the html to get the url?
the decision to switch to C#
So are we doing your homework?
you'll want a separate array for each of the sets of things you have checkboxes for, then append the arrays that have boxes checked into a temporary array and makes your password from that
I'm asking how to find the mp3 in the web page. If that means parsing the html then the second one :)
I would suggest you look at an [ascii table](http://www.asciitable.com/). One of the easiest ways to do this is use the CHR function and convert the character code back into a letter. Dim rand As Random = New Random Dim TempPass as string = "" For x = 1 to 10 dim randNumber as integer = rand.Next(33, 125) TempPass = TempPaass &amp; chr(randnumber) next This will generate a random password including symbols upper and lower without having to have a picklist or all the headache. all you need to do with this is use checkbox to modify the range of the random number. Here is another possibility... Imports System Imports System.Collections.Generic Imports System.Text Imports System.Security.Cryptography Imports System.Windows.Forms Public Class Form1 Private randomBytes() As Byte Private randomInt32Value As Integer Private possibleChars As String Private len As Int32 Private GetRandomInt32Value As New RandomInt32Value Private GetPasswordGenProfiler As New PasswordGenProfiler Public Sub New() ' This call is required by the designer. InitializeComponent() ' Add any initialization after the InitializeComponent() call. possibleChars = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&amp;*()" len = 8 End Sub Private Sub btnGenerate_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnGenerate.Click Try Dim cpossibleChars() As Char cpossibleChars = possibleChars.ToCharArray() If cpossibleChars.Length &lt; 1 Then MessageBox.Show("You must enter one or more possible characters.") Return End If If len &lt; 4 Then MessageBox.Show(String.Format("Please choose a password length. That length must be a value between {0} and {1}. Note: values above 1,000 might take a LONG TIME to process on some computers.", 4, Int32.MaxValue)) Return End If Dim builder As New StringBuilder() For i As Integer = 0 To len - 1 Dim randInt32 As Integer = GetRandomInt32Value.GetRandomInt() Dim r As New Random(randInt32) Dim nextInt As Integer = r.[Next](cpossibleChars.Length) Dim c As Char = cpossibleChars(nextInt) builder.Append(c) Next Me.Label1.Text = builder.ToString() Catch ex As Exception MessageBox.Show(String.Format("An error has occurred while trying to generate random password! Technical description: {0}", ex.Message.ToString())) End Try End Sub End Class Public Class PasswordGenProfiler Public Shared Function GetFrequencyDistributionOfChars(allowableChars As String, generatedPass As String) As Dictionary(Of Char, Integer) Dim distrib As New Dictionary(Of Char, Integer)() ' initialize all values to 0 For Each c As Char In allowableChars ' If character is listed more than once, don't re-add it to our list. If Not distrib.ContainsKey(c) Then distrib.Add(c, 0) End If Next Dim val As Integer = 0 For Each passChar As Char In generatedPass If distrib.TryGetValue(passChar, val) Then distrib(passChar) = System.Threading.Interlocked.Increment(val) End If Next Return distrib End Function End Class Imports System.Security.Cryptography Public Class RandomInt32Value Public Function GetRandomInt() As Integer Dim randomBytes As Byte() = New Byte(3) {} Dim rng As New RNGCryptoServiceProvider() rng.GetBytes(randomBytes) Dim randomInt As Integer = BitConverter.ToInt32(randomBytes, 0) Return randomInt End Function End Class 
This is awesome! Thank you
using the right terms will increase your chances of success. I've seen a few examples on parsing html to extract images, adapt one.
Tell us what you have so far and we will help. I won't just do it for you.
I made a budgeting program that maintained a 1.4B budget for a major university. Job wise that's the coolest thing I've done with VB. 
Back when I was in my CIS classes, my instructor taught us to use a piece of paper and write down your variables. Then Start at the beginning and step through the code. By hand, not in the IDE. Record the variables as they change and you can see your logic in action. tl;dr is you are popping the message box in each loop.
Don't use so many pop-ups. Use a + and - button. Click. Back_colour += 1. Click Back_colour -= 1.
Saturation is defined by how much of OTHER colors are mixed in with the color your want to saturate/de-saturate. Let's say I have red=128, green=128, and blue=128. I would have middle gray (on a scale of 0 to 255), which would be NO saturation since all the color values are the same. If I increase the red, while decreasing the blue and green in equal amounts, I would increase the saturation for red (the difference between the values is increasing).
I played around a bit in the color chooser of Paint. It seems to be all about moving the RGB values toward equal values. So 100% saturation for red is 255,0,0. 50% saturation is 192,64,64. 0% is 127,127,127. It's just a sliding scale between whatever the color was, and what the neutral grey is. It gets a little weird for random RGB values, though. I tried a weird orange color, 255,127,64, and the neutral grey (0% saturation) was 159,159,159. I'm not sure where the program got 159 from. The average of those three values is 149. Anyway, if someone can explain the math to me, I'd be grateful.

Please post your code so we can see what's wrong.
Your Do While will only end when counter is more than 1, but nothing ever changes the value of counter. I think you meant to do Counter += 1 Instead of L += 1
You can use the `My.Resources` module that is automatically generated for the project resources. If `alex.png` is correctly added to the resources you can do something like Me.BackgroundImage = My.Resources.alex If this does not work as intended check your resources in the resources tab in the project properties. 
I think you need a `ListView` for that. Set its `View` property to `Details` and define the required `Columns`.
You also have to change the end contition: Do While counter &lt;= l (And declare `c` as `Integer` instead of `String`)
That fixed the forever looping problem. Thanks a lot ^^ Now the problem that I have is that it wont detect any A vowels now :\
thanks! im at school now but i'll give that a shot when i get home
What is the problem you have run into, or do you expect us to just finish your school project for you? 
Someone has suggested a great idea recently - to include new Classic VB into future Windows versions (just like VBA is built into Office)! Support it by voting &amp; commenting [here](http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579/suggestions/6008370). Thanks!
I think it should be Do While counter &lt;= L
How long do you expect the answers to be? 
Well PM me them when you get a chance I don't mind helping you out. I do .Net Development (Visual Basic and C#) for the Canadian Government. 
*Any* high-language can be taught to a beginner. What's most important is to learn the basic concepts of programming, such as declarations, variables, functions, conditionals, etc.. I feel like that is something which is better learned in the class room. Once you get the basics down, learning a new language via books or online tutorials is easier and makes more sense. Maybe there's a an "Intro to Programming" class at a local college you both can take?
Absolutely... I'm completely self taught, have been programing professionally for over a dozen years, write in a handful of languages, was a senior level dev at my last job, and have owned my own company for about 6 years. Getting the basics is easy enough, getting a really deep understanding will require a lot of dedication, and a never ending process of learning, but it can be a really fun hobby. Like melot2K1 said, you really want to focus on fundamentals of programing, and not specifically VB, once you get past the beginning stages. Understanding this larger picture allows you to see beyond the constraints of one language, and opens up a lot of other opportunities. The link below is a great place to start: http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Visual-Basic-Fundamentals-for-Absolute-Beginners 
Thank you very much! Your reply was quite encouraging!
Great idea - there are several nearby opportunities for continuing education. I'll see what is available. He probably doesn't need an intro class, but I certainly do!
You could shorten it a lot with a lambda expression, too. :-) Single function to count any type of vowel (or any other character): Private Function CountVowel(Text As String, Vowel As String) As Integer Dim Count As Integer = 0 Text.ToList.ForEach(Sub(c) If Vowel.Contains(c.ToString.ToLower) Then Count += 1) Return Count End Function Put this for Button "A": Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click MsgBox("Count of A: " &amp; CountVowel(TextBox1.Text, "a")) End Sub Repeat for each button.
VB.net is a great learning program, its an easy step to C# which is a fully commercial language. But make sure you are learning VB.net and not just VB. VB is too antiquated and will teach you an outdated framework that you will just need to 'unlearn' later. 
Thanks for this tip!
Thank you! Glad you had such a good experience - that sounds awesome! 
make sure you actually participate in relevant groups on linked-in. this is a minor start though. you network in person, not on the web. check meetup for local .net groups, and see if you can match up names in linked-in and meetup and make a point to talk to them, even if it's just "I've seen you post in xyz group on linked-in".
Button Code: Private Sub Button2_Click(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button2.Click Dim Value As String = InputBox("Please enter a non-negative integer value", "INPUT NEEDED", 10) If String.IsNullOrEmpty(Value) Then Exit Sub ElseIf IsNumeric(Value) = False Then MsgBox("Value contains invalid characters. Please enter a positive integer value.") Exit Sub ElseIf Val(Value &lt; 0) Then MsgBox("You entered a negative number. Please enter a positive integer value.") Exit Sub Else Calculate(Math.Floor(Val(Value))) End If End Sub * Step 1: Capture Input Text to a String * Step 2: Make sure something was entered, else Input was not cancelled * Step 3: Ensure the Input value is a number * Step 4: Ensure Input value is non-negative * Step 5: Calculate and Produce an Output String Sub to Calculate and Display: Dim strOutput As New System.Text.StringBuilder Dim Calculation As Integer = 0 For i = 1 To Val Calculation += i If Not i = Val Then strOutput.Append(i &amp; "+") Else strOutput.Append(i) End If Next MsgBox("The sum of '" &amp; strOutput.ToString &amp; "' is " &amp; Calculation, MsgBoxStyle.OkOnly, "SUM OF NUMBERS") I used Math.Floor in case a decimal value was entered. Val() grab the number as a Double, and Math.Lower will round it down to the lower whole number.
Linked-In groups... Good idea. I only recently created a Linked-In account, and haven't even checked for groups. I appreciate the reply! :-) Unfortunately for me, I live in a pretty remote location so "in person" networking is very difficult.
Craigslist, eh? I hadn't considered that as a place to look for VB related postings. Always envisioned it as the go-to place to buy "somewhat used" toasters and find sketchy love interests. lol Thanks much for the reply! I'll give it a search. 
Vb.net is a commercially viable language. It is essentially the exact same language as c# with just a few differences in functionality.
Make an effort to learn the syntax of c# if you are competent with VB you should have no problem learning c# they are almost identical Then look for .net developer positions or c# positions as well as vb.net a few weeks will greatly increase your job prospects.
I agree, I worded it that way as there are far more jobs in C# than VB.net
My job is in VB and I honestly wish it was c# at times. C# feels more programmy.
It does, but it can also just be a pain in the ass to "get shit done". I'm forcing myself to learn C# because I feel like it's time to wear big boy pants, but it's amazing how much time I've wasted just trying to work out a few things VB just handles automagically. Most of the time I end up finding out I just needed to do something differently (the C# way), but when it comes to reading nullable fields from a database, I just want my VB back.
Forgot to add. I basically just need any help on the code for "button2"
Can't you use null coalescing operator in C# for this something like outputvalue = ReadDBField() ?? DefaultValue; I find it much nicer then using something like this outputvalue = If(ReadDBField(),ReadDBField(),DefaultValue) Or is that an example of what you are trying to do. What I find very annoying with VB is the way they handle generics and array syntax. Here is a couple of examples C# Foo[0] VB Foo(0) You can tell that the above is alookup in a collection in C# without having to look at the type of foo C# Foo[0]("Bar") VB Foo(0)("Bar) If I showed you the vb code you'd not be able to tell me if it's a collection containing a collection, a collection containing a function, a function that returns a function. With C# it's pretty apparent that it's a collection that returns a method call. And in this case C# Foo&lt;List&lt;bar&gt;&gt;(x =&gt; x.ToString())[0] VB Foo(of List(of bar))(Function(x) x.ToString())(0) I personally much prefer the C# to the vb but really that's a personal preference I have an easier time visually parsing the C# to the vb. Now the few things that I do like in VB but that haven't really used at all is XML literals, I'm more likely to read an xml from a file then type it directly in my code, I've only used it once in my ten years of vb development but it was handy. 
&gt; Can't you use null coalescing operator in C# for this something like &gt; &gt; outputvalue = ReadDBField() ?? DefaultValue; &gt; &gt; I find it much nicer then using something like this &gt; &gt; outputvalue = If(ReadDBField(),ReadDBField(),DefaultValue) I was using: SqlDateTime? derp = reader.IsDBNull(ordDerp) ? (SqlDateTime?)null : reader.GetSqlDateTime(ordDerp); I've never seen the null coalescing operator before. What I can't figure out is how to use it like this: SqlDateTime? derp = reader.GetSqlDateTime(ordDerp) ?? (SqlDateTime?)null; I get this error message: Left operand of the '??' operator should be of reference or nullable type If I could figure out how to return reader.GetSqlDateTime as nullable, I would have no problems to begin with. What might I be doing wrong, or what could I do differently? * **ordDerp** being the column ordinal for the Derp field, of course.
Yeah so obviously I didn't pick a good operator I think the ternary operator is a good fit here I'd personally shove it in an extension method something like Public static class extensions { public static SqlDateTime? ToNullable(this SqlDateTime dt ) { return (DT.IsNull)?(SqlDateTime?)null:dt:; } } And call it like var derp = reader.GetDateTime(ordDerp).ToNullable(); Pardon any mistakes I did this on my phone on the bus home.
Or something like public static T? ToNullable&lt;T&gt;( this SqlReader r, string name){ return r.IsDbNull(name)?(T?)null:r.GetFieldValue&lt;T&gt;(name); } var deep = SqlReader.ToNullable&lt;SqlDateTime&gt;(ordDerp); For some reason reddit news.pro is not showing the angle brackets, that should be a generic method of type T and calling it with type SqlDateTime
I'll have to play with this. It would be really nice to not have to use the ternary method every single time. Thanks!
use csv to start it loads into Excel. I have seen it done with [XSLT transform](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsdesktop/VBXslTransformXml-6934020d) but that seems kinda complicated. I use something like this Dim doc As XDocument = XDocument.Parse(xmlString) ' Create a string builder to hold the output CSV Dim theOutput As New StringBuilder(1000) ' Loop through the nodes of the XML For Each node As XElement In doc.Descendants("name of element you want to start at") For Each innerNode As XElement In node.Elements() theOutput.AppendFormat("{0},", innerNode.Attribute("data").Value) Next ' Remove trailing comma theOutput.Remove(theOutput.Length - 1, 1) theOutput.AppendLine() Next ' Write output to file and do whatever you want the file here File.WriteAllText("path to file.csv", theOutput.ToString()) 
You could create additional arrays in the SelectedIndexChange event to capture the names of the songs that match each genre. Loop through the indices of _strGenre, and if the value at that index matches the selected value, add the value of the same index on _strName to a new array. The same could be used to capture and add the lengths of the songs.
Absolutely, and the tutorial you linked is a good place to start. Once you get through that, there should several card game / poker samples on Channel 9 as well. Searching "vb.net poker" on Google should also turn up some sample code (but it may be above your level until you get through the link).
Thanks for the reply and the advice. I'll definitely make a go at learning Visual Basic then. Also, I saw that tutorial link on one of your other comments--so double thanks.
The Color class will give you the HSV set using the methods: Color.GetSaturation Color.GetHue Color.GetBrightness
But doesnt "i" have to be like "j" to have a pair? Sry im still new and still trying to learn it D:
The way it is written you are comparing every dice to every dice. This means you are also comparing every dice to itself. You need to compare every dice to *every other* dice and you would do this by also making sure i is not equal to j.
Edit: Sorry, I'm in /visualbasic and not /net. Re-formatted my answer. Do you have .NET? If so, I would totally skip Excel, macros and that old VB6. I would just run a SQL query, loop through the results - while sql_Datareader.read, format your arguments for sendmail function and call it a day. I'm not familiar with the G-Mail part as I use a corporate exchange mail server for my daily SQL reports. If you can't make a stand alone app and have to do it via Macros it is definitely doable in Excel. It would just be ten times easier in .NET IMO.
I am not sure if I have .NET. I am open to any and all suggestions.
Do you have Visual Studio(I say .NET, probably a hab habit)? Or were you planning on creating this in a macro inside of Excel? 
I guess a macro in Excel VB is just very confusing and counter intuitive 
Dude give us a break. I know C# and I choose VB.Net. Why the hell would you say that here in the Visual Basic forum?
just to piss you off. Chill dude. It was a joke.
Based on the documentation, they've been around since .net 1.1 but I only discovered them about a month ago after I also wrote my own.
hmm ok, done some modification to the code, something like that? Still cant pick the biggest pair tho, any idea how to fix that?
Post your modified code
I edited the original one
I just tried your code and it seems to be working. Using 3 3 4 4 5 returns 8 instead of 6. What is "regel" for? It doesn't seem to be used. Edit: just noticed that with your code the way it is now it relies on the dice to be in ascending order, so if you use 4 4 3 3 5 it will give you 6. You need to add a check so that you never set sum to a lower value than it already is.
Try the change I mentioned in my last comment and let me know if that fixes it.
Ok with some searching and asking around it finally worked! Thank you for helping me :)
Without trying it for myself I can't be certain, but wont the drag and drop code end once you move out side the Treeview? I'm not sure it would allow you to use that controls methods out side of the control. Maybe I am wrong. Maybe the trick is to tie it in with the forms MouseDown event, so that if the Treeview MouseDown and the Forms MouseDown event are both active then save the Trailer info in a variable and change the cursor manually to a drag and drop cursor. The main issue for me would be how to get the DGV row address when a MouseUp event is activated. There's a DGVCell.MouseUp event which you might be able to use to get the cell reference. From there you could load in the Trailer info from the variable and change the cursor back. There might be a more elegant way using the drag and drop methods you describe, but sometimes you just need to make progress. Consider the above a last resort.
hmm got any idea how to do 2 pairs? I dont even know what I'm doing anymore
I think I'd create a custom object/class that would be created to capture and store the pertinent data on MouseDown, to drop on the DGV. An icon could be drawn (GDI) and locked to the mouse location. A drag state variable/enum could be tied to the mouse events. I have a silly little game project that I was toying with, where a character is created and you can drag him around the screen to avoid spawning and flocking dragons.
Also in a module, Have Public Rank(13) as String
There are plenty of jobs (and good jobs, too) using VB.net. I currently work as a vb.net developer. As others have suggested, participate in groups on sites like linked in. These can be a big help as well as help you build a better skill set. There are most certainly other skills that will expand the job pool for you. Since you said you are a hobby developer I'm assuming you didn't go to school for it. To understand more about the skills required to land a .net job, you have to look at more of the bigger picture and other tools you should learn as well to use with VB. The biggest helper skill that can help a VB.net developer land a job is SQL. Any version of it really. You need to understand how relational databases work as majority of .net work is basically CRMs - taking in data, modifying it if needed, spitting it out. Knowing VB is fine and dandy, but when you know SQL you can then put your VB skills to work in hand with SQL. This is what I do for work, as our applications are basically CRM's. The second biggest helper skill in my eyes is javascript. Learning javascript for use with your front end will greatly increase the amount of control you have in designing applications. This comes with an overall understanding of how .net works in regards to loading and order of operations. I learned javascript after college and it has completely changed the way I code and look at business problems in which I'm responsible for finding a solution. You can use integrated javascript with VB to handle just about any issue would need to tackle. A few examples how javascript helps; lets say you are designing a page that is taking information from a client, and you may need a varied amount of responses (going back to the SQL mention - this is a single to multi relationship) - for example if you were taking information from someone regarding a kids soccer team. For each child you need their name, tee shirt size, and number. Since you don't know the amount of children until told - you need to have a way of producing enough front end line items to fill out all the information. You can use javascript to add rows as well as then use javascript on envoke of a button to save a set with varied length. You can even use this to help you load the proper amount of extra items. Not to go too much into detail with this example, but javascript is basically a bread and butter tool that good .net developers need to utilize to solve problems and enhance user experience (cut out the need to even hit the server side to complete certain tasks (order of operations) - like input validation, add more rows to a table on the fly, etc). I'm from Philly, and there are a ton of recruiters that are always looking for vb.net guys. It is a great advantage to know C# - but there are places that use solely VB (like the current company I work for). I'd highly suggest looking for a staffing firm around you. Even if a job from them doesn't work out - just viewing some of the positions they are trying to fill can give you a better idea of where to look as well as what skills current companies are looking for. If you ever need anything else comment or feel free to drop me a PM. As a former TA in college - its more so about learning the application lifecycle and how your implementation will help solve a problem rather than code syntax. That's the beauty of development. As long as you think of how to cover solutions for all the business issues - you can pretty much do whatever you want to implement these as long as it works. This is why its a science rather than an art. If you use proven methods to create solutions, there will always be development work available. People get too choked up on the actual coding rather than the creative problem solving needed in order to produce a quality product.
Now i got a porblem with finding the biggest two pairs, check edit 4
if you were to put into your loop when checking this line System.Windows.Forms.Application.DoEvents() it will free up system resources so repaints etc. happen when the loop is run. I would suggest that it would be better to run the battery check on a timer that checks every X period of time (Whatever you think is good. 30 Seconds?) this way you are not eating up all your local computer processing cycles on a while loop. Lastly I would create a thread that does nothing but watch and then fires an event when the percentage changes. Thus you could have your code fire every time there is a change in the state of the battery not every time the check occurs.
ok lets make this easier, lets look at a deck of cards, and break it down a deck of cards has 52 cards, 4 suits with 13 cards per suit. The suits are defined as Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, and Clubs. I want you to rename the PNG images so that they are in order of suit. Hearts - Cards 1 - 13 Diamonds - Cards 14 - 26 Clubs - Cards 27 - 39 Spades - cards 40-52 Now lets create an array for your cards Dim Deck(52) as integer lets fill that deck with the card values Dim tempCard As Integer = 0 For x = 1 To 4 For y = 1 To 13 tempCard = tempCard + 1 Select Case y Case 1 deck(tempCard) = "A" Case 2 - 10 deck(tempCard) = y Case 11 deck(tempCard) = "J" Case 12 deck(tempCard) = "Q" Case 13 deck(tempCard) = "K" End Select Next Next Now once you have a deck you need a function that will tell you what suit it is based upon the number Public Function GetSuitbyNumber(cardNumber As Integer) As String Dim tempSuit As String = "" Select Case cardNumber Case 1 - 13 tempSuit = "Hearts" Case 14 - 26 tempSuit = "Diamonds" Case 27 - 39 tempSuit = "Clubs" Case 40 - 52 tempSuit = "Spades" End Select Return tempSuit End Function End Class Now since all your card numbers line up with your images, all you have to do when you need to load an image is to use the number of the deck card you want and the image and the value will line up. This is dirt simple I can make this much smaller but I wanted to make this as easy to understand as I can. I will leave it to you to track which cards have been used in the deck and how to randomize the "hands" or "deck" as you need. **Bone** 
Drag drop can be a bit of a bear. I would suggest your would have an easier time of this if you used the TreeView1_ItemDrag, the DataGrid1_DragEnter event, and the DataGrid1_Drop event. I am winging this from memory and a bit of googlefu so please ignore any typos or minor errors. The item drag object is shared between listview and treeview, so I cheat a bit and use the listview item type Private Sub TreeView1_ItemDrag(ByVal Sender As Object, ByVal e As ItemDragEventArgs) Handles TreeView1.ItemDrag Dim lvItem As ListViewItem lvItem = CType(e.Item, ListViewItem) 'Now we collect whatever important data we want. This could be an object or whatever in this case I am just grabbing the text. Dim importantData As String importantData = lvItem.Text ' OK. This is where we pass our data to the framework. Dim foo As DragDropEffects foo = ListView1.DoDragDrop(e.Item, DragDropEffects.Copy) ' The DoDragDrop method does not return until the drag and ' drop operation has completed. We display it for fun... debug.print(foo.ToString()) End Sub Secondly you will need to deal with the dragenter event on the DataGrid. This is where we check the types and gatekeep the drag drop event Private Sub DataGrid1_DragEnter(ByVal Sender As Object, ByVal e As DragEventArgs) Handles DataGrid1.DragEnter ' This event is fired when an item is dragged over the DataGrid1 object.

Let me know if you want anymore detail. 
ok this is good to illustrate how text to speech actually works and since it is open source we can go look at how it was done. Very cool.
Can't get the bullets to work to make it look better
Put the data into a dataset from the Excel file and set the datagridviews datasource property to the table it creates. Dim sFileName As String = txtImportFile.Text '"\someExcelFile.xlsx" Dim connectionStringTemplate As String = "Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;" &amp; _ "Data Source={0};" &amp; _ "Extended Properties=""Excel 12.0;" &amp; _ "HDR=Yes;IMEX=1""" Dim connectionString As String = String.Format(connectionStringTemplate, sFileName) Dim sqlSelect As String = "SELECT * FROM [Sheet1$]" ' Load the Excel worksheet into a DataTable Dim workbook As New DataSet Dim excelAdapter As System.Data.Common.DataAdapter = _ New System.Data.OleDb.OleDbDataAdapter(sqlSelect, connectionString) 'Try excelAdapter.Fill(workbook) ' Dim worksheet As DataTable = CType(workbook.Tables(0), DataTable) yourDataGridView.DataSource = workbook.Tables(0) 
So that I better understand, what part of that code gives the cards their numeric value so that the user's cards can be added and the computer's cards can be added? For example an ace needs to be worth 11 points. 
Because your array is 1-dimensional it will be more difficult to assign individual values to the card numbers stored in it. I would recommend creating a Card class [card.vb] to assign multiple properties to each card, and THEN create an array of "Card". Private Cards(51) As Card ' Array of the Card Class - 51 = 52 because array is zero based That will allow you to store numerous values to a 1-D array. :-) Public Class card Public Suit As String Public Number As Integer Public Points As Integer Public Text As String Public Sub New(CardSuit As String, CardNumber As Integer, CardPoints As Integer, Optional CardText As String = "") Suit = CardSuit Number = CardNumber Points = CardPoints Text = CardText End Sub End Class Once you have that you can create and add cards to the deck as others have shown above - the main difference being that you'll want to generate an instance of the card class for each index. Cards(0) = New card("Spades", 2, 2, "Two Of Spades") Other enhancements - You could add another string property to stored the image path "2ofSpades.png" or "C:\2ofSpades.png" and use that value to load the image when desired.
is there no way to make an array and give the cards point values that way? I don't think I understand this. My code now looks like this - Dim RandomCardPicker As New Random Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load 'Computer's Cards Labels Label3.Text = "" Label4.Text = "" Label5.Text = "" Label6.Text = "" Label7.Text = "" 'User's Cards Labels Label8.Text = "" Label9.Text = "" Label10.Text = "" Label11.Text = "" Label12.Text = "" 'Win, Lost, or tie label lblMessage.Text = "" End Sub Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Dim intComputersCardNumber, intComputersCardValue, intUsersCardNumber, intUsersCardValue, intComputerSecondValue, intComputerSecondNumber As Integer Dim Deck(52) As Integer Dim tempCard As Integer = 0 For x = 1 To 4 For y = 1 To 13 tempCard = tempCard + 1 Select Case y Case 1 Deck(tempCard) = "A" Case 2 - 10 Deck(tempCard) = y Case 11 Deck(tempCard) = "J" Case 12 Deck(tempCard) = "Q" Case 13 Deck(tempCard) = "K" End Select Next Next 'determin who won Dim User, Computer As Integer Computer = Val(CardOne) + Val(CardTwo) + Val(CardThree) + Val(CardFour) + Val(CardFive) User = Val(CardSix) + Val(CardSeven) + Val(CardEight) + Val(CardNine) + Val(CardTen) If Computer &gt; User Then lblMessage.Text = "User lost." loses = loses + 1 lblLost.Text = "lost: " &amp; loses End If End Sub End Class Public Class Card Private Cards(51) As Card Public Class card Public Suit As String Public Number As Integer Public Points As Integer Public Text As String Public Sub New(ByVal CardSuit As String, ByVal CardNumber As Integer, ByVal CardPoints As Integer, Optional ByVal CardText As String = "") Suit = CardSuit Number = CardNumber Points = CardPoints Text = CardText End Sub End Class End Class
Is there no way to convert a picture file to an integer? 
This is over his head for now man, its why I answered the question the way I did. Your way with the class is how I would do it myself but it needs to be done without objects me thinks.
There is no way that I am aware of to convert an integer to an image. to load all your pictures into an image array use something like this Dim cardImage(52) As Image For x = 1 To 52 cardImage(x) = Image.FromFile("{your path here}\" &amp; x.ToString &amp; ".png" Next
Here is how I would do it minus the interface stuff Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Dim deck(52) As Boolean Dim hands(10) As Integer Dim playerHand As Integer = 0 Dim cpuHand As Integer = 0 Dim tRandom As New Random For x = 1 To 10 Dim tCard As Integer = -1 Do Until tCard &gt; 0 tCard = tRandom.Next(1, 52) If deck(tCard) = True Then tCard = -1 Else deck(tCard) = True End If hands(x) = tCard Loop Next For x = 1 To 5 playerHand = playerHand + GetCardValuebyNumber(hands(x)) Next For x = 6 To 10 cpuHand = cpuHand + GetCardValuebyNumber(hands(x)) Next If playerHand &gt; cpuHand Then MsgBox("Player Wins!", vbOK) Else MsgBox("CPU Wins!", vbOK) End If End Sub to add an interface all you would have to do is put 5 image boxes on the top and 5 on the bottom. load each image from your stack of cards using image1.image = Image.FromFile("{your path here}\" &amp; hands(1).ToString &amp; ".png" image2.image = Image.FromFile("{your path here}\" &amp; hands(2).ToString &amp; ".png" etc... I am sure if I was not so sleepy I could figure out how to do that in the score calc loop. so you dont have to do it on each individual image box. 
sorry just noticed I missed the function for getting card value Public Function GetCardValuebyNumber(cardNumber As Integer) As Integer Dim tValue As Integer = 0 tValue = cardNumber Mod 13 If tValue = 0 Then tValue = 13 If tValue = 1 Then tValue = 11 ' its an ace change value to 11 Return tValue End Function
Here this is in my bag of tricks public sub DeleteFile(filePath as string) ' Check that file exists If Len(Dir$(filePath)) &gt; 0 Then ' Set attributes to normal so we don't get any readonly issues SetAttr filePath, vbNormal ' Delete the file Kill FilePath End If end sub **Bone**
Also, when in doubt, create a word file/document, select "Record a Macro", delete the file then look at the generated code. It'll give you a guide.
I did that but it showed only what I already know. It deletes the file from the known folder name. My problem is I am given a folder with a random name, so I need a macro that can find a file in the same folder as my active document without having any clue to the name or location of that folder in advance. The record feature sets it up in a way that would only work if it was going to always be in the same folder.
Since this is clearly homework, why don't you post what you have so far. Or did you just want someone to do your homework for you?
i dont want someone to do it for me. i just dont know what to do.
&gt; Open a file: Open app. path &amp; ”/filename.txt” for input as #1 Input #1 Close #1 Get this to work first.
Then you need to get the folder for the ActiveDocument This should be a property. Did you try the Object Browser?
Jim has it right start by opening and reading the file into variables. question: The input file with the students names can you cut and paste the first few lines of it for us? I can't tell how the file is delimited from your description. 
If I understand correctly, couldn't you create a timer with a for loop moving the pictureboxes every tick? Could you post your code?
Have you laid out your interface yet? The first thing to work on is opening and reading the file and getting the information into your program so you can manipulate it. [Reading text files](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/db5x7c0d.aspx) After that figure out how to split up the read in file into Name, and grades. Try and write this for a variable number of grades. Some user may have 3 grades and some may have 4 listed. [Splitting the information up using the **Split** command] (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6x627e5f.aspx) Once thats done then we can look at the [if structure](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/752y8abs.aspx) / [select case](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cy37t14y.aspx) structure to define the grade. then look at using [inputbox](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6z0ak68w.aspx) to get the teachers name and generate the code for them. using the [random function](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.Random.aspx) specifically rnd.next(100,999) Remember **Their are no wrong implementations for a program, only better ones** If you get it to work and you know why it is working then it is correct. 
Don't let this stuff eat you man, we get so many damn homework questions these days, all we can do is point them in the right direction and guide them.
**Removed Duplicate Thread** question was identical, user was deleted moved content here.
I am with billy on this one, I would use the system.drawing context but we need more info, to give you some direction.
What information do you have? if you don't know the name or location of the file how do you identify it?
There is a shared drive. A different department than my own creates a .doc file from html files they are given by an even different department. They add to it and put all their data (excel spreadsheets) into the document. Then they send it to my department for making it look nice. (I do the photoshop, graphics creation and stuff and also pagination so documents look neat and not like shit) When I started we had a checklist of about 40 things to be done when they send it to us. (change the margins, break all hyperlinks, change cell shading, change row and column widths, break all image links, etc). A lot of things to do to it. I started making macros for this so expedite the process instead of spending 20+ minutes per document. I now can do everything in one click of a button except delete the old file. The last thing I have to do is save it as a .docx file and remove the old .doc file. I am trying to find a way to delete the .doc without doing it manually. The folder that is placed on the drive is named a work order number that is generated by the other departments program. They send me an email that says: Job h00016278 is ready. I open the drive find the folder named that and inside is the .doc I need to work on. I have no prior knowledge of the folder name. This is why I am trying to find a way to write the macro so it goes to the folder that my active document is in and deletes any .doc inside. I know this sounds confusing.
how would i use the random function in this case? how can i get three digits, with the 1st one not being 0
Here you go; Dim rnd as new Random Dim NewNumber as integer = rnd.next(100,999) picks a number between 100 and 999 for more information see the Random Function from my previous post. 
OK I am following you now and Jim had it right :) try the [document.path](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff821867.aspx) property msgbox("ActiveDocument.Path &amp; Application.PathSeparator &amp; ActiveDocument.Name") will print out the full document path including the filename. then all you have to do is remove the docx from the end and change it to .doc and pass it to your delete function. 
you are right on the edge of this, what you need to do is store on a per picture box basis its last move and do that until it hits a border, calculate its move and then update its vector. I cheat for stuff like this, each imagebox has a tag property and I would store your last xVel and yVel in there as a comma separated value, then when I loop through I would apply the last x and y velocity to the object. When it hits the bounds I would randomize the next x/y velocity and place it in the tag property and wait for the next loop. lastly what is the thing you want to do becuase the system.graphics namespace is probably more what you want you can draw right on the form in any coulor animate the whole thing without having to use controsl which are very heavy for what you are doing. 
Oh, this is great help. Wish I could give you more than one upvote. So when I do this: MsgBox ActiveDocument.Path &amp; Application.PathSeparator &amp; _ ActiveDocument.Name It prints the name which is great If I add + .doc like so: MsgBox ActiveDocument.Path &amp; Application.PathSeparator &amp; _ ActiveDocument.Name + ".doc" I get Myfile.docx.doc I am currently trying to get it to remove the .docx portion so I can set up a kill commond with the path and .doc. I tried a few iterations of: MsgBox ActiveDocument.Path &amp; Application.PathSeparator &amp; _ ActiveDocument.Name -1 + ".doc" Haven't got it yet, I am not very good at this only started learning a few days ago. once I can get Myfile.docx to print as Myfile.doc I can delete it.
I am replying again to let you know that thanks to your help my issue is solved. The final answer was as follows: Sub DeleteFile() Dim j As Long j = InStrRev(ActiveDocument.FullName, ".") ToBeKilled = ActiveDocument.FullName ActiveDocument.SaveAs2 Replace(ActiveDocument.FullName, ActiveDocument.Name, "") + Mid(ActiveDocument.Name, 1, InStr(1, ActiveDocument.Name, ".") - 1) + ".docx", Word.WdSaveFormat.wdFormatDocumentDefault ActiveDocument.Close Kill ToBeKilled End Sub Saves as docx and deletes the old .doc without needing to know the name of the file, just through using the active document to find the path.
Thanks for the input, could you help illustrate with some coding? I understand what you mean with the system.graphics, I just don't understand how to make the objects move without having to use queing. Could you possibly help with making 3 objects' code with the movement possibly? Thank you for everything. Update: This is my code now using a for loop... not quite sure if it is right For Each PictureBox In formula Dim mybrush As New SolidBrush(Color.FromArgb(rnd.Next(255), 0, rnd.Next(255))) xvel = rnd.Next(-5, 0) yvel = rnd.Next(-5, 5) xball = rnd.Next(10, 25) yball = xball With formula(o) .Location = New Point(((rnd.Next(0, Panel1.Width / 2))), (rnd.Next(0, Panel1.Height - yball))) .Size = New Size(xball, yball) .BackColor = Color.FromArgb(rnd.Next(255), 0, rnd.Next(255)) End With formula(o).BackColor = Color.LimeGreen formula(o).Refresh() p = formula(o).CreateGraphics p.FillEllipse(mybrush, 0, 0, xball, yball) Next
you'd need to see if the acrobat reader has a command line flag you can use to print, or buy a 3rd party plugin.
What is a command line flag?
something like "reader.exe /print myfile.pdf", /print would be a flag. that's likely not the right exe or flag since I just made them up.
You're awesome, thank you!
Thanks guys for your replies especially bone! 
sorry but this is really unclear what you're asking. 
I apologize, I'm new so terminology isn't going to work. Okay, so on the tablix, you have your cells and what not and you can add a text box. I want to add a text box, put in it a function that will recall the date from the information it's pulling. the information is there, but I cannot type the actual date in otherwise whenever someone looks at it it's always going to be november. I need it to be dynamic. The query is a stored procedure...... I can paste that in here. DECLARE @StartDate DATETIME, @EndDate DATETIME SET @StartDate='11/6/2014' SET @EndDate='11/7/2014' EXEC dbo.lvs_SalesSummaryRpt @EndDate =@EndDate, @StartDate = @StartDate There are also two more data sets, one for weed, and one for month. They are the same query, just with modifications. DECLARE @StartDate DATETIME, @EndDate DATETIME SET @StartDate=DATEADD(wk, DATEDIFF(wk, 6, GETDATE()), 6) SET @EndDate=DATEADD(wk, DATEDIFF(wk, 6, GETDATE()), 12) EXEC dbo.lvs_SalesSummaryRpt @EndDate =@EndDate, @StartDate = @StartDate and this is the month one. DECLARE @StartDate DATETIME, @EndDate DATETIME SET @StartDate=CONVERT(VARCHAR(25),DATEADD(dd,-(DAY(GETDATE())-1),GETDATE()),101) SET @EndDate=DATEADD(s,-1,DATEADD(mm, DATEDIFF(m,0,GETDATE())+1,0)) EXEC dbo.lvs_SalesSummaryRpt @EndDate =@EndDate, @StartDate = @StartDate I hope that helps?
so use string concatenation on the label? I assume ssrs lets you do that. is ssrs VB based? I've never used it. if not, this doesn't seem like a VB question at all, but a SQL/ssrs one.
I only put it here because /r/ssrs is banned for some reason. (I'm sure it's because of some clever acronym.) har dee har. Vb wasn't a real thing, 6-8 members.
I will take a look after work man, it looks ok. You could always use the Tree view item type instead if the listview item is being a bear. Its odd I used a treeview when building the prototype.
IMO, creating a single class that contains the three values is the correct way to deal with this. Then you can just use List(of newClass), and List.Sort to sort it all together. 
alright! For X = 2 To 20 Step -2 here I'm declaring what range of values I want the cycle to return, and when to stop 20 being the max value and -2 so it returns them in order from less to more Range("A2:E2").Insert Here Im saying to VB which rows I'd like to be filled Do While X &lt;= 20 Range("A2") = X Range("B2") = X Range("C2") = X Range("D2") = X Range("E2") = X This is just so the machine knows X's value X = X * 2 now, why put a loop inside a for? So the program knows when to end the looping. Please, I beg you, this is what I have understood so far, I can't stand my teacher she's such a hideous person. My exam is tomorrow! thanks in advance 
Two ways come to mind. Create a List(of Button) and add each button to the list as you add it to the controls collection. or Add an id of some sort to the Button.Tag property, and then loop the Me.Controls collection looking for the control (using the .tag as an id). 
Ok i will try the tagging solution Ok I dont really understand the tag system So im gonna try the list one
 buttonlist.Add(mybutton) this gives us all the buttons in a single list, how can i split this list into nice little arrays, since i have 6 rows it would be nice to be able to use buttonlist(5,4) instead of buttonlist(103) as it is right now. I´ve tried adding indices to buttonlist but that makes them to a generic list that cant handle the other list.
If you are always going to have the same number of items, then you can use a two dimensional array. dim buttons(x,y) as button &lt; x and y represent rows and columns of buttons then instead of adding the button, you'd set the button to the correct coordinates. buttons(x,y) = mybutton &lt; do this for each button as you add it, placing it into the correct row and column. Then you'll be able to call into the correct one. Be aware that this will keep the button "alive" even when you remove it from the screen. 
Want to what! =p Atm I'm using dispose top get rid of the buttons, is that enough? 
Sorry ... meant to remove that part .. You'll need to remove the button from the form via Me.Controls.remove (buttons(x,y)), and then you could dispose it. 
So is this a console app or is it a forms app that watches a console process? **Bone**
What about converting the IsCorrect array to a list(boolean). Then you can loop the IsCorrect list, returning false the first time you find a false. If you get to the end and haven't found a false one, then you know they all passed. 
I may have gone a little crazy and done stuff way out of line. But in any case, the best way to do it would be to make sure that everything returns valid data first before adding anything to textboxes or totals. Only once you're certain that they're all valid should you add them all to total and textboxes. --- It looks like you're using a Function as a Sub. Generally you want a function to only return a value and not do anything with changing forms or message boxes. That would be a good time to use Sub. Also a good practice is to not duplicate code so you can create a generic function that you can pass variables to and it will output the answer you want. You may want to use it as an actual function with an output and pass it variables and assign the return to a variable and if THAT throws an error then you can stop the whole block. You want to make sure they all return values before adding any of them so you need to check them all first. Something like this. Try 'You want to put everything that could cause an error and anything you want to stop processing as a result of that error in the Try Catch block 'Define the temporary variables that will hold the answer that you will recall if none of them throw errors Dim tempA, tempB, tempC as Decimal tempA= CalcClassRev(CInt(txtClassA.txt),IntA_PRICE, "A") tempB= CalcClassRev(CInt(txtClassB.txt),IntB_PRICE, "B") tempC= CalcClassRev(CInt(txtClassC.txt),IntC_PRICE, "C") 'If the code gets here then none of functions returned errors 'Moved these from the function out of it because you don't want to change forms from a function and you don't know if you want to add to the total until you find out that they are all valid 'Do this for A B and C txtClassARev.Text = decClassARev.ToString("C2") decClassATot += decClassARev Catch ex As Exception If ex.Message = "Missing Data" Then MessageBox.Show("Please enter number of tickets for Class " &amp; ex.InnerException.Message, "Missing Data") ElseIf ex.Message = "Non-numeric data" Then MessageBox.Show("Please enter a numeric value for Class " &amp; ex.InnerException.Message &amp; " tickets", "Non-numeric data") End If End Try Function CalcClassRev(ByVal intClass as Integer, ByVal int_PRICE as Integer, ByVal strClassLetter as String) As Decimal Dim decClassRev As Decimal If txtClassA.Text = "" Then ' If it's blank then you want to tell them and then throw an exception to the top 'For Exceptions you can go as deep as you want, the first parameter is the message you want returned when it throws an exception, which in this case is "Missing Data" so it knows which message box to show. ' The second parameter is just creating a new exception inside the exception so it's an InnerException. You can keep going and create more but it gets confusing quick. The inner exception here is just the class letter for generic message box purposes. 'Throw means that it's going to exit the entire function and return an error to the calling function and catch it up there Throw New Exception("Missing Data", New Exception(strClassLetter)) Else Try 'intClassA = CInt(txtClassA.Text) -- This is not needed anymore since it's given as a parameter decClassRev = intClass * int_PRICE 'decClassATot += decClassARev -- Move this out since it is returned as the value Catch Throw New Exception(strClassLetter, New Exception("Non-numeric data")) End Try End If Return decClassRev End Function 
I was thinking the same thing except you don't even need to convert it to a list. You can just do For i as Integer = 1 to answers.count if isCorrect(i)=false then return False Next Return True --- If you don't need to check the isCorrect variable anymore in the function then technically you don't need it at all. You could just incorporate it into the first loop and the entire code would look like this Dim answers() As String = Split(answerid, ",") For x = 1 To answers.Count If IsCorrectSingleCheck(controlID, answers(x)) = False Then Return False Next Return True 
Essentially, when you return an AND boolean, you get true iff all results are true, and false otherwise. Following this logic, we can write a loop like so to replace your select case: For n = 1 to answers.count If isCorrect(n) = False then return false Next Return true EDIT: Actually hdrob is right, it's better to just return false at the first instance of false instead of continuing to loop. Altered code to reflect that. 
Yeah, this. Even if you don't want to use list.sort (because writing that can be tricky sometimes), it should be trivial to write a custom function to sort a list of objects for you based on whatever sorting algorithm you choose to use. 
It's a forms app that watches a console process. It's a gui front end for a command line only application. The problem is there is no way to stop this application from running unless you exit from it. However, if I run it from the command line, if I press Ctrl + C, it halts the process without the need to exit. So I'm trying to make it where I can press a button on the gui and it sends this "ctrl+c" command to the command line app and causes it to halt it's process, without having to exit the program and restart it.
I'm pretty sure that properties on the group can only apply to new items added in the group. you have to do a loop to modify the existing ones.
I ended up using the 2nd option. Thanks again. **Bone**
my teacher assigned me to use both for and do loops, I gave it another try. watcha think bout it? Dim X As Integer For X = 2 To 20 Step 2 Range("A2:E2").Insert Do While X &lt;= 20 Range("A2") = X Range("B2") = X Range("C2") = X Range("D2") = X Range("E2") = X X = X + 2 Loop Next X I remember my friend declared another variable in his code, you think that's the missing link? EDIT: Ok, I figured out something. I haven't specified X's value, so I put Y = 2 Private Sub boton_Click() Dim X As Integer Dim Y As Integer For X = 2 To 2 Step 20 Range("A2:E2").Insert Do While X &lt;= 20 Range("A2") = X Range("B2") = X Range("C2") = X Range("D2") = X Range("E2") = X X = Y * 2 Loop Next X unfortunately this crashes excel 
Keep system time in sync with a time server?
dude, I feel like you're throwing poo at it and seeing what sticks. step back and think about what the values are as the code would run. "for x=2 to 2" is never going to run at all. "x=y*2" y is never assigned so it's zero by default, so you're resetting X to 0 every time. this part isn't even programming, it's just middle/high school pre-algebra. maybe you're supposed to do it twice, once with for and once with while? there's no way to accomplish the task using both at once.

This would be a better discussion for /r/java or r/javahelp. 
do you have any databases that your company uses in house. Do something more useful like count number of customers per day, or graph stats on a chart, doing something that can be pitched to be used is better.
just a suggestion... enter the code into the IDE and test it?
A: you have to figure out the logic of the code snippet. If score = 90, where does the code flow to? What will the output be? If score is 80, where does the code flow to? It should be fairly straightforward if you think about it for a bit. B: What does the .IndexOf method do? C: I'll give you a hint. If (tbNumber Mod 2) = 0 then tbNumber is even; otherwise it's odd. D: I'm not sure what problem you're having with this question.

I think you have a couple problems. First, for the problem you are asking. The reason why you are outputting letters on each line is because of that for loop. You are looping through each letter of Name and assigning each letter to its respective array. Now the for the problem you probably don't see. I think you are assigning the name to above/below average too early. The reason being, you are doing it while you are still looping through the records. Which means you didn't get the actual average yet. You should be doing your math first, then evaluating if each record is above or below average. 
For anyone using this as a reference in the future, I'd just like to note that this method uses an exclusive upper bound. This means using the code provided would generate 998 as the highest random number. 
foofin is right I normally do rnd.next(99,999) +1 Good catch man 
&gt; for instance, some way to make the validator functions also operate as string or integer data returns. What would you have it return if it were to return a string? For this section you could use String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(testString) and combine the first and last into one. &gt; If StrStudentName = Nothing Then MessageBox.Show("ERROR N1: you have not entered a name", "Name Validator System") Return False 'person put a number instead of a word ElseIf IsNumeric(StrStudentName) = True Then MessageBox.Show("ERROR N2: That is not an Acceptable user name", "Name Validation System") Return False 'user enter blank spaceive ElseIf (StrStudentName = "") Or (StrStudentName = " ") Or (StrStudentName = " ") Then MessageBox.Show("ERROR N3: You have entered Empty Space for a Name", "Name Validator System") Return False End If ___ In this section: &gt; BooValidator = False Do Until BooValidator = True StrStudentName = InputBox("Please Enter a Student Name", "Name Input") 'checks are done here, values are reviewed and Bool is switched accourdingly If InputNameValidator(StrStudentName) = True Then BooValidator = True Else BooValidator = False End If Loop ' name input loop close Do Until (StrGradeInputControl = "N") Or (StrGradeInputControl = "n") 'Grade input loop system primary BooValidator = False 'reset bool Do Until BooValidator = True 'assignment and Error check for string grade type StrGradeType = InputBox("Please Enter the Number type for the Grade (0 for Quiz, 1 for Assignment and 2 for Exam)", "Grade Labler") If GradeTypeValidator(StrGradeType) = True Then BooValidator = True Else BooValidator = False End If Loop ' loop close for Grade source BooValidator = False 'reset bool, run grade entry validation and loop Do Until BooValidator = True 'new grade assignment StrNewGrade = InputBox("Please Enter the Student Grade", "Grade Input") 'checks are done here, values are reviewed and Bool is switched accourdingly If InputGradeValidator(StrNewGrade) = True Then BooValidator = True Else BooValidator = False End If For every instance of If &lt;somethingValidator&gt; = True Then BooValidator = True Else BooValidator = False End If You can change that to BooValidator = &lt;somethingValidator&gt; or if you really wanted to Do Until &lt;somethingValidator&gt; = True Loop If you have any specific sections you would like looked at I can do that. What sections of your code do you like? Or is it just in general the whole thing?
 Dim password As String = "m0nekey" Dim newPassword As String = "" Dim vowels As Char() = {"a", "e", "i", "o", "u"} Dim vowelCount As Integer = 0 For index As Integer = 0 To password.Length - 1 Dim currentCharacter As Char = password.Substring(index, 1) If vowels.Contains(currentCharacter) Then If vowelCount &lt; 10 Then vowelCount += 1 newPassword &amp;= vowelCount ElseIf IsNumeric(currentCharacter) = True Then newPassword &amp;= "Z" Else newPassword &amp;= currentCharacter End If Next At the end, newPassword = mZn1k2y
Thank you!!! You are a life saver!
Why loop through the list at all just use linq to call .Any on the collection using and pass it the predicate you want to match. Its an easy one liner solution to this problem 
The only suggestion I can make is not to use ftp but sftp since ftp transmits data totally unencrypted.
(1.5) + wage is wrong. Should be * wage. You had it right in the calculate pay sub. Then you changed it. 
Yes, I do. Feel free to PM me your questions.
Your problem isn't the if/elseif statement. It's an operator issue. Hint: The "&amp;" operator is used to concatenate two strings. There's also another error in your code that would cause you to not have any value for lblGrade.Text if the total is between 260 and 269 ;)
Does lblGrade.Text have an initial value? If so, and its initial value is "A" then that would explain why its value is "A" when the total is 260 - you don't have a case in the if statement that handles this value, so presumably the value of lblGrade.Text never changes. EDIT: manually correcting autocorrect.
No there's no initial value. The value becomes whatever I type instead of "A" on the code.
If you've got any more, don't hesitate to pm me.
You already have the range specified correctly. Just replace the &amp; operator with the 'and' operator. If total.Text &gt;= 270 and total.Text &lt;= 300 Then
To elaborate on why your code always returned "A": The &amp; operator concatenates two strings, and it will try its hardest to convert the two operands on either side of it into strings. So, let's say you have total.Text = 300. Your code would effectively be: If total.Text &gt;= "270300" &lt;= 300 Then The &amp; took the integer 270 and turned it into a string, then took the value of total.Text "300", then combined them. Now, you might think 'but why would it return "A"? total.Text surely isn't equal to or greater than 270300!' However, when you compare strings it compares them based on each character in order from left to right. The first character from total.Text's value is "3" and the first character from "270300" is "2". So "3" &gt;= "2" evaluates to true, which gave you the grade "A". The same thing was happening when you tried changing the value to 260. "2" &gt;= "2' would also be true. Anyway, I know that was a lot of information, but I hope it helps you understand the code better. :) edit: formatting
Now I better understand how &amp; works. I really appreciate this.
Update: downloaded MySQL and am attempting to run the BP testing server. will have more news later
You have to assign the return value of `MessageBox.Show()` to `result`. Private Sub btnClear_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnClear.Click Dim result As DialogResult = MessageBox.Show("Are you sure you want to empty your list?", "Clearing", MessageBoxButtons.YesNo) If result = DialogResult.Yes Then ListBox1.Items.Clear() End If End Sub
I highly recommend you look into using some sort of Source Control. I believe you can integrate Git into VB 2012. My solution for you right now is to create a new project and copy the resources.resx file into your exisiting project. 
I do.
O wow, I guess I knew that but I never thought of what that means to my everyday code. I have been stuck in the mindset of LINQ = Database. This is going to take a while for me to work this into my mindset. Thank you very helpful. **Bone**
Yeah it's pretty groundbreaking when you first start using the IEnumerable Linq extensions for collections, it will make your code so much more maintainable. I use it so much it's not even funny, what really got me started using it was when I bought Resharper, instantly it started suggestion I convert all my ForEach's into Linq, if you get paid to write VB Code you have to buy Resharper. 
Modules are accessible to everything that includes that namespace. So you just have to call the method name in your form, when you add that namespace. So for instance. Namespace Foo Public Module Bar Public Function Baz() as String Return "Faz" End Function End Bar End Namespace can be called from a form like this. Imports Foo Public Class SomeClass Public Sub SomeMethodInThatClass() 'This will output Faz Console.Out.WriteLine(Baz()) End Sub End Class Also remember you can pass controls around to methods so something like Public Sub Bar(Dim control as TextBox) control.Text = "SomeText" End Sub 
This sounds just like a homework assignment. Instead of asking someone to do the homework for you, post what you've done and ask for pointers and help that way. 
Insert a break on the first line of code (click on the leftmost column of the line) and then press f5. Use f8 to run the code line by line. Where does the error occur?
Its saying that there is no source available. 
 End Class Is that supposed to be in there?
Yup.
Its not letting me take a sceenshot. The error reads "Invalid Operations Exception was unhandled" then it says "An error occurred creating the form. See Exception.InnerException for details. The error is: Object reference not set to an instance of an object." it also opens a new tab in my solution that says "No Source Available" and then "No symbols are loaded for any call stack frame. The source code cannot be displayed." 
I tried remaking the project, but it didn't work. Is there anything else I can try?
How do I clean the source code? I tried restarting it already.
Actually reading your comment below it sounds like you have a bug in your code.
I can see one problem you are trying to add 1 to label4.Text. label4.Text is a string you can't add 1 to that.
Your also setting Guess1 to textbox1.Text outside of a method which won't do what you think it does.
That shouldn't throw an error creating the form though. Sounds like something in the designer code is messing up.
True but with how the code is I'm sure the rest of the code is incorrect. We'd have to see all of it to tell.
Actually, it all worked fine until I added the code for the timer. It was the If Awnser1 = Guess1 Then tmcCounter.Enabled = False End If that stopped it. 
That is all of the code.
Have you started working on it gets? Is there a specific part you need help figuring out.
All the documentation for Visual Basic 2008 (and even older version) is still on Microsofts MSDN Library Site: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2x7h1hfk(v=vs.90).aspx
I always hate seeing these posts, it's like the teacher doesn't give a shit. There no way you should expect to work with file streams without a basic knowledge of what a variable is at the very least. I know this isn't helpful but I have to say something, I watched my brother and his friends get CS degrees and this was basically the same thing their teacher did, "Hi class this program is visual basic it let's you program, now go hit up google you need to build me a music store app by the end of the week". They would come to me as I was already established in the industry and ask for my help, the assignments were ridiculous for the amount of knowledge that had been given to them, the teacher should be shot with a ball of their own shit, no one learns or enjoys programming by being thrown in the deep end like that. 
This. Also it would be a good idea to pass data into the form for the number of controls and then have a for loop to create them. Just research Data Binding...or you could be lazy and use an external data file like a text file and parse it, but that wouldn't be smart.
This is not helpful man. i get that it's frustrating but don't just send them to google give them a resource for the start of the search.
Sorry dude I cant answer your question for in the text it states to use “header card” or the “trailer card” method. I have no clue what those are even after a google. [Declaring an Array](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wak0wfyt.aspx) is fairly straightforward. Since these are sales figures I am going to assume that you want a money value. A "Decimal " variable type allows for decimal values. so... Dim Quarter1() as Decimal This will store n number of variables for the quarter to set values you would use Quarter1(1) = 5.23 Quarter1(2) = 1.00 Quarter1(3) = 243.34 .... In the real world a list would be used; Dim quarter1 As List(Of Decimal) quarter1.Add(1) quarter1.Add(5.43) quarter1.Add(456.21) 'get sum Dim quarter1sum As Decimal = 0 For Each n In quarter1 quarter1sum += n ' this is the same as writing quarter1sum = quarter1sum + n Next ' Getting the sum can also be done by using the list sum function Dim Quarter1Sum as decimal = quarter1.sum() 'get average Dim quarter1average As Decimal = quarter1average / quarter1.Count ' Or the simpilar method Dim Quarter1Average as decimal = quarter1.average() Lastly I get the feeling since you posted this on stack exchange that this is homework so I have tagged it as such. Can you also post the text without the spaces in front or at least as a block so it is easier to read please.
Thank you both! I have been reading about these things for about 20 minutes now and this is exactly what I needed My search was too vague for a browser search. This helped immensely.
This is way too vague. Need to see some code or a specific question if you want any kind of helpful response.
Good job!
the first thing I see is you are rediming the array this clears it. So everytime you insert a line it will clear the array. These lines are not needed; Dim n = allPlayers.Count - 1 ReDim players(n) you should check for a null after you have run you query for a null is returned the rest of your code is borked. if query is nothing then msgbox("Player not found!") exit sub else ' rest of code here end if The LINQ looks good and datagrid looks ok. 
I have to agree it's not the best way of teaching. he's not told us much about VB what so ever other then like Data types and things of that nature.
Post your code.
