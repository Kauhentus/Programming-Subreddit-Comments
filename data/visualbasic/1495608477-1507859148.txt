Excellent. There're about 48 "elegant" ways to achieve the result, but you know what needs to be done!
I know OP has provided nothing, but it seemed like fun to do. Public Function IsPalindrome(Word As String) If IsNothing(Word) Then Throw New ArgumentNullException() Dim StringLength As Integer = Word.Length If (StringLength = 0) Then Throw New ArgumentException() Word = Word.ToUpper() For i As Integer = 0 To StringLength - 1 If Word.Substring(i, 1) &lt;&gt; Word.Substring(StringLength - i - 1, 1) Then Return False Next Return True End Function
Thanks, I o u one maman, ill sauce u the finished product.
Whoever down-voted this is a dick head. We need more posts like this and less homework.
Can you please clarify if this is vb.net? I mean it looks like it but why would anyone use call or random like that. But in regards to your problem, do i understand you correct, you want to make sure that a tip is only shown once and not again after that? But it has to be a random order of tips? In this case it is a little more complicated. On programmstart i would take all the tips and put them in a list in a random order, then whenever the button is clicked show the next element from this list. If the list ends, show the first tip again. 
i agree, it was fun :) i skipped the loop requirement because i wanted to have it as a fancy one liner Private Shared Function isPalindrome(pText As String) As Boolean 'take string, to lowercase, compare it to itself reversed, if same then palindrome Return String.Equals(pText.ToLower, New String(pText.Reverse.ToArray).ToLower) End Function
If we're going for short and no loop, this was the best I could come up with. Public Function IsPalindrome(Word As String) Return UCase(Word) = StrReverse(UCase(Word)) End Function Edit: Ok, so I took a look at the raw IL for your method and mine. Turns out, using String.Equals uses 1 less stack frame vs using the = sign directly. Public Function IsPalindrome(Word As String) As Boolean Word = UCase(Word) Return String.Equals(Word, StrReverse(Word)) End Function Color me surprised. Revising this code to only call UCase once reduces the instruction size by 31%.

Thanks, we need your appreciations as well.
Are you using objects to populate the DGV? Ideally you'd bind a bindingList(of SomeClass) to the DGV (rather than manipulating the DGV directly). Then you could write simple routine that could populate one type of object from the other, and loop through the list of items that's bound to DGV1, and convert them to a new DGV2 object, and add them to the list of items that's bound to DGV2. 
No problem. Keep in mind most of the classes you use in code now make use of project level imports (versus code file level imports you asked about). These are imports that are set in the project properties, and many are setup by default when you create a new project. That is why in a windows forms project you can say Dim myForm as Form and not need to say Dim myForm as System.Windows.Forms.Form because the system.windows.forms namespace is a project wide import done for you. There are some other more advanced things you can do with imports, like using aliases on them, but generally it is pretty rare to get into situations that make sense to use that.
what do you mean previous? that last time the button was clicked? you can make intTotalRooms static or global. if you need a way to reset it, global will be less weird. 
Well, I moved intTotalRooms to global, but still nothing. It should be doing the following(example from the assginment; Floor: 1, Rooms Occupied : 22 Total Rooms : 22 Floor: 2, Rooms Occupied : 30 Total Rooms : 53 Floor: 3, Rooms Occupied : 0 Total Rooms : 53 Floor: 4, Rooms Occupued : 25 Total Rooms : 77 Instead, it is doing the following; Floor: 1, Rooms Occupied : 22 Total Rooms : 22 Floor: 2, Rooms Occupied : 30 Total Rooms : 30 Floor: 3, Rooms Occupied : 0 Total Rooms : 0 Floor: 4, Rooms Occupued : 25 Total Rooms : 25 
This particular assignment is supposed to prompt the user to enter the number of occupied rooms for each floor in the hotel using an InputBox. You would use a loop and then display the results in a ListBox.
&gt; It should be doing the following(example from the assginment; &gt; Floor: 1, Rooms Occupied : 22 Total Rooms : 22 &gt; Floor: 2, Rooms Occupied : 30 Total Rooms : 53 &gt; Floor: 3, Rooms Occupied : 0 Total Rooms : 53 &gt; Floor: 4, Rooms Occupued : 25 Total Rooms : 77 &gt; Instead, it is doing the following; &gt; Floor: 1, Rooms Occupied : 22 Total Rooms : 22 &gt; Floor: 2, Rooms Occupied : 30 Total Rooms : 30 &gt; Floor: 3, Rooms Occupied : 0 Total Rooms : 0 &gt; Floor: 4, Rooms Occupued : 25 Total Rooms : 25 OMG, That worked. Thank you!
Just from reading the documentation for that method, I can see the first and second arguments are wrong. The first argument is supposed to be an enumeration value, not the number of rows. The second is supposed to be a bookmark not a row number. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ado/reference/ado-api/getrows-method-ado 
thanks. i edited my question to show the answer as an aside, the end goal is to get a string of ids. i see that the array returned by the function is the 'wrong' way around, i.e. instead of x rows and one column in my array (where x = rst.recordcount), i get 1 row and x columns. i guess that because of this i can't use the join function without a loop? the whole point of using getrows was to avoid looping through the recordset, but there's no point if i just have to loop through the array returned!
cboFloors.SelectedIndex += 1 Though you have to make sure you are not exceeding the actual number of items in the combobox or you will get an outOfRange exception.
Best I can suggest is to look for old books. http://hackipedia.org/Books/Visual%20Basic%206%20Black%20Book.pdf 
You'll have to start over. Going between modern VB and C# is easy, but going back to VB6 is entirely different. For example, the memory model is completely different. You have to understand reference counting and cycles, but you don't have to worry about calling Dispose. So forget everything you know about .NET and treat it like an alien language.
Well i'm doomed then.
I think we need to figure out what language you're using first. Is this VB6 (in Visual Studio), VB Script (a VBS file), or something else?
I'ts a little company in Argentina that sells an ERP thats made on vb6, yeah, can't find another job as a junior for now :(
it is a VB Script .vbs file I found [here](http://winaero.com/blog/desktop-wallpaper-context-menu-windows-10/)
So instead of the last line (CreateObject("Wscript.shell")...... ) replace it with this: Set filesys = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject") filesys.DeleteFile sContents

Meh a lot of companies have legacy software.
Yeah my problem was that the DGV2 had columns that wasn't in 1 so when it then tried to save DGV2 with my SQL query i had null values attempting to paste into cells that didn't allow not null.
Via String.Substring(startIndex, length) Dim s As String = "G-01" s = s.Substring(2, 2)
Thanks a bunch. Somehow search only turned up all the trims and lefts rights. I assume if I want to use that in a loop i need to convert it? 
.NET by default is able to cast such a string directly into an integer, of course with the "loss" of the prefix zero. For i As Integer = 0 To "G-01".Substring(2, 2) Next Replace the explicit string with any hard-coded string or a string variable. EDIT: Still, be careful with these casts. Look into CInt() or Integer.TryParse() for more information on how to do that.
Thanks. Yah I am used to javascript which is like a cheap whore you can do everything you like to. I am comparing with what a friend told me of course. 
&gt; I want something that stops at the breakpoint and when you execute again starts over and stops at the same breakpoint again. When breakpoint hits, just click restart instead of continue? Kind of curious why you want this behavior.
starts what over? the whole program?
Yeah sorry, I just assumed you used .NET, that deprecated the Left, Mid and Right commands. For older versions, Mid should work just fine.
If you have Option Strict on (you should always have Option Strict on) this won't work (you'll have to convert the string half before you can use it). 
This code works ok for me. One change I would recommend is to do the check for Integer before changing to an integer. This line will fail before your test. intRooms = CInt(txtRooms.Text) 
So how would I fix it?
I have this code running in my environment and it works as you expect.
Ok, so you want to use the dropdown list OR type the floor number into the combobox? Use this: ' Collect the floor and room data from the inputs If cboFloors.SelectedIndex = -1 And cboFloors.Text &lt;&gt; "" Then If IsNumeric(cboFloors.Text) Then intFloor = CInt(cboFloors.Text) End If Else intFloor = CInt(cboFloors.SelectedItem) End If 
Just the dropdown list and not typing anything
 Dim n As Integer = 1 ' set to a default of 1 Dim x As Integer = Rnd() ' choose a random number between 0 and 1 If x = 0 Then n *= -1 ' if x = 0 then flip the default to negative (Hint: n is the value you want to output, not x)
 Dim n As Integer = 1 ' set to a default of 1 Randomize() ' seed the Rnd function with the system timer Dim x As Integer = Rnd() ' choose a random number between 0 and 1 If x = 0 Then n *= -1 ' if x = 0 then flip the default to negative 
 If x = 0 then do it again 
When I run it, it seems to only go one way, it goes randomly at first and the just goes in the same direction every time.
What are you trying to do? 
Have a label that moves in one random direction on timer tick. I want the direction to stay constant though.
When you initialize the form: labelDirectionDeltaX = multiplier1 labelDirectionDeltaY = multiplier2 Then, inside the Timer1.tick: Lable1.Top += labelDirectionDeltaY Lable2.Left += labelDirectionDeltaX 
Alright I'll get back to you.
Take my upvote anyway.
Hey second try with just vb! Dim x as variant Dim y as integer x = array(-1,1) y = x(rnd()) This assumes that \u\rudekoffenris is correct that rnd() returns 0 or 1 at random
It sets up the direction the label heads in OUTSIDE the timer.tick function. That way the direction isn't changed every tick.
So am I making labeldirectiondeltax = multiplier in the form load?
This isn't working? cboFloors.SelectedIndex += If(cboFloors.SelectedIndex &lt; 7, 1, 0)
It is adding 1 to the SelectedIndex if the index is less than 7 in that line though correct?
What are you trying to do? I can't get behind it. But do you know the modulo operator? Maybe this is what you are looking for?
Set properties and still have same result. I have tried different combinations of these properties with all returning the same results. This is why I have tried doing it with code instead of the date picker properties.
Because I wanted to make sure that the code above it wasn't causing the problem. The code above that is setting the date of my pickers to the current date upon form load. I have removed the code completely as well. 
Someone has already mentioned the Random problem... Using random, you can also cut down the code required to get a random letter: Dim random = New System.Random ' use only one of these Dim consonants As String = "bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz" Dim randomConsonant = consonants(random.next(consonants.Length)) The last line is all that you need to get a random letter from that string.
Change Dim sqlDate As String = datePickerFrom.Value.ToShortDateString To Dim sqlDate As String = datePickerFrom.Value.Date.ToShortDateString Maybe even add a Console.WriteLine(sqlDate) right after it to verify that the sqlDate string is set correctly before it concatenates in to the query string. Also, parameterize your queries!
Tried this too. Currently I changed the sqlDate to a DateTime so maybe I could convert directly after assigning the value of sqlDate but this didn't work either. I added some pictures to show where I am currently at. This is very frustrating.
Okay, now that I fixed it, how do I make sure 8th floor does not repeat? currently, it's going floor 1 | floor 7 floor 8 floor 8 floor 8
What would you like it to do besides going to the 8th floor again? Do you want it to go back to 1? 
This'll help with day of week. there's a vb example there that you can shoehorn into your little app :) https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.DayOfWeek.aspx 
Sounds like a plan. I'll run that later and report back. Thanks for the help!
So what you are saying from your last edit is that you made the code '6/2/2017' and it is changing it to '6/1/2017 1:28:28 PM'. Am I reading that right? what happens if you put a break on the next line after the dim (conn.ConnectionString = strConn) and look at the sqlcommand value?
I am not exactly sure if this is what you need but maybe it helps: Public Class MainClass Private mySubClass1 As SubClass1 = Nothing Public ReadOnly Property SubClass1 As SubClass1 Get If mySubClass1 Is Nothing Then mySubClass1 = New SubClass1(Me) Return mySubClass1 End Get End Property Private mySubClass2 As SubClass2 = Nothing Public ReadOnly Property SubClass2 As SubClass2 Get If mySubClass2 Is Nothing Then mySubClass2 = New SubClass2(Me) Return mySubClass2 End Get End Property Public Sub New() System.Diagnostics.Debug.Print("Hello from " &amp; SubClass1.Name) System.Diagnostics.Debug.Print("Hello from " &amp; SubClass2.Name) End Sub End Class Public Class SubClass1 Private myMainClassHandle As MainClass = Nothing Private myName As String = "SubClass1" Public ReadOnly Property Name As String Get Return myName End Get End Property Public Sub New(ByRef pMainClass As MainClass) myMainClassHandle = pMainClass End Sub End Class Public Class SubClass2 Private myMainClassHandle As MainClass = Nothing Private myName As String = "SubClass2" Public ReadOnly Property Name As String Get Return myName End Get End Property Public Sub New(ByRef pMainClass As MainClass) myMainClassHandle = pMainClass End Sub End Class Here you have a Mainclass, 2 different sub classes with a different property name and a reference to the parent class. If you use it like this: Dim Main As New MainClass System.Diagnostics.Debug.Print(Main.SubClass1.Name) you should get the following output: Hello from SubClass1 Hello from SubClass2 SubClass1 (The first two hellos are from the constructor of the main class, also the subclasses are loaded 'lazy', means they are created the first time they are needed. This is sometimes useful, sometimes not) I feel i should also say that there is no single correct way, it always depends on the circumstances and your goal (readability, maintainability ... )
Yeah worked a bit with those already. :) Just first time I had so much different data to pull from the same object that I was losing track, so having to split up code into multiple classes is something new to work with. Felt I was doing it wrong (and I was), hence the question. Thanks for getting me back on track.
You're welcome, Have fun writing! Oh and btw, do you know [namespaces](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/namespaces)? Thats also a feature helping with structured code. 
I found https://www.youtube.com/user/VBToolbox/playlists a useful tool when starting out.
Looking at this again, I have a few more questions. It seems I almost got it right first time before posting, but I was missing some parts to this. If I read this right: *You created 2 "random" new classes, no link to the main class *You named them with lower case for variables, but due to returning them via the readOnly it appears as upperCase outside and with a generic name, and no () at the function call. *You keep these classes hidden outside the class, but allows a readOnly reference to them so they can not be replaced from outside this code. *The readOnly property does not prevent changes from functions within the subclass, only the reference too the subclass. *You make the object immuteable, so they are created only if needed. (standard tradeoffs with an immuteable object could be considered) *You pass the main class along too the subclasses so they can reference functions/variables *If you want to share variables/objects only with these subclasses you would make the variables protected. (and have these classes be in their own namespace) Please let me know if I understood this correct, and if not what I missed :)
Hi - thanks. I should have mentioned I've tried this also, the issue remains in that the command is still apparently sent without them.
what if you put the pull command in start-&gt;run? or from a cmd window? I've not tried powershell like this, but most things require the command itself to be quoted, or prefixed in some way
Sorry for using unclear terminology. By link I was referring to some special construct in the language for "SubClasses", which is not the case. It is just standard classes (used in a specific pattern.) As for the capitalization part. I disliked naming a variable with caps, and did not consider returning the class via a method call. And I agree with the direct access. But I still do not understand what the difference with returning the class via a Readonly over a Function. Private myClass as SubClass1 = New SubClass1 Public Readonly Property Message as SubClass1 Get return myClass End Get End Property vs Private myClass as SubClass1 = new SubClass1 Public Function Property Message as SubClass1 Get return myClass End Get End Property Sorry reading the Readonly and simply unable to understand what difference it is when you return something as a class that is different. If I return a class as a Readonly and call a function that should update data, is it updating on a "seperate" object. e.g. The initial text to return is "Original Text" mainclass.Subclass1.UpdateVariableReadOnly("Hello World") System.Diagnostics.Debug.Print(mainclass.Subclass1.GetText) would write this due to the readonly making the call to a new object copy and the updates to it is lost between the update and the print "Original Text" While: Dim tmpObject as Object = mainclass.Subclass1 tmpObject.UpdateVariableReadOnly("Hello World") System.Diagnostics.Debug.Print(tmpObject.Subclass1.GetText) System.Diagnostics.Debug.Print(mainclass.Subclass1.GetText) would output (you retrieve the object "copy" and update its values, print it, but when you make the second output you again refer to the non updated object). "Hello World" "Original Text"
Yeah...the error message was too generic to tie this down much. As you mentioned, thousands of different possibilities. That said, I did just discover something that may help me narrow down the google results. This error only happens in Office 2016. Same steps in Office 2010 or 2013, no problems. Even took a fresh Office 2016 install on a PC that had not yet joined the domain (so no group polices in the mix)...same error. Thanks for the suggestion of /r/vba , I'll try there.
&gt; which is a variable, and should be non caps. Why do you think it should be non caps? Not trying to criticize, but i don't see a reason for this rule. 
Thats fine with me, as we already established earlier this is mainly pure personal preference. My way is private variables start with my and otherwise i just capitalize every new word

Yes, "This is for web." That one sentence changes the programming paradigm for everything. Basically means your program is split between client side and server side development. I despise, "This is for web."

in the sub winlose() it makes a label appear and a button that on button click starts timer and makes label/button hide
!!!Again: Format your code here on reddit correctly, it is a pain to read it that way!!! Still, I think that you did not put the two labels that you ask if they intersect to a new location. As to your style of coding: Sorry, but terrible and inefficient. Copy Pasting code lines that differ only in consecutive numbers can mostly be written in loops. Rename your lblControl into lblColour7 and try the following: Dim backColourRnd(6) as Integer Dim rnd as new Random For i = 0 to 6 backColourRnd = rnd.Next(1, 7) Next winClose() For i = 0 to 6 Dim currLabel as Label = Me.Controls("lblColour" &amp; i) currLabel.BackColor = getColor(i) currLabel.Text = i Next The function that "converts" an integer to the corresponding color: Private Function getColor(ByVal rndInt as Integer) as Color Select Case rndInt Case 1: Return Color.Red Case 2: Return Color.Orange Case 3: Return Color.Yellow Case 4: Return Color.Purple Case 5: Return Color.Green Case 6: Return Color.Blue Case Else: Return Color.Black End Select End Function
&gt; everything but the label is able to move You pretend that I am as immersed into your code as you are and immediately know what "label" you mean, but I do not.
That's the point where debugging comes into play. Check if your moveLeft variable is set to true, if the keyUp Event gets even called etc. I cannot help you there.
Thanks!
Made my night. More people need to witness this.
&gt; reportlocks - Every 0.3 seconds, break the screenshot up into small chunks and analyze each one to see if they contain over 30 but less than 40 pixels with a brightness value over 98%. Have you thought about finding the white dot with your technique and as soon as you have it switch the approach to more "tracking style"? So if you found it, you remember it was on coordinates X, Y and from this point in time you check more often (if possible) but only have to analyse a significantly smaller area around the last known coordinates. This should also minimize false positives 
What you've typed makes sense but when I change Public Sub V_CheckedChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles V.CheckedChanged If V.Checked = True Then Dim V As Integer V = 1 Else Dim V As Integer V = 0 End If End Sub To Public Sub V_CheckedChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles V.CheckedChanged If V.Checked = True Then Public V As Integer V = 1 Else Public V As Integer V = 0 End If End Sub I get an error saying error "BC30247: 'Public' is not valid on a local variable declaration." EDIT: Now that I've added Private Sub changeV(ByRef V As Integer) Form2.V = V End Sub Into form 3, for the V in "Form2.V = V" I'm getting an error saying "error BC30311: Value of type 'Integer' cannot be converted to 'CheckBox'." And the V in If (V = 1) Then Vvlabel.Text = Vv + Vv End If Is getting an error saying "error BC30451: 'V' is not declared. It may be inaccessible due to its protection level."
Please post screenshots of the code for both forms, I am not up to date anymore
&gt;checkhp - take a screenshot, start looking at the area where the hp bar should be, and count how many pixels right you go before encountering a non-red pixel. You can speed this up by using a binary search instead of a linear one. If you know the length of the HP bar, you can 1st check at 50%, then if it's filled, you check 75% and so on until you find the spot where it ends. If the hp bar is 300 pixels, you'll need only 9 checks at most to find. Same thing will apply to the boss HP, and help even more since it tends to be very long.

You are an absolute legend, it worked. Thank you so much for all your help. I'm sorry for all the confusion, this is my first time using VB without a tutorial and my teacher at school is hopeless... knew I could trust reddit. 
That's some serious voodoo you're doing in Form1.vb. I like it. I've done a lot with frame grabbing in the past, I'll have to track down my code to remember what worked best. How are you doing it?
&gt; function checklockon I downloaded the entire solution but I'm not finding that function anywhere. 
`Bitmap.GetPixel` is really slow, and you're creating loads of bitmaps for every call. It would be much faster to use `Bitmap.LockBits` and scan the source bitmap directly without copying countless tiny chunks to new bitmaps.
Just realizing that there are two projects, my bad.
The obvious issue with the lock-on detection is that it can't differentiate the actual lock-on visual from any big white area. I have little to no experience with computer vision, but I imagine a decent approach would be: - Threshold the entire image to the required brightness level, so that anything less bright is just black - Find circles in the image - If there is a single circle of the correct size, it's very likely a lock-on Obviously this is a lot more complicated than the current approach. I know the EmguCV computer vision library comes with many built in algorithms including things like shape detection and may make this much easier. Haven't used it myself, though.
That is more or less what `Bitmap.LockBits` does. It gives you a pointer to the raw bitmap bytes that you can process manually (either via `unsafe` code or after marshalling it to a byte array). This is of course less convenient than `GetPixel` because it doesn't give you a `Color` object and you need to calculate the pixel offsets manually, but it's also *much* faster.
Another thing i could think of is getting the screenshot in a worse quality or converting it. So you have fewer pixels to check, the question is if the conversion time is shorter than the checking. Additional you could try if you can save performance by analysing a black and white image instead of a colored one. 
I saw your imgcut function, have you considered moving the img create graphics outside of it and pass the graphics as a parameter? so you would only do it once Edit: i was misreading, forget that
Ah the age old learners bane, variable scope. This old article is one of the better resources I have book marked for scope. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms973875.aspx 
Oh i have done something similar, maybe you find some inspiration. But i lost motivation along the way, so you have a moveable snake which eats food and gets longer. All you need is an empty Form1, .NET 4.0 and this code: Option Strict On Public Class Form1 Const Map_Width_Tiles As Integer = 15 Const Map_Height_Tiles As Integer = 15 Const Tile_Width As Integer = 30 Const Tile_Height As Integer = 30 Const ShowGrid As Boolean = False Friend WithEvents GaneTimer As New Timer With {.Interval = 200} Public Shared Random As New Random(Guid.NewGuid.GetHashCode) Public SnakeHead_Start As New Point(5, 5) Public Shared TilePen As New Pen(Brushes.Black, 1) Public Shared SnakeBrush As Brush = Brushes.Green Public Shared FoodBrush As Brush = Brushes.Blue Public Class Tile Public Coordinates As Point Public ReadOnly Property Location_inMap_Pixel As Point Get Return New Point(Coordinates.X * Tile_Width, Coordinates.Y * Tile_Height) End Get End Property Public Sub New(pCoordinates As Point) Coordinates = pCoordinates End Sub Public Sub Draw(ByRef g As Graphics, ByRef Snake As Snake, ByRef Food As List(Of Point)) If Snake.isOnTile(Me) Then g.FillRectangle(SnakeBrush, New Rectangle(Location_inMap_Pixel, New Size(Tile_Width, Tile_Height))) ElseIf Food.Contains(Coordinates) Then g.FillRectangle(FoodBrush, New Rectangle(Location_inMap_Pixel, New Size(Tile_Width, Tile_Height))) Else If ShowGrid Then g.DrawRectangle(TilePen, New Rectangle(Location_inMap_Pixel, New Size(Tile_Width, Tile_Height))) End If End Sub End Class Public Class Snake Public Enum Directions Stopped North East South West End Enum Public Head As Point Public Body As List(Of Point) Public CurrentDirection As Directions = Directions.East Public ReadOnly Property Direction_Diff As Point Get Select Case CurrentDirection Case Directions.North Return New Point(0, -1) Case Directions.South Return New Point(0, 1) Case Directions.East Return New Point(1, 0) Case Directions.West Return New Point(-1, 0) Case Else Return New Point(0, 0) End Select End Get End Property Public Sub New(pHead As Point) Head = pHead Body = New List(Of Point) End Sub Public Function isOnTile(ByRef TileToCheck As Tile) As Boolean Return HeadOnTile(TileToCheck) Or BodyOnTile(TileToCheck) End Function Private Function HeadOnTile(ByRef TileToCheck As Tile) As Boolean Return Head.Equals(TileToCheck.Coordinates) End Function Private Function BodyOnTile(ByRef TileToCheck As Tile) As Boolean Return Body.Contains(TileToCheck.Coordinates) End Function Public Sub ChangeDirection(Key As System.Windows.Forms.Keys) Select Case Key Case Keys.Up CurrentDirection = Directions.North Case Keys.Down CurrentDirection = Directions.South Case Keys.Left CurrentDirection = Directions.West Case Keys.Right CurrentDirection = Directions.East End Select End Sub Public Function foundFood(ByRef AvailableFood As List(Of Point)) As Boolean Return AvailableFood.Contains(Head) End Function Public Sub eatFood(ByRef AvailableFood As List(Of Point)) Body.Add(Head) AvailableFood.Remove(Head) End Sub Public Sub Move() Dim newBody As New List(Of Point) Dim PrevPoint As Point = Head For Each CurrentBodyPoint In Body Dim Point_Copy As Point = CurrentBodyPoint CurrentBodyPoint = PrevPoint newBody.Add(CurrentBodyPoint) PrevPoint = Point_Copy Next Body = newBody Head.Offset(Direction_Diff) End Sub End Class Private myMap As Dictionary(Of Point, Tile) Private myAvailableFood As List(Of Point) Private mySnake As Snake Private Sub Form1_KeyUp(sender As Object, e As System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs) Handles Me.KeyUp mySnake.ChangeDirection(e.KeyCode) MoveBoardState() End Sub Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load InitSnake() InitMap() InitFood() GaneTimer.Start() End Sub Private Sub InitFood() myAvailableFood = New List(Of Point) CreateRandomFood() End Sub Private Sub CreateRandomFood() Dim coord As New Point(Random.Next(1, Map_Width_Tiles + 1), Random.Next(1, Map_Height_Tiles + 1)) myAvailableFood.Add(coord) End Sub Private Sub InitSnake() mySnake = New Snake(SnakeHead_Start) End Sub Private Sub InitMap() myMap = New Dictionary(Of Point, Tile) For h = 1 To Map_Height_Tiles For w = 1 To Map_Width_Tiles Dim coord As New Point(w, h) Dim t As New Tile(coord) myMap.Add(t.Coordinates, t) Next Next End Sub Private Sub Form1_Paint(sender As Object, e As System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs) Handles Me.Paint Dim g As Graphics = Me.CreateGraphics For Each Tile In myMap.Values Tile.Draw(g, mySnake, myAvailableFood) Next If Not ShowGrid Then 'Draw Map Borders if we show no grid g.DrawRectangle(TilePen, Map_Width_Tiles, Map_Height_Tiles, Map_Width_Tiles * Tile_Width, Map_Height_Tiles * Tile_Height) End If End Sub Private Sub GaneTimer_Tick(sender As Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles GaneTimer.Tick MoveBoardState() End Sub Private Sub MoveBoardState() mySnake.Move() If mySnake.foundFood(myAvailableFood) Then mySnake.eatFood(myAvailableFood) CreateRandomFood() End If Me.Refresh() End Sub End Class 
The relvant Part for you is this: Public Sub Move() Dim newBody As New List(Of Point) Dim PrevPoint As Point = Head For Each CurrentBodyPoint In Body Dim Point_Copy As Point = CurrentBodyPoint CurrentBodyPoint = PrevPoint newBody.Add(CurrentBodyPoint) PrevPoint = Point_Copy Next Body = newBody Head.Offset(Direction_Diff) End Sub Basically i take the list of bodypoints and overwrite the first point with the head, the second with the first, the third with the second and so on. And then i move the head of the snake in the choosen direction 
How would I assign the two variables in the same sub?
You're going to have to include the code for us to review.
thanks!!!
http://imgur.com/a/VLj34 The first image is just a title screen that opens other forms. When I close out of it the music stops. However, when I try to exit out of the second form seen in the second picture, the music keeps going
Thank you for the tips, now I just need one last thing. I tried google earlier and found nothing. How do I make this activate when somebody hits the "x" button?
When the user presses the "X" the Form's "Closing" event is called. See here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.form.closing(v=vs.110).aspx I started with VB back in early 93, but have moved to C# primarily because it is in more use now than VB. Just be aware of that.
Thanks 
When do you expect the answer text to show up? Because right now the only time it is going to trigger is when someone types in it. 
I want the answer to display as soon as the user views the form, to do that would I put on the button in form 3 that takes the user to form 4? When I do that how do I get the answer to display in the answer text box? In form 3 after the equation would I put public answer as integer and in form 4 put Private Sub changeAnswer(ByRef Answer As Integer) Form3.Answer = Answer End Sub and before the text box put Dim Answer as integer
Alright, now that I'm no longer on mobile I can give a more complete answer. So, I'm going to be honest. This whole thing is a bit of a mess. I don't have that much time this morning, so I'm going to assume that everything in Form3 is working correctly. The only thing I would recommend changing is how you call Form4. We want to change that to: Private Sub Calc_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Calc.Click dim frmAnswer As New Form4 frmAnswer.showDialog() '.showDialog() displays the form as a modal. This helps if you don't want the user to change form3 while form4 is showing. If you do not want this behavior, change it back to .show() End Sub You should do the same for any place that you're calling a new form. The reason we want to do this is so that the form has a reset state each time you call it. Otherwise, you're going to run into problems trying to track and manage the state of any particular form. Don't worry about .Hide(). It will hide itself when the user closes the form. The (main) problem in form4 is that the only place you set the answer.text is in its own textchanged handler. Public Sub Answer_TextChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Answer.TextChanged If (Form2.A = 1) And (Form2.U = 1) And (Form2.T = 1) Then Answer.Text = Form3.Uv + Form3.Av * Form3.Tv End If End Sub This means a) it won't run that code until something else changes the text in that textbox, and b) it will cause the program to go into a infinite loop, as Answer.TextChanged will trigger itself when it changes the text. To get the code to run when form4 opens, put it in the form4.load event handler: Private Sub Form4_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Form4.Load If (Form2.A = 1) And (Form2.U = 1) And (Form2.T = 1) Then Answer.Text = Form3.Uv + Form3.Av * Form3.Tv End If End Sub So, now for the overall application. I don't know what you're trying to accomplish here, but there are a few points that will cause you some pain later on: 1) From what I can see, you're burying the user in forms. Consider re-designing it so that there are never more than two forms shown at once. This is more of a UX consideration than a coding one. 2) You're passing information from one form to the next to the next to the next. Consider creating a class for an object that will encapsulate all of the information needed by all forms, then just refer to that object. 3) You're manually handling all of your textbox's .text property. Once you've addressed point #2, you'll have an object that you can databind to. Databinding these properties will clean a lot of your code up, as any control databound to your object will update when the object changes. \#3 probably sounds a bit confusing to you at the moment. One of these days I'll write a tutorial on creating data objects and binding to them. This sub sorely needs it. That's all I have time for right now. If you have any questions, feel free to ask and I'll get to them as I can.
Wow this is really detailed, thanks for doing this. I'm only a year 11 IPT Student and to learn Visual Basic we were given that maths game tutorial thing and then told to go make whatever we wanted for our major project this semester, so I don't really know that much. I decided to make a calculator that uses equations of motion (as I am also a physics student) and automatically chooses the appropriate equation depending on what variables the user has (that's what's going on in form 3) I figured it would just be a bunch of if statements and a few equations (ha ha ha, boy was I wrong). I've just got into bed though and I'm on my phone so I'll try this in the morning and let you know how I go. Thanks again for doing this. 
Is this public facing or intranet? There are lots of utilities out there on the web to do this for web facing sites, like this one from the w3c https://validator.w3.org/checklink If it is intranet only, I am sure there are utilities for that as well. No harm in writing your own, but also no need to reinvent the wheel.
is it fixed? Did you update the image?
no. abc should be 3 digit number between 100 and 999. and abc = a³ + b³ + c³ ( for example : 153 = 1³ + 5³ + 3³ ) Program should find and output these numbers.
ok well then you need to do something like this dim a,b,c,abc as integer for a = 1 to 9 for b = 0 to 9 for c = 0 to 9 abc = a*100 + b*10 +c if abc = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 then msgbox (abc) end if next c next b next a This code may not be exactly right in syntax but it gives the general impression of how to do it. 
Thanks very much ! 
I am sure others are wondering the same so here are all the numbers for which this true: * 153 * 370 * 371 * 407
Dear god.
I'm thinking you must be missing those files?
I'm using Visual Basic, btw, u want me to literally rename the project? I clicked the name of it once, changed it and when I loaded it up all the forms were gone. They were on the side bar and I clicked them to load them back. Guess that's supposed to happen.
Love to, but the computer isn't mine. School project dude. 
If your format is always like this then you could split the resulting readline based on the comma into an array. This would give you &lt;UserID=frankcastle in the 0 index of the array and Char=Punisher&gt; in the 1 index of the array. Then to get the information from those two elements, you would split again based off the = delimiter and trim off the remaining &gt; Here's an example using a static string Dim str As String = "&lt;UserID=frankcastle, Char=Punisher&gt;" 'Take the str value and split it against the comma and store 'it into an array called elements Dim elements() As String = str.Split(","c) 'now split element 0 on its = sign and take element 1 of the result MsgBox(elements(0).Split("="c)(1)) 'now split element 1 on its = sign and take element 1 of the result and trim off the trailing "&gt;" character MsgBox(elements(1).Split("="c)(1).TrimEnd("&gt;"c)) As long as this format is maintained for each line, this code should display the two items after the = sign on each row. Instead of messageboxes, you could easily just store these values to descriptive variables so that you know what you're accessing when needed. 
Yeah, that works for me. The closing forma in normal. Whenever you hit the x next to the froms name it wile close. After renaming and saving, does it work now?
Think he is using vs 2010. Should work fine on 7
Not to screw things up, but depending on your needs you might want to consider using XML
Forgot quotation marks😭😭😭😭😭
Assuming that txtDistance and txtTime are textboxes you have to access the content by using txtDistance.Text and txtTime.Text. Btw this will throw an exception if you don't enter a number. Also you are declaring an output which is never used and you have a Convert.ToString(time) doing absolutely nothing.
What error are you actually getting
[removed]
Literally the first link when googling "visual basic How do I change the load order of the forms" Do you even search machine?
set the ControlBox property to false. You can also remove any entry in the .Text property and you will no longer have a titlebar for the window. Then just set the windowstate property to maximized. I'm pretty sure that without a title, the taskbar is ignored so it will be covered. Play with those 2 properties to reach your desired effect. You didn't really specify what your issue was with the windows taskbar but text and no text will affect how the form is shown maximized.
Thank you so much. I got it working and I am very happy. 
Thank you that helps a lot. 
Alright so then As Double should fix that correct? 
yes, use double for things you expect a decimal 
That's awesome! Glad you're excited about programming :)
Yes, I figured it out though. But thanks 
That I know of, there's nothing that you can do in PowerShell that you can't do in VB.NET, and there's way more that you can do in .NET than you can do with PowerShell. Unless you really want to use PowerShell, I'd just write a VB app if you want UI. 
Well you can host PowerShell in a .NET app, so if you already have PS Scripts that would probably work. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee706563%28v=vs.85%29.aspx While this is in C#, the concepts are identical. https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/kebab/2014/04/28/executing-powershell-scripts-from-c/

Well, technically you can open the same file multiple times by specifying the desired [FileShare](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.fileshare.aspx) value when opening it, but *writing* from multiple processes at once without corrupting data is rather challenging. The easy option is to keep the file open for as short as possible, and keep retrying to open it when another process is currently using it. This'll be simple if you are only appending new lines to the file, but if you are actively editing existing data you'll need some sort of algorithm to decide how to merge multiple changes etc. If you have a more complicated scenario, you should consider abandoning the text-file only approach in favor of using an actual database that can safely handle concurrent users.
If you're going to use a database, use Microsoft SQl Server. It's free(up to 12GB), easy and built-in to windows and visual studio. This is super good advice for the rest of your life. Use Oracle if you want to regret being born and MySQL if you want to regret waking up that day.
Well, you're probably going to have a better chance than we are. Seeing that you did nothing but give us a screen shot of an error. If you would like some help trying to resolve this issue, go ahead and post the code involved in working up to this problem so that we have something to work with. 
You might find better help from the r/cplusplus subreddit. This is r/visualbasic. 
Thanks mate this worked perfectly! You're a star!
To fix this start a new project, and on the accordian menu on the left look for the "Open Visual Studio Installer" link. On the workloads tabs on the right hand side you will find a ".NET desktop development" link. Click on it to install all the desktop templates.
Disclaimer: "I think" When you create a project, you can choose not to create a solution file - you'll only have the .proj file. When you File, Add Project, a solution is created because you have two projects.
&gt;A few more details, what I basically want it to do is save an "image" as .pdf, .jpg, or whatever to a file either on my computer or our google drive and have it set the name based on the name field and date field on the form. While technically possible, I'd wonder why you don't save the input to something like SQL, then regenerate the output on demand using that data. This would be a typical solution and would take up orders of magnitude less storage space / bandwidth. &gt;is that something I can do with VB Yes, though I don't have a lot of info on current best practices in web. I'd imagine this would be done using ASP.net/VB.net? &gt;second, some advice on where to start Hopefully someone with more web experience steps in, but I'd start by looking at ASP.net/VB.net tutorials. Or just jump right in. Visual studio has a template for ASP.net Web Page using VB.net as backend. 
thanks for the info, the reason I want to save them as files is this is just going to be replacing hardcopies of daily reporting. It will mostly be used by my operations manager and his computer literacy extends pretty much to click on file to open it, so I thought it would be easier on him to just have a pdf of each report with the engineers name and date of report on it. 
Update, in case your still interested. I realized, after some trial and error, that s Google sheet, provide everything I need for this project. No VB needed. Se la vie
Thank you. I will give this a shot later.

Should be able to merge them in to a single date time by using the string representations. Dim x As DateTime = Convert.ToDateTime(DateTimePicker1.Value.Date.ToString("MM/dd/yyy") &amp; " " &amp; ComboBox1.SelectedValue)
the first is for backwards compat to make it easier to port vb6/vba code. the 2nd is when you have something that doesn't have a ToString. (does that even ever happen? maybe when using literals?) the 3rd is the "standard" for most things.
Literals get a ToString method as well.
Yes it can be done with VB. You can do a web server using anything from HttpListener (very basic, but excellent to learn how a web server works), NancyFX, ASP.Net (the "big guns" option) and probably half a dozen others. I like NancyFX for it's simplicity. For similar projects (small, internal websites) I generally use TopShelf (to be able to run the app as a service) and NancyFX. For my NancyFX / TopShelf starting template, I converted [this example](http://blog.amosti.net/self-hosted-http-service-in-c-with-nancy-and-topshelf/) to VB. Like others have said, using a database would probably be best (you can then use the data to produce images and/or PDFs), but if you prefer going directly to the img/pdf, I'd choose PDF (that way you can more easily re-read the data eventually if needed). iTextSharp is pretty much the go-to tool for producing PDFs with .Net. Here's a short example I keep in LinqPad for iTextSharp: (you can download iTextSharp with NuGet) Sub Main Dim dpi = 72f Dim doc = New Document(New rectangle(8.5f * dpi, 11f * dpi)) Dim writer = PdfWriter.GetInstance(doc, New FileStream("G:\test1.pdf", FileMode.Create)) Dim Arial = BaseFont.CreateFont(BaseFont.HELVETICA, BaseFont.CP1252, BaseFont.EMBEDDED) doc.Open Dim cb = writer.DirectContent cb.BeginText cb.SetFontAndSize(Arial, 10) cb.ShowTextAligned(PdfContentByte.ALIGN_CENTER, "Hello there!", 200, 500, 0) ' 0,0 is bottom left cb.EndText writer.Flush doc.Close doc.Dispose Process.Start("G:\test1.pdf") End Sub 
No. You can google this. Throw away account, you knew this is what you were going to get troll. 
There are lots of ways of identifying the last day of the month that take leap years into account. My favourite one is to subtract 1 day from the next month. That puts all the responsibility into the date libraries, which presumably have been well-tested. For example, if you want to find the last day of February in the current year, just subtract 1 day from March 1. That will give you Feb 28 in non-leap-years and Feb 29 in leap years. You can then use that "last day of month" date to determine whether your test date is past the end of the month or not.
I didn't understand what the link means? So could you please elaborate further? Thanks by the way
&gt;Integral types represent only whole numbers (positive, negative, and zero), and nonintegral types represent numbers with both integer and fractional parts. 
Ok I got it. I was supposed to Dim Grade1 and Grade2 As Decimal. Thanks for the help :)
Just to give a short example on splitting up your duplicate code using Select/Case and Functions Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Dim Credits1, Credits2 As Integer Dim Grade1, Grade2 As Decimal Dim GPA As Single Grade1 = -1 Grade2 = -1 Grade1 = LetterToGpa(TextGrade1.Text) Grade2 = LetterToGpa(TextGrade2.Text) If Grade1 = -1 OrElse Grade2 = -1 Then MessageBox.Show("You Need to enter a Valid Grade") Return End If Credits1 = TextCredits1.Text Credits2 = TextCredits2.Text GPA = (((Grade1 * Credits1) + (Grade2 * Credits2)) / (Credits1 + Credits2)) MessageBox.Show(GPA) End Sub Public Function LetterToGpa(LetterGrade As String) As Decimal Select Case LetterGrade Case "A" : Return 4.0 Case "A-" : Return 3.67 Case "B+" : Return 3.33 Case "B" : Return 3 Case "B-" : Return 2.67 Case "C+" : Return 2.33 Case "C" : Return 2 Case "C-" : Return 1.67 Case "D+" : Return 1.33 Case "D" : Return 1 Case "F" : Return 0 Case Else : Return -1 End Select End Function
&gt; Explaining it to the teacher is probably equivalent to actually doing the homework... This is an amazing answer.
 Public Declare Auto Function SetCursorPos Lib "User32.dll" (ByVal X As Integer, ByVal Y As Integer) As Long Dim X As New Random Dim Y As New Random I think this is what you're looking for? Apologies if it's not.
Without the full code, I don't have the ability to test... but try this for me and let me know what you get Remove your Y random object Change &gt;SetCursorPos((X.Next(1350, 1400)), Y.Next(400, 448)) To &gt;SetCursorPos((X.Next(1350, 1400)), X.Next(400, 448)) As random is seeded by the system time, and you're generating them basically at the same time, they get stuck with the same seed. Using the same object and iterating twice should provide two distinct values.
This worked! Fantastic! http://imgur.com/a/jHKGZ The green dots are the clicks that occurred after making your suggested change, which is exactly what I was looking for. So just so I understand, why is it that I needed to replace my Y-coordinate with a secondary X-coordinate? I wouldn't have thought to do this on my own. The way I understood it was I defined the box with minimum and maximum values (x,y) like plotting a point on a graph...is it wrong to think of it this way in this instance? I was so confused as to why it would plot in a linear fashion, even though every tick, the (x,y) should have randomized. With the way I had it, how come it was impossible for let's say...(1355, 425) to happen, which would have plotted a point in the lower left section of the square, even though it was in the set of minimum/maximum values? Is this simply due to the seed explanation given in your first comment?
I appreciate your help and explanations :) Thank you so much.
wow! instant reply. thank you I dont really know the difference but I will try it 
Sounds like you have to enter your credentials first. I found this through Google. Dim smtpClient As New System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient("mail.yourdomain.com.au") smtpClient.Credentials = New System.Net.NetworkCredential("username", "password") 
It depends on what you are planning to do. Upper left (UWP) is for Windows Applications, like e.g the calculator. The upper right (WPF) is for standard desktop applications. I'm, for example, using uwp and wpf.
2010 is .net, but if you're install 2017 the example likely to need some code changes to function. you might be able to find Visual Basic 2010 Express on cnet or softpedia or something, it's not available direct from MS anymore. 
I use the "TweetMoaSharp" library, available on Nuget. My tweet sending code looks like this: Dim twitter = New TwitterService("&lt;consumerKey&gt;", "&lt;consumerSecret&gt;", "&lt;token&gt;", "&lt;tokenSecret&gt;") Dim sto = New SendTweetOptions Dim msg = "Your tweet here" sto.Status = Left(msg, 140).Trim ' max tweet length; tweets fail if too long... Dim twitterStatus = twitter.SendTweet(sto) If twitterStatus IsNot Nothing Then ' tweet sent Else ' tweet failed End If
You defined Grade1 as integer this only allows whole numbers... Make it a decimal and it will work.
It's worth trying 2017. Most code needs no changes when migrating from 2010 to 2017. The only time there are really any changes are in odd project types like installers, SSIS, SQL server, etc. these aren't VB though. Source: I'm a professional developer and I migrate legacy code from 2005 - 2010 to 2017 all the time. 
Basically this is why my home automation system is in VB. I learned VB when I was much younger, and whenever I am trying to code in any language, I am generally thinking in terms of VB and then figuring out how to translate to the language I am working in. So it just made sense to do VB where nobody else cared. And it works great.
It's up to the SMTP mail server admin. If the server is configured to only allow authenticated users then you must supply creds. This was a huge problem a couple of decades ago when a lot of unsecured SMTP servers on the internet were sending massive amounts of spam mail, everyone and anyone can use it. 
Visual studio community edition is great 
When run from the bat file, your vbs sends a command line to cmd.exe which looks like **WinAIA64.exe -set "USERASSETDATA.ASSET_NUMBER=&lt;whatever was entered&gt;**, cmd.exe just executes it. what you need to do is replace Wscript.echo "WinAIA64.exe -set " &amp; Chr(34) &amp; "USERASSETDATA.ASSET_NUMBER=" &amp; strMessage &amp; Chr(34) with CreateObject( "WScript.Shell" ).Run "cmd /c WinAIA64.exe -set " &amp; Chr(34) &amp; "USERASSETDATA.ASSET_NUMBER=" &amp; strMessage &amp; Chr(34) 
Thanks for pointing me in the right direction, now that I have it working I'm embarrassed I even asked. Here's what I have now and it runs just fine If Not WScript.Arguments.Named.Exists("elevate") Then CreateObject("Shell.Application").ShellExecute WScript.FullName _ , """" &amp; WScript.ScriptFullName &amp; """ /elevate", "", "runas", 1 WScript.Quit End If strInput = InputBox("Enter Asset Tag") Dim oShell Set oShell = WScript.CreateObject ("WScript.Shell") oShell.Run "cmd /K C:\DRIVERS\WINAIA\" &amp; "WinAIA64.exe -set USERASSETDATA.ASSET_NUMBER=" &amp; strInput Set oShell = Nothing Just needs a few minor tweaks like keeping the command window hidden and I'll re-add the vbYesNo. Thanks again for your input. Maybe this will help someone in the future considering how easily this script could be modified and applied to run just about anything. 
 _+_ is for addition. _&amp;_ is for string concatenation. _+_ will sometimes work for string concatenation (and other times it will perform math), but this is a perfect example of why to not use + when building strings. You should also work with the values of the controls, not call the controls directly, so cnip.text, and dtpicker.date (I think it was date, but it's been too many years since I used VB6).
Yeah, I tried "&amp;" and it works

I created a grid of 100 buttons, assigning each a sub in the code, each of those bad to contain 2-3 if statements in my current solution I have dimmed 6 variables, 2 of which are string, 4 are integers I have a while loop saying while the number chosen is more than 0, the game's Boolean value is true, but when it is zero and game is false, display game over The winner is decided by 3 dual layer IF statements respective to each player The variables are as follows 3 integers for the scores 1 integer for the number of numbers chosen 1 string for the winner's letter 1 string I cannot remember The code is at school, it is a project we have to do so I will put down as much as I can My teacher claimed it can be done in under 20 lines of code, so I was very confused at that That is as much as I can remember
The best way to do this is to break it down into smaller parts and then work on each part. I'd consider making a custom class with button as parent and add taken_by to the class and add an event when taken_by changes update the text of that button and modify the scores. Make an array of those buttons on the screen and the scores and remaining unclaimed squares.
Im not sure how to do that, I think it was one of the lessons I missed, would you be able to give code examples and break it down to more detail Thankyou 
Here is an article from MSDN on how to customize controls: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms996443.aspx I cannot provide code examples or break it down any further.
Smart. I am new to VB and I was asking myself, doesn't echo just display like a messageBox? But I did not think immediately to your solution and it's a great insightful tool
Ok, I think I figured it out. I didn't need the intArraySize variable at all. Instead, I initialize the MovieRatings integer array with a -1, to get rid of the default 0 that is associated with, and it works. My final code that appears to be functioning as intended is below, I'm leaving this here in case someone else runs into a similar issue or in case anyone else has feedback: 'Create two arrays, one To store movie names And one To store associated ratings, display To listbox. Allow user To input multiple times And To clear data. Find an average Of the user's ratings. Public Class Form1 'create arrays as global variables so user may input multiple times Dim MovieTitles(0) As String Dim MovieRatings(-1) As Integer 'Track last array position Dim intLastArrayPosition As Integer = 0 Private Sub btnMovieRating_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnMovieRating.Click Dim C As Integer 'Counter Dim intMovieEntries As Integer = CInt(InputBox("How many movie ratings would you like to add?"))

You need to use mousedown and mouseup events instead.
Care to elaborate further on your question? My *GUESS* is that the form size is being defined somewhere in your code. 
It is worth checking what the type of form it is, some form types do allow to be resized https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1119256/how-do-i-prevent-a-form-from-being-resized-by-the-user
Without being harsh, if you can't explain the question, we can't really help you. Maybe if you drew out some diagrams of what you wanted and posted them to imgur?
i meaned that lets say that this point get to this location http://imgur.com/r40sVMX it will teleport to here like not teleport like you know comes from the other side of the form from here http://imgur.com/Py7HKk9
I fixed it now thanks 
object.location is probably what you want. If you want it to move in steps, then you'll need a timer and add to the location.x and location.y each time the timer ticks. 
no i dont want like that it wil move in steps i want that when its passing the window from right it will come from left like old games do you understand what i mean? 
Yep. You just need to set the .location.x and location.y You can use form.width to get the right edge, something like this: object.location = new point(me.width -object.width, object.location.y) 
You're welcome. It helped me (years ago) to start think in terms of contrary. Meaning; What is the opposite of what the issue is. In this case; You can't resize. So asking "how to resize a form" may have gotten you there. Best of luck
im new in coding so where i need to write it in the timer?
http://imgur.com/QIcyeKn i wrote it like that is it okey how i wrote it cus its dosent work
You'll want to check snake.location, not snake.height. So when the location gets to 0 (moving up or left), location gets to the panel.width (moving right), or location gets to panel.height (moving down), then you have hit the edge. You'll have to add some additional code to handle the width of snake at the bottom or right edges, since .location is the top, left point of the object. 
ty
Try Environment.Exit(-1) 
You need a form / module level variable to let the FormClosing event know that you really want to close the form. Private closingFromNotify as boolean Private Sub frmNota_FormClosing(sender As Object, e As FormClosingEventArgs) Handles Me.FormClosing if closingFromNotify = false then Me.Visible = False e.Cancel = True end if End Sub Private Sub QuitNotapyToolStripMenuItem_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles QuitNotapyToolStripMenuItem.Click closingFromNotify = true me.close End Sub
Can someone please send a valid code that does not expire 
Worked flawlessly! Thank you! :)
Here's what I did: I placed a Timer object with a 1000 (ms) value as Interval on the form and for each tick, update the Label object. Private Sub tmrNIS_Tick(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles tmrNIS.Tick statClock.Text = Format(Date.Now, "hh:mm:ss tt") End Sub
errr, can you explain what that code does? and why do i need to put it in my code?
Oh shoot, sorry, I thought this was for VB.net.
Form load happens once when the form is loaded. Form Activate happens anytime the form is brought into focus (so when another program is switched to the front, and then your program is brought back to the front). Neither of these is useful, since Time() returns the current time right now. 
That's .NET, but the concept is similar. If you want the time to be updated constantly, you'll have to write code to update it (calling Time once won't do anything for you). The timer in the sample above "ticks" once every second, and each time that it does it updates the control that contains the time. 
Drop a timer on the form with a 1000ms interval, set the value of the control you want on the timer tick event. ControlName.Text = Now.ToLongTimeString
My first suggestion would be to step through it in the debugger and find out where it's spending all that time.
You might get better help in r/VBA 
Okay thanks!
So, the problem is with your regex. I'm not sure what you were trying to do with that, but it was matching the whole string, which is why you had to .split the value out of ipReresultsList. matches only had one value in it (the whole string). There are a couple of different regexs you can use here, depending on how specific you want to get. If you don't care if it's a valid IP address (it will match 999.999.999.999) and want to grab anything that looks like an IP address, then the following is fine: \b\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\b If you want to restrict it to only valid IP addresses, then use the following: \b(?:(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.){3}(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\b The above one will allow for leading zeroes (eg. 122.012.001.123). If you don't want to allow leading zeroes, you can use the following: \b(?:(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|1[0-9][0-9]|[1-9]?[0-9])\.){3}(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|1[0-9][0-9]|[1-9]?[0-9])\b See [here](http://www.regular-expressions.info/ip.html) for more info. Once that is done, you can simplify your for...each code to the following: For Each ipReresultsList As Match In matches ListBox1.Items.Add(ipReresultsList) Next
How are you wanting the players to discover each other? * Are you wanting them to type in each other's IP address so they can connect? * Are you wanting them to be able to see each other in a game list via a server?
Best would probably be seeing each other via a central server 
Have you looked into a TCP client-server connection?
A bit yeah this seems like the best way to go about it, and advice or online resources you know of that could help me implement this into the game code I have now?
[This page](http://vb.net-informations.com/communications/vb.net_multithreaded_server_socket_programming.htm) was where I started getting into networking, and has a decent multi-client handling server example. I do recommend becoming more familiar with how multithreaded applications operate before tackling this example as it does require some additional background information.
Okay thanks that looks good, cheers for the help
rsabsen.Close ttunjangan = rsabsen(0).Value you are trying to access an object that is closed.
rsabsen looks like a recordset, and you close it a few lines up from where your error occurs. You can't access rsabsen(0).value when you have already called rsabsen.close. So that is at least part of your problem. The other problem is why oh why are you using VB6? It is nearly ancient by now.
Nah, thats not the problem. I solve it by myself. if you see my code, i opened the recordset again. I gave it an "if clause". 
Nah, i opened it again. Problem solved by myself, i gave it if clause Idk man, Its my college's decision to teach us this shit. I guess i'll find a hard time trying to find someone who hire a vb6 programmer
Look into a mail merge
Is the timer enabled? Check it's properties. You may also need to add Timer1.Enabled = True before calling it to start. 
Might be a silly question but is your button working? Do the events in code behind still have their handlers? "Handles Button1.Click", etc?
Oh ya cause it fires other functions just fine. 
Mind sharing the relevant code for your button and timer?
I guess you know this and wait more than 3 seconds before shutting down the application, but the timer doesn't fire immediately, there is a delay before the first tick as well (a delay you specified at the Interval)
You could potentially use embedded `Select Case` statements.
what code are you using to open the file? process.start, shell etc.?
Your words are meaningless. We need code.

Hi all, I found out finally my computer was denied access to send email. My code worked the whole time... 
Environment.GetCommandLineArgs()
do I have to run it from the command line for that to work?
If you need to pass in arguments (command line options) you can pass them in from a command prompt, from the run command, or by making a shortcut icon to your exe and adding arguments to the shortcut in the properties for it. If you need it to run in the background every few days, you could also create a scheduled task and add arguments there
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.backgroundworker(v=vs.110).aspx You should try background-worker, It's make your process working in the shadow without making your GUI look "Unresponsive"..
Thanks for the reply! However, I'm not quite sure how to set the backgroundWorker to work with the process... 1. I have Process.Filename = [youtubedl executable] 2. I set backgroundRun as new backgroundWorker. What should I do next?
lol the well supported ssh libraries for vb6 cost more than that. 
That worked, thanks!
I had a program that did that. It was a simple IDE for supercomputers. It had a basic text editor, but the compile and run buttons would be executed on the server. Unfortunately I lost the hard drive it was on two decades ago.
`xlValues` is a default value as part of Excel. It's actual value is `-4163`. You could just create a constant value and use that as a placeholder.
[You're probably looking for this.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2216141/get-programs-path)
This seems like it. But, i've never built folders into my build either. Honestly, i've never really packaged something as an installable; I just run it from VB most of the time. I think I might need the ground up version of "How do I get this ready for installation on another PC' tutorial. So I have on my desktop a folder; lets call it DataFolder. In my program I reference "C:\User\Desktop\DataFolder\Filetobecalled.txt Now I want that file to ship with the program to. And ill need the folder. Then Ill need the way to turn "C:\User\Desktop" into the path the installation gets sent to. Sorry if this seems really basic. Ive never done this part before
Depending on the size of your whole program, you probably don't even need to package it as an installer. You can zip it up as a portable program and just have it reference the executable's location as the base folder. As long as everyone else has the .NET Framework installed (Which just about every Windows installation already has them installed) then the program should run properly.
ohhhh this seems simple. So I dont have the builder build it. I build it in a zip. So that it extracts. Put in a line to find out the exe files location (which would be the link you gave) and use that as the reference point, since all the other folders would be zipped down the way I need it. Its just text files for data; that seems doable
I would do something like If annual &gt; 19500 and annual &lt; 21499 then Label.text = 19500 Else if annual &gt; 21499 and annual &lt; 23999 then Label.text = 21500 Else if annual &gt; 24000 then Label.text = 24000 End if In vb I don't believe you can just line assignment statements like you have. Maybe you were thinking about tertiary statements?
Windows has built in reference points too, such as 'appdata'. I'd suggest using that, make a folder in appdata and store anything in there. Use the line: Dim appdata as string = environment.getenvironmentvariable("appdata") To get the appdata path for that computer, then create a folder in that path Environment.currentdirectory = appdata io.directory.createdirectory("myFolder") environment.currentdirectory = "myFolder" And now you're in a folder called myFolder where you can put your save info, and this will work on any computer, no hardcoding needed. To view the appdata folder manually, enter WIN + R then enter %appdata% in the run dialogue
This looks easy enough. Let me see if I grasp how its working. Since I hate using things I dont understand the logic of: enviroment.currentdirectory = appdata this sets the string appdata to the current directory that the executable is located in. So it would return something like C:\Desktop\MyApp io.directory.createdirectory("myFolder") This creates a folder called myFolder; but how does it know where to make it? With no set path does it just make it in the appdata current directory? enviroment.currentdirectory = myfolder this would seem to be the same as the first, but then there is no variable myFolder I think something that's confusing me is that in your first example: Dim appdata as String = enviroment.getenviromentvariable ("appdata") it looks like you are creating a variable and using the variable to define it self. Like, Dim X as integer = X sort of deal. I must be reading it wrong
So you're close, and actually I had made a mistake in my original, that I've now edited (notice the added quotes around myFolder) Here's what each line does: Dim appdata as String = enviroment.getenviromentvariable ("appdata") This creates a string variable called appdata and sets it to the result of enviroment.getenviromentvariable ("appdata") This line passes the *string* "appdata" to the environment function *getenvironmentvariable*. We're not passing the variable appdata, just the word appdata. The function will then return the folder path for appdata for the computer that the program is running on. ... Environment.currentdirectory = appdata This sets the current folder to the string in the appdata variable. Think of this like setting the folder the application is thinking about, similar to the CD command in command prompt. io.directory.createdirectory("myFolder") This creates a folder called 'myFolder', it's not a variable but a string, I just forgot the quotes before my edit. You don't need to provide the whole path because we've already changed the working directory to appdata with the previous line. Hope that helps a bit 
I think it does. Lets see if I can work it out Dim appdata as string = enviroment.getenviromentvariable ("myApp") This gets the path to the folder that the program "myApp" is. So the working path is now something like "C:\Desktop\MyApp" Environment.currentdirectory = appdata This line tells the program that we should use this as the default path unless otherwise told so, the path being the one we just defined io.directory.createdirectory("myFolder") This then creates a folder, and since we did not specify where, it will defualt to the appdata path, which would be "C:\Desktop\MyApp\MyFolder" Then going the final step all I would need to do is when specifying a path say something like Dim sr as new stream reader (appdata &amp; "\myfolder\" &amp; FileName) And it would look for: "C:\Desktop\MyApp\MyFolder\Filename.txt" I wouldn't need to worry about where the program was because I can get it with the getEnviormentvariable; and once I know that I can make everything after. 
Hey, quick follow up question; running crange.EntireRow.Copy(GlobalVariables.oWb.Worksheets("sheet2").Range("A" &amp; GlobalVariables.oExcel.Rows.Count).End(GlobalVariables.oExcel.xlUp)) throws up a bad index error - I'm not really sure what's triggering this. Sorry for the necro of my previous post.
click "formatting help" for how to format code, or use a pastebin or gist. the lack of formatting make it hard to audit. I'm not quite sure `With MFICHK.Cells` does what want, but I don't don't do a lot of VBA. I'd expect that to be `With Destination.Cells`, in which case it wouldn't be inconsistent, it would just never work and show an error.
Can you post the entire code of the relevant method?
this issue might resolve around `Range("B1:B" &amp; lastrow, "A1:U21")` you're specifying 2 ranges using syntax that is designed for 2 cells, and specifically 2 cell objects, not string. A1 is a cell, A1:U21 is a range. I'm not really sure what you expect this to do.
 With GlobalVariables.oWb.Worksheets("Mastersheet") GlobalVariables.oWb.Worksheets("Mastersheet").select rng = GlobalVariables.oExcel.Range("D2:D750") crange = rng.Find(What:=txtSearch.Text, LookIn:=xlvaluable, LookAt:=counter) firstaddress = crange.Address rowcount = xlWs.UsedRange.Rows.Count If crange Is Nothing Then MsgBox("Search not found.", vbOKOnly) Exit Sub End If Do crange.EntireRow.Copy(GlobalVariables.oWb.Worksheets("sheet2").Range("A" &amp; rowcount).Offset(1)) lbxResults.MultiColumn = 24 lastrow = GlobalVariables.oWb.Worksheets("sheet2").Cells(GlobalVariables.oWb.Worksheets("Sheet2").Rows.Count, 1).Row lbxResults.Items.AddRange(GlobalVariables.oWb.Worksheets("sheet2").Range("B1:B" &amp; lastrow, "A1:U21").Value) crange = rng.FindNext(crange) Loop While crange.Address &lt;&gt; firstaddress
frankly, I don't get why it specifies 2 ranges either. This was coded by a previous employee - it runs in vba but I'm also thrown for a loop regarding the 2 ranges.
it's possible that VBA is ignoring the 2nd one and the .net layer is confused. 
I tried shortening it to just a single range and this is the full resulting error message An unhandled exception of type 'System.Reflection.AmbiguousMatchException' occurred in Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll Additional information: Overload resolution failed because no Public 'AddRange' can be called with these arguments: 'Public Sub AddRange(value As System.Windows.Forms.ListBox.ObjectCollection)': Argument matching parameter 'value' cannot convert from 'Object(,)' to 'ObjectCollection'. 'Public Sub AddRange(items As System.Object())': Argument matching parameter 'items' cannot convert from 'Object(,)' to 'Object()'. I assume that those subs are from .net
what's the exact code? `Object(,)` is weird. and maybe you don't need the .Value?
 With GlobalVariables.oWb.Worksheets("Mastersheet") GlobalVariables.oWb.Worksheets("Mastersheet").select rng = GlobalVariables.oExcel.Range("D2:D750") crange = rng.Find(What:=txtSearch.Text, LookIn:=xlvaluable, LookAt:=counter) firstaddress = crange.Address rowcount = xlWs.UsedRange.Rows.Count If crange Is Nothing Then MsgBox("Search not found.", vbOKOnly) Exit Sub End If Do crange.EntireRow.Copy(GlobalVariables.oWb.Worksheets("sheet2").Range("A" &amp; rowcount).Offset(1)) lbxResults.MultiColumn = 24 lastrow = GlobalVariables.oWb.Worksheets("sheet2").Cells(GlobalVariables.oWb.Worksheets("Sheet2").Rows.Count, 1).Row lbxResults.Items.AddRange(GlobalVariables.oWb.Worksheets("sheet2").Range("B1:B" &amp; lastrow, "A1:U21").Value) crange = rng.FindNext(crange) Loop While crange.Address &lt;&gt; firstaddress

that still has `Range("B1:B" &amp; lastrow, "A1:U21")` 
Yes, sorry, I adjusted it in the code; I had linked the code earlier in another reply and just copy pasted it from there - my mistake. 
seems like you need to convert the COM object range to a generic object. I've only done this stuff in vba and vb6, not sure if there's a better way for .net.
I don't assume there's a CObj() method lol
&gt; [gist](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/18599cee7b175b4052f6d33c857c727f) Yes, sorry. I didn't realize that it scrambled the formatting when I posted. I was frustrated and it was the last thing I did before leaving work last night. But here is the GIST file. The really confounding thing is, that it not only works sometimes, but sometimes when it doesn't, it'll start logging data 20-30 rows deep into the sheet for no apparent reason! I am new to all things code, but still, there isn't anything that should do that within the code I've written. 
I took out the Option buttons, so the With MFICHK.Cells bit is gone. It was pretty much pointless to have a yes or no question when the app autosaves the time of the submission. 
I have figured it out! Its so infuriating when you figure out the fix, and its totally easy. The [FIX](https://gist.github.com/kraxten/a103e197bf35f7695f05c7b586190577) And just added WS1. and WS2. before each cell line. Fixed, tested, and functional!
I'm not sure how much a BGW will help with this, but they are fairly simple to use. You'd put all of the code that starts, waits, and manages the process in the BGW.DoWork event, and the start it with the BGW.RunWorkerAsync call. If you need to pass any arguments to the DoWork event, there's an override that includes an "argument" object that is passed in via the e.argument property of the .DoWork event. Any code you want to execute when the BGW is done you put in the BGW.RunWorkerComplete event. In the DoWork event, the "e" parameter has the ability to .cancel the event, and a .result object that you can use to pass data to the RunWorkerComplete event (available in the e.result parameter of RunWorkerComplete).
youtube-dl.exe is a command line tool. You can't run it in a thread, it is its own process. Try something like this. Dim YoutubeProc As New Process With YoutubeProc .StartInfo.FileName = "C:\WhereEver\Youtube-dl.exe" .StartInfo.Arguments = "/arg=" &amp; SomeStuff &amp; " File.out" .StartInfo.WorkingDirectory = "C:\Temp" .Start() Do Until .HasExited Threading.Thread.Sleep(100) Loop End With 
If looks like you're trying to create a folder when the program launches (in LEAForm at line 9), and there's a permission error. What's the code in that form look like?
its just a simple Mkdir based off the user profile docs file i checked and the program is executing the Mkdir successfully even on the people who are crashing out; Line 9 specifically is just a Call for the Sub thats erroring out at 187. I included the code snippiet; Line 187 is the first Mkdir. (i replaced the file names with text gibberish fyi) User = Environ$("USERPROFILE") FPath = User &amp; "\Documents\sdsdsf\" UserID = Replace(User, "C:\Users\", "") If Len(Dir$(FPath)) = 0 Then MkDir(FPath) MkDir(FPath &amp; "XYZ") MkDir(FPath &amp; "SAF") MkDir(FPath &amp; "ASF") MkDir(FPath &amp; "CAA") MkDir(FPath &amp; "CAC") MkDir(FPath &amp; "FEA") MkDir(FPath &amp; "Application Resources") Call refreshguidelines() Call AppResourcesUpdate() Dim OutputPath As String = FPath &amp; "PH.txt" Dim ObjWriter As New System.IO.StreamWriter(OutputPath) ObjWriter.Write("PHFile Created " &amp; Today) ObjWriter.Close() End If 
[The documentation here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k1d22wfh.aspx) States that there are 3 exceptions mkdir is likely to throw. The one you are getting (IOException) occurs when the directory you are trying to create already exists. So could that be what is going on there? If so you should update the code to check for the directory before trying to create it. Also, I don't know how into updating this program you are, but you can use different methods, like My.Computer.FileSystem.CreateDirectory() That will throw no exceptions if called and the directory already exists. Also your top code to get the user and docs path can be modified to Dim FPath = IO.Path.Combine(My.Computer.FileSystem.SpecialDirectories.MyDocuments, "sdsdsf") Dim UserID = My.User.Name 
Was this a VB6 project that was converted? You're getting an access error, but it's hard to tell what it is from these legacy methods. This could be multiple things: the environment variable isn't what you expect or doesn't exist, your app doesn't have permissions to read or create a folder in the Users area ("Run as Admin" could cause this, as could restrictions on the user account), maybe the users documents folder isn't on the C drive?. Is it possible that the folders already exist from a previous run? I've never used MkDir, so I don't know how it deals with existing folders. I'd certainly update this to use the standard framework bits for getting the special folders, and for creating folders, as they'll better handle / report issues. I'd also move the folder creation to a separate sub, and call it once for each folder being created. That way you can add a try / catch in that sub, and handle / log each failure on it's own without crashing the app. At the least, you could pop up a window with the error message in the catch method. 
thats exactly what it was &lt;_&gt; i converted it three years ago and didnt care much about doing any updates since i'd left it behind a long ass time ago and could never get the approval to go back and update/maintenance it. found the issue btw- its apparently being caused because i had the program set to x64, but needed to be set to x32 for some people despite everyone being on cloned environments. 
i worked it out- it needed to be forced to X86 for some people despite everyone being on X64. i went back and fixed up some of the old VB6 methods that jumped out at me. like Hdsrob guessed, this was a coverted vb6 project that i flipped over 3 years ago, and didnt do much cleanup work onit. 
This is works for me and by 'works' I mean it steps through without error. Dim oQuery As Object oQuery = MusicPlayer.mediaCollection.createQuery() oQuery.addCondition("WM/Genre", "Equals", "Jazz") oQuery.addCondition("Author", "Contains", "Jim") Check this: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd562272(v=vs.85).aspx
Interesting. I guess I assumed if the method existed, it would appear in the intellisense dialog, or that I would have some way to define a Query-type object better than "As Object". But I will have to give this a shot.
Yeah, Activex control items have a habit of NOT showing up in intellisense.
are you using vb.net to automate powerpoint, or are using adding VBA macros to the pptm file? the latter is probably easier. it's probably possible to add the image as url and use a macro to tell it to refresh the images. I've really only done excel from vb, but I never found any shortage of examples one I got the terms right. (vb6/vb.net/vba, macro, OLE, and more) 
The only one I have in my ancient bookmarks is [Project Analyzer](http://www.aivosto.com/project/project.html) But it is stupid expensive.
It's for vba only, but try rubberduckvba? Or, you could copy the code into visual studio, and use resharper on it like it is vb.net. You'll prolly get some errors, but a lot of the syntax is similar so it may work? 
you do have to be careful with that kind of stuff in vb6 since it as a has a limited call stack (16 I think) , I can see blindly using Extract Method to its full potent maxing that out. IMO it's only worth extracting when the code is a re-use candidate. 
Don't completely remember everything that it had, but I used MZ Tools to handle lots of that stuff back in VB6 (I actually still use the modern version in VS today, mostly for it's code template feature).
Looks like you are assigning the grade point label a value, using if statements, after you are trying to do the calculations. Move the if statements to after you declare your variables. You are trying to set lblTotalGPointsOutput.Text a value before you assign values to lblGP1.Text + lblGP2.Text + lblGP3.Text + lblGP4.Text + lblGP5.Text The value is going to be zero so you are dividing by zero later in the code. 
VB6 does not have a "limited call stack of 16 calls". It can run out of stack space (same as any other language), but you can increase the base stack space with a badly documented linker argument. Even with the the basic stack space (1MB if I recall correctly) you're very unlikely to run out unless you have a recursion bug.
I would suggest this list http://samsoft.org.uk/iTunes/scripts.asp Will get you started. 
There's a remove duplicate function already in iTunes. No need to reinvent the wheel.
can you specify if you want to remove the duplicate without anything in the comment field?
I may not understand what you want. I think you want to check a user id/password against a local windows vs a domain? If so, something like this in C# will validate a userid/password against windows credentials using System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement; . . . bool valid = false; using (PrincipalContext context = new PrincipalContext(ContextType.Machine, machineName)) { valid = context.ValidateCredentials(userid, password); }
I'm sorry I forgot to include this was a vb.NET 2015 request. But yes I think you understand what I want. In order to access a specific feature on my program I'm requiring that the user re-authenticates themselves using their Windows Account password. If you could kindly translate that into vb.NET I'll give it a shot to see if it's what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!
My bad, I did not pay attention that this was a VB forum. Something like: Dim valid as Boolean; Dim PrincipalContext as new PrincipalContext(ContextType.Machine, machineName); valid = context.ValidateCredentials(userid, password);
This worked perfectly, thanks a ton!

Size of photo. btnPic.Image = Image.FromStream(xstream) End If 
 Dim Size as String Dim Thickness as String Dim Order(5) as String Dim Dine as String Select Case True Case SmallRadiobox.checked Size = "Small" Case MediumRadiobox.checked Size = "Medium" Case LargeRadiobox.checked Size = "Large" End Select Select Case True Case ThickRadiobox.Checked Thickness = "Thick" Case ThinRadiobox.Checked Thickness = "Thin" End Select Select Case True Case DineInRadiobox.Checked Dine = "Dine IN" Case TakeOutRadioBox.Checked Dine = "Take Out" End Select Select Case CheeseBox.Checked Case True Order(0) = "Cheese" End Select Select Case DblCheeseBox.Checked Case True Order(1) = "Double Cheese" End Select Select Case BeefBox.Checked Case True Order(2) = "Beef" End Select Select Case PeperoniBox.Checked Case True Order(3) = "Peperoni" End Select Select Case BaconBox.Checked Case True Order(4) = "Bacon" End Select Select Case ChickenBox.Checked Case True Order(5) = "Chicken" End Select Dim FullItem as string For i = 0 to 5 Select case Order(i) Case Nothing Case Else FullItem &amp;= Order(i) &amp; " " End Select Next Messagebox.Show(Size &amp; " " &amp; Thickness &amp; " " &amp; FullItem &amp; " " &amp; Dine) 
Yeah, in Button...or you can create you own sub-routine as Sub MyOrder ' Your Command Here End Sub Then Put it in your Button... 
 Private Sub Button01() MyOrder() End Sub
Put it outside of Button01 Dim Size As String Dim Thickness As String Dim Order(5) As String Dim Dine As String Dim FullItem As String And add this after the messagebox.show For c = 0 to 5 Order(c) = nothing Next Dine = Nothing Size = Nothing Thickness = Nothing FullItem = Nothing 
IMO, this is a job for an Enum: Private Enum Bosses BossAsylum BossTaurusDemon BossBellGargoyles BossCapraDemon BossGapingDragon BossMoonlightButterfly BossSif BossChaosWitchQuelaag BossStrayDemon BossIronGolem 'etc End Enum Then you can create a central "boss caller". Private Sub RunBoss(Boss As Bosses) Select Case Boss Case Bosses.BossAsylum BossAsylum() Case Bosses.BossTaurusDemon BossTaurusDemon() Case Bosses.BossBellGargoyles BossBellGargoyles() Case Bosses.BossCapraDemon BossCapraDemon() Case Bosses.BossGapingDragon BossGapingDragon() Case Bosses.BossMoonlightButterfly BossMoonlightButterfly() Case Bosses.BossSif BossSif() Case Bosses.BossChaosWitchQuelaag BossChaosWitchQuelaag() Case Bosses.BossStrayDemon BossStrayDemon() Case Bosses.BossIronGolem BossIronGolem() 'etc End Select End Sub or a threaded version (this could probably be handled better): Private Sub RunBossInThread(Boss As Bosses) Select Case Boss Case Bosses.BossBellGargoyles trd = New Thread(AddressOf BossBellGargoyles) Case Bosses.BossAsylum trd = New Thread(AddressOf BossAsylum) 'etc End Select trd.IsBackground = True trd.Start() End Sub Want to run all of the bosses: For n = 0 To 9 'hard coded to top of list RunBoss(CType(n, Bosses)) Next 'or For Each boss As Bosses In System.Enum.GetValues(GetType(Bosses)) RunBoss(boss) Next You can of course step through them backwards, generate a random number between 0 and bosses, generate a randomly filled array and then loop through it, etc. At this point you're just dealing with an integer to determine which boss to call. You can also set the tag on each button to an integer corresponding to the boss enum it should run, and create a single handler for all of the buttons: btnAsylum has its tag set to 0, and btnBellGargoyles has its tag set to 2. Private Sub btn_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnBellGargoyles.Click, btnAsylum.Click 'etc Dim b As Button = CType(sender, Button) Dim i As Integer = CInt(b.Tag) RunBossInThread(CType(i, Bosses)) End Sub 
That's definitely an improvement to my code and I'll likely include a variation of it in the near future. There are still some things I'm planning on doing that I think would be better accomplished at a lower level, but I'll work with this and deal with those when they're better thought out. Thanks.
Did you deleted the Dim FullItem as String after Select Case CheckBox6.Checked Case True Order(5) = "Chicken" End Select 
Then delete that one in line 64, if you already indicate/call the variable(FullItem) outside your Button01... hmmm... change the line 75 to FullItem &amp;= "-" &amp; Order(i) &amp; " " &amp; Environment.Newline and MessageBox.Show("Size:" &amp; Size &amp; Environment.Newline &amp; "Crust Type:" &amp; Thickness &amp; Environment.Newline &amp; "Topping" &amp; Environment.Newline &amp; FullItem &amp; Environment.Newline &amp; "*" &amp; Dine) 
Sure, with delegates, which you are actually already using when starting threads. Dim bossMethods as Action() = { AddressOf BossAsylum, AddressOf BossBedOfChaos, ... } bossMethods(0)() IMO the bosses might be better represented as individual classes inheriting from an abstract base class that contains the common logic and functionality, though. 
Oh, nice. I actually had no idea the Action type existed, and all other attempts to capture the AddressOf had failed. Thanks.
No problem, :D
 ' &amp;H80000000 Dim i As Integer = -2147483648 
The value in other locations of the file can be a non-zero float, and should be presented as a 0 in the datagridview. I may just end up having to do what you suggest and hardcode a "-0" into the display, then force the bytes to be written like that on save when "-0" is detected.
Negative zero is supported in the sense that .NET follows the IEEE spec for floating points, which says that `-0.0` equals `0.0`. You can create negative zero float constants by explicitly declaring them as `-0.0` or `-0F` (just `-0` won't work because integers don't have that distinction), but they'll be mostly indistinguishable from positive 0, especially when formatted as a string. You can detect a negative zero float by converting its representation to an integer first Dim value = -0F Dim isNegativeZero = value = 0 AndAlso BitConverter.DoubleToInt64Bits(value) = Int64.MinValue I suspect there's no direct way to get a datagridview to support this, you'll probably have to change it to a string column and manually convert the values and handle negative ones specially. 
Thanks, that's a better test than I'd have come up with.
Ok I added your code and it indicates the length of my stream is 32762. The Jpeg image I am using is 32K so that seems about right. Actual size is 30,978 bytes. Just some additional information. I have tried storing several different picture formats in the OLE Object. I have used BMP, a JPEG and a PNG. Thanks for the help!
[This link](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd383503\(v=vs.110\).aspx?cs-save-lang=1&amp;cs-lang=vb#code-snippet-1) will get you started.
What about a Listview? https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.listview.columns(v=vs.110).aspx
you would have to make the program print all the top lines one after the other, then print a carriage return and then print all the second lines. You might want to make a big string and then print the entire string at one time. For bonus points instead of printing strings of spaces, you could use numbers, using binary to code 1 for stars and 0 for spaces. 
How do I print only the top line?
you would do something like print "***** ***** ***** ***** *****" 
Let's take a couple of minutes and break down your problem into little pieces so you can understand how everything should come together. ---- * We can create one variable for storing the character our user inputs and call it `PyramidChar`. * Say we have a variable named `TotalLoops`. The purpose of this variable is to store how many times the user has requested our code to loop. * In order to loop anything, we need a variable which will increment from 0 to whatever `TotalLoops` is. So lets call this variable `LoopCounter`. * Now that we've established our main loop which will control the height of our pyramid, we'll need to have a way to keep track of the pyramid's width at each level. This would simply be another variable which increments each time `LoopCounter` goes from 0 to `TotalLoops`. We can call this `PyramidWidth`. * Now we know how wide our pyramid will be, but we need a way to create that width. This means we need a second looping variable to loop from 0 to whatever our `PyramidWidth` is at that time. We can call this `WidthLoop`. * Lastly, we'll need a temporary string to store our current pyramid level in before printing it. We can call this `PyramidString`. * Now that we have all the pieces of our puzzle, we'll need to put it together. ---- Note: I'm stuck with sort of using VB pseudocode as my desktop is currently MIA and am stuck with my work laptop to produce code, and it doesn't have VS, so if there are any errors, I apologize. ---- Option Explicit Private Sub MakePyramid() 'This code has no error correction or checking so be warned, you will need to debug things if you encounter errors ;] 'I'm declaring variables before I use them, but you can also declare variables immediately as you need them Dim PyramidChar As String, PyramidString As String Dim TotalLoops As Long, LoopCounter As Long Dim PyramidWidth As Long, WidthLoop As Long Console.WriteLine ("Enter the character your Pyramid will be comprised of") PyramidChar = Console.ReadLine() Console.WriteLine ("How tall will your Pyramid be?") TotalLoops = Console.ReadLine() For LoopCounter = 0 To TotalLoops PyramidWidth += 1 For WidthLoop = 1 To PyramidWidth PyramidString = PyramidString &amp; PyramidChar &amp; " " Next WidthLoop Console.WriteLine (PyramidString &amp; " ") PyramidString = "" Next LoopCounter End Sub 
You can't multiply a character by an integer like you're doing in: lblDisplay.Text = lblDisplay.text &amp;vbcrlf &amp; ((ilevls)*txtbxchar.Text) So you want to put another loop into your current loop. The first while loop goes through each line, the second while lopp generates the line. Something like this: While iLevels &lt;= nudnumlevels.value dim numCharacters as integer = 1 while numcharacters &lt;= ilevels lbldisplay.text = lbldisplay.text &amp; txtbxchar.text &amp; " " numcharacters +=1 End While lblDisplay.text = lbldisplay.text &amp; vbcrlf iLevels +=1 End While This might work exactly as is but I'm pretty sure you'll need to polish it up a bit.
 Console.write("text") will print a line with now newline after it. I don't think print works in vb
Great Answer!
Btw, [this](http://converter.telerik.com/) page is very handy for converting between C# and VB.Net 
You may want to answer/u/Abbotn directly, otherwise i think he won't get a notification. And regarding your 1=2 switch, did you know you can do something like: #If (DEBUG) Then System.Diagnostics.Debug.Print("Tick Begin") #End If This code will only run if your starting debug mode, in release mode it is ignored.
Awesome, this looks like what I'm looking for. Thank you!
Thanks, this is something I never new about!
Assuming we're talking about VB.NET, look up "reflection". `Type.GetMethods()` etc.
Looks like what I'm wanting, I'll read up on it. Thanks.
No it doesn't sorry I should have specified that was just pseudo code to get it going in the right direction.
so if you run the script, then run it again, it changes both? if you do it manually it's the same? sendkeys just does the same as typing on the keyboard. so first figure out of typing it behaves the same. if it does not you may have a timing issue and need to add some delay code (sleep? a short loop? IDK vbs's best option there)
Works perfectly. Looks like a bit of handling needed to be sure the parameters are all in order, but overall quite simple. Thanks.
Create an array of eligible characters (letters, numbers, symbols that are okay, etc.), generate a random number between 1 and the number of characters, and select the item in the array corresponding with your random number. Do over as many times as you want for length.
Thanks you explained it well! But can you explain in code how do i generate a random number and select? or send me a link? Thanks! Sorry if im bothering
A little web searching should find you any help you need completing any part of this. For instance, here's making a random number: http://www.visual-basic-tutorials.com/3162010215916.php Happy cake day, by the way!
Thanks so much!
Sorry to bother again, I've done it all and learned how to create random strings of letters and numbers, but how can i create a random date? I've been looking online alot now and i cant find any, can you help?
Why not? You'd probably want to specify a range of ages.
I guess from 1950 to current time, if thats what you meant
Hi, you can use this: Function RandomString(cb As Integer) As String Randomize Dim rgch As String rgch = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" rgch = rgch &amp; UCase(rgch) &amp; "0123456789" Dim i As Long For i = 1 To cb RandomString = RandomString &amp; Mid$(rgch, Int(Rnd() * Len(rgch) + 1), 1) Next End Function
Hmmmm... I've never had to do that. If I was looking for a random date/time, I'd look at Unix Timestamps. They're integers representing every second since January 1st, 1970. (Currently, it's about 1501617629.) You could create a random number between the earliest and latest UTC timestamps that you want to be selected, and then convert from there. This is a simple example on UTC conversion: http://www.colincochrane.com/post/converting-a-unix-timestamp-to-system-datetime You may also, depending on what you need, need to convert to local time (or it may not matter for your program), so it's worth looking at the DateTime structure and what properties and functions are available for it, like ToLocalTime() and AddSeconds(). 
Thanks this looks really nice! i've Modified something online (and claimed it as my version lol) but its a bit complicated Randomize() Number = Int(Rnd() * 62) + 1 Characters = GetChar(Letters, Number) TB_FirstName.Text = TB_FirstName.Text + "" + Characters If TB_FirstName.TextLength = 8 Then FirstName.Enabled = False SecondName.Enabled = True End If Note: I'm using a timer to create a 8 letters long Name
I was thinking of more of an age range -- 18 to 36 -- if you're trying to generate a random group of people with believable personal information.
I was trying to think if we can go simpler, but it depends on what date range you're looking for. I mean, you can random 1-12 for the month, and random 1-31 for the day of the month, etc. Which seems simpler, but then you have to actually check which month you picked and then randomly select the day from the number of days in that month (28, 29, 30, or 31), including checking if it's a leap year. The advantage of doing the Unix Timestamp conversion method, is the operating system handles all of the date intelligence for you.
Thanks for your help, ill try to understand all of this :P 
Yeah that would be better, From 18 to 30 or even less
i thought of the same thing at the beggining but everytime i try to mess with dates in visual basic i get a headache of all the calculations i have to create
that is correct, if I run my first script twice then both screens are changed (one gets changed each time I run it). The issue is setting the active window. To run this script, I have to double click on the script's icon on my Desktop. If I omit my "problem line" in my second script then Windows gets confused and runs lines 1-4 correctly but when it reaches line 6 onwards it thinks that I am trying to SHIFT + F10 (aka right click) the desktop icon, NOT the actual desktop. The result is that it pops up the right click menu on the icon which is an entirely different menu than if I right click on the desktop (what I want to do). The result is that the second part of the script does not execute correctly. My F5 solution fixes this problem BUT it causes my desktop icons to refresh (blink) which I am trying to avoid.
Hello there! I've been googling and i found this online, thought i would share it with you, https://www.experts-exchange.com/questions/23909937/VB-NET-Getting-random-date-that-falls-between-specific-M-D-Y-range.html Can you explain it to me?
try replacing F5 with ctrl spacebar. trying manually this toggles the selected item.
Grouse, the code went straight in. Thanks for pointing out where I went wrong. Cheers buddy.
This is awesome, thankyou!
if 1950 is your epoch, generate a random number between 0 and [datediff() of now and 1950 in days]. dateadd those days to 1950. 
Dont bother generating days, months and years separately. Just us datediff. + take the todays date and using datediff minus off the earliest date you would consider eg 1st january 1930.This will give you an Int value of the total amount of days from that point to now. Call this X + create a random number between 0 and X. + use datediff to add that number to the earliest date you want. 
Is the correct answer.
That's pretty simple, and probably a lot easier than mine! It's figuring out the difference between the two dates, getting a random number between one and the difference, and then adding the random result back to the original date to get the random date in between those dates. DateDiff() is the key function there, one I've never used personally: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b5xbyt6f(v=vs.90).aspx
That does work but the new issue is that windows plays the [background sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsFagl7XeTc) when I do this. If there was a way of doing this without the sound then I'd be set. Again, thanks for your help with this :)
you're kinda stuck since there's no API for this. maybe switch to a 3rd party app to manage the backgrounds...
fair enough. Thanks again for the help :)
OOOOOOOOOOH I figured out the problem. I was misunderstanding the way the code is written. The line WshShell.SendKeys("^ ") is CTRL + Space and is used to deselect the icon once it has been clicked on. The error in my original code is that I left this line in when I copy/pasted the replicated part of the code. This part should only be executed once. Thus, the correct way to run this script is: set WshShell = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell") WshShell.SendKeys("^ ") WshShell.SendKeys("+{F10}") WshShell.SendKeys("n") WshShell.SendKeys("+{F10}") WshShell.SendKeys("n")
Also look at the CallByName method. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/chsc1tx6(v=vs.90).aspx
Its not to hard, ill look into it when i get home

Okay, on the top of your code (higher than Public Class "Name") Put: Imports System.IO On the save-file button: SaveFileDialog1.ShowDialog() Dim fs As FileStream = File.Create(SaveFileDialog1.FileName &amp; ".txt") fs.Close() Using Writer As StreamWriter = New StreamWriter(SaveFileDialog1.FileName &amp; ".txt") Writer.WriteLine(TextBox1.Text) End Using Using Reader As StreamReader = New StreamReader(SaveFileDialog1.FileName &amp; ".txt") My.Settings.ASetting = Reader.ReadToEnd End Using Using Writer As StreamWriter = New StreamWriter(SaveFileDialog1.FileName &amp; ".txt") Writer.Write(My.Settings.ASetting) Writer.WriteLine(TextBox2.Text) End Using Replace ASetting with the setting you made for this. If you have not made a setting goto Project "Name" Properties Settings. Hope it helps, i have not tested this. If you have ANY errors please let me know and ill fix them for ya. EDIT: Just noticed you asked for a RTF format. Just replace the ".txt" with ".rtf" or whatever you need. You can even put ".myfile" and i will still work

Hmm, I suppose I could utilize that to run a separate version of my application... So I'll keep that in mind but it's not quite what I'm looking for. Basically what I'm looking for is to have my program interact as if I'd created it as a Console Application. Accept input, run my program's functions based on that input, output console.writeline to it... *But* only function like that within a single tab of a larger Windows Forms project.
Pseudocoding off the top of my head. txt = file.readline() for each pair in txt.split(";") array1.add(pair.split(",")(0) array2.add(pair.split(",)(1) next Helpful, or need more?
Thanks too much for sharing :) i will try it now
all i have a problem in now is that setError is not declared. It may be inaccessible due to its protection level.
I'll have a look at it. Thanks.
if by script you mean vba, this isn't really the right place. VBA is visual basic for applications, and this forum is for visual basic.
Style a multiline textbox to make it look like a console and make its parent the tab (or dock, if in winforms).
You could do a linq query. Probably be the simplest way. Dim price As Integer price = allSales.Sum(Function(item) item.Price) 
The problem is not with the first sub but with the second sub.
I have tried your code and it works as expected for my own account. Is it possible that you are not "Eileen Collins"? My guess is as permission issue or something similar.
this is false. read the sidebar.
by "rename in in right order" do you mean pad the name with zeros so Explorer sorts by name in the expected way? I don't really do much of anything with files in vba, but this shouldn't be too hard. start by reading in your text file, use `explode()` to separate the names into an array, loop the array and print each name. once that works, use the format function with "000" for the format, or "0000" if you plan on having more than 999 files later, and print the original and the formated values side by side. finally, add the file rename function.
Hun you are correct.
So 208 wav files and text with name separated by dots. * Are the names in the text file in one record? * Do you want to rename the files to the names in the text file?
This is part of some code I wrote to read and parse a CSV. Dim CurrentRow As String() Dim CSVFileReader As TextFieldParser CSVFileReader = New TextFieldParser(sInFile) With {.TextFieldType = FieldType.Delimited, .Delimiters = {","}} While Not CSVFileReader.EndOfData CurrentRow = CSVFileReader.ReadFields() ' Move a CSV record into array If Not CurrentRow Is Nothing Then ' Do the work here. End If End While CSVFileReader.Close() 
also, neither of your examples are CSV. CSVs are like ABC, 123 DEF, 456 GHI, 789
What "Console functionality?" DOS, VT100 or are you planning to devise your own CLI?
https://github.com/Wulf2k/DaS-BRush/blob/master/DaS-BRush/Form1.vb#L534 https://github.com/Wulf2k/DaS-BRush/blob/master/DaS-BRush/Form1.vb#L2657 Basically the user would type something like "SetDisableGravity True" and the program parses the line and calls the "SetDisableGravity" function while passing it "True" as the first parameter. In the code above, it's calling a mix of functions that I've created myself, and ones that already exist within the game code that it hooks into.
I expect something like this would work, but maybe somebody can give it a once over. I've probably screwed up something or other. Set objFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject") Set objFile = objFSO.OpenTextFile("C:\files.txt", 1) strContents = objFile.ReadAll names = split(strContents, ".") set oFldr = objFSO.getfolder("c:\folderwithfiles\") for i = 0 to uBound(names) - 1 oFldr.files(i).name = names(i) &amp; ".abc" next Edit: Wait, there's no guarantee here that the files in the array will be in proper sort order. a check would need to be added there.
I see, so you're devising an app specific CLI. I don't know of any free controls or APIs that would give a rudimentary console window. That would be pretty handy. It's also very difficult to search for what you're looking for because there's a ton of crap related to the CLI/Terminal/Console window of visual studio. Here's an example, seems to use two textboxes. https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/14908/Command-Prompt-Control I think you're stuck with a multiline textbox and creative string manipulation.
That one looks pretty interesting, and far better than I'd have expected something made from 2 textboxes to be. For now I think I'll just leave it as an ugly multiline textbox with an execute button and a separate output, then circle back once I'm happy with everything else. Thanks for the response.
So you can use .Distinct to get a list of colors, and then use .Where to filter sales by color. Once filtered, you can then use .Sum to add up what you need. Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Dim Colors = (From aSale In allSales Select aSale.SmartMobile.Color).Distinct 'make a list of distinct colors Dim Report As String = "" For Each Color In Colors 'iterate through all colors Dim MatchingColors As List(Of Sales) = allSales.Where(Function(s) s.SmartMobile.Color = Color).ToList 'make a list of sales with matching colors Dim TotalPrice As Double = MatchingColors.Sum(Function(s) s.SmartMobile.Price * s.SmartMobile.Quantity) 'add up the total price Dim TotalQuantity As Double = MatchingColors.Sum(Function(s) s.SmartMobile.Quantity) 'add up total quantity Report += "Color" + vbTab + Color + vbTab + "Number" + vbTab + TotalQuantity.ToString + vbTab + "Total Price" + vbTab + TotalPrice.ToString + vbTab + vbNewLine 'add row to the report Next MsgBox(Report) End Sub
It's just weird because every other WindowsMediaPlayer related object I use was in IntelliSense. Just not queries. Finally got around to testing this in my code and it works great.
Instead of an 'execute button', you could use one of the keydown or keypress events and look for a CR. Something like this. Private Sub TextBox2_KeyDown(sender As Object, e As KeyEventArgs) Handles TextBox2.KeyDown Dim aCmds() As String Dim sLastCmd As String If e.KeyCode = Keys.Enter Then aCmds = TextBox2.Text.Split(vbCrLf) sLastCmd = aCmds(aCmds.Length - 1) MsgBox(sLastCmd) End If End Sub 
What you're asking for is *not* novice programming. The main issue you'll face is when someone who does not have Excel installed but still wants to use your .exe. You have to write this using an API you can use and freely distribute. I use Spire to work with Excel Workbooks without having Excel installed. https://www.e-iceblue.com/Introduce/free-xls-component.html#.WYRdYNLru9I 
Is the data simple enough that it could be saved as a CSV instead of an Excel sheet? This makes the data much more portable without having to worry if each machine has excel installed. Also, converting an array of data in excel in to an array hardcoded in your application isn't terribly difficult if you wanted to go that route.
yes the data is only numerical values. So if i put the data into CSV form, it will be portable?
Yeah, it allows you to use the TextFieldParser class instead of having to tie in to Excel Com Components. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.visualbasic.fileio.textfieldparser(v=vs.110).aspx
Okay great, thank you so much!
That seems like a useful way of doing it. In the meantime it's become a bit of a feature, building entire scripts in the textbox before executing them. I think I'll add a checkbox toggle between live execution via the enter key and script-building via the execute button. Thanks. If you're interested in seeing it in its current state, here's a video - https://youtu.be/ukOrLzN5pC8 Unless you're interested in the game itself you'll see everything relevant in the first minute, but it's working rather well so far.
I'm just curious on what the use case for this is.
I'm sorry. But I'm going to need some punctuation? 
Here's a grab bag of punctuation just for you! ; , . ` ? ¿ 
loop the first dimension, basically the same way you populated it, testing to see if the code is the right, then grab the other admissions if it is.
A tab in what program?
In my opinion the better way is to use stored procedures. That way all the database operations happen on the database instead of you having to run multiple queries to get a bunch of information across the network only to send it all back in a different form. But I know stored procedures aren't cool anymore...
Okay. So i use stored procedures also but they are for much more involved calculations and things of that sort. Are you saying I should create a stored procedure or 4 to pull the data? And more to my original point, if I used 4 different stored procedures, is it better to use 1 command and reassign the stored procedure or is there a different way of doing it? Thanks for you thoughts BTW.
I have no idea, but from the sounds of it you do a bunch of queries to get some data then you act on that data. If all of that can be done in a single stored procedure then it probably should be (or a set of stored procedures called by one). There's no rule that stored procedures have to be complex. There's nothing wrong with a 2-line stored proc just like there's nothing wrong with a 2-line VB function. My philosophy is to keep the database work in the database as much as possible. But I'm also a SQL guy which is rare in these days of frameworks.
I gotcha. I understand what you mean. It would make sense to do a stored procedure and just populate a dataset with the information to assign variables from there. 
you only need 1 command object, once you execute the command, the data context is transferred to the resultset object and you are free to reuse the command. you may find it useful to keep multiple resultset objects, but it's also common to just pull what you need into local vars and reuse that too.
A stored procedure can have multiple queries within in, each query can be accessed using the NextResult() function.
Thank you so much! sorry for the late reply i didnt have a computer nearby! ill give it a try and tell you
I should also mention that the movie information (Title, Year, Length, Rating) is stored in 4 separate arrays located in a module. 
Why not post all the relevant parts?
Okay, I just did. Sorry, my first time here. 
 ReDim strTitles(mCount + 1) ReDim intYears(mCount + 1) ReDim intLengths(mCount + 1) ReDim strRatings(mCount + 1) That may extend the arrays, but also deletes the current values, i.e. creates a new array. Use ReDim Preserve instead. lstMovies.SetSelected(lstMovies.FindString(title), True) Kind of weird way to do that. The SelectedIndex and SelectedItem properties are not read-only. Replace it with lstMovies.SelectedItem = title if there are no duplicates. Otherwise lstMovies.SelectedIndex = lstMovies.Items.Length - 1
I literally just figured that out as soon as you responded. Thanks, DatMarv! :)

Nice! I'm gonna have a play with the bingo boxes.
You're going to need to know when the command prompt has finished. You can use "standard redirection" to get output from the cmd window. if it matches a certain string for example you can then use that in your VB app to say triggerr a close event or whatever sub routine you like. I did a little program that makes use of standard redirect as an example. I'll find it and post link here. 
I was thinking even appending like &amp;&amp; exit to the end of the end of the command string and hoping for the best. I'll test that too and let you know. 
ok. heres the link to the code example i posted. if nothing else it's a handy trick to know. https://www.reddit.com/r/visualbasic/comments/5f8kf2/adding_a_cmd_command_inside_a_vb_button/daiu51i/ ps. sorry for the formatting of the excerpt

This is wrong: If StrComp(objAppointment, strName, 1) = 0 Then The objAppointment is not a string. Perhaps you mean: If StrComp(objAppointment.subject, strName, 1) = 0 Then
Thank you that worked!
Now if only we could get some perlin noise libraries.
If you have template documents, my approach would be as follows: Add a macro to a primary creation document that contains a form that allows you to input requisite information. Propagate the inputs to the documents as required. Have each edited document be saved as to the target folder, then discard the changes to the templates. To answer your question about when execution would occur, it would happen when you opened your primary document and ran the macro. You may also want to look into how bookmarks work with VBA and Word so that you can create named regions for your inputs to be loaded.
Really, either VBA or VB.net will work, but I recommend .net since it is more modern and you can do a lot more with it. VB.net should be essentially the same code as VBA with only a few minor changes. Either way, it is a pretty simple process to loop through a bunch of files and add info in specific places. Feel free to PM me for any specific help! I'm still learning a little myself, but I have a lot of word and excel automation experience in both VBA and .net
Great! I liked you solve it!
I would suggest using Word's mail merge features for this. you make your documents with special placeholders that the mailmerge tool fills in from a spreadsheet of the values. it has the option to email them, but I believe you can also just save them. then maybe script the mailmerge features to streamline it.
&gt; Think about what Visual Basic is like to someone who speaks only Chinese I spent 11 months in China and every developer I met in China knew English. The only reason C* has a greater following is because it was, for the most part, the only game in town for PC development in the late 80's and 90's. And therefore, the only thing taught in colleges. In most corporate environments, interoperability and cross platform development does not happen. C# does not have more resources than VB. It's Visual Studio, they both have the same access to .NET and there's free APIs and source code on internet for anything. The fact is C# is not any more or less modern as the poster suggested. AND it IS in fact, just bad English compounded with bad punctuation. So, max out your chill and just enjoy my flippant joke as it was written.
There was no question. Just because you put a question mark at the end of a sentence doesn't make it a question. Apparently your English is just as bad as your punctuation. The C languages suck because case-sensitivity and semi-colons. If you need that much reading material to learn a language, then maybe that language is a piece of shit. I started writing code in the 80's, VAX Basic and MACRO32 machine code. Then used VBA in Excel, there is no C built into Office, and Visual Basic. Now I use VB in Visual Studio. One thing I've learned after almost 30 years, no one gives a shit what language you use. What matters is the developer environment and on Windows, Visual Studio is the best. In my shop we have 10 Java programmers and 2 VB, I code circles around those noobs. Every. Day. Why? Because Visual Studio, SQL Server and IIS. I've been having these stupid arguments like this about VMS and Unix, C&amp;lt;whatever&gt; and VB for decades and frankly - fuck off. No one cares. I'm sick of it. 
You really have very little real world experience to be talking about this.
Of course *you* would say that.
What has the panel to do with any of this? - Nothing I suppose. Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load For i = 1 To numberOfButtons AddHandler Controls("Button" &amp; i).Clicked, AddressOf buttonsClicked() Next End Sub Private Sub buttonsClicked(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) 'Some code applicable for every button 'address specific button via sender If sender.Equals(Button1) Then 'some code for Button1 End If End Sub 
You can have one click routine for many controls. Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As System.Object, e As RibbonControlEventArgs) Handles _ GW_Create.Click, GW_Delete.Click, GW_GetStatus.Click, GW_Enable.Click, GW_Activate.Click, GW_Disable.Click, GW_Deactivate.Click, GW_GetAlarms.Click, GW_SetModel.Click, GW_GetCMTS.Click, GW_GetFirst.Click, AD_Create.Click, AD_Delete.Click, AD_GetStatus.Click, AD_Enable.Click, AD_Activate.Click, AD_Disable.Click, AD_Deactivate.Click, AD_GetGW.Click, SL_Create.Click, SL_Delete.Click, SL_GetStatus.Click, SL_Enable.Click, SL_Disable.Click, SL_GetSuspend.Click, SL_SetLineClassCodes.Click, SL_SetSuspend.Click, SL_GetLineClassCodes.Click, SL_GetExport.Click, SL_SetPbxCharge.Click, SL_GetAD.Click, SL_GetGW.Click, SL_GetLastActivity.Click, SL_GetExport.Click, SL_GetNumberStatus.Click, SL_GetSwitch.Click, SL_GetCustomerInformation.Click, SL_SetCustomerInformation.Click Then use a case statement on the control name to call the functions. 
That is like saying you built a house and want it to drive on rail tracks like a train now. Just wtf, honestly. I don't know about the right language for you, but you won't succeed with VB like this.
This comment didn't really help with anything, but are you trying to say you can't put a VB application to run on an HTML page, but in a more condescending way? Guess my 2 days of Visual Basic has me with a few questions. My bad.
Rather in an illustrative way. What would you recommend for me if I asked you the thing with the house on rail tracks? It's just hard to answer since we only know that you have created some VB program. Is it a window application, what is its functionality, what interfaces to libraries did you use, did you access some resources of your OS etc. Then there may be someone around who could give you a lookalike as a web based implementation, if your specifications allow it. &gt; Guess my 2 days of Visual Basic has me with a few questions In which languages have you coded before?
It is a window application. I apologize if my terms are loose or incorrect in how I explain things here.. It's a simple app with a button that does calculations from inputs the user gives it using equations I built. It doesn't open anything or pull data from any other source except from what the user inputs in it's textboxes. I only used built in functions from VB in this program (mostly just casting functions). If Visual Basic isn't the best language for what I am describing, would you mind recommending a different language that I can use to build a GUI type interface to use on a web page? I have done coding with Java, C, and SQL before but it has been about a decade since I last used either, and I was far from an expert with them. 
Try ASP. And it depends on what server you have. You'd need a Windows server to run ASP. You are best probably writing it as a PHP script if you have a Linux server.
Convert your exe to a DLL and call the DLL via ASP. Google "embed vb.net into webpage"
VB.NET is the language, but there are multiple frameworks within .NET that can be used to build different types of applications (desktop, mobile, web, etc). Due to the way that these different technologies work, you have to use different tools to build them, but can still use the same language (VB). So the syntax will be the same, and much of the code will be similar, but you'll use some different concepts, and some different tools and workflows. So no, you can't convert a desktop app into a web page, but VB can be used to build a web page. ASP.NET is the tool you'd use to build a website with VB.NET. I'd start here: https://www.asp.net/learn Personally, I'd probably start with the MVC or Web Pages link in the "Which one is right for me" section. 
Or just copy the code into an ASP.NET file. It will work exactly the same way. 
Thanks for the replies and suggestions everyone. Will try this out tomorrow and see where it gets me.
the graphical browser control? IE.
Do you know if there's a way to change the user agent?
I don't know. you can also try using cefsharp instead if you want it to be Chromium/webkit.
Thank you!
Ok, so I modified the files as follows. [List of files](https://i.imgur.com/icKIQhB.png) [appcontext.vb](https://pastebin.com/5nuDQN4g) [compile.bat](https://pastebin.com/VS1T9px0) Control Panel2.ico [LaunchApp.vb](https://pastebin.com/TEBm4FfH) [Resources.resx](https://pastebin.com/Cggc9ntn) [Resources.vb](https://pastebin.com/LqSBzzBZ) Now this compiles but fails when starting https://i.imgur.com/hCGBp1P.png and it's complaining about missing resource At this time my .resx file and .ico file are not compiled in the exe and I'm not sure yet how to do it. 
Just tried adding the .resx and .ico files to the /resource of my compiler command like this VBC /OUT:app.exe /resource:appicon.ico /resource:Resources.resx /T:exe *.vb this compiles but still the resource is missing (and I renamed the .ico in the resx file) 
I believe you need to convert the `.resx` to a `.resources` file with `resgen.exe` first.
Thanks, I thought that would be handled by vbc So I tried running resgen At first it failed because my bare bone resx file was missing "resheader" whatever that is C:\Users\admin\Desktop\vb\bare systray app v2&gt;resgen Resources.resx Resources.resx : error RG0000: ResX input is not valid. Cannot find valid "reshe ader" tags for the ResX reader and writer type names. 1 error(s). So I went back to the original file and copied the following section https://pastebin.com/cuYXZZJz Now I've got a "[Resources.resources](https://i.imgur.com/PXarI45.png)" file which is the same size as the appicon file So I changed my [compile.cmd](https://pastebin.com/MmbXJFZ5) to add the /resource:Resources.resources flag My exe grew by 158kb, the size of the .ico file so that's a good sign ! But that fails on launch :( Here is the error [ERROR](https://pastebin.com/wgr2GpxG) Here is my project as it exists [Files](https://i.imgur.com/7byWeNp.png) [appcontext.vb](https://pastebin.com/AwGJqHyT) [compile.bat](https://pastebin.com/Wt4KH7xr) [LaunchApp.vb](https://pastebin.com/p2UaWTq8) [Resources.resx](https://pastebin.com/9wU0D0jU) [Resources.vb](https://pastebin.com/pFLPfana) EDIT: Ah, the issue might be the following line Dim temp As Global.System.Resources.ResourceManager = New Global.System.Resources.ResourceManager("TrayApp.Resources", GetType(Resources).Assembly) I don't think it should be "TrayApp.Resources" I'll try Resources.resources EDIT2: So I changed the line to Dim temp As Global.System.Resources.ResourceManager = New Global.System.Resources.ResourceManager("Resources.resources", GetType(Resources).Assembly) And that changed the error to Make sure "Resources.resources.resources" was correctly embedded EDIT3: That worked !! Dim temp As Global.System.Resources.ResourceManager = New Global.System.Resources.ResourceManager("Resources", GetType(Resources).Assembly) 
Looks like you are generating a list. Consider using listbox or you can use String.format to format your string before output
You can use a timer object, this way your form will be still responsive when serial port is sending message. 
NOTE: Above I say that I have PublicKeyToken=null in my resx file However that is a change I made just before posting this while trying to find and fix What I had before was PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a resgen does not work with PublicKeyToken=null for some reason, nor with PublicKeyToken="null" However, visual studio has no trouble building a .resource file with PublicKeyToken=null Now I have put back the b03f5f7f11d50a3a tokens and it does not fix the issue The app still compiles fine from both visual studio and compile.cmd however it only works from compile.cmd
I place the project as it currently exist on github https://github.com/shodanx2/systrayv2
I haven't looked into the String.Format function before - can strings there be formated in the way that I described?
https://bytes.com/topic/visual-basic-net/answers/386463-string-format-used-make-columns 
Thanks, I'll take a look at that :)

Hey, I hope im not too late to the party. What you want to do requires a lot of diffrent components, but its a great project to learn. For loading in the picture, the *System.IO* namespace has a few great classes. Nameley the *[DirectoryInfo](https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/system.io.directoryinfo\(v=vs.110\).aspx)* and *FileInfo* You can create a DirectoryInfo for a path (if you want the user to select the path, have a look at *[FolderBrowserDialogs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/system.windows.forms.folderbrowserdialog\(v=vs.110\).aspx)*) and then use the *EnumerateFiles()* method to get all files as *FileInfo*, which allow you to acces a lot of Info about them very easily. You can even do some patternmatching like *EnumerateFiles(**.png) to get all files ending in .png for example. The next usefull class you can use is the *[Image](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.drawing.image\(v=vs.110\).aspx)* class. Have a look at its static *FromFile()* method. The *PictureBox* controll has a *Image* property you can set to an instance of an image, so it will be displayed. You can also create an event for all your PictureBoxes that fire when you click on one (Just doublepress the PictureBox in the Form designer and the Sub for it should get created). Here you can handle the setting of the big PictureBox. For printing, have a look at the *[PrintDialog](https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/system.windows.forms.printdialog\(v=vs.110\).aspx)* Class, it functions a lot like the *FolderBrowserDialog* from before. MS should handle the rest. Regarding the flow of your program, I´d do something like this: 1. Open the FolderBrowserDialog and let the user pick what he wants 2. Create a DirectoryInfo, do some checking and get all files with *EnumerateFiles* 3. Create a List of Arrays of the type *Image* and go in a loop, allways 6 images get put in a Array that gets added to the List 4. Now you just need one integer to keep track of what "block" of images you are displaying 5. The click event on one of the PictureBoxes on the bottom, sets the *Image* property of the top PictureBox to the value of the clicked one. Now if the user wants to Print, you can just take the Image from the top box 6.
In VB.NET, overflow checking is a project-wide option in the project's compilation settings. Also, the `^` operator is *exclusive or* in C-style languages but exponentiation in VB. You actually want `x = x Xor ...` to get the same result. &gt;I am unsure of what exactly UINT64_C in the original source is doing. In C, the size of integers depends on the platform the code is compiled for. So a "long" integer isn't always 64 bit wide like it is in .NET. The macro appends the correct suffix ("unsigned long" or "unsigned long long") to the constant to make sure it really is 64 bits even on a 32 bit platform.
Thank you. That sets me in a better direction.
The net effect is that it is getting everything but the first five characters of a string. 
Thank you for the reply! I have been doing some research and have found some stuff to work with, but nothing as well laid out as your response. I appreciate it! I'll get started and see what I can come up. Will let you know if I have any more questions. Thanks again!
What I would do is run some google searches like what you want and look on the HTML for a piece of string before the definition that is there on all the results. for instance, I typed in "define pineapple" and came up with this: pine·ap·ple ˈpīˌnapəl/Submit noun 1. a large juicy tropical fruit consisting of aromatic edible yellow flesh surrounded by a tough segmented skin and topped with a tuft of stiff leaves. 2. the widely cultivated tropical American plant that bears this fruit. It is low-growing, with a spiral of spiny sword-shaped leaves on a thick stem. So what I would do is look for the first 1. in the html data returned and then collect the data from there on. You'll have to figure out where the data ends as well, so look for a 2. or maybe the word translations.
See if the Regex patterns in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/5xl8qv/macro_to_google_meaning_of_words_and_paste_ms/dejud7c/) match up to what you're getting back from Google. The VBA code in that post does exactly what you're already trying to do. Only thing that would break this is firewalls, and Google changing their output.
Okay, I did this: For whatever reason though, it won't allow me to access System.Data.Range as it is a 'friend." Are there any viable substitutes?
No, this was just showing you the regex and parsing, you don't have to literally use Excel objects.
Sorry, lol I'm still a noob with this kind of thing. I've been programming for three years, and there are still millions of things I don't know, as is the case with programming, lol.
I did something like this once with a music player I made one time. After ever ten songs, a text-to-speech DJ would pipe up and read the news and weather, along with some random banter. The program would download the results page from news.google.com, and I had to parse the HTML to extract the headlines to send to the speech reader. "And now the news... Bush attends baseball game in New York..." (It was in the early 2000s). For your project, you'd probably do the same thing, except use all the String class functions to parse out the definitions you want from the HTML of the search results. You have to read through the HTML and find the exact point where the text you want begins, and look for keywords to search for to let the program know this is where to start extracting. That's a whole nightmare in itself, and they you have to hope Google doesn't change it's format at all and bugger up your project in the future. 
thank you, i ended up using a timer object.
I think maybe i need drivers or something, we are using a uDac in electronics project, and the professor gave us the line of code. Any ideas anyone?
You probably need some sort of third-party library. Just ask your professor?
Hey something like this? edrapi.lib Found it online but don't know how to use it. Concerning the professor, its due tomorrow and i wont see him before then.
Did you even try to look it up? The first 3 results point to a manual of an API and the Download page for said API [here](http://www.eagledaq.com/download/index/id/7) with the top entry being a download for dotNET. I guess that could be wat you need.
Are you working with some data acquisition hardware ?
If you already got your "EDREApi" DLL from the internet... just ADD it in your "REFERENCE", It will automatically connect the class to your "EDREApi" DLL.
That's because in Windows there is always a drive OR network path. "This PC" is neither of these values. If you highlight the path in Windows Explorer you should be able to see the actual drive and path
Your camera is probably connected via WPD/MTP. MTP devices are not mounted as actual drives, and cannot be accessed via normal file IO/paths. There is a way to access these devices via Windows' `PortableDeviceApi`, but getting that to work in C# is non-trivial.

Hi again, I'm a little stuck. I have it set up to allow the user to select the folder path. But when the path is selected, I do not know how to get the files displayed, or where they can be displayed (in the style like the box in the picture I showed). Any suggestions? Thank you!
 Manual.Left = ((MyBase.Size.Width - (Manual.Size.Width)) / 2) - (Manual.Margin.Left * 2)
nevermind guys i just had to use a higher framework for it to work
Anchor to left and right during design time. 
Try that explanation again man. I am not understanding what you want to do.
If I'm understanding you correctly, it looks like you have the variables in the wrong spot. The If statement should say If PI &gt; 0 and PI &lt; 10 And LL &gt; 0 and LL &lt; 40 Then Category. Text = "A-4 or A-2-4" Similar format for the next size. 
This... If 0 &lt; PI &lt; 10 Then ...only works when PI is 1-9. You have no Else clause so End Sub.
I tried it, it's still not working. I made the margin 0 on all sides as well and got rid of any anchoring, but the behavior was exactly the same
You probably need to use "ClientSize" to get the inside of the window and not the entire width with borders included... Manual.Left = (Me.ClientSize.Width - Manual.Width) \ 2
This works! Thanks so much!!
huh, strange. The think the form has default margins too. Check those. I use Manual.margin.* because I assumed they'd be the form defaults. But if you change the Manual.margins then the form still has it's defaults. See how I did .left * 2? I assume the form and Manual margins would be the same. Try this: Manual.Left = ((MyBase.Size.Width - (Manual.Size.Width)) / 2) - (Manual.Margin.Left + MyBase.DefaultMargin.Left) 
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit: - [/r/msaccess] [Crosspost: looking for some answers regarding parameterized access queries.](https://np.reddit.com/r/MSAccess/comments/6xfn6o/crosspost_looking_for_some_answers_regarding/) [](#footer)*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))* [](#bot)
i'm confused if there might be another method or something for forcing that nullvalue back to the database. every where i look DBnull.value is the prescribed fix, but its failing gloriously in this situation
i've tried the following: 1. Setting a variable to nullable date and using that 2. Using Nothing 3. Using "" 4. using cmd.Parameters.Add("@Warehouse_Date",OleDbType.Varchar,40).Value=DBNull.Value 5. using "null" i'm just about out of things i can try
i think just about the only workaround i can do here is to update the values of all non dates- and then craft a second update string to handle the dates independently? 
I'm not too familiar with Access but with SQL the field needs set to allow null values when setting up the table. Maybe Access is similar and it isn't set up to allow null? Edit: just read your update but my thought is still the same. Does the field type match the variable type?
On the second control, can't you assign the context menu to that control? There is a drop down in the properties of the control that assigns a context menu.
Perhaps declare the context menu at public form level, and then have subsequent forms reference the context menu? Alternatively, generate the context menu purely through code (instead of using the designer) and bundle it into a public shared sub at form level, and then have the subsequent forms call that shared sub to construct their personal context menus.
As an example (air-coded, caveat bugtor): Public Class Form1 Public Shared Function BuildContextMenu() As ContextMenuStrip 'code to build menu here End Function End Class Public Class Form2 Public Sub Load() Dim cms as ContextMenuStrip = Form1.BuildContextMenu Me.Controls.Add(cms) End Sub End Class
i managed to work it all out. the DB was set up correctly, my issue stemmed from me not knowing that ACE/OLEDB dont support Named parameters. Even by naming it @XYZ and then assigning the variable to @XYZ in my parameter assignment, it would still assign the parameters in the order they were added to each parameter slot. Really freakin annoying. im used to working with flat out SQLclient but this project required access :/
There is, but the context menu has to be placed on the form for that dropdown to use it
I'm getting a bug that I can't seem to figure out: When I try to add a `ContextMenuStrip`, I get `Top-level control cannot be added to a control` as an error message. However, adding a `TextBox` works as expected. The relevant code is literally a single line: Public Class PointBot ... Private Sub ManualButton_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles ManualButton.Click If ... Then ... begin() ... End If End Sub Public Sub begin() Me.Controls.Add(New ContextMenuStrip) End Sub ... End Class I've tried putting the code in different functions with different scopes, but every time where adding a `ContextMenuStrip` doesn't work, adding a `TextBox` does. What do you think?
Hey, could you go into more detail? Is there something special that you want to create?
 Private Sub MoveToStart() Cursor.Position = PointToScreen(Panel1.Location) Cursor.Position.Offset(10,10) End Sub 
Hey, hope this is still relevant, was abroad and read your question just now. When you have the path of the folder you want, you can create an instance of the class DirectoryInfo Dim dirInfo as new DirectoryInfo(path) with *dirInfo* you can now do a few nice things like dirInfo.EnumerateFiles("*.png") this returns an object of the type *IEnumerable&lt;FileInfo&gt;*. Sounds scary but all thats saying is that its a List (Array, ArrayList, List&lt;T&gt;, etc) that you can enumerate (iterate) over, for example with a foreach loop. Dim dirInfo as new DirectoryInfo("C:\") For Each fileInfo As FileInfo In dirInfo.EnumerateFiles(".png") MsgBox(fileInfo.name) Next for example would get all *.png* files in *C:\* (!NOTE: only in *C:\*. A picture in *C:\MyFolder\* would not be found, that requires *.enumerateDirectorys* and recursion) when you have you *FileInfos* you can create the Image Objects like I described in my first answer, save them in a *List(of Image)* and then sort them. Here you can be creative(*List(of T)*, *Array* and *ArrayList* will be really usefull to you here) One more thing: The [FlowLayoutPanel](https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/f9e8s203%28v=vs.110%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396) is allso worth a look. Its not the concept you described in your picture but rather a horizontal scroll bar, but it takes the whole sorting of the Images out of your hands. Hope this helped 
 try txtBox2.Text = New System.Text.ASCIIEncoding().GetString(Convert.FromBase64String(txtBox1.Text)) catch ex as exception txtBox2.Text = "Failed to decode" end try 
First I would question why you want to add a ContextMenuStrip **problematically**. To answer your question though, a ContextMenuStrip doesn't get added to a forms controls collection like a textbox does. A ContextMenuStrip gets assigned to the ContextMenuStrip property of a given control like a form or a textbox. A given control can only have 1 contextmenu assigned to it at a time. Me.ContextMenuStrip = New ContextMenuStrip should not give you an error.
What type of file a text file binary file? The namespace you are looking for is System.IO The ReadAllBytes method would open up a file, and return it's contents in a byte array.. writeallbytes takes a byte array and writes it to a new file or overwrites an old file in its entirety. Here is a list of methods within that namespace https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.file_methods(v=vs.110).aspx As far as compiling it to a dll. If it is a dll compatible for the .net framework, it is fairly straight forward. You would create a class library project in visual studio. If you are looking to create com objects, that is something I can not help you with as it has been over 10 years since I've done that.. Though this is where I would start. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/programming-guide/com-interop/walkthrough-creating-com-objects 
It will be a binary file. I don't know VB so think the path of least resistance would be to compile the function into a dynamic link library and then [call for it in autoit.](https://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/docs/functions/DllCall.htm) Not sure how I would compile the function into a dll though. Downloaded the MS community VB compiler but didn't see a project to open that was for compiling a dll. Do I need to know what VB version this code is written in to compile it into a dll? What compiler do I need to do this? Will the code need to be modified to compile it into a dll? I appreciate the help, thank you.
If you care about the overhead of an exception, then you can validate the string before hand. This is taken from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21242217/1818637) - **NOT TESTED** Private Function IsBase64(input As String) As Boolean If (input = Nothing Or input.Length = 0 Or (input.Length Mod 4) &lt;&gt; 0 Or input.Contains(" ") Or input.Contains("\t") Or input.Contains("\r") Or input.Contains("\n")) Then Return False Else Return True End If End Function 
The basic design looks like this: Sub Main Dim fname = "c:\test_file.txt" Dim file = IO.File.ReadAllBytes(fname) ' read the file For i = 0 To file.Length - 1 file(i) = RevBits(file(i)) ' reverse each byte Next IO.File.WriteAllBytes(fname &amp; ".rev", file) ' save the file End Sub Function RevBits(b As Byte) As Byte Dim r As Byte = 0 r = r Or ((b And 1) &lt;&lt; 7) r = r Or ((b And 2) &lt;&lt; 5) r = r Or ((b And 4) &lt;&lt; 3) r = r Or ((b And 8) &lt;&lt; 1) r = r Or ((b And 16) &gt;&gt; 1) r = r Or ((b And 32) &gt;&gt; 3) r = r Or ((b And 64) &gt;&gt; 5) r = r Or ((b And 128) &gt;&gt; 7) Return r End Function If you want to create a DLL, you must use the "Class Library" project. You could probably also make a console application that takes the filename as its first argument and converts the file...
&gt; try &gt; txtBox2.Text = New System.Text.ASCIIEncoding().GetString(Convert.FromBase64String(txtBox1.Text)) &gt; catch ex as exception &gt; txtBox2.Text = "Failed to decode" &gt; end try Thanks It worked.!! You're awesome. 
I think you would instead just set the ContextMenuStrip property of the form to your contextmenustrip. So instead of me.controls.add(cms) you would use me.ContextMenuStrip = cms
that's correct. you can ask your instructor for a copy, but the likihood of getting one is quite variable.. but many things are similar enough to the latest community version, just you may not be able to work on your class projects directly.
&gt; Thank you very, very much! This works perfectly! 
Can you put them in a groupbox and run something like Dim checkcount as integer For Each ChkBox As CheckBox In GroupBox1.Controls If ChkBox.checked = True then Checkcount = Checkcount + 1 Next I'm a novice but trying to help so sorry if this idea doesn't work. 
you could add a custom handler to the checkevent in that handler you'd just increment the value by one myvar=myvar+1 its been a while since i did any coding but that's what i'd do *ready to get flamed / corrected* lol ;) 
Wow I'll try it thanks
Could you possibly give an example im a little confused? Thanks so much for the help 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/winforms/how-to-connect-multiple-events-to-a-single-event-handler-in-windows-forms ... you can do this in code too in the form load think the syntax is AddHandler someHandler someObject.Event ... put this in a for loop for all the controls on the form ... if the control = checkbox then assign the handler ... im a little sketchy at posting code to reddit ... let me figure out how to format it and ill write a proper reply 
save it as RTF and use the rich text control.
Needs to go in form.load ... For Each oCheckBox As CheckBox In me.controls() AddHandler myCustomHandler, Addressof oCheckBox.CheckChanged() next Needs to go some where else in the form class ... Dim myvar as integer = 0 Private Sub myCustomHandler(sender as Object, e as EventArgs) dim oCheckBox as CheckBox = sender if oCheckBox.Checked then myvar=myvar+1 End Sub This would increment the counter every time one of the check boxes was checked that's what you asked for hehe ... if you want a function to count checks and display them every time a check is changed i can probably help you with that too :) 
Wow thanks imma look up what all this means! 
Thannk you very much.
Make sure that the excel file is actually in the correct path... Also, maybe use a backslash instead of a forward slash for the path as it is a file path...
Thank you for your help, it worked but I'm still having some problems..[This](https://imgur.com/Kbc5QsM)is a screenshot of the table in the Excel File, and [This](https://imgur.com/lpd0q9I) is a screenshot of the table that I got in the DataGridView, notice that it didn't display the top headings("Masculin","Feminin","Ensemble") and when I change those cells to numerical values (1,2,3) it displays them just fine. Also it didn't display the cells that span over three columns correctly, do you have any idea as to why that happened ?
Is the ColumnHeadersVisible property set to true on the datagridview?
I would try building all the items into the second box and hide the items you don't want based on the selection of the first box. Or manually add the items through an if statement or select If cbox1 = laptop then Cbox2.additem ("dell") Etc. Dim box as string = cbox1.text Select case box Case "laptop" Cbox2.additem(dell) Case "desktop" Cbox2.additem (hp) Should work.
I want to make it so the second box hides all the items based on what i select in the first combobox as following I have lets say laptop and desktop The second combobox has all the names for both (but hides them adepending on what i choose in the first one) and then have a third one that has all the submodel names and based on these three selections upon pressing a button i want it to show me the specs of them. My project is not for computers but i need to know how to make them hide content i dont want cause i never did this before.
Okay. Possibly use something like this then. If cbox1 = "laptop" then cbox2.items(index).enabled = false EndIf Index being the index number for each item you want to hide. 
You will need to clear all the other comboboxes when the selection changes and then add your new items based on that selection. 
That's not something you can do. You can't just hide items in a combobox. You will have to clear the combobox and populate it with those entries you need.
That's what I started with above. I'm not at my computer to try my second suggestion but I thought it would work. I'm a self taught novice but I believe there are many ways to get his problem solved. Probably can even use datatables that hold the lists and set the datasource through if statements too.
So i get one combobox with a the desktop and laptop options and populate the second one with whatever i need but based on the first selection? And if so how can i do such thing (vb.net)
u/marcmiller2007 showed you how to change the items based on the first combobox. You'll need put that code in the SelectionChanged part of the combobox. I would Clear the combobox before adding in the Laptop/Desktop names. cboType.items.clear() Is this homework?
Nope, its a small project i want to do and since i know nothing i needed some info on this thanks so much if i need anything ill come back and ask
Yes it is.
Thanks, it worked! Could you please explain this line? For each chkbox as checkbox , thanks 
Chkbox is just a variable to use in the For loop so you are assigning it as a checkbox inside the group box control. So the loop is basically going to check each control to see if it is a checkbox. When it finds one, it's calls it chkbox and looks to see if the ".checked" property is true or false. If it's true, it increments your counter by 1. This works pretty simple inside a group box. 
Thanks, it worked! Could you please explain this line? For each chkbox as checkbox , thanks 
Thanks so much :)
What are you trying to do? We’re not computers or walking IDE’s. P.S. Get rid of that terrible grid, too confusing for the simple minded. Combo boxes are designed for this.
 Easiest way is to create 3 gbchild one for each row. 
Good idea. Thanks 
I agree. I haven't been able to figure out how to do this in one group box. I would make a separate group box for the front row and just calculate new variables for those and add them together at the end. 
Thanks :)
not sure if this is considered bad programming form but each CheckBox has a tag property. You could put an "x" in the tag property of the front row check boxes and then check for that tag with a simple if statement.
What type of control is the scroll bar attached to? 
Hi OP. i wanted to do something similar when adding items to a listbox. in the end i decided that it would be simpler for me to add the new listbox items to the top ofthe list instead of the bottom. the scroll bar took care of itself when i told it to focus the selected item on the top most item .. yes, thats backwards but it was what i needed.. its just a wild way i got creative and it worked for me. lol but in theory, you could just set the selected index to be the highest index number -1 and your selected item will be at the bottom.. automagically jumping to the latest index and the scrollbar goes with it. 
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.math.round(v=vs.110).aspx 
Thanks for your response! I am not really understanding how I am supposed to implement this into my code, though... (This is my second coding assignment ever.)
ytm = Math.Round( (intr + a) / b, 2) will round the result to two decimal places.
are you actually getting an error, or just the output isn't what you expect?
Vb does have some rounding issues that I haven't learned well yet. Like always rounding up or down to specific decimal places is unique I think. 
Thank you!
It is inside the bin folder of your project
They only need the framework that your app is targeting to run your exe on their computers. You should compile your code in release mode, and then get the exe file from the bin\release folder. If your application does anything more complicated, you may need to actually create a real installer for it.
But I've tried my app on a machine that doesn't have MSV installed and it didn't work.
There is no release folder inside the bin folder. There is only a folder named Debug.
You must install .net framework
That is because you need to flip the dropdown in Visual Studio from debug to release and then do a build and it will compile your exe into a release folder.
you could also publish it, it's an option and then you get an executable installer package.
Meh you get the shitty clickonce thing. Definitely not recommended to use.
How can I create a real installer for it ?
Instead of trying to automate Outlook, I would recommend going right to the email server for the information. Check out this library for accessing POP and IMAP servers. You should be able to query the server and get the information you are looking for. https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit#retrieving-messages-via-pop3 
I can't do that, as the clients are attaching pst's to their mailbox to search through. Thanks for the idea tho. 
I'd like to do this too, If I could see the unread inbox counts for all team members that would be very useful
This can be done easily using the [Microsoft Outlook Interop library](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.office.interop.outlook.aspx). Here is a snip it that will dump emails to the console window. ' Dumps all email in Outlook to console window. ' Prompts user with warning that an application is attempting to read Outlook data. Imports System.Collections.Generic Imports System.Linq Imports System.Text Imports Outlook = Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook Namespace OutlookEmail Class Program Private Shared Sub Main(args As String()) Dim app As New Outlook.Application() Dim outlookNs As Outlook.NameSpace = app.GetNamespace("MAPI") Dim emailFolder As Outlook.MAPIFolder = outlookNs.GetDefaultFolder(Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook.OlDefaultFolders.olFolderInbox) For Each item As Outlook.MailItem In emailFolder.Items Console.WriteLine(item.SenderEmailAddress + " " + item.Subject + vbLf + item.Body) Next Console.ReadKey() End Sub End Class End Namespace 
But as stated in OP above, this example specifically uses the inbox (Outlook.MAPIFolder = outlookNs.GetDefaultFolder(Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook.OlDefaultFolders.olFolderInbox) ). I don't want them to use the inbox specifically, I would like them to choose from a list of stores.
I have used: If (Not AssemblyMaterials) = -1 Then 'Stuff Else 'other stuff End If Hope that helps. Sorry if formatting is wrong. I'm on mobile.
Ha so there isn't just an is empty phrase I can use? Also they are considered - 1 is empty? 
That isn't even remotely valid code and makes zero sense.
Not at a computer to get perfect syntax, but why not just use the count method? If list.Count() = 0 Then... Edit: Didn't realize you mentioned using .Count() in OP. Since you're initializing it with a New List&lt;T&gt; in constructor, I'm not aware of any simpler ways to check this.
Could probably do If AssemblyMaterial.Items.Count &gt; 0 Then 'Do things, continue, etc Else Messagebox.Show("Yo' list is empty son!") ExitSub 'Or do other things. EndIf 
You're probably right. I was thinking of arrays when using VBA in Excel. Sorry about that.
Well personally I have a job.
I once made a program for my brother to keep track of all the players in his hockey pool at work. He paid me $50 when he won. Another time, I made a simple budgeting program for a lady friend of mine who was always running out of money at the end of the month. It basically did some very simple math for her after we added in all her income and expenses, and let her know how much money she actually has as disposable income. I made it as easy as a pocket calculator, and she loved it. That month she actually had a few dollars left over. She gave me $20. Sure, I'm not gonna retire off this stuff or anything, but it's something. Just look for opportunities.
I think OP is looking for alternative ways to make money. Like freelance type work. I'm also curious. I assume you're joking though. Haha.
Yeah, I'm mostly being a smartass. I can tell you, though, I would never hire the OP just based on his careless grammar. He comes across as lazy and sloppy, which is why I responded in a snarky way. Even if English isn't his first language, it's a really bad first impression.
That sounded pretentious as fuck. It's an anonymous internet post, not a CV.
I AM pretentious as fuck. It takes very little effort to be clear. Somebody who isn't willing to put in that effort (regardless of the forum) probably isn't willing to put in the effort anywhere else either. Lazy and sloppy here = lazy and sloppy elsewhere.
Making money with VB has become increasingly more difficult unless you can support old VB6 code bases. It is few and far between the jobs and contracts that are looking for VB.Net. I myself switched to Python about 7 years ago as my money earning language. I use VB everyday for myself and recently writing for Net Core 2 for clients who want to operate on Linux. I am hoping that Net Core 2 will start to bring back jobs.
I text in a stream-of-consciousness style with very little attention to grammar or punctuation. I also have a Master's degree in InfoSys and work in tech. My internet/texting habits are in no way a reflection of my professional ones. Come the fuck on.
Congratulations on that. If the only communication I receive from you is lazy and sloppy then I'm going to assume you're lazy and sloppy in general. I have no reason to assume otherwise. It takes very little effort to capitalize words and use punctuation when texting or posting on the Internet. If you don't, I am going to judge you for it. 
In a console application, no.
And that's pretty insufferable. But you seem to be proud of that. Whatever dude
See, that's called judging based on the available information. That's how it works. And yup I'm pretty insufferable when it comes to the degradation of written communication. I hate it when somebody is so lazy they have to abbreviate the word "you" or "see". The only justification is when you have a 140 character limit and you are forced to abbreviate. Otherwise, take that extra 10 seconds to type real words and review your post before clicking Submit.
what have you tried that isn't working?
you'd need to use some kind of console gui toolkit, which I dont' even know if that exists for vb.net. maybe some weirdo has ported ncurses 
 Console.Write("Press Enter to continue") Dim c As Char = Convert.ToChar(Console.Read()) ' new line is 2 characters: vbCr and vbLf If c = vbCr Then Console.Read() ' read vbLf (which must come after vbCr) Console.Write("You pressed Enter") End If Console.Read() ' just to prevent console from closing 
Thank you. Works like a charm.

It's not about being smart, it's about being considerate. If you make that slight extra effort to be readable, then hopefully people won't discount you. I'm not the guy bragging on reddit about my degrees and my job.
It's a definite value add for most corporate jobs. You can take over additional responsibilities and oversight. That said, you probably still need to fit into a good organization first and foremost. It might not necessarily get you in the door at a lot of places because a lot of employers still don't fully grasp the value it provides, but when you get to the interview you can impress the shit out of them by explaining the potential process efficiencies you could implement.

You could in theory create a text style toolbar at the bottom of a console application, but not a graphical one. For example you could have at the bottom at all times in the console application [E]xit - [S]ave - [O]pen - [F]ind and then if user hits some key like ctrl+E, it would exit the console app, etc..
Your code isn't VB so I don't know why you are posting it here.
I think what you are looking for inside the if statement would be this: "A" OR "a" same with the d if statement. The &amp; is used to combine strings so "A" &amp; "a" would become "Aa" which isn't something you would put in an if statement.
great advice! thanks for the comment 
ok good to know thanks
cool good to know thanks.
Read about selectedindexchanged event and try to come up with something. If stuck, post ur code here
you should look into Windows API programming. i don't get the minecraft reference but you can, for example, create a modal window with some transparency to display information. 
 Dim x As Integer x = numericUpDown.Value You mean like that? 
I already tried that, but that helps too because now I know the problem isn't there. Thanks!
Well what exactly is your problem?
U can do simulated terminal. Port the output from command line function to a textbox.
Is that the only thing wrong with it. Is there a more efficient way of coding it that I haven't learnt?
At this point it might work? I didn't look to closely at anything else. The biggest improvement I could see would be to properly incorporate functions and classes, and reduce or eliminate the module. 
Ah. When I replaced the &amp;s with Or I got this error message: Unhandled Exception: System.InvalidCastException: Conversion from string "a" to type 'Boolean' is not valid. ---&gt; System.FormatException: Input string was not in a correct format. at Microsoft.VisualBasic.CompilerServices.Conversions.ParseDouble(String Value, NumberFormatInfo NumberFormat) at Microsoft.VisualBasic.CompilerServices.Conversions.ToBoolean(String Value) --- End of inner exception stack trace --- at Microsoft.VisualBasic.CompilerServices.Conversions.ToBoolean(String Value) at Star_wars_Maths_Game.Module1.Main() in C:\Users\olive\OneDrive\Documents\Visual Studio 2017\Projects\Star wars Maths Game\Star wars Maths Game\Module1.vb:line 92 Image: https://i.gyazo.com/309760d333d756d74c15aadf7de2028e.png
You have to compare each on to the original, sorry I explained it poorly. It would actually looks like this with x being your input: If x = 'a' or x = 'A' then ... 
Thanks that seem to make it work but when you select one option it doesn't say "you picked up the item" like I think I asked it to do. it just goes on to the next option without considering what you choose. i think I did this wrong.
at line 79 and 80
After your first set of choices you need to reset your variables back to false, because your option is still set as true, thus messing up the second batch of choices
but before I reset the values don't I need the program to say If hasHelmet = True Then Console.WriteLine("You pick up the helmet and underneath is a key to your spaceship.") If hasLightsaber = True Then Console.WriteLine("You picked up the lightsaber.") Then I reset them right?
Yup!
But it doesn't work. Arrr.
How do I make it work?
I ended up debugging your code and on the first choices you used Console.Read() this sends back a number not a character. Use Console.Readline(). I also cleaned up some stuff for you here: https://pastebin.com/HFkJy3wy
On line 75 in the pastebin you want it to read userinput = Console.ReadLine() But if you don't want to ask around for every small problem you run into you probably should look into debugging(I guess check the sidebar for tutorials). Also I don't know how long you want to make this, but if you continue like that, anything a bit longer will be pain to write.
My first thought is that by encrypting the connection string you are removing portability of your data source. It was placed in the .config so that it could be changed easily. I would suggest that you store the connection information in a separate file that is encrypted. Load the file at the start of your application, decrypt, and create your connection object from that information. This gives you the flexibility to have multiple files that point to different data stores as well as keeping the information secret. 
You could create your own command window and redirect input and output to the window. This would allow you to add any controls you wanted to the form that would effect the cmd instances. http://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?381405-Automate-Command-Prompt-Window-(CMD)-Redirect-Output-to-Application-2003-2005 
Thank you very much for your help with this. It has been extremely valuable as a novice coder. I've learnt a lot. Thanks.
i'm using Twilio BTW
&gt; Console.Read() this only reads the next single character in the entered line. Try console.readline() to read in the entire entered line to compare that to your passcode.
nope that doesn't work. Hmmm
Do you know how to set a break point and step through the code line by line? You would know instantly why your entered value is not equaling the passcode variable value by setting a breakpoint on that line and looking at the comparison.
I don't, i'm sorry. This is my first coding project. Can you give me an example?
Sure, you just click in the grey column to the left of where your code is, and it will put a red dot and highlight the line of code where the dot is. Then when you run the code, when the IDE hits that specific line, it will stop processing code, and bring you into the IDE code so you can step through the code line by line as it is running, and mouse over variables to see their contents, among other things. [This tutorial](http://www.homeandlearn.co.uk/NET/nets5p6.html) might use a slightly older version of Visual Studio, but the concepts are all the same. Knowing how to properly debug and run through your running code line by line will make any coding project infinitely easier for you.
Okay thanks for that, really helpful. I still don't see how I could fix my code with this. Can you help me with that?
I suggest you experiment with console.read and console.readline in a separate project. 
Get rid of Line 127 and change Console.Read to Console.ReadLine in Line 128 and 134. I doubt you will need Console.Read anywhere in your Project so you better stick with Console.ReadLine. Now again... you best learn the basics of debugging. At least it should help you find out where exactly things go wrong and make it easier to look for solutions. Also it might help you understand the code you've just written. I guess the tutorial linked by /u/TheFotty is a start but maybe[ a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0vDKXIq_9A&amp;ab_channel=Michael) will be easier to understand.
Not seeing any code or what your UI looks like, I would probably do something as /u/curiositor suggested in the selectedindexchanged event. Possibly group and store the different texts by GPU, CPU, and RAM in arrays. Something like: Dim CPU(4) as string CPU(0) = "...spec1" CPU(1) = "...spec2" CPU(2) = "...spec3" ... (etc) Same for the GPU and RAM info. This way, you can do something like: Dim CPUboxvalue as string = CPUBox.SelectedItem Select Case CPUboxvalue Case "AMD" CPUtxtboxspec1.text = CPU(0) CPUtxtboxspec2.text = CPU(1) Case "Intel i5" CPUtxtboxspec1.text = CPU(4) ...(etc) You can do this for each grouping of information. If you want to show specific GPU/RAM information based on the CPU selected, you will have to do and IF or another Select Case and look at the CPU selected value and use that in that logic for determining what info to show. 
I will send you a messege with the ui and some of the code but that will be either on wednesday or friday
Do you know how to use the debugger? Place a break on the first For ... and step through the code. By doing that you'll be able to see how the for-next loops, and how the Lines variable is incremented. 
Agreed. The loop is fairly basic to understand, so run through it, and *see* what it does.
have a look at nested loops.
This is homework, figure it out with the debugger. I am not going to help you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJGdPa9X24 In your case, you're doing another loop inside each iteration of the loop. Except the max value is not set, but changes every "big" loop.
The newer control is DataGridView that gives you a spreadsheet view on your form, GridView for ASP. All/most date manipulation can be done through the DataSet control now. * Add as DataSet to your project. * Add TableAdapter to your DataSet for remote DB (Sql Server, Access) or add Table to your DataSet for your local table. Dim DS as New YourDataSet Dim TA as New YourTableAdapter TA.Fill(DS.YourTable) For Each oRow as DS.YourRow in DS.YourTable oRow.field = NewStuff Next DS..WriteXml ' is handy for local tables.
 Console.Write("Question: " &amp; firstMultiple &amp; " + " &amp; SecondMultiple &amp; " =") Alternatively, you can use an argument based syntax: Console.Write("Question: {1} + {2} =", firstMultiple, SecondMultiple)
Also, if you're on the newer versions of Visual Studio you can do console.write($"Question: {firstMultiple} + {secondMultiple} =")
what makes you think it doesn't work? what does "work" mean in this case?
im getting the error message: char values cannot be converted to 'Integer'. Use Microsoft.VisualBasic.AscW to interpret a character as a unicode value or Microsoft.VisualBasic.Val to interpret it as a digit. over (planet(2) and (planet(2) these two lines: If Console.ReadLine(planet(1)) Then If Console.ReadLine(planet(2)) Then 
you should probably read those into a temp String, validate it, then cast it into the array (assuming you actually mean to overwrite the array)
Personally, i prefer crafting sql statement manually. In the long run, especially for complex insert statement across multiple tables, it will be easier.
This is my first program. I haven't got a clue what you're going on about. Can you give me an example?
Something like this? Enter the **number of the planet**. Dim Currentplanet As String = "" Dim planet() As String = {"a", "b", "c", "d", "e"} Dim sLine As String = "" Sub Main() While 1 choosePlanet() End While End Sub Private Sub choosePlanet() Console.Clear() Console.WriteLine("Choose a planet: ") Console.Write(Currentplanet &amp; "- Current") Console.Write(planet(1)) Console.WriteLine(planet(2)) Console.WriteLine("") Console.Write("Planet: ") sLine = Console.ReadLine() Console.WriteLine("") If sLine.Length &gt; 0 And IsNumeric(sLine) AndAlso CInt(sLine) &lt;= planet.Length Then Currentplanet = planet(CInt(sLine) - 1) End If Console.WriteLine("You selected: " &amp; Currentplanet) End Sub 
Is that a homework? If yes, I would suggest you to revisit 1. Data Type 2. Boolean comparison 3. If control statement 
You're trying to use ReadLine() in a way that is not designed. Instead try something like defining a new string variable called ChosenPlanet. This will be used to store what the user types. ChosenPlanet = Console.ReadLine() Then your if statement might be something like: If ChosenPlanet = planet(1) OrElse ChosenPlanet = planet(2) then CurrentPlanet = ChosenPlanet else CurrentPlanet = "Invalid Planet Selected" End If This takes the input and stores it into the variable ChosenPlanet This example is based off of your current code and what I think you're trying to achieve. There are other ways to do this but I think this will be easier to follow as it is closer to your code. Note that this particular code is case-sensitive so Earth will not find earth and will result in Invalid Planet Selected as a result. See (.ToUpper or .ToLower) to control your inputs if this is an issue. If you look at [ReadLine() on MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.console.readline%28v=vs.110%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396), you can see that it's not expecting any arguments. 
the issue is in more in how you asked. you originally didn't share the whole program, and didn't say what it's supposed to do. from your attempt, it's not really clear what you want the result to actually be. your edit makes this look like it's an assignment, and the AscW/Val requirement makes it seem like this would not be the first program of the class. we're happy to help with assignments as long as you're upfront about it and post an attempt. we aren't going to do ti for you though. and you should be wary of any posts that seem like they are doing it for you. your instructor will be able to tell that someone with more experience wrote it. My suggestion is to take a step back and understand Console.ReadLine() first. the MS docs have good examples if your book doesn't. you need to get the input into a variables first, of String type, then work from there.
Look into the "Exit Do" statement.
Replace line 5 and 6 with: If intScore &gt;= 0 then intTotal += intScore intInputNUmber += 1 End If
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/using-breakpoints
Can you please just tell me what is wrong with it? Please.
825 lines you pasted and we have no idea what is going on. The time we need to understand which functions does what, you could easily learn about breakpoints (also for future problems) and solve the problem yourselves in the same time.
I know. I tried to locate it to around line 147. Sorry.
You never get to check if userinput is 'd' because you have 'End' before it. Also, this call, **Intro3()**, At line 106 is causing your message, "You're Engines are ready ..."
Okay. What would I put there then?
did you check out the link tweq posted? It's going to be a huge help. Set a breakpoint at line 127 and run the code, when the break point is reached, step through the code and follow what it's doing. Hover over variables and check to ensure that they hold the value you expect them to hold at the time of their execution. I would also suggest you look into Functions that would return a result back to the calling routine, for example your math routine could return true or false depending on if the answer was correct or not. From this, instead of bits of code like this: MathQuestion1() If questionOneComplete = True Then Console.WriteLine("Computer: Engines turning on") You could use: If MathQuestion1() = True Then Console.WriteLine("Computer: Engines Turning On") Else 'Put something here that tells the user something related 'to answering wrong and stop further execution into the game. End If This will help you later as you aren't setting a boolean somewhere that you might forget to reset. (ie, questionOneComplete). If however you need to check later on if qestionOneComplete was true, only then do you need to store that information. Doing this alone appears that it would reduce your code a lot and make it easier to follow. But again, follow the link and learn how to debug and use breakpoints or this is going to become a hair-pulling experience for you very quickly.
In addition, you should add some sort of error checking. If I enter "Bob smells funny" as the score, it's not going to go well. Take a look at IsNumeric()
Try using select instead. Private Sub Game() Intro() 'Console.WriteLine(Currentplanet) FirstChoice() ' Check the uppercase userinput Select Case UCase(userinput) Case Is = "A" 'do stuff for A Case Is = "D" 'do stuff for D Case Else ' handle all else. End Select . . . .
I am ending the code there because there is two options: to press A and to press D, if the user presses A it runs the top half of code. if the user presses D it runs the bottom half of code in the Sub Game().
'End' means end of program. Use a select instead 'If' to do work for 'A or 'D'
I tried using that but it seemed to miss out nearly all of the program and close after Intro(). This is my first program with Visual basic so i'm sorry if I am being stupid. I'm just kinda annoyed that I did this program without any major problems and when I'm nearly done I get fully stuck. :(
Can someone please just tell me what to correct?
That's not what we do here we help you find the answer. Many people are helping too.

if CInt(strInput) &gt;= 0 do stuff else exit sub
It looks like some people gave you some good choices, but uh... Did you take a picture of your monitor with your phone, then upload that picture to your computer? Why not do a screenshot? Print Screen + pasting into paint or with Windows, use Snipping Tool.
Why wouldn't you assume I uploaded it with my phone if I took it with my phone? 
Why would you upload with your phone when you have access to a computer and a screenshot would give a cleaner image?
Because it was more convenient to take a picture than log into my Reddit on the school computer during class and take a screenshot to post. 
I came here for help not to berated on how I uploaded my post. I know how to take a screenshot. 
What to correct is your attitude. Learn to debug, learn to comment your code (so we know what the intent is) and learn that coding is 90% fixing shit you broke - other people will not do these things for you.
I would guess that you're supposed to inject that into the game somehow. that's more of an swf question than a VB one.
you'd be better off doing this with css and making something look like a button rather than trying to embed the swf file in the button ... to control the file you need to use javascript ... its been soooo long since i did anything with flash (when it was still owned by macromedia) ... if you really want dynamic full featured 3d web games look at web GL its a version of open GL that runs in browsers ;) 
Three things: * 1. Post your code. * 2. Post your code. * 3. Never forget to post your code.
as /u/Abbotn has subtlety pointed out... how long is a piece of string? How can anybody help point out an error or help fix code if the code isn't visible?? Do you desire a long list "Possibly This" links? c'mon man. 
can i see the rest of the output message pls? 
Thanks this worked! I'm confused though because wouldn't this add one to the number of grades input and score? Edit: I see that it's checking for only numbers above zero to add to the counter. I have to change it to account for numbers above 100 though. Thanks for the help again
I'm relatively new to this sub but it really surprises me how often this happens. It's like asking someone to fix your vehicle without telling them what type of vehicle it is in the first place. Or people asking how to do something without posting code or even trying, let alone googling, for an answer. Just surprises me is all. 
 If intScore &gt;= 0 or intScore &lt; 101 Then
I'll help, I'll PM you, since I'd rather not put particulars out on the interwebs. 
PM me, if you want ask questions.
I can answer your questions too. PM me.
make a new blank project, replace the form code with that. add any UI controls (button picturebox, ??), then resolve any error from there
Thanks, I figured it out eventually!
PM me as well. I can also help.
I started with VB 2.0 back in 93, moved to C# about a decade ago, though still had to use VB up until a few years ago. Pm the questions and I'll get back to you tomorrow
Well I doubt that
Will it run on the .NET Framework? 😂
Lmfao. Good luck with that. 
Pm me as well
First Microsoft .Net Framework is always needed to execute .net programs. Second; Microsoft has released the setup deployment solution. You'll find it under Extensions &gt; Online. Or something like that. I was so angry when Microsoft removed this from VS2012. It's batshit crazy to install Windows Services - they aren't that easy to deploy as a winform or wpf. Fortunately since VS2013 the installer package is back as a plugin to VS. 
I take that you are from python. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.script.serialization.javascriptserializer(v=vs.110).aspx This library might be what you need. 
I'm from c++ actually. I have already deserialized the json but I cant save something to a string. The screenshot explains what i'm doing wrong http://prntscr.com/gop77o
Gotta have dreams right? I remember thinking the same thing when I started too. I wanted to write an ERP system for manufacturing companies. Then, I started learning SQL and database creation and started seeing reality. I started looking at our system database we use and got a big dose of reality. That it would take years and years to design and write my own ERP. Now I'm simply writing an order management program so we can see and get pertinent information much faster with exactly what we need to see.

Good luck with writing a bootloader lol
I say this all the time but it really helped me. Make things you want or need. For example when I took algebra I didn't want to buy an expensive ass calculator so I wrote some java that helped with the calculations. Not only did it save me money but it helped me understand how all the formulas worked easier than the text book. Also I know it may not have helped me understand how to complete a full project but when I had a random idea like I'd start working on it. I would work through the idea and if I just so happened to come up with a different *better* idea I would just start the new one. This let me come up with ideas that I was excited about at first but didn't force me to finish it if I got bored. I learn something new anytime I start to write code so it was still beneficial to me. I feel like if I would have forced myself to finish everything I started I'd get frustrated and not want to program. 
I wrote a program a couple years ago that generated random dinner ideas for the week and populated the ingredients we needed for them. I got sick of my wife asking me what I wanted for the week so I took a list of all our usual dinner options and would click a button to give a pop-up with Monday through Friday. 
Thanks I might try that. Good idea
Make a project that shows you the [periodic table of the elements](https://sciencenotes.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Periodic-Table-Color.png), and when you click on it, it takes you to the appropriate [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen) for that element. 
**Hydrogen** Hydrogen is a chemical element with symbol H and atomic number 1. With a standard atomic weight of circa 1.008, hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table. Its monatomic form (H) is the most abundant chemical substance in the Universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass. Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/visualbasic/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27

I also wrote a small program for my dad to quickly convert wattage, volts, amps and all that. 
I had fun replicating the original Super Mario Bros game in C# when I was bored. 
Thanks for all your comments! This post was made by my 9 yers old son. I know nothing about vb, but he is very ambitious about coding! 
I learned by making character creator programs for RPGs like dungeons and dragons.
You could build a voice attack Web scraping plug in 
If this is true, this is awesome. 
Did u use unity?
Nope, pure C#. It was just for fun, not practicality. 
A simple XML based CMS.
After the "players", it is an array. Not a dict
Cropping software adds extra steps.
The original isn't cropped, also Alt-Print Screen would just capture the active window so no extra cropping needed. If we're going for efficiency then phone was easiest in this case, but in terms of clarity it's not the best.
The code is trivial enough that you just need to read it to provide a decent answer. I had no issue reading it on my phone. For example, the correct loop is this: do intScore = CInt(InputBox("Enter Score")) if intScore = 0 then Exit Do intTotal += intScore intInputNumber++ loop 
Try...catch is for error handling so you can handle certain type of errors that you are expecting to happen, rather than having the application crash.
But the math formula is written after the Try, correct? And I do know to declare variables at the very start I believe. 
Yes. That would make sense.
What is MyVB? You used it in the title and the text. Are you saying "my VB question and my VB teacher" or "MyVB"?
Lol whoops I'm saying it wrong. We use a thing called MyProgrammingLab and I combined the names and didn't realize haha. I mean Visual Basic.
Gotcha. A Try/Catch/Finally block is just a structure of code that allows you to create exception handling. Errors in .NET (among other languages/runtimes) are called exceptions, so that is how I will refer to them, but it just means error. The Try block contains the code you are going to TRY to execute. It is the main code you are trying to run to accomplish whatever task the piece code is supposed to carry out. The catch block contains the code that should run only if an exception is thrown by the code in the try block, for example trying to convert a non numeric string like "abc" into a number. Dim x as integer = convert.tointeger("abc") Will throw an exception because "abc" is not a number. Dim x as integer = convert.tointeger("123") will work though, because it can convert a string of "123" to an integer of 123 without an error occuring. The Finally block is where you put code that you want to run no matter what. Meaning if code in the Try block runs and doesn't throw any exceptions, the catch block will never be called and the code in it will no run, but the code in the finally clause will run. The same if an exception is hit and the catch block of code is run, finally will still run. the Finally part of a try/catch/finally is generally used to clean up objects and free up any possible used resources (like closing an open handle to a file on the system, or closing out a database connection, etc..)
Thank you so much. That is way, way clearer. Finally was never even mentioned so this is a big help. Thanks again.
Are you embedding the the interop assembly? i read somewhere that it might need turning off so as to use those in GAC (for version compatibility?). 
Yes. Embed Interop Types is set to True in the properties for Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook. I tried setting it to False, but the published exe still crashed as soon as it tried to send the e-mail. 
Looks like I got it figured out. I looked in the project properties and, for some reason, the ClickOnce setting was for "partially trusted". I changed it to fully trusted and it seems to work now.
Did you clear out (or cut and paste elsewhere out as a backup) the debug folder? and then do a complete rebuild in the build menu? finally did you re-reference the interop? ie clear it, close project and VS, and then reopen the project and re-add the reference?
I am certainly no expert in VBSCRIPT. However, I agree with you that it seems you would need a file path to create the FSO object. I mean, you are literally trying to create an object to reference the file system... I also thought about some form of a stream before I got to you mentioning it. I would assume this would be some form of IO stream on the network. You would have to do some research on how to implement that. I would think it was very similar to FSO. But that would imply that the file is being uploaded to your server. Your post says you want to do this verification BEFORE it is uploaded to the server. That would require some form of client-side scripting for verification before the client uploads the file. I do not see how you could accomplish this on the server side. I am interested to see what others say. Perhaps they can prove me wrong. Love learning new things! 
I know right. The thing is, I did have an option to apply asynchronous js on it, but I was told to go down this path first as it is the option that changes the least amount of things in my code. Plus, I'm not really versed in jquery and ajax and the amount of time to learn it vs how minor this old system is may not be worth it. I just wanna see if it's really possible here.
I look forward to seeing what our fellow Redditors can come up with! =D
Conceptually, the server obviously can't read the contents of an upload *before* it has been uploaded to the server. However, you can receive and process the upload in-memory before you write it to the disk. This wouldn't involve file IO of course, but some other method of decoding bytes to strings. I know virtually nothing about classic ASP, but a quick search indicates that it doesn't actually have built-in file upload/HTTP multipart support, so I suppose the answer depends on whatever code/library you're using to handle this. I don't know what exactly you're working on and what the purpose of this validation is, but validation should never be (exclusively) performed on the client-side.
I don't know all the differences but I know 2017 allows me to create ribbons for the newer versions of Excel. Also, I think there's new threading statements,...Await. I guess if you're being tested with 2015 then you should stay with 2015 for now. Good luck.
But there's no difference in the syntax of Visual basic? Like the difference between python 2 and 3 ? I'm completely new to VB. 
Right, the syntax is the same.
...python is a cancer.
They added a couple of new things in 2017 that you won't need unless someone else is using the new features in C#.
Even for VB 2010?
The core language and syntax hasn't changed much since 2005, and has few, if any, changes between 2015 and 2017. Each new version adds support for newer versions of .NET, new language features, and UI updates to VS itself, but any code written in 2015 will run just fine in 2017. 
The last serious change of the core syntax was between the 1.0/1.1 and 2.0 versions of .NET (VS 2003 to 2005). New language features are added with each new version of the .NET Framework, and newer versions of Visual Studio can take advantage of them, but breaking changes are super rare with mature MS languages (VS 2017 is supporting VB 15). Starting with VS 2010 (IIRC) you can even select the version of .NET that you want to target in the application, and use a newer version of Visual Studio to write code for an older version of .NET.
I'm going to go with yes, the syntax hasn't changed. The biggest difference between 10 and 13 was the IDE, the developer environment, not the language.
Meh depending upon what you are using it for it is okay. For instance, scientists use it for data analysis. F# is *sort of* .NET's answer to it, but it is also very new.
The difference between VB program coded in VS 2015 vs 2017 would have nothing to do with the code but the extra stuff that 2017 might have introduced. So IMO stick with 2015, avoid confusion and headaces. Did VS 2017 add something that would mess up when ran in 2015? I doubt but it would easier to stay with 2015 besides it'll be a few years before anybody is moving to 2017. So it would be to your benefit to stay with 2015 as well 
VB team puts out a blog post with new releases to highlight specific differences for the language with that release. https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vbteam/2017/03/30/whats-new-in-visual-basic-2017/
No one here is just going to do the assignment for you. Any assignment you get in school should be based on things you learned in the class or were assigned to read about. If you were to post code that you needed help with, then generally people on this sub are pretty good about helping point out the errors and flaws in your code. If you just want someone to do your homework for you, you might be waiting a while.
Then drop the course. 18 hours is too much then don't take 18 hours. Simple. 
Sooo, what part of this have you worked on so far?
I'm good, thanks
You need to learn how to use one number as the index to an array. You need to learn how to use Mod operator to get the modulus (or remainder) of a division. You need to learn how to create that Ones function you started. If you can get the Ones function working, you will realize that your future Teens function and your Tens function are practically copies of each other. In fact, you might even realize that you can refactor the three functions down to a single function which has one of the arrays as a parameter. Oh, speaking of parameters, you are currently passing the string representation of both digits to the Ones function. You really need to be passing an integer instead. Here is a place where you would use a text to number conversion function. The old Basic function used to be called Val(), but .net has some better functions. Just for fun, you could roll your own function which reads a single character and uses a case statement to figure out what digit it represents. Oh, and you will need another array for "twenty", "thirty", . . . and learn the '&amp;' operator as a way to concatenate strings (don't forget to add a space)
Hard to know without a lot more info, but my first *thought* is that i wouldnt be surprised if windows defender/firewall is getting involved. if you open task manager is msmpeng.exe or msascui.exe busy? 
There are some differences in the language since VB2010... None of my recent projects will compile as-is if I open them in VB2010. Most of them won't even open, saying "&lt;project name&gt; (incompatible). Most breakage is from string interpolation: Dim s = $"The value of var1 is {var1} and var2 is {var2}" Other errors are from use of the recent ValueTuples added to C# and VB: Function ValueTupleExample() As (name As String, age As Integer) Return ("Bob", 43) End Function ...which are useful when you need to return a few values from a function and you don't want to code up a struct or class, or use ByRef to pass in variables declared at the calling site. Except for ValueTuples, most changes are "syntactic sugar" and simply help you type less code (or more readable code, like for string interpolation). The difference is much smaller with 2015 and 2017... Note that you can install many version of VS (I have 2008 (slowest IDE ever?), 2010, 2012, 2015 and 2017 all installed here...) but if you have to use 2015 in school, I'd go for that at home too.
Possibly to port those file to a proper database and use sql?
I’ve kinda gotta use fileget as part of criteria. It’s a college project 
Posting your code may help
I’ll do when I get home 
What are you loading into the browser control? Static HTML pages or are you actually navigating to URLs on the web? Even if you run this on say a machine that has IE11 on it, the browser control will render as if it was IE7 which could be part of your problem. You need to add registry keys in order to make the browser control render as if it were IE11.
&gt;earn several hours in tutoring pay to actually code the rest of the assignment in visual studio That's not what tutoring means.
Yep, going backwards you'll have to give up newer features and change the code back, but any code written in 2008 should open, and run, in 2017 without issue. 
Think about what happens after your first "if" if B is larger than A and C?
Look into nested ifs. If a &gt; b then If a &gt; c then largest = a End if End If This is basically the same as If a &gt; b And a &gt; c Then largest = a From here, you can figure out logic to figure out whether c is larger than a and b. Good luck. 
Neither were. And on my home computer I have Windows defender disabled and replaced with Avast. But now I relaunched the application on both machines and its CPU usage is normal, and I can't get it to go back up.
 if a &gt; b then largest = a else largest = b if c &gt; largest largest = c
That what's wrong with the code. If B is larger than A and C it outputs the value of C instead of B. I can't understand why, can you please explain it to me? Is it because of the End if below "Largest = b" ?
This problem could be approached sequentially. The first step would involve casting the `txtNum.Text` into an Integer (e.g. Using `Integer.TryParse()` or similar) and storing that in a variable. Then, find the number of tens and the number of ones of the number (using Mod and the Integer Division operator or equivalent) and store that also. From there, you would need then index the `ones`, `tens` and `wholetens`(for twenty, thirty, etc.) arrays to get the components that are wanted and concatenate it together (best done in a function so that you can make use of early returns). To ensure that you don't get something like twenty-zero and to support the special cases of `11-19`, you would need to add in some `if` statements. I'll use the number 27 as an example: 27 has 2 tens and 7 ones. For simplicities sake, let's assume that the first item of the `wholetens` array is empty. First, access `wholetens(2)`, to get `"twenty"`, then access `ones(7)` to get `"seven"` and concatenate the two strings using `&amp;` to get `"twenty-seven"`. Please note that `2` and `7` should be substituted with the names of variables which are set in the ones/tens step. 
In your first "if", you determine the largest number between A and B. In the second "if", you need to check "C" against "largest", and not against "A". At this point the "largest" variable has the value of whichever is largest between A and B, so you need to check *that* value against "C". Another way to do it, would be to check each value one by one. It's not as "elegant" as doing just two comparison, but it's much clearer and easier to understand: '...get A, B, and C like you're already doing... largest = A ' assume A is the largest for now... if B &gt; largest then largest = B if C &gt; largest then largest = C 
This is a clean way to do it without looping! Only 2 operations versus many
The input `40BCC4A4` is only 8 nibbles/4 bytes i.e. single precision. There are no more decimal places in the input. You can convert it from single to double precision afterwards, but while this may happen to be expressed with as a longer fraction when converted to decimal, it's not actually more accurate to the single precision input.
If that is the case then how is this example able to produce more decimal places? http://babbage.cs.qc.cuny.edu/IEEE-754.old/32bit.html My single representation appears to be a rounded version of what that page displays. Edit! Actually just converting the single to a double worked. I'm getting the expected result, Thanks!
Look at the details it shows, both single and double precision consist of the same exponent (2) and the significands 32 bit: 1.01111001100010010100100 64 bit: 1.0111100110001001010010000000000000000000000000000000 The only digits it actually adds are meaningless zeroes at the end of the binary fraction. The fact that the decimal representation of the double is longer is just due to the imprecise nature of binary floating point/decimal number conversions, it's not actually "more true" than the single precision result. You can get the same result as that website in VB.NET by using `Convert.ToDouble(BitConverter.ToSingle(bArray, 0))`, but obviously converting from single to double precision *afterwards* does not magically create precision that didn't previously exist in the input data. It's different, but not better.

&gt; Edit! Actually just converting the single to a double worked. I'm getting the expected result, Thanks! This doesn't actually help, and may even *reduce* the precision you're getting. Consider this for example: Dim singlePrecision = 1.0F / 10.0F Dim doublePrecision = Convert.ToDouble(singlePrecision) Debug.Print("Single: {0:G17}", singlePrecision) ' 0.100000001 Debug.Print("Double: {0:G17}", doublePrecision) ' 0.10000000149011612 Neither result perfect represents the decimal value `0.1`, but even though the double value has more decimal digits and may *look* more precise, it's even farther off than the single one.
I understand, the customer supplied the sample Hex value of 40BCC4A4 and stated the expected result should be 5.899003982543945, so I am able to deliver what they expect. Thanks again for your help.
[really?](https://www.google.com/search?q=vb.net+2017+tutorial) but the basics have't changed much since 2010, those tuts will mostly work just fine.
I bought this and have done pretty well. Beginning Visual Basic 2015 https://www.amazon.com/dp/1119092116/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apap_2H4QxGftOM7Rp I code every day and use the internet as a resource and not a place to just find the code I'm looking for. That I feel is an important distinction. In 4 months I have learned enough to code a program my company uses all day as an order management data center. 
Alternate method Dim max As Integer = a Dim name As String = "A" If b &gt; max Then max = b name = "B" End If If c &gt; max Then max = c name = "C" End If If d &gt; max Then max = d name = "D" End If MsgBox(name &amp; " is greater") Best Method Imports System.Linq Imports System.Collections.Generic Dim longs As New List(Of Long)(New Long(){4294967296L, 466855135L, 81125L}) Dim max As Long = longs.Max() MsgBox("The largest number is " &amp; max)
There are several good ones on the sidebar. And as already pointed out, the basics haven't changed much in quite a while. 
IMO [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLYePcodoNA&amp;list=PLqJXDdbv9bT-Eao-2ibYrZyPt_Qj6lf5b) is the best one on youtube, because he starts from the begining (with simple console programs) and not with dragging controls to graphical form editor. 
These are great, thanks.
I used [this](https://www.amazon.com/Visual-Basic-Hours-Teach-Yourself/dp/0672337452) book written by James Foxall. It is really well written and covers a wide range of topics. 
Use the correct query online. Pick up a book, learn the proper terms. It'll cut down on research time and help you parse through code solutions that aren't exactly what you're looking for. Also, design a project. Consider what you want it (your code) to do and start there.
For what? A string, textbox, datagram, etc. Gotta give us a little more than just a question. However, you're looking for: .ForeColor = Color.whatever Labels, textboxes, most things have this setting. 
Agree with the other guy, we need more info. If this is in a userform then you just change the text in the properties, cell text color can be changed with cells(#,#).text.color = RGB(#,#,#)
You probably want a Select Case statement. Set a variable for the green amount in each case, and then myColor = Color.FromARGB(255, 0, greenAmount, 0)
would that work in anything other than a rich text box?
Took a screenshot. https://gyazo.com/c38923cb22ce5bb3e50887c4d50309b9
Well I think there are a couple ways to do this. Since you are showing this all as one string, which regardless of size, is still just one variable so changing the ForeColor would change the entire string. What you would want to do is list each string that needs changed, set it's ForeColor to what you need, and place it in the string like this: "Air Pollution {string}" Or like: "Air Pollution "&amp; string &amp;" Very Low. Or probably put them in a string array and set them all at once like this: Dim VeryLow(4) as string VeryLow (0) = "Air Pollution" VeryLow (1) = "Whatever else" Etc.... VeryLow.ForeColor = color.whatever Do this for each set of ratings and put them in the string like I did above. I'm not at my computer so I don't know if this is the exact way to set the ForeColor but this should at least get you thinking in the right direction. 
I bloody thought it might be an array, wasn't quite sure though haha. Thank you, will try and get back to you.
'ForeColor' is not a member of 'String()'
After looking a little more, this won't be so easy. Have a look here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.drawing.color.fromname(v=vs.110).aspx?cs-save-lang=1&amp;cs-lang=vb#code-snippet-1 I am a novice around here but love to try to help people because it is going to help me as well. 
I am pretty confused by the code. Would I just change the 'FormName' to 'Low' and so on? https://gyazo.com/9317660814528df7debb08a289c3a12a
At school i'll try to get a copy of a tutorial my teacher made. I found it really helpful. Will try though.
How are you displaying the text? Richtextbox, pop-up dialog box, etc? 
what do you mean? This? https://gyazo.com/25793e26ae1e917a5055de6f4cb5cf44
Where do you ever actually call the loadpricearray_alt subroutine?
Use the sender or event arguments (depending on what event you are actually handling) to determine what button was pressed and take appropriate action.
like this? Private Sub dataGridView1_CellClick(ByVal sender As Object, _ ByVal e As DataGridViewCellEventArgs) _ Handles dataGridView1.CellClick
Well the event that you should be concerned with when clicking a button in a cell is the CellContentClick event, not the CellClick event. Lets assume you named the column with the first button in it firstButtonColumn and the second column with a button in it you named secondButtonColumn. In the single event handler, you can determine which button was clicked, but checking which column the click occurred in. If DataGridView1.Columns(e.ColumnIndex) Is firstButtonColumn Then 'do what should be done when first button is clicked ElseIf DataGridView1.Columns(e.ColumnIndex) Is secondButtonColumn Then 'do what should be done when second button is clicked End If
THANK YOU! will check if this works when i get home. Edit: by the way how do you post code format? (sorry, first timer here)
You just need to make sure each line is at least 4 spaces in from the left and made sure that you have a full line break between any regular text and your code Dim x as integer = 1 so you can type more regular text again, and then more code so long as you do 2 line breaks and indent the 4 spaces Dim s as string = "Reddit"
what context is this code? if it's server side, you may have a timing issue.
the context is an automated shopping bot for www.supremenewyork.com I think it may be a server side issue as some instances it works and some it doesn't do you suggest just adding a few sleeps after these faulty sections?
no, the programming context. scope. code location. framework. etc.
oh sorry my bad I am a novice programmer. As for the framework I am running visual studio 2017 and the latest version of vb.net. My program is built from a windows application form. By scope after a quick google are you after all my constants variables etc? as for the code location are you referring to on my hard drive or something else. Sorry for the apparently silly questions but I am a very new programmer. Many thanks 
so it's not asp.net? you're using an IE control? it's likely that your click action is not completing before the redirect starts, which then aborts the click.
I declared it and loaded it at the top, am I supposed to call it again?
If you define a subroutine, the code in it doesn't actually run unless you call the subroutine somewhere. In the code you posted, you declared the subroutine and put code in it, but i don't see anywhere that you actually called that sub to let its code run and initialize those prices in the array.
Thanks a lot! I just don't know how to properly call the sub now. I added a call into the original load and updated computeit function to: Sub computeit(ByRef titleA As String, ByRef message As String) Call loadpricearray_alt(prices) For i = 0 To 2 If prices(i, 0) = "A" Then message = titleA * prices(i, 1) End If Next End Sub If I run this now with a valid input in textbox1 then I get stuck on a msgbox I can't close out of. My goal output is to have label5 display the value in textbox1 * 57.5 (derived from the array)
I can gif what happens for you. It says the item is in the basket but unlike a manual click the item isn't actually present 
https://gyazo.com/dd86a1775dfd96529cad118871b517d5 https://gyazo.com/2866817da0eba58137719a8fc5147652 https://gyazo.com/098f3a1d6b610796734c26a04d32107c I think using a sleep after the add to basket and before redirecting should fix this. The only code I have found is System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(1000) This only seems to pause the whole button cart checkout sub at the start instead of pausing relative to the order I placed it in the code.
 Sub computeit(ByRef titleA As String, ByRef message As String) For i = 0 To 2 If prices(i, 0) = "A" Then message = titleA * prices(i, 1) End If Next TitleA is a string but then you use it to multiply. I suspect that converting it to a decimal and then multiplying will solve that part of the issue. Since message is a string as well you should convert the entire value back to a string.
everything works. Thank you very much!
everything works. Thank you very much!
another thought, sometimes the click isn't exactly bound to the element you think it is, especially with jquery. you might need to inject some javascript into the page DOM that call it using whatever framework the page uses.
what does "display the number of integers from 14 to 23" mean? one ata time? all at once separated by something? for the first, it's doing that, but so far you can't see it. for the 2nd, you need to string concatenation.
I figured this out using ControlChars.NewLine but I can't figure out how to add the integers and display them. 
Okay I will look into this thank you for your help 
Use lblOne.Text &amp;= intCount.toString instead. = replaces the text, &amp;= concatenates (adds onto). 
So I think it's helpful to actually explain what's going on here - your FOR loop is cycling from 14 up to 23 then finishing once it reaches 23. For each of the numbers in that group (starting from 14), the text label value is being set to that number. So when it first runs, intCount is 14, so the code that runs is lblOne.Text = 14. On the next loop, intCount is now 15. The code now does lblOne.Text = 15. On the next loop, intCount is now 16. The code now does lblOne.Text = 16. What you're seeing is that the execution is so fast that you don't see it changing each loop, all you are seeing is the final execution of the code, which happens to be lblOne.Text = 23. If you could slow down your code, you'd see the text label showing each number between 14 and 23. I'm gathering from your post that you want to show 14 + 15 + 16 + ... + 23 in the label, so you would need to do this. Dim total As Integer = 0 For intCount As Integer = 14 to 23 total = total + intCount Next lblOne.Text = intCount.ToString ...give that a go - if that's not exactly what you want, you may want to explain in a little more detail what you expect to see.
The reason why the validation needs to be done this way is because ultimately its just a temporary thing because the old system is in migration to a new java-based one that does the job. So the client simply wants the validation replicated here. It's makeshift and clunky and breaks so many rules in coding, but its not like it's going to survive in the next 5 years. Anyway, I'm not proud of the solution. What I ultimately did was take [this](https://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=8525&amp;lngWId=4) and used it to parse the uploaded text file to unicode *before* it gets saved to file. That's where I inserted the validation.
I ultimately used [this](https://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=8525&amp;lngWId=4) to just take the text file and parse it to unicode to be able to validate it as an entire string. It's so makeshift, but I'm not exactly coding with the next guy in mind if this system is gonna be trash in the next 5 years.
And we're supposed to understand your problem without looking at the code right? lol
oops sorry wasn't thinking when i posted 
safely? you don't. use a database. you can then use excel's SQL integration to pull data in as needed, or just add reporting and exporting features to your app. for shared-file-on-a-mapped-drive sqlite is easy and fairly durable, and access is easier but slightly less durable and may require a higher version of office. use MS's SQL Express if you want a proper fully robust database and have a server you can run it on. 
Let me preface by saying I 100% agree with your conclusion. However... &gt;safely? you don't. Could always create a service to sync the read/writes and prevent concurrency issues, and have each of the three clients communicate with the service, and not the excel file directly. It's not impossible to do safely, but I strongly suspect it is outside the scope of what OP wants/is capable of doing. I also strongly recommend a SQL Express instance, and adding rows via code. As you said, can always pull the data via SQL in Excel itself.
sure, you could also make a peer to peer protocol that dynamically assigns a master, or handles lock passing, but that's not "get the submit button to append all the collected data", exactly. sqlite and access have that multiuser lock handling build into the libraries already, and no need for a server, but they are less robust. they are robust enough for most use cases though
Think of it in terms of 1D motion only to start. What do you need for this? You need an X position on the map, and an X position on the screen. You also need to number of map tiles shown on the screen at any given time. The x position on the screen is dependent on the map position. When you get to the edge of the map, the player should stop being centered and start walking toward the edge. So, say your map goes from 0 to 1000. And player is at 500 x. And the number of tiles shown on the screen is 21. Ten to the left and ten to the right. Plus the tile the player is on. So, to start, the player is at the center of the screen. And the map is drawn from playerMapPos - (screenDrawWidth / 2) or 490. The drawing goes from 490 to 490 + screenDrawWidth, or 510. But what you really want is the playerDrawPosition, relative to that. And that changes as you get lower then 10 tiles. So you basically need two drawing functions. One for the default, centered character, if his position is greater than (screenDrawWidth / 2) or less than (MapWidth - (screenDrawWidth / 2)), and another drawing function if the player position is &lt; (screenDrawWidth / 2) or &gt; (mapWidth - (screenDrawWidth / 2)). I'm sorry if this seems complicated. But if it was simple, you probably would have figured it out on your own by now. So, if playerMapPosition &gt;= (screenDrawWidth / 2) Or playerMapPosition &lt;= (MapWidth - (screenDrawWidth / 2)) then player is centered on screen. Easy. You've already got this part done. But, if playerMapPosition &lt; (screenDrawWidth / 2) Or playerMapPosition &gt; (MapWidth - (screenDrawWidth / 2)) then you have to adjust the drawing position accordingly. In fact, you need two separate functions for this, one for heading left, and the other for heading right. PlayerDrawPosition basically becomes the playerMapPosition when heading left. When heading right, it becomes (ScreenWidth / 2) + (Mapwidth - PlayerMapPosition). You've also got to stop scrolling the map beneath the player, and start moving the player instead. This is done with a check to see if the player has reached the edge, and starting the offset of the map drawing accordingly. If playerMapPosX - (screenDrawWidth / 2) &lt; 0 then don't scroll. if playerMapPosX + (screenDrawWidth / 2) &gt; MapWidth, then don't scroll. Do the same for Y movement, and you've got a 2D game. Once again, sorry if it seems complicated. You may have to read it over a few times and think through the math in your head (or on paper). Sure hope this helps. Took me 45 minutes to write, and I'll probably only get a single upvote. :-p

Yeah, I'm learning while doing this so although I'm sure I could eventually pick up SQL with abit of additional learning I don't want to bog myself down if that makes sense.

honestly, interfacing with excel is not really that much easier. there's a lot of things SQL does for you that you'd have to code yourself to use excel.
Thanks for the help I'll give it a shot
the target is always on the left. you're overwriting the text box value.
Ahhh, thanks!
in that example, are the quotes included? you need full CSV parsing, which is non-trivial to do manually. Or maybe try using regex, but MS's regex isn't quite as powerful as PCRE
Are there any spaces around it, or any other way to differentiate the D| from anything else? 
Assuming that every word is also pipe delimited...and it is very hacky but what about looking for "|D|" and replacing it with "|" &amp; vbCrLf And then delimit on crlf. I mean there is no line feed or other special characters that aren't normally visible like if you were to open it up in notepad++ and show all characters? 
is there a chance you could post a few lines of the source material?
you're only displaying a message and not preventing the button click code running. put the validation in the button click with an "exit sub", and in the text change just turn the field red or something, no msgbox. a popup during a typing action is a really bad UI practice, and invariably results in the dialog being dismissed in ways the users did not want.
Thanks for your help I will try this soon!
Agreed. Validation and error handling should occur on commit, not input. Else numbnuts like me would spend all day in a typo&gt; Error&gt; undo &gt;Error cycle
So i put all of the information to the exit sub and know it does not do anything. I think that I am confused about what you meant. This is my first ever programming assignment for VB so sorry about the confusion. This is what it looks like now. Public Class frmCalculateGrade Private Sub btnCalculate_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnCalculate.Click Dim numberGrade As Decimal = CDec(txtNumberGrade.Text) Dim letterGrade As String = "" If numberGrade &gt;= 88 Then letterGrade = "A" ElseIf numberGrade &gt;= 80 AndAlso numberGrade &lt;= 87 Then letterGrade = "B" ElseIf numberGrade &gt;= 68 AndAlso numberGrade &lt;= 79 Then letterGrade = "C" ElseIf numberGrade &gt;= 60 AndAlso numberGrade &lt;= 67 Then letterGrade = "D" Else letterGrade = "F" End If txtLetterGrade.Text = letterGrade txtNumberGrade.Select() End Sub Private Sub btnExit_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnExit.Click Dim numberGrade As String = CStr(txtNumberGrade.Text) If numberGrade = "" Then MsgBox("This cannot be left blank!", MsgBoxStyle.Critical) ElseIf Not IsNumeric(numberGrade) Then MsgBox("This has to be numeric!", MsgBoxStyle.Critical) End If Me.Close() End Sub End Class 
lol why'd you put it in the exit click and not the calc click? need some sleep? :)
I could probably use some sleep lol. But when I try and do that it does not work either. It says that I have already used the variable before and if I change the variable it still does not work right either. This is what it looks like now. Public Class frmCalculateGrade Private Sub btnCalculate_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnCalculate.Click Dim numberGrade As Decimal = CDec(txtNumberGrade.Text) Dim letterGrade As String = "" If numberGrade &gt;= 88 Then letterGrade = "A" ElseIf numberGrade &gt;= 80 AndAlso numberGrade &lt;= 87 Then letterGrade = "B" ElseIf numberGrade &gt;= 68 AndAlso numberGrade &lt;= 79 Then letterGrade = "C" ElseIf numberGrade &gt;= 60 AndAlso numberGrade &lt;= 67 Then letterGrade = "D" Else letterGrade = "F" End If txtLetterGrade.Text = letterGrade txtNumberGrade.Select() Dim numberGrade1 As String = CStr(txtNumberGrade.Text) If numberGrade1 = "" Then MsgBox("This cannot be left blank!", MsgBoxStyle.Critical) ElseIf Not IsNumeric(numberGrade1) Then MsgBox("This has to be numeric!", MsgBoxStyle.Critical) End If End Sub Private Sub btnExit_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnExit.Click Me.Close() End Sub End Class
things run top to bottom. if you want to validate first, put that code first. you also have no "exit sub" on the error conditions.
Things are finally clicking I got it to work thanks man!
Oh I do work on Notepad++ and it was originally like this: &amp;nbsp; A|blah|blah|blah|blahblah D|blah|blah|blah|blah D|blah|blah|blah &amp;nbsp; Where A is the Header. But the value I'm working it removed all the CRLF and turned it into one big thing: &amp;nbsp; A|blah|blah|blah|blahblah| D|blah|blah|blah|blah D|blah|blah|blah &amp;nbsp; And now I'm at a loss on how to deal with it. Splitting it at the "D|" was something I did early on that worked but it ended up fucking me over at this realization. EDIT: Fixed formatting. Also just realized that the converter turned all CRLFs into spaces. So I could technically just make the delimiter " D|" but I'm not comfortable as an idiot proof solution.
No they aren't. My file is structured like this originally: &amp;nbsp; A|blah|blah|blah|blahblah D|blah|blah|blah|blah D|blah|blah|blah &amp;nbsp; then the converter I'm suppose to be working it removed everything even the crlf and turned it into this: &amp;nbsp; A|blah|blah|blah|blahblah D|blah|blah|blah|blah D|blah|blah|blah &amp;nbsp; And it didn't occur to me that something like this might happen: &amp;nbsp; A|blah|blah|blah|DIAMOND|blah|blah|blah|blah D|blah|blah|blah &amp;nbsp; Could you elaborate on CSV parsing? EDIT: I just reread the string and apparently, they replaced the CRLF with a space. Now I'm wondering if I should just make the delimter " D|" but it's still not 100% effective for me.
There are spaces around it. The converter I'm suppose to work with turned all the CRLFs into spaces. But it also had spaces originally too. The file was originally like this: &amp;nbsp; A|blah|blah|blah|blah blah D|blah|blah|blah|blah D|blah|blah|blah &amp;nbsp; And the converter turned it into this: &amp;nbsp; A|blah|blah|blah|blah blah D|blah|blah|blah|blah D|blah|blah|blah (note the spaces after every D). &amp;nbsp; I guess I could make the Split every " D|" (no quotes). But that wouldn't still be 100% idiot proof for me. EDIT: Format.
Text File was originally this: &amp;nbsp; A|blah|blah|blah|blah blah D|blah|blah|blah blah|blah D|blah|blah|blah &amp;nbsp; Converter turned it into this: &amp;nbsp; A|blah|blah|blah|blah blah D|blah|blah|blah blah|blah D|blah|blah|blah &amp;nbsp; Which I now have to work with. Note the space where the CRLF should've been. My task is to extract something from the D| line so I split it like this: &amp;nbsp; theArray = Split(mstrText,"D|") for i=1 to uBound (theArray) sDetail = Split(theArray(i),"|") &lt;stuff here&gt; next &amp;nbsp; And then I just realized, what if someone wrote the text file like this: A|blah|blah|blah|blah blah D|blah|D I A M O N D|blah blah|blah D|blah|blah|blah Then it'll all be ruined.
 D I A M O N D / I / I / A / A D I A M O N D M I O I O A N A N M D I A M O N D O / O / N / N / D I A M O N D

Could you elaborate a little bit? Currently at my job we use a shared Excel file with macros set up to import and sort our meetings and such. Generally speaking it sounds a lot like what OP is doing, but on a broader scale If I used a database and then connected it to excel where would our users input their meetings? Into the database directly through, say access, or through another tool? Also where is the lack of safety?
I see two ways: either a loop or select case method. What do you want the code to execute if it's 299 or 298, etc? Also are you trying to set it up for all numbers from 300-1?
Best answer as it is the simplest. Just want to note that youre missing a couple of "end if"
 For ii as integer = 1 to 300 If a &gt; ii then 'Do Work Exit For End If Next
as I understand it, excel itself has some sharing features, especially when used with onedrive, but the ODBC do not, and OLE is a clumbsy. in short, yes, you CAn do this with excel, if you're careful, and align all the stars right, but it's nearly the worst solution when what you want is a database.
it may be easier to restructure the file to use a non-data character as the leading char. and also report as a bug on the converter, that's just messed up.
So ... can you just not use the converter in the future, or is this a one time deal? Also, did it replace both the CR and LF?, or just one? Many Windows specific text editors will only show a line wrap on the CRLF combo, but there may still be one or the other in there. You could use an advanced text editor like notepad++ that will allow you to show any non printable characters. 
Oh cool, how would that work out ? yup! need to set it up for all numbers from 300 to 1 :)
Is the 'Do Work part the same for every value ? I'm trying to code 300 different variations 
I see, but you're code does not show what you going to do if a &lt;= 300. It only shows what you're going to do if a &gt; 300. So what are you going to do differently between each possibility &lt;= 300?
So help me out here what would you want to happen if it was 299? Or 298? How is the output changing for these?
Is this just a one time thing? Or is this going to happen all the time? In the sample you gave above, the third row has one column less than what the header has. Is this true with the data? Are there some rows that have less columns than other rows? If the number of pipes per row is uniform, you may be able to use that to add CrLf s back into the rows to normalize the data to then be able to process it.. The problem is, if the format of the data is constantly changing, then really, there is no actual way to automate. Garbage In, Garbage Out. It is like trying to get a DVD to play in a VHS player.
can you use the original file read it in one line at a time with the [streamreader.readline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/how-to-read-text-from-files-with-a-streamreader) this would create a single string that would only have the terminator at the beginning. I guess the real question is why are you converting it and losing the crlf?
Sorry for the late response! Which output message? The one in the first photo?
I was thinking that I might have to convert the swf into a dll and inject it that way, but after research I learned that it isn't possible to turn an swf into a dll file. I don't know. I'm just very upset that the original creator shut down the hack and that I have no way to contact him, and my best bet of using such a great hack is taking the files he left behind and trying to recreate it. 
it means you variable name cannot have a full stop. variable.name would be illegal whereas variable_name would be ok.
I will be writing different values in lx_data for each case. looking for an elegant way of doing this, rather than having to manually code all 300 cases. can it be done by importing data from an excel file ?
My bad. I have added that as well. I will be writing different values in lx_data for each case. looking for an elegant way of doing this, rather than having to manually code all 300 cases. can it be done by importing data from an excel file ? https://pastebin.com/CvKN7HTn
To add on: this is because the period is used to signify that you're calling something that's part of the object, like a function or a property. For instance, all string variables have the built-in functions which you will call with stringName.length. Imagine the chaos if your variable was called string.name!
Sure so say you had your data in rows 1-300 corresponding to the value you want. You'd have to initialize your excel objects and then you could use a for loop to pull that data. Something like For i = 300 to 1 Step -1 If a &gt; i then xlString = Worksheets(1).Cells(i, 1). Value 'use xlString here as you need it Exit for End if Next i 
I'd say you need to declare a form level variable that the timer can access. Set it in the loop to say that the loop is running. Check the value of that variable in the timer.
The problem is I have around 1500 .frm files to check. That's way too much work. I'm only asking here because I ran out of ideas.
Ooooh. Jeepers. So you want to determine if there is any other loop running anywhere else in the app?
Yes. But I guess there is no pretty way to do it. Probably I will just search for any DoEvents on every single file. And replace it with some global variable = true plus DoEvents.
Yeah that could do it.
Out of curiosity, do you have source version control? Source safe or similar?
have you tried adding the activex control to your project? that was the only time i remember having to mess with dlls
make a function that does that and just replace the doevents with the function name. easier to search/replace since vb doesn't do multiline, and also easy to reverse if you need to 
Yes, source safe.
Okay..Thank you !
So for example txtName.text shouldn't be variable name. No ? 
Yes, you should not have a variable named txtName.text. However, if txtName is an object - like say a textbox - then txtName.text would refer to the text property of the object. 
Is there just a single timer that you're worried about? 
Right. Thank you very much !
I did a quick browse on your code and it appears that it asks the user for input on line 81 and checks to see if the user entered "A". If the user did not enter "A" (as you said the user enters "D") then it falls through the IF statement and the next line of code to get executed will be line 106 which calls intro3(). I recommend stepping through your code with a debugger and seeing where your steps take you. That is usually how I find out why my code is taking an unexpected path... Edit: It would take me some time to walk through your code and figure out your structuring, but my first guess is that you want to combine your IF statement on line 81 to include handling of the other option(s). So after you do your handling for the user entering "A" then you do ElseIF userinput = "D" Or userinput = "d" and include the handling for "D". This change will need to be compatible with the structure of the rest of your program and the path the code will follow. Good luck!
Since wildcards are not supported in FileExists, you may want to use the GetFolder method instead
Ok I tried your answer but it didn't work... My current code: Option Explicit DIM fso Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject") If (fso.GetFolder("C:\Tempzxpsign*")) Then WScript.Echo("File exists!") WScript.Quit() Else WScript.Echo("File does not exist!") End If WScript.Quit() And it spits out this error: Can't find path Error code: 800A004C Edit: The place the script is placed in is "C:\Users\INSERTUSERNAMEHERE\Documents\Scripts\Startphotoshop.vbs"
Well you'll definitely get an error for getfolder if it's not there. What you could do is create an error handler. On error goto errHandler From there you can do a check for the error. If the error is that number (800A...) you can resume next and pass along a flag stating whether or not the file exists 
This should do what you're looking for: Option Explicit DIM fso Dim SubFolder Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject") For Each SubFolder In fso.GetFolder("C:\TestParent").SubFolders If Mid(SubFolder,InstrRev(SubFolder,"\") + 1,4) = "Test" then 'fso.DeleteFolder(SubFolder) WScript.Echo("Found: " &amp; SubFolder) End if Next WScript.Quit()
You need an equals sign between Checked and True on a bunch of lines. Or you can just delete True. 
If you already have the infrastructure to create the picture box, and you want to make more instances then it sounds like you want an array. I am guessing that you don't really want an infinite number so the array size will be the actual number of picture boxes you allow... so like a circular buffer. Just keep re-using the "expired" pictureboxes instead of disposing/re-instancing them. Hope this helps.
I just tried out some new code, can you help identify where I'm going wrong? Public Bullets(0) As PictureBox Dim ShotCount As Integer Private Sub Form1_KeyPress(sender As Object, e As KeyPressEventArgs) Handles Me.KeyPress Dim pt As Point pt.X = 400 pt.Y = 300 If e.KeyChar = " " Then ShotCount += 1 ReDim Bullets(ShotCount) Bullets(ShotCount) = New PictureBox Bullets(ShotCount).Location = pt Bullets(ShotCount).Width = 2 Bullets(ShotCount).Height = 2 Me.Controls.Add(Bullets(ShotCount)) End If End Sub
Oh wow.... That's embarrassing. Thanks for pointing that out. I find that with coding, I always miss the smallest things, and that messes everything out. 
I don't see any serious issue at first glance. Can you describe what sort of problem(s) you are having? The only issue I see is that your array will continue to grow as long as the game is playing. I expect you will fire thousands of shots in a game, but only have 2-3 shots on screen at any time. If you treat the array as a circular buffer then you just keep re-assigning the location to "new" shots once they have "expired" (gone off screen). So maybe begin by declaring Bullets(3) for 3 shots, then track the positions of each bullet. Once a bullet leaves the screen then it gets recycled with a new starting position. Good luck
FYI, VB6 is now obsolete. Modern IDEs don't support VB6.
Err, not VB6, just Visual Basic. Unless that is the same thing.
If you're just looking for VB.NET, then the [VS Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&amp;rel=15) is the correct one. It may be slow for you due to its fairly high minimum requirements.
It is :( Which is why I figured Visual Code would be a good alternative.
use visual studio 2010 or 2012
You might want to try grouping 3 listboxes together into a "custom class". I often create object groups when I need something that is not "off-the-shelf". Luckily .NET lets you do this fairly easily. You could also include an "items.add" method which would take the 3 arguments passed through items.add, and apply them to each listbox in your group. Good luck!
Don't feel bad. I've been coding for 30 years and I still make those sort of mistakes (I suppose I can blame old age now...) I guess what makes it more confusing is that the code checker allows those sorts of mistakes because they are syntactically valid... but give you unexpected results.
The ListBox control supports multicolumn "off the shelf". It has a property [MultiColumn](https://msdn.microsoft.com/query/dev12.query?appId=Dev12IDEF1&amp;l=EN-US&amp;k=k\(System.Windows.Forms.ListBox.MultiColumn\);k\(System.Windows.Forms.ListBox\);k\(VS.Properties\);k\(TargetFrameworkMoniker-.NETFramework,Version%3Dv4.0\)&amp;rd=true) which is a boolean that defaults to false.
Try; lstRates.Items.Add("1. Rug cleaner, $16.00, $24.00") lstRates.Items.Add("2. Lawn mower, $12.00, $18.00") lstRates.Items.Add("3. Paint sprayer, $20.00, $30.00")
In line 37 your calculation is wrong(or one of your values, depends on how you want to solve it)
Check this out for homework help! https://assignmentdue.com/programming-assignment-help.php
This. You calculate the amount to be discounted from the total cost, but you return that amount instead of subtracting it from total. In your example, $5.63 is the total discount. Now you need to subtract the total discount from the price. ($56.25 - $5.63 = $50.62)
https://pastebin.com/XRUSSLLz I just did the problem myself, it doesn't have your variables but you should be able to workout where you went wrong. 
Those are VB6 files, so you'll need to download / install VB6.
You'd have to track down a copy of the ancient Visual Basic 6 IDE, which isn't officially being sold anymore and will probably have issues running on modern Windows versions. Honestly, getting it to run would probably be more effort than learning another language and writing a new one.
If the code is complete, you can zip it and post a link and I would compile it for you into an exe.
I have an old copy lying around I think, if anyone is interested I'll try to dig it up.
Alright, I went in and fixed the equations. Now it works perfectly. Thank you. One thing I find a bit counter-intuitive is the fact that I can't declare the value of a variable like this: Dim orderCost As Double = numPounds * singlePound I'm sure in the reasoning behind the syntax makes sense, but it would be nice to fit it all on one line like that. 
You can get the code for the userform in the `frm` file by opening it in a text editor. You can then recreate the userform itself, and update your code to work with VB.NET.
This doesn't really answer you question, but a pong game is probably something you can redo in an hour or two, and it would be a good exercise in getting yourself up to speed with more current technologies. Why not rebuild it?
Early Visual Studio .net versions had a converter tool, but it's pretty much impossible to find these days. Your code is most likely entirely in the FRM, and you can open that up in a text editor to grab it. Most of it will more or less work in .NET with some modifications.
 Private Sub btnCalculate_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnCalculate.Click Dim begInv As Double Dim endInv As Double Dim avgInv As Double Dim turnover As Double Dim costSold As Double Try begInv = Double.Parse(txtBegInv.Text) Catch ex As FormatException MessageBox.Show("Please check your values.", "Beginning Inventory Error") With txtBegInv.Focus End With End Try Try endInv = Double.Parse(txtEndInv.Text) Catch ex As FormatException MessageBox.Show("Please check your values.", "Ending Inventory Error") With txtEndInv.Focus End With End Try Try costSold = Decimal.Parse(txtCostSold.Text) Catch ex As FormatException MessageBox.Show("Please check your values.", "Cost of Goods Sold Error") With txtCostSold.Focus End With End Try avgInv = (begInv + endInv) / 2 turnover = Math.Round(costSold / avgInv, 1) txtAvgInv.Text = avgInv.ToString("C") txtTurnover.Text = turnover.ToString End Sub End Class After some trial and error that is what I came up with. My only problem now is even when an error occurs, the formulas still execute and give me an output. How would I avoid that? 
When you CATCH you will want to add; return Without the "return" keywork the code continues
For one, get rid of the With textboxname.focus end with that you have 3 times. You just need textboxname.focus There is no need for a with block when calling a single method on an object, and its not being used correctly in your syntax anyway. As to your question, if an exception is hit, you should have an "exit sub" in the catch block so that it will exit the subroutine when an error is hit and not process the last 4 lines of code which are your calculations.
Ok thank you. My response to your With/End suggestion is that he wants all the text to be highlighted using the With/End technique. Wrong or right it's what he wants. Is there a way to have all text highlighted when the text box gets focus.
 with textboxname .focus .SelectAll end with
Any particular reasons why the .SelectAll option is not appearing or working for me for either method? I like what you suggested, also. Why do the With/End With when it's not actually necessary? Thank you.
Post the code that isn't working for you.
The [`Mod`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/operators/mod-operator) operator divides 2 numbers and returns the remainder of the division. For example, `9 Mod 10 = 9` `10 Mod 10 = 0` `11 Mod 10 = 1` And the output will always be from 0 to 9. Dim count As Integer = 0 For i As Integer = 0 To 20 MessageBox.Show(i Mod 10) Next 
thanks!
Thanks for the help man!
I usually use Exit Sub I don't know what the difference would be between Return or just to Exit Sub. 
I believe you want to look into [custom string/date formats](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/custom-date-and-time-format-strings) GetCompareDate = WorkingTable.Rows(CurrentRow).Item(DateItem).Format("MM/dd")
Remove everything after "as Integer" for your first two variables. You're trying to get a value for objects that have not yet been initiated. If what you want to do is update txtScore and txtScoreCount with the new score, you'll have to do that in your click event. 
Format(whatever, "dd/MM/yy hh:nn")
Yeah, you're using the variable, but not the text box.
So far all you've done is allow the symbols to be inputted into the textbox. That's a good start. The next step is to actually write code to interpret what's in the textbox and then actually perform the calculation. This is possibly trickier than you might imagine, but you might want to look into [string manipulation](https://www.dotnetperls.com/string-vbnet). 
in short, string parsing. if you plan to limit it to simple operations you just need to look in the string to find a + - * or / and then split/explode the string on that character to get your 2 numbers, then math...
I once found a way of doing exactly what you want: translate a string into a calculation without any sort of string manipulations etc, and have the result returned. I'll see if I can find the code tomorrow.
