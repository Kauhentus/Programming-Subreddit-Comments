I guess you want the statenames to show below the headline states? If so try initializing you variable VerticalPrintLocationSingle not with zero. Currently you start the statenames at position y+lineheightsingle. Try this Dim VerticalPrintLocationSingle As Single = 100 
Oh wow. Now I feel retarded. THANK YOU!
That was an easy mistake. You should, however, feel bad for using Comic Sans.
My course instructor is forcing us to use it. It's cancer, I know :(
It was a few minutes difference, so it probably wasn't here when you wrote yours. Have my upvote.
You sir are a miracle in Reddit. 
well, i'll assume you have a fixed set of coins, first generate all possible combinations then calculate their value
If you're using doubles, you might be accumulating errors in some of the calculations and then comparing 0.99999999999999 = 1 (which will be false). Try using integers or longs and work in pennies (so you'll compare to 100 instead of 1.00)
your integer math is fine, and slightly off-topic, but what's really gourd-shaking is the fact that [different implementations of VB use different rounding strategies](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/196652) so that code snipped OP has will return different results for rounding at .5 depending on if it was used in VBA or VB6, etc. I don't know about ebasic. This has bitten me on the ass a few times over the years. 
it is a long winded way but you need something like this: ' Declare variables as assign results. Dim runner1Name As String = Runner1NameTextBox.Text Dim runner1Time As Decimal = CDec(Runner1TimeTextBox.Text) Dim runner2Name As String = Runner2NameTextBox.Text Dim runner2Time As Decimal = CDec(Runner2TimeTextBox.Text) Dim runner3Name As String = Runner3NameTextBox.Text Dim runner3Time As Decimal = CDec(Runner3TimeTextBox.Text) ' Display the results. If (runner1Time &lt; runner2Time) Then If (runner1Time &lt; runner3Time) Then ' runner1 is first. FirstPlaceLabel.Text = runner1Name If (runner2Time &lt; runner3Time) Then ' runner2 is second. SecondPlaceLabel.Text = runner2Name ' runner3 is third. ThirdPlaceLabel.Text = runner3Name Else ' runner3 is second. SecondPlaceLabel.Text = runner3Name ' runner2 is third. ThirdPlaceLabel.Text = runner3Name End If End If Else If (runner2Time &lt; runner3Time) Then ' runner2 first. FirstPlaceLabel.Text = runner2Name If (runner1Time &lt; runner3Time) Then ' runner1 is second. SecondPlaceLabel.Text = runner1Name ' runner3 is third. ThirdPlaceLabel.Text = runner3Name Else ' runner3 is second. SecondPlaceLabel.Text = runner3Name ' runner1 is third. ThirdPlaceLabel.Text = runner1Name End If Else ' runner3 first. FirstPlaceLabel.Text = runner3Name If (runner1Time &lt; runner2Time) Then ' runner1 second. SecondPlaceLabel.Text = runner1Name ' runner2 third. ThirdPlaceLabel.Text = runner2Name Else ' runner2 second. SecondPlaceLabel.Text = runner2Name ' runner1 thrid. ThirdPlaceLabel.Text = runner1Name End If End If End If 
Or you could just write 6 lines of code: ' Declare variables as assign results. Dim runnerNames() As String = {Runner1NameTextBox.Text, Runner2NameTextBox.Text, Runner3NameTextBox.Text} Dim runnerTimes() As Decimal = {CDec(Runner1TimeTextBox.Text), CDec(Runner2TimeTextBox.Text), CDec(Runner3TimeTextBox.Text)} ' Calculate the results. Array.Sort(runnerTimes, runnerNames) ' Display the results. FirstPlaceLabel.Text = runnerNames(0) SecondPlaceLabel.Text = runnerNames(1) ThirdPlaceLabel.Text = runnerNames(2)
Damn, never knew you could sort 2 arrays like that. Cool.
Thanks, my Googlefu is not the best when it comes to programming.
So you have four dates: start1, end1, start2, end2. Assume that start1 &lt; start2. dim overlap as TimeSpan = end2 - start1 'subtracting date/times give you a timespan if overlap.ticks &lt; 0 then Console.WriteLine ("no overlap") else Console.WriteLine("Overlap " &amp; overlap.TotalHours) 
There are two big problems with your loop: 1. If-then-elseif blocks don't check every elseif. Once one of them matches the rest are ignored. Read through the block and consider carefully how that impacts your loop. 2. You have a loop but inside the loop there is no way to guess a number. Considering you want people to guess higher or lower numbers that seems like a pretty big issue.
Thanks for the help. I managed to get it working. I'll edit the post and submit the new code to show what I did.
That's what I was trying to avoid. I figured that much, but maybe there would be a way to use the Y value as a variable and set up an integer to apply to that set? Idk. 
This is because you Re-Dim LevelIndicatorLabel every time you click the button. ' Problem Dim LevelIndicatorLabel As Integer = 1 ... LevelIndicatorLabel += 1 Every time you click the button LevelIndicatorLabel will be reset to 1 then increment by 1, thus giving you "2". If you wish to continue to increment the variable, simply declare it one time at the class level rather than button_Click event. 
It's not wanting to work for me. I have Dim LevelIndicatorLabel As Integer = 1 On class level and then... Level.Text = ? I keep getting an error whenever I put the LevelIndicatorLabel there. 
I don't see anything specifically wrong, here. I've zipped my little sample project if you want to reference it. Download [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/u59jtna05nmt9b7/CharacterLevelUp.7z?dl=0)
Alright, so I got two labels mixed up. It should've been LevelIndicatorLevel instead of LevelIndicatorLabel... -_- Changing the names for easier future reference &amp; it's working great! Thanks a ton!
I was messing up on my own. Got two Label Names confused. Thanks so much for all the help!
It is for our school project. We want to develop a login system for our school that can track what the student does or opens. Still have no idea how to start though. It kinda invades the privacy of the students but our intention is to create an advanced security for the computer laboratories and to ensure the education of the students using the laboratory.
It is only a thesis proposal, it will be their decision though to use it or not. Our college dean already accepted it though mentioning that the proposal will be really useful for the staffs to regulate the laboratories. I don't know about privacy violations though as we are just ordinary IT students and currently has no available resources to get a lawyer.
Well to start, you aren't going to be able to build "Advanced Security" software that runs on a VM framework like .NET does. For example, AV/Security software generally use filter drivers inserted into the network stack to monitor and enforce network protection. So you will need C++ for that, and a strong knowledge of networking protocols and writing drivers for Windows. That is of course just one aspect. Anything you build in VB (or based on .NET in generally really) that is to act as security on a system is going to be very easy to defeat and bypass.
Having the code written in directly wouldn't be practical though since there's a good 3 pages or so of code preceding it. It could just trigger it using a boolean I suppose, but it's still messier than I'd like. Out of curiosity, why was it that my subs (even those within the form) where't working either. I always figured they existed within that form and the program just kinda skip over to them when it was running the program - is that not the case?
Were you trying to access public or private subs? You need to set them to public in order to access subs between modules.
All public. I don't think the issue is the modules either, because I specifically had to enter that I wanted to reference an object in form2 - not the module itself or the form the original test code was in. But again, I there was only an example of how it could be done in the thread I found - not an explanation of what it actually does - so I really don't know what's going wrong.
Without seeing the code, it's hard to say what might be going wrong.
Is this what you had in mind? Public Sub Test() Dim Count As Integer = 0 Dim lbl As New Label Do Until Count = 11 lbl.Name = "Label" &amp; Count Form2.Controls.Add(lbl) MsgBox(lbl.Name) lbl.Text = "Frogs" Count += 1 Loop Form2.Show() End Sub
Not quite as convenient, but yeah, that looks like it'd work. Thanks!
When creating the controls, add them to a list. Thereafter, you can just iterate through the list and just do whatever you need to do. For instance, if I have a label named lblName, I'll add it to a list full of lblNames like this... Dim lblNameList as New List(of Label) lblNameList.Add(lblName) And then later, iterate through it with... For Each lbl in LblNameList 'do whatever to the label through the variable 'lbl' Next 
add a breakpoint and step through the code?
I'll give it a crack tonight and see how it goes.
The Game is in If then statements that trigger from a button. My initial thought was just to move the buttons (and therefore the code for the game) into Select Case. Select Case Case 0 Private Sub btn_Click () If then End Sub End Case That's what I thought in my head to make, but when I put the buttons Private Sub btn_Click into a Case, Visual Studio tells me that it doesn't belong there, I get the red squiggly lines. I forget the exact error off hand.
Issue #2: totalProfit = +sepProfits should be totalProfit += sepProfits or totalProfit = totalProfit + sepProfit ' no confusion possible here. Currently, you're just setting totalProfits to the current sepProfit each pass through the loop.
Each BindingList has only one "current" item... if you wish to bind different controls to different items in the list, you'll need to use multiple BindingLists. Dim lst = New List(Of Player) lst.Add(...) ' fill the list here Dim bl1 = New BindingList(Of Player)(lst) Dim bl2 = New BindingList(Of Player)(lst) Then bind one combo to bl1 and the other to bl2.
Pretty sure all of this stuff is stored in the registry. Check out here: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/819961
So I'll have to do that per new line of objects? There is really no max on how many levels a Player can have and I'll need these per level.
I was thinking the same thing. A batch script to edit the registry. 
There were a few people online who went down that route. If it's the only option then I'll have to. I just feel there should be a simpler way to perform this using the class from the link I posted.
Thanks a million. Both solutions were so simple but I just couldn't quite hit the mark. I'm pretty new to queries so it tripped me up a bit.
This is the code for the form: Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Dim clsProxy As New IEProxy If clsProxy.SetProxy("123.123.123.123:8080") Then MessageBox.Show("Proxy successfully enabled.", "Success", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Information) Else MessageBox.Show("Error enabling proxy.", "Failed", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Exclamation) End If End Sub Private Sub Button2_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button2.Click Dim clsProxy As New IEProxy If clsProxy.DisableProxy Then MessageBox.Show("Proxy successfully disabled.", "Success", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Information) Else MessageBox.Show("Error disabling proxy.", "Failed", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Exclamation) End If End Sub
 Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Dim magicnumber = 0 For Each letter In TextBox1.Text.Trim.ToUpperInvariant magicnumber = magicnumber + (AscW(letter) - 65) Mod 9 + 1 Next MsgBox("Your magic number is " &amp; magicnumber) End Sub Explanation of how it works: A) **For each letter in**... will loop through all the letters in the textbox. B) **.Text.Trim.ToUpperInvariant** removes any spaces before or after and converts the text to uppercase (only for the loop; the textbox itself is not modified) C) **AscW()** is a function that return the ASCII code of the letter. A = 65, B = 66, ... Z = 90. ASCII codes is how the computer internally represents letter (not really true for VB.Net, since it's Unicode, but good enough for our purpose here...) D) The formula subtracts 65 from the ASCII value, so that A = 0, B = 1, ... E) **Mod 9** is modulo division, it will make the value 0..25 loop 0..8, 0..8, 0..7 F) Adding **+ 1** will make the loop 1..9, 1..9, 1..8 G) Adding the value of the formula for each letter gives you your magic number. 
[Here's a screenshot of what I'm looking for with the layout.](http://imgur.com/LVV8zbj)
I'm on lunch right now, but in about 30 mins I'll post the code for what the button does. 
so does it go like this?: Dim magicnumber = 0 For Each letter In TextBox1.Text.Trim.ToUpperInvariant magicnumber = magicnumber + (AscW(letter) - 65) Mod 9 + 1 Next MsgBox("Your magic number is " &amp; magicnumber) Function SumOfDigits(number As Integer) As Integer Dim sum = 0 Do While (number &lt;&gt; 0) sum += number Mod 10 number \= 10 Loop Return sum End Function
The function needs to be placed outside the click event. Like this: Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Dim magicnumber = 0 For Each letter In TextBox1.Text.Trim.ToUpperInvariant magicnumber = magicnumber + (AscW(letter) - 65) Mod 9 + 1 Next magicnumber = SumOfDigits(magicnumber) ' I think this is what you want... MsgBox("Your magic number is " &amp; magicnumber) End Sub Function SumOfDigits(number As Integer) As Integer Dim sum = 0 Do While (number &lt;&gt; 0) sum += number Mod 10 number \= 10 Loop Return sum End Function
I have tried your provided code. For the option to not use the proxy for the local network you already write the settings in the proxy class: opts(2).pszValue = Marshal.StringToHGlobalAnsi("local") but it must be opts(2).pszValue = Marshal.StringToHGlobalAnsi("**&lt;local&gt;**") to work. For the automatic settings when disabling the proxy you need to add this (technically only the &amp;H8 ...): **PROXY_TYPE_AUTO_PROXY_URL = &amp;H4** **PROXY_TYPE_AUTO_DETECT = &amp;H8** at the end of Enum Options Public Enum Options INTERNET_PER_CONN_FLAGS = 1 INTERNET_PER_CONN_PROXY_SERVER = 2 INTERNET_PER_CONN_PROXY_BYPASS = 3 INTERNET_PER_CONN_AUTOCONFIG_URL = 4 INTERNET_PER_CONN_AUTODISCOVERY_FLAGS = 5 INTERNET_OPTION_REFRESH = 37 INTERNET_OPTION_PER_CONNECTION_OPTION = 75 INTERNET_OPTION_SETTINGS_CHANGED = 39 PROXY_TYPE_PROXY = &amp;H2 PROXY_TYPE_DIRECT = &amp;H1 PROXY_TYPE_AUTO_PROXY_URL = &amp;H4 PROXY_TYPE_AUTO_DETECT = &amp;H8 End Enum and use it here (last line): Public Function DisableProxy() As Boolean Dim bReturn As Boolean Dim list As New INTERNET_PER_CONN_OPTION_LIST Dim dwBufSize As Integer = Marshal.SizeOf(list) Dim opts(0) As INTERNET_PER_CONN_OPTION Dim opt_size As Integer = Marshal.SizeOf(opts(0)) list.dwSize = dwBufSize list.pszConnection = ControlChars.NullChar list.dwOptionCount = 1 opts(0).dwOption = Options.INTERNET_PER_CONN_FLAGS opts(0).dwValue = Options.PROXY_TYPE_AUTO_DETECT instead of **opts(0).dwValue = Options.PROXY_TYPE_DIRECT** **opts(0).dwValue = Options.PROXY_TYPE_AUTO_DETECT** as far as I tested it here that should work 
As far as I get it you want to first collect a number of values and then at some point do something with them. I like to use **Lists** for this, as it is easy to add and remove stuff from them. (they are like an advanced array): Public Class ListExample Private ListOfValues As New List(Of String) 'A list of string values (kind of a more advanced array) Private Sub btnAdd_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnAdd.Click ListOfValues.Add(ddlFromBuilding.Text) 'Add a value to the list End Sub Private Sub btnCreatePDF_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnCreatePDF.Click For Each ListEntry As String In ListOfValues 'This goes through all the individual values one after the other 'Write this value to the PDF 'for example: Textbox.text = ListEntry Next ListOfValues.Clear() 'this empties the list End Sub End Class as you can see, you have the **ListOfValues** and you add entries to that list and when you create the lines in your PDF you have to use a **Loop** (the For/Next) to go through all the entries of that list from the first to the last value and each iteration has that value in the variable **ListEntry** and you can do something with it.
SpineWave, wow! Thank you so much for being so clear and concise, and patient with a noob such as myself. I've caught so much flak from others on my obvious inability to code properly, and you truly are the first person (out of so many forums) to give any help. THANK YOU!! One question: As I intend to give your idea a try, I have to create more acrofields within my PDF doc in order to add lines. Do you have an idea on what I may need to do to tell my output to go to a new field in the PDF? For example let's say I have a field called FromBuilding1 in my PDF, then for the next line, my field would be FromBuiliding2. How do I tell my program that the next entry goes into the next line? I apologize if I am unclear. Either way thank you thank you!
Are these variables global? (dim'ed in the `(Declarations)` section, not in any of your subs) 
No, they're in the sub of my calculation button's click event. I'll reply with the code here in a few so you can see
Public Class frmMain Private Sub AssignCharge(ByVal decAdd As Decimal) Select Case decAdd Case radRed.Checked decAdd = 10 Case radPink.Checked decAdd = 15 Case Else decAdd = 0 End Select End Sub Private Sub ClearLabels() lblPrice.Text = String.Empty End Sub Private Sub btnExit_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnExit.Click Me.Close() End Sub Private Sub btnCalc_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnCalc.Click ' displays the total Const decSTANDARD As Decimal = 159 Const decLOVE As Decimal = 189 Const decFUN As Decimal = 189 Dim decPrice As Decimal ' calculate subtotal If radStandard.Checked = True Then decPrice = decSTANDARD ElseIf radGym.Checked = True Then decPrice = decLOVE ElseIf radCheer.Checked = True Then decPrice = decFUN End If ' apply additional charges Call AssignCharge(decPrice) ' display subtotal, discount, and total due lblPrice.Text = decPrice.ToString("C2") End Sub Private Sub radStandard_CheckedChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles radStandard.CheckedChanged Call ClearLabels() End Sub Private Sub radGym_CheckedChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles radGym.CheckedChanged Call ClearLabels() End Sub Private Sub radCheer_CheckedChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles radCheer.CheckedChanged Call ClearLabels() End Sub Private Sub radBlue_CheckedChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles radBlue.CheckedChanged Call ClearLabels() End Sub Private Sub radRed_CheckedChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles radRed.CheckedChanged Call ClearLabels() End Sub Private Sub radPink_CheckedChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles radPink.CheckedChanged Call ClearLabels() End Sub End Class 
Damn, that probably would work. The only downside is that the instructions are to use a Sub, haven't touched functions yet in the course. Otherwise I probably would've deviated from calling a sub
Just from the error message I would say you are trying to do something like this (?): Dim Test(1) As String = {"Test1", "Test2"} but as the error message says you can only do this: Dim Test(1) As String or this (*not both at the same time*): Dim Test() As String = {"Test1", "Test2"} *but I am not quite sure what you are explicitly trying to do when you get the error* 
Yes, we're supposed to have a name constant declaring the size of the array. So it'd be like Const maxAddins As Integer = 6 Dim AddIns(maxAddins) As String = {"Cream", "Cinnamon", "Chocolate", "Amaretto", "Whiskey"} ' here is where I get the error, we have to a have a named constant tied to this array but everything I do gives an error.
At least from the text you provided, I don't really see where it says that you need to declare the size that way and I would be suprised if it did, it just doesn't make sense do do it: Dim Test() As String = {"Test1", "Test2"} what you assign to the array (right of =) overrides all the information of the array, you tell the array there are 2 entries "Test1" and "Test2" in that order it is the same as doing this: Dim Test(1) As String 'an array with 2 empty entries Test(0) = "Test1" 'write what is in the first entry Test(1) = "Test2" 'write what is in the second entry even if you would not get an error when you do this: Dim Test(1) As String = {"Test1", "Test2"} the information Test(**1**) would be lost and completly overriden by **= {"Test1", "Test2"}** Of course it may make sense to have *Const maxAddins As Integer = 6* in general and just check before you put more stuff into the array, if it already has 6 entries and then not add anything or something similar. Or you could do this: Dim Test(6) As String 'an array with 7(!! 0-6) empty entries Test(0) = "Test1" 'write what is in the first entry Test(1) = "Test2" 'write what is in the second entry That way you have an array with 7 entries and the first to have the values "Test1", "Test2" Maybe you should start with the user input etc. and see what variables you really need to have all the required functions.
first, some questions: What commands have you learned so far? Have you used any loops (FOR, DO WHILE, WHILE)? What environment are you programming in? 
The answer will depend on what you are expected to use to perform this. Most ways are going to be pretty easy. I'm going to assume that you are to use an array to store the inputted values as this would only be a couple of lines of code with a generic list. What you would do is create a loop with an input box. With each iteration of the loop, check to see if the value is already in the array (looping through the array and checking for equality against the input). If not, add the input to the array and repeat. If it is already there then you just need to loop through the array and add the elements to the listbox and set the label to the count of the array. 
Ya dont use teh built in draw commands they are slow. check out this old system for GDI+ https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa984108(v=vs.71).aspx
&gt;Private intTips(19) As Integer Have you tried: Public intTips(19) As Integer
At first glance this looks simple, but you need to have the user enter at least one number before you can do any comparison. Use a list. Have the user enter one number to start and add it to the list. After the first number is entered, for each subsequent number: Check the list for a match each time the user enters a new number. If there is no match then add the number to the list. If there is a match then loop through the list and add the numbers to the listbox.
That worked, thx
It's hard to tell on mobile but are you painting on the window or double buffering. I.e. drawing to a bitmap in memory and then rendering that in one go? That makes a huge difference in performance.
Not too familiar with vb, but it looks like you're initializing the array with a 7 then trying to put 8 values into it (0-7). Edit: Turns out you do have it initialized right never mind.
BBM? 
 random.Next(1,5) * 25 or, more generally Dim possibleNumbers = { 25, 50, 75, 100 } Dim number = possibleNumbers(random.Next(0, numbers.Length))
I would convert the values to strings and populate an array using the filter function after each entry to check for duplicates and adding the new values if not found or populating the list when a duplicate is found. It about 5 minutes of code
 Total = num + total
Sorry, VBA. Was typing that message on my crappy Blackberry which always wants to autocorrect ever acronym into blackberry acronym. Don't buy a blackberry. 
what type of object is ImagesWT? (I can't see the declaration code) I'm guessing you can't set the length property of imagesWT? 
&gt; Shit... Aren't the instances automatic? welp... nevermind &gt; I got to used to Visual studio doing things for me ffs. Instances never really *were* automatic. You can do this with VBA and UserForms, but not really with VB.NET and WinForms. It's a much better practice to instantiate a new form class to a variable, do whatever work you that it was needed for, and&amp;mdash;once finished&amp;mdash;dispose of it so it isn't hanging around in memory unnecessarily. You can use the `Using` statement block to simplify this process even better. This practice is also much more useful when there may be multiple purposes for a form because it ensures the class is loaded freshly and no previous data or settings are left behind.
Well... after years of coding and still learning basics, jesus. Nobody would believe me if I said I was learning Machine Learning. Thanks for the lesson so much. BTW there's no problem declaring the, in my case MdiChildren, forms outside of sub and functions right as global variables. This may seem obvious but I just want to make sure there's no nuance.
Same. The loop is a bit awkward. Could defiantly be trimmed down some.
Definitely agree with the comments about using an integer to store a double amount. Now for your out of bounds error. When you iterate through your loop you end with a: Next i This will go from 0 to 7 for the loop. Then it will iterate again to 8 and step out of the loop. Then you try to assign a value with i: Averages(i) = BatAvg Averages(i) = CInt(Console.ReadLine()) At his point i = 8 and is outside the bounds of your array. (Edited for formatting)
You can create a dataset in the report and pass your own dataset to the report itself so long as the dataset name and columns match. 
I was thinking of making custom rows (eg: concatenated rows) for my dataset query. From what I've seen on the report wizard, that isn't possible?
Images WT was an array like so Dim ImagesWT() As String = {"img1.jpg", "img2.jpg", "img3.jpg", "img4.jpg"} I stopped using an array and just used If statements and a counter in the timer code to make it work which was less efficient but works 
Nope, standard Windows Forms. 
**If** the strings are always in that format... array3=Split(string2,",") string3=array3[2]
I don't understand what you mean by this, I'm a beginner to VB Maybe what I have so far will help. One section of my program compares two strings, and if they are diffrent, a treeview with a list of players names is updated using an json response from my web server. This part I have working great, but I'm looking to add in a message box that pops up and tells me which player had joined, or which player has left. I have this so far: Dim txt1 As String = TextBox1.Text Dim comma1 As String = Regex.Replace(txt1, ",", "comma") Dim trimmed1 As String = Regex.Replace(comma1, "[^\w\.@-]", "") Dim result1 As String = Regex.Replace(trimmed1, "comma", ", ") Dim txt2 As String = TextBox2.Text Dim comma2 As String = Regex.Replace(txt2, ",", "comma") Dim trimmed2 As String = Regex.Replace(comma2, "[^\w\.@-]", "") Dim result2 As String = Regex.Replace(trimmed2, "comma", ", ") Which formats the names of the players from ["player1, player2"] to player1, player2 Could you explain a little more how I would fit this into the code I have so far? I'd need to compare result2 and result1 and get the diffrence in a string that I can display in a label
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.split.aspx https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb301504.aspx https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb336848.aspx
Yeah, but you can type and ignore intellisense. 
Just throwing out ideas here, how about storing each element entered into a multidimensional array? You can store the value, and the operation associated with it in the array, and process the operations within it using PEMDAS in order to achieve a final result. Your given example would be stored as the following: 75*2-4+6 'In array format 75,+ 2,* 4,- 6,+ 'First step in processing using P E MD AS +75*2= +150 150,+ 4,- 6,+ 'Second step in processing using P E MD AS +150-4+6= +152 'Final value stored in array 152,+ Edit: Hell, I'd go so far as to store your entire user input in string format as it is entered by the user, then parse it afterward so you can further include parenthesis as well. This would also enable your calculator to process equations by the user literally typing them in. (This is only ideas being thrown out there, might be a lot of work to ensure parsing works 100%)
I have done both of these things however I am still getting an error message. To add the details to the database I have done the following: forename= txtForename.text sqlCmd.Parameters.AddWithValue (@Forename, forename) Does the primary key need to be added using a similar technique? 
Is your ID column set as a Primary Key?
Sounds like you are expecting SQL to generate that ID for you, but offhand I don't see how you can get it to do it the way you're going it other than to set it yourself. The easiest way in that case would be to first run a sorted query (descending) on the ID field, return the highest value, then increment in code, and write that value back. Any reasons to not consider using Entity Framework? With EF generating the Identity is as easy as: &lt;Key&gt; &lt;DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)&gt; Public Property ID As Integer
Found the mistake. It was within the stored procedure. I had as follows: @BookingID int @Forename, varchar (20) I removed the adding of @BookingID and it worked. Very hard to put into words so sorry for the confusion, thanks for the help! 
I would read the text file in one line at a time into a temporary string array (space delimited). Then write to the class variables one index at a time. Assuming each line in your text file is a separate product.
When working with data always assume you are retrieving either a single value or multiple rows.
Oh oh oh, I see what you mean. That would involve storing variables for use later. In that case I'd recommend storing all numbers you calculate in an array. That way you can mix and match them for use later. You could even store the equations used to come up with each number in an alternate array (or a multidimensional array) so you can output the final equation at the end of the whole process.
Can you give an abstract example of the data you are looking up
Does there need to be multiple steps? Why not check all of the fields that you want to compare against in the beginning, and if the result count is less than 1, do the insert? Or, if this is something that you want the user to determine on a case-by-case basis, show a modal dialog with a DGV containing all of the possible matches and ask the user if one matches or if a new record needs to be created?
Sorry, the plan had been to allow the user to decide whether to Update or Replace, but I may just automate it all in one go.
If you post code, I can help you out more than just suggestions :]
So you are saying copy the code from the listbox that I have already created and replace the inputbox?
That isn't VB7... Looks like VBA to me.
instr()
Have you added the handler to the object you are expecting to call this subroutine to handle the click event? With Object Addhandler Object.Click, Addressof wfctrl12345_Click End With
Yeah it is there, it is automatically imported. I will take a look again. Its strange because sometimes after compiling, saving, distributing all handlers disappear, re-enter all of them, then all but 1 works and so on
You need to learn to set breakpoints and step through running code instead of guessing what might be wrong.
I changed it to a 2 almost immediately after I posted it, missing the little things lol
I updated that to reflect my data however it does not update - Dim r As DataRow = CustomerDatabaseDataSet.SALESREP.Rows(0) SalesRepFirstNameLabel1.Text = r("SalesRepFirstName").ToString SalesRepLastNameLabel1.Text = r("SalesRepLastName").ToString SalesRepRegionLabel1.Text = r("SalesRepRegion").ToString 
Is your query returning any rows?
its only returning the first sales reps info from the database.. and then if i change the sales rep number in the app, it stays on the first's info.
you need to keep track of what was selected and if the random picks one, generate another until it's one that's not been selected. Or, when one is selected, remove it from the list and reindex, then generate the next random from the new range.
- add possible numbers to a list - shuffle the list - go through the list sequentially
So I'm at a loss. I cannot figure out how to assign the text file to an array. Do I do this using a loop? This is confusing the shit out of me and it shouldn't be this difficult to comprehend. It's just reading lines from a file. I think I might be reading too much into it. 
Do you need to parse the data or is the data already formatted and you just need it saved as a CSV file? 
Below should work if you are using early binding. Let me know if you have issues. Dim oExcel As Application = New Application oExcel.Visible = False oExcel.DisplayAlerts = False Dim OriginalWorkbook As Workbook = oExcel.Workbooks.Open("Your File") Dim CSVWorkbook As Workbook = oExcel.Workbooks.Add For i = 1 To OriginalWorkbook.Worksheets.Count OriginalWorkbook.Worksheets(i).Copy(Before:=CSVWorkbook.Worksheets("Sheet1")) CSVWorkbook.SaveAs("Your Directory" &amp; OriginalWorkbook.Worksheets(i).Name, XlFileFormat.xlCSV) CSVWorkbook.Worksheets(1).Delete Next oExcel.Visible = True oExcel.DisplayAlerts = True oExcel.Quit()
2.0 is what's required, but i want to use 4.0 in case we add anything new. OS will be (rarely)Windows XP or Win7
Thanks Ron for your assistance. This has been scratching my head for a while. Let me elaborate further. At the beginning of this script, there are imports of VB, system.runtime.interop, system.collections, system.globalization, system.text, system.collections.generic, and vendor common files, vendor config files, vendor vb scripting. The namespace inherits the vb script base, and there are the "auto generated control" members. The FriendWithEvents has the declarative events (this does this, this button handles this, etc) assuming my understanding is correct here. So the handler if I am understanding this is automatically imported by the vendor's own code / scripting correct? wfctrl12345_Click is already in my "Auto Generated Control Members" Maybe this part of the vendor's custom code and part of their sdk? 
2.0 is installed in 7 with SP1, and 4.0 is installed as part of Windows Updates. We haven't had to add .NET 4.0 (or 4.5) to any Windows 7 machine ever. You shouldn't run into any issues with these versions on Windows 7 (other than 4.0 not being supported any more, but I believe that just applies to updates). With Windows XP, 4.0 is available from optional updates, after all service packs are installed. What version of Windows are you not seeing the framework installed on, or is it just that the installation isn't starting? Is it set to distribute with InstallShield, or just as a prerequisite? If it's just a prerequisite it will check for it, but not distribute / install it. I personally stopped distributing the framework when Vista came out, as we were always behind on versions due to updates and service packs. It also adds a lot of overhead to the installer. 
I've seen people also use a global boolean and flip it true at the end of the form load event handler. All the other events check that boolean and fail if it's false. That way, when you're still loading the form and it's setting the initial text, it might still raise textchanged but textchanged knows to ignore it. Another option is not handle the textchanged event in the designer at all (remove the "Handles ImageTextbox.TextChanged"). That way, it won't get raised when the form is building itself. You can attach it later (maybe during form.shown?) using "AddHandler ImageTextbox.TextChanged, AddressOf ImageTextbox_TextChanged"
What (if any) is the pre-existing formating for txt_StartDate.text and txt_StopDate.text?
batch file in task scheduler? ftp file to location run kron script if linux?
I'm surprised I didn't think of this. It's so simple. Thank you! 
Eh, this isn't too terrible. Shot in the foot for VB-only programmers, but nothing crazy as the two languages are similar. If something was needed urgently enough, creating stuff in C# wouldn't require a miracle.
What language is your class teaching, because you are posting in /r/visualbasic, with C# code.
That doesn't actually make any sense. Can you explain?
lol no problem. Maybe try /r/csharp for help. As a hint, you could make use of the random class. 
https://github.com/docevaad/Chain/wiki/A-Chain-Tutorial This is a tutorial for a project that I work on. So if you get stuck I can help you.
`query.First()`
the one with the highest score (not taking into account duplicate scores) is lstPlayers at Index 0
There are multiple ways. You can use datasets, LINQ2SQL, Entity Framework, or just manual SQL statements using Database Connection, Command, and DataReader objects. LINQ2SQL has more or less been superseded by Entity Framework. You will probably find EF to have a slight learning curve, but it does a lot of the back end stuff for you, and it is the recommended method by Microsoft for writing database connected applications.
I tried changing it to Dim query = From guy In players Order By guy.score Descending Select guy For Each guy In query lstPlayers.Items.Add(query.First()) Next That's not working, do you know what I'm doing wrong?
Thanks, I still can't seem to get it to work tho. I tried lstPlayers.Items.Add(guy(0).score) but I'm still getting an error.
 Dim rslt As Roster = (From b In players Order By b.score Descending Select b).First
I swear by [Entity Framework](http://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/). It was a little bit of a learning curve at first, but now I swear by it. I suggest focusing on the Code First models and avoid the EDMX method as that method will no longer be supported from EF7 onward.
I tried this and in my list box "WindowsApplication1.Form1+Roster" is showing up instead of the players name
You can try to use a while loop. While combBox1.checked = false btnNext.show=false End while btnNext.show = true. This is something you can try to use. It will loop forever until the combo box1 is selected. It will be in the main form of the program. If you have more then one combo box, you can use 'and' to try to link a flag variable, so that all loops stop when the flag changes to false. You would still use the same code but use While flag =false BtnNext.show = false End while. BtnNext.show =true. This assumes that you have a button to move onto the next stage of the program. I'm not 100% sure if this would work, but if it doesn't, Google is your best friend. Also sorry for bad formatting but I'm on mobile. 
Bunch of ways to do this, here is the easiest Dim datTim1 As Date = now() Dim datTim2 As Date = #7/4/1776# console.writeline("Days since Declaration of Independence was ratified:" &amp; DateDiff(DateInterval.Day, datTim1 , datTim2 )
 do while combobox1.text = "" ' should have some sort of thread sleep ' or similar here to free up resources loop dim myString as string = combobox1.text oh and let your teacher know this is retarded. it eats processing cycles like crazy. Nobody in the real world uses loops like this.
Well if he meant textbox, he probably meant something like this. Sub Main() Dim retText As String = "" Do While retText = "" Console.WriteLine("Please Enter a Word.") retText = Console.ReadLine() Loop Console.WriteLine("You entered " &amp; retText) Console.ReadKey() End Sub
I'm not really sure what you mean. If you declare a structure once, you can use it any number of times for any number of different scenarios. For instance, if I create the flight structure... Public Structure Flight Public Destination as String Public Plane as Integer Public Time As String Public Name As String Public Day As String End Structure I can then create an _instance_ of the structure like so: Dim AM830 as Flight AM830.Destination = "Honolulu" AM830.Plane = 747 ' and so on 
Thank you!!! this is exactly what i was asking
Also, to add onto the above structure, you could add the following to determine evolutionary paths/trees. Dim EvoTo() As Long Dim EvoFrom As Long These would be arrays that store the arbitrary array index of the related pokemon. You'd use an array here because I know certain pokemon can evolve into many different types, but each can only evolve from one other pokemon. So to look up this information, you could use Pokemon(Pokemon(0).EvoTo(0)).Name to look up the name of the pokemon another pokemon evolves into. (Or if that formatting is too confusing, you can use a function to return the name using the same code so things are more readable)
Class, not Structure. Using `Structure` correctly is not a beginner level skill.
If you want this to gain some traction then read the wiki and follow the post rules. You don't specifically mention the problem you are having. What have you tried? What code do you have right now? I'm not experienced, but I ask for help here and you get more hits if you follow the rules. 
Hi. First, be sure to import the Microsoft Office workspaces at the top of your module. Import Microsoft.Office.Core Import Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel Let's start by defining some variables. Dim ExcelAppObj As Application Dim ExcelBooksObj As Workbooks Dim ExcelBookObj As Workbook Dim ExcelSheetObj As Worksheet Instantiate the ExcelAppObj with either early binding or late binding. I prefer early binding, so the code editor can use intellisense. ExcelAppObj = New Application Now that we have an application variable, we can get the workbooks. Note we haven't opened a workbook yet, we're just instantiating a variable to the Excel application's Workbooks object. ExcelBooksObj = ExcelAppObj.Workbooks We can use this object to open a specific Workbook and assign it to our ExcelBookObj variable. Replace &lt;filename&gt; with the string containing the path to your Excel file. ExcelBookObj = ExcelBooksObj.Open(&lt;filename&gt;) This ExcelBookObj now contains all the sheets, so let's pick the first sheet. You can select a sheet by name or by index (starting with 1). ExcelSheetObj = ExcelBookObj.Worksheets(1) At this point, you can search to your heart's content. Dim stringVariable As String = "abcdef" If ExcelSheetObj.Range("A1").Value = stringVariable Then ' That's a match End If You probably want a loop like this: Dim rowNumber As Integer For rowNumber = 1 To 10 If ExcelSheetObj.Range("A" &amp; rowNumber).Value = stringVariable Then ' That's a match, so grab B, C, D, E, etc. from this row. End If Next
Thank you so much your a legend 
Let's say you have four textboxes named TextboxB, TextBoxC, TextBoxD and TextboxE (named B-E to correspond to the Excel column). Put the following within the If..Then where it says "That's a match". TextboxB.Text = ExcelSheetObj.Range("B" &amp; rowNumber).Value TextboxC.Text = ExcelSheetObj.Range("C" &amp; rowNumber).Value TextboxD.Text = ExcelSheetObj.Range("D" &amp; rowNumber).Value TextboxE.Text = ExcelSheetObj.Range("E" &amp; rowNumber).Value You might have to specify the form name before the textbox name. If your textboxes are on a form named "Main", you'd use: Main.TextboxB.Text = ExcelSheetObj.Range("B" &amp; rowNumber).Value ' and so on If you're using listboxes, you can assign them like this: ListboxB.Items.Add(ExcelSheetObj.Range("B" &amp; rowNumber).Value)
So you're trying to figure out how your program will figure out the next time that holiday will occur next year if the date has already been passed this year?
just a 2016 + 1 basically
This should show you how to add dates together fairly easily: Dim NewDate As Date NewDate = CDate(Now) MsgBox(NewDate) NewDate = DateAdd(DateInterval.Year, 1, NewDate) MsgBox(NewDate) Declares var NewDate, assigns it the value of Now (You can substitute that with your holiday's previous date) then it displays that value. It then adds a year onto it and displays it again so you can ensure it's been updated.
Some holidays don't follow that logic though. 
Well reading a text file is as easy as Dim contents as String = My.Computer.FileSystem.ReadAllText(Path); Writing is the same. My.Computer.FileSystem.WriteAllText(contents,Path,append); Flippnig positions would probably need a for loop on the contents string.
Ah cool! Didn't know about the methods in there. Makes things much easier!
Ask your instructor what they think about sql injection and parameterized queries
No. There is nothing in the OneDrive API that would allow you to manipulate documents stored there directly.
Hang on, let me get my crystal ball so I can tell what's wrong with the code that I can't see...
When you say "published", are we talking about ClickOnce publishing? The ClickOnce manifest has a separate icon attribute that gets used for the automatically generated shortcuts, and maybe that wasn't automatically updated when the icon was changed. It's also possible that the exe contains different icons for different resolutions, e.g. the new is only available for 16x16 and 32x32, but an 48x48 version of the old is still in there that gets used by the larger desktop items. I'm not sure how that could happen by accident, though.
These are all good questions. I will see what he says.
Thanks for the response. I've only been learning VB for a couple months so there's definitely some things I could clean up to make it less confusing. Also I had a listbox but I'm using the message box so I just commented that code out rather than actually removing it which might make things look more confusing. I think your function is doing something similar to what my code is. My code basically takes 6 random integers to find 6 players from the list but those 6 players need to have a projected score of 5x their salary/1000. So if a player's salary is 10,000 then his projected score needs to be at least 50 to possibly be in the final lineup. So my code finds 6 guys with at least 5x their value while the total salary among the 6 players is under 50,000. The problem is the way my code is I can end up with 6 guys who all meet value but they could all have fairly low salaries and I want my total to be as close to 50,000 as possible. Hopefully that clears the code up a little.
This is a simple error. Your icon cache for your desktop folder has the old icon. Try using ccleaner to clear your explorer cache
I can't see your code and I'm having trouble understanding exactly what you are trying to do. on the strings in select case things.. umn, Dim test as string = "wow select case Test case "wow" msgbox("umn, wow") case "runescape" msgbox("ok") case "blizzard" msgbox("no") end select maybe you need a simple function? private function getKey(byval inputKey as string) as integer select case inputKey case "W" return 0 case "S" return 1 end function Just some things off the top of my head. 
Since this is a game of pong, using something as simple as GetAsyncKeyState would work for your situation. Imports System.Runtime.InteropServices Public Class Form1 &lt;DllImport("user32.dll")&gt; _ Shared Function GetAsyncKeyState(ByVal vKey As System.Windows.Forms.Keys) As Short End Function Private Sub Timer_Hotkey_Tick(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Timer_Hotkey.Tick If GetAsyncKeyState(Keys.Return) &lt;&gt; 0 Then Me.Text = "Enter pressed now" Else Me.Text = "Enter not pressed now" End If End Sub End Class 
At a quick glance, you seem to be saving the **.Image** from your buttons, you probably want to save **PictureBox1.Image** instead...
To add to what has been commented in here, you can create an array of your structure to allow for easier management of large amounts of data. Dim Flight(99) As AM830 Would create an array with each index containing the variables initialized in your Structure.
I figured that much but without seeing your code, I don't know how you are trying to go about it and what problems you are running into.
With all the methods that VB works with Excel docs, this is not possible without editing the file at a binary level. (There's a bit more limitations with that as well, but those are outstanding circumstances). For regular operations, you would still have to open up the document in an excel instance, whether that is contained within your VB application, or launching excel to do so.
Yes, I have.
Try and throw an application.doevents call in after you make the images visible and see if that helps. 
Since you are asking for a 9 digit number I assume this is Canadian. Imports System.Text.RegularExpressions Module Module1 Sub Main() Dim regex As Regex = New Regex("^(\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{3})|(\d{9})$") Console.Write("Please enter a SIN number: ") Dim textToCheck As String = Console.ReadLine() Dim match As Match = regex.Match(textToCheck) If match.Success Then Console.WriteLine("Valid SIN number") Else Console.WriteLine(match.Value &amp; " Is not valid") End If Console.ReadKey() End Sub End Module if you want an American one the RegEx expression is ^\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}$ Doing this the way you are doing it is insane. Must be school work...
Okay, thanks! I'll try this! And yes I am a Canadian doing this for school work.
Gotta be. Lazy assholes can't be bothered to do their own work. 
It appears you have a logic issue, building in an accidental fail safe switch in there. You're declaring Skip = 1 if anything in any of the checks goes wrong, resulting in the file being marked for deletion. What you want to do in this situation, is to add one to Skip, so if Skip is equal to 8, which is the number of times you compare values for Skip, then you will know, everything failed, and to mark the file for deletion.
My guess is that `Range("A5:A60")` has multiple values because it is multiple cells, so a collection of strings can't be tested against a single String using `=`. You could try something like: If ExcelSheetObj.Range("A5:A60").Where(Function(r) r.Value = stringVariable).Count &gt; 0 Then or maybe If ExcelSheetObj.Range("A5:A60").Where(Function(r) r.Value.Contains(stringVariable)).Count &gt; 0 Then (I'm not entirely sure if you can use `.Where` against a `Range` without testing in the IDE, but it's where I would start...)
If you want to wait for a form to be closed before continuing, make sure you show it modally. Sounds like you have a sub that creates and displays all the forms at once.
When I am in the "real world" as you put it I won't be doing programming, it's on the module but it's not for me. I do this course for other aspects of IT which I can do. Wouldn't take a job that entails programming as it's of no interest to me personally.
I'm not much on visual basic but I think you just need 2 equal signs (==) to compare variables, not just one. Edit: I'm getting downvoted but the error states you cannot set that object you mean to be testing to a string. The if statement is completely invalid because it actually is written to say this; If (set X equal to 2) Do this. Which makes no since. 
VB does not use `==` for anything. I'm fairly certain the issue is because the Range object has multiple values and you can't compare test single String for equity against a Range with several different values. The error doesn't mention setting the value, it just says it can't convert the Range object to String type for comparison. In a way, it's like comparing an array or enumerable against a single String. One of the individual items may match, but a `String()` can't be compared to a `String` using the `=` operator.
Gotcha. Thanks for taking the time to explain. I'm not a fan of unexplained downvotes. 
Your one worked perfectly thank you very much 
You shouldn't declare your Doubles at class level, do it in the function instead. Change Val() to CInt(), and remove all the call statements; when you do lblTotal.text = totaldollars() This automatically calls the function and puts it in the text. All your other calls are superfluous. 
Have you gone line by line with a breakpoint to check if your code is properly identifying each line of the files in question?
Put your `dbTran` in its own using block and it will automatically roll back if there is an error. *** I usually put the try-catch at the very top level, as I usually have multiple using blocks.
Alright thanks everyone for replying I completely forgot that I made this post so I will look at it when I get home.
Change to For Each itm in WeaponsListBox.SelectedItems Listboxes store each item in them as a base object type, not specifically a string. ToString() is called on the object for on screen display purposes, but the actual items are objects not strings. That said, you never even use your itm variable in your for next loop, so you don't need to cast it to anything. 
This is somewhat working. I have about 150 items in the list box, but no matter what selection the user makes, it continues to use Unarmed Strike. EDIT1: Also, it did use the itm variable before, but after so much editing, i was trying to fix it and I suppose I lost track of where I was going with it. xD Thanks for pointing that out. I removed the For/Next statement and am now running this: Dim lbl As New Label lbl.DataBindings.Add(New Binding("Text", _Weapons, "Name")) lbl.Size = New Size(NewCharacterForm.WeaponsFlowLayoutPanel.Width / 2, 13) lbl.Name = WeaponsListBox.SelectedValue &amp; "Label" lbl.ForeColor = System.Drawing.Color.Black() lbl.BackColor = System.Drawing.Color.Beige() lbl.Font = New Font("Times New Roman", 8) NewCharacterForm.WeaponsFlowLayoutPanel.Controls.Add(lbl) If WeaponsListBox.Focus = False Then lbl.Hide() End If
What data type is _Weapons? Is it some collection/array/list object? If so, is "Unarmed Strike" the first selection in this collection/array/list?
Yes it is a collection list. _Weapons is a class. I believe unarmed strike is the first in the code, but is not the first within the list box with the application running. I would give you a definitive answer, but the program is on my work desktop &amp; I will have my first day off tomorrow in 2 months. But I'm 100% positive that is the first weapon in the coding. 
How about val() function?
This may be a super old method but I always used to is IsNumeric to test the input from textboxes. Dim min As Double If IsNumeric(txtMinSalary.Text) then min = CDbl(txtMinSalary.text) End If Something like that worked for me to avoid invalid inputs. Also you could move the validation before the declaration and then do a second validation to determine if min&lt;max. (Edited to fix some grammar errors.)
Here you go: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb975644(v=xnagamestudio.31).aspx
It is also a popular demo project for game programming. If you look hard, you can find it in most languages.
What method are you using to access the file?
 If rdbSinglePhase.Checked Then ElseIf rdbThreePhase.Checked Then End If
Thanks ViperSRT3g. Much appreciated.
Well, whenever I try to use the selected item, I receive the InvalidCastException. I have the weapons in a BindingList because it was easier for me to input all the information into the bindinglist that way. The label's text property will have the variable of user choice on whichever weapon the user decides to use. 
See those tabs on the right of VS?
Yes, I've been playing with that class view tab, but my book mentions "class name kissy" and "method list" that I can't find anywhere.
By how many times the program is ran, do you mean literally the amount of times the program has been started on the computer? Or how many times it runs the code you posted? Because currently, there are no loops, so your code would only run once, and terminate.
I am working on the loop right now. I have it said up where it will run and display the totals. Once the users hit the clear button it clears the form for to be used again. I need to be able to keep track of and display how many times it is ran before exiting the program.
Muchhh appreciated my man.
go for VB6, is the best of the best there is
Well, the `Checked` property returns either `True` or `False`, not a string corresponding to an ESRB rating. Obviously you can't compare the two. You need to do two things: check if the game'srating is a specific rating *and* that the checkbox for that rating is checked, and repeat that for every possible rating. Doing that in a LINQ statement would get pretty ugly, so I'd do this instead: Dim checkedRatings = New HashSet(Of String) If chkE.Checked Then checkedRatings.Add("E") ' If chkE10.Checked Then ... And in the query From game In ... Where checkedRatings.Contains(game.Rating) ...
&gt; If chkE.Checked Then checkedRatings.Add("E") Hey, you're right! That is ugly, but hell, it works. Gracias
I recommend looking into Structures and Arrays for managing your data. Either one would do wonders for your code in this application.
[This](http://www.dotnetperls.com/random-vbnet) should help. If it doesn't, you'll need to be more specific about the problem you're having.
Assuming you're using buttons to represent your grid squares, create a 2D array for the grid of buttons like so: Dim grid(,) as Button Then programatically add the buttons to the form: For x = 0 to 10 'replace 10 with whatever your max X is For y = 0 to 10 'same as above Dim button as New Button button.Width = 20 button.Height = 20 button.Position = (x * button.Width, y * button.Height) Form1.Controls.Add(button) Next Next 
Its been years since I've touched VB6, but I'd lazily do something like Random = Int((Rnd * 3) + 1) Textbox &amp; Random &amp; .text = "text"
_Weapons.ResetBindings (false), maybe?
I'll try this in the morning. Where would I place this code? 
DOOT DOOT
There's no "one right answer"... you can represent the game in many ways. But since Battleship is played on a grid, it's easy to think about and to represent if you use a 2-dimensional array. Let me explain how I would do it. First, I want an array to represent my Battleship grid: Dim grid(9, 9) As String ' From 0 to 9 so 10x10 grid. Now, I don't like hardcoding values like 9 or 10 everywhere in my code; also, what if I decide that I want a 12x12 or 20x20 grid? I prefer to plan ahead an make all my code use constants that are easy to change. So, let's create a constant for the gridsize and let's also initialize the grid with something that means "empty" or "water"... Dim gridSize = 10, water = ".." ' the grid Dim grid(gridSize - 1, gridSize - 1) As String ' 0..9 so 10x10 grid For x = 0 To gridSize - 1 For y = 0 To gridSize - 1 grid(x, y) = water Next Next Now I'm using a string grid, but it could be integers (water could be 0, and ships would be 1, 2, 3, 4...) I'm just using strings because I'll be using two letter codes for the boats. As I work, I want to see what my grid looks like, it makes it easier to spot bugs. Let's add a small routine that prints the grid: Sub PrintGrid(grid(,) As String) For x = 0 To grid.GetUpperBound(0) For y = 0 To grid.GetUpperBound(1) Console.Write(grid(x, y) &amp; " ") Next Console.WriteLine Next End Sub Of course, this requires a console to work and if you're in a "Windows Forms" project, you don't have one provided automatically. You could put a textbox with a fixed-width font and send the output there. Personally, I'm using [LINQPad](https://www.linqpad.net/) because it has a wonderful ".Dump" method that makes it super easy to see objects, arrays, lists, etc. Here's what the PrintGrid method shows right now: .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. With LINQPad, here's what grid.Dump gives me: [grid.Dump](http://imgur.com/aCfBAe7) Ok, enough with the empty grid, let's place some ships. For the ships, we'll have a two-letter code for the grid. We'll probably want the full name of the ship to show the user at some point. The ships also have a length to indicate how many squares they use on the grid. So, to hold all those various bits of info in a tidy package, I'd create a Ship class: Class Ship Property Code As String Property Name As String Property Length As Integer End Class We might need to add more properties later, but for now, we have what we need. Let's create some ships. Oh, we'll need something to hold all the ships; I'll use a list. It could be a 1-dimensional array, but lists are generally easier to work with. Here goes: Dim Ships = New List(Of Ship) Ships.Add(New ship With {.Code = "AC", .Name = "Aircraft Carrier", .Length = 5}) Ships.Add(New ship With {.Code = "BS", .Name = "Battleship", .Length = 4}) Ships.Add(New ship With {.Code = "DE", .Name = "Destroyer", .Length = 3}) Ships.Add(New ship With {.Code = "SM", .Name = "Submarine", .Length = 3}) Ships.Add(New ship With {.Code = "PB", .Name = "Patrol Boat", .Length = 2}) Ok, now we have an empty grid an 5 ships to place into it. We'll need some random numbers, so we'll stick this somewhere: Dim rnd = New Random To place the ships, we'll go over each one and try to find a random unoccupied spot to place it. The basic loop will look like this: ' Place the ships into the grid For Each ship In ships Dim shipPlaced = False Do ' find a free spot Loop Until shipPlaced Next To find a free spot, we pick a position in the grid, and check if it's empty: ' pick a random spot Dim x = rnd.Next(0, gridSize) Dim y = rnd.Next(0, gridSize) If grid(x, y) = water Then ' spot is free, check if ship can be placed there... End If (Oops, I have to go now, small emergency, I'll complete this later...) 
Listbox.selecteditemchanged event.
thank you very much
Ok, I'm back. Where were we? Ah yes, we're placing our ships randomly in our grid. We need to do 2 things: check if enough adjacent positions are empty to place the whole ship and, if so, actually put the ship in the grid. The way I'll do it is to generate a list of positions, then check if all those positions are free in the grid and if they are, actually put the ship's "code" in the grid. Positions are just two integer: X and Y. We could use various means to hold those values, but I'll just make a small Position class to do it: Class Position Property X As Integer Property Y As Integer Sub New(x As Integer, y As Integer) _x = x _y = y End Sub End Class We'll create a list to hold as many positions are the ship is long: Dim positions = New List(Of Position) Now we need to start from our randomly picked position, and check to see if we can fit the ship either horizontally or vertically. We'll pick an orientation at random and see if we can use those positions: Select Case rnd.Next(2) ' 0 or 1 - vertical or horizontal Case 0 ' vertical If y + (ship.Length - 1) &lt; gridSize Then For yy = y To y + (ship.Length - 1) positions.Add(New Position(x, yy)) Next End If Case 1 ' horizontal If x + (ship.Length - 1) &lt; gridSize Then For xx = x To x + (ship.Length - 1) positions.Add(New Position(xx, y)) Next End If End Select Ok, there's a lot going on here, so let's break it down. We "Select Case rnd.Next(2)" to get a random 0 or 1. (System.Random return a random integer between 0 and 1 less than it's argument...) Once we have that, we do either Case 0 or Case 1. Both are the same logic, but one operates on the X axis and the other on the Y. We first check if our random (x,y) + the ship length will fit on the grid. It's useless to generate positions that are outside the grid, we'll just crash with an "Index out of bounds" error anyway. If we fit, we then generate positions starting from our random one and adding others until we have enough to cover then length of the ship. For example, if we picked (4,4) randomly and are placing the aircraft carrier horizontally, we'll end up with (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7, 4) and (8,4) in our list of positions. Note that it's possible to exit the "Select Case" with an empty list (if the ship didn't fit), so we'll need to check that too. Now, we have either an empty list or a list of positions; if we have positions, we need to make sure they are all empty right now and if so, put the ship on the grid. If positions.count &gt; 0 Then ' Check if grid is free at those positions Dim free = True For Each pos In positions If grid(pos.X, pos.Y) &lt;&gt; water Then free = False Exit For End If Next If free Then ' Grid is free there, place the ship For Each pos In positions grid(pos.X, pos.Y) = ship.Code Next shipPlaced = True End If End If So we check positions.Count to make sure we have positions to work with. If we do, we loop through those positions and check if the grid is empty (= water) at those positions. If so, the "free" variable will be True when we get to the final check and we'll then loop again through the positions, this time putting the ship's code in the grid (that will mark it "occupied") and telling our "Do Loop" that we are done by setting shipPlaced = True. Here are a few examples of filled in grids: .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. SM .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. SM AC .. .. .. .. .. PB PB .. SM AC .. .. .. .. .. .. BS .. .. AC .. .. .. .. .. .. BS .. .. AC .. .. .. .. .. .. BS .. DE AC .. .. .. .. .. .. BS .. DE .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

All that's left to do is to represent it on the form. It's better to separate the logic and representation of the game from the user interface. It makes it easier to create, test, fix, etc. and you can more easily reuse the logic if you decide to do a web interface or use WPF instead of WinForms. Hope that helps a bit.

VBS and VB.net are effectively 2 different languages. they do share some basic syntax and a few intrinsic functions are similar, but so do Java and PHP. vb.net is event based, so don't need a for loop. instead, you'd have a button that when clicked handles the IFs and saving, and at the end clears the box. you could also do it from a keypress event on the box handing it when the Enter key is pressed. the combo box is an odd thing, but you only need to keep a module level variable to track how many where entered and stop when it matches the box's value. you should probably start with a vb2015 tutorial. that should cover forms, text boxes, buttons, and some basics about events.
Could you point me to one that would show me what I need to do in a quick fashion? A tutorial that doesn't tell me the story behind VB or who made it or the name of that person's mother.
Hey thanks for the gold... sorry for the delay, my week is very busy. To link it for the form, again, there are many ways to do it. You were trying to do it with a grid of buttons if I'm not mistaken, so here's a short example of creating a grid of buttons and getting information when they're clicked on: Public Class Form1 Private gridSize As Integer = 10 ' the same variable as in our previous example... Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click ' New game Dim btnSize = 30 ' The size (width and height) of each button If Me.Controls.Count = 1 Then ' Controls.count is the number of controls on the form... ' Create our button grid For x = 0 To gridSize - 1 For y = 0 To gridSize - 1 Dim btn = New Button() ' Create a new button btn.Width = btnSize ' set it's size btn.Height = btnSize btn.Left = btnSize + x * btn.Width ' set it's position btn.Top = btnSize + y * btn.Height btn.Tag = New Position(x, y) ' we want to know which position the button works for btn.Visible = True ' make sure we can see it AddHandler btn.Click, AddressOf ButtonHandler ' when we click the button, we want this Sub to be called Me.Controls.Add(btn) ' Add the button to the form Next Next End If End Sub Private Sub ButtonHandler(sender As Button, e As EventArgs) Dim position = CType(sender.Tag, Position) ' Get the .Tag of the button and "cast it" (ie, tell VB that the object is actually a Position) MsgBox("Hello from button at " &amp; position.X &amp; ", " &amp; position.Y) ' do something with the information End Sub End Class If you create an empty project with a single form "Form1" and add 1 button "Button1" to it and paste that code, you should see a 10x10 grid appear when you click Button1. The important part is the ButtonHandler Sub. Here, we can know which of the 100 buttons was clicked without having to do one hundred "if ... then"... Instead of a MsgBox, you can check the grid you created with the previous code and change the text and color of the button to show "miss" or "hit" (in any which way you want to show it to the user) The "magic" part (and I don't know if you've been shown this in class) is where we "AddHandler &lt;event&gt;, AddressOf &lt;sub&gt;"; this let's us re-use the same handler for any number of buttons, saving a metric fuckton of code. It's basically telling VB "when I click this new button I just created, I want you to call this sub and pass me the button and events. If you've created your game grid previously, you should be able to use the position you get from the button to check the grid and react accordingly. Let me know if something is still not clear...
Do you speak german by any chance? http://openbook.rheinwerk-verlag.de/einstieg_vb_2012/
Ah okay. Was worth a try. Sorry man, its been several years for me since i learned it so i dont remember any other tutorials. 
But maybe [this](http://www.dotnetperls.com/textbox-vbnet) helps with your problem
Thank you very much for typing this all out for me, you've helped with my coursework and potentially my future. Thanks again! 
Yes, "Position" is our "Class Position" which you need to define somewhere. You can right-click on the project and "Add Class..." and paste the code in the resulting file. The rest of the code can be put in a Module and made public, so that the form can call the Sub to place the ships and reference the 10x10 grid... these are things that I was hoping you would have had covered in class... 
Note: This has no error checking, it does exactly as you stated. Option Explicit Private Sub Test() Select Case Random(1, 3) Case 1 Text3.Text = CInt(Text1.Text) * CInt(Text2.Text) Case 2 Text4.Text = CInt(Text1.Text) * CInt(Text2.Text) Case 3 Text5.Text = CInt(Text1.Text) * CInt(Text2.Text) End Select End Sub Public Function Random(Lowerbound As Integer, Upperbound As Integer) As Integer Randomize Random = Int(Rnd * Upperbound) + Lowerbound End Function 
Here's a quick example with our ship placing code integrated in the form and a bit more logic in the buttonHandler... Public Class Form1 Private gridSize As Integer = 10 Private water As String = ".." Private grid(gridSize - 1, gridSize - 1) As String ' 0..9 so 10x10 grid Private Ships As List(Of Ship) = New List(Of Ship) Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click ' New game Dim btnSize = 30 ' The size (width and height) of each button If Me.Controls.Count = 1 Then ' Controls.count is the number of controls on the form... NewGame() ' init the grid ' Create our button grid For x = 0 To gridSize - 1 For y = 0 To gridSize - 1 Dim btn = New Button() ' Create a new button btn.Width = btnSize ' set it's size btn.Height = btnSize btn.Left = btnSize + x * btn.Width ' set it's position btn.Top = btnSize + y * btn.Height btn.Tag = New Position(x, y) ' we want to know which position the button works for btn.BackColor = Color.Blue btn.Visible = True ' make sure we can see it AddHandler btn.Click, AddressOf ButtonHandler ' when we click the button, we want this Sub to be called Me.Controls.Add(btn) ' Add the button to the form Next Next End If End Sub Private Sub ButtonHandler(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Dim button = CType(sender, Button) Dim position = CType(button.Tag, Position) ' Get the .Tag of the button and "cast it" (ie, tell VB that the object is actually a Position) 'MsgBox("Hello from button at " &amp; position.X &amp; ", " &amp; position.Y) ' do something with the information If button.BackColor &lt;&gt; Color.Blue Then MsgBox("You already tried that position...") Exit Sub End If Select Case grid(position.X, position.Y) Case ".." ' miss button.BackColor = Color.LightBlue Case Else ' ship was hit button.BackColor = Color.Red ' find out what kind of ship was hit For Each ship In Ships If ship.Code = grid(position.X, position.Y) Then Me.Text = "You hit the " &amp; ship.Name &amp; "!" ' you can add counters here... Exit For End If Next End Select End Sub Private Sub NewGame() 'Dim gridSize = 10, water = ".." Dim water = ".." ' the grid 'Dim grid(gridSize - 1, gridSize - 1) As String ' 0..9 so 10x10 grid For x = 0 To gridSize - 1 For y = 0 To gridSize - 1 grid(x, y) = water Next Next ' the ships - create largests first, placement will be easier 'Dim Ships = New List(Of Ship) Ships.Add(New Ship With {.Code = "AC", .Name = "Aircraft Carrier", .Length = 5}) Ships.Add(New Ship With {.Code = "BS", .Name = "Battleship", .Length = 4}) Ships.Add(New Ship With {.Code = "DE", .Name = "Destroyer", .Length = 3}) Ships.Add(New Ship With {.Code = "SM", .Name = "Submarine", .Length = 3}) Ships.Add(New Ship With {.Code = "PB", .Name = "Patrol Boat", .Length = 2}) Dim rnd = New Random ' Place the ships into the grid For Each ship In Ships Dim shipPlaced = False Do ' pick a random spot Dim x = rnd.Next(0, gridSize) Dim y = rnd.Next(0, gridSize) If grid(x, y) = water Then ' spot is free, check if ship can be placed there... Dim positions = New List(Of Position) Select Case rnd.Next(2) ' 0 or 1 - vertical or horizontal Case 0 ' vertical If y + (ship.Length - 1) &lt; gridSize Then For yy = y To y + (ship.Length - 1) positions.Add(New Position(x, yy)) Next End If Case 1 ' horizontal If x + (ship.Length - 1) &lt; gridSize Then For xx = x To x + (ship.Length - 1) positions.Add(New Position(xx, y)) Next End If End Select If positions.Count &gt; 0 Then ' Check if grid is free at those positions Dim free = True For Each pos In positions If grid(pos.X, pos.Y) &lt;&gt; water Then free = False Exit For End If Next If free Then ' Grid is free there, place the ship For Each pos In positions grid(pos.X, pos.Y) = ship.Code Next shipPlaced = True End If End If End If Loop Until shipPlaced Next PrintGrid(grid) End Sub Sub PrintGrid(grid(,) As String) For x = 0 To grid.GetUpperBound(0) Console.Write(" ") For y = 0 To grid.GetUpperBound(1) Console.Write(grid(x, y) &amp; " ") Next Console.WriteLine() Next End Sub End Class Class Position Property X As Integer Property Y As Integer Sub New(x As Integer, y As Integer) _X = x _Y = y End Sub End Class Class Ship Property Code As String Property Name As String Property Length As Integer End Class I put everything in the form to make it easier to paste in as an example, but the code could be better organized. All that's missing now are the hit counters and a check for the "end of game" condition. And, of course, a real Battleship game would have you place your ships and have the computer take shots too. 
Okay, so I fixed that, but the issue still remains with the values of the object properties still not changing by the function
You generally don't want to individually create objects like this: Public BlueJays As New team Instead, what you'll want to do is something more like this: Private teamNames as New List of String From {"Cubs", "Cardinals", ..., "Rangers"} Private teams as New List of team For Each teamName in teamNames Dim team as New team team.name = teamName teams.add(team) Next You'll then want to write a function that retrieves the teams based on the name: Public Function getTeam(name as String) For Each team in teams If team.name = name then return team Next Return nothing End Function And in your button_click event, you can do this: baseball.GameSim(getTeam("Cardinals"), getTeam("Pirates")) Moving on, I'm not 100% sure how baseball works, but the logic in GameSim() seems a little strange. If I'm not wrong, you're trying to roll a score for each team from 0 to 19? If so, why not just do this? The math.floor command is just being performed on 20-1 which is equals to 19 anyway. score1 = CInt(Rnd * 19) After that, you want to compare scores to see who wins, and then increase the winning team's win by 1 and the losing team's loss by 1. That's fine. The reason why it's not being updated is because you're referencing the arguments x and y byval instead of byref. All you have to is change this... Public Sub GameSim(ByVal x As team, ByVal y As team) To this... Public Sub GameSim(ByRef x As team, ByRef y As team)
When it goes through, is Puck.Bounds.IntersectsWith(Player1.Bounds) still returning true?
That might be what's happening, but I don't know why one is doing it and the other isn't
I'd be curious to see your final version. If you could push it to Github or some other web repo...
objSMBIOS.SerialNumber *is* a string, and is being concatenated right there, just like any other string. 
Strange, I don't know why it didn't work. What did work for me was this: compSN = objSMBIOS.SerialNumber Then later my MsgBox calls *compSN* without any trouble. 
what code wasn't working?
Correct - already elevated from running as admin. It's a cyber cafe mgmt software, so it does what normally looks pretty shady, but isn't in this case (server/admin/client). I can run proc's as admin, which normally seems nice, but this case I don't want to -- every time I try to run a certain app, it'll warn the client (supposed to be silent) "Heyy you are in admin some features may break etc etc &lt;OK&gt; &lt;CANCEL&gt;" Trying to launch FROM elevated app ... NONelevated :)
The easiest way is to use WinForms' databinding features. Here's an example using some of your code: Create a new project, add two forms - Form1 and Form2; add one button (Button1) to Form1 and a DataGridView (DataGridView1) to Form2. Form2 has no other code; this is the code for Form1: Public Class Form1 Private ProductTable As New DataTable() Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Using f = New Form2 f.DataGridView1.DataSource = ProductTable f.ShowDialog() End Using End Sub Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load Dim dtDescription = New DataColumn("Description", GetType(String)) Dim dtiId = New DataColumn("Product ID", GetType(String)) Dim dtQuantity = New DataColumn("Quantity", GetType(Decimal)) Dim dtWeight = New DataColumn("Unit Weight", GetType(Decimal)) Dim dtPrice = New DataColumn("Unit Price", GetType(Decimal)) ProductTable.Columns.Add(dtDescription) ProductTable.Columns.Add(dtiId) ProductTable.Columns.Add(dtQuantity) ProductTable.Columns.Add(dtWeight) ProductTable.Columns.Add(dtPrice) ProductTable.Rows.Add({"Super widget", 1, 10, 20, 3.99}) ProductTable.Rows.Add({"Mega thingamagig", 2, 20, 25, 82.49}) ProductTable.Rows.Add({"Extra cool thing", 3, 15, 44, 73.95}) ProductTable.Rows.Add({"Regular ordinary crap", 4, 12, 45, 13.99}) End Sub End Class Run this, and clicking the button will show the DataTable in the grid on Form2. 
Alright I'll try that and see if it works, thanks
use the mid() function...
That looks like C# code and I'm not even sure that XNA (or Monogame) work with Visual Basic.NET. 
XNA 4 works with VB. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh477142.aspx 
It looks like MonoGame might work with VB.NET too. http://community.monogame.net/t/monogame-template-vbnet-for-windows-desktop-directx/1213 
So, /u/grauenwolf pointed out a tutorial for creating games with XNA and it works with VB.NET, which he also pointed out. Here is some sample C# code that handles basic movement. https://gist.github.com/SeppyB/6933301

I just added the actual user control class in vb. I create the "form" and then add that item to my main form. But I think I just found the solution, which is to declare the usercontrol as a new usercontrol Dim Test as new usercontrol1 I am going to test this out and see if it work. Thanks for your help so far!!
Someone else could probably chime in for more dedicated projects, but basic HTML will get you a working website. Throw in some CSS to make it look pretty and you are good to go. Javascript and JQuery will give you additional functionality as will PHP or ASP.
As already pointed out, you'll need HTML and CSS knowledge at a minimum. Once you have the basics of those sorted out, you can do more advanced things by adding code to the site. There are a number of platforms and languages that can be used to build web sites, including PHP, Ruby, Java, and ASP.NET (to name a few). If using Visual Studio is your goal, then you'll be working with ASP.NET. I'd start by learning MVC: http://www.asp.net/mvc 
&gt; First thing is to realize that VBA and VB.NET are two different things, and can't be mixed inside of Visual Studio. VBA is written inside of an Office Application (Word, Excel, Outlook, etc), and can't be compiled to an executable. Sorry, as I said, rusty and never super-great to begin with. Corrected the OP. &gt; For # 1 ... I'd avoid doing that level of Interop, or messing with a VBA / Office solution like this in a .NET app if at all possible. For portability you can use SQL LocalDB for development. I'd probably opt for Entity Framework, and let it build out the LocalDB solution. Thanks for the tip on SQL LocalDB - I'll have to look into it more, but on the face of it seems like a much better idea, I was just trying to avoid a full scale SQL DB so I can get this up and moving quickly. The last big thing I made was heavily SQL dependent, and I didn't want to have to go through all that again for a quick proof of concept. &gt; For #2 ... For a "once every 5 minute" poll, a timer based solution is probably more viable. The FileSystemWatcher will fire events immediately for each change to the file, so it would probably be overkill. The BIDP isn't part of .NET, so doesn't really apply here. The IO.xxx namespace (or My.Computer.FileSystem) has lots of helpers to work with files, including FileInfo that will get you the various properties of the file, including last save / creation time, etc. Look into My.Computer.FileSystem.GetFileInfo So rather than using the dedicated FSW, just set up a Sub() with a timer and use either IO or My.Computer.FS namespace? I didn't realize FSW was an immediate trigger, I thought it could be used just to report back changes, then move from there, but your way appears to eliminate FSW, without any real additional steps (unless I'm missing something else) - so, thanks &gt; For #3, That's it. At least I had something right, lol.
It resets the registry key controlling Windows' maximum password age to the default of 30 days if it's set to either 1 or 999999 days, and then deletes itself. Presumably some sort of quick fix some IT guy created to deal with messed up password age settings on the school's computers, nothing malicious about it.
It really, really depends on what you want the website to actually be and do. That would localize what your best options would be. You may want to start with a framework like wordpress or drupal that takes a lot of the coding out of your hands, or you may want something more complex and direct like Visual Studio. Also web designer and web developer are two different things. Designers work on the front end/UI, while the developers generally work on the server side processing and clientside javascript. You can definitely be both, but again it all comes back to what your site's goals are.
Wouldn't the timer then need a BGW of its own to trigger from at regular intervals, to call up the main BGW?
I think the problem may be here: If Not lstCurves.SelectedItems.Count = 1 Then Exit Sub If nothing is displaying in the other two listboxes, and no errors are occurring, the code to fill those listboxes is probably not executing. This can be confirmed by adding a MessageBox.Show("Choose a message to display") after the statement above. If the messagebox doesn't display, then the statement above is forcing the sub procedure to exit. You may just need an EndIf after the Exit Sub.
Agreed! So the way to do this with tabcontrols is to place one set of controls on the form and put a tab control behind it. Then make it so when the tab page is changed it throws the info into variables. Does that sound correct? 
You may want to see if VB has SQLite support. I'm mainly Python-based, but SQLite is a pretty good solution for demo/prototyping DB stuff without having to set up a full DB.
Mmm, that could work if you create the controls for each tabpage only at runtime. Link it to the tabcontrol's tabchanged event, then call it once during form load. Basically, at design time you'll see no controls; only during runtime do the controls get created and populated with data. Still, it's not ideal because you still got to create the tabpages, which is in and of itself a control. Also, creating and destroying controls is expensive in terms of CPU resources, but still ultimately more efficient than mass creating them at design time.
Basically all you need is a for loop: For i As Integer = 0 To inputString.Length - 1 total += Asc(inputString.Substring(i, 1)) Next i
Formatted for readability: Public Class Form1 'variables Dim decmeds As Decimal Dim decsurgical As Decimal Dim declab As Decimal Dim decphys As Decimal Dim intdays As Integer 'final results Private decstaycharges As Decimal Private decmisc As Decimal 'for misc charges Private total As Decimal ' final results Function validateinputfields() As Boolean If Not Decimal.TryParse(txtdays.Text, intdays) Then MessageBox.Show("Input must be numeric") lbltotal.Text = ("error") ElseIf intdays &lt; 0 Then MessageBox.Show("must be a postive number") lbltotal.Text = ("error") Try Catch ex As Exception MessageBox.Show("Input must be numeric") lbltotal.Text = ("error") End Try End If Return False ' If Not Decimal.TryParse(txtmeds.Text, decmeds) Then MessageBox.Show("Input must be numeric") lbltotal.Text = ("error") ElseIf decmeds &lt; 0 Then MessageBox.Show("must be a postive number") lbltotal.Text = ("error") Try Catch ex As Exception MessageBox.Show("Input must be numeric") lbltotal.Text = ("error") End Try End If Return False If Not Decimal.TryParse(txtsurgicalcharge.Text, decsurgical) Then MessageBox.Show("Input must be numeric") lbltotal.Text = ("error") ElseIf decsurgical &lt; 0 Then MessageBox.Show("must be a postive number") lbltotal.Text = ("error") Try Catch ex As Exception MessageBox.Show("Input must be numeric") lbltotal.Text = ("error") End Try End If Return False If Not Decimal.TryParse(txtlab.Text, declab) Then MessageBox.Show("Input must be numeric") lbltotal.Text = ("error") ElseIf declab &lt; 0 Then MessageBox.Show("must be a postive number") lbltotal.Text = ("error") Try Catch ex As Exception MessageBox.Show("Input must be numeric") lbltotal.Text = ("error") End Try End If Return False If Not Decimal.TryParse(txtphys.Text, decphys) Then MessageBox.Show("Input must be numeric") lbltotal.Text = ("error") ElseIf decphys &lt; 0 Then MessageBox.Show("must be a postive number") lbltotal.Text = ("error") Try Catch ex As Exception MessageBox.Show("Input must be numeric") lbltotal.Text = ("error") End Try End If Return True End Function Function calcstaycharges(ByVal txtdays As String) As Decimal decstaycharges = intdays * 350 Return decstaycharges End Function Function calcmisccharges(ByVal txtMeds As Decimal, ByVal txtsurgicalcharge As Decimal, ByVal txtLab As Decimal, ByVal txtPhys As Decimal) As Decimal decmisc = decmeds + decsurgical + declab + decphys Return decmisc End Function Function calctotalcharges(ByVal decstaycharges As Decimal, ByVal decmisc As Decimal) As Decimal total = (decstaycharges + decmisc) Return total End Function Private Sub btncalc_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btncalc.Click Dim decmeds As Decimal Dim decsurgical As Decimal Dim declab As Decimal Dim decphys As Decimal decstaycharges = calcstaycharges(txtdays.Text) decmisc = calcmisccharges(decmeds, decsurgical, declab, decphys) total = calctotalcharges(decstaycharges, decmisc) lbltotal.Text = CDec(total) If validateinputfields() Then total = total.ToString("c") End If End Sub Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load End Sub End Class 
you parse it. html parsing libraries exist if you don't want to do ti the hard way...
All of this: decstaycharges = calcstaycharges(txtdays.Text) decmisc = calcmisccharges(decmeds, decsurgical, declab, decphys) total = calctotalcharges(decstaycharges, decmisc) lbltotal.Text = CDec(total) Should be inside this: If validateinputfields() Then ... End If 
HTML Agility Pack should be able to help you parse it out. 
I'm not quite sure what you're asking, but your code is not how it works. this is how it works https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/198974 it's likely not an array because multi file selection was an afterthought and they didn't want to break existing code that expects Filename to be a string, or create a new method.
Well it has to be a web application to be published to azure, so your winform app will not work. https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/uk_faculty_connection/2015/07/20/using-visual-studio-2015-and-deploying-your-first-web-app-to-your-free-azure-subscription/
Are you talking about wanting to run your compiled exe application on the college computer? Depending on what your app does, and if the school computers have the needed .net framework version, your program might not need to be installed at all to run. Publishing a WinForms app that would be runnable from Azure would require you pay to rent a virtual server running windows that you could install your app on and remote into.
It was originally based off of Basic if that is what you are asking. To program using it you can use Visual Studios. If you are just starting to program you might want to give VBA a shot. You can use it in many Microsoft Office products ( Excel, Word, Access ) when you are in one of these programs hit alt+F11 to enter the VBA editor.
You said that Roslyn is written in C# and VB.net. That made me curious so I looked it up and this is what Wikipedia says, "The project notably includes self-hosting versions of the C# and VB.NET compilers – compilers written in the languages themselves." It looks like the compiler portion that is for compiling VB is VB.net and the portion that is for compiling C# is written in C#. I didn't know this. 
快乐的25岁生日VB !!!!
What happens when you make `DC_Role_InitInfos.RoleRow` a `ReadOnly` field?
Tried it out, exactly the same behaviour. First Time the Row is nothing, after that it works flawless. Its weird.
Try using the ByRef keyword in your Build_Role parameter? As an aside, you may want to merge your object builder into your DC_Role class as a shared function instead of having an additional class dedicated just to building objects. This way, you can access private properties without needing to expose it to the object builder class (and, thus, necessarily all other classes).
I think this belongs over in r/vba.
What have you gotten done so far?
Good luck, I guess.
I'll add it there too, wasn't aware there was another one.
haha thanks?
What language is this? It isn't VB. VB doesn't use semicolons for comments (it uses ' or rem), EndIf isn't a VB keyword (VB uses 2 keywords End and If). We could probably help you anyway, but you said you are getting a compile error on 1 line of code, but posted like 100 lines of code and didn't say where the error is occurring. EDIT: I see you mentioned Blitz3D Basic at the top. I thought this was the name of your project. Blitz3D Basic looks like some BASIC derivative that is loosely based on the syntax of traditional BASIC languages. Still definitely not VB. Is this really what your teacher has you learning on? Why wouldn't they have you using actual Visual Basic from Microsoft? It is free....
You will want to utilize an array as "flags" for whether or not a particular letter has been guessed. Do you know how to use Arrays?
[Good luck.](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/visualbasic/)
my.settings object allows you to persist data to you config file for example my.settings.formtext = me.txtform.text my.settings.save() read it me.txtform.text = my.settings.formtext https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/saa62613.aspx
You could also write it to xml then parse it out when you want to load the settings. This also gives you the potential to make settings portable. Have a user that wants their setup exactly like another users? Boom, drop in thay xml file. 
What do you think is the best way to go about doing that? That is what I was initially thinking (but I was going to use JSON i think), I just couldn't figure out the best way to go about it.
Far below (Sub Test) is one way to copy and paste from one sheet to the other. To display the data in a message box you would need to declare variables for each column of data (Dim Col1_Data as Text, Col2_Data as Text, etc.) Assign the data to the variables Col1_Data = Cells(CopyRow, 1) Col2_Data = Cells(CopyRow, 2) etc. Declare a variable to hold the text message Dim myMessage Concatenate the variables into the Declared text message myMessage = Col1_Data &amp; " " &amp; Col2_Data &amp; " " ...etc Then display msgbox myMessage Sub test() Dim PasteSheet As Worksheet, CopyRange As Range, PasteRange As Range Dim LastRow As Integer, CopyRow As Integer, CopyColumn As Integer, PasteRow As Integer 'Where your cursor is becomes the row you copy CopyRow = ActiveCell.Row CopyColumn = ActiveCell.Column ActiveSheet.Range(Cells(CopyRow, 1), Cells(CopyRow, 7)).Copy ' 7 is arbitrary column based on picture Set PasteSheet = Application.Sheets("Sheet2") With PasteSheet LastRow = .Range("a65536").End(xlUp).Row ' find the last row of the pastesheet End With PasteRow = LastRow + 1 ' drop one row to paste PasteSheet.Range(Cells(PasteRow, 1), Cells(PasteRow, 7)).PasteSpecial End Sub There are a bunch of ways to do this...I'm a newbie as well. There are thousands of lines of code available all over the internet by Google searching.
I'm fairly sure that this is your application error handling. most likely you're missing a dependency, or some dep isn't registered yet I haven't tried w10 yet, but on 8.1 I have had some issues with projects that use custom activeX controls, requiring to run the IDE as admin. but not all activeX controlls, I couldn't figure out what was wrong with the ones that were a problem. I ended up merging the problem controls into a new project and it went away.
You can try using breakpoints on the side of this code to see which line isnt firing properly. Im working on something similar at the moment and had that error, turned out that my sql query syntax wasnt up to scratch. 
Thank you for taking the time to explain everything to me. I have updated the code to: Dim DS As New DataSet Dim DA As New OleDb.OleDbDataAdapter(SQL, CON) DA.SelectCommand = CMD DA.Fill(DS, "tblCustDet") Dim insertSQL As String = "INSERT INTO tblCustDet (CustomerName, Street, Suburb, PostCode, LandlineNumber, MobileNumber, EmailAddress) _ VALUES(@p1, @p2, @p3, @p4, @p5, @p5, @p7)" Dim insertCMD As New OleDb.OleDbCommand(insertSQL, CON) insertCMD.Parameters.AddWithValue("@p1", NAME1) insertCMD.Parameters.AddWithValue("@p2", STREET1) insertCMD.Parameters.AddWithValue("@p3", SUBURB1) insertCMD.Parameters.AddWithValue("@p4", PCODE1) insertCMD.Parameters.AddWithValue("@p5", HOMEPH1) insertCMD.Parameters.AddWithValue("@p6", MOBPH1) insertCMD.Parameters.AddWithValue("@p7", EMAIL1) DA.InsertCommand = insertCMD And finally, no error messages. The problem now is it doesn't write the data into the DB. I missed something else??? 
So the code you've shown me seems fine to me, can you show me where you're executing the sql? This is just setting the insert query: DA.InsertCommand = insertCMD .Fill executes the select command of your data adapter but we want to run the insert command. Now here's where I'm kinda hazy. I'm not sure DA.Update is called it will run your Insert command or not. When you call DA.Update on the adapter that has the insert and update query's set up, it will know which one to run, or it runs both I'm not sure. The way I have usually used adapters is you fill a dataset and then you can add a New row to the dataset when you want to add data, then call DA.update and it knows to run the insert command because you've added a new row to the dataset. Same for updating, you can edit the data in the dataset and when you call da.update it will know that row data has changed and run the sql update command. I'm not sure how much more I'll be able to help you. Just set breakpoints, step through the code. Always start small get one thing working before moving on to the next. If you get stuck you will probably have better luck starting a new thread and asking a new, more specific question to your new problem and posting code/error message like you did here. I think you're getting there. Good Luck 
I forgot to use single quotes around the double quotes in my query
Yes, exactly. Also, somethings must only exists as variables, as they cannot exist as a label or stuff like that. 
Thanks!
I see a lot of solutions to your problem, maybe some code from you would help to determine the easiest solution? First Ideas from the top of my head: * ~~Extend the Point Class~~ (Point ist a Struct in .Net, always check your facts, dont look dumb like me) * Create a own Point class which inherits the original Point Class * Create a Dictionary of(Point, Integer) and save the counter there * Just check on draw time if there are already 2 "usages" at this point, if yes skip the current line (not necessarly possible, depends on your code)
That's referring to creating a structure, right? Or is a "custom type" something else?
Eh, yes, `Structure` in VB. Structures don't support inheritance, unlike classes.
I would recommend against using custom structures containing changeable data until you have a firmer understanding of the language. They behave differently from classes and will cause unexpected problems. Just use a class instead.
This: 'Someone said ^2 is very slow Is very true. Exponential math is much slower than multiplication so if you are iterating through a lot of points it's worth using multiplication.
Rereading up on classes. That's exactly what I was looking for. Thanks. Any idea why "Loop until PolyPoints Is Nothing" goes into an infinite loop? 
It'll probably be supported at some point, as far as I understand the new Core infrastructure is designed so that languages can easily be added as extensions. In the end it's all IL anyway, so I'm guessing most of the work is just tooling. I believe F# already has partial support because some of the F# guys did the work, so perhaps someone will do the same for VB if the Core devs don't get around to it anytime soon. But MS has announced that they're focusing on C# for new features because VB.NET developers "value stability" or something, which sounds like a euphemism for demoting VB to a second class citizen (even more so than it already is in the eyes of many). So if you want to take advantage upcoming language features such as pattern matching, learning C# would be a good idea. Other than getting used to the syntax, it's not that big of a deal anyway. The underlying principles and libraries are the same after all, and since you can freely mix .NET assemblies from different languages you don't have to rewrite everything, you can just develop new projects in C# while keeping your VB code bases.
I did. they don't have it.
first, you're talking about VBA, not just VB, so that will make it more clear when you're searching. it's not clear on the details of what you want, but a button doing a thing should be easy, there's many examples out there.
&gt; Don't get me wrong That's the only way to get you. Because you're not right about much. 
no no no no,everything was there, I just dont know what happened. 
Moving forward use source control and check in regularly (VSO and git are free), this way you can see your previous changes and what may have been broken along the way. Also, it sounds like you may have been making too many changes between tests (or not testing at all). Look at this as a learning experience as typically a code change caused this rather than the lecturers machine.
If nobody helps you before I can get to my computer (few hours), Ill gladly hook you up.
Schools are terrible about this stuff. Teaching students VB6 is like teaching history but stopping at 1950 and acting like nothing has happened since. The IDE itself is no longer supported since 2008, and has known issues running on machines that aren't XP. If /u/DarkPulseModz isn't able to help you out, I can get you something tomorrow.
&gt;Teaching students VB6 is like teaching history but stopping at 1950 and acting like nothing has happened since This exactly. While I recognize its uses in the past, VB6 is outdated and unused, teaching an outdated computer science curriculum is the worst thing you can do to students, may as well cancel it seeing as the administrators know literally nothing about the market.
If you still need it, I'll check if it's in the MSDN. I have a license. 
The last thing I want to do is deprive you of a license that you obtained legally for your product.
MSDN VB6 ISO files have an embedded license key in them. Meaning there is no key to enter and there is no activation. Technically he can't "give" it to you, but I really don't think Microsoft is after VB6 users trying to learn for college. If anything they would just be mad you aren't being taught .NET
From memory (and I could be wrong) the license isn't embedded but the product key is static and given to all MSDN subscribers. 
Perhaps I'm not aware of this because I look at it from a game development side. I didn't know that jobs were still out for it
Being obnoxious just makes you look like a bigger dick when it turns out that you're wrong. 
Game development will get you worked to death and paid peanuts. 
He's right about the legacy apps and such but my opinion is it'll be like Cobol or something in that there will always be a niche market for skilled programmers in legacy languages, VB6 included. However for a shiny new college kid I wouldn't invest much mental energy into it beyond a cursory familiarity with it.
Simon says "Do it yourself!"
Is your question: Does FileSystemWatcher work with BackgroundWorker? If so, I don't know that. But you can create a window on a second thread within VB WPF. Then to stop it you would use WndProc to send the message to stop/end.
I dont know how you come to that conclusion? Have i overread something? He doesnt mention he needs to move the files exactly at the moment when they turn a specific age. I can imagine a lot of situations where the watcher is enough. Whenever something happens in the folder, check all the other files, move the old ones to the db and delete them from the folder. It could solve his problem, but of course depending on his exact goal. Maybe you are right and the Watcher is not enough. Just wanted to give him a hint that it exists
It doesn't close the log file until you exit the game. So if you try to read it just gives you an exception.
You could also just create a second executable.
Tweq hit the nail on the head.
The easiest way to manually manage your own DB format like this is to keep track if a record is in use or not - add a flag field, and recycle an unused record with new data when needed. Otherwise you need to move/re-org all the data after a deleted record, and truncate the file everytime you delete something. Normally this is performed as a "compact database" function 
Your in VB6, lvName.Subitem(0).Text.
Simplest way to do this is using a listview. Steps: Load Listview, Make Changes To Listview, Reorder, Write to File
This is specifically useful to data programming.
If you're using type Object(s) that are set to null by default you would not need this.
This is not useful to you?
Try double clicking the form so you get a Form_Load action, then put "Checkbox1.Checked = True"
cbxName.ischecked = true
Change the checked property to True in the properties section of the IDE. Or do it in code as DarkPulseModz described. 
Not that it is pertinent to your question, but why in the world are you using such an old version of VB?
Fair enough.
I don't mean to be rude, but where the hell do you even find a VB6 class in the year 2016? I think the only legal way to find a copy of VS6 these days is an MSDN subscription. It might be on Dreamspark as well if you have access to that, I'm not sure.
I bet it came with the text book. That's how I got my copy of VB 2 all those years ago.
TIL: vb6 is popular in indonesia...
Thanks, I'll look into this.
If I remember correctly from high school physics, gravity has a constant speed increase of 9.8m/s (meters per second) to a max velocity.
To be honest, I'm not even sure why I would use this. As far as I know all variable types can be set to nothing in VB WPF.
Letting it depends on results in the database, the connection and stuff like that won't be the problem, already have that working on other forms. This may sound dumb but the only thing I can't get to working is having a bloody checkbox checked when a form loads :/. I can't even get it to work without having a database involved.
If by *Don't really have a reason to get a newer version* you're talking financially, Visual Studio Community Edition is a full fledged professional version of Visual Studio and is free. Unless you start making a good amount of money with your applications or begin employing programmers it should never be an issue where you can't use it freely. There are many feature and language enhancements that would make life much easier than the version you're using. Plus, it's easier to get code help since people tend to forget that certain elements of their code were not available in the v1.1 framework so you get code help that won't even compile.
 if instr.contains("hello") then... Edit, sry, you said vb6, this is .Net.
Acceleration due to gravity isn't dependent on the presence of the atmosphere or not, it's a force and that's it. What limits the velocity is the resistance of the atmosphere acting on the falling object. So no, the situation he was trying to describe was not in a vacuum.
I will never post to StackOverflow ever again my life.

Not sure what the purpose of this post is?? You are just posting random links to MSDN pages? What does the VB6 resource center have to do with WPF?
Yeah I am serious. Just asking what the purpose of posting a link to an MSDN page about VB6 and then in that post, posing a comment link to a totally unrelated technology that has nothing to do with VB6. I don't understand the correlation here.
you're fired
basic reddit etiquette. what you're doing is posting redundant links for karma, it's frowned upon.
Oh, this is about me now. How about you stop picking on people, how does that sound?
He has been posting multiple nonsense links that just point to other articles or MSDN documentation pages. Literally nothing at all of value, just cluttering the sub with crap.
No one is picking on you. You can't just come into a sub and post a bunch of crap. Your posts don't provide anything useful to this sub. Anyone can go to MSDN and look up any topic, we don't need you randomly posting MSDN documentation links.
What's wrong with a constant downward force? For things like platforms and blocks and whatever else, give them a boolean flag like AffectedByGravity = False. For all game objects that don't have that flag, just apply said force to them every tick/game refresh.
Did you end up figuring this out?
He's correct. #3 and #4 are what's he's referencing. Essentially I need to indefinitely monitor a folder for files over a certain age (that are potentially large) and archive them automatically. Since a user is theoretically using the software while it's running, I want to do it asynchronously, but I'm having issues with how to work with BackgroundWorker to get started on this. FSW is pretty straightforward, launching BGW on an event (namely a button click) isn't from what I can turn up.
No. I ended up being away for Friday-late-Sunday (forgot I had a wedding this weekend) so I will be getting back to working on it tomorrow night.
You would have to create a custom form. If you truly want to the form to be forced to be seen, set it modal, and on top of all other forms. If you want to be truly obnoxious then set the form to some awful colour. Hell you could even make it fill the screen if you wanted. B Dim newForm as new {form you create as your template} newForm.topmost = True newForm.BackColor = Color.FromArgb(255,255,255) ' Your RGB obnoxiousness goes here. newForm.WindowState = FormWindowState.Maximized ' This shows how to deal with results from the form. If newForm.ShowDialog() = DialogResult.OK Then MessageBox.Show("OK Button Clicked") End If 
Oh didn't say how to make it flash. Put a timer control on the form and set it to 1000 Ms then in the time event do something like this If me.BackColor = vbRed then me.BackColor = vbGreen Else me.BackColor = vbRed End If
I would suggest at this point you should look at https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Visual-Basic-Development-for-Absolute-Beginners For it sounds like you need a crash course in event driven programming.
I follow what you are saying. So I am hearing that you don't have a problem with homework questions here in main sub but are concerned that we might answer something using methods outside the scope of what the teacher is expecting. Is this bad though? Would that not lead to better programmers? 
Well theirs the problem! VBA and Visual Basic .Net are two different programming languages. The same ideas apply but you need to use slightly different code. Is this Excel or Access? (or something else all together)
ok on the form you want to have the message popup from you are looking for the form event UserForm_Terminate http://i.imgur.com/6joECRH.png you can get to this by double clicking on the form and navigating there with the dropdown boxes. 
I don't think the total traffic is high enough in here to warrant that personally.
I wouldn't oppose getting rid of homework posts, since they are uninteresting for other readers and are arguably detrimental to the student. Though admittedly, without them this sub has even less "real" content than /r/csharp does, and the new homework sub would likely be a stillbirth. Perhaps a compromise could be instituting a rule like /r/csharp has, requiring requests for help to have some effort put into describing the problem and show their own attempt at solving it, rather than just being copy and pasted assignments and vacuous posts like "I don't know where to start" or "It doesn't work".
Yeah I agree; splitting the sub will likely just leave two dead subs instead of one somewhat quiet sub. I think it's fine to leave homework question seekers here and just let the community decide whether they want to answer said questions. There's already a massive downvote brigade whenever it comes to homework questions anyway, so those questions will naturally fall to the bottom. On that note, I would like to urge everyone to upvote good homework questions! You know, those who have a specific problem that they're grappling with, as opposed to people just trying to find some poor sap on the Internet to do their homework for them. These people should be applauded for their commitment to seeking answers outside of class and not downvoted simply because they're looking for help. Of course, if you find a bad homework question - i.e. questions from someone who skipped class and are now finding that they know nothing about programming - feel free to downvote away!
did you put controls on the form to show your message? When you use the Dim newForm as new UserForm1 it makes a copy of the form and all controls on it. At this point I cant really help you for you are lacking the fundamentals required to complete the task.
 Imports System.ComponentModel Public Class clsAd Public WithEvents BgWorker As New ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker() Private Sub BgWorker_ProgressChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As ProgressChangedEventArgs) Handles BgWorker.ProgressChanged ' Change value to enter this - it's not on separate thread (can access app globals) but can be axed when the original thread is ' spiking (so like an rtb output line may not happen) ' Normally I set a global in the bgworker to know what type of message it is, then set it to string.empty/"" ' To increment do: ' BgWorker.ReportProgress(10) ' System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(PauseLength) End Sub Private Sub BgWorker_RunWorkerCompleted(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs) Handles BgWorker.RunWorkerCompleted 'no longer on separate thread (can access app globals) End Sub Private Sub BgWorker_DoWork(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As DoWorkEventArgs) Handles BgWorker.DoWork Dim Worker As ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker = CType(sender, ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker) ' This is on a separate thread from you app - do work here End Sub End Class And then to start it just create a sub with a global, like so: Private Shared BgWorkerAd As clsAd Private Shared Sub StartBgWorkerAd() BgWorkerAd = New clsAd With BgWorkerAd .BgWorker.WorkerReportsProgress = False .BgWorker.WorkerSupportsCancellation = False .BgWinMain = modVar.TheWinMain .BgWorker.RunWorkerAsync() End With End Sub
Indeed I am, I use VB MVC Razor. How about for VB WPF? To be honest I'm in no rush. My biggest concern is getting WiX Toolset up and running with it.
Parsing local logs is easy, you can do a read of the log on a timer using; Dim value As String = File.ReadAllText("C:\file.txt") Then parse it with regex or whatever floats your boat. That's retarded by the way. I do something similar to what he is doing with the Arduino, except I update the rankings real time on the led board at the game center. The better way to do it is use the source Server queries API and request player info for the player you want to get info on. https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_queries Turn around time on this is latency based. For me to my servers its 52ms so I query about 10 times a minute to make sure I don't flood the server or my client. Here is a block of code Dim sIP As String = "192.168.0.154" Dim nPort As Integer = 27015 Dim connectionMessage As String = "ÿÿÿÿTSource Engine Query" &amp; Chr(0) Dim endPoint As New IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Parse(sIP), nPort) Dim client As Socket = New Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Dgram, ProtocolType.Udp) client.SetSocketOption(SocketOptionLevel.Socket, SocketOptionName.ReceiveTimeout, 6000) client.SendTo(System.Text.Encoding.[Default].GetBytes(connectionMessage), endPoint) Console.WriteLine("Message sent to " &amp; sIP &amp; ":" &amp; nPort &amp; vbCrLf &amp; connectionMessage) Dim sBuffer(1400) As Byte Try client.ReceiveFrom(sBuffer, endPoint) MsgBox(System.Text.Encoding.Unicode.GetString(sBuffer)) Catch ex As SocketException MsgBox("Failed to receive response on " &amp; sIP &amp; ":" &amp; nPort &amp; ":" &amp; vbCrLf &amp; ex.Message) End Try This just sends a message out on the server (its the only script I have handy...) this can be modified to get what you need if you look at the Server_Queries page I sent you. I own http://topnotchclan.com we run a popular set of servers and have spent a lot of time figuring out how to get what we needed. 
Since Core is not targeted at desktop as of yet, I doubt we will see WPF any time. I have already made some console apps so that works just have not seen much on desktop yet. Have you seen anything?
Haven't touched it.
I would of never thought of that. I tried the read all text and it just errored out every time because the file is open. 
I don't recall the details since it was back in the win2000 days when MS made the API change, but I'm sure if it was that simple then that's all we would have done.
which vb? there are ways to enumerate registry keys in all of them, but they are all different. you might start with a search of "enumerate registry keys {your vb version here}"
If there was some way to separate homework from other posts, that would be enough. That way homework posts are clearly what they are, and won't get mixed up with non-homework posts.
Sorry for the late reply, so I took your advice and started looking into array formulas. After a long time I finally found an array formula that worked! =MIN(IF([Serial Number[@[SerialNumber]],IF(NOT(ISBLANK([Service Date])),[Service Date],FALSE))) However when I try automating the array formula through a macro, the values came out different. Any advice?

VBA considering he said he wants the button to be in Excel.
I... don't think so. The program (which I do legally own) came with the .exe and a few other related files: a .dll, .ini, .ocx, and .log. I know so little about this that I just assumed the "source" code was inherent with the program itself... meaning it could be read/edited with the Visual Basic IDE. I'd contact the guy that originally adapted this from a similar motion control program, but he has since passed away. 
If the software at the link you posted could work for you, it would probably be much cheaper (at 69 euros) to buy it than to have the program redone from scratch.
I see. Thanks so much for taking the time to explain :)
Read, write, and evalute Registry keys in VBA. http://vba-corner.livejournal.com/3054.html 
It's like that in all my running projects. Are yours different?
It's like the XML specification, if you've ever worked with it in VS.
O I am familiar with it just not sure why you are seeing the error.
Not the encoding/UTF-8, the version. Well, if I remember correctly it was the version. I think it had to be 1.0, instead of some other. I think I remember it as an issue because of a schema check that did not work out.
thanks guys this said it hadn't posted yesterday so created a double post DOH! (work restriction on reddit) will have a read through totally new to vba (and any other form of programming) 
How about you let us know what you need help with, and show us what you've got so far. And we'd probably be able to help you for free.
i am late.. did the [code](https://www.reddit.com/r/visualbasic/comments/4masv7/backgroundworker_help_needed/d41g6v4) from /u/gyrospring help you getting started? 
I fully agree. Thanks for writing this out for me :)
A window/app handle check/comparison should show what thread the CandleWork procedure is on.
so...where is your script and what is not working?
No one to blame in this case. Its just the tag checker intended for helping with the web.config and it does its job because the packages file has the same ending. It should influence compiling in no way. 
But this is what i am saying? Or do i understand you wrong?
No No. Dead on.

You need to create a .bat file in VB? Something like System.IO.File.WriteAllText(DatFilePath, "") Use .Write* instead of Create because there is an access problem if you try and do something with the file right after creation.
Well, you're not wrong.
So, what you're controlling are arduino devices? Are they serial controlled or how are they controlled? 
Well, the code is in there of course since they're all that's needed to run the application. But it's compiled to machine code (or p-code) and doesn't resemble the easily read and edited source code in any way. You can reference COM components and p/invoke exported functions in .NET, but that still just calls the compiled code.
 Dim cont As Integer = 0 For f = lstHistorico.Items.Count - 1 To 0 Step -1 lstHistorico.Items.Add(lstHistorico.Items.Item(f)) lstHistorico.Items.RemoveAt(f) cont = cont + 1 Next
you can do this, for this instead of storing different label in text document store it in access database and retrieve it from database assign it to label
You know that it won't actually look like your code right? Also, i'm assuming you mean VB6, but you should probably mention that, or at least what version you need.
You can add another picture box into the first picture box. If you need layered transparency, you'll probably have to manually draw the images on top of each other in the control's `Paint` event instead.
Not so easy. The sin/cos/tan functions in VB6 require the angle to be passed in radians but I would guess OP's calculator is working with degrees. He has to do the conversion calculations himself.
Adding a multipier doesnt make it difficult ..
There isn't too much to explain and it is all written in that article. The VB6 sin/cos/tan functions require you to pass the angle in radians. However I expect you are working with degrees in your calculator. Therefore you have to convert degrees to radians before you can use the sin/cos/tan functions. The explain this here: &gt; An angle in degree has to be converted to radian before it can be calculated by the above trigonometric functions. From high school mathematics, we know that π radian is equivalent to 180°; which means 1 radian is equivalent to **π** divided by 180. Therefore, in order to convert an angle x from degree to radian, we have to multiply x by (**π**/180). However, there is a small problem because it is rather difficult to obtain the precise value of **π**, fortunately, there is a way to do it in VB. First of all, we know that an arc tangent of 1 will return the value of 45° which is **π**/4 radian. So, to obtain the value of **π**, just multiply the arc tangent of 1 with 4. Now, we are ready to enter the code for all the above additional buttons. (In reddit's font the character for pi (π) doesn't look very clear so I have bolded it above to make it stand out a little more.) After that explanation they give you the code for each of the functions you need. You have to interpret this code to make it work inside your own calculator program.
You know you can use immediates, right? You don't need to calculate out the constant(s) on the fly for conversion with all the trig and theory behind its creation. Based on what you're suggesting, even the example you linked is counter to your mantra, going that route of calculating PI is like suggesting OP not even use sin()cos() etc, but build polynomial functions to get the results.
&gt; Based on what you're suggesting, even the example you linked is counter to your mantra, going that route of calculating PI is like suggesting OP not even use sin()cos() etc, but build polynomial functions to get the results. How is OP supposed to directly use sin/cos/tan functions when his values are in degrees and he has no constant available for pi?
I have used. NET Reflector by Red Gate in the past to decompile VB.NET exe files. Maybe give this a try against your VB exe files and see what happens. The software comes in a free version which does a fine job. 
Wat. Just in case you're not trolling, you can actually type out numbers such as 3.14159265358979~ in your formulas. Variables and constants are not required for maths. Also, the conversion between deg/rad is linear so you don't need any functions: 1 degree = 0.01745329252~ radians . Multiply or divide accordingly to convert between the two. Spoiler: sin(DisplayVal * 0.01745329252) 
been a while since I looked at listview, doesn't it have methods on an item for getting the previous and next items? I don't recall how to get the first...
What does your drag/drop rearrange code look like that the index is not changing when the items are reordered by the user?
Not home, but maybe I can look into it for you. Edit: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/319399
Thanks I'll check this out.
This is my drag/drop code to rearrange the listview items. It all works fine, but the indexes are still in the order the items were added to the listview. Should I be doing something here to change them? Dim heldDownItem As ListViewItem Dim heldDownPoint As Point Private Sub ListView2_MouseDown(sender As Object, e As MouseEventArgs) Handles ListView2.MouseDown ListView2.AutoArrange = False heldDownItem = ListView2.GetItemAt(e.X, e.Y) If Not heldDownItem Is Nothing Then heldDownPoint = New Point(e.X - heldDownItem.Position.X, e.Y - heldDownItem.Position.Y) End If End Sub Private Sub ListView2_MouseUp(sender As Object, e As MouseEventArgs) Handles ListView2.MouseUp heldDownItem = Nothing ListView2.AutoArrange = True End Sub Private Sub ListView2_MouseMove(sender As Object, e As MouseEventArgs) Handles ListView2.MouseMove If Not heldDownItem Is Nothing Then heldDownItem.Position = New Point(e.Location.X - heldDownPoint.X, e.Location.Y - heldDownPoint.Y) End If End Sub
I guess it depends on how picky you are (and OP's teacher/prof is) about calculations and rounding.
I am confused by this code. You are not using the standard DoDragDrop and where is the DragDrop event? On the DragDrop event you can get the index of the item it is being dropped on and place the item before or after the index using insert. A hack to write out the order the user sets for the items you could add the item id to the tag of the item as it is being written then order by the tag before writing it out.
VBA 7.1 from Excel 2013, apologies for not including that previously
Thanks for the reply. I think I wasn't clear enough. The assignment wants me to do the following: If I want the number '7' to display in the textbox I would click on the button "BUTTON" seven times because each click of the button adds 1 (up to 9 because the Mod function resets it to 0). When I click the "NEXT" button the number 7 is locked in place and beside the number 7 to the right a new number is displayed and the number displayed is determined by the number of clicks on the button "BUTTON". For example lets say I want the number "32" displayed in the textbox I would hit the button "BUTTON" 3 times, I would then hit the "NEXT" button and then press the button "BUTTON" 2 times in order to display "32" in the textbox.
All you need to do is have a public integer that stores the current number of button clicks and a public string to store the "locked in" output. When "button" is clicked just add 1 to the int. Set the textbox text to equal the string plus the int (as a string). When the "next" button is clicked, set the string to the value of the textbox and reset the int to 0.
You could also assign the checkboxes a value under the application settings (this is a setting associated with the checkbox), and set up the presets in settings under application properties. Then they are saved when you change then automatic like. 
I'm late to the show I know, but SQL Server has a free edition that will allow you to program using SQL, which works pretty well.
To put a number next to another number, use the &amp; operator: Dim thirtytwo as string = 3 &amp; 2 Store the number of times you've clicked in an integer, then use the aforementioned operator to "add" (well, technically we say concatenate, but that's just a $10 word for "adding strings together") your new number to the existing number.
Have you gotten anything done that we can help with?

I would add a background worker object if you don't need a variable number of threads. If you need like 500 threads you'll need to create them in the code otherwise you can just use that and it'll be easy. Inside the thread you can have it send the email in a loop. pseudo code for each item in the list for integer 0 to X send email That's how I'd do it. The reason it stops responding is because you're doing it in your main thread which has the form in it. If you just create 1 extra worker thread then it'll do it all there and the form will still be interactable. One way you could do the updating is have the thread update a variable and then on the form have a timer that updates the label with the information from the variables. One could be for the number of emails sent and the other for the email string.
See [THIS LINK](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10182563/create-a-new-thread-in-vb-net) It's pretty easy Edit: Essentially, create your mail object method with a parameter to pass in the email address (and anything else you may process elsewhere) When you call it, make sure you call it kinda like this: Dim thread As New Thread(AddressOf sendMail(params)) thread.Start()

You don't need a new piece of software to do this .... you can find out what port the "appear online" part of the game uses, and block it in your firewall. It's probably an outbound connection, since the game is reporting your status to a server that everyone else sees. 
look up glasswire, you can block specific applications from accessing the network with it, with only one click.
You can edit the user's hosts file so that chat.euw1.lol.riotgames.com points to 0.0.0.0 which is an invalid ip address and thus blocks the connection to that URL.

If yes the reference *in the assembly tab* should be microsoft.office.interop.excel Oh and your line would look something like this: Dim xlsApplication As New Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Application Edit: And another tipp which may be helpful in some cases: Excel Sheets can be queried through [ado.db](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee692882.aspx), of course this is not always useful but sometimes i used it.
You can access Excel using late binding, you don't need to reference the Excel Object Library at all and your application can work with all versions of excel.

Every time the button is clicked you are setting the CurrentImage to Off with: Dim CurrentImage As String = "Off" Simplified: If Button1.Image = My.Resources.Off Then Button1.Image = My.Resources._On Else Button1.Image = My.Resources.Off End If

Console.WriteLine("Will retry...") Dim waitUtil = Now.AddSeconds(5) Do Thread.Sleep(0) Loop Until now &gt; waitUtil End If Loop Until success End Using Console.WriteLine("Done!") Normally you work with json using something like NewtonSoft's library, but in this case a simple string compare is more than enough... EDIT: Removed ".Dump" from code; corrected typo.
Thanks for the reply, but that's how I had it before since that's how I originally learned to make buttons toggle but it results in the error: Operator '=' is not defined for types 'System.Drawing.Image' and 'System.Drawing.Bitmap'.

That's how I came to this solution as well as using "Is" but that didn't help either.

Couple of things .... First; do you have Office 2007 or newer installed? If not then you'll need the ACE Redistributable, since ACE isn't part of Windows, and is only installed with Office (or manually with the Redistributable). Second; get rid of ADODB. That's an ancient COM object. If you absolutely need to use ADO, then use System.Data.OleDb 
Like he said, I think you can figure that out from the error message. It said "Provider cannot be found". And in your connection string you have the provider set to Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0. Which is the microsoft access oledb provider. It is probably not installed. You can test connection strings outside of the editor by creating a .udl file. Just create a test.udl file on your desktop. Then double click it and set the properties properly and then you can test it. If you can create the connection there, you should be able to create it in the code. When you open the udl file it will list the OLEDB providers which are installed. You can check which odbc drivers you have installed by using the odbc adminstration utility. odbcad32.exe. You'll find it in two places, one for 32 bit ones (Syswow64) and one for 64 bit ones (system32). If you are going to use an ODBC DSN you have to be sure to configure the right one for the application type. And as he said, use the .net oledb library rather than com based ado. Here is an article on that https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5ybdbtte(v=vs.71).aspx 
If you're working with Access [ACE.OleDB], this series may be of some use to you. [VB.NET MS Access Tutorials](https://youtu.be/q19OXha1jDw?list=PLy4rL7t3MquUcdVlDLrf8SQfdHQ6z3Cmm)
Since this is a class assignment, I'm going to go off of what you're working with. There are other alternatives that would be a better solution to this that you will want to read up on. One of them being *type*.TryParse() to ensure that you are working with the proper types. As far as what you're doing in class. You could check the String that the textbox holds to ensure that it doesn't include a decimal point (.) (see *string*.Contains() and could use the Val() method against the .Text property to make sure that it is &gt; 0. For something like this, it should appease the assignment you're given. You will find later on in larger programs that these methods aren't the best solution to these types of issues. The reason I bring up TryParse is that it would solve all of these problems without any other functions as it would store a successful type in a variable of that type and that type being numeric already would allow you to check if it is &lt; 0. Example: Dim answer as string = InputBox("Enter a positive integer") Dim value as Integer If Not Integer.TryParse(answer, value) then MessageBox.Show("No, I said enter an integer") Else 'it was successfully parsed to integer 'so let's make sure it's positive. 'Because upon success *value* 'now holds the number entered 'so we can just check to see if 'it's less than 0 and react accordingly. If value &lt; 0 then MessageBox.Show("It must be a positive integer") End If End If
I must be getting old this is what I thought of first as well.
thank you 
Hey so the problem is with the string. You have to remember that the ors need to be inside the the double quotes. in this part: &amp; strSEARCH &amp; "'" Or "[Street] = '" &amp; strSEARCH Should actually be: SOURCE.Filter = "[CustomerName] = '" &amp; strSEARCH &amp; "' Or [Street] = '" &amp; strSEARCH &amp; "' Or [Suburb] = '" &amp; strSEARCH &amp; "' Or [PostCode] = .... So what I did is took out the double quotes before and after all the ores. What you want to send as the filter should be one string. What I would do to make sure it's what you want is assign the filter string to a string before you assign it to the filter. Then you can use the debugger to look at the string after it's been assigned and see if it's what you want. Also, don't forget that if you don't use % it's only going to show those records that the search parameter matches exactly. So you could say source.filter = "[street] = '%" &amp; strname &amp; "%'" There is also a good discussion over at stackoverflow about like vs = for string. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/543580/equals-vs-like

How basic is your programming skills? Are you looking for a console/forms display? Firstly the entering of data is as easy as console.readline, or use of a text box. With the former, a isnumeric() check (gives boolean value) and some &gt;0 or whatever validations if you want to exclude negatives/extremes. To calculate average simply store the data given to a running total, after all days entered divide by number of days and output. With you wish for time/distance being separate the best way is with a simple prompt or allow them to add units after and use mid() to search for it. If the units don't match, ask for them to reenter. We're you wanting exact code or something, or is there specific parts we could help with? :)

Can you post in a gist ValidateForm, and ClearError?https://gist.github.com/ Also are you changing any of the default properties of the control because I can't recreate this bug in visual studio so it does work by default.

2D games are simple to do in VB, 3D a bit more complex since you'll need to tie in some method of outputting graphics (DirectX, or even Unity with C#). But 2D graphics is certainly doable. As for learning how to make a game, you're gonna have to understand video game mechanics, and game design, so the /r/gamedesign sub might be a good place to begin learning the programming aspect of video games. Data Structures, grid mechanics, simple physics engines if your game requires those, etc. I'm not sure why people are so upset about your question here, as it's fairly simple to answer. Yes, you can make games with VB, it's not the most common language to do this in, but it's entirely possible. I recommend starting with small board games like battleship, and checkers so you can begin to understand how turn based, grid mechanics work. From there, you can probably begin recreating the simpler arcade games such pong, and breakout. After that, side scrollers with simple physics engines will look much easier to do, and after you master those, RTS style gameplay, which could incorporate all the game mechanics I mentioned in this post.

That said, the link above is to a pretty ancient uncontrolled hard-looped game which eats CPU. Here is his very simple timer-based 2D GDI game project: [DragonDrop 3](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s0kurdcqcql835l/DragonDrop3.zip?dl=0) It consists of two classes - The main form, and a basic flocking Mob class. There are also some old VB/XNA tutorials there on there on RPG mapping, NPCs, stackable inventory, etc. Since XNA has gone the way of the Dodo, Monogame is recommended and virtually identical in use.
You can directly transfer all of this logic into a pictureBox: Move the code into the pictureBox.Paint event, and use pictureBox.Invalidate to force it to redraw. Your coordinates will all be based on the pictureBox location, instead of the form, and allows you to move the pb around without having to rethink the coordinates. For static display, you could also do all of this by creating a bitmap in memory, drawing everything onto that bitmap, and then set the picturebox.Image to the bitmap: Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Dim bm_result As New Bitmap(200, 200) Using gr As Graphics = Graphics.FromImage(bm_result) Dim xpen As Pen = System.Drawing.Pens.Black gr.DrawLine(xpen, 15, 15, 25, 25) End Using PictureBox.Image = bm_result End Sub Since you are creating a bitmap in memory, the image will persist on form repaints. Which method is better is really subjective, and will depend upon what your end goal is. 
my VBA is weak and old, so unless there some new fancy merge sheets command I dont' know about, you have to specify the cells to copy/move and their destination specifically. 
Yeah I did the bitmap method once when I programmed the Sierpinski gasket. Good to know I can work in a picture box if necessary. I'm working on a simulation for the Traveling Salesman problem so I'll see which method works best. Thanks again for the help!
Have you tried recording a macro and looking at the VBA that is generated? You should be able to tell where it switches tabs, selects cells, copies, and pastes. Then, you can just tweak it as needed.
The loop is really not such a bad thing so long as it's not uncontrolled. If you use some form of control mechanism [i.e., threading and thread sleeping] so that all of your processor cycles are not going to into unnecessary drawing loops, your application should be more responsive and should be able to dedicate more to processing game logic. If I understand correctly, this is why many games employ Vsync to cap the FPS around 60.
Abit late to discussion but if your interested in 3d programming and using VB.NET look into OpenTK which is a OpenGL library for all .NET languages.
That was indeed the problem, thank you!
Can you post an actual code sample of what your issue is because I am having a hard time following your pseudo code example. You declare an integer, pass it byref to a function which in turn passes it to another function (or multiple functions) and then at some point one of these functions raises and event which accepts an object array as a parameter and this integer was placed inside the object array? When you access the integer in the object array it is 0? Is that what you are saying?
I currently dont have access to the files, I'll upload an example tomorrow if that's alright?
Sure. 
You could always build a query in access if it's a known, permanent string you're looking for. Good luck! 
If at any point you are taking a value from your object array (which I'll refer to as 'params') and passing it into another function, it will either pass a reference to that value (classes, arrays, etc.) or it will pass a copy of the value (integer, byte, etc.). In your case, I assume you're doing something like this: DoSomething(params(0)) Sub DoSomething(ByRef value As Integer) value += 1 End Sub In this scenario, params(0) is being passed by reference but it's a reference to a NEW copied value and as such it won't update the value stored in params(0). What you should be doing instead is this: DoSomething(params) Sub DoSomething(ByRef params As Object()) params(0) = DirectCast(params(0), Integer) + 1 End Sub That being said, I really think the best practice here would be to create a custom EventArgs type and pass that around instead of an object array. Public NotInheritable Class MyEventArgs Inherits EventArgs Property MyValue As Integer End Class This way you can easily add / remove parameters without being worried that you'll break the indices. It will also help performance since you won't need to cast constantly. Also, it's the recommended practice for events! :) 
I think the problem with that is, that I'm using a Dll which doesn't give the result as a return value but stores it in a referenced variable. This means I currently have to break up the object array in the function that changes the value(?). I uploaded an example project in the other comment, maybe that helps, or maybe I'll just have to find a different way to do this.
Well I didn't have any good algorithm since I didn't even know what a summed area table was. Seemed interesting though, so after a bit of trial and error, I came up with this: Sub Main Dim matrix = New Integer(,) {{5, 2, 3, 4, 1}, {1, 5, 4, 2, 3}, {2, 2, 1, 3, 4}, {3, 5, 6, 4, 5}, {4, 1, 3, 2, 6}} Dim sat = SummedAreaTable(matrix) End Sub Function SummedAreaTable(matrix(,) As Integer) As Integer(,) Dim sat(matrix.GetLength(0) - 1, matrix.GetLength(1) - 1) As Integer For x = 0 To matrix.GetLength(0) - 1 For y = 0 To matrix.GetLength(1) - 1 Dim A = If(x &gt; 0, sat(x - 1, y), 0) Dim B = If(y &gt; 0, sat(x, y - 1), 0) Dim C = If(x &gt; 0 Andalso y &gt; 0, sat(x - 1, y - 1), 0) Dim M = matrix(x, y) sat(x, y) = M + A + B - C Next Next Return sat End Function Results: http://imgur.com/b6kYcZx EDIT: Simplified the function.
In your Speicher class, in the constructor Friend Sub New(ByRef pi_iVariable) m_iVariable = pi_iVariable End Sub You pass in pi_iVariable ByRef, but you are assigning its value to m_iVariable. Integers are value types not reference types, so as soon as you do that assignment, that is where it ends for pi_iVariable.
Ah okay, so basically I'm not storing a pointer or sth but a value. I managed to make a workaround, but thank you anyway!
Yes correct. Value types work this way. Glad you found a workaround!
this is built in, you just need add a little code, but that depends on what vb version you're using.
Literally a single google search away http://www.authorcode.com/drag-and-drop-between-two-listbox/
I liked Sam's Teach Yourself, granted I've only used the 2012 version; none the less, if you follow along you'll have legs of your own to walk on in the Visual Basic development environment.
That's fine. Nothing big has changed since then and it will be cheaper for them. Thank you.
Is it crashing on the RichTextBox1.Text = RichTextBox1.Text &amp; "&gt; " &amp; file.Name.ToString &amp; vbNewLine line or the files = dirinfo.GetDirectories("*", IO.SearchOption.AllDirectories) line. Which Visual Studio version and is it x32 or x64? What operating system? How much memory do you have? I tried it on my machine Win 10, x64 24GB or ram, with 50,000 directories with 9999 files per folder. By the way, that took forever for the script to run to create that, and even longer to parse. :) EDIT: Typo 
yes but at the press of a button? i think its overflowing
x64 Win10, 16gb of ram... can this process be broken down with multi threading?
What exception is thrown specifically? You shouldn't be getting an overflow unless there are literally 10's of thousands of files in the directory. In which case, you should be using a StringBuilder (you should use it here anyways). Dim Builder As New System.Text.StringBuilder() For Each file In files Builder.AppendFormat("&gt; {0}", file.Name) Builder.AppendLine() Next RichTextBox1.Text = Builder.ToString()
Is textboxname_ a variable created elsewhere, or a string created in this code? If it's a variable then you need to use it without quotes.
Another tutorial that may be of some use, though it is not specifically targeted to ListBoxes. [Drag &amp; Drop](https://youtu.be/dihcrAcKhXM)
think? don't think. analyse the error messages and know why it's crashing. for all you know it's crashing because you have a bad memory module.
Error: An unhandled exception of type 'System.NullReferenceException' occurred in SoftwareV1.exe Additional information: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
no work Me.Controls("Rigol_Vpp_1").Text = "newvalue" neither does this: Dim temp As String = "Rigol_Vpp_2" Me.Controls(temp).Text = "newvalue"
thanks i renamed them various things getting one to work leads to the rest
SOLVED Thank you all for the help: Dim H As Int16 = 1 Dim Ctr() As Control = Me.Controls.Find("Rigol_Vpp_" &amp; H, 1) Ctr(0).Text = "blah"
Now I wonder what "Me" is. The code needs to be in the form module. If that doesn't work try For each c in me.controls: debug.print c.name:next. See what that gives you. 
The Listbox control has a Sorted property, if you set it to True it will sort the items. Combos have the same property too. 
Also this is for Word documents.
You can iterate through the list and do a File.Copy using the source name and a string for the destination name.
Personally, I use case if I need more than one elseif for any statement. Maybe just for formatting you could have the upper if as a case, but really it wouldn't do much other than look different in VB. If what you have works then..? 
"Visual Programming Flow Chart is a supplementary teaching tool designed to help students understand program control flow. It generates flow charts for functions and saves them in the JPG picture format. This tool is easily activated from the Visual Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) by simply right-clicking on a function name and choosing “Generate flow chart…” from the context menu. The resulting flowchart can be customized by changing its colors and other effects. This visual tool provides an intuitive way to explore source code, to examine its control flow, and to identify logic errors." not sure if it includes source, but I found a pile of hits from google. https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/2A06FB8C-C2B1-417B-9F7D-57254D74905E/ http://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?761139-How-do-i-draw-flow-chart-using-VB-NET-(programatically)

Your thinking of Placeholder text, I believe.
Thank you I will check it out
When drawing (0,0) is in the upper left hand corner. Find the center of your drawing area and offset the points to get a centered drawing. Edit: also I think you need to go longer. Change to a do while and a bigger step size. 
Sure! So my program updates an access database that's a repository of all orders that come through my office. It's a simple form, I put in the work order, it pulls up what it is and who ordered it, I out in who picked it up, the date it was picked, and the tech who handed it off. I click a Save button (just a normal button with a click event) and it updates the database with the information. What I would like to do is have them sign it as well (it will be a tablet that we are working from). Ultimately it'd be awesome to attach the signature to the entry in the database, but for now, I'm happy saving the signature in a folder. I am using an inkpicture object to capture the signature, but the code that I've found to save the ink as a file (either .isf or .gif) isn't actually doing anything. I'm trying to bind that save to the same clickbutton event as the access update. Is that helpful at all, or am I just making the waters murkier? I'm not a programmer by any means, I'm just trying this to A) deepen my understanding of the language, and B) get my team paperless.
You are using the Microsoft InkPicture control? It has a DrawToBitmap method. You should be able to use that to pass in a blank bitmap object of the size you want, and then you can call .save on the bitmap to save it to disk.
In your first option, you are checking for the first condition, displaying the result, and then the second condition, and using the same fields to display the result (overwriting the first one). I don't think the instructions mean that you should separate the conditions. The criteria should always be condition 1 OR condition 2, but they are asking you to use nested IFs (as you are using in the second example) and then a single IF with a lot of parentheses.
This should work for you: Public Function DeleteFile(ByVal Path As String) As Boolean Dim FSO As Object Dim Target As Object Set FSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject") If FSO.FileExists(FilePath) Then Set Target = FSO.GetFile(Path) Target.Delete If FSO.FileExists(FilePath) = False Then: DeleteFile = True End If Set FSO = Nothing Set Target = Nothing End Function 
that's basically what the code already does.
JUST a comma. no space. 
You're a genius and I love you. Thanks.
Are you using stringbuilder?
unless you're going to have more than a few, just call the function multiple times. otherwise you'll want to make strFolder an array also and add another `for each` to iterate it
this could end up being up to 10 mapped drives. I'm really shaky with arrays honestly, I took programming and VB in college but at this point all I remember is that it starts at the 0 position. Any luck you can help me with the formatting necessary to get it started? Like where I should be putting the array, etc. 
That fixed it! Wow stringbuilder.append is fast. Note to the person reading this in 3 years: You are looking for System.Text.StringBuilder 
Awesome :)
I think a thing to remember with doing complex string manipulation, a new string object is created and then left for the garbage collector. &gt; Use StringBuilder for Complex String Manipulation When a string is modified, the run time will create a new string and return it, leaving the original to be garbage collected. Most of the time this is a fast and simple way to do it, but when a string is being modified repeatedly it begins to be a burden on performance: all of those allocations eventually get expensive. Here's a simple example of a program that appends to a string 50,000 times, followed by one that uses a StringBuilder object to modify the string in place. The StringBuilder code is much faster, and if you run them it becomes immediately obvious. - [Source](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms973839.aspx)
I remember having troubles with this call on hidden and special folders (especially C:\System Volume Information) due to the NTFS rights: &gt; dirinfo.GetDirectories("*", IO.SearchOption.AllDirectories) If you put in a try catch, does it give you an exception like access denied? Something like this (untested) try files = dirinfo.GetDirectories("*", IO.SearchOption.AllDirectories) catch ex as exception msgbox(ex.message) end try 
You are writing everything to the same textbox and overwriting whatever is there, so it should only display the result of the last if statement. You actually first want to change all txtResult.Text = To txtResult.Text = txtResult.Text &amp; ", " That will allow you to see the results of both statements. If that's what you want to do. For your second example, you're checking for B only if A is true and .Text &lt;= 5000. B will never get evaluated if A is not true. If &lt;condition&gt; Then &lt;code&gt; ElseIf &lt;condition&gt; Then &lt;code&gt; Else &lt;code&gt; End If You can put another if statement in any of the &lt;code&gt; blocks. Indents are optional. Remember that syntax. You will use it a lot. 
enjoy your F, you deserve it.
This should be a sticky Bone.
You can think of this as a vector based physics engine. You'll have two main vectors to keep track of, your ship's vector and the input vector. Each vector has two main components: Speed, and Direction. Your input vector will affect your ship's current vector, altering its direction. After that, it's just keeping track of particles (they have constant speed and direction), whether they're bullets, asteroids, or other ships (Which may require more vectoring) but it can be as complex as you'd like.
Is there a good tutorial or resource for vectors specifically for VB? I can't seem to find one in English. 
Of course this is possible, as for how easily it could be accomplished, that part might take a bit of work.
In your personal opinion, what level difficulty would you consider this? I don't want to start a project if I'm way too in over my head. 
To understand the majority of what would go into this, you would need an intermediate knowledge in order to work with multidimensional arrays. The majority of the work however, is figuring out an algorithm that would allow you to go step by step with as many points as possible.
To make a solver, you basically have to make the game itself. Not the UI and graphics, but the back end logic of the game (the board layouts, the board progression when a block/group of blocks is clicked on, and the point calculation involved). You need those pieces of logic in place to simulate games to tally points, and run through each scenario until the level is done, and pick the one with the highest point value.
I assumed as much. Thank you!
I'm guessing that it's slow because you're storing your results in the ListBox as you're finding them. The ListBox probably isn't very well optimized for search and for adding items. I recommend you use a Dictionary (Of String, String) instead. Add the files to that Dictionary in the loop, then when the loop is finished you can bind the ListBox to the Dictionary (which may not be possible; I haven't tried that. If not you might need to use another collection type that it can bind to). See this for more info on Dictionaries: http://www.dotnetperls.com/dictionary-vbnet If nothing else, a minor optimization would be to move the ListBox1.SelectedIndex = 0 and ListBox1.Focus() lines outside the loop. I'm guessing you're trying to show feedback to the user but that is also probably slowing the loop down considerably.
ooh, did not notice that selectedindex and focus were inside the loop. Will also look into storing the items into a different collection. Thanks!
ok... i think, that you are close... but, i would do it not on this way ;-) i would make my complete own control! inherit from control and numericupdown. set the numericupdown the width and a fixed height at the bottom of the control. the rect (minus height from numericupdown) is the draw rect. with this way, you have only one control to add! im not at my Desktop, but i will throw it together, when i am at home! 
Oh no, this IS a user control, and I've done what you said. My problem is that the rect where the circle is drawn does not size properly until the next draw call.
This is a good place to start. http://www.harding.edu/fmccown/vbnet_csharp_comparison.html My personal opinion? Don't worry about Upper/Lower case, semi colons, and brackets. And Get used to IF / END IF, rather than arbitrary start and end characters (i.e. brackets).
Remember, in general VB is very high level language. If it's an if conditional, its "If X=3 then... end if"... none of this obscure "if (x==3) {}" business. Nothing wrong with C#, but it's syntax is very arbitrary, where as VB is actually very structured and plain-spoken.
Thanks for that. I'm doing the double whammy of diving into C# while also moving over to WPF/XAML. I already prefer WPF to winforms.
Being able to work in both is an important skill for a developer who enters a new organization. There are always lots of little programs written in VB.NET. Using the code converters are time honored tradition to get from "I know how to do this in C#, how is the it reorganized in vb.net?" I would also suggest something like Just Code by Telerik it will help keep your code organized and structured correctly.
Yes it is.
Extra bonus points if you can add clean parsable logging to any of these
&gt; Besides that, you are wide open for a SQL injection attack if you put user-entered text directly into your SQL like this. Also, I don't remember the exact command but there's a way to execute SQL without returning data, which you want to do in this case, so you don't need ExecuteReader(). I believe what you're thinking of is ExecuteNonQuery()? ExecuteScalar() is also useful for returning count queries to pass on as variables.
Are you attempting to allow each individual piece work as an independent plugin? Or are you just throwing a bunch of separate DLLs out there and expect them to work together?
You'd need to write a loop that gets Max rows, then check cell1 in an if statement to determine what goes into cell 2.. not at my pc at the moment so can't give you any code examples.. if you still don't have any examples or success in the next 5 hours I'll have a look when I get home.
There was a Cal tech class, free, posted on reddit about two years back. In my experience, outsource Web dev, vb is a citrus mistress for certain purposes.

 SpanTags = WebOC.Document.GetElementsByTagName("span") For Each span As HtmlElement In SpanTags Dim ClassStr As String = span.GetAttribute("class") If ((ClassStr IsNot Nothing) And (ClassStr.Length &lt;&gt; 0)) Then If ClassStr.ToLower().Equals("listings1") Then ' Do stuff here End If End If Next You'll have to do something like the above.
I used Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Programmer's Guide
I believe you want "IIf(...)" not "If(...)".
You need to supply the values for a and b Dim Max = (Function(a As Integer, b As Integer) If((a &gt; b), a, b))(5, 4)
IF() is perfectly valid and is a short circuiting operator unlike IIF() which evaluates both the true and false arguments regardless of whether or not it needs to. IF() only looks at the true or false result based on the result of the test expression.
I wouldn't waste any time with VB6. While it most closely resembles VBA, it's 18 year old technology at this point and really not worth learning. As you pointed out, VBA (and VB6) forms can't really be created or modified outside of the IDE, so that leaves text editors out for those products. You also can't compile without the IDE (VB6) or host Office app (VBA). IMO, .NET is really the way to go. Visual Studio is probably never going to work as a portable app, but the alternative IDEs have some potential. Text editors are a real option, as everything in .NET is text (even the drag and drop forms designer is just writing the code that makes up the form for you). While it wouldn't be super easy to create large projects (and forms design would be tiresome), you can write .NET in a text editor, and compile into an executable without ever touching an IDE (the compiler is part of the installed framework). Any change away from VBA will require a bit of learning, but it will also open up a huge amount of power. Personally, I'd recommend starting with a local install of VS Community 2015, and go through the Visual Basic for Absolute Beginners link in the sidebar. That should get you up to speed, and help you figure out the differences from, and similarities to, VBA. Then you can switch to something like Sharpdevelop for a portable IDE (it won't be quite as nice as VS, but it isn't a bad IDE). 
Thanks, I'll give VS2015 a shot. I just finished installing it. It does feel very bloated that it's making it hard to find what I'm looking for. Love the dark interface though and that helper thing is probably less annoying than the old way syntax correction worked in VBA. Not a fan of my IDE needing a login and password to open ! I'm doing a custom user interface that remote controls the SAP interface (horrible corporate software) (which is quite horrible and inefficient to use). If the learning curve is somewhat shallow this might just work ! I'll only have about 15'000 lines of code to port from VBA to VB.NET. Hopefully sharpdevelop portable isn't too different from VS2015 so I don't have to relearn too much when I start using it. 
There will be no web access from when I run my program. Also VB is the language I know, learning another language feels like a bigger task than writing the program or continuing living with excel.
if what you know is VBA inside excel, you'll already be learning a new language. even VB6 isn't *that* similar to VBA to remove a learning curve, and VB.net is practically a whole different language. just learn a new language. the 2nd one isn't that hard, and each additional one gets that much easier. not having web access means you're going to have to have one hell of a reference manual, and without google to add contextual search it's going to be a rough road no matter what.
Here's some quick code for rounding up, may need to tweak it a bit for larger numbers, but it seems to do the job adequately. Public Function RoundUp(ByVal Unrounded As Long) As Long RoundUp = Math.Ceiling(Unrounded / (10 ^ (Len(CStr(Unrounded)) - 1))) * (10 ^ (Len(CStr(Unrounded)) - 1)) End Function I can imagine needing to have a loop that increments your rounded up value so that the `block_dimension MOD round_up_value` is equal to zero. But I'm headed to bed, and can look at this more in the morning.
Yes, I have been researching vbscript. The show stopped has been the lack of a userform object. There was those HTA forms but that introduces a ton of limitation. Python (and java too I guess) are interesting, they would work in most environments. One thing I really like about VB is the use of carriage return as an end of line character, on the fly syntax validation (like when it auto adds spaces and not turn red when you move from a line) and intellisense which has been invaluable in helping me learn to use VB. Are there any IDE with at least the two last features for python or java ?
I'm not much for Java but I can say Visual Studio Code gives pretty good Intellisense for python with the proper plugin, aptly named "Python". There are several GUI libraries too. Using VS Code might require that you set a setting to tell it where your python interpreter is located though. Here is a link to the zip version of Visual Studio Code... https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=winzip Java might be an option but I tend to think you'll end up in the same position as with VB. The IDEs that I am aware of aren't very portable and the Java runtime isn't always available. 
As blunt as it might be, have you considered having a full screen borderless form with a black background and simply adjusting its opacity while passing all clicks and actions through? Public Class Form1 Inherits System.Windows.Forms.Form Private Const GWL_EXSTYLE As Integer = (-20) Private Const WS_EX_TRANSPARENT As Integer = &amp;H20 Private Declare Function SetWindowLong Lib "user32" Alias "SetWindowLongA" (ByVal hwnd As IntPtr, ByVal nIndex As Integer, ByVal dwNewLong As Integer) As Integer Private Declare Function GetWindowLong Lib "user32" Alias "GetWindowLongA" (ByVal hwnd As IntPtr, ByVal nIndex As Integer) As Integer Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Load With Me .Width = My.Computer.Screen.Bounds.Width .Height = My.Computer.Screen.Bounds.Height .Top = 0 .Left = 0 .Opacity = 0.5 .TopMost = True SetWindowLong(Me.Handle, GWL_EXSTYLE, GetWindowLong(Me.Handle, GWL_EXSTYLE) Or WS_EX_TRANSPARENT) End With End Sub End Class 
[The format](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pgm.html) looks pretty simple, shouldn't be too hard to write a parser for it.
For PGM P2, however P5 is far more difficult unless you have a solution in mind :D
As far as I can tell, the only difference is that the data portion consists of binary values instead of ASCII digits, so you'd read the header the same as for P2 and then read the rest e.g. directly with `Stream.ReadByte()` or with `BinaryReader.ReadUInt16()` for 16 bit files.
I don't know what you are doing outside of this example, but I think you are missing steps in creating your picture box. Here's a good stack overflow on basic picture box setup and casting. I'd work on making it work one before looping. When looping you'll also need a mechanism that loops through them so it all doesn't happen within 1 second. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14629890/vb-net-assign-image-to-picturebox-through-panel-controls 
Breakpoints are pretty cool. I'm still at a loss. At the breakpoint, the data tip tells me that _strInitList has a length of 31 on the line above, but then at the breakpoint, it says _strInitList(1) is nothing, just one line down. same at _strInitList(0) or _strInitList(n) where n=0 (which is what I have posted above)
Why not just eliminate _strInitList &amp; access _strLabels directly?
I did manage to find a solution which I think is correct. I just used the return values for each letter (asc() function). Would that not work?
I suppose it might work, it just seems unnecessarily complicated to me. ASCII is a 7-bit character set, I'm not sure how this solution would behave for bytes &gt;= 128. I suspect it might return inconsistent results depending on the system language, but I don't have a PC to test it right now. It also wouldn't handle 16-bit files, but of course I don't know if you have any in that format in your data set.
VB.NET doesn't use ASCII at all, it uses Unicode/UTF16 internally. I'm not sure what the legacy `LineInput` method uses to decode the file, probably the local Windows codepage, but I can't check on my phone. Anyway, if you tested it and your current solution works for you feel free to keep using it. My parser also handles files with arbitrary sizes and maximums, but if you don't need that that's fine, too.
Also, with the specifying the text, I assume, you mean making the text static is easy, but dynamically pulling it from say the first line of each new page would be difficult? 
The only way I can think of doing that and having the output still be a word document format would be to remove pages and then save as, then reload the document and repeat (removing the pages already exported and the ones after the pages you want). I would imagine this to be a somewhat slow process. There may be a way to select pages as a range and copy them (via code) to a new document and save, but my VBA is pretty rusty. This KB talks about sort of what you want, and although it is for 2003, it should still the same idea. Just keep in mind what you are trying to do isn't exactly a trivial task for someone new to coding. https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/306348
Awesome, thank you my man!
Use got focus and lost focus If the text box contains no text and loses focus set the text If the text box has the "enter username text" and receives focus then clear the text box.
Set the default homepage for the control and continue using text box text for webpage navigate.
A cheap way is using the forms opacity.
When you create a program in Visual Studio, you usually start with building a form using their graphical WYSIWIG editor. While you're dropping components onto your form, VS is auto-generating the code in the background to create those components. This is 'generated code'. So, when the submitter said 'non-generated code', he meant all of the code he wrote directly, minus the UI initialization code. To use it, you'll need to draw your own form with all of the same components, then copy and paste the code into the form's code (the file you get to when you right-click the form name in Project Explorer and select View Code). When designing the form, it is very important that you name your components exactly what the submitter named them. Looking at the code and UI, it doesn't look too hard to figure out which components were named what.
It took some more trial and error, but I managed to get it working. I could never have done this without your help, so thanks a lot!
Wait, so which is it? &gt;whenever i click button1 on form1 it will open form2 with the textbox that says "blahblah" or &gt;when i click the button it just opens form 2 with nothing in the textbox ? Is "the button" not button1?
Can't you just convert the values? Or look up the average rate of weight loss
Have you verified that there is no exception? In case of an exception your code will skip the "textbox.text = data" part. If there is no exception, have you checked that data actually contains anything?
Maybe your httpwebrequest is occurring before the goUrl.Text is populated. Swap from onLoad to Activated. See : https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.form.activated(v=VS.90).aspx
Here's an example of creating a grid of buttons programmatically; it might give you enough to get going. Private Sub FGrid_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load Const w = 64 Const h = 36 Const offset = 50 For x = 0 To 11 For y = 0 To 11 Dim button = New Button button.Width = w button.Height = h button.Left = x * w + offset button.Top = y * h + offset button.Text = "F" button.Font = New Font("Arial", 20, FontStyle.Bold) AddHandler button.Click, AddressOf buttonClick Controls.Add(button) Next Next End Sub Private Sub buttonClick(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Dim btn = DirectCast(sender, Button) Select Case btn.Text Case "F" : btn.Text = "O" Case "O" : btn.Text = "S" Case "S" : btn.Text = "F" End Select End Sub
Can you think of any way to avoid using 28 lines adding the buttons to the list?
Ok Ive got the grade stuff all calculated but I want to save the items in the listbox. How would i go about doing that? Cheers
Listbox.Add(DataHere)
For each listbox item you want to put it into an XML document. Sorry for not sharing examples, away from the desk. I have a whole parser example created somewhere, just have to find it.
Hey, i found a workaround for this. However I have encountered another problem. Right now I want to add numbers in two different listboxes. The first number in listbox1 will correspond to the first number in listbox2 and so on. My current code: Dim sum1 As Double For x As Integer = 0 To ass1_listbox.Items.Count - 1 sum1 += Val(ass1_listbox.Items.Item(x).ToString + ass2_listbox.Items.Item(x).ToString) Next ListBox2.Items.Add((sum1.ToString) * 100 / TextBox1.Text) I would assume this is because me not understanding how strings and exact works. 
I generally don't recommend buying any books that are language specific like that (many are poor quality, and will be outdated pretty quickly), but if you absolutely have to have a book then the Sams VB in 24 hours book would be the one that I'd chose out of those 2 (but there are probably better books available). Personally, I'd start with the VB Fundamentals course on Virtual Academy, and then go from there. https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/visual-basic-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16507?l=MuImoTKbC_3706218965 
A form-level variable is basically a variable declared at, well, form-level: anywhere between "Public Class Form1" and "End Class", while remaining outside any functions. You'll need to declare two such variables: one to store the first value, and the second as a boolean to let you know if this is the first or second click. Tell you what. If you can write the logic required for steps 1 to 5 in pseudo-code (you can use Java even!), I'll give you the exact VB code you need for this program. Deal? ;)
Syntax error: you want Dim clicktest as Boolean = False 
This. Alternatively: Label1.Caption &amp;= vbNewLine &amp; Textbox1.Text 
Cheers for he help I try this later
No problem. Good luck.
Cheers for explanation 
You can elevate UAC during runtime at any point. Say a user wants to deal with a directory protected by Windows and needs elevated permissions. Instead of just launching it as an administrator or forcing it to launch as an administrator you just elevate for that task. There is a sample on MSDN. But that was just an example. But until he actually says what he wants to do it would be far easier to just do it at before runtime, on startup, or create an elevated service that will do it as well.
So here is what I am trying to achieve: My team sets machines up for the users we support. This includes application installs, user settings changes, etc. I'm trying to automate at least some of that process. This requires though that some of those steps are run under admin context (copying files to a folder in the Program Files directory for instance) and some steps run under the local user context, like inserting keys into the Current User hive. In Powershell, I would accomplish this by defining a function that captures and stores the credentials of someone with admin rights in a PSCredential object (containing a username property and a password property that is stored as a securestring). I could then pass that object as the argument to the RunAs verb in a start-process cmdlet (system.diagnostics.processstartinfo()) block. I'm wondering if the same is possible in vbnet: collecting credentials once and then passing them as arguments later.
You're saying though, elevate at launch, and then impersonate the current user for the individual tasks that require it? That seems more elegant than what I feel like I'm currently trying to do.
Agreed, and it feels like accomplishing the task "the way it was designed" rather then hacking something else together.
A more important question is why is the SQL Server not running?
Have you looked in the Services menu or the Logs to see why the service is stopping to begin with?
This is a workaround, not a solution. Find out why your SQL service keeps crashing, and fix that. To answer you question, though, service restarting can be done with either. I wrote something similar to restart services on client machines when a vendor made it clear that they weren't going to fix the issue in their software. However, it sounds like you want the program to monitor and restart the service when it fails automatically, which rules out using a batch file. With that consideration, I'll focus on how to do it with VB.NET. First, you'll want to setup a function that simply checks the status of the service. To do this, you'll need to declare a new ServiceController object. Dim sc as New ServiceController Next, you'll need to point this to the service on the other machine. To do this, use the static method of ServiceController called .GetServices() to populate an array with the services from the other machine, and then loop through them to find the correct one. Once it is found, set your sc variable equal to it. Dim services() as servicecontroller = servicecontroller.getservices({computer name}) For each service in services if service.displayname = {service name} then sc = service end if (Be sure to replace {computer name} and {service name} with the appropriate values) So, at this point, you should have a function/sub that looks something like this: Private Sub CheckService() Dim sc as new ServiceController Dim services() as servicecontroller = servicecontroller.getservices({computer name}) For each service in services if service.displayname = {service name} then sc = service end if Next End Sub For the sake of time and simplicity, we'll go ahead and check the service status here and reset if needed. Both of these things can be done with our new sc object: Private Sub CheckService() Dim sc as new ServiceController Dim services() as servicecontroller = servicecontroller.getservices({computer name}) For each service in services if service.displayname = {service name} then sc = service end if Next if sc.status.toString() &lt;&gt; "Running" then Try sc.Start() sc.WaitForStatus(ServiceControllerStatus.Running) Catch ex as exception msgbox(ex.message) End Try End Sub Next we throw in a timer with this function as its tick handler: Public Class Form1 Dim ti as new Timers.Timer({interval in milliseconds}) Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load AddHandler ti.Elapsed, AddressOf CheckService ti.start() End Sub Private Sub CheckService() Dim sc as new ServiceController Dim services() as servicecontroller = servicecontroller.getservices({computer name}) For each service in services if service.displayname = {service name} then sc = service end if Next if sc.status.toString() &lt;&gt; "Running" then Try sc.Start() sc.WaitForStatus(ServiceControllerStatus.Running) Catch ex as exception msgbox(ex.message) End Try End Sub End Class Now all that is left is to add any window dressings you want for the feedback form. So, it occurred to me midway through writing this that the service could still be 'Running', but not responding (ie. frozen instead of crashed). If that is the case, you'll need to try to connect to the database instead of checking the service status, and restart based on the result of that. Let me know if this is the case and you need help. Edit: fixed code
Make sure you are using the text property of each text box. 
what do you mean can you please clarify, if i uploaded the project would you help me correct my mistake!?
The error is telling you exactly what the issue is. The value from the text property is a string and you are trying to divide a string by an integer. You will need to cast each value from the text box to a decimal value. I am sure your textbook for your class will have all of this information. 
nope, our teacher gave us this as homework, and he didnt give us any info for helping us?!
Have a google and read some documentation on Int32.TryParse (providing your exam scores are integers of course)
step1: format the code, or use a pastebin. step2: describe the actual problem you're having.
&gt;Is this something that can be done? Yes.
Thanks! Will I be able to get it to write to disk? Edit: I'm sorry I want to clarify. Will I be able to get the recipes that she adds to be stored some where and automatically added to the Generate grocery list page?
of course. there's probably a dozen apps in the windows store that already that do those things, and 100 more shareware ones. but writing your own will be a great way to become familiar with VB. go for it.
Hey! Thanks for the encouragement! When I make some progress Ill be sure to share it with you guys
Even easier would be to serialize a collection of objects out to a .dat file, then just load the objects back in from that. No need for parsing. Here's an example from a game I made. It serializes a collection of 'Player' objects, but it can easily be modified to store recipes: &lt;System.Serializable()&gt; Public Class Player Property Name As String Property Sessions As New List(Of Session) Property Defaults As New GameOptions Property HighScore As Integer Public Sub New(ByVal Nm As String, Optional ByVal Options As GameOptions = Nothing) Name = Nm Defaults = Options End Sub End Class &lt;System.Serializable()&gt; Public Class Game Property Players As New List(Of Player) Public Sub Save(ByVal g As Game) Dim fs As FileStream = New FileStream("players.dat", FileMode.OpenOrCreate) Dim bf As New BinaryFormatter bf.Serialize(fs, g) fs.Close() End Sub Public Function Load() Dim bf As New BinaryFormatter Dim fsread As New FileStream("players.dat", FileMode.Open) Dim retValue As Object = bf.Deserialize(fsread) fsread.Close() Return retValue End Function End Class
In your loop. Dim strButtonName As String = "b" &amp; I Dim buttonToRemove as Control = me.controls(strButtonName) me.controls.remove(buttonToRemove) buttonToRemove.dispose() buttonToRemove = nothing 
Ah, I made something like this before. A very dirty way of doing it would be by making a variable called Score and Question. Load the first question and once the next button is hit do this... Pseudo code If question = 1 then If checkbox# is checked then Score =+1 End if ElseIf question = 2 then If checkbox# is checked then Score =+1 End if You just need to keep beating the if statements. I know it sounds confusing but I wish I had my project, would have linked it for you to use the source.
So That would be separate to the IF statement I already have in, but it would stay in the Button sub, right? Thanks for the reply! (Also if this is badly written it's because I haven't been writing it for long)
I haven't checked you code due to data restrictions but I know exactly what you're trying to do.
Might be best to include, in the radiobox click event, a method that disables the other equivalent radioboxes across the board. So say the user clicks on the first value for Strength, all other first values are deselected and then disabled. It's more troublesome to explain than it is to do. If you like, send me the file, I'll write the code for you, and then send it back.
You might be better off validating at the end. If the user assigns the 18 to str and then changes their mind, they might not be able to unselect 18 if all the other values become locked due to being selected elsewhere. Maybe if you select something else, say 12, the characteristic currently 12 becomes 18. Or am I totally misunderstanding this?
I'll try to explain. If someone hits an 18, I would want it to deselect any other 18s, basically. I thought about disabling the other buttons linked to the 18, but I decided against it. One thing I'm struggling with is how I can get it to update more often. I'm just starting out with VB (week 3 of my class), so my knowledge is very limited. The only way I know of to get the program to run the code I want (without a specific button) is with the ".checkedchanged" property, but if that specific radio button isn't being used, the rest of the code doesn't run. So I'd have to individually program each button to do it how I want, which would take forever and would be a mess of code. Is there a way to get an event to trigger when the selection in the group box is changed? I could probably get it working with a lot less headache if I could run the code from that event. 
No problem. I'll leave actually grabbing the selected stat values and doing something useful with them as an exercise for you. ;) Here's a tip: there's no need to check each groupbox for the selected radiobutton. Instead, you can piggyback off the click event already created. 
I know you said it works, but consider if you can reuse the controls instead. Creating and deleting controls is computationally expensive, and if they're going to be the same buttons - just hooked up to different innards - reusing the controls should be just as simple. Just a thought. :)
Seems like it would be cleanest to turn the address into its own type (with its own equality logic) and then use `student.Address.Equals(otherStudent.Address)`. That would involve some refactoring, of course. It's possible to do this with reflection (and with dynamic code generation the performance impact would be manageable), but I'm not sure if this would actually be less work, especially when you still need to manually define which properties matter for the desired equality comparison. If you're looking for shorter code, perhaps you could use a helper method like Public Shared Function Equals(Of T)(obj1 as T, obj2 as T, ParamArray getters() as Func(Of T, Object)) As Boolean If obj1 Is Nothing Then Return obj2 Is Nothing If obj2 Is Nothing Then Return obj1 Is Nothing For Each getter in getters If Not Object.Equals(getter(obj1), getter(obj2)) Then Return False Next Return True End Function Public Function AddressEquals(other As Student) As Boolean Return Equals(Me, other, Function(s) s.AddressType, Function(s) s.Street, ' ... ) End Function (this will cause some boxing and be slightly slower, but eh) 
Following the directions in the error console or debugging is easy too... We don't know your error, we don't even know what you're trying to achieve other than adding numbers. Do you expect us to type your code ourselves and do it for you? I don't mean to rub off as rude but this is comparable to telling us your car isn't running and not listing what it's doing. I (or we) can help if you give us a description, that's the way it works here. We don't get paid for this. :)
I'll give you an upvote seeing how people around here don't know how to upvote others hard work.
Do I replace the "Upperbound", "Lowerbound" and "Rnd" with numbers? 
Pretty confused (I'm really new to VB). So what exactly would be the code to generate a random number from 1 to 3? Would it just be Msgbox Random(1,3) ?
The code itself to generate the number is just `Random(1,3)` `Msgbox` only displays the output of `Random(1,3)` in an easy to see popup. The numbers within the parenthesis are called arguments or parameters. They are used by the function to determine what numbers to generate. As you guessed, Lowerbound and Upperbound are substituted with whatever numbers you define. The function will then generate a random number that falls on and between the two numbers.
reddit's VB sub isn't all that high in terms of traffic. You could certainly post your questions here, but you could also try vbforums.com, which is a forum site dedicated specifically to Visual Basic.
In this case, your textboxes are shadowed by your local variables as they have the same name. This means that you're trying to access `Decimal.Text` (of the local variables) instead of `Textbox.Text` (of the form objects). As you have seen, the Decimal object does not have .Text and produces a compiler error. Assuming that your textboxes are named the same as the local variables, you can either rename the local variables or rename the object names (just don't do both at once or you will get the same error). Alternatively, you can access the textbox text using `FormName.TextboxName.Text`. The first way is probably better. 
Thank you Reddit for all your help I have figured it out here is the code for proof! Private Sub calcBtn_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles calcBtn.Click Dim score1 As Decimal Dim score2 As Decimal Dim score3 As Decimal Dim score4 As Decimal Dim score5 As Decimal score1 = CDec(assignment1txt.Text) score2 = CDec(assignment2txt.Text) score3 = CDec(assignment3txt.Text) score4 = CDec(assignment4txt.Text) score5 = CDec(assignment5txt.Text) totalscoretxt.Text = (score1 + score2 + score3 + score4 + score5) MessageBox.Show("your total score is " &amp; totalscoretxt.Text &amp; "!")
What are you trying to clear and print? I don't think you provided enough info on the assignment to be able to help point you in the right direction.

"Mother’s Day is celebrated in Canada on the second Sunday of May each year." You should be able to calculate the date with that piece of information.
You could use a listbox to list the various drives, then use multiselect to be able to select whichever drives you'd like. This allows you to support however many drives your computer may have, and also makes it easier to identify which one is which: `Listbox1.Items.AddRange(My.Computer.FileSystem.Drives.ToArray)`
I think his problem is properly setting the Label.Text value to his answer, if you look at his picture, OP has labels where the answer will go., but doesn't properly assign the value on the cmdCalculate_Click() from what I see above. unless of course I'm totally off and OP is trying to do something else completely... 
i know this is a homework sort of question but i have come to the point where i'm asking my own mother for help xD
write a program to convert teaspoons to cups, tablespoon and the teaspoons left over. Have the user enter the number of teaspoons in a textbox. Convert the teaspoons to cups, tablespoons and teaspoons left over. Declare as constants, the number of teaspoons in a cup (48) and the number of teaspoons in a tablespoon (3). Display your results in a listbox:
Const tablespoonsPercup As Integer = 3 Const teaspoonsPercup As Integer = 48 Dim Cup As Integer Dim Tablespoon As Integer Dim Teaspoon As Integer Dim Totalcup As Integer Dim ConvertBucket As Integer 'Input section TotalCups = CInt(txtTotalCups.Text) 'Calculations ConvertBucket = TotalCups Tablespoon = ConvertBucket \ tablespoonPercup ConvertBucket = ConvertBucket Mod tablespoonPercup Teaspoon = ConvertBucket \ teaspoonPercup NumInches = ConvertBucket Mod teaspoonPercup ' Output Section lstResults.Items.Clear() lstResults.Items.Add("Cups = " &amp; Cups) lstResults.Items.Add("Tablespoons = " &amp; Tablespoons) lstResults.Items.Add("Teaspoon = " &amp; Teaspoons) End Sub

Thanks /u/Bonejob and u/ViperSRT3g! I ended up using a CheckedListBox control and greatly reduced the code. [Here is the new UI](https://i.imgur.com/6FzunpZ.png) This is the code that populates the CheckedListBox (lstDrives) with only removable (USB) drives: Private Sub GetDrives() Dim drives() As System.IO.DriveInfo = System.IO.DriveInfo.GetDrives For Each drive In drives Dim driveName As String = drive.Name Dim driveType As System.IO.DriveType = drive.DriveType If driveType = System.IO.DriveType.Removable Then lstDrives.Items.Add(driveName) Next End Sub This is the code that does the copying: Private Sub CopyToDrives() For i = 0 To lstDrives.Items.Count If lstDrives.GetItemChecked(i) Then My.Computer.FileSystem.CopyDirectory(txtSourceDir.Text, lstDrives.Items.Item(i), True) If chkLabel.Checked Then ChangeVolumeLabel(lstDrives.Items.Item(i), txtLabel.Text) End If Next End Sub Also, in the command button that starts the copying, I do some checking to make sure the source directory is valid, as well as making sure that the listbox is populated and at least one drive is checked: If Not My.Computer.FileSystem.DirectoryExists(txtSourceDir.Text) Then cmdExecute.Enabled = True MsgBox("Please select a valid source directory.") Exit Sub End If Dim intDrives as Integer = 0 Dim x As Integer = 0 If lstDrives.Items.Count = 0 Then MsgBox("Please select at least one destination drive.") Exit Sub End If Do While (intDrives &lt; lstDrives.Items.Count) If lstDrives.GetItemChecked(intDrives) Then x = x + 1 intDrives = intDrives + 1 Loop If x = 0 Then MsgBox("Please select at least one destination drive.") Exit Sub End If
and how would i do this?? you mean do a for loop 1-4 times? then if there are 2 or more "yes votes" it will display the message its supposed to?
i'm not too sure how to make it so that if there are 2 or more "yes" votes from the judges then .. example: Well done rebel, the judges thought you were good enough to get through this round, you have received 3 yes votes and only 1 no vote!
thanks bro :*
You are trying to write C# in a VBS script. It needs to be Visual Basic. To some extent that's just a matter of removing the semicolons but you'll also have to rewrite the "for" loop in VB syntax.
VB provides the goto command as a reminder to NEVER EVER USE IT. Seriously though, it is just a leftover from legacy VB coding to keep syntax compatible, but there is not one single case where a goto should be used in modern VB.NET programming versus the alternatives.
No doubt, but even a beginner should not start off learning bad habits. Just because you can do something in code does not mean you should do something in code. GOTO statements are an example of this. They are valid syntax and will work as intended and indeed to go the line specified. However they make code analysis very difficult, and create spaghetti code that is hard to follow and maintain. That is all.
Nothing came up for that. There is no sub-thing of Math. that seems to provide randomization. For reference, using Visual Studio 2016. Don't know if this was a thing in earlier editions. 
Going old school because everybody used the other ways :) randomize() dim val as integer = cint(int(20*rnd()+1)) this was a pretty simple google dude...
Don't have any VBScript experience, but I'd check that you are running the script from task scheduler with the same desktop user that it works from on the desktop. If it's being run from an admin account, or some other account that doesn't have Outlook installed on it, it may not be able to find the Outlook instance. 
Clear button would be a series of these. textbox1.text = "" textbox2.text = "" Exit button would be something like. Me.close() These would go in the click event of the button. I'll let you figure out the math and formatting stuff on your own. Hint: use Google this is easy stuff.
Everything until calculate savings savings
It's 256 characters that may be the problem. I'll look into it some more. It's weird because I've captured other exceptions but they are of the type System.IO.PathTooLongException which is pretty self explanatory. It's possible those were being thrown in a different part of my code which may explain why the exception is different depending on what object I'm using. BTW It does start with a \\ must have just missed the first \ when using copy &amp; paste.
maybe reddit escaped out the double slash?
Do you have any idea what the work flow would be? No one here is going to do your homework for you, but if you at least show some work we can give better advice 
i know i first need to set up the three variables for them to give values for. id probably use singles and then i figure you put their values into the quadratic equations to get your roots. and the display the roots. but the possibilities of unreal/imaginary numbers have me worried. its just that my teacher has taught us next to nothing. in my whole class i have the most programming experience and im just not sure how to make vba do what i want.
The application isn't where you are checking cells, you need to look into the workbook and worksheets before the cells
You might need to resort to torrents unfortunately. http://nuke.vbcorner.net/Articles/VB60/VisualStudio6Installer/tabid/93/language/en-US/Default.aspx has an installer, but you need to supply the discs We have one setup disc at our company, but sharing it is off limits for me Im afraid. 
Got any torrent links which don't need discs or anything?
Not going to post direct links, but the Bay of the Pirates has a hit with "Microsoft Visual Basic v6.0 Professional" and "Visual Basic 6.0 Enterprise Edition[A4]" :) I think you can use both of those with that installer I mentioned. The reason you need/should use the installer is because vb6 isnt that compatible with windows7 and up without some modifications, which the installer automatically applies.

Is it really that bad? We're just learning VB6 for some exam though.
It's definitely happening in code, or you wouldn't get the error message. You can check the 'Break when this exception type is thrown" checkbox on the error screen, and you'll get an in app exception handler. Based on the screenshot, it's happening in some event that is trying to cast the mouseEventArgs into a toolStripItemClickedEventArgs. I'd guess that it's either a mouse_click event, or a Toolstripmenu_click event, where you are trying to pass the "e" argument as the wrong type. I'm sure that seeing the code from the button click would help. 
that code makes my brain hurt.
It is pretty clear you have a bad event handler routine wired up there to your tool strip button click events.
The videos in that link are for Visual Basic .NET, and will be pretty useless for VBA. VBA (Visual Basic For Applications) is a completely different language, with a completely different IDE. You'll probably find more useful information over at /r/vba 
Let's just call it a subset language. Saying it is completely different is not really true, when I would say there is about 80% overlap in syntax and keywords. I totally agree with you that reading a book about .NET will leave you confused in VBA, but that is more to do with the capabilities of the 2 runtimes each language uses.
 Public Function ParseUnicodeId(id As String) As String If id Is Nothing Then Throw New ArgumentNullException("id") If id.StartsWith("U+", StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase) Then id = id.Substring(2) End If Dim numeric = Int32.Parse(id, NumberStyles.HexNumber) Dim bytes = BitConverter.GetBytes(numeric) Dim result = Encoding.UTF32.GetString(bytes) Return result End Function I *think* this works fine, but I'm not 100% if there are edge cases where it doesn't.
That has worked spot on. Thank you for your quick response! Encoding is all a bit new to me.

I'm going to be honest with you. I'm kind of new to Visual Basic, so I don't really know all that much about it (this project is for school).

If btnDone is an actual button (not a toolStripMenuItem) then the signature for the btnDone_Click event is wrong. It should look like this: Private Sub btnDone_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnDone.Click 
That's not the way to do the math for the label in button click, there are a host of other small things, but that's your major problem, learn to use the debugger to see where things go bad
Create 3 windows that look like your pictures, first window button opens second window, button in second window does math and passes value to third window, that should get you started
I don't know why you set single and double multiple times, your textboxes won't error check strings, your variable names aren't great, you should disable a radio on a different radio click, what happens when you click both? There are lots of small things that should be ironed out, pretend you're absolutely stupid and don't know how to use computers, then try your form in every conceivable manner and see what happens
Nor did I! It looks super helpful for arbitrary lengths of pre/suffixes on strings.
if you change the forecolor, the Emoji remains black?
or the problem is that it uses only one color? 
Would I keep the If statement in the groupbox I have with the to radio buttons or should i remove those entirely?
Okay, so color fonts are supported in [DirectWrite](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh802480(v=vs.85\).aspx), which can be used in WinForms applications with some effort, e.g. with [SharpDX](http://sharpdx.org). I have virtually no knowledge of DirectX, but I've been able to get the SharpDX [hello world sample](https://github.com/sharpdx/SharpDX-Samples/tree/master/Desktop/DirectWrite/SimpleHelloWorld) to render colored emojis with a minor change in [Line 60](https://github.com/sharpdx/SharpDX-Samples/blob/master/Desktop/DirectWrite/SimpleHelloWorld/Program.cs#L60): RenderTarget2D.DrawText("😃 😄 😅 😆 😇", TextFormat, ClientRectangle, SceneColorBrush, DrawTextOptions.EnableColorFont);
I suppose you're specifically mentioning VB 2012 because the *MyProgrammingLab* thing only deals with it. TBH, you might as well just use the latest visual studio as they don't differ much overall. Do you have any particular goal in mind? Any programming project to aim for as a first project?
there's a ton of tutorials out there, including youtube ones, but most probably aren't going to do a lot more than what you're already using. is there something specific you need more explanation on? MSDN's reference usually has really good explanations, and stackoverflow has some interesting discussions (don't just take the top answer for golden though, you can learn a lot reading the whole thread) you need to work on your reading-learning skills though. all programming docs are text only, and if you can't glean info from that, you're gonna have a bad time. you are never ever going to know in your head everything about VB or programming, there's just too much of it. you are always going to have to use reference manuals, for your whole life. Plus, vb2012 is already old, and while 2015 isn't that much different, it is different. and 2015 is very different than 2005, so expect to do a significant amount of re-learning every 10 years at the greatest. 
I usualy point people to [Visual Basic for Absolute Beginners](http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Visual-Basic-Development-for-Absolute-Beginners). I would alos suggest that using visual studio 2015 will work for what you need.
Have fun coding 
To put it simply, this is not VB at all. This is C.
So odd it almost seems like a troll post...
It's almost like they're trying to find the clueless, or the ones to convert the code over to VB for them.
it's certainly a skill that'll take practice.
The reason you aren't getting much help here is that YOU have to do some work. Start the project, write some code...try to do it yourself, then - if it doesn't work correctly - ask for some assistance. If this project is that far above your skill level, then you need to start somewhere more basic. 
Those should only be toggling each other off when you select one, as not to have conflicting options selected. They should be evaluated in the routine that is meant to output the number of rolls they need. 
Those classes are not marked as serializable and don't have writable properties, so you will not be able to serialize them with the built in serializers. You could attempt to use a third-party serializer that does not require attributes (e.g. protobuf-net), but I suspect this would be a lot of trouble due to the large number of underlying and internal types involved. I think your best bet would be to extract all the information you need from the `DirectorySecurity` object after reading it, create a custom class to hold that data and serialize that instead.
That's what I was afraid of. I guess I'll head down that road because the only information I really need are the groups and users that have permissions and what those permissions are. That should not be too hard to convert to another custom class.
The `And` operator has higher [precedence](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fw84t893.aspx) than the `Or` operator, meaning it is evaluated first. So your condition reads as a Or b Or c Or d Or (e And f) when you actually want (a Or b Or c Or d Or e) And f You can solve this by placing them in parentheses which are evaluated first (just as in math), but perhaps it would make your code more readable if you create a separate "at least one ticket selected" variable or something. Also, it seems to me that the discount would be incorrectly determined if someone was to check a checkbox but enter 0 as the quantity.
whether or not LIKE is case sensitive depends on your DB engine. the [] implies mssql or access, mssql is not, I haven't used access is forever and don't recall if it is. ADO just builds up and submits the query, you can use mssql's profiler to see what gets sent, I don't know if there's a way to do that on access.
I'm using Excel as the data source here though. And yes, SQL is not case sensitive when it comes to querying (unless there's a collation).
Might want to try /r/VBA instead
Without seeing the full block it's tough to tell. Seems to be writing an HTML table row for each item in a recordset. The for/next loop doesn't make sense to me as it's utilizing only the last assigned values for neither color or style variables. Edit: missed the last paragraph of your post. The Green condition will be set off in the event svccd ends with 'N'.
instead of dropping an abbreviated text bomb, spell it out, and you're halfway there. it's basically a math problem. if you can do the math, you can write the code.
Lol I just noticed the "questing" in the side bat &gt;.&lt;
I'm not asking you to do it for me maybe you misread I just would like some advice to doing this question
I thought maybe that is how it worked but I wasn't sure...obviously. So no matter how long it is, it only cares if the last letter is 'N", then? What does the "i" part of right(svccd(i),1) do? Thanks so much for your feedback.
I already know a great deal about the study system, including values for certain parameters. For example, I know that on average 14% of butterflies from each population migrate. I know that for the most part no female remains unmated. I know mortality rates etc etc. In essence, I've already done the job of writing an essay on what happens on a year long iteration. I just have no idea how to translate that into code. So my question becomes, what topics in the field of visual basic do I need to learn in order to be able to translate effectively? you are correct about individual level interactions. Those are not details I will be delving into. Cheers for your reply btw! As I said I'm really not looking for someone to do my work, moreso someone to tell me how to learn to do it myself :s!
Thanks a great deal for your responses. I see what you mean, unfortunately I won't really know what is going into the full model for a while. This is something which needs to be discussed between myself and my supervisor. I'm happy you mention OOP, as thus far that seems to be the only topic I can find that seems relevant to me past the fundamentals. I'll continue working on these tutorials for a while. Again, thanks for your help.
odd that its paying attention to the extension. try renaming it to `.vbs` Also, VBScript doesn't use modules or `Sub Main`, the execution simply starts from line 1. So take the (end) module and sub lines out. I don't know any basic that uses `System.console.write `but the equivalent would simply be `WScript.Echo` and all your other `system.` classes and functions (formatcurrency?) are not part of VB, whatever parent script or cousin module has those defined you can find a built-in counterpart in VB itsself
I think I might be able to help you here. But I'm not going to use the XmlReader you used so far in your code simply because I never really used it. [Here](http://pastebin.com/mm690apu) you can find how I would solve the problem. It should work but because I'm limited to VisualStudio Code on this device I can't test it. Also because the code you posted wasn't exactly helpful when it comes to meaningful names I just used example names instead so you would have to edit it to your needs to actually use it. Hope it helps. If you have any questions about it feel free to ask. 
Hey there, thanks for the help though I try to load the XML it gives an error on this line For Each item As XmlElement In xmlFile.SelectSingleNode("/SurfaceTypes/") Here is a copy of the error: http://pastebin.com/WtLTPywS Edit: I managed to fix it, thank you so much.
Why are you trying to compile in the command line instead of using Visual Studio? 
Port 57153 is in the range of available open port. Error 425 may be returned to an FTP client if the server is unable to open a socket for data transfer. This usually occurs when you connect initially and the call back from the ftp server specifies a port and your local can not implement the port. My guess is the firewall. Turn it off see if it works then. 
So in this textbook you have, maybe somewhere in the pages prior to the one this assignment is on, there is maybe information on how to code in Visual Basic that teaches the skills needed to do the assignment? Or is this assignment on page 1?
assuming your json looks like {foo:'bar', baz:99} just wrap it in another layer like {root:{foo:'bar', baz:99}} and there you can easily see why json is both more flexible AND more readable than XML. and if you're using a library, to covert either to a native object, why does make a lick a of different which you use? you're just creating a lot of work to skip some minimal learning curve.
You can adjust this to suit your needs. (I used a trackbar with a min value of 0, and a max value of 20000) Private Function LogSlider(ByVal SlideValue As Integer) As Long Dim minp As Long = 0 'Input Value Lowerbound Dim maxp As Long = 20000 'Input Value Upperbound Dim minv As Double = Math.Log(1) 'Output Lowerbound Dim maxv As Double = Math.Log(20000) 'Output Upperbound Dim scale As Double = (maxv - minv) / (maxp - minp) Return Math.Round(Math.Exp(minv + scale * (SlideValue - minp)), 0) End Function [^Code ^converted ^from ^**StackOverflow**](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/846221/logarithmic-slider)
 Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click PictureBox1.Visible = Not PictureBox1.Visible End Sub
thanks!
So which part are you stuck at?
You should use `Contains` instead of `IndexOf`, makes it more readable and clear what's going on. And there's basically never a reason to use ` = True`. Regarding the logic, it seems to me that there are some redundancies in the conditions: If you match anything containing "ANTILLES" anyway, "NETHERLANDS ANTILLES" would of course also be covered and doesn't need a separate check. And since the first `ElseIf` captures any string containing "ANTILLES", checking for it in the second `ElseIf` is pointless since such a string would never reach it. This is the sort of stuff that [regular expressions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hs600312.aspx) are pretty good at, if you don't mind learning how to use them.
Thank you, this is what I did based on your suggestion: ElseIf _folder.Contains("d.r. congo") = True OrElse (_folder.Contains("democratic") = True And _folder.Contains("republic") = True And _folder.Contains("congo") = True) = True Then Return "D.R. Congo" ElseIf _folder.Contains("korea") = True AndAlso _folder.Contains("north korea") = True Then Return "North Korea" ElseIf _folder.Contains("south korea") = True OrElse _folder.Contains("korea") = True AndAlso Not _folder.Contains("north korea") = True Then Return "South Korea" May I just confirm on the code below, if _folder has "Niger", it won't return Nigeria, but it will return Niger. And vice versa? When it returns the value, it will no longer check the other conditions right (ie: given _folder = "Niger", it won't check if _folder = "Nigeria")? ElseIf _folder.Contains("nigeria") = True Then Return "Nigeria" ElseIf _folder.Contains("niger") = True Then Return "Niger"
Thanks for the advice for the scrolling image what code would I need to put in to get it work
Thank you! Looks like that's how I'm going to have to do it then.
thanks so much!
random sort an array and then just loop through it.
Use the [Rnd()](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f7s023d2.aspx) function, which returns a float between 0 and just less than 1. Multiply it by 20 so the results are between 0 and just less than 20 instead (for convenience). Use [Randomize()](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8zedbtdt.aspx) first to initialize the random number generator with a new seed or you'll just get the same numbers every game. Then use a case statement to pick the shape depending on what Rnd() * 20 returns. Randomize() Select Case Rnd() * 20 Case Is &lt;1: ' Shape 1 Case Is &lt;2: ' Shape 2 Case Is &lt;3: ' Shape 3 ' ... and so on Case Is &lt;19: ' Shape 19 Case Else: ' Shape 20 End Select More info on [MSDN Rnd() function](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f7s023d2.aspx) and [MSDN Randomize() function](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8zedbtdt.aspx).
This is correct, but a far easier way to do this would be to store all your shapes in an array and then just grab a random value from said array. Dim shapes as Shape() = {shape1, shape2, ... shape20} Dim roll as integer = rnd()*20 Dim chosenShape = shapes(roll) 
chosenShape.top should work. Maybe paste your full code so that we can have a look?
Dim shapes shapes = Array(Shape1, shape2, Shape3) Randomize Dim choose Randomize choose = shapes(Rnd() * 2) choose.Top = choose.Top + 10
What type of class does Shape1 etc belong to?
Well, if you have any questions about what you're working on, feel free to ask! (Ignore the downvotes here as it seems to be a common problem for some reason) You'll still be learning by asking.
I would check in the F12 Developertools on the network tab if i can find out how the data is retrieved by the webpage. Then you could emulate the post to get it. But this depends on what exactly you are interested. If the data is processed on clientside this approach wont work
the webbrowser control is the same core that IE is built on, it's not actually IE. I believe there are also webkit and gecko options out there, but you'll need to install them. you could also just open a TCP socket and parse out the page if you don't need to render it to the user

are you looking for actual accurate distances, or you have some sort of set paths? if accurate, you'd want to implement something like http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html and the array would hold your locations coords
I dont really need accurate distances but something realistic enough to use to use in the cost calculations. So the actual distance from Seattle to San Francisco is 807 miles, I'm fine with just 800 miles. I'm just trying to figure out when the user selects a location in each dropdownlist, how would I code it to calculate the difference in distance based on the selected locations for any combo.
you can do lat-lon calcs, or you can make a big array with every combination of locations and their distances. or come with some crazy path finding algorithm on know distance paths.
The file reads this Samuel,Alito,George W. Bush,NJ,2006,0 and I need it to rewrtie this Samuel,Alito,NJ 
Store the list of files in the directory in an array of some sort, then clear and re-add the files to the combobox.
Sounds like your directory info from the source is cached. I would have to see you code for more detailed response. 
This has nothing to do with `String.IsNullOrEmpty`, the code never even gets that far. The issue lies with Value.ToString If `value` is null, calling its `ToString()` method will obviously result in an NRE. 
You're the man I had a feeling it was something obvious that I was overlooking. Thanks I got it working now.
Remove "Dim" and "As Label" from the line with the blue squigglies. That will eliminate the compiler error. Then you just have to figure out how to get the radius from the user, and you need to use the right formula for the area of a circle (pi * radius * radius).
I just realized there's a typo in that sentence. &gt; Homework questions are tolerated, please be specific about the **questing** as much a possible. Asking us to write it for you is not going to happen.
I feel the reason no one has answered your question, is because everyone else is wondering the same thing: **Why are you opening a website in the background like this?**
what I'd try first is after replacing with : pad out the rest so there is always 4 elements, then split. or split and conditionally pull the elements to the vars based on how many there are. then you can multiply the first by 24 and add it to the 2nd, then build h:m:s. the problem in current logic is that you're assuming the first is always days and it isn't. I also don't see any reason for those loops given your sample data. 
Yes it's homework, I know it's probably the worst thing possible but it's what I've been told to do and I'm mega stuck on it :P Edit: Yes I don't expect you to write it for me, if someone could send me I the right direction that would be great I tried doing 2 For Loops which went through the array (hard to explain) but I'm pretty much dry from that point 
Why not show us the code you have so far, so we can tell you where you went wrong?
Yeh, if I follow that to to letter it works, but when I try to use "tel" it just gets overrode by some other setting. I get the box asking which application I want to use. No option of choosing one not listed.
So looking at the code, where do you calculate packagecost? Also the totalcost calculation in the &gt;20 licences, I don't think the math is right. Without running the code, I can't be sure tho.
Connecting to databases is similar no matter what connection type . There are a few different connection methods. Start with this video.

Since this is not "homework" as in an assignment to be handed in I will provide a more complete solution. Your input sentence is "Hello my name is Hello". You want the output to be a single line with each word being surrounded by quotes and within the quotes the number of the position in the sentence starting at zero with a ; between each variable in the output. I would start by using the [Split](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b873y76a.aspx) function to break it up into the individual words. I would then [Iterate](https://www.dotnetperls.com/for-vbnet) through the list and combine them into a single string. I choose not to use a [string builder](https://www.dotnetperls.com/stringbuilder-vbnet) for this and just concatenate on the fly. Here is a simple console app. Ask questions I will help where I can. Sub Main() dim str as string = "Hello my name is Hello" ' store string in var dim sVar() as string = str.split(" ") ' split it up dim assString = "" ' Heh! for x = 0 to svar.count -1 ' iterate from the first to the count of the total variables. -1 because we want to start at 0 instead of 1 assString = assString &amp; chr(34) &amp; svar(x) &amp; " " &amp; x &amp; chr(34) ' chr(34) is easier than """" if x &lt; svar.count -1 assstring = assstring &amp; " ; " ' if not the last variable add a ; End If Next console.writeline(assstring) console.readkey() ' output "Hello 0" ; "my 1" ; "name 2" ; "is 3"" ; "Hello 4" End Sub
bah use A* path finding for shortest route :P
you set numberLicenses = 0; twice in that code, so you might want to look at that...
Change all of the lines that look like this: Input1Contain = Input1Contain = -1 to this: Input1Contain = Input1Contain - 1 (i.e. remove the second equals sign) Edit: what's happening is, VB is treating "Input1Contain = -1" as a comparison. Since Input1Contain is not -1, this comparison evaluates to False. In VB, False as a number is 0. So you're essentially writing "Input1Contain = 0" in every Case in your Select.
yes, 5 is not &gt;5 so you won't get a V. and yes, it's case else.
Thanks I've made the changes, however I'm still only getting "X" as the output for 15 instead of "XV" Input1 = mtbFirstNumberInput.Text Input2 = mtbSecondNumberInput.Text Input1Contain = Input1 Input2Contain = Input2 While Input1Contain &gt; 0 Select Case Input1Contain Case Is &gt;= 1000 Input1Contain = Input1Contain - 1000 RomNum1Conv = RomNum1Conv + "M" Case Is &gt;= 500 Input1Contain = Input1Contain - 500 RomNum1Conv = RomNum1Conv + "D" Case Is &gt;= 100 Input1Contain = Input1Contain - 100 RomNum1Conv = RomNum1Conv + "C" Case Is &gt;= 50 Input1Contain = Input1Contain - 50 RomNum1Conv = RomNum1Conv + "L" Case Is &gt;= 10 Input1Contain = Input1Contain = -10 RomNum1Conv = RomNum1Conv + "X" Case Is &gt;= 5 Input1Contain = Input1Contain - 5 RomNum1Conv = RomNum1Conv + "V" Case Else Input1Contain = Input1Contain - 1 RomNum1Conv = RomNum1Conv + "I" End Select End While lblFirstNuminRN.Text = RomNum1Conv 
&gt; Input1Contain = Input1Contain = -10 you missed one
This?: Dim dt as Date = Now.Date MsgBox(dt.DayOfWeek.ToString) 
That may be it but i was trying to have the result of DateVl7 mod 7 be equal to the day of the week
With my given method, I've given you the chance not to hard-code the enitre thing like you did. With the help of Dim dt as Date = Now.Date MsgBox(dt.DaysInMonth([year],[month]) You should be able to modify your program appropiately.
Doing a loop in this case is quite useless and counter-productive since the only case it doesn't change the "grade0" to something other than 0, it issues a error message. Compare Strings with [String].toLower() and ask for Char.IsLetter() if needed
My goal was to have the select case repeat after doing the error console.write to give the user an attempt to re-enter an appropriate variable. My goal was to be creative, but I can probably get away with the assignment by just putting a user prompt at the beginning to only input the appropriate variable. 
Thanks, I'll try to incorporate that when I finish up the assignment.
A better way (since that is your question) might be to take advantage of the fact that the valid inputs (A, B, C, D and F) map to 4, 3, 2, 1 and 0: Dim grade = -1 ' set the grade to something invalid, we'll loop until it's valid Do Console.Writeline("Enter letter grade (A, B, C, D or F): ") Dim letter = Console.ReadLine.ToUpperInvariant ' we make the input uppercase here If letter.Length &lt;&gt; 1 Then Continue Do ' we make sure we got exactly one character grade = "FDCBA".IndexOf(letter) ' replaces the whole "SELECT CASE ... END SELECT" If grade &lt; 0 Then console.WriteLine("Invalid grade") Loop Until grade &gt; -1 Console.Writeline("Grade is " &amp; grade) I added a few comments to explain what's going on, but basically in the lines... Console.Writeline("Enter letter grade (A, B, C, D or F): ") Dim letter = Console.ReadLine.ToUpperInvariant If letter.Length &lt;&gt; 1 Then Continue Do ...we get our input, make it uppercase so we don't have to deal with a,b,c,d,f and make sure we got only one character of input so that an empty line or "abcd" will not be considered. Then, this line: grade = "FDCBA".IndexOf(letter) ...converts the entered letter into the correct grade. The "IndexOf" function returns the index (position) of the passed in letter. If it's not there, it returns -1 (our invalid value) so that the loop will continue. With "F" it returns 0, with "D" we get 1, and so on. After, if we don't have a correct grade, we scold the user and loop back for another go at it. 
If only I had more time... had a lot of fun getting the best VB.Net solution for "The Power of Thor" compact code (code golf) solution. Those 136 characters are the ugliest VB I've ever written.
136 chars wow... Did you need a separate guide to understand the two lines? :)
This should get you where you need to go http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36801384/how-exactly-do-i-create-a-multicolumn-listbox-in-visual-basic
my apologies for not getting back and giving a reply asap on you two, though already finished the project and found out what mistake I was making, I was using obj.CreateObject("Shell.Application") n.obj = ("FTP DIRECTORY") for each item in n.Items item.name next to update the data from the directory on the FTP server rather than using .Execute ("DIR") 
Glad you were able to get it fixed. 
It's okay, everyone starts out not knowing anything. The secret is to find the best way to phrase your question so we can steer you in the direction you want/need to go. Another hint, while I am here. When your code doesn't work, and there are still plenty of times mine does not, scale the code back until some of the steps work. Work with small pieces of code at a time. Add a line, run the code, if that works, add the next line, repeat. It'll save you a lot of frustration with; This code doesn't work! Where is the problem?
Understood. Thanks again for your help. I feel silly not know that I had to place it in-between an event. The code works like a dream!
for me its working well, no issues :-)
&gt;What am i doing wrong? The exception tells you what you're doing wrong: you're comparing a `DateTime` to a number. It's like asking "Does Christmas equal five?", it just logically doesn't make any sense.
You can use .NET DLLs in VB6 within certain limits if you do the work to make them COM visible, so that might be an option.
You looking to make a VB script file or a VB executable?
Impossible to answer without source and more context. "it messes everything up" is completely meaningless.
I was wondering, if there was a general reasoning behind looping backwards, but i think i found it. It is because i delete rows, and when i go forward, it messes up my count :)
Building new code in a .NET library is the way to go here IMO. That's how we migrated a very large VB6 project over the course of about 8 years. Added all new code to a set of .NET libraries, and migrated the other parts as we had time. Eventually we ran out of VB6 code, and it was just done. If you really want to develop it in VB6, you'll just have to [look at the API] (https://developers.google.com/drive/v2/reference/) and implement the various calls yourself. It appears that most of the API is based on HTTP GET, PUT, and POST methods, so googling how to do those with VB6 would be one direction to go (IIRC Winsock is the tool you'd use for that). 
I've always used sharp develop 4.4 for code conversion. I suppose I should start using something newer that understands the later additions to each language.
Exactly right! :) That's also the most common reason to use a For loop as opposed to a For-Next loop.
there's a few good reasons for that. removing elements from a queue inside the loop is one, another could be the source data is sorted descending and you want to process it ascending. looping back is more efficient than re-sorting. a better way to loop over a queue while removing items is a while loop, then you add to the end and remove from the front without issue.
Where do you live - I mean which country? 
In cases like this where I had very little control, and couldn't install the IDE, I would add a "DEBUG" command line switch to the app, and flag a global variable. Then I added a bunch of "If debug = true" areas where I would pop up a messagebox with some detail than I needed to see, or write values to a file, or some other method that allows you to pause and see what's happening. The nice thing about messageboxes is that you can use them as breakpoints. So you can output some data to a file, and then display the messagebox to stop the program while you check the data in the file, etc. You can also use them with simple markers to see where execution is going: Messagebox("Location 1"), MessageBox("routine 2"), etc. Then as you work through the app you can see what's happening and not happening, where branches are going, etc. It's a tedious way to do debugging, but sometimes you have to deal with this sort of thing. The nice thing about using a command line switch to accomplish this is that you can then remove the switch, and all of your code can stay put for later debugging. 
Ah, didn't think about that with the message boxes! I've been so far adding print statements but obviously no way of stopping progress. That'll be a huge bonus, thanks for that
My company's MSDN subscription includes QuickBasic 4.5 and DOS 6 so I'll bet there's VB6 as well. Not sure how much you have to pay to get access to that sort of thing.
Our visual studio wth msdn subscription that gets us all latest right back to vb6 is around 800 Aussie dollars.
as a design choice, it's usually best to avoid having a class directly modify the form text box, but instead return the value. other than that, you never said what the problem is...
Our users are local admins and UAC is turned off.

Thank you for your answer but... that went _way_ over my head. If I understood that right, one of the DLL files has a wrong function which only returns the very first device and the fix you linked tells me how to fix the DLL, right? I just manipulated the mentioned DLL file. Where do I have to put the fixed file for VS to find it? When I now start dhe project the DLL file is automatically overwritten and I only get the one device as I described above... How didn't Microsoft fix that DLL?
I just did that. I saved the fixed DLL, removed all references to both _PortableDevices*.dll_ from my project. Then I re-referenced the fixed DLL and the two others. The application can be executed without errors but returns the same result... I'm starting to suspect this approach is simply not the right one for Android devices.
how do i loop it?
ok, you are going to need to learn to search for information instead of having others do your homework. I know that sounds rude, but this is such a simple thing in any language. Dim sPhoneNumber As String = "123456" For b As Byte = 0 To sPhoneNumber.Length - 1 Dim sCurrentValue As String = sPhoneNumber.substring(b, 1) 'HERE IS WHERE YOUR SELECT CASE GOES 'SELECT CASE sCurrentValue 'Then add each select to the RETURN value Next
Firstly, thanks for your help! I know my code is a mess so thanks for taking the time to sift through it and make a reply, greatly appreciated! In terms of the code - I think I understand what you're talking about with the parent child problem, I'm not really familiar with the concept in implementation and even less so for Visual Basic specifically, but I can see that it's a very important concept that I have somehow only really skimmed over it so I'll be sure to familiarise myself with it. With my above explanation I've missed out sections of code which together with my lack of naming and *poor design* seems to have confused things, this seems important now. The code with btnQpounder is actually form3 and I use Hide() to move on from form1 as opposed to Close(), does that change anything? My idea was to work like: -form1 *Click button to begin transaction* /Hides, moves to Form2/ -form2 *Click button to go to food category (in this case burgers, so form3)* /Closes, moves to form3/ -form3 *Click to add item (QPounder) to cart* /Closes, Opens form2, updates cart textbox with new cart list/ -form2 Rinse and repeat until the user clicks a button to checkout. As of now forms do move between eachother but when I add an item to the cart and return to Form2, nothing there has changed. Also, I appreciate the advice regarding naming and Exception Handling. I do tend to neglect these and I can see that this can and will lead to many problems. Some of my neglect (Specifically Exception Handling) may be due in part to using Visual Basic because I'm unfamiliar with the syntax so I subconsciously push it away but hey, this is a prime example of when it causes issues so I will specifically address this. Thanks again *I designed the interface in the past and it isn't great but I have to stick with it for the purpose of this exercise*
&gt; I designed the interface in the past and it isn't great but I have to stick with it for the purpose of this exercise ok, I hear you... and since this is a school thing I will leave it at that. What you are going to need is to pass the data created in Form1 to Form2 BEFORE you close or hide Form1. You can do this by an exposed property or variable. It is generally considered a bad idea to pass data directly to a public variable. The reason/value of passing data to a public property is that you can allow for data validation (or other business rules) in the property. It is passing values to these forms and not keeping alive a place where the values are stored. You create a cart class in Form1, then add values to it, then open Form2 but don't pass values to it. Even when you do, you need to pass those values back to Form1 when Form2 is completed it's action. This is the problem, how you are passing the data around. You will need to pass the data from Form to Form... I know this is a lot, but once you get it the process gets easier. Food for thought about UI: The UI pattern you are creating SEEMS to be some of the cause of your problems/confusion. I read a book a long time ago that I still highly recommend; [About Face](https://www.amazon.com/About-Face-Essentials-Interaction-Design/dp/1118766571/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1477262691&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=about+face) by Alan Cooper (he created VB) One point he made is that opening a new form/window is akin to making a customer in a retail/real-world store go into another room to do a specific task. ie: Get the items in this room, then go into another room to pay for it.
Do you have any particular GUIs you have in mind?
that's not managing a db, that's simply using one. your bog standard Getting Started guide for the database system you are using will do fine.
Thanks for confirming! You wouldn't happen to have an example I can take a look at, would you? I _think_ I can follow the rest of the blog I linked to if I get the enumerating part working.
Thank you for your input! I'm trying to _not_ use ADB, though. I want to create an application which requires minimal user preparation. Enabling ADB access via developer settings is just too much for some users ;-) I _will_ use ADB to sync mp3 ratings, though. That part will be completely optional, though (since it also requires root)
Yeah it is just a design time lock on the control. I also doubt it is in any way required to reproduce for the purposes of the homework. It is only visible at design time.
Just set the current directory to whatever you want prior to launching cmd.exe. System.IO.Directory.SetCurrentDirectory("C:\windows\") Process.Start("cmd.exe")
It's been a while since I worked in this, but as far as I can tell it all I did to get this working was disassemble the Interop.PortableDeviceApiLib.dll and replace instance void GetDevices([in][out] string&amp; marshal( lpwstr) pPnPDeviceIDs, with instance void GetDevices([in][out] string[] marshal( lpwstr[]) pPnPDeviceIDs, And the code I'm using to enumerate the devices is var deviceManager = new PortableDeviceManagerClass(); uint count = 0; deviceManager.GetDevices(null, ref count); if (count == 0) return new WpdDevice[0]; var ids = new string[count]; deviceManager.GetDevices(ids, ref count);
Thanks! I've worked some more on the program following the advice you gave me and actually got it to work! At first I ended up pretty confused and actually almost gave up trying to finish the program without in-person help, but once I went through what you were saying more closely I managed to get it to work in whole as intended. My poor design of the interface really did make the task a lot more confusing for me (granted I designed it before knowing just how comfortable I was with using visual basic) but after this I feel a lot more confident with designing and implementing more sensible interfaces. I'll edit in examples of the code I used to solve my issues as a resolution in my original post if you're interested in what I finished up with - not entirely sure if it was what you intended or not, or even if the methods I used are good practice, but in the least it does seem to function well enough for the scope of this exercise. 
Removing list elements, or database entries, or any form of data where the index is involved in selection, will cause the index value of all following entries to change. Eg. you delete a row in excel and all following row indexes are adjusted by -1. If you do it backwards, from the end of an array or list, to the first element, then the code doesn't have to compensate for the index value changing, since it is not adjusting the properties of values it will access next. 
congrats! That's great. You should be so proud of yourself. Learning to code is not an easy task (despite what so many think) and it involves a literally endless number of details, functions and technologies. Always give yourself a bit of a break when you get frustrated, there is a limited amount of time and energy a person can devote during a given day and when you reach that limit, stop. I used VB for 20 years and moved to C# because it is now the more common language. Once you learn one language, learning another is much easier, so don't worry about that. I'm around if you have other questions, and again, congrats!
I tried that, but special chars aren't getting correctly decoded: is|should be ---|--- å| ã õ|ó ì|ê ü| ú ã | á ÷|õ And others. Last resort is to just treat each char individually.

Again, thank you! I manipulated the DLL file and re-assembled it with the changes you described. Now I need to find out how I get VS2015 to actually _use_ that file. I _think_ I got it right in a project, although I still don't see a difference. I only get the deviceId of an internal card reader. I'll try to unplug that to see what happens...

This new program does what exactly besides seeming sketchy as fuck, you Nigerian prince
You've got 3.1?! LUCKY!! I'm over here on DOS 3.2! 
It's a little late, but here's a solution that uses loops to the max. Dim numbers(4) as Integer For n = 0 to 4 numbers(n) = Val(InputBox("enter number")) Next Dim highest as Integer = -1 For Each i in numbers() If i &gt; highest then highest = i Next MessageBox.Show(highest) Whenever you find yourself naming variables like number1, number2 etc, you should always consider using a list or array instead. In my above example, I first created an array of integers called numbers(). Using a loop, I then populated each element of the array with a user-provided number. Afterwards, I used another loop to go through each number and find the highest. I then displayed the highest, and viola! The exact same result, with 1/3 less typing (which in turn means that you're less likely to make a mistake somewhere).
depends on what VB you're using. if VBA/Excel, you can put the formula in a cell. for others you can making embed vbscript to eval it. otherwise you need to parse out the formula and manually evaluate it. 
If you can get by with only the four basic operators, you can use a DataTable object and its ".Compute" method: Sub Main Dim dt = New DataTable Dim expr = "21 + 5 * 17 / ( 8 - 6)" Dim result = dt.Compute(expr, Nothing) Console.WriteLine(result) ' prints 63.5 End Sub 
Well not directly. There is a possible workaround, but it's not pretty: ' from StackOverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1452282/doing-math-in-vb-net-like-eval-in-javascript Sub Main Dim expression As String = "(Sin(0) + Cos(0)+Tan(0)) * 10" Dim updatedExpression As String = Regex.Replace(expression, "(?&lt;func&gt;Sin|Cos|Tan)\((?&lt;arg&gt;.*?)\)", Function(match As Match) _ If(match.Groups("func").Value = "Sin", Math.Sin(Int32.Parse(match.Groups("arg").Value)).ToString(), _ If(match.Groups("func").Value = "Cos", Math.Cos(Int32.Parse(match.Groups("arg").Value)).ToString(), _ Math.Tan(Int32.Parse(match.Groups("arg").Value)).ToString())) _ ) Dim result = New DataTable().Compute(updatedExpression, Nothing) Console.WriteLine(result) End Sub
so that would keep everything and would work? Could i make it so other functions work, like math.pi? Cheers

If textbox 2 already has the current value, couldn't you grab it, convert it to an integer, increase it by 1, then repopulate textbox 2?
but wouldn't I need a new button for that? button1 does what i mentioned above and when you click it again it doesn't do anything. and that's what i want to change. I want only one button I can click over and over and every time i do "b" gets increased by 1 (and also c of course because c = a + b ). 
If you're not changing the value in the first TextBox, it's not going to change what displays in the second TextBox when you increase the first TextBox's value by 1. Say we use your value 1 in TextBox1. When you click Button1, it calculates TextBox1's value (1) + b (1) = 2, and displays 2 in TextBox2. Every time you click it, it's making that calculation, and re-displaying the same result, even though it looks like it's not doing anything. What you could do is make a global variable (something like moving `Dim b As Integer = 0` right below `Public Class Form1` and above `Private Sub Button1_Click`, and replace `b = 1` with `b += 1`, which adds one to the value of b and assigns it to b, so that the second time you click Button1, b will already be 1, so next time it will be 2. Also, if you don't restrict what characters can be inserted into a TextBox, you could get an Exception which crashes your program. Look into using `Integer.TryParse` so you won't crash your program. EDIT: I actually went ahead and spent 5 minutes to create this application for you and show you how you should handle user input. Check out this [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/JVagazKa). I also made this [album on Imgur](http://imgur.com/a/bvuUQ) to show you that it works. I also made TextBox2 `ReadOnly` so that your user can't modify the output, that's why it looks greyed out.
So basically you want a loop statement? Dim a,b,c as int Dim Button1clickamount as int = 0 My VB is somewhat rusty, but that is how i would do it. As A, B and C all are defined as integers, then you can condense them to the one line. You implement a counter in a statement that increments the new variable Button1clickamount by 1 each time the button is pressed. New formula becomes a = a + Button1clickamount c = b + a Hope that helps.
Actually I had a problem with a more complex code and tried to make this question as simple as possible so I get some answers. The only thing I needed were global variables and b+=1, thank you so much, now it works :) 
Create a module and create a variable to store the textbox string in the module. Variables in modules are accessible from any form. This is kind of a quick and dirty way to move data between forms. I'm sure there are 1000 other ways to do the same thing.
That's the problem. I want to be able to select as many as I want, but be able to show which ones are selected.

No need to .... Newer versions of VS include the Community Edition, that's free, and is essentially the Pro SKU from prior versions. 
No problem, hope you get it working. FWIW, if you can't get something working in the Express version, the Community is quite a bit larger on disk, but has a lot more templates built in (including Office add-in templates), so it may make life a bit easier. 
That is something I find a bit odd about this assignment that was given to a beginner, because there actually is no simple way to just stop an animated gif. Pictureboxes have the built in ability to animate a gif (assuming the gif is of course an animated one). However you have no direct control over the animation (start/stop/loop). Now if you had an animated gif, and also a single frame still gif, that would make more sense, just swapping between the animated and non animated ones would simulate the start/stop action, but if your teacher just told you to use this one animated gif and somehow make it start/stop animating via a button click, that is actually not something easily done. There is an ImageAnimator class in .NET, but that would not be something they would expect you to stumble across and use unless they told you "Use the ImageAnimator class for this assignment"
Makes a lot more sense that way. Glad you got it sorted.
Which version is OP using?

OP's screenshot shows VB.Net.
I have a list result result that wont bring the values back up from the sub routine. Any help is greatly appreciated. 
Sure I can help you. What do you have done so far? Please don't say nothing, and please don't say they didn't explain any of this stuff prior to giving you an assignment on it.
that was up to us to choose, some numbers maybe
I will assume since it is a subroutine, that you are passing in the array to be filled as a parameter to that subroutine, just like you are passing an array into your SkrivUt routine to use as the source to fill your listbox. So that would mean your array variable has already been declared, and then you need to call a FillArray subroutine, passing in that variable. So we could at least say that the signature of the subroutine should look like this: Private Sub FillArray(ByRef matrise() As Integer) 'code to fill array here End Sub Note a few things. I am passing in the matrise() array variable ByRef because otherwise you are just passing in a copy of your array (when using ByVal), and you don't want to do that because the items you fill the array with in your routine would only be filling the copy, not the original one that you made and passed into this subroutine. You want this array to be passed in, filled, and when the sub routine returns to the calling code, you want that array to be filled with those values. ByRef is what gives you that. Also note I am passing it in with a datatype (as integer) which is telling the compiler this array will be an array of numbers. Inside the subroutine, you want to use the ReDim keyword to declare an explicit bounds (number of elements) your array should have, and then proceed to fill that array with a number at each element. Something like this ReDim matrise(3) matrise(0) = 800 matrise(1) = 520 matrise(2) = 1984 matrise(3) = 156156 Now see if you can put that all together and make it work. Also, you can tell your teacher than they should have you guys coding with option strict and option explicit on. Based on your code above, that is not the case, and you can tell your teacher than if they don't think so, they can come here and explain why they are teaching shitty coding skills.
loanamnt is entered in a textbox
That is all well and good, but look at your code. Your loop condition is loop until loanamnt.text = 0. How does loanamnt.text ever get to 0?
That worked! Thank you so much!
I don't think that changed your situation. So you have that loanpay variable declared up top (with no value, so its initial value will be 0). Then in your gettotal click routine, you are looping until loanpay = 0. Well loanpay will = 0 on the first loop, meaning the loop will only run once, meaning there is no need for the loop. Do you know how to set break points and step through the code line by line? That is a lot easier to figure your logic out than writing lines of code and running it and seeing if the final output is right or wrong.
Yea that code wasn't right. It didn't copy what I actually had down for some reason.
Yea I figured out what is going on. I'm just really dumb.
Your Subs should be Functions that return the correct type OR return those values through the parameter list ByRef.
I haven't done VB on a regular basis for a while but your syntax and logic look correct except for this: what happens when you step through your program in debug mode? Do you notice the loanamtt variable perhaps missing 0 and going into the negative? Why not change the test condition that breaks your loop to cover that possibility? Edit: also, don't be too self deprecating :-) if you're spending ten minutes focused on a problem then that's a great start. Not everyone has that sort of discipline these days. Another edit: this is what I get for reading code late at night on my phone... are you stepping through in your debugger to make sure you're meeting your if conditions?
3am.. So I'm probably crazy. Wouldn't that random exit do drop him from his loop prematurely? 
Google this : 'sub vs function vb.net'
Yea I just fixed it. Just did &gt;Do Until loanamntt &lt;= 0 I have no idea how I overlooked that haha
I just remembered seeing it while I was studying for the actual test. Haven't looked too deeply into the instructors materials but it might be worth checking out. Good luck! Sorry about posting just the link without explanation. I was on mobile and didn't have much time. 
sorry, used to VBA try: outputString = outputString &amp; inputLetter you'll also need to replace the + with an &amp; where it adds the newline 
so you need a new string as an output, what you're doing currently is adding the inputNumber onto the end of the inputLetter. So change: "letter = letter &amp; number" to "str= str&amp; letter" and "letter = letter &amp; vbNewLine" to "str= str&amp; vbNewLine" and "Console.WriteLine(letter)" to "Console.WriteLine(str)" where "str" is the new output string
It worked! Thank you so much! Now I just need to remember this and learn from it. 
if you need a mentor I'll be happy to help :)
Thanks a lot! And I kind of do need a mentor. I'm currently studying business, organistation and management and they recommended me to take IT next to it (to increase the chances on the job market). So far I've completed other programming languages like HTML and Javascript, but now I'm up on software design and the Uni flatout gave me the assignment to make an Hangman application or a Tic-Tac-Toe game in VB console and I need to learn the steps to make one of these two in any way possible. So if it's possible, I would like to learn the steps in VB to get there. 
Your radio and check box controls are the options the user can choose. A basic if/end if is what you need. The simplest method would be to create constant values for thin crust, thick crust, and the toppings. Add up all the options into a price variable and display the total amount to the user.
thank you!

I did that already, and I've changed it to &amp; though MSDN documentation states with two string operands + is functionally identical.

yeah, just realized especially having 10 more forms in this project, I should have 1 form hidden just to store that function, and that's not good. all right, thank you for the input.
is @output_execution_id actually defined as an output param in the sql? and what variable are you binding it to get receive that output? also, is it a function, or is it a stored proc? there's a significant difference.
This is what shows up if I go to modify the procedure (slightly different). I don't really know much about SQL, but I know that this is listed under stored procedures in the navigation pane and says that it's a stored procedure in the properties. USE [Operations] GO /****** Object: StoredProcedure [dbo].[execute_ssis_Intl_Wires_Drafts_Import_Cambridge] Script Date: 11/8/2016 11:44:53 AM ******/ SET ANSI_NULLS ON GO SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON GO ALTER procedure [dbo].[execute_ssis_Intl_Wires_Drafts_Import_Cambridge] @output_execution_id bigint output as begin declare @execution_id bigint exec ssisdb.catalog.create_execution @folder_name = 'International' ,@project_name = 'Intl_Wires_Drafts_Import_Cambridge' ,@package_name = 'Intl_Wires_Drafts_Import_Cambridge.dtsx' ,@execution_id = @execution_id output exec ssisdb.catalog.start_execution @execution_id set @output_execution_id = @execution_id end 
Yes, definitely a stored procedure. Have you checked to make sure that the caller executing the stored procedure has the appropriate rights in SSISDB? With SQL Server 2012, there are now additional specific permissions required to fire a SSIS package using T-SQL - your user ('caller') may have the appropriate permissions to the Stored Procedure, but not to the SSIS package itself.
I have not checked that; that sounds promising. Would my user just need the execute rights on the SSISDB? Also, I am logged into the SQL Management Studio and the website as the same user, but I am able to execute the stored procedure from studio; would that mean I should already have the correct permissions or could there still be an issue?
I've never seen grease, sadly.
To save a text file you want to take a peek at this code: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hxwfzt61.aspx Change: file.WriteLine("Here is the first string.") to: file.WriteLine(YOUR_TEXTBOX.Text) When you START your program Visual Studio is creating the application (EXE) This is created within a sub folder within your code. This folder is called "bin" and will have "Debug" and/or "Release" folders depending on if you set your compile to Debug or Release. Creating a History list would require you to scan a folder for files and then load that list of files into, for an example, a ListBox or create menus for each file.
I tried the file.WriteLine(displayText.Text) &lt;- My textbox name but still, the file doesnt contain anything.. the .txt file is empty when i try to type anything in debug

Are you planning on using a barcode font?
Im not too bothered by the fonts at the moment but if you have any recommendations that would be very useful
I meant did you need to display actual barcodes as barcodes, which you would normally do with a barcode based font. [Like this](https://www.barcodesinc.com/free-barcode-font/)
i did it all, but i did a mistake, i placed all of it in a wrong sub, my fault lol I have another question.. can you help me with it?
I wanted to try and make a Voting system, But i noticed that anyone can switch between radiobuttons and vote several times.. is there a way to make the voter only vote once?
I thought about it being so harsh, someone suggested that i disable radiobuttons and add a button to save the vote to a text file, i dont know how to disable radiobuttons tho :P 
It's perfectly fine to ask, that is what we are all here for. Besides you are just ignorant (which is really ok) what I hate is stupidity (and over the many years I have worked with other developers who should know this stuff and that makes them stupid... so REALLY, don't worry about it at all. Most visible objects (buttons, labels, textboxes etc) have a property called ENABLED. That value is a boolean. So the code would be: rdoVote1.Enabled = False 
ill try it out and maybe tell you if i have any more questions im really thankfull that you didnt get angered by my questions :P Im still a student in school and this is the first year they actually teach us programming or anything close to it (they always teached us THIS IS MOUSE,THIS IS KEYBOARD,WOW) and my passion was always programming and i really didnt know who i can ask other than reddit :P Thanks for your help :D
Cool, good for you. There is always lots to learn, so try not to be too hard on yourself. I am currently playing with Unity and the Oculus Rift to see what things can be done with these tools, and it can still be frustrating for me after all these years (bad documentation, code that doesn't work, me missing some piece of info that affects everything) So don't stress and try to have fun too. 
Oh i see, no i am supposed to just leave it as the barcode
Okay thank you I'm going to fix it and see if it works Edit: Still doesn't work..I'm having a hard time finding the problem. I find this so confusing. My real solutions are not coming out correctly
Seems like im bothering you one more time.. I made my code and all but voting doesnt save Value 1 To text file I made two buttons Save Vote and Save Vote and Close program Buttons everything is working correctly, Disabling radiobuttons after Saving the vote,quitting the program,Choosing what vote you want and everything BUT It doesnt save the votes to text files Here is the code: http://pastebin.com/m7kgrJ36 Help me whenever you can :D Thanks in advance
Programming doesn't work like an Excel spreadsheet - you can't assign formula to variables like you do for Dim D... = on line 4 and have the calculation performed automatically when the values change. All assignments are computed at the line of code with the values they would be at that point in time. You need to assign the values of A, B, and C from the textboxes before computing and assigning the result to D, which depends on A, B and C. I'd go further and point out that you've probably not thought about any code for ensuring that the textboxes can only accept numbers - your program will crash if you entered letters into the form. Try it! You can avoid this in a quick and dirty fashion by using: "A = val( textACoeff.text )" instead of the plain "A = textACoeff.text". Val() converts its argument to a double and gives you 0 if it can't make heads or tails of the input. This should give you some extra points.
Ok, so first off I'm going to give you a small piece of advice that will save you so much aggravation later on. Name your object RIGHT AFTER you create them. "RadioButton2" and "Button1" do not help you (or us) to know what these objects are. I wrote a small article years ago about naming conventions: http://www.blissgig.com/default.aspx?id=17 The next piece of info that you need to be aware of is the Lifespan of an object. Every object is created, used, and then destroyed/disposed. In your RadioButton code you create a boolean and then assign it to "true" or "false", which is fine, except that when the click event competes that variable, "z", is no longer available. ("Z", seriously "z"?! Come on man, name these something useful! tehe) Then in your Button click event you create a NEW boolean variable and check if it's "true" (it's not. Be aware a number of data types have default value, some are just "null". Number types are default of "0", boolean default to "false") So what you need a variable that is available for the lifespan of the form. Here is how you do that Notice that there is a new variable at the top called "bVote" and this vairiable is what is checked in RadioButton2 **AND** what is used to store the value until the SAVE button ("Button2") is selected Public Class Form1 Private bVote As Boolean = False //THIS IS THE NEW VARIABLE Private Sub RadioButton2_CheckedChanged(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles RadioButton2.CheckedChanged If RadioButton2.Checked = True Then bVote = True Else bVote = False End If End Sub Private Sub Button2_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button2.Click Dim file As System.IO.StreamWriter file = My.Computer.FileSystem.OpenTextFileWriter("c:\Users\co\Desktop\Visual Basic Projects\Vote.txt", True) file.WriteLine("The vote is: " + bVote) file.Close() End Sub End Class See, you need a place to hold your data (whatever that is, and you need to be aware of how long you need that data. ie: Just for the time when you are doing a calculation, or maybe for as long as the user is on the Web Page/Windows Form, or maybe you need to save that data to disc so you can get it hours, days or years later. In this case you only need to hold it until the user closes the form.
Congarts. Always a nice moment when the code works. Feel free to post the new code to pastebin. 
http://pastebin.com/VXRjq1tt Here is the new code, ill start to contact you on the email later :D
Ill try to be more organized on the next program i make :D Still dont know what but will look into it :D
clear as in unselect everything, or clear as in remove all items? for former, loop the items and unselect them.
Button clear as going back to the original setting
"original setting" isn't a thing, it's concept you defined. you have to write code to make the state be whatever that is.
That won't unchecked checked items in the list though, that will only reset the highlighted selected item to the first item in the list. Same goes for a combobox. That will just set the text in the combobox to the first dropdown item. So just be aware of that.
Omg thank you! My professor like honestly doesn't even know how to code himself so it makes it extremely hard to learn 
Code please? We don't write, we help debug.
Before I did a program that would randomly turn caps lock on, and move their mouse to the top right of the screen every minute. Pretty harmless but very annoying if you put it in start up. Or you could open their disc drive randomly with a batch file. Your idea is also very possible. Give me a few minutes My.Computer.Audio.Play("C:. \yourmusicpath.wav", AudioPlayMode.WaitToComplete)
Problem solved, thanks!
tweq, I shook my head when I read the post. you have more patience than I do :)
It might be fun to set it up as a service or perhaps a scheduled task. Perhaps disabling the alt key would also be fun, if possible. Alt+Tab, Alt+F4, Crtl+Alt+Del. None of them would work to get you out of the program :-D
Another error in this is that you used the abs function. It makes no diff for the calculation of a, but the final new x,y will always be in the direction of the first quadrant due to the abs function (which may be incorrect)
Oh snap you're right, good catch. I was clearly derping out.
You want to use the `UBound(Array)` or `Array.Length` functions/methods to get the size of an array.
what i know is something like this (inside a For Next statement) txtData.Text &amp;= "Day " &amp; (iCount + 1) &amp; vbTab &amp; TempReading(iCount) &amp; vbCrLf which is applicable for 1 column array only. i don't know what to do if there's an indefinite number of columns.
You are possibly looking for the `UBound(Array, Index)` parameter. It lets you test multidimensional arrays.
i have tried using the Indexof() however im fairly new to vb as a hobby so im still learning how to count the letters in a word. my freind recommended me try this because apparently this is really good practice. if you can set me on the right path it would be much appreciated.
im trying to replace the vowels in a word is my goal

You're going to have to give some info about what specifically you are trying to get help with.
What code have you got so far?
I usually load my items into a datatable, create a data view and make that the datasource of the list, then as the user types, set the row filter. The list nicely prunes down to items matching what's in the textbox.
Ah well that is kind of silly, but it's just a school project so...
You could Split the string on the period, which would give you an array of strings, one entry for each piece of the version number. Do that for the old and new version number, to get two arrays. Then for each entry in each array, convert each entry to an integer and compare the two entries. The logic would be something like "if the first entry of the new version number is higher, then it's a higher version number. Otherwise look at the next entry. Do that for all entries".
Ignore my post - this sounds like the perfect solution. Never pass up a chance to use something built in to the framework :)
Thanks, I used a modified version of the example code and I got rid of the error. Now, I'm still not getting the data I want from the server, but that is another problem entirely... Thanks!
Why not just have a variable that replaces the '.' and then does a Format that will add extra zeros to the end so they are the same length. So basically one would look like 783461500 and the other 800001254. In your case you don't even need format, but in the case that you could have 7.16.something then you would. So you could make it add 10 zeroes to the right if needed. Could even use length and replace instead of Format, but either should work.
Hey, thank you for your reply. I do indeed mean a VBA file that I could keep running in the background. Would a program have the same handle every single time? Or does it change every time you run it? The focus thing sounds interesting, I am going to look into that, thank you.
it'll have the same handle as long as it's still running. if it gets restarted it'll change, so it's best to check every time. I've only ever done this kind of thing long ago from VB6 using win32 APIs. I have no idea if any of this is even possible in VBA. you can certainly do it in vb.net
the same way you found it the first time...
which may or may not be the window handle of the window they want to send keystrokes to.
We are not allowed to use integrated authentication. Every app must use sql authentication. Something about connection pooling performance. 
Encryption can be a very broad and exhausting topic to cover, and I believe that's why YouTube producers try to avoid that rabbit hole when presenting database oriented programming topics. I know that VB Toolbox does this in the interest of time. :-) For password storage, many store an encrypted hash with a randomized salt. Then the user sends an authentication attempt and and the authentication server tests password by encrypting it with the stored salt to see if the encrypted string matches what is stored. That way you're not actually storing the password itself in the db. Something like this: [In your form class] Imports System.Security.Cryptography Imports System.Text Private Function NaCl() As String Dim rnd As New Random Dim sodium As String = "" For i = 0 To 87 sodium += Chr(rnd.Next(34, 126)) ' ASCII CHAR CODES Next Return sodium End Function Private Function Hash512(password As String, salt As String) As String Dim strBytes As Byte() = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(password &amp; salt) Dim hashAlg As HashAlgorithm = New SHA512Managed() Dim hashBytes As Byte() = hashAlg.ComputeHash(strBytes) Return Convert.ToBase64String(hashBytes) End Function Private Sub Form1_Shown(sender As Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Shown TextBox3.Text = NaCl() End Sub Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click TextBox2.Text = Hash512(TextBox1.Text, TextBox3.Text) MsgBox(Hash512(TextBox1.Text, TextBox3.Text).Length) End Sub If you want to obfuscate the password in transit as well you could have the authentication sever app send its own encryption key to the client, then the client encrypts the password string with that key before sending it to the server which then decrypts it and tests the password hash. And then there are session tokens...
I am no game developer but i cant see any point to use a timer for moving the character left or right... it seems ridiculous to me. Anyway, you never stop those timers so they tick endlessly and keep the character moving. At least thats what i think on first glance. As i said i ever never written a platformer but thats not they way i would go about it. Maybe you should try other tutorials as well. Edit: oh now i overlooked the stops. you do stop them indeed. But right on key up after you started them on key down? that sounds problematic. But i will take another look in a moment. Edit: Sorry i cant see what exactly the problem is right now but the more i look at this code the more i am sure this is the worst way to do it. I would recommend handling all this stuff in the gameloop. let the sprite call every tick a function named update position in which you apply periodically a vector and a force to the current position of the sprite according to the direction you want the sprite to go. Also apply the gravity every frame as a downward vector. This way you have full control about the movement of the sprite. But i am not sure i would recommend that to a beginner. 
You will want to learn to write a piece of code, then run it. That way you get to see exactly what works or what does not. Also, your Timer Up (tmrUp) is subtracting "moveSpeed" which seems very odd, at least based on the name. Also what is your timer interval? Also before you start your timer, shut off the others. Like the other poster mentioned, this seems like an odd way to achieve your result, using Timers. So be aware of that 
Don't use 3 "randoms", just use one. As you pointed out, since they seed themselves from the timer on initialization, if you initialize 3 in quick succession and then call them in quick succession, you'll get identical results. Just initialize one and use the same on for each list. You'll get 3 different numbers no matter how quickly you ask for them, since the internal state will change after each one.
Thank you so much! That did it!
You already asked this question, then deleted it. Why the hell would we waste our time? Go to a gamedev forum please. 
Could it be because you're setting X to 0 every time your timer ticks, therefore your if statement is always less than 20?
