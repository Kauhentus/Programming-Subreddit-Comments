You can change the font that cmd.exe displays by right-clicking on the title bar of the console window and choosing 'Properties'. I don't think you're going to be able to change in programming.
Glad the manual write worked for you. :)
ok. 
so once you have the entire 2 paragraphs on the screen and you want people to see it but not edit it, instead of using .visible, use .enabled which will leave it showing but can't be changed.
So what would I use so that someone could write 2 paragraphs? That’s the part I’m more confused on sorry should have explained more
Well you could do it the way you were doing it, one text box per paragraph, that would work, then when the second is finished, add them both into one text box, display that one and do not enable it. Alternatively I believe there is a readonly property for a rich text box, you could use that. 
Hmmm I have the one rich text box but when I double click it and I’m in the code I get lost as well you said put the .enabled but what be in front what I have the rich text box named or? 
enabled and visible are two different things. Visible is pretty straight forward, enabled means that the control can be clicked on and manipulated. So what I would do is have 2 text boxes and 1 Rich text box in the same area. only have one visible at a time. take the first paragraph change the visible and then make the second text box visible only (the other two not visible). When the third is made visible, add the .text from the first and the second with some paragraph formatting inbetween and you are done.
you could do a keyhandling event where you only accept letters, numbers and spaces for each of the text boxes. do you want it to be like a typewriter?
well you don't need the keystuff then. The way I said to do it a few messages ago would work.
I'm not seeing any code at this link.
That's weird; I can see it. Is there something I need to do to make it "shareable", like a privacy setting?
Huh, how strange is that. I can see it FireFox but not IE.

You should avoid on error resume next and use try catch instead
This is what the end result was, which worked. I ended up rubber ducky debugging in the process of asking the actual question. I figured I couldn't have a post about a lesson learned for posting your code without posting my code. :)
You need an array of size NUM allocated when NUM is defined. Then loop through the array and fill it with user input per index. If you need more clarification, let me know. Google is your friend.

Deleted, sorry! I found my answer here : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29827775/convert-excel-vba-macro-to-vbscript
Does typing "chcp 1252" in the console before running your code help?
You should use arrays
What’s that? 
Try this: Dim aNames As New List(Of String) For p = 1 To 5 Name = InputBox$("Enter 5 names.") aNames.Add(Name) Next p aNames.Sort() MsgBox(String.Join(vbCrLf, aNames.ToArray)) PS. I help you with this because I know the classwork/homework sucks and these assignments are barely relevant in the real world. I don't want you to get discouraged, keep trying.
Never looked into newer versions, it’s the only one my company computer had 
you're just overwriting the "name" 5 times. you'll only be left with the last entry. if you use an array you can apply a sorting function to it. you can either write one or find one online. with VB6 you often do this kind fo thing just with the GUI. have a text box that adds the entry to a list box, then just turn on the list box's sorted property. it'll be a faster sort than a writing your own as well since it'll run in the C backend that's behind most of VB's GUI.
Visual Studio is the best developer environment for Windows. It's worth the $500. HOWEVER, you won't be able to ***easily*** convert your existing VB6 code from to 2017.
Further to that VB6 is not object oriented. While it's confusing at first, in the long run, it's wayyyyy better.
You haven't needed to buy it for several versions now. The community version is free, even for commercial shops within certain restrictions. 
It was object based though, so you could use a lot of OO concepts and principles (classes, collections, private variables backed by properties, etc). But yea, it's weak compared to modern OO .NET, and so much harder to use once you get your head wrapped around everything that's available in .NET. 
I didn't realize it was object oriented at all. Of course, i'm not sure 20 years ago i knew what object oriented was. LOL. Whats with all these stupid dots?
I can't type anything in the console - the application runs and opens it's own console window immediately.
Can you try something like Console.OutputEncoding = Text.Encoding.UTF8 at the start of the program?
You could create a new variable for the do until loop, and then after the loop finishes set your hud text to the new variable? Dim tempMaxClipSize as Integer = MaxClipSize Dim tempRemainder as Integer = Remainder Do Until tempMaxClipSize = 24 tempMaxClipSize += 1 tempRemainder -= 1 If tempRemainder = 0 Then Exit Do End If Loop MaxClipSize = tempMaxClipSize Remainder = tempRemainder 
I know what I am doing, and if I run into any bugs I just use Integer.Parse. The point of this is to just test the math out and this is not how it is going to be done in the game. I have each compenent of the Ui broken into separate modules and a core scri0pt that holds player information. These modules just look for values, they don't ever accept a value. And lastly I had a cup of coffee and figured out a way of doing this with less code but works like a charm. It is a bit hacky but should do for now. Public Class Form1 Dim MaxClipSize As Integer = 24 Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.MouseDown If Not Clip.Text = 0 Then Clip.Text = Clip.Text - 1 End If End Sub Private Sub Form1_KeyDown(sender As Object, e As KeyEventArgs) Handles MyBase.KeyDown If e.KeyCode = Keys.R Then If Not Clip.Text = MaxClipSize And Not Remainder.Text = 0 Then Clip.Text = Integer.Parse(Clip.Text) + Integer.Parse(Remainder.Text) Remainder.Text = 0 If Clip.Text &gt; MaxClipSize Then Remainder.Text = Clip.Text - MaxClipSize Clip.Text = 24 End If End If End If End Sub End Class
If you know what you're doing, then you don't need us.
&gt; First of all, don't reference values from the text of a text box. Use variables I was simply telling you that for a small test program as this, I am not worried about that because it will work using variables or using the text either way. The only way a bug would occur is the label thinks you are appending text which in that case you just use Integer.Parse.
When it's just as easy to declare variables and use them, why not do it the way that will lead to fewer problems in the long run, even if it's purely to stay in the habit? Using text boxes to store data just seems so "Hello World" to me. There's a reason veterans don't do this. The best programming practice is to use variables, so you should do that, even in quick and dirty test programs, if only to avoid looking like a newb when you ask questions online. It's just a good habit to get into. That's all I'm saying.
You’re not getting what I’m saying. If this was a commercial application which it is not obviously I wouldn’t do that. The reason I did it for this is because I needed a quick and dirty example of what I’ll be doing later in Unity.
`Math.Min(bulletsMissingFromMag, bulletsRemainingInReserve)`?
That mechanic is in most games, CRYSIS is not special in that regard.
In a casual shooter it is not. I am making a casual shooter like Call of Duty which does not do that. Neither does Halo, or even Battlefield, or even Titanfall. All casual shooters.
That’s the same as maxClipSize - clip.
No, it's not.
Wait, I looked at that wrong, my apologies.
Actually I just tested it. Let’s say I have a max clip size of 24 I have 24/40 I shoot one Now I have 23/40 maxClipSize - 23 = 1 Your code also returns 1.
You shouldn't take anything I've said as a personal attack. It's meant only to help you. Also, you're not the only person reading this. People, especially beginners need to know there is a better way of doing things.

For question 1, you should be able to use ActiveSheet.Name For question 2: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vba/excel-vba/articles/workbooks-open-method-excel The Workbooks.Open function has parameters that allow you to specify the password, open the file read-only, skip updating links, etc.
this is vb code? or a macro? isn't "Area Schedule B" the name?

Maybe use Enabled instead of visible. But that is not what's causing that. I'm assuming that you expect the user to fill out a textbox and only after that, the button should become visible? In that case you can't use the Form.Load event since that only occurs once when the Form is loaded the first time.
Yes. So where should I put my code?
Use "" instead vbnull
Doesn't work.
Okay, but where?
There are several ways of doing this. It depends on how many textboxes there are. If there are just a few you simply could use the TextBox.textchanged event on each textbox and in there do a check for all the textboxes.(Btw do you want the button to work only when all textboxes are filled out or also only with one? Right now this code would enable with only one having text inside) But with a few textboxes this would get messy quite fast. Another one would be to have the button always enabled and check on pressing the button if everything is filled out correctly and display an error message if not. Probably the easiest one, but depends if you want it to function that way. Also any reason why you use VB2010 and not a newer version?(Just me being curious)
U can insert ur code in a function and then call it in all 'changed' events of all textboxs
&gt; do you want the button to work only when all textboxes are filled out Yes. &gt; Another one would be to have the button always enabled and check on pressing the button if everything is filled out correctly and display an error message if not. This is my Plan B. &gt; Also any reason why you use VB2010 and not a newer version?(Just me being curious) It's what we use in school.
Thank you. I made an app that is able to retrieve window handles but only within the apps bounds, I guess it shouldn’t be too difficult to expand on it.
U should get all proccess id using winapi and then u have hWnd of window u need and using correct api functions u can do everything over that window
Use dim instead private
&gt; use the TextBox.textchanged event on each textbox and in there do a check for all the textboxes. I've tried this and what happens is if I input data on just one of the textbox, the button appears right away. I want it to appear only if I've filled all textboxes. How can I do this?
Thanks for the added info. Looks like I have a fun project for today.
you would have to check all textboxes. If you used your code from above it's clear that it does that since you've got your logic wrong. With the 'and' in the if statement you checking if all textboxes have NO text and if they do the button is visible. As soon as one has text the statement is false and therefore your button visible. Either use Or instead of and, or use Not (as in if not textbox.txt = "" Then...) and reverse the visible statement.
To clarify, I have to copy-paste that entire same "ALLTEXTBOX.txt" to each individual textbox? 
Better to make your own function and call that in the textbox event.
So I tried that. If only one textbox event has that command, it works well. But, if I give the same function to the remaining textboxes, the button doesn't even hide itself at all. It's just there.
What's the code you have now?
I've tried that, too. Still doesn't work. Ugh. You know what? I'll just go for Plan B. In my Rich Textbox, if the textboxes are empty, it will display a text. But, when I run... I get an error: "Conversion from string "" to type 'Long' is not valid." The entire "if [TEXTBOXES.TXT then" is highlighted. 
Nvm, I got Plan B working. Thank you for your efforts anyhow!
Btw, I just wrote a quick sample to check if the code is working in theory, which it is: Public Class Form1 Private Sub TextBox1_TextChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles TextBox1.TextChanged Handlebtn() End Sub Private Sub TextBox2_TextChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles TextBox2.TextChanged Handlebtn() End Sub Private Sub TextBox3_TextChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles TextBox3.TextChanged Handlebtn() End Sub Private Sub Handlebtn() If TextBox3.Text = "" Or TextBox2.Text = "" Or TextBox1.Text = "" Then Button1.Enabled = False Else Button1.Enabled = True End If End Sub End Class 
Yep, I've done exactly just that. Didn't work. 
Without any code there really isn't a way to give you an answer. Why are you creating the 20 tables if you only need 2? You should really only be creating what you need, not creating everything and deleting what you don't need.
All 20 will be used in various circumstances, just not at the same time. Generally there will be 2 used. (in some situations only one will be used..or even none on rare occasion) They all have to be available to be used and are all different. I do not know what code to offer you... I am not even sure if it is possible. I do know that creating the tables programmatically is time consuming and bulky. If there is a way to remove the 18 that I do not need it would be far more efficient than creating code to construct the 20 programmatically. Either way they will need to be potentially created for each report. Whether the program puts them into the final document or takes them out from the template is the issue. Sorry I don't have code to show you because... one method I feel comfortable with doing even though it is ...bulky and ugly and the other ...I don't know if it is possible .
you're looping the columns, so just don't loop the columns and grab the first column instead.
Dont know how to do that :(
Thanks man, I was able to sort it out :)
We are here for Visual Basic questions, not C#. Please check out r/csharp for future reference. But for now which part of the code is failing?
sorry i thought if there were questions in general thanks for the help... I figured out the problem-ish after I created the Supercard, A new class with method for Rank=number of card and Suit=suit of card. when I was passing in the rank I can't get it to translate the rank to an int so I can add it up and compare it to the other hand... My work around was creating a huge switch and that was it...
For questions in general pertaining to .NET check out r/dotnet.
A lot of your variables are incorrect here, that's why it's failing: This line: `If txtcost Is 0 Or () Then Message."Please enter total bill amount"` should be: `If txtcost.Text = "0" Or txtcost.Text = "()" Then MsgBox("Please enter total bill amount")` * You're pulling the data from a textbox, so you need to specifically write `txtcost.text` * For an equality check, you need to use the `=` sign and then a value. If the value is a number, you don't need the `" "` around the zero, but because you're pulling it as a string from the textbox, it's good practice to mark it as such. * For the `Or` part, you need to explicitly declare what you're "Or"ing. Then in this line: `tipamt = amt * tipper` I presume you meant `tipperc` because there is no `tipper` variable defined. This will get your code to compile, however your output is not accurate because of one last mistake you made early in your code. I'll leave that to you to work out, but here's a hint: &amp;nbsp; For this piece of code: Dim numberA as String = "5" Dim numberB as Decimal = 10 Msgbox(numberA + numberB) &amp;nbsp; The output is: `510` 
Where are you getting the input from the user? The Select statement looks fine. I just don't see where you are actually setting the variable IntDay. 
Aside from a couple of spelling errors, this works fine. Tuesday and Thursday...btw Edit: Oh wait, unless you are writing a Forms app and trying to do a console.writeline.. Try using Msgbox() instead: ... Case Else MsgBox(Tracy) End Select MsgBox(StringDay)
Is this a case where you forgot to put a console.readline() at the end of your code so that the console window doesn't automatically close. Because I see nothing wrong with the code otherwise.
Fair enough
Isn't that some sort of copyright infringement or piracy? Reselling copies of something for your own profit as I'm guessing you don't own 1 copy per request that you bought at full price...

Looked at the link. Looks so advanced but I'm gonna try to learn that and also writing the code in Windows Forms if possible. I'm sort of learning and new at this. I'm taking VB as a University course but we are currently doing Windows Forms Application. That seems more harder than console cause you have to assign code for different Tools. If you have any sources to learn Windows Forms you could reply with a link. Also I'm beginning to like code so I wanna teach myself python too after this. Tried python first time and couldn't understand a thing so I think maybe VB will enlighten some things. Will work my way up. Thanks. 
I was using console. And it's doesn't recognize the code [MsgBox(String Day)] after writing End Select cause VB shows suggestions as you type your code. Console is red underlined with message "End of statement expected" 
You really should be using [`Option Strict`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/statements/option-strict-statement), especially for any kind of financial code. Your parameters are `Decimal`, but you're actually performing `Double` arithmetic and silently converting between the two all over the place.
design a "virus" that when you turn on the computer, it displays a bunch of annoying popups, then restarts the computer, install it on the teacher's computer. Tell him if he can't get rid of it, you get an A+, then delete it from his PC.
Look for a setting called "Hide Advanced Members" or something like that. It's your basic training wheels setting that's on by default for VB. Also, some methods are public, but never listed. There is an attribute that means "always hide this no matter what".
My brother basically did that. No restart, but closing a window would cause two more to open.

MdiForms are classes and not controls and are treated much like a form private sub from1_load(Sender as object, e as eventargs) handles form1_load Dim public newMDIChild as new FRMFirstChild ' public makes it available across form newMDIChild.mdiparent = form1 ' Be implicit saying ME could lead to issues if you have more than one mdi container. newMDIChild.show() end sub Private Sub btnItemMM_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnItemMM.Click newMDIChild.focus() End Sub 
THANK YOU, this has solved my problem, can I ask how to make my child forms show in a fix place inside the main form?
Excellent, Thanks, will try this weekend. Cheers. 
Thank you, this has solved the problem :)
That might explain why I can barely see any guide about it haha. But I guess I'll have to stick with MDI since tomorrow is the deadline and I don't have much time to learn another pattern :).
re: deadline Oh of course I don't want you to redo it now. Only want you to know before you become a professional. You may want to add to the menu the available MDI children. Take a peek here: http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/184407-mdi-child-form-list/
DDE, WOW there is a name I have not heard in a long time. It stands for Dynamic Data Exchange and I have not played with that in 20+ years (sorry) I did a quick search and found some .NET code that could be helpful https://github.com/afedyanin/dde-xltable-server It the word "SEEMS" in your first sentence that worries me. If you are not sure how your current code works and/or how the device receives signals you may have trouble. (as I am sure you know)
We don't have access to any thing related to the code other than the exe. It will pull data but printing is broken, and I haven't found a fix for that yet and it's needed.
Nobody knows who made it or how it works here, so you're spot on. Thanks for the link. I'll look over it and try to figure something out.
I have to agree with the other poster that you really want to see if you can get up up and running, maybe a virtual machine or old PC to cover you while you attempt to get this working again

SQL is your best option. What database are you using?
My datatable is generated in-program, can I apply SQL statements to a DataTable directly?

Via RS232 to serial converter.
In most cases PLCs have a simple control protocol. You may be able to find the specs online and talk to it directly through the serial port.
There are two methods that are commonly used to do this. The first most common is to take the code you want to run on a timed basis and put it in a discreet executable that is run via Windows Task Scheduler, the AT command or schtasks. The second method is to use the Timer Control in .Net to setup regular checks on the time and once your given increment is reached preform the associated action. [Task Scheduler](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc748993.aspx) [AT Command](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb726974.aspx) [schtasks](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725744.aspx) [Timer Class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.timers.timer.aspx) 
In windows you could use the Task Scheduler. Programmatically you have to loop and wait . Something like this: ' Sleep until top of the hour. 6:00pm, 7:00pm, 8:00pm...etc Do Until Now.Minute = 0 Threading.Thread.Sleep(1000) Loop ' Do the work... 
Ha! Look! Another way. Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load Dim T As New System.Threading.Timer(AddressOf MySub, Nothing, 0, 5000) End Sub Sub MySub(ByVal state As Object) MsgBox("Times up!") End Sub 
Opps, I'll move this over to dotnet. BTW, that solution did not work.
Do you need it to run even if no one is logged onto the machine? (e.g. in a server) If so, you might consider creating a Windows Service.
The code you posted does not change tb1.text when either CB is changed. When the selection is changed in either of checkboxes, **nothing** happens to tb1.text. you're setting variables, but not update tb1.text. I think you're post here is fine. Just explicitly state that it's a WPF project, the controls and objects have different names. 
Holy shit, thanks for all the help dude :) https://imgur.com/a/lKqaf My goal is to automate the button presses so that I can leave the system running for 12 hours at a time, would that be possible ?

Thanks, will look into it :)
Upvote for using group box and chart controls. Nice!
check the "visible" property on the controls. If the property is set to false then when the form is rendered they will not show up.
Did you try doing a rebuild? It may be using a cached copy of the form.
The first link is broken. If the button is resizing then check the "Anchor" property on the button. Set it back to the default, "Top, Left" In fact, check "Anchor" and "Dock" on all your controls. ...or Save all, and restart VS.
Set an image on what? If you’re trying to do it from Visual Studio then go into the Forms properties and set its image or background image. If it’s a control it must support it which most typically do.
Or: Public Class Form1 Private Sub TextBox1_TextChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles TextBox1.TextChanged, TextBox2.TextChanged, TextBox3.TextChanged Button1.Enabled = (TextBox3.Text &lt;&gt; "") AndAlso (TextBox2.Text &lt;&gt; "") AndAlso (TextBox1.Text &lt;&gt; "") End Sub End Class 
I would suggest this, **Question 1**. There are many ideas of what a modern database consists of. Access has a single model where the database and the interface are stored as a single object file and uses and internal scripting engine (VBA) to create logic in your application. A more standardized way to do this is to separate the Database and the application layer. The database becomes a place where information is stored and the application attaches to it. This is the first leap from access which I think you have recognized already. The second part of this is choosing your front end programming language. Since you have come here I am going to assume VB.NET **Database** Tech comes in many flavours. here a few. These are in my order of recommended preference for teaching and learning. - [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/onefile.html) - Similar to access that the database that stores all data structure in a file. The Data, Views, Functions etc are all similar to what you will find in all of the other examples, and anything you learn here is portable to the bigger systems. This is the one I recommend for you. No special server to download, and super easy to get started with. Here is a a link to an application that will get you started with creating, adding tables etc to an SQLite database http://sqlitebrowser.org/ and lastly here is a tutorial on how to create connect and work with an SQLite database. https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1210189/Using-SQLite-in-Csharp-VB-Net - [MYSQL](https://www.mysql.com/)/[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) are two open source free to use database servers. Middle weight for management and the first level of standalone database server. You can install these on your local computer without issue for learning. Both have windows implementation and both have drivers for connecting .NET .I prefer MYSQL for all of my web development, and I use PostgreSQL for scientific data. Here is a tutorial from MYSQL on how to connect Visual Studio to MSYQL https://dev.mysql.com/doc/visual-studio/en/visual-studio-making-a-connection.html - [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/sql-server/sql-server-2017) / Oracle Server These databases systems are consider the professional database servers. These are the grand daddy's of them all. They are heavy and expensive. Both have free versions for developers to learn. I recommend having a separate computer to install these on. **Development Software** Visual Studio 2017 Community is Free for developers and has all the tools you require to build applications. I may be a mod here but I am a professional developer, so I can not just recommend .NET without a counter point. I would also look at Python as as development language, it is easy to consume, simple language that in a lot of ways is easier than VB. Understand though it does not do much heavy lifting for you. You will need to look around for plugins that provide functionality that is built into VB. **Question 2**. Start with using datasets, datatables, and learning to query you chosen db and databind information to controls. Then look at creating data classes for intermediary data management and finally look at the EntityFramework. Here is a link to an older (vs2015) article on creating a database application using ADO.Net (ADO is the system that connects your application to the database) https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj943772.aspx This tutorial has a sprinkle of LINQ which you can think of as inline SQL. **Question 3**. Report generation is handled in VB.Net by using the Microsoft RDL report language. You create a project for your reports to build them and you consume the report via the RDL control. This is a link to the latest projects for RDL creation https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ProBITools.MicrosoftReportProjectsforVisualStudio here is a tutorial on creating a ReportViewer Report https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms252073.aspx **Question 4**. LINQ is an inline query tool for doing sql selects and data manipulation directly from inside your code. I would suggest at this time use SQL statements for now and you will learn more about LINQ over time. For simple stuff I still don't use LINQ I have always found it confusing. **Question 5**. well I moved onto MSSQL server from access, but that was 20 years ago.... You have more options and any of them listed here will get you started. Try SQLite with the SQLiteBroswer to get started. Once you get an app that works with that, then you can move onto something with a server. This stuff is a lot of fun, Let me know if I can answer anything else. 
1. c#, mvc, ef 2. .net 3. Crystal or ssrs 4. Learn it. It's great. 5. See #1
I think it is not possible, at least not directly. Try this: Dim a, b, c As Integer Dim result = myFunction(3) a = result(0) b = result(1) c = result(2)
Thank you for the detailed and long reply. I have been looking at Python, but it is a different beast than VBA. Python seems to be the "modern" alternative to BASIC but I am not sure what Python developers use to develop "real" applications, or how much relearning/mental shifts I need to endure before I get productive with another way of developing software. You mentioned: &gt;Access has a single model where the database and the interface are stored as a single object file and uses and internal scripting engine (VBA) to create logic in your application. A more standardized way to do this is to separate the Database and the application layer. The database becomes a place where information is stored and the application attaches to it. This is the first leap from access which I think you have recognized already. I think I have done this with Access already (kind of). My front end is separate from my back-end access database (via linked tables) so I can freely update my access forms/reports/code without affecting the data. It is also possible to not use Access's JET database and just use it as a front-end development tool for another database. I have linked Access front-end to a MySQL database for testing in the past (I think using the ODBC drivers). Developing in Access is enjoyable, I'd like whatever I switch to remain enjoyable. By the way, how about enabling the Wiki for this subreddit? Your reply could be a good FAQ. 
I think the wiki is enabled I have written some stuff in the past. I will check it out in case it was closed by other admins. Anyways let me know if you have any questions. 
My question is why? dim a(3) makes a(0), a(1), A(2) why dont you just assign the values to the arrays in a loop?
So you’re saying the question is should you leave MS Access and move to something else like SQL Server and maybe not use Access at all?
I am not sure what part of the code you are referencing Bone. My code above is just to show how I would like to return the results of myFunction. The real function is more complicated than the example, and has more arguments, but the question here only pertains to how the array is returned. In the real function the results are solved all together and yield n integer results. The calling function knows how many results to expect.
What I am wanting is to display all the books that relate to the Department selected in the combBox. If there is a course selected also, I want the DGV to filter to only those books related to both of those criterias.
Yeah, this was what I was trying to avoid, but it does work.
You should be able to filter after you assign the datasource. I think you should be able to do something like this... Department is column 1 it looks like so I'll be using that as the column, adjust as necessary. dgv is what I'm calling the datagridview cboDepartment is what I'm calling the Department combobox for i as integer = 0 to dgv.rows.count if (dgv.Rows(i).Cells(1).Value = cboDepartment.selecteditem.text) dgv.rows(i).visible = true else dgv.rows(i).visible = false next Think that should do it but I haven't tested it at all. This will only hide the row, you can also try to delete that row from the datasource, but that is how I'd find what row to delete still.
In c# you can try with a deconstructor: public static void Deconstruct(this int[] arr, out int a, out int b, out int c) { a = arr[0]; b = arr[1]; c = arr[2]; } and in your code: var (a, b, c) = myFunction(3); but sadly vb.net hasnt support for deconstructors.
Sorry my bad. You could return it as a collection if variable objects. A key pair dictionary would work as well I think. Let me try it in the morning. 
Yes. But I'm not so concerned about the database as the front end development side. I know how forms and queries work and these hopefully are the same in VB.NET but unsure about the reports part. 
And if I use VB.NET with a non-Access DB (MySQL)? 
Sounds like you should be returning an object. Not an array. 
This. But you can also use GDI+ and lots of drawing logic to make your own reports, but that's definitely a far cry from easy. I've done it and it's a nightmare. 
Oh man, that’s nuts! Impressive but nuts! I also imagine if you came up with some kind of text format, maybe in XML, you could come up with a report system that could work with any language providing someone wrote code to write to that file. There must be some that have done that.
As you add each item to the order, you add the value to a separate variable. Such as: sngTotal=sngTotal+sngItemCost Check out this POS sample for a better idea: https://www.fortypoundhead.com/showcontent.asp?artid=24197 
This solution will work. I would suggest that having a separate variable to store the information when the information is easily calculated from the listbox itself increases the complexity of the code with no gain.
Use a sub instead of function. public sub myFunction(byref a as integer, byref b as integer, byref c as integer) a = 0 b = 0 c = 0 end function 
I assume you set the datasource of the chart to SqlDataSource1 at design time because I'm not seeing in it in your runtime. I'm not familiar with DevExpress but for me, changing the chart type to line from bar can also be done at design time. The chart is on your form - right? You can see it and make changes to the properties?
The datasource is set to the pivot grid in the designer. In DevExpress with the pivot grid auto creating the series, everything is one chart type. After playing around with it I think I have to switch the data source to sql source 1 and manually create each series. 
I don't think I would use a Listbox, I would probably use a Listview with **.View** set to **Details**. Also, The total I would have in the separate Textbox control,.. and I'd probably just create a custom control for the whole thing,
I think I'm going to (try) and go for this method I think, I believe it will hit the goals of my assignment the best. I have a very specific format my output is supposed to be in. Thank you so much for the help I appreciate it!
Unfortunately I have to use a listbox as a parameter of the assignment outlines. Thanks for your suggestion though!
Unfortunately this might not give me the format I am required to use. Will this sum the total of all items added to the reciept in one number? Or will it put the running total next to each item in the third column?
 ' Add the total to bottom of listbox. ListBox1.Items.Add("Total....$" &amp; 1000) ' Update total after each item. ListBox1.Items(ListBox1.Items.Count - 1) = "Total....$" &amp; 1000 
Ok, I'll have a medium with peppers, onions and mushrooms. Thanks.
Below is some code which would be how I'd look at this problem. Option Explicit Public Enum PizzaSize Small = 0 Medium = 1 Large = 2 End Enum Public Type Topping Name As String Price(2) As Single End Type Public Type Pizza Price(2) As Single End Type Public Sub Example() Dim APizza As Pizza, Pepperoni As Topping With APizza .Price(0) = 6 .Price(1) = 10 .Price(2) = 15 End With With Pepperoni .Name = "Pepperoni" .Price(0) = 1 .Price(1) = 1.5 .Price(2) = 2 End With MsgBox "A Large pizza with " &amp; Pepperoni.Name &amp; " will cost you: " &amp; Format((APizza.Price(Large) + Pepperoni.Price(Large)), "$#,###.00") End Sub ---- Note that this code uses enumeration, types, and arrays. * Enumerations allow you to assign arbitrary values to keywords, in this case, the values 0-2 representing the sizes of the pizza. * Types allow you to create "objects" that contain other data types. In this case, we have a pizza object that contains the pricing of the different sizes of pizza, and a topping object that stores the pricing and name of a topping. * The arrays used in this example store the different prices of each size of pizza. Now that you have a basic description of each key concept in this, it's easier to tie them all together. If you're still not clear at what each thing does here, ask more questions, and tinker with the code to see how it works.
In your method there is no verifiable chain of events. So you have a variable and they add and remove values from it and for some reason it goes wonky. Tell me how you are going figure out where that is. Its not that the idea was wrong. I just suggested that it added complexity to long term maintenance.
There would be no total per line just a grand total calculated from the values in the item set for the listbox
I came here to say the /u/Abbotn Take my upvote instead!
thank you very much appreciate the help
LOL!
I'm not sure I understand this well. Is the"...." standing in for something or an acctual VB control? And why 1000? 
It's just an example of the text in the receipt. It would look like this: Total....$1000 You would put the actual amount of the total.
This sounds like a great answer but I don't think I quite understand. I am trying to get the sum everytimme someone adds in a new item to the reciept, as a running total. I already have columns (Albeit a different way then this article, so i'll look into it). I also have no idea what the smart tag is. I have been using listbox.items.add(String.format(fmtstring, txtitem.text, txtprice.text) Could you help me with providing which control actually gets you the running total?
I like this, except it may become quite cumbersome depending how many different toppings are allowed. I would have the user input window create a sum of the total toppings ordered, then submit the sum to the subroutine via parameter. From there it is a simple if statement that multiplied that sum by the cost per topping. The actual chosen toppings would be submitted into a text array, comma separated. The sum could be just found from total number of items in the array. 
some people are downvoting this. Jerks.
Did this solve the issue?
In VB.NET is VB Classic?
Ha! Imagine that. Funny thing about computers, they will always do the same things, exactly the same way, over and over again,...even the broken things. ;-) 
I'd start by contacting the company and finding out if they have an API, or more info on interacting with the equipment. If they do, and can provide you with that info, we can probably figure out how to implement that in VB.
I was thinking about this, while it is possible to use a listbox the listview control is a better fit. put a listview and a button on a forum paste this code in Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load ListView1.View = View.Details ListView1.Columns.Add("Item") ' Width of -2 indicates auto-size. ListView1.Columns.Add("Amount") ListView1.Columns.Add("Price") ' Add Items AddItem("Book", 2, 2.99) AddItem("Cup", 4, 2.99) AddItem("Stove", 1, 129) End Sub Private Sub AddItem(item As String, amount As Integer, price As Double) Dim newItem As New ListViewItem newItem.Text = item newItem.SubItems.Add(amount) newItem.SubItems.Add(price) ListView1.Items.Add(newItem) End Sub Private Function CalcTotal() As Double Dim total As Double = 0 For Each item In ListView1.Items total = total + (CInt(item.subitems(1).text) * CDbl(item.subitems(2).text)) Next Return total End Function Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click MsgBox(CalcTotal()) End Sub
Thank you so much for all your help, I really appriciate it! you are right, it's annoying to have to use a listbox if there are better options... But hey, whatever is easiest for them to mark right?
You can do this with a ListBox its just a bit more of a pain to get at the values.
thanks it works now.looks like that did it now 1 more question if i wanted to put a delivery cost in but the cost is based on if a radial button is selected would i have to but a formula on the bottom for it to show up in the label? 
Is it a yes/no radio (I assume you mean radio) button? could you use a checkbox?
Well I don’t want them to pick delivery and pickup 
OK so one radio button is pickup and one button is delivery. The easiest way to do that is to check one of the buttons and see if it's checked (make sure to enforce that one or the other is checked) and just use it's checked value, which will be either true or false. Just make the delivery cost X if it's true or 0 if it's false or whatever logic you want to use.
That’s basically VB Classic or at least mostly compatible. You may wanna check out the VB6 forums at vbforums.com. There’s a vbscript board there, but it’s dead. However the VB6 (VB Classic) is pretty hopping. They may be able to help. Or for paid help you could try freelancer.com, but I’d try those forums first.
Not even close to enough information man. That just looks like SerialPort3 has not been defined as an object someplace. 
I think SerialPort may be a control you need to add to your form first. Not seeing the code I'm guessing.
I am confused. How is what you already made not acceptable?
Was told to make one using arrays
Thanks everyone. I got it
I've only seen it do that when something blocking is happening in code. the blocking code finished, and the screen redraws sharp and clear. so, it's probably your code.
Hmm, It doesnt show any errors or warnings in the errorlist tho :/
Work being done on the UI thread won't cause any kind of error message. Any code you can post to pastebin or similar so we can see?

Thanks I’ll check it out :)
I'm only guessing here. First, you're setting the DGV datasource in Form.load so you don't have to keep setting in every event and If. I think what you're missing after your queries is this: dgvBooks.Refresh()
&gt; Catch ex As Exception &gt; &gt; Exception = ex.Message &gt; &gt; End Try Can you check the exception? 
I assume this is a credit card number? Why are you subtracting one from the card number before converting it to a string? Len(CStr(FullCardNumber - 1)) shouldn't that be Len(CStr(FullCardNumber)) - 1 Why do you need to reverse it? And you want to reverse everything but the check digit at the end?
No error..The DGV just remains the same with all values of my database as queried in Load event: Access.ExecQuery("SELECT * FROM Master ORDER BY Department ASC") FILL DATAGRID dgvBooks.DataSource = Access.DBDT
One question-Does it matter that I both hardcoded my db connection and then also connected it via DataSource by addding a dataset? My thought here was I was going to both hardcode some queries and use query builder on others.
I think I understand, that shouldn't matter, Strange how your DGV isn't updating. Are you sure the queries work and return something? Try moving one to the Form.load event.
Funny...I did just that before your reply....It worked
FullCardNumber can't ever start with a 0 since it is an integer data type. Even if it is all numbers, it should always be represented as a string. A general rule (which can sometimes be broken, but none the less is a good rule to follow) would be that number data should be stored in strings unless you plan on doing math with it. Account numbers are a prime example where strings make more sense than integers.
I didn't have this code anywhere. Not sure where/how I would check. Looking at my DGV properties the datamember tab was empty. I also added that code at the end of the load event and debugged with no help to my situation and then tried it at my rbfall1 query with no help also...
Yeah, I don't use Bindingsources unless I absolutely have to. I use them at design time on DGVs just to see the layout and how it looks, then at runtime I switch it dataset tables and I need.
 Len(CStr(FullCardNumber - 1)) Len(CStr(FullCardNumber) - 1) the first forces FullCardNumber to an int to subtract 1 from it
I believe the only Bindingsource I've used thus far is for my section combbox. I only used it here because once I hardcoded it like I did the other two, it returned all the values/rows in my DB that didn't have a section. Too noob to figure out how to not show those empty values in my drop down combobox list....This is turning out to be alot harder than I'd imagined. I didn't think it would be this hard to query a simple DB to return basic values. Stress/numb butt and back are part of learning I guess
Thanks for trying to help me Abbotn. As someone trying to learn this stuff I really appreciate. My persistence payed off. Of course rookie mistake—I forgot to close dbconnnection in my class where I hardcoded it. Sheesh. Anyhow I’m sure to be back in the near future. Thanks again!
Yeah I have to do calculations with it... it’s a school project but I’m not sure how to fix this problem
It’s a school project so it’s a little weird I have to do calculations such as reversing the number and deviding by the check digit to see if card number is valid. Thanks a lot I appreciate the help now I know how important brackets are XD
Fixed it! Sorry I couldn't post the code, it's kinda classified 
Fixed it! Sorry I couldn't post the code, it's kinda classified 
Here is a simple example https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/38914/A-TCP-IP-Chat-Program 
Ok, it looks like all the players are going to be on the same network because you're explicitly asking for the broadcast IP. That will only work if all PCs are on the same network. Detecting when someone connects is a little bit,...UDPish. UDP is a connectionless protocol. It just sends packets without knowing if they got there. But you could store the IPs of the machines you got packets from, like in a dictionary, and then figure out a way to "connect" them to the actual players. See endPoint.Address With UDP there is no "connection" like TCP. 
You have to select them in the installer, rerun the installer and select them.
For me, I add Dataset to the project and add all the tableadapters, queries and relationships. Then working with multiple dropdown boxes is a lot easier. I have some code at work that I can dress up to domostrate that. It'll have to wait until monday.

Thank you, but my question was where are they and which are they in the installer
I ended up having the same problem, but I already installed everything. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling everything but that didn't work. Ultimately I ended up having to reinstall Windows to fix the problem

It seems to me you are making it more complicated than it needs to be. You could process the data live, and not save it at all. Process a line, save the results somewhere, and then process the next line. That way it doesn't matter how many lines there are, just keep reading til there is no more data. You could output some troubleshooting data (remove it before you submit it to your teacher) and you can see what is going on. As for the output text file, use vbcrlf at the end of the line to break into the next line.
Okay,thank you. I will try this.
Thanks
Personally, I created a library that contains all of the custom controls, and supporting files (graphics, helper classes, etc). Then I just add that library to whatever project needs the controls. If you have a single solution with multiple projects (and no other solutions that need the controls), you can just include the control project in whatever project needs them (this allows you to debug into the controls if you want / need ). If you need the controls in various solutions or projects that aren't related (or don't want to debug into them), then you'll have to compile the library and include the DLL file where you need it.
Without going too deep into the code, curious as to why you are adding 1 to i in the for next loops?
Thanks Bonejob, that did the trick.
This depends on how much you think you will only use some of the controls in different projects. If you are going to use them all, most of the time then a single DLL project is fine. If you think that you will only use some of the controls some of the time, then have a separate DLL for each control so you can mix and match on the fly. This is also weighted against how much code sharing there is between controls. There is no wrong answer here. When in doubt go for maximum flexibility in reuse.
Thanks for the info, I'm going to look into your suggestions!

Ok, so the code I have is fairly complex so I created an example to demonstrate. Fundementally the combo boxes are connected through binding sources. In this example, I created cascading sources through relationships. Public Class Form1 Dim WithEvents CB_State As New ComboBox With {.Location = New Point(13, 13), .Width = 150} Dim WithEvents CB_County As New ComboBox With {.Location = New Point(13, 41), .Width = 150} Dim WithEvents CB_Town As New ComboBox With {.Location = New Point(13, 69), .Width = 150} Dim DS As New DataSet Dim StatesBindingSource As New BindingSource Dim StatesCountiesBindingSource As New BindingSource Dim CountiesTownsBindingSource As New BindingSource Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load ' All of this can/should be done at design time.

i need to make a student number with the year and number they registered so like 2018001 2018002 i already know how to do the year but i cant do the 001 and 002 for what number they register
 Dim x = 1 Dim y = x.ToString("000") 
do you know how to use the listbox 2 determine what number they are? at the end of every student i have =========== then the next one starts so i would like 2 use the listbox 2 determine who registered 1st and second
I'm going to try and read your mind because this post isn't cutting it. I think what you're seeing is the debugging expressions. They only stick around for the life of the visual Studio process. Exit Visual Studio and restart and they should be gone. Also, what you want to do is set the total to zero each time, before the loop. Dim Total As Integer **= 0** Like this: a = InputBox("Enter a number: ") ListBox1.Items.Add(a) Dim Total As Integer = 0 For Each Str As String In ListBox1.Items Total = Total + CInt(Str) Next TextBox1.Text = Total 
 ListBox1.SelectedIndex
it stays after i exit after i restart my computer. so now everytime i have a combo box i get the function telling me how many items i have in the combo box when i dont want it to 
Ok, I see now. Somewhere in your code you are adding a Combobox object to the Listview without specifying **.Text** Like this: Listview1.Items.Add Combobox1 'or Listview1.Items.Add Combobox1.ToString Your application is expecting a string and it's showing you the Object identifier as a string, rather than the contents. The code you posted is fine, it must be somewhere else.

For storing data, a Boolean is best for true / false scenarios. If there are more than two possible outcomes, then I'd opt for an enum (stored as an int). Char isn't appropriate.
Both of your examples are a binary choice. A char stores a single character which has many values. 
Is this really how they teach programming now?
&gt; 1- The answer for a question "Yes" or "No". How many values you need? 2 How many different values has boolean? 2 How many different values has char? 250+ &gt; 2- The result of a search, "Found" or "Not Found" How many values you need? 2 How many different values has boolean? 2 How many different values has char? 250+ 
Any tips or suggestions for what I'm doing?
This works for me. I think your filter is hosed. Dim db As DAO.Database Dim qdf As DAO.QueryDef Dim Filter1 As String Set db = CurrentDb db.QueryDefs.Delete "tempQry" Filter1 = "Employee='Green'" newSQL = "Select * From [Apparatus] where " &amp; Filter1 Set qdf = db.CreateQueryDef("tempQry", newSQL) DoCmd.TransferText acExportDelim, , "tempQry", "C:\Temp\my_data.csv", False 
This hurts my brain,..but I think you want this. Cells(2, 3).Value = "CustomerName" TextName.Text = Cells(2, 3).Value Cells(2, 4).Value = "Customernumber" TextNumber.Text = Cells(2, 4).Value Cells(2, 5).Value = "CustomerAddress" TextAddress.Text = Cells(2, 5).Value 
Yep, that should do it. If you have a default image you want shown when not hovering, just add ``` Dim imgDefault As New Bitmap("path/to/default.png") Private Sub OnToolStripMouseLeave(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Item1ToolStripMenuItem.MouseLeave, Item2ToolStripMenuItem.MouseLeave, Item3ToolStripMenuItem.MouseLeave If PictureBox1.Image IsNot imgDefault Then PictureBox1.Image = imgDefault End If End Sub ```
Thanks for your reply. I don't think that is it though. If I open tempQry from the navigation pain it looks as I expect. If I change newSQL to just "Select * from [AllJobs]" I get the same error. Also, if I use TransferText on some of my other queries it works fine but only for a few of them. That's what makes me think it's some setting on tempQry. 
Damnit, that doesn't seem to work either. I'm stumped why this isn't working. I've seen the exact thing I copy/pasted work in a video. 
.NET chars are actually UTF16 code points and not just single bytes, so they have ~65k possible values. Of course, 250+ is *technically* accurate.
You are my hero, thank you!
Thank you!
Do you have the code?
I started with VB 2.0, yes that long ago, and the mapping is rarely a drive, unless it's MS Access, but even then it seems odd that since you are mapping it to D: is not working. If you get your hands on a decompiler and show JUST the connection code I can be of more help. I FEEL like it's looking for a "server" name that happened to be D... but that is just a guess
Where's the video? Is there a link?
Not sure why you need to build a string if you’re just counting words. Wouldn’t you just use the UBound number minus 1?
Are those variables dimmed? Normally this error is something related to trying to store a too large of a value into a variable. Something like: Dim dbAnnualizedBase as Double or Dim dbAnnualizedBase as Long
Ok, but he did say “counts the number of words”
Found this further up in the code: Dim dbAnnualizedBase As Double Dim dbAnnualizedRecov As Double Dim dbAnnualizedEsc As Double Dim dbAnnualizedMF As Double
Double allows a value from -1.79769313486231570E+308 to 1.79769313486231570E+308. I doubt you are going out of bounds on a simple check of the base value divided by the % for the given year. I think it more likely that you have a loop checking all those values and it is now not large enough for the records in the table. Max value for a Integer is 32767. Check to see if there is a loop that is going beyond the bounds of the INT if there is change it to a long.
I think double is probably correct. Put a breakpoint (F9) on the first line where you get the error and see if you can hover over the values and see what the numbers are.
I didn't made myself clear, actually I want the total length of all the words combined.
dbAnnualizedBase = 170432 dbAnnualizedRecov = 87252.7052647194 dbAnnializedEsc = 0 dbAnnualizedMF = 5153.69410529439
&gt; dbAnnualizedBase = 170432 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dbAnnualizedRecov = 87252.7052647194 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dbAnnializedEsc = 0 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dbAnnualizedMF = 5153.69410529439 
How about this in the For loop: SomeNumberVariable = SomeNumberVariable + Len(Warray(i)) 
Follow a playlist for beginners on YouTube. Worked for me.
 Dim A As String = "This is a wrong format" ' Do while there are two spaces in string, ' Replace them with one space. Do While A.Contains(" ") A = A.Replace(" ", " ") Loop 
Any reason why you using Do While/Loop instead of just While/End While? They both do the same thing, just curious. Also, the word While looks really stupid now that I've typed in this context a few times. :|
Age. Mine. I think Do came before While - force of habit.
 Function RemoveS(sta As String) As String Return EndStr = sta.replace(" ","") End Function I wouldn't bother with a function.
gotcha.
It returned false. I also declared the EndStr = ""
This needs a lot of remediation. But it's 4:55pm so this: Sub receiptWriter(pname As String, pAddress As String, pAdults As Integer, pChildren As Integer) Dim textFileName As String = "d:\My Documents\" + TextBox2.Text System.IO.File.WriteAllText(textFileName, "Mikes Bikes Receipt" &amp; vbCrLf &amp; "Text box text " + TextBox1.Text &amp; vbCrLf &amp; pname &amp; vbCrLf &amp; pAddress &amp; vbCrLf &amp; pAdults &amp; vbCrLf &amp; pChildren) End Sub 
Then you implemented it incorrectly. That function will return a string. What do you mean you declared EndStr = ""? That code requires no modification.
I just tried this and it works. You can reshape the code to make it more clear. Function RemoveS(sta As String) As String Dim Enstr as string = sta.replace(" ","") Return EndStr End Function
Come on dude first google. CInt(Math.Ceiling(Rnd() * 800000)) + 100000
This /u/Abbotn guy always in before I get a chance :P
I would like yo get your perspective of my code as well I have re written it into one code if you would like to see it but I am having one main issue with which is some protection level thing when trying to declare a variable
Sure man make a post to a https://pastebin.com/ and send me the link. I am online for a bit.
What’s wrong with the Random class? It does exactly what it says. 
Sorry daddy. :*
Your a bit of a dick dude. We are trying to help here.
Or maybe I don’t support questions that get asked all the time on MSDN or pop up 500 results on Google. If he was asking how to make a file verification system then surely I would collaborate as not everyone is doing it. But for something like this is almost like asking how to turn on a computer. Randoms are a core feature of every language. I am pretty sure you don’t want yourself or this whole sub to be someone’s personal API. And I wasn’t being anymore of a dick than the guy who first stated to use Google. I don’t understand why you can’t make API searching a rule, that way we can weed out these questions and expose questions that are more complex.
 Are you joking? Write the code, if it doesn't work, come back and we'll help you with errors. You're first line of text..."Needs to be Year 11 standard Read task below" Pretty ignorant. Needs to be?? Write the code yourself, we aren't your homework buddies. 
I was a teacher for a while and this post really gets under my skin... No attempt at all, which is sad given the generous time allocation: &gt;Time allocation: Four (working) weeks Pseudocode and documentation due 23th March; Source code and Evaluation due 29th March. I'm gonna take a wild guess here and say that this is a NSW Software Design and Development assessment task for Stage 5. I'm sure your teacher would have a problem with you posting the whole question here and asking someone to provide a "Year 11 standard" of work can be considered blatant plagiarism and could result in academic misconduct.
I'm fine with that. I don't mind home work questions, unless it's, "hey can you code this for me?". But if there is some code, and it's not working, i.e. effort has been made, then it's all good.
umm well your mom gay lol!
guys i've legit tried everything nothing works and i'm going on holiday soon
just some help to get me started
lol faggot our teacher told us to try and see if anyone would help, smh
If you tried everything it would be working. You can always take the class next year.
If you post what you've done so far and ask very specific questions then you might get more help than this. Just posting your whole assessment task notice isn't going to get you anywhere. Also if you were really worried, you should have posted about this 3 weeks ago (or at the very least, asked your teacher for a hand).
I doubt highly that your teacher would have told you to post the whole assessment task notice and see if people will do your work for you. What you should be doing is making your very best attempt and asking specific questions based on what you exactly need help with. You need to submit your own work for assessments - regardless of what anyone tells you, it is a requirement of your HSC that you don't plagiarise work or turn in someone else's work as yours. Besides, nobody will learn anything by doing it this way...
LOL help? Sounds like asking to do the assignment for you
Yeah this is true, but i really just couldn't be bothered, so i thought you guys (nerds) would have fun doing it for me
bro i have been trying to do it for those 3 weeks numpty, and i dont have a windows pc at home so i can only do it at school. 
i have a combobox, textbox and 2 inputboxes i think theyre called. i just dont know how to link them together and i also dont know how to write the code for combobox too set the values 
3 weeks?! Try [this](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=http%3A%2F%2Fnet-informations.com%2Fq%2Ffaq%2Fcombovalue.html).
LOL! I have some downtime now at work.
No
 If "EverythingIsAnObject".Contains("Object") Then MsgBox("Yes") End If
See that was my plan man, help you with work :P
Ok 
Your frustrations with others laziness is not healthy, you can not control people, you cant make them do anything. All you can do is help, not helping does not make them better. Supply the help and then tell them how to get it themselves next time. I was a bit more blunt than I usually am because it bothers me as well. I just accept what is and move on.
Without seeing any code, at the very **least**/*silly*/^ugly you should be able to reference the inventory form controls like this: InventoryForm.PillsCountTextbox.Text = Cint(InventoryForm.PillsCountTextbox.text) - Cint(PaymentSellingForm.PillsSoldTextbox.Text) 
You need three picturebox controls. Then you use the click event on the pictureboxes to set or change the picture that's shown. The rest is just working out the logic of what to do with the pacman and the smiley face, depending on the the image that's currently set in the smiley picturebox. It's a lot more simple than it seems. Don't stress too hard about it. Read your text book. Pay attention in class. Most of all, put yourself in the computer's shoes. What instructions is it going to do when certain events are fired. You'll kick ass at this. Best of luck. 
Thanks for the help, much appreciated! :D
You had 4 weeks to do this. Now you have 3 days for Pseudo code and Doc, and a week for Source code. It took you 3 weeks just to create this Reddit account. 
It's my graduation project 
Close, your array is declared MyArray but you're loop references myTable. Sub FillArray() Dim EndStr As Long ' What's this for? Randomize() For i = 0 To 100000 MyArray(i) = Int((900000 * Rnd()) + 100000) Next End Sub 
Suggest a decompiler?
Sorry, the last time I used a VB decompiler was in the 90s, so I can't be help there.
So are you inferring that you have a Mac? If so, download virtualbox and install windows on the VM. Then you can install your student Visual Studio application and you are off to the races. Works for Linux too.
That went way over my dumb brain lol, but I can understand the concept and get some great ideas from that. Thanks! 
Do you have Discord?
No I don't have discord. GaryNMaine's comment above holds a possible answer. Update the record in the inventory for the pills sold.
Try this, or a variant thereof: UPDATE [Inventory] INNER JOIN [Payment] ON Inventory.MedicineID = Payment.MedicineID SET [AvailableArr] = [AvailableArr] - [Amount] WHERE [Inventory].[MedicineID] = [Payment].[MedicineID];
Will your data appear in the middle of the spreadsheet as shown in the image? Or will it be starting from A1? And will the new data always have today's date?
[AvailableArr] Should I leave this one as it is or change it to [Available Amount] as I have it in my table?
That syntax is so far off from what VB6 can parse that it will do him no good at all. VB6 didn't even allow you to declare a variable and assign it a value in the same line of code, didn't use sender and eventargs in event procedures, didn't have handles clauses, etc.
LOL! Wow!
Yeah, well, I would have used the runSQL command in VBA, not sure what to do with VS2017.
Thanks for everything. I'll keep on researching. This is going to be harder than I've imagined.
I said programming at this level. It's not the specific thing you don't know its the basic concepts you are missing. Your question revolves around data storage and how to remove an item from it. That is basic bread and butter code man. You are binding to data sets, and the first thing you learn about data is CRUD (Create, Update, Delete). Well that an the first google hit for; **vb.net bound dataset delete record** Is the correct answer.
It's a bit late then to come a few days before the assessment is due and ask for help. If you didn't have a Windows PC then maybe you should have asked on this subreddit how you could do Visual Basic programming on your home computer. Sorry, no sympathy at all here from me - you are trying to get this finished at the last minute and the original post does not ask anyone for help but implies that you want someone to do it "to a Year 11 standard". I had students do this all of the time to me, and I just don't stand for it. I do, however, hope that you get through this and the next time you (1) are better prepared and (2) you ask for help in the correct way. I apologise for coming across harsh, but this isn't the way to ask for help (and name calling is definitely not acceptable).
Looks like you are missing the &amp; in your string settings to concatenate the different string pieces. Like.. arytext(4) = "one" &amp; textbox2.text &amp; "**" 
That's what it was, I figured it was something simple, but it's been so long since I used VB it had slipped my mind. Thank you!!!!
Giving someone a VB2013 answer to their VB6 homework problem might actually be secretly brilliant: The student still has to write their own code, but Abbotn has given him help figuring out what sort of thing he's trying to do.
So you bought the interface, but what about the source code? You have the code and an environment setup to make changes and recompile it? If it was bought a "long time ago", what version of VB was it built in because they can change what the answer would be. Assuming you do have the ability to modify the source code, on the "full automation" side of things, you would need to find out if the phone system has any sort of COM based or .NET based (again depending on what VB version it was written in) API for 3rd party interoperability with the phone system software. If it does then it would be reasonable to believe they would provide a way, either by subscribing to an event listener through their API, or via polling, to grab data about an incoming call and feed it into your system where you would write code to do a customer lookup and prepopulate their information. On a "semi automated" side of things, in the event there is no such API or you don't have access to it without buying something from the phone system maker, you could just modify the code of your menu system so that the user still has to enter the incoming phone number, but using that info, the rest is queried from the database and prepopulated into your ordering form.
Reverse the for: pactop = frmpacmove.ScaleHeight - imgpacup.height For p =pactop To 0 Step -0.005 imgpacup.Move 0, p Next p 
I don't know if this helps but if you put .ToString("D2") on your integer variable it will always display to numbers. So if you have '9' you'll get '09'. I bet there's an equal for what you need.

I think for complex text replacement you'll need to use Regex to handle it. Why are you using a RichText editor for plain text, and more importantly, why are you editing XML in the UI? Does the user actually need to interact with the XML. What about the user removing markup and breaking the XML? I'd read the data from the XML file (using one of the built in XML readers) into a proper set of classes that represent the items that need to be changed, then you can manipulate those objects, and save the XML file from those corrected objects. If you only need to change the formatting and re-save the file, then I'd probably just read it into an XML document, manipulate the document, and save it. Without seeing the actual XML created, it's hard to say, but I'd guess that the reason that IE won't open the XML file is that it's not actually XML, but text with some XML like brackets. Adding an XML extension to a file doesn't magically make it valid XML, you need proper formatting and XML declarations in the file. 
1. [Parse the string to its numerical representation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/?term=decimal.tryparse) 2. [Format it as a string in the desired way](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/custom-numeric-format-strings)
Ok I will give it a try next time I’m on the project and tell ya how it works, thanks a lot!!
I only added the rich text box as a way to see the changes made to file. The user can´t change the file through it. All the process is done by a button wich autmatically replaces the text that needs to be changed. Also I haven´t really worked with xmls on VB untill know so I´m not sure how to proceed exactly.
See if this works in 2010, it does for me in 2013. CSng(".99").ToString("F2")
so many broken wow
I would've done this in a timer which disables upon reaching the desired location but if using a loop you could add a delay using Threading.Thread.Sleep(delayInMs)
For p = 0 To pactop Step 0.005 imgpacup.Move 0, p Threading.Thread.sleep(50) Next p
Most welcome!
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.xmldocument(v=vs.110).aspx That will get you an overview of the XMLDocument. You should be able to load the file into it, and then work your way through the doc looking for the elements you need. 
I cleaned it up a little. It will at least run now and I think it do what you asked for. You must not have pasted all of the code, but I hope this helps.

Yes.
Thanks for the help! Ill check that this works when i get off work in a few hours. I realized i didnt finish the end of it where it pastes the answers into textboxes. Im pretty sure thats all im missing.
How do I do that?
That’s what an API is for, that is your documentation. Unless you have confused API with undocumented wrapper.
I’m on the mobile app. Is the side accessible from the mobile app or do I need to be on my desktop computer?
Didn't realize that. Not sure about what's available on Mobile, but here's the link: https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Visual-Basic-Fundamentals-for-Absolute-Beginners When you have a chance to log in from a browser, there's more links on the sidebar, but that's a good starting point.

Good on you for figuring it out! It feels good to solve a problem. 
I think this is wrong, if 4 adults then always 2 children? No. Child = txtChild.Text Child = Adult / 2 Try this instead: Child = txtChild.Text * .5 I think that should work, right? 
Hey, the code i submitted works(yours would also work) it's just the other sections i cant figure out. What to do if the user wants just Adult tickets or just child tickets.
For an answer sans flippancy. First you'll need to download and reference the Newtonsoft.json package. You can get that through the NuGet Package manager. Here is a sample I put together: Imports Newtonsoft.Json Imports Newtonsoft.Json.Linq Imports System.Net Imports System.Text Public Class Form Dim oWebClient As New WebClient() Public Class ticker Public Property id As String Public Property name As String Public Property symbol As String Public Property rank As String Public Property price_usd As String Public Property price_btc As String Public Property h24_volume_usd As String Public Property market_cap_usd As String Public Property available_supply As String Public Property total_supply As String Public Property max_supply As String Public Property percent_change_1h As String Public Property percent_change_24h As String Public Property percent_change_7d As String Public Property last_updated As String End Class Private Sub Form_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load Dim aData() As Byte = {} Dim myTickers() As ticker aData = oWebClient.DownloadData("https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/?limit=10") If aData.Length &gt; 0 Then myTickers = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(Of ticker())(Encoding.ASCII.GetString(aData)) For Each t As ticker In myTickers Debug.Print(t.symbol) Next End If End Sub End Class 
Awesome thank you so much
No. Your math would work with my line of code when children or adults is zero.
Well you can call another macro (VBA function) from another workbook, the limitation is that the workbook you want to act on must be open as well.
[Kevin Drumm](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSX3MR0gnKDxyXAyljWzm0Q/playlists) posts some great tutorials of computer science concepts for beginners, all done in VB.net. I learned a lot from his channel. 
you not define what kind of variable vartype and varsize were.
When you’re viewing the sub directly in the app tap the three dots in the upper right hand corner and select Community Info to view sidebar info.
I really appreciate the information thank you
I’m not seeing community info but I’ll keep poking around and will definitely use my laptop 
Are you on the r/visualbasic subreddit page? Like, not just in this thread, but viewing the entire sub where you can see all posts listed?
Do you have a reference to the Microsoft DAO library in Tools&gt;References...?
If you're using Reddit is Fun, go to the main subreddit page and click on the little i in a circle next to the subreddit name. That'll let you access the sidebar.
I believe your error is caused by your 2 optional parameters. A) they do not have data types and b) the do not have default values. Should be something like. Optional vartype as string = "", optional varsize as integer = 4. And c) since its a function you need a return.. so after the ) of the function.. as string or what ever the return is. And you exit the function.. but you are not returning anything.. replace the exit function with return true (if this is a boolean)
I found it thank for the help.

Your messed up the formatting and I am too lazy to decrypt what it actually means, but I suggest you look into the String.Split() function that takes a char or String as parameter as split delimiter and returns a String array of substrings split by that defined delimiter. This almost solves the problem as long as you know how to handle an array.
Yeah you're right, i didnt test the program properly. I was testing 1 Adult 1 Child but then i did 1 Adult 2 child and the result was the same, now i see the issues thanks heaps! :) i should of done more tests...
Idk mainly because it worked the first time, i did 1 adult and 1 child and then 2 adult and 2 child and it worked, however when i did 1 Adult 2 child the result was the same. just assumed it was okay because it worked with some tests, it was my bad
:) Is it all fixed now?
Yeah, if the person leaves one blank I’ll have to tell them to at least put 0 in the box.
There is a VBA subreddit. R/vba. 
&gt; UPDATE [Inventory] INNER JOIN [Payment] ON Inventory.MedicineID = Payment.MedicineID SET [AvailableArr] = [AvailableArr] - [Amount] WHERE [Inventory].[MedicineID] = [Payment].[MedicineID] A follow up to this, I have my Medicine ID written as Medicine ID not MedicineID, should I write it as I have it or as you wrote it?
here is what I would do. I would set up a table for usernames, with a checkbox for admin or not in the database itself. Use whatever account you want to log in to the database, but then ask the user to enter a name and a password and check that against the table you have created. Bonus points for hashing the password
In the programming word, we want the program to handle all of the possible inputs. So if someone enters a negative number it doesn't take the input, yes? What I like to do is make a validation routine, it checks to see if the value of each checkbox is 0 or &gt; 0 and then it turns on the "next"button or whatever you are using, so you will always get valid data. You could also just check and see if the textbox is blank. If it's blank give the variable a value of 0.
No clue, because your question does not make any sense.
Maybe he should call her.
Ditto.
Damn, that’s deep.
don't forget that .text is a text (i.e. string) so really it should be "0". I think the .text supports .isnumeric so you could say: if not (txtAdult.text.isnumeric) and not (txtChild.text.isnumeric) then You could also set the value of child and adult as 0 in the declarations, and then only set the variables to the value of the textbox if it is numeric. Good job.
The data is all user entered. Upon clicking another button, the information is added to the list. I figured contains was the wrong way to go, I also tried using finditemwithtext to no avail.
Hmmm, might wanna check out vbforums.com if you don’t find an answer here. There’s a great VB6 section with people using it that love to help.
Have you heard about LINQ? That should help you: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32508218/vb-net-using-linq-to-get-data-from-listview
Well this is a school project and the requirements call for the user to input the data in this way, unfortunately.
When using a listview, you might have to use a for loop for each listview item, and then parse those by subitem 
It is for this reason that I don't use listviews. I use Datasets and Datagirdviews.
Help with what? Doing your homework? At the very least, drop this into visual studio and see what it's throws at you? Some of the issues are subtle, but most are blazingly obvious if you've done any coding with vb.net at all. Or ask a more specific question as to what you're stuck with.
OP - you can't just dump your coding and say "fix this." You'll find a lot of value in learning now just how to develop software, but also how to ask for assistance in your development process. An example, would be for one of your questions, that you expect X to happen, but for "some reason", Y is happening instead. It's tough to "fix" something when nobody knows what "right" looks like but you. My experience is that developers are always eager to assist other developers, but you, as the "helpee" need to put in the required leg work, first.
This is what I have so far 1. Inventory is not declared. The dollar sign symbol after ‘decPurchase$ is incorrectly placed. Shop *= . 0.7 is incorrect. The period shouldn’t be placed where it is placed. 2. Batting average is not declared in decBattingAverage = BattingAverage(decHits, decTimesAtBat) It should be = decBattingAverage(decHits, decTimesAtBat) 3. decMilesPer = Compute(decMiles, decGallons) This statement is wrong because it should be decMilesPer = Compute(decMilesPer, decGallons) The following line of code is wrong as well, decMPG = decMPG / decg The decg value should be decGallons. Finally, the last line of text Return MilesPerGallon is not a defined variable.

I'm sure naming conventions are going to be considered bugs (where you are told to declare your variables with a prefix to what they represent). For example str for Strings, int for Integers, I see a few there that while the code would work, the instructor may be looking for you to catch these inconsistencies. Also, what does the Tap event do? 
 For index As Integer = myListView.Items.Count - 1 To 0 Step -1 If myListView.Items(index).SubItems(1).Text = someText Then msgbox(index) End If Next index
The .contains only accepts a value as object, and won’t allow a string. Any ideas to circumvent this? 
UWP (Universal Windows Platform) is a subset of .NET, allowing the developer to write once for Desktop, Mobile, XBox, Hololens, etc. I started VB with version 2.0, and moved to C# over 5 years ago, and it SEEMS so has the majority of developers... just food for thought
Is this the error that happens when you try to load the form?
Nope but I just figured it out! The libraries weren’t the same. Just aligned those across files and things seem to work now.
You're coming from VB6 to VB.NET? Really? You haven't used Visual Studio at all since it was VB6? I don't believe it.

Truth is truth. I was exposed to VB on a job and continued to use it for a personal / shareware project, but my day job(s) have since been all web based client / server stuff. Considering rebooting my wares for fun and shoring up skill set again.
what "team" is the survey assuming?!
Thanks for the help, but it was a bit to comolex, I couldn’t understand
I assume the Windows Form App and the Console App both fall under the Windows Forms category?
Nope, I just forgot about console apps.
My Windows Mobile phone will still get monthly updates until early 2019. (It's actually more reliably secure than any Android phone, update-wise.) Rumor is Andromeda will be out sometime this year, taking the "mobile" torch for Microsoft. One thing I'd add, is that the VB language team is pretty active/conversational over at github.com/dotnet/vblang and there's a lot of discussion about what VB should be in a C# dominated world. ;)
Does the link still work if you paste it into a browser directly? It's possible that USP has changed the parameters and the formatted URL no longer works. Can you post the contents of a "Link" variable that doesn't work? 
It's complex in that example because all done in run time. Almost all of it can be done at design and zero code is required to maintain the user experience. * Two combo boxes * You have two tables * You need one relationship. The first combo box is bound to the Dept table and selects the Dept. The second combo box is bound to the relationship and selects the email.
Thank you for your response. Her is what I get in the address line... https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupResultsAction!input.action?resultMode=0&amp;companyName=&amp;address1=123%20ANYWHERE%20STREET&amp;address2=&amp;city=Jackson%20Township&amp;state=NJ&amp;urbanCode=&amp;postalCode=&amp;zip=08527 
Since that link doesn't work when you click on it, it's something wrong with the formatting of the link or the USPS website no longer works the way it used to. I agree with u/Abbotn, in that you'll likely need to rewrite using the current USPS API. 
Thanks you guys I was afraid of that.
Thank you I was afraid of that.
Can you show what code you have so far?
There are plenty of ways to do this and which way is ideal would depend on how your code is structured. You could do something like have 2 arrays, one is the "undealt" and the other is the "dealt" array, and as you deal cards, you remove from the undealt array and place it in the dealt array. Once your undealt array is at 0 (or depending on the game, once your array hits less cards than you need to deal a new hand), you shuffle the dealt array and reassign it to the undealt array to start again.
you could make a list of available cards. Pick a card between 0 and number of remaining cards. Display that car, pull it out of the pile. Go again.
Each card should be represented either as an object or, if you want to be really old school about it, as a unique integer. Deck is a list that holds the cards. When a card is drawn, the corresponding object should be removed from the deck using the List.RemoveAt method. 
Haven't seen this method. I will definitely look into this. Thanks!
I agree with /u/PostalElf. I use this method. There are so many better options than simple arrays, a List is one. Once you pick a card, do a List.RemoveAt and then pick the next random number between 1 and List.Count. Just don't forget to reload the List before shuffling.
Shuffle the deck before you start, and just step through the cards in order. If you need to remove items, check out the [List](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6sh2ey19(v=vs.110).aspx) class. It's much better than trying to do all this stuff with arrays.
Thank you!
What do you do with **knownips.txt**? Is it just to hold the results? Can it be xml?
Yep just to hold the results. So if someone goes to do a lookup on an ip that’s already been looked up, it will show up in the nslookup ps results twice. I guess it could be xml but the power shell script I’m using now references .txt files. I can post the ps code in a few if that will help. Thanks.
it would probably be easier to have the ps1 script do the displaying too. shell()'ing the ps script is easy enough, but capturing its output, or even just telling when it's done, is harder. `Read-Host -Prompt` in ps isn't working? that seems odd.
That would be fine. I just need an easier/cleaner way to A input the ip without having to manually open the inputips.txt file and add before manually running the ps script. And B have the result of the ps script automatically go to the knownips.txt file if its not already a duplicate/already in there. I can get powershell to output the results to the text file. I'm just not sure how to get it to go there without it being for every result, dup or not. I figured that could be done easier in vb, but wasn't sure. 
Here is what the ps script does. $stop = $args.Count $inputIP = "" $inputFile = "input_ips.txt" $knownIPFile = "knownips.txt" $showUsage = 0 $verbose = 0 for ($i = 0; $i -lt $stop; $i++) { if ($args[$i] -eq "-f") { if ( ($i + 1) -eq $stop) { $showUsage = 1 } else { $i++ $inputFile = $args[$i] } } elseif ($args[$i] -eq "-k") { if ( ($i + 1) -eq $stop) { $showUsage = 1 } else { $i++ $knownIPFile = $args[$i] } } elseif ($args[$i] -eq "-verbose") { $verbose = 1 } else { if ( ($i + 1) -eq $stop) { $inputIP = $args[$i] } else { $showUsage = 1 } } } if ($stop -eq 0) { $showUsage = 1 } if ($showUsage) { Write-Host "Usage: ip_lookup.ps1 [-multiline] [-k &lt;KNOWN_IP_FILE] -f &lt;FILENAME&gt;" Write-Host " ip_lookup.ps1 [-multiline] [-k &lt;KNOWN_IP_FILE] &lt;IP_ADDRESS&gt;" Write-Error "Bad Input" exit } $knownIPs = @{} function LoadKnownIPs($knownIPList) { # File should be IP&lt;TAB&gt;Description $reader = [System.IO.File]::OpenText($knownIPList) $line = $reader.ReadLine() while( $line) { $result = $line.Split("`t") if ($result.Count -le 2) { $knownIPs[$result[0].Trim()] = $result[1] } else { Write-Output ("-" + $result[0].Trim() + "-") Write-Output "Error at $line with " + $result.Count } $line = $reader.ReadLine() } $reader.Close() } if ( $knownIPFile -ne "" ) { LoadKnownIPs($knownIPFile) } function LookupIP($ip) { $result = nslookup $ip 2&gt; $null | select-string -pattern "Name:" if ( ! $result ) { $result = "" } $result = $result.ToString() if ($result.StartsWith("Name:")) { $result = $result.Split() $result = $result[$result.Count -1 ] } else { $result = "NOT FOUND" } $knownMatch = "" if ($knownIPs.ContainsKey($ip)) { $knownMatch = $knownIPs[$ip] } if ($verbose) { Write-Output $ip Write-Output $result Write-Output $knownMatch } else { Write-Output "$ip `t $result `t $knownMatch" } } if ( $inputFile -ne "") { $reader = [System.IO.File]::OpenText($inputFile) $line = $reader.ReadLine() while( $line) { LookupIP $line.Trim() $line = $reader.ReadLine() } $reader.Close() } else { LookupIP $inputIP }
Do you have **Visual Studio**?
yessir
it should be able to show the picture in a picture box after the user has selected it form their computer
You should be able to use YourComboboxControl.SetFocus After you put the input into the listbox.
Look into [SetFocus](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-basic-6/aa244175(v=vs.60\))
Ack, was so close. Thanks a lot stranger :)
Yes, this. An arrayList is a nice data structure for this. I'm not sure you need to have two lists. Perhaps you only need an unanswered list.
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=display+image+input+of+a+file+dialog+box+vb
Well give him an upvote at least.
You should be able to just use continue while so.... While i= 1 if blnQA1 = False &lt;do something&gt; else Continue While end if end using 
I don't exactly know your issue, but this is my code (words made ambigious for confidentiality sake): Private Sub addbtn_Click() Dim i As Integer On Error GoTo AddItem For i = LBound(ListBox1.List) To UBound(ListBox1.List) If ListBox1.List(i) = ComboBox1.Value Then MsgBox "[duplicate error message]" Exit Sub End If Next i AddItem: ListBox1.AddItem (ComboBox1.Value) ComboBox1.SetFocus ComboBox1.Value = vbNullString End Sub This button is set to Default in the Properties Pane. It's probably not exactly how you'd want to do it, but it's whats working for me
Not enough info to answer. 1st, we're talking about VBA here (VB.Net is different is just uses .Focus) 2nd, is it not working or does it just not show up in intellisense? (there's issues with modeless dialogs) 3rd, if it's not showing up, did you try it anyway? sometimes intellisense goes wonky. At least in my experience with it in vba if none of these apply, offer some more info or something we can try on our end to see if we can duplicate the issue. 
I didn't even think VBA vs VB.net. I'll recreate it later today and post what I have. Thanks. 
I should be mad but that is the first time I have heard of that website so for that I am thankful
If it's a SQL database then there is a lot of documation about extracting data from certain columns on MSDN
if your using access, then yes, make a query. you can view the results right there without the form, or make a form or report or whatever you want. 
What I would start off with is query the 4 columns (getting all rows. Don't worry about specifics right now) Here's a quick example: in the class scope of the form Dim dt as new DataTable In the Forms Load event Dim conStr as String = "This is where your connection string goes to gain access to your database" Using con As New OleDb.OleDbConnection(conStr) Using da As New OleDbDataAdapter("This is where you would write your query", con) da.Fill(dt) DataGridView1.DataSource = dt End Using End Using create a DataTable with a wide enough scope to be used in other events throughout the form. Slap a datagridview on your form (this is just to get you started) Now execute your query using a OldDbDataAdapter and fill the datatable. Then assign the datatable as your datagridview's Datasource. Upon running the application, you should have a datagridview filled with your columns. Now here is where it can be limited to specific data... Slap a textbox on your form and set a row filter in the textchanged event Private Sub TextBox1_TextChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles TextBox1.TextChanged dt.DefaultView.RowFilter = "FirstName LIKE '" &amp; TextBox1.Text &amp; "%'" End Sub This assumes you have a column called firstname, otherwise change it to the name of the column you want to filter by. Run the program and start typing James in the textbox and you should see the datagridview only showing data that meets the filter criteria. This is just a quick and dirty way of doing something like you asked. 
Great answer Charlie
OpenFileDialog
Thanks, this was very helpful, I achieved what I wanted :)
depend on what database you're using. look for a binary type and examples for loading it. it's usually a bit of a pain.
Do you have a dataset? Or where does the datagridview get it's information?
Yes, a dataset from an access db
are you doing this in access forms/vba or vb.net?
I'm not sure I understand the question. I've done the table first in access but the program itself I'm doing in visual studio/visual basic Windows forms. So the access dB was added as a datasource to the project in visual studio.
You have to serialize the file to a binary stream and store it in a blob. Do NOT do this if you are using Access, SQLite, or similar database. It is super slow. https://www.codeguru.com/columns/vb/working-with-blobs-and-vb.net.htm In reality it is easier to copy the file from your source location to a directory that you can share and then point the pathing in the database to the new location.
Me too. 
It's great when you finally get it working after some intricate complicated bug. But if it's something simple that took you several hours to track down, you bang your head on the desk. lol. I've had both kinds of bugs many times.
What sucks is that you get so excited about it that you just want to tell everyone. And nobody gets it/cares. :'(
So, calculator or macro?
That’s true, just the process of learning.
I care Trekkie, I care...
The worst is when you copy and paste code to use for different variables, and you forget to change the details on the copied code. If x &gt; Width then x = Width If x &lt; 0 then x = 0 If y &gt; Height then x = Width If y &gt; Height then x = 0 Guess how man hours it took me to figure out this silliness one day?
Programming is an art. It is sculpture. It is painting and calligraphy. It is poetry, it is composing a novel and a symphony. It is a love song, jazz and rock and roll. Water colors and oil. Wood, granite, marble and clay. It is tears of joy and despair. Programming is an art.

Everything in the code behind a form has access to all controls on the form. You can pass controls themselves, or their values, as parameters to procedures/functions in the same form based on what you want to do with the input. I put in two ways you can do this one, one procedure with parameters like your sample and one procedure that does not have parameters. I also included code that doesn't use variables. If you want to do something with a control on a different form or use procedures/functions in other places it's more complicated, but it can be done. This is all within one form. There is no error checking beyond what you provided, this code will break when someone types in anything non-numeric. Large numbers will break the Single data type.

After 20+ years writing code I can tell you there is still imense satisfaction when a program works and is used. Congrats
What I do is write programs that process the different file structures in my work life into files that can easily be imported with the normal tools of the database system. I deal with a lot of files that have the craziest structures to them. When I need to get the data into my SQL Sever, I write an app that processes and extracts the data into a Tab delimited file. Then I use BCP to import it in SQL Server. BCP is extremely fast.
I had some code that wasn't working because I had a "Case 0 Or 1", which, of course, I meant "Case 0, 1". And that caused me problems for... months.
thank you!

Basic is a reference to it's origins more so than a description of it's capabilities today. While there may be some things that make it simpler to read/use that doesn't mean that it's not fully capable of doing anything you want want, including creating malicious software.
I tried it but the instructions weren't very clear on how to actually do it.
&gt; The little I know about vb is that its a very basic language. Then you know nothing about VB. VB is actually one of the most sophisticated languages available that's commonly used in production. Excepting C#, of course, no other commonly used language has such a wide variety of OOP, FP, declarative, set-based, statically typed, and dynamically typed capabilities. The only thing "basic" about it is that its core syntax was inspired by the BASIC/FORTRAN style rather than the C-style that is more popular today. 
Cool. Hey, don't forget,...in the Subtract and Divide functions, you might want to check for which Num variable is larger and not zero. Computers don't like dividing by zero, it's a math thing.
**Then you know nothing about VB!** FTFY 
Maybe try Worksheets("[Worksheet1]").Protect "[Password]", userinterfaceonly:=True, DrawingObjects:=True I know it should default to "True", but DrawingObjects is the parm that controls the feature you're describing, so that's the best suggestion I can come up with.
Ill try this on Monday thanks a lot
So what error is your program throwing? These types of things usually cause some error message to be thrown out to the user. An example of your code you're using to attempt this and perhaps some example data that fails would benefit us in being more helpful. Lastly, why are you asking us where your database resides? 
maybe try refreshing the fields of your data set query in studio?
Is this in Word? Excel? Something else?
Are you trying to do this from VB.NET or VBA?
I don't know of any so I created a new one and if enough people join it could actually be useful: https://discord.gg/5eWxHNU
joined :)
Your code is extremely hard-coded. Assuming that cblev1(x,x) is based on some kind of logic you can do all of this dynamically using AddHandler x, AddressOf x
Ah dang I could do it from VB.NET but not VBA :(
Post your code FFS.
So TryParse returns a boolean result and upon a successful parse, stores the value into the variable. This means that you can do something like: Dim numgallons As Double = 0 Dim nummiles As Double = 0 Dim mpg As Double = 0 If Not Double.TryParse(txtNumGallons.Text, numgallons) MessageBox.Show("Your input in invalid") Exit Sub End If So if the input can successfully be parsed to a type Double, that result is stored into numgallons and the error message is skipped. If false, 0 is stored in numgallons and the user is prompted with an error that the input was invalid. 
It was a longshot. Your problem doesn't make a whole lot of sense, i.e., you're doing it right AFAICT. If you can be arsed--but I can definitely see why you wouldn't want to be--you might try to get to the bottom of it. There is something fundamentally wrong somewhere, either with Excel or with an assumption.
there's several ways to do this, so it's better to start with what exactly isn't working for you. post your code. use reddit's formatting markup, or use a pastebin. if you're using office OLE to call up a running outlook, in some cases outlook will prompt for permission, and it won't always pop to the front so look for it in your taskbar. if outlook isn't already running, the email will just go into your outbox and start there until you manually open outlook and a send/receive happens.. also you need to tell us what VB you're using. it 100% matters.
Hey Charlie, No, unfortunately my debug.print results weren't what I expected. From what I can tell, it's adding that new entry, and then on the second iteration of the for each loop, for whatever reason, it doesn't see that the ID exists, and adds it yet again. All of the -1's in the debug.print is it adding another row.
click a line and press F9 to toggle a breakpoint. You should see a red dot appear in the left side of the code window. &gt;would help since I know what's happening - I just don't know why. This is why you need to step through. At the point where a new row is added something should happen or you should know something should be a certain way and reviewing this during execution can help you discover where it's not happening. 
Someone in my first link said that .net does support them, but that post was from almost 10 years ago so it's possible that newer versions lost support for them. I guess my question for you then is what's the benefit to declaring with the types vs. declaring with one of the identifiers? i.e., what's the benefit to Dim i as Double vs. Dim i#
Thanks Charlie! I'll give that a go and report back!
IMO, readability. 
 I was using [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pNKyVGFTpA) code, I checked my outbox and there's nothing there. I am using Visual Basic 2017.

Oh god, that's terrible. Those shouldn't even exist much less be used. You should never sacrifice readability to save a few keystrokes. This is a personal preference but I hate having to type a lot of symbols in code. I would much rather use words. Regular expressions are my personal nightmare.
I can't exactly tell what's going on, mainly because I don't know what cblev1 does. But I would generate a random number for each part then assign them from lowest to highest number in the slots. Maybe add a number for the blank space if it needs to be random as well.
If I'm interpreting his solution right my approach would be to just pass the button clicked on, have the function search for the empty square, check if the clicked button can be slid there, then slide if applicable. That's probably doable for him without learning something new (which he definitely should but I don't know what programming concepts he would be able to grasp). But for someone just starting out his solution is pretty good. I don't even want to think of some of the stuff I wrote when I was starting out. I don't know about adding handlers, I've never used them myself. That's another topic for me to look into.
Just look at the Mail class, it has good documentation and a ton of examples.
Thank you. After that, everytime I run the program it gives me this error "System.FormatException: 'Input string was not in a correct format.'" Any Suggestions?
VB in my opinion is a great language even for desktop applications and easy to learn. I recommend you Visual Basic Express 2008 or 2010, it's relatively lightweight, have only VB and all the needed stuff.
OK! I'll give it a whirl. Thanks for your suggestion.
Hey sorry for late reply, appreciate the in depth responses. Any more tips of any sort will be greatly appreciated as i am a beginner program hoping to be a software developer later on :)
VB would be lovely for this. Happy to help if you have any questions.
Yep, thanks for your help regardless!
I agree, just wanted to add there is a link in the Resource area to the right to download VS Community.
There's many things that can cause this and unfortunately you will have to read through suggestions and see if your setup applies. I would recommend doing a google search with something like: **VS.Net Breakpoints not breaking execution when Just My Code is enabled**
You need to store the time before ending it. Then when the timer starts again have it add to this value.
This is just the part of my code that I want to change
Post ALL of your code. We’re not here to take guesses or make assumptions.
I dont quite understand you, if you could explain better
done
Okay, so in your update have your timer tick set to 1 ms. On your timer tick event you add +1 to a ms variable for every tick. Remember that there is 1000 ms in a second, so you’ll need to do a little hacking. Have a seconds variable, this will be increased by +1 every time your ms variable is &lt;= 1000. So in your timer tick event do: If ms_val &lt;= 1000 Then ms_val = 0 sec_val +=1 End If Or if you want 100% accuracy you can take your ms_val and divide it by 1000 on every tick instead of resetting it which can possibly create a 1 ms delay. When you divide it by 1000 and the number is a whole number, not a decimal, it means that the ms has reached a span of 1000 ms. To check if it’s a whole number you can either create a string out of the final division and check for a decimal point or use Int.TryParse(division), I believe it will evaluate to false if it’s a decimal which is what you want. Now there are better ways of doing this but this is the easiest that comes to mind. If my code isn’t spot on then I apologize, I’ve recently started C# and my years of VB are slowly falling out of memory. I’ll have to make a practice program today or something to touch up.
I'll have to review your updated code. My answer was based off your original code so I'm not sure if this still applies. 
Sure
What is the maximum number of records that the CSV will ever be?

I replied to you with the code but for some reason the comment isn’t showing. Reddit fucked up.
I have it but its says that 1End is an invalid exponent All Timer's 1 and Toggle Timer require a WithEvents variable
Maybe 40,000 records. But it's very, very possible that it will be more in the future.
Hey Charlie, I got the breakpoint working - the variables are not holding what it's supposed to, but it was indeed holding what I was expecting was causing the code to not run properly. However, I still have no idea why it's doing what it's doing :(
**I'm assuming your bindingsource is to the CSV table. and so It seems to me that you're trying to add rows to a table while you're in a For loop finding them. So yeah, you end up with Duplicates.**

Timer2.Stop() Else If dtInicial = Nothing Then dtInicial = Now.AddMinutes(Convert.ToInt32(txtTempo.Text)) End If Timer2.Enabled = True Timer2.Start() End If End If End If End Sub 
Thank you very much for your kind offer of help! You just may hear from me again.
Vielen Dank! I will have to download and use a free version of the software but I will investigate the link you included. I would be creating this little program for an organization that I am officially joining in about a month. I know they are using Windows but I don't know which version -- I doubt it's any newer than Windows 7 and could even be XP. It is usually best to use the newest versions of software but I have to think about whether Visual Studio Community 2017 would be compatible with the group's operating system. Yes, it would be best in an ideal world if the organization's computers were using an updated Windows system. I won't get into the reasons why this has not happened. Suffice it to say that I may very well have to work with what's available. 
And about the pause and resume button?
did you review it already?
You mean pause and star, there is no resume. They work fine for me. Private Sub B_Pause_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles B_Pause.Click Timer2.Enabled = False 'PictureBox13.SendToBack() 'PictureBox24.BringToFront() End Sub Private Sub B_Reset_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles B_Reset.Click Timer2.Enabled = False Timer2.Stop() lblTempoJunta.Text = "00:00" End Sub Private Sub Timer2_Tick(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Timer2.Tick Calc = dtInicial - Now lblTempoJunta.Text = Format(Convert.ToDateTime(Calc.Duration.ToString), "mm:ss") If lblTempoJunta.Text = "00:00" Then Timer2.Enabled = False Timer2.Stop() End If End Sub
Thanks

 txtTotalRevenue.Text = TotalRevenue.ToString = ("")
That's what I already have in the code.
Thank you. Any suggestions on what would fix it? I've been going through my textbook and looking online but I cant seem to fix it. 
What do you think each part of that piece of code does?
Takes the sum of the values and puts it into the textbox?
But does ALL of that code do that? Or does some of it do something else? Something unnecessary?
In the statement they're talking about: txtTotalRevenue.Text = TotalRevenue.ToString = ("") You're setting the txtTotalRevenue.Text property equal to the result of a Boolean expression. The compiler is interpreting TotalRevenue.ToString = ("") as either true or false. If the TotalRevenue.ToString method returns an empty string, it'll set the txtTotalRevenue.Text equal to true. Your code is setting it equal to false because it seems that you're TotalRevenue.ToString method is returning a non-empty string, which should make sense. Remove the =("") from your last line of code to fix the problem. 
I didn't know that the extra stuff after the To.String would set it equal to true and false. 
Thank you. I changed it to txtTotalRevenue.Text = TotalRevenue.ToString but I'm still getting a false return on the calculations. Should there be anything else to put the numerical value into the string? Am I overthinking it?
I don't see anything else that you should need to change. I copy-pasted your code, removed the extra =(""), and tested it with the values 1,2,3. I received an answer of 66 in the TotalRevenue box like would be expected. did you rebuild the project after changing the statement? 
No I didnt know rebuilding it would fix it. Thats the only way I know how to add it up. After I rebuilt the solution it worked. Thank you so much. 
No problem; glad we could help!
This portion seems to be calculating revenue and not number of seats sold as originally suggested. Why dim each class as a number and then convert each to text? Seems unnecessary. Would probably need more info on the function input array and input, and how it’s spitting out (message box, text file, eg). 
No, it's cool. We can just Replace(string, "'", "''") and call it a day. #HackProof

OnTime isn't a member of the Application object, just as the error says. What are you writing this in? VBA?
I am sorry but what you are doing there is far from how it works, i am afraid no one can help you without the code you have or at least some information like the vb version The basic principle of vb.net does look something like this: Public WithEvents t1 As New Timer Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load 'Initialize und start timer t1.Interval = 10000 '10 sekunden t1.Start() End Sub Private Sub t1_Tick(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles t1.Tick 'code to do whenever the timer runs out End Sub Another thing is "Now" Datetime.Now 'gives you the current time

Don't get defensive man, my final comment was "Your frustrations with others laziness is not healthy, you can not control people, you cant make them do anything. All you can do is help, not helping does not make them better. Supply the help and then tell them how to get it themselves next time. I was a bit more blunt than I usually am because it bothers me as well. I just accept what is and move on." I was trying to indicate your frustrations were getting the best of you. Not give you grief.
I think using Application.Wait would do what you want? This won’t be perfect because I’m on my phone, but something like `for x = 1 to [however many hours you want to repeat this for]` `Application.wait now + timevalue(“01:00:00”)` `’run your module` `next x` 
I am sorry, i somehow missed your comment! I am not sure if you already know but if you worry about the clients the important thing is not the version of visual studio. Thats just the IDE you code in. But the programm you want to write uses a .NET Version, currently 4.7 which you can configure to a lower version if you want and this version determines on which clients you can run your programm. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework#Release_history) has a list which shows you which .NET Framework versions released parallel to which OS Version. As an ELI5 explained the .NET Framework itself is a class library which gives you access to all sort of classes and functions to make your coding easier and the newer it is the more classes it has.

I haven't used VBA in a long time, so note that with what I say next. You may want to loop through ALL the controls, do a check using TYPEOF (if that is available in vba) or at least during that loop check if the NAME of the control is within your limits and then assign that CONTROL (use a FOREACH loop, not a FOR loop) But again, I'm a decade+ from my last use of VBA so...

Glad to help. Have a great day
So... I maybe wrong, but the data table isn't bound to your actual data source. You use your data source to Fill the data table, and any changes you make after that only affect the data table. It's like copying your records into an Excel spreadsheet and adding a new row in Excel. You shouldn't expect adding a new row in Excel would also add it to your data source you copied from. I believe you are missing a step and need to insert the data to the data source.
Tried it, but it still doesn't update the actual database. Still, thanks for the help.
Show us the statement that fails. Are you putting a comma between the columns you want to update? 
I am. I thought it might be that Turns out that, if it IS, the problem can be fixed by forcing it to save My.Settings.Save() I tagged that on to the end of the button and now it works between runs.
&gt; Settings are stored as XML fragments in configuration files. Application-scoped settings are represented by the &lt;application.Settings&gt; element, and generally are placed in app.exe.config, where app is the name of your main executable file. User-scoped settings are represented by the &lt;userSettings&gt; element and are placed in user.config, where user is the user name of the person currently running the application. You must deploy the app.exe.config file with your application; the settings architecture will create the user.config files on demand the first time the application saves settings for that user. You can also define a &lt;userSettings&gt; block within app.exe.config to provide default values for user-scoped settings. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/winforms/advanced/application-settings-overview Look for this file and see if its being updated correctly.
Fair warning, I did say "sometimes". It doesn't always reset the settings so the explicit call to Save may be a red herring.
calling it on the button seems to have worked
Looking over my code, I always save settings immediately whenever the user modifies one. I don't know if that's a good practice or not.

https://pastebin.com/TTMKYBcE This is the block of code i want to execute every hour Any suggestions ? :)
Actually, let me confuse you even more. The language VB.Net has also a version itself, which is currently 14 i think but this is not that important. The main importance for you is the .Net Framework Version, and if you want to be save you could for .NET 2.0 which should run on all older and newer clients. I would also recommend to not go for VBA in Word, this will raise complications down the line if the programm has a longer life cycle. If you have questions you can always hit me up :) 
Well, basically what i already posted but in the timer tick function you call your scheduling click: Private Sub t1_Tick(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles t1.Tick 'code to do whenever the timer runs out Scheduling_Click(Me,System.Eventargs.empty) End Sub On a side note your code is not really good so you may experience some problems. for instance if the timer ticks every ten seconds like in my example &gt;Hour(Now) = 9 will be true a whole hour long, meaning the timer will do this around 360 times. You can solve this for instance by setting the timer tick to one hour but i personally don't like this approach. I would save which task are done for the day and ensure they are only done one time. Another problem in your code are the repetitions, for instance your excel loading. Why dont you put this in a sub? A good rule of thumb is: Every line of code you write twice is wrong, even if it sometimes seems to be quicker to just copy and paste. 
Were you originally trying to call on the `MyForm.Closed()` event? If so, try using `MyForm.FormClosing()` instead. With the Closed() event your form is already dead before it can even try to execute a save command. 
ListBox2.Items.Add(ListBox1.SelectedItem) ListBox1.Remove(ListBox1.SelectedItem) This should do the trick. It hasn't been through VS so my name spacing might be wrong. 
When removing items from list boxes, you always want to go backwards. Start at the END of the list and go to the start. Otherwise you get the kind of behaviour you describe. Also, minor performance enhancement - once you have found and removed the selected item, you can Exit For to get out of the loop. No need to continue looping since you're done.
Thanks for the reply. Good call on the Exit For, but I'm rather new with this all and self-taught so I'm not sure exactly what you mean with going backward. Care to elaborate? 
I actually misread your code. The suggestion by /u/pingemann is better. You don't need a loop if only one item is being moved. You need a loop if the list box supports multiple selection and you want to move all selected items. By moving backward, I mean starting with the last list item and ending with the first. A "for" loop can go from a high number to a low number using the "step" clause: For i = UBound(ListBox1.List) To LBound(ListBox1.List) Step -1 If you don't do this, then when you remove an item from the list, it affects all items after that list. So when you try to reference the next one, what does that mean? For example, if you have a list with 4 items and you remove the 2nd one, then the one that was previously 2nd is now 2nd. It's confusing, and I'm not sure the behaviour is even documented. But if you start with the 4th item and go to the first, then removing the 2nd item doesn't cause any problems. The first item is still the first. 
Ah ok thank you u/Sasken and u/pingemann. It seems to be working now. 
You shouldn't need the loop, Just use ListBox1.RemoveItem (ListBox1.ListIndex)
This also works and is most likely more efficient. My users have pretty low end computers so I'll definitely go with this one. Anything helps Thanks a lot!
You have to be a bit more specific. What I usually do is download a copy of the entire source repository (classes, modules, *.dlls, and especially the *.vbproj and *.sln files). You want to keep everything in the same relative folder structure. Next, open the *.sln file(s) as these will have the load and build order for the *.vbproj files. This may also not compile, but you should see messages as to why. You might need to remove and add back references. You may need to import custom controls. All of this should be mostly contained in the repository. You might also run into some C-sharp files, but Visual Studio should be able to sort it out for you. You can also still read and trace the code to a point to get an idea of how it works. If you get stuck, post the error you’re getting and the repository you are trying to load. Working with other people’s repositories is not always straightforward but is a valuable skill to learn.
There are libraries out there you can use to do this. Or you can create your own parser using regex or string manipulation.
Way over my head. Self taught from YouTube basically, but I’ll look into it. Thanks. 
Store used cards in an array and every time you play a card, check if it already exists in the array. If it does not, then add it. At the end when all cards are used, clear the array.
Thanks a lot man, will take your advice and proceed. Will let you know how it goes, cheers bud :)
Good luck and have fun :)
I'll often re write programs just to make sure they stick in my mind. I am also learning.
Hey, Yoruh, just a quick heads-up: **posession** is actually spelled **possession**. You can remember it by **two s’s in the middle and two at the end**. Have a nice day! ^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
So if I only have the code I have try to understand bc I can't run it right?
You mean all you have are the classes and no project or solution files? In that case, yes. In fact, if they depend on references you don’t have, they are completely useless.
I am not sure exactly what you mean by that, but yes, once you have code it is up to you to figure out how it works. Often code has comments on how a function works, but don't count on that. Learning to write code is a lifelong activity, so don't expect to learn it in a few months.
In the button onclick event in form1: Form2.subName() 
Me; 20+ years of professional software development I often rework, redesign and refactor my functions. Look at it this way, if you don't look at your old code and think it should be improved, then you haven't learned anything. So good for you!
hell yesterday i just scrapped rewrote something I wrote a month ago. 
My thoughts exactly. There is obviously a lot of "if it ain't broke, don't fix it", but if I have to get into something that is broke, I may do a substantial refactoring. As long as it is working, I'm not touching it. 
It depends. Do you unit test? Rewriting code that you KNOW works is a good way to break lots of things. If you have tests written that can validate the methods still produce the correct results with the changes, then it makes sense to refactor code when possible to make it better/cleaner.
That is generally bad coding practice. If 2 different forms need to call the same code, then that code should be put in a common class or module and called from each form.
I am having the same problem. This works for one item, but if I want to move multiple items at a time it only copies the first one. I tried using ListBox2.Items.Add(ListBox1.SelectedItems) but it just adds "(Collection)" to the list box.
&gt; Again she said nope, and that I should be using a while loop. I'm sorry to say that you're teacher is an idiot. 
Technically you don't need a sorting algorithm just to insert one new value. But I don't think she was explaining that well
I can't do it that way. She said I should be using a while loop. I guess I need to take the array, redim it with an extra space, move half of it over to the end and replace a value in the middle??
I think I added your code in wrong or am missing something still. This is what I've got: Private Sub Button2_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button2.Click Dim nums() As Integer = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13} Dim newnum As Integer = TextBox1.Text ReDim Preserve nums(7) Label2.Text = Nothing Dim insertAt As Integer For x = 0 To nums.Length - 1 If nums(x) &lt; newnum Then insertAt = x Exit For End If Next For x = nums.Length - 2 To insertAt Step -1 nums(x + 1) = nums(x) nums(insertAt) = newnum Next For i = 0 To nums.Length - 1 Label2.Text &amp;= nums(i) &amp; ", " Next It just seems to change the first 2 numbers in the array to what number I want to insert. EG: Insert #4 Get: 4, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13
She literally just tells us to do something, then we do it and the people like me and a few others try and find the best way to do it, like a for each w/ array.sort(nums) and then she'll tell us to do it a harder way...
&gt; nums(insertAt) = newnum Only do this once after the loop Beyond that you'll need to step through the code to find my mistake(s). I did this from memory and haven't tested it. It was just to show the general idea.
Just showing that all for loops are really while loops.
Oh okay, will do. So It should not be inside any loop at all then?
Thank you so much! I fixed it, simple &lt; / &gt; mistake lol. Here's my code working: https://pastebin.com/h6kD8TQa
Will do, although oddly found a new issue lol. If you try to insert a number larger than the last number in the array it will just add it to the front... My current half ass solution is to have a 1000 before the loops and then set that to 0 at the end, and after that redim the array to be smaller.
All items in a ListBox gets their .ToString displayed in the list. So have a object in a ListBox that both offers you to have a display property and a content property you can create a class that has two property 1) a DisplayText and 2) an object property that contains your actual object. Then override the .ToString method and have it return the DisplayText property. Now you can create variables of that type and when you put 'em into a ListBox your DisplayText will be used to show the text entry in the ListBox. When you use SelectedItem you will get the entire object with both properties so remember to fetch the property containing your object. If you need more help I'll gladly demo. PM me. 
I had to deal with this a bit in college. I frequently came up with different solutions than everybody else and sometimes this did not go over well with the teacher. In your case since your teacher has given you some specific instructions on some of the steps to be included in your algorithm I suggest you humor her... then do your own algorithm for "bonus points" or just to satisfy your own curiosity for improvement.
thanks. I've done some preliminary exploring and I think I'll need to find another avenue. I downloaded Visual Studio but couldn't use it because I've chosen not to deal with Windows 10 yet. I found the visual basic in Word won't work for me either. I'm taking a pause with the idea and will revisit it in a month or two. Thank you for writing back though!
We needed 3 functions, with each button having a solution to each problem via a function.
RichTextBox I have never used a Dictionary before. I will look into this! Thanks
There's a .Net collection for almost any need. If you find yourself using arrays in complicated ways (or arrays of arrays, or whatever), take a step back and see if there's a collection that will do what you need. I hardly ever use arrays for anything. Generic Lists are so much better. There's probably a minor performance hit, but that's the only downside. And it's insignificant compared to how much simpler the code is.
This would be a one-liner with LINQ/`GroupBy`.
 So far the Dictionary is working great. I'm just having one annoying problem Here is my Code: Private Sub ItemSold_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load Dim Dictionary As New Dictionary(Of String, Integer) Dim ItemsSold() As String = My.Settings.DailyItems.Split("|") Dim value As Integer For Each item As String In ItemsSold If Dictionary.TryGetValue(item, value) Then Dictionary(item) = value + 1 Else Dictionary.Add(item, 1) End If Next For Each item As KeyValuePair(Of String, Integer) In Dictionary RichTextBox1.AppendText(item.Key &amp; " | " &amp; item.Value) Next End Sub I have a My.Setting to handle the string collection (so it would persist through application closes), I make the dictionary. I take the string and split it and then for each item in the string collection I test to see if its in the Dictionary. If it is, then it takes its value and increases it by 1. If its not it adds it to the dictionary with a value of 1. Then for every item in the dictionary it appends a richTextBox with the information in the dictionary. I end up getting something like this: Item A | 1 Item B | 3 Item C | 1 |1 I cant seem to figure out what it causing that trailing " |1 ". I think it has to do with the fact that My.settings.DailyItems = "" at the start of the application. Its always at the end, and I cant seem to find whats causing it to be appended.
. Dailyitems starts out at empty, in another party of the program I have the code My.settings.dailyitems = my.settings.dailtitems &amp; "item 1 (verical bar here, I can't find it on my phone pad)" So it if I keep pressing it it would be something like "item 1 l item 1 l item 1 l .... Oh wow.. There it is. By having the format end with the split character I was insuring that there would always be a final blank entry
Nice! Can you revive vb6 for us in your spare time ? :)
Im not familiar with what LINQ is; So I am looking over the code you posted, and I think I understand it, but there are a few parts im not sure about. Since I dont like to use code I dont understand, perhaps you could help clear it up: Dim myStrings as New List(of String) myStrings.Add("a") myStrings.Add("b") myStrings.Add("b") myStrings.Add("c") myStrings.Add("a") This seems straightforward. Making a list of strings. Dim query = From str in myStrings Group By strVal = str Into aggList = Group, Count() Select StrValue, agglist.Count() This I don't understand. It uses words i've never had dealings with. Its making a collection of things, from My.strings, then..after that I get lost. Dim builder As New StringBuilder() For Each item in query builder.AppendLine(String.Format("{0} | {1}", item.StrValue, item.Count)) Next RichtextBox.Text = builder.ToString() This makes a new String Builder, and for every item in the query group it builds a string? I never used a stringbuilder before but sorta know what they are for
LINQ allows you to write queries against many types of collections, sql, xml, arrays. The syntax looks like SQL. In the block with LINQ, the first line sets up the query from the collection. The second line groups items in the collection by their string value. The third line is part of the group by clause and it creates a new collection with the group value and count of that value. The fourth line returns the values in the new collection. Links: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/introduction-to-linq https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/queries/group-by-clause For StringBuilder, strings in .Net are immutable which means they cannot change value after creating it. So when you use string methods, like concatenating, you are actually creating a new string instead of changing the original one. In this circumstance, you are concatenating strings inside a loop, so each iteration, a new string is created in memory. StringBuilder is a way to create and modify a string without creating a new object every time. In short, it can boost performance. Links: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/stringbuilder 
Heh, sharing the survey from another sub. I don't work for Microsoft. (And while I think people inevitably need to move on from VB6, it'd be nice if Microsoft made it available for download for those who still need it.)
This is going to be a lot to digest, but I think I am understanding it. Its just a few levels beyond what i'm currently at. I think in the long run though it will help me out! Thanks again!
No problem!
Sad, but VB is the last thing they think about when planning the future of .NET
Ah got it. Misread it. Yeah I'm still working on a big legace project and now that I know it well I've come to really like it speed and relative simplicity.
Thank you for your help! I was able to get the text that I wanted to show in the listbox when I click a checkbox. But the issue is if I click it more than once, that same text appears again. So "24k gold watch" "24 gold watch" Is what shows in the listbox. Is there anyway I can have it only do it one time?
Thank you for your help! I was able to fix the error. But I only kept one textbook. But now I am trying to figure out how to make it an an/or statement. As in, If name and/or friends name is not entered in Display Error MessageBox If not Display ThankYou MessageBox Could you help me please?
Let’s think about this logically: If checked, then add pyjamas to the list If unchecked, then add a blank space to the list. See the problem? At no point are you deleting the items from the list. So what you need to do is on the checked=false state, call lstone.Items.Remove() instead of Add()
You need to capture the CommandLineArgs. Any time a file is opened with an associated app the information sent to the app(passed as a command line argument) is the files location. At that point you need to capture the file location and handle what will happen.
Your other option is to create a master subroutine that clears the listbox, then looks at each check box and adds the appropriate text. This could be preferential, if un-checking a checkbox has an effect on another checkbox.
Ya that would be pretty easy. Just loop through all controls of the radio button type and set them to true/false.
you can iterate through your variables with for loops.
Put all the wire values in a collection, then you can use LINQ methods like `Count`, `Any`, `Last`, etc. You may also want to use an [enum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/constants-enums/how-to-declare-enumerations) for your wire colors to make your code more readable. That way, your conditions could look something like Dim wires = {Wire.Blue, Wire.Red, Wire.Yellow, Wire.Yellow} Dim reds = From wire In wires Where wire = Wire.Red Dim yellows = From wire In wires Where wire = Wire.Yellow If reds.Count = 1 AndAlso yellows.Count &gt; 1 Then ' ... ElseIf wires.Last = Wire.Yellow AndAlso reds.Count = 1 Then ' ... End If
Thank you! I ended up creating a string and doing remove when unchecked.
You should do a bit of research. Try; vb.net variables 
what have you tried so far? I'd assume any example for getting a list of processes would at least load them into a list or something.
My research is approaching forums like this one. 
I do have a list that for each running process, i can pull info from it... i would like just to check every few seconds and see if it closed... thats all
Awesome!
No this is your method of getting somebody to do it for you.
And how would you know that? I need pointers to examples, links that experienced people may know, not an executable... if you just want to be negative, fuck off...
And how would you know that? I need pointers to examples, links that experienced people may know, not an executable... if you just want to be negative, fuck off... 
?
Yea, that made no sense. Here is my take on what you want: Dim sValues as String = "" If txtName.Text.Trim().Length &gt; 0 Then sValues = "Please enter name" End If If RadDelivery.Checked = False Then If sValue.Trim().Length &gt; 0 Then sValues = sValues &amp; vbLineFeed End If sValues = sValues &amp; Please Enter Your Address End If If (sValues.Trim().Length &gt; 0 Then MessageBox.Show("Please update these values: " &amp; sValues) End If
Your perception is I am being negative. I gave you your answer in the first post. I was not mad or frustrated with you. I gave you what you wanted a path to finding the knowledge. People whom ask first without checking are just using this space as a crutch, not only is this available easily online. It is also available in the built in help of Visual Studio. Don't try and hang me with your issues.
You have list of pid's in your lvwCustomers object. You can iterate through that list grabbing each PID and you can then compare to the list of PIDS in your current process list. If the old PID is no longer in the list then the process has closed and you can remove it from the list. If you need some help with specific code let me know. 
wifi is a local network? you need to be more specific.
It sounds like the wireless network is not on the same subnet/vlan as the Ethernet network and/or doesn’t allow access to the AD environment. That is, based on the info you provided
yeah it should be a property of the button. What have you tried so far?
You need to use the `buttonName.visible` propertie and set it to true. 
How do I show all my code then
Copy/paste. And you can even format the code if you want to. 
 If i = DoNotWantTo Then What()
you want help with your code but you don't want to share it? Kind of like asking the doctor to diagnose you without you coming to see them isn't it? Telling your mechanic your car makes a funny noise over the phone and then ask them what is wrong with it? Are you worried that people will make fun of your code? I can tell you that there is nothing revolutionary about making mouse macros (and virtually all gaming mice have software that already does this), so it isn't a million dollar idea you are giving away if you post your code.
You do realise that it was not me that commented that...
Sorry, I did not. Was on mobile so I didn't get the OP highlighting.
For Key Press to work correctly the object needs focus. If the object is invisible it can not have focus
I'm just here to confuse and frustrate people. I don't even know why. 
Form1.KeyPreview = True
&gt;ExecuteReader requires an open and available Connection. The connection's current state is closed. The error message spells out the problem pretty clearly, doesn't it?
Generally, I recommend looking at the Microsoft documentation for the class you're working with. Specifically, you want to look at what you're doing with your OleDbConnection. You've given it a connection string (which is setting a property on the connection object), but haven't told it to do anything. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.oledb.oledbconnection(v=vs.110).aspx Look at the Methods category to see what you can tell your OleDbConnection object to do. It should be a pretty simple command you're missing. :)
That's weird I googled that exact search, went to Microsofts website and got a bunch of irrelevant shit. Fuck knows, thanks mate. 
It happens. I use Bing, which :sometimes: does better with Microsoft searches. But as the case is, the top result is generally like the above, a msdn.microsoft.com page... which is actually the old version. The new version of their .NET documentation is at docs.microsoft.com but usually it doesn't matter much because it hasn't changed all that much.
Thanks man 
Here is a place to get started. You have to do a check for each character in the total amount of characters in the number. compare each number against the previous number and if its higher, store the value. Functions that could help solve the issue Length\(\) Mid\(\) For loop Variables Once you have a full solution post it here so we can show others how to do stuff like this, The the pros can come in a post there "fricking weird way" to solve it :\)
you're gonna need to be more specific. like what VB you're using for a start, then what database(?) or whatever this column is in. 
Mod 10
When you load the text file and loop through each line, place each line in an array or list, then the buttons will just get the specific value in that array/list
Thanks that makes sense I don't know why I didn't think of that i'll try to do this when.I get home and.let you know what code I came up
You aren't using a 'New' constructor for your object variables. Dim BaseList as New ListBox Without the New constructor (or assigning an existing object) the variable is just a placeholder, it doesn't represent an actual object in memory.
thank you!
Thank you for the tip, but that didn't work :/ The error still pops up. I should clarify that I'm in Microsoft access, and I already created both the listbox and the check box. Any other ideas?
If you added controls to the form designer and named them baselist and vegancheck, then you should not be declaring variables with the same names within your subroutine. 
Your question is too vague. A login system is not a simple thing as we would need to know some things, such as is this homework, a real application. If it's real, is it web or desktop. You will need to use encryption: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en\-us/dotnet/standard/security/cryptography\-model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/security/cryptography-model) You do not want to EVER, ever ever! have user's passwords stored in plain text. So, you'll also need some data store, such as a database or text file \(don't use text files!\) If this is a real application, then there will likely be rules to password strength \(length, special characters, etc\) So, as you can see, the issues add up quickly. When you want help, being as specific as you can allows us to address the real issues. Your flair shows you as a beginner, so that's fine, this info is not shaming you, only informing you that we need a specification for what you are doing, not just a blanket vague question.
All good points, but not what the person asked. So I assumed this was a homework assignment, not a real world application. (I hope) But if this was real world, then YES your points are very valid.
&gt;ComboBoxes thats actually make sense. thanks. &gt;TextBox with custom Buttons but i am more interested in this one. i got the upper arrow symbol by using "^" from the keyboard. What about the arrow down?
Vee is usually used in text mode, `^v` But rather looks at the charmap for proper unicode arrows?
Why. There's a control called a NumericUpDown that's designed to do this exact task with absolutely no extra work on your part. 
Wow, i feel so dumb. i didn't know that. Thank you
ScrollBar doesnt have a text property
thanks but i found a solution by setting the value to hundred. Take a look of my Edit of the post for more detail
We've all been there. Not sure where you found that idea, but be careful with tutorials written for VB6 (this was a common way to do it back then) as they'll be way outdated.
I am using Visual Studio 2017 and an Access Database. The column is a Long Text called aComment and the Append Only is set to yes.
Do you have a list of items in textbox1 and trying to concat them to textbox2?
Yes! My textbox1 has: example1 example2 and so on.. my textbox2 has: @gmail.com I want the textbox3 to merge all this together so it will be: example1@gmail.com example2@gmail.com and so on...
Wouldn't it be better to have a list box with this info? Have inputtextbox and a inputbutton. Do any validation and then have an list box add to the input list box on button click event. Have the concat text box (in this case @gmail.com) Then you can do a for each loop (or while loop) over the list box and output to the output list box. Keep a counter variable (like x for example) to be able to place the output in the output list box.
Yes it’s ok to have a list box with all the examples and then a text box with @gmail.com Then the text box add the text after every item on listbox
You can use a variabel, you put the text of the to textboxes in a 'string' variable here's an example for your case : 'this wil put your text inside as string Dim Text1 as string = TextBox1.text Dim Text2 as string = "@gmail.com" Dim Text3 as string = Text1 &amp; Text2 
This will do what you want. for each item in listbox1.items item.text += textbox2.text next Each item in a list collection can be iterated. This grabs each row in the listbox and appends the value of textbox2.text to it. 
Try opening the project, before opening the form or code go to the top next to view. Project&gt;properties&gt;then change the target framework to match what is on your school computers. 
You can fix the "AddMotorData' is not declared" error by declaring "AddMotorData".
how would i go declaring that? I'm a complete beginner in this, and I'm following along what my book says.
It looks like AddMotorData is supposed to be another Sub or a Function of some sort. Presumably your book has more advice than just the above.
Can I assume you've looked into https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/winforms/high-dpi-support-in-windows-forms
Where are you learning from? 
That stuff is only available in applications that target .NET 4.7 and higher, and I only use 4.5 right now, and 4.7 isn't available as an option iirc, and I don't know what version we use at work off-hand, but I'll check that today when I go in. Thanks for the info!
You could declare AddMotorData with Dim AddMotorData = (etc.) Like you did with objectformotor
Private Sub ButtonAdd_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles ButtonAdd.Click Dim objectformotor As new MyMotorClass Dim AddMotorData ** getMotorData(objectformotor) AddMotorData(objectformotor) MessageBox.Show(“Motor record added successfully!”) End Sub //This should be your code + AddMotorData with Dim (note that if you have any other classes tell me)
There's a way to do some of it with 4.6, though this article doesn't document it. Some of the high DPI support started in 4.5.x I think, but you're really at the mercy of your .NET Framework version here, since this is something they very recently were working on improving.
Sorry man my bad I forgot that when you iterate a listbox it goes funky if you change it without the index. Try this. For i = 0 To ListBox1.Items.Count - 1 ListBox1.Items(i) += TextBox1.Text Next
What has googling led you to? 
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=rental+system+tutorial+vb.net https://itsourcecode.com/2017/03/car-rental-system-using-vb-net-2/
It has led me here. If google had the answer I wouldn't have posted here right?

I would try BackgroundWorker. It makes multithreaded stuff easy.
Usually that's followed up by some sort of suggestion / answer though. Otherwise it just comes off as dickish to say "Did you google it?" "yep!" "oh tough. Just wanted to make sure you googled it."
A "Long" variable in MS Access can store values between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647. The value you're trying to put in that Long variable is 8,589,934,604 which is too big for that data type. You might need to use a Double instead. https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_datatypes.asp
I tried changing it to double and to decimal and got [this](https://imgur.com/a/L8JX6kY). Could the problem be in the database?

Actually I believe you need to use an Int64, not a double. A double holds a decimal value and I am not sure the largest value for that, but an Int64 should get you what you want
Yeah.. I apologize, it’s vb.net. I have never touched it before so it’s a learning process. 
So we have a series of dates; @date1 - @date5 the easiest way to get the earliest date is to add them to an array sort the array and grab the first one. Depending on how you want to treat your null/empty values if you don't care about empty values then do a check when adding to the array and if its not a date then ignore it. I am not familiar with the [@date.1] format is that something in your application? If understood it I could probably iterate it and cut this code down. Dim datearray As New ArrayList ' will contain date1 - date 5 If IsDate([@date.1]) Then datearray.Add([@date.1]) If IsDate([@date.2]) Then datearray.Add([@date.2]) If IsDate([@date.3]) Then datearray.Add([@date.3]) If IsDate([@date.4]) Then datearray.Add([@date.4]) If IsDate([@date.5]) Then datearray.Add([@date.5]) datearray.Sort() Dim mydate As Date = datearray(0) MsgBox(mydate) You will need to modify this in your code to fit your app. This method has the advantage of checking each of your dates, for null or empty values, can deal with any number of dates, and is a lot easier to understand. 
That would be great. I've been using VB since VB4 and never really moved on from WinForms. The world is heading towards C# although the TIBO list says C# and VB are almost at the same level. I would really like to dive deeper into VB. 
 Public Class FrmAssignTo Dim Total As Int64 = 0 Dim DisposableTotal As Int64 = 0 Private Sub FrmAssignTo_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load Me.TblFormTableAdapter.Fill(Me.IdeaDataSet.TblForm) Dim rows As Integer = Me.IdeaDataSet.TblForm.Count - 1 For a = 0 To rows If Me.IdeaDataSet.TblForm.Rows(a).Item("ID") Like ReviewIdeaID Then If Me.IdeaDataSet.TblForm.Rows(a).Item("TeamNumber") Is System.DBNull.Value Then Else Total = Me.IdeaDataSet.TblForm.Rows(a).Item("TeamNumber") DisposableTotal = Total Else End If Next End Class
&gt; Total = Me.IdeaDataSet.TblForm.Rows(a).Item("TeamNumber") Is that where the error is occurring? If so, do me a favor and try it like this: Total = Convert.ToIn64(Me.IdeaDataSet.TblForm.Rows(a).Item("TeamNumber"))
VB is dying. I still love VB, but content is sparse. Any content you add will be great. It seems like a lot of posts are coursework-related. I really only use VB from a hobbyist perspective these days. I'll try to contribute some content in the vein.
Sounds great!
It didn't work. It appears the problem is in the database, but I don't know how to set or change the data type.
If the database is storing the info, then the issue is not with the database itself. But to be sure, run a query in whatever tool you use against this db. Also, saying "It didn't work" isn't helpful. What specifically didn't work? Did you attempt to check the properties of the Adapter?
Your email address SEEMS wrong; ".com.com" ??
if I'm understanding you correctly, you want to continue to hit the button and have the labels scroll (rotate). An easy way to do this is to set the labels up to be an equal distance apart and then for rotating right, add that distance to the Left property of each label then immediately check to see if the current left position is greater to your max position and if it is, make it your minimum position. The others will follow in their proper position. Also, is the VB6 or VB.Net
Wow. That's his actual email and password.
whoops
I removed the post.
I'd change your password too, as it was up for a while. 
The error says it couldn't resolve it, but I do not understand what that means. And I'm not sure about the local mail server either. I'll ask my supervisor, thanks.
Fixed it, but still the same problem 
So what does TeamNumber represent that it needs to be 8+ billion? Just curious as to whether this could just be a string or will you be performing math equations against it?
I really want to see more work on pushing VB into multiplatform use. My current app is WinForms-dependent at the moment, but it's not a UI-heavy app, and I've considered how useful it'd be if it ran on Linux someday.
Count me in as interested. I've been doing a lot more web work lately, and I'd love to see some VB/.Net Core stuff, since there's pretty much none of it anywhere.
That code doesn’t help, do you have your behind code? In the aspx.vb file?
this is just very simple basic code, its a simple xmldatasource you don't need codebehind for it to function. in a index.aspx page put the following: &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"&gt; &lt;%@ Page Language="VB" %&gt; &lt;html dir="ltr" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt; &lt;head runat="server"&gt; &lt;meta content="text/html; charset=utf-8" http-equiv="Content-Type" /&gt; &lt;title&gt;Untitled 1&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;form id="form1" runat="server"&gt; &lt;asp:XmlDataSource ID="RSS" runat="server" DataFile="url-to-rss-feed-here-http-works-https-does-not" XPath="rss/channel/item[position() &lt;= 4]"&gt;&lt;/asp:XmlDataSource&gt; &lt;div id="postfeed"&gt; &lt;asp:Repeater ID="Feeder" runat="server" DataSourceID="RSS"&gt; &lt;HeaderTemplate&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Heading&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;/HeaderTemplate&gt; &lt;ItemTemplate&gt; &lt;div class="blogpost"&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="&lt;%#XPath("link")%&gt;" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;%#XPath("title")%&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;asp:literal id="xpathdesc" runat="server" /&gt; &lt;%#XPath("pubDate")%&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/ItemTemplate&gt; &lt;FooterTemplate&gt; &lt;/FooterTemplate&gt; &lt;/asp:Repeater&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;
The only one I worked with was gem box document and it can export word directly. Might be worth using instead of a standard editor class. https://www.gemboxsoftware.com/document/examples/word-editor-asp-net/5102 The only other way would be to break the html down and rebuild it ans a DOCX using openXML https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/bb448854.aspx its a bit of a bear, but of you were to build a rule map like &lt;h1&gt; = Header 1 style in word You could gert a half decent document out of it.
Thanks! I'll try the gembox option first. I really don't want to rebuild the whole document in openXML!
This is my code its kind of stupid because i tweaked it i guess this might be helpful TextBox1.AppendText(" &gt; Patching hosts file" &amp; Environment.NewLine) If CheckBox1.Checked = True Then Dim FileToCopy As String Dim NewCopy As String FileToCopy = "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts" NewCopy = "hosts" If dino = "yes" Then Dim result As Integer = MessageBox.Show("Previous backup already exists do you want to replace it ?", "Backup Exists", MessageBoxButtons.YesNo, MessageBoxIcon.Exclamation) If result = DialogResult.No Then ElseIf result = DialogResult.Yes Then My.Computer.FileSystem.RenameFile("hosts", "temp.dat") File.Copy(FileToCopy, NewCopy, True) TextBox1.AppendText(" &gt; Backup Replaced" &amp; Environment.NewLine) End If End If If System.IO.File.Exists(FileToCopy) = True And dino = "no" Then File.Copy(FileToCopy, NewCopy, True) TextBox1.AppendText(" &gt; Backup Generated" &amp; Environment.NewLine) dino = "yes" End If End If TextBox1.AppendText(" &gt; Patching complete" &amp; Environment.NewLine) End Sub
I Will try that on monday and i Will let you know if it worked thanks...
Can I safely assume you are running this elevated/as admin?
I suggest you use MySql or SQL Server Express.
Are you at any point and stuck or do you just not know where to begin? I personally like to execute SQL statements as I feel like I have a lot more control. With that being said you need a connection string to your database. You then need to set that string to your connection object, build an sql statement (called a command) and execute it. INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE are all NonQuery commands which are executed using &lt;command&gt;.ExecuteNonQuery SELECT statements require you to instantiate a Reader object which is a forward only collection of your Query results. It uses &lt;command&gt;.ExecuteReader. There is also &lt;command&gt;.ExecuteScalar for when a single cell of information is returned from your select statement. That being said, here's a quick example using Oledb objects (Access) Dim sstmt As String = "SELECT * FROM ProductPrices ORDER BY ProductID" Using con As New OleDb.OleDbConnection("Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=S:\Applications\CostingDB.mdb") con.Open() Using cmd As New OleDb.OleDbCommand(sstmt, con) Using rdr As OleDb.OleDbDataReader = cmd.ExecuteReader While rdr.Read Dim item As New FinishedGood With {.Name = rdr("ProductID").ToString, .ListID = rdr("PListID").ToString} ListBox1.Items.Add(item) End While con.Close() End Using End Using End Using So we create an sql statement. In this example a Query We then create a new connection and pass in a connection string that will show the path and provider of our database. We use a Using statement here so that all of our instantiated objects are automatically disposed of when they are no longer needed. Next we instantiate an OledbCommand (cmd) and we pass it the query and the connection to use. Since this is a query, we need a DataReader so we are going to set up a reader variable rdr of type OleDbDataReader and fill it by running the .ExecuteReader method on the command object. I use a While loop to iterate through the result of the query In my example I have created my own object called FinishedGood and I am filling it with the ProductID and PListID from my query result. I then add that "item" to my listbox until there are no more rows left in the query result. 
Comprehensive for databases is a LOT. Seriously, people spend their entire careers managing databases, let alone all the code work. Because of this I generally tell people to build something they want/need in order to learn about a product. A project will help drive you to learning, as opposed to learning for the sake of knowledge. \(or at least this works for me\) I also agree with those here who mentioned SQL Server Express or other full featured SQL databases. They are such a main part of business application development that learning some of the basics of databases; modeling, stored procedures, triggers, etc. will be important to know. Once you create a spec for what you want, then you can have more specific questions to ask and we'll be better able to help.
I have been a developer for 20+ years, and started back in 1990 building databases. But to get to know them I needed a task, it allowed me to connect the concept with the reality of it's use. Otherwise it was just academic, which I was never good at. But that's me. That's why I mentioned that **I** work well this way, so OP could connect, or not, to my statement. Have a great weekend
Your natural profession would be to VB .NET and sql server. Learn SSRS in this package as well. 
Put a MYSQL instance on a Raspberry PI and you don't even have to gunk up your development machine.
Are you seeing an error message of any kind?
I can apply the hosts file from external sources but I don't have an idea about taking backup
Can you make a copy of it, without renaming the original file (which would, effectively, temporarily remove it, which Windows probably dislikes)?
Yes I guess I'll try that out but what if the user wants to take backup multiple times when the external sources get updated ?
I recommend you learn C# instead of VB.Net. Most .Net tutorials and documentation are for C# so you'll need to learn it eventually. Also I can see the similar syntax between vb.net and vb6 might cause some confusion. 
Hi this is what my question is How to do Cursor.Position = New Point\(250, 250\) within a function so I can call SetAngle\(250, 250\) instead
By using `Cursor.Position = New Point(x, y)`.
But I want to use SetAngle\(x, y\), do you know how to implement that?
By declaring a `SetAngle` method and putting that code inside it? I really have no clue what your actual question/struggle is.
I just thought about what you wrote and came up with this Private Sub SetAngle\(\) Cursor.Position = New Point\(Cursor.Position.X, Cursor.Position.Y\) End Sub and a button to do SetAngle\(200, 200\) but this obviously does not work, but what do I name it as instead of sub? Function? 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/procedure-parameters-and-arguments
good information
Thank you! I’ll take a look at it in more depth.
Nope, no container at all. Wouldn't the container come up in me.controls anyway? For some reason it's still not finding anything.
Hahahaha I'm unbelievably stupid. I'd put it into the wrong subroutine so it wasn't even performing the code... 
https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/ &gt; I know Visual basic wasn't made for non-Microsoft products get that right out of your head. VB was made for programming. you can make it work with anything that has a library or API or decipherable data format.

There is an extra .com as the above user mentioned also if your using Gmail you have to enable 'let less secure apps access your account' hope this helps 
Besides the issues already pointed out: It looks like you have an issue reaching the smtp.gmail.com server from your network. What do you mean by "I really need to use it with outlook". If you mean you need to use a local copy of Outlook to send the email, then you're wasting your time messing with SMTP, as you'll need to use interop with Outlook to create and send the email with Outlook. 
My guess is he needs to use it with the outlook mail server rather than the gmail mail server.
Stupid MS and their and incessant renaming of products (and confusing duplicate naming)! I always forget that they renamed Hotmail to Outlook, so yea, that's a possibility.
Step for step guide: Step 1: Read the Wordpress API documentation
Can you show an example of what you've tried for outlook? Also, are we talking about the web based outlook client or the client that is part of Office? It is my understanding that the from address must be the same address used in the credentials. So in other words, if you had 2 hotmail accounts (me@hotmail.com and you@hotmail.com) and you used me@hotmail.com with the password to send the mail, I'm of the understanding that you could not use you@hotmail.com for the .From setting because it's not the account sending. I guess this is to minimize spam coming from all sorts of email addresses making it hard to define blocking rules. With that being said you should be able to: Dim SmtpServer As New SmtpClient() Dim mail As New MailMessage() Try SmtpServer.Host = "smtp.live.com" 'Outlook web client (ie, Live, Hotmail) SmtpServer.UseDefaultCredentials = False SmtpServer.Credentials = New Net.NetworkCredential("me@hotmail.com", "mySup3rs3creTP@$$w0rD") SmtpServer.Port = 587 SmtpServer.EnableSsl = True mail.From = New MailAddress("me@hotmail.com") 'This must be what you used in your credentials mail.To.Add("yourValidAddr@somedomain.com") mail.Subject = "Requested Time Off" mail.Body = "The information you're wanting to send" SmtpServer.Send(mail) Catch ex As Exception MessageBox.Show(ex.Message) Finally mail.Dispose() SmtpServer.Dispose() End Try
As much as this is a subreddit to discuss and ask questions about Visual Basic... by reading your post I’m not sure how it’s relatable to your Wordpress problem.. Might I suggest visiting /r/wordpress or /r/webdev to help you with your problem?. 
You were so kind to offer help I wanted to let you know how I solved the "problem". I ended up using Small Basic and created exactly what I wanted. I had to work a little bit to understand which commands to use but that was a good intellectual exercise. I studied examples and learned from them and created something that amazed people who may use it.
Not the answer you are looking for, but.... Consider using stored procedures to send the data you want back to the database. I have been a db developer for 25\+ years and I don't use Data Adapters, so my pov and extended history could be the "wrong" pattern. I have long used stored procedures to insure that: 1. There are distinct layers in the application 2. This allows a level of security for the application as access to the abilities of the db is restricted to stored procedures only. 
Stored procedures have great benefits, but learning them can take you some time. Just be aware
I actually transferred in a bunch of credits and am taking courses out of order, so luckily I took databases last semester. Stored procedures don’t scare me so long a google can help me figure out how to run them.
I actually transferred in a bunch of credits and am taking courses out of order, so luckily I took databases last semester. Stored procedures don’t scare me so as long as google can help me figure out how to run them I’ll be fine.
One HUGE benefit, from a development side, is the separation of the layers. One place I worked had the SQL in the code, and the issue was a simple ORDER BY statement. I could have fixed, tested and moved the solution to production in under an hour if it had been a stored procedure, but since it was in the code MONTHS went by while other issued delayed the release. 
Thank you for your help. I was able to get past this part. However I keep running into [this](https://gyazo.com/35044c0e816a3540c36eb98a050a0674) error I think it has something to do with the stateValue variable. It also says statevalues.StateName is nothing. Not sure why I'm running into this problem, any suggestions?

First off; please post your code, not a screen shot. Your arrayof "States" object looks like it doesn't have any values, again, can't see ALL the code, so I can't tell. I do not see any link between the string arrays and the array of States. So your getAbreviation code is having an issue with a blank value 
Also, your plurar names are off. Your Structure should be STATE \(singular\) and your array should be state\*\*S\*\* It'll make it easier to read and follow eg: \(in getAbriviated\) `For Each State in States`
My bad, first time posting here. Here's all of my code: 'The Program reads the names and abbreviations of states from an array.

Oops, changing now. Good catch
All I can tell from that screenshot /error message / green line under statement is that you aren't setting the state name property to anything. That's the culprit of this error for what it's worth. On my phone or I could help more. Make sure you are actually setting everything you think you are. 
Minor thing, but these types of things can really screw with your mind
 When I mouse over txtState.Text = stateValue.StateName It says "variable StateName is being used before it has been assigned a value" which is definitely the culprit here like you said. That being said I don't know how to fix it
Yes, that's because THAT line in the ELSE shows that the variable "stateValue" has never been set. It's set in the first IF statement, so that variable in that ELSE statement is never assigned. 
Alright thank you man, I'll give it my best shot. I appreciate your help
 This is the revised version of the code based on your recommendations. I'm not sure how to do the case sensitive fix but I did the others and am still getting an error in the lines If stateValues.Abbreviation.Equals(name) Then It says that stateValue.Abbreviation's value is nothing.

a database? not sure quite what you're asking.
I am not allowed to use database for this project. I don't know if an array would be the best option or what. The data does not have to be permanently saved as it is just a mock program.
This is essentially what the createCustomer form looks like: https://gyazo.com/56575efa8ceb577cc4006f738170c303

There are plenty of examples on the web. If you look up custom class vb.net that should help. same thing with lists, lots of code examples on the net.
this is why it's hard to advise on assignments. we don't know what you have an haven't been introduced and are highly likely to recommend something that's not been taught yet. arrays are a big subject, you'll probably be using one in some form.
Yeah I agree, I figured I would just ask because I am a little stuck. Recalling now, lists/arrays were the main thing we were supposed to use.
&gt; It says that stateValue.Abbreviation's value is nothing. Not sure why. What did you use for your input (exactly) because as I said it's case sensitive and indiana will not find Indiana, or ks will not find KS. To fix this, look at your lines: If stateValues.Abbreviation.Equals(name) Then If stateValues.StateName.Equals(name) Then There is an overloaded method for Equals that takes a second parameter for String Comparisons you can use this to ignore case when comparing. so the code would then look like: If stateValues.Abbreviation.Equals(name, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) Then If stateValues.StateName.Equals(name, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) Then 
then I guess for optimum datatypes you'd make an array for each field and make sure each record uses the same array index in all the arrays, even if you have to put a blank value in one. arrays of classes is much nicer, but I suspect that's beyond what you're supposed to use too and will get to it soon.
You don't even need concatenate. `=x&amp;" "&amp;x`
What does the code look like to get the days from the database because you are probably sticking the value into an integer datatype instead of a decimal or double type.
You look close, but this: Dim SQLComand0 As New SqlCommand("Update LEVEL_INSTANCE SET UNLOCKED = 'TRUE' Where ID = " &amp; intLevelNum, SQLconnect) Is not how you create a stored procedure. The stored procedure should take in the parameters, which you have added, take a looked at [this example](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/stored-procedures/create-a-stored-procedure?view=sql-server-2017) and about half way down there is a stored procedure you can see how to use. You only need one SQLCommand, not the two. So SQLCommand0 should be deleted. I am hoping that "UpdateHighScores" has the parameters, if so that should work for you
Yeah but it works, so I'm not really worried about it being a stored procedure vs just a command (query?). My issue is that the changes aren't going to the database proper, just to some temporary version of the database which gets thrown out, eventually. I run the code, it all executes, the changes appear in the data within the program. But then if I close the program, and query the tables, none of the changes apply, at all. But then I restart the program, and the changes are still evident. It's bizarre. If you wanna see the stored procedure that's being called here it is but it's really not the issue. CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[UpdateHighScores] @SCORE Integer, @LvlID Integer, @PlayerName Varchar(20) AS IF 10 &lt;= (SELECT Count(ScoreID) FROM HIGH_SCORES WHERE LevelID = @LvlID) IF @Score &gt; (SELECT MIN(SCORE) FROM HIGH_SCORES WHERE LevelID = @LvlID) UPDATE HIGH_SCORES SET SCORE = @SCORE, PlayerName = @PlayerName WHERE ScoreID = (SELECT MIN(SCOREID) FROM HIGH_SCORES WHERE SCORE IN (SELECT MIN(SCORE) AS T1 FROM HIGH_SCORES WHERE LEVELID = @LVLID)) ELSE RETURN ELSE INSERT INTO HIGH_SCORES(LevelID, PlayerName, Score) VALUES(@LvlID,@PlayerName,@Score); RETURN It's not pretty but it does what I need. Idk, sorry if I sound rude I'm just frustrated.
I appreciate it man.
Creating a number field in a new table via table design defaults number to 0 decimal places. You have to manually make the change in table design view or use a make table query. Also, why have a table named ‘form’? That’s like having a query named ‘table’. Seems non-descriptive and could be confusing when using it as a source or sharing the vb with someone not familiar to the db. 
re: frustrated. Yea, welcome to the world of software development. Sometimes things just don't work. \(arg!\) I have been a developer for 20\+ years, \[source\]\([http://www.blissgig.com](http://www.blissgig.com)\), so yea sometimes it's frustrating. Sometimes it will be your fault, sometimes the computer/components. Sorry. Anyway, It seems your code is fine, but to be sure let's change the stored procedure a little bit CREATE PROCEDURE \[dbo\].\[UpdateHighScores\] @SCORE Integer, @LvlID Integer, @PlayerName Varchar\(20\) AS BEGIN INSERT INTO HIGH\_SCORES \(LevelID, PlayerName, Score\) VALUES \(@LvlID, @PlayerName, @Score\); END This way we can insure that data is being written to the database. \(aside: consider a date/time field in your High\_Scores table, you're likely to want to know when this happened\) So, let's do the following test * Update the proc * Run the application and the code that will update the score. Do \*\*NOT\*\* shut down the app. * I assume you are running SQL Server Manager, or some such tool. Query the database to see if your new values are there. * Shut down the application * Run the query again. * Start the app, does the data appear? If you are finding that data is appearing in the app after shutdown and restart, then it FEELS that your SQL Manager tool might not be looking at the same db. Check your conenction string. Take a peek at this site for the connection best for you: [https://www.connectionstrings.com/](https://www.connectionstrings.com/) Oh, and good morning
&gt;Also, why have a table named ‘form’? That’s like having a query named ‘table’. Seems non\-descriptive and could be confusing when using it as a source or sharing the vb with someone not familiar to the db. Not to pile on to OP, but your statement is very important. Learning naming conventions and patterns will really help.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuwIyTBp9-Q&amp;t=49s I figured I should go ahead and link one of the tutorials I'm referencing. That might make more sense of what I'm trying to do.
Glad you got it working.
I am pretty sure the debugger exits the moment you restart the application during debugging. If you want to reattach the debugger use Attach To Process from the Debug-menu. You can also write macro that essentially do the same as attaching manually. This is useful when debugging windows Services and IIS-sites. 
I saw a program written in visual c\+\+ called fishbot \([www.fishbot.net](https://www.fishbot.net)\). One of the things it does is monitors the selected audio adapter for a certain level of output. The project is open source, so you can go over there and have a look at what they are doing.
Enable KeyPreview on the form then handle the keypress event for the form itself.
Im sure this will take some tweaking on your end, and this is using WinForms where as I believe there is a Microsoft.ReportViewer.WebForms reference as well, but since you are just rendering behind the scenes and not displaying the report on screen it probably doesn't matter which one you reference. Anyway, here is a stripped down example I have used to do this. Public Sub GenerateReport() 'REPORT OBJECT Dim myReport As Microsoft.Reporting.WinForms.LocalReport = Nothing 'REPORT PARAMS COLLECTION Dim myReportParams As List(Of ReportParameter) = Nothing Try 'CREATE NEW INSTANCE OF REPORT myReport = New Microsoft.Reporting.WinForms.LocalReport 'LOAD REPORT FROM EMBEDDED RESOURCE FROM ASSEMBLY myReport.LoadReportDefinition(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly.GetManifestResourceStream("ProjectNamespace.ReportName.rdlc")) 'CREATE INSTANCE FOR REPORT PARAMS myReportParams = New List(Of ReportParameter) 'CREATE A DATA SOURCE (IF NEEDED) Dim myDataSource As New ReportDataSource("DataSetName", DataForDataSetHere) myReport.DataSources.Add(myDataSource) 'SET PARAMS myReportParams.Add(New ReportParameter("ID", "12345")) myReport.SetParameters(myReportParams.ToList) 'RENDER REPORT TO FILE SYSTEM AS PDF My.Computer.FileSystem.WriteAllBytes("output file location here", myReport.Render("pdf"), False) Catch ex As Exception 'ERROR OCCURED Finally 'DISPOSE REPORT OBJECT AND ANYTHING ELSE If myReport IsNot Nothing Then myReport.Dispose() End Try End Sub

Thank you! I'm going to give this a go today. What a fast response!
I haven't used Access for 20 years, I use SQL databases, which technically Access is. \(in full scale SQL databases we use Stored Procedures. In your case \[this example\]\([https://www.codeproject.com/Questions/725824/Inserting\-Data\-from\-VB\-net\-to\-MS\-Access](https://www.codeproject.com/Questions/725824/Inserting-Data-from-VB-net-to-MS-Access)\) should work out for you
And [Update](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ado/reference/ado-api/update-method?view=sql-server-2017) too I believe after `AddNew`
He/she is using ADO.Net - completely different than ADO. /u/EpicShaggy - your DataAdapter object is your bridge between your actual DB table and your application's table. Look at Data Adapter Update: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.common.dataadapter.update%28v=vs.110%29.aspx 
Completely? How so? (In VB it seems, similar.)
Consider splitting each group of parameters into structures or classes of their own, and then overloading your constructor so that it can accept different configurations of grouped parameters. 
so like, instead of CRMType and CRMId, make a structure with two properties and then accept the CRMStruct? And like AppName and AppGroup, have the AppStruct just contain the things related to the Application? Just kind of reduce two or three parameter "groups" into one input parameter for the canned message constructor?
Yeap! It's hard to elaborate without knowing exactly what parameters you're feeding into your constructor, but that's the general idea. This way, even though you're still giving your constructor all the parameters you need, you're not writing a ridiculously long one-line New command. Alternatively, if it makes more sense, make some properties in your class public and allow other classes to directly modify them.
Sure. First things first: you need to include the interop library reference in your vb project. [This link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/313193/how-to-automate-microsoft-word-by-using-visual-basic-to-create-a-new-d) has instructions for that (as well as example code). Once that is done, wherever you want the automation to take place in your code, you’ll need to be sure to include “imports Microsoft.office.interop” at the top of your file. You’ll need to create an object that references the Word Application itself (oWord in [this example](https://www.codeproject.com/Questions/441986/Automating-a-word-template-with-Visual-Basic) ). You’ll then need to add a document to that word application (oDoc in the above example). Then you can access the bookmarks with oDoc.Bookmarks(“BookmarkName”) and change the text with oDoc.Bookmarks(“BookmarkName”).Range.Text. You can save everything once you’re done changing your bookmarks by calling oDoc.SaveAs(filename). When you’re finished you’ll want to make sure that you dispose of the Word objects. I think I did this by making sure I was done with them, then calling Word.Quit(), and setting oWord=nothing. 
Thanks for the advice. I'll give the stop watch idea a try!
I think it might be easier to refactor the entire code so that, instead of shuffling text around, you're actually moving the various buttons to the empty slot. Store the buttons in a 2D array, and whenever a button is clicked, if there are no adjacent empty spaces, ignore it. Otherwise, if there is an adjacent empty space (indicated by there being nothing in the 2D array), move the button to the empty space, remove the button from the previous position, and then update the display to show the new configuration.
Oh you know what? I'm a big dummy... I didn't even look at this line: If ExtensionGet("Operating-System").Length &lt;&gt; 1 Then Return String.Empty End If Okay, I commented that part out, but now I need to figure out how to actually return the Operating-System field. This part is not working: Return DirectCast(ExtensionGet("Operating-System")(0), String) It throws a "System.IndexOutOfRangeException" with message "Index was outside the bounds of the array"
SOLVED Sorry if I wasted anybody's time. I finally solved it by, on a whim, thinking, "maybe MS doesn't like the hyphen". I tried this: Return DirectCast(ExtensionGet("OperatingSystem")(0), String) aaaand it works! Now what makes me really mad, is that Microsoft's official list of server attributes *clearly has a hyphen* for "operating-system". https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms680987(v=vs.85).aspx Everyone in the building heard me cursing Microsoft's name this morning. :)
python is a good first choice. It's not complicated and there are lots of examples. You can use it on lots of microrprocessors too.
If you want to learn programming it’s a very easy language to learn- very easy to follow and very easy to understand. Then- if you enjoy it you can expand to something more modern and more useful. 
VB6 and VBA are very different
Pretty sure Google's not down those sorts of programs. There are some Google APIs you might be able to leverage but I suggest doing a bit of research before going forward. https://moz.com/community/q/which-google-api-do-you-use-to-creat-a-rank-checking-tool
Place 4 spaces in front of each line of code, and that will format it into a code box. like this 
Upvoted b/c I also want to know 
Can you post more code? Maybe the problem lies outside of that If Then statement.
Learn Visual Basic .NET over VB6 any day. Whereas VB6 requires an IDE that's no longer available for free, modern Visual Studio is available for free. VB6 is dead/abandoned, and requires a runtime is installed to support it's basic controls, whereas .NET is included in every Windows version out of the box, and is constantly improving.
You can also put it on http://pastebin.com and post the link here, either is fine.
thank you! the post has been updated with the code :)
Where are you running that if then code?
Thanks a lot! This is working great! I got everything how I wanted and it is saving to the path I want to. I'm only missing how to save it as a PDF. I'm searching how to do it. If you happen to know it would be of great help.
Edit: Now I just need it to close without asking to save it. I don't want to save it as I just want the PDF file. Thanks for all the help :)
Ok this is a VB forum why would you ask a C++ question here?
If you put as much effort into your homework as you do to your posts, you're probably going to fail. Where are you stuck?
Language? Psudocode? What have you done so far? 
Sorry I couldn’t get back to you sooner, but I’m glad you got everything working! I’ve never run into the RPC error, but I found [this link](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/f4978378-67e0-43bc-906d-ee3d930d638f/rpc-server-problem-when-user-closes-word?forum=worddev) that might help. In summary: it sounds like you’re closing the Word app, but some other part of your program is still trying to access it. To fix it, I think you’d either need to close the Word app later, after you’re completely done with it, or create a new instance of the word application before the next part of your program that is trying to use it asks for it. 
Pages? You mean forms? You just do `FormName.ButtonName.BackColor = &amp;HFFFFFF` for white, for example
Thank you so much! I am done with this part of my application :)
Cant you use Application.Exit?
You want the application.applicationexit event. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.application.applicationexit.aspx
If that's all you're looking to do, Excel can pull data using SQL directly.
At my office we solved this problem by making a simple project we called SQL Buddy. Basically it asks for the basic parameters (Start date, end date, record #, etc.) and then runs the query. The results are displayed in a DataGridView control. We access sql using LINQ. Look up LINQ and DataGridView and you should be about 90% there.
Sounds good, ill be able to pick this up tomorrow morning so ill deffo have a look into that. Thanks for your help.
We are not going to do it for you. 
Use .ToLower (or .ToUpper, whatever you prefer) on both strings. This has some minor performance impacts but it's the easiest option. It might not work for all cultures either. If that's an issue, there are ways to compare using invariant cultures, but that's overkill in most cases.
Off the top of my head: myString.Equals(otehrString, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)
It's better to use the built-in equality and comparison methods so you don't have to allocate memory. 
Why not start with one of the items, work through what you know and what you need to know. This is a process you're going to need to have so why not learn it now? And yes, lots of teachers suck \(sorry\) Start by creating a detailed specification of what the application needs to do. The spec should have a step by step process of what the user should do AND what the developer needs to do to accomplish this task. Taking it all in smaller chunks will make it easier. I started with VB 2.0 and have had to learn lots of technologies over the years and it can still feel overwhelming at moments, so give yourself a break. \(currently learning VR, and WOW is there a lot to learn\)
This is solid advice, work up a spec/user story and start from there. 
pc-dmis basic is not VB, so that is very relevant. I don't see anything glaring your logic, if it were VB, so it very well could be a bug in their interpreter. you should contact their support.
I would love to but I word 2nd shift and they refuse to answer me by the time I have access to the PC. 
..and to add to what I said earlier, once you have that we can and will help. But we can't do the work for you, even if you pay us. It's bedtime for me, but I expect ;\) progress by morning
You may get a better response asking at https://www.pcdmisforum.com/ Other than being VBScript like in syntax this language isn't really going to be in our domain.

What code do you currently have?
I an not at my computer right now but I think I built something similar in one it my addons. PM me tomorrow (cause I have a terrible memory and may forget) and I'll send you the code.
itextsharp is going to be the library you will want to use for interfacing with PDF documents. Lots of examples on the web too. https://sourceforge.net/projects/itextsharp/
Use the [drawpolygon](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd0c4s09(v=vs.110).aspx) method. Set up the points in an array. Then use for loops to draw the rows of hexes. Each piece would have an array index for its location on the board. So if there's 8 hexes across, and 8 down, you just need to figure out the math from moving from one hex to another. To go left or right is easy. Just add or subtract one from the position index. If it's at position 30, and it goes left, then it's at position 29. To go NW, well you just subtract width from the position index (8 for example) for NW. so if you're at position 30, you move to position 22. NE would be (width - 1) (or 7) Which would bring you to tile 23. Do the same for SW and SE, except add instead of subtracting. I'll leave edge cases to your own mathematical genius. 
Thank you very much!
That is awesome - BTW If you have a solution you have a very saleable product. It is the single biggest missing piece of VSTO and stops most people from upgrading from VBA to VB. You would think being able to select a range from within a form would be vital for VSTO, yet Microsoft dont even offer a workaround or to add it to VSTO. I will PM you now Thanks again
Seconded. Itextsharp is exactly what I use for all my PDF needs. 
What I would do is at the start sub, start the first question. show the question data in a textbox or whatever, and put the cursor on the answer box. Add a submit button When the user presses the submit button process the answer, and then ask the next question \(i'd just use some integer counters to do this\). All this work can be done in the button pressed event. After the last question has been asked, then print out the right answers or whatever final processing needs to be done and you are finished.
I see what you mean, but it only lets me select one under properties, if i highlight all it doesn't do anything
If you add all the statements in one button it will just jump straight to the last one and ignore the 2nd question. I'm not sure how that would work, perhaps checking whats in the lblQuestion then acting based on that 
I just tested it with two and it worked, im not sure what problem you're having.
 Private Sub PictureBox13_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles PictureBox9.Click, PictureBox8.Click, PictureBox7.Click, PictureBox6.Click, PictureBox5.Click, PictureBox4.Click, PictureBox3.Click, PictureBox2.Click, PictureBox13.Click, PictureBox12.Click, PictureBox11.Click, PictureBox10.Click, PictureBox1.Click End Sub
The way to do it is to have a counter that keeps track of the question number when the user pushes the button, the sub that is triggered by that bottom push does the following: checks answer to see if correct, if correct adds 1 to the total correct increments the question_counter Displays the current_question (which will be the new one) if there is a next question if there is a current question then it waits for a keypress and if there is no current question (i.e. the last question was asked) then show the results or whatever. This way of doing it, you use the array and it doesn't matter how many questions you have. 
yes it does, is this sort of what you meant? is there a way to pause between loops and wait for the button press? i dont know all the syntax yet any more advice is appreciated :) For x = 1 To 2 lblQuestion.Text = Quiz(x, 0) If txtAnswer.Text = Quiz(x, 1) Then score = score + 1 End If Next
no, no programmatic looping at all. the loop happens each time the button is pushed, you have to have a counter (for the question) that is at program initialization. Each time the person hits the submit button, you first check to see if the answer is right, then increase the counter keeping track of which question is the current question, then fill the text box with the current question (which will be the new question because you just increased the counter). The way you pause is that the program waits until you hit submit. Then it processes the data and starts the next question.

Am having extreme difficulty in creating a grid/tiles over this gameboard to be accessible in my previously posted game, any advice would be much appreciated as i'm having extreme difficulty all comments are much appreciated
The image control should allow transparency ala GIF and PNG, create own with an index of 0, and several hidden images with the various tile styles. When you add a tile you can use something like 'new image1(2)' then move the new index control where needed. This would make it easier to check for clicks and such Another route is use picturebox to store all tiles and a mask image then BitBlt the tiles into the grid with autoredraw enabled but you'll need to do maths to figure out what was clicked 
Could this also be accomplished with a for loop?
Don’t need to. Can all be done using the interface 
Thanks :) Yeah depends is probably the best answer to most of IT questions. And thanks for letting me recall Integration Services. I have heard of it but never used it, maybe i will give it a try. 
Thats nice to hear! And i am happy that it did work out for you, but be careful programming can be addictive ;) I never tried Small Basic but i only heared good stuff about it. I should recommend it more often
I don't have my code with me, but I believe OledbCommand works differently than SqlCommand when it comes to parameters. instead of a parameter names @param1, you would just replace it with a ?. [Check out this little article.](https://www.codeproject.com/Tips/231217/Parameters-SqlCommand-vs-OledbCommand-and-OdbcComm)
Try wrapping Password, it's a reserved word in Oledb. However, I'm pretty sure that usually throws a Syntax Error. Anyway, try .CommandText = "Select * From Tbl_Staff Where (Username = @sUsername) and ([Password] = @sPassword)"
Well if you created a sprite that has the player character on the tile and then replace the picture in the picture box when the payer moves to the tile.
Any code to look at? No one is going to be able to help based on the few sentences that you've posted.
Solved! I found the problem, I've been going crazy programming this all day til the point i thought the time it took for me to activate the timer was it being inaccurate when it wasn't!
docker on windows server sure, docker using a Linux container, never going to happen. It would be better to use a virtual machine and run win xp.
Have you researched how much the going price is for similar software? I'd compare the features each suite offers, and gauge your price point on that.
Something like this. I've seen multiple options with software sales in the medical industry. Setup, install, configure, train for 1k \+ a certain amount for support which you could agree on a monthly amount for support or a fixed amount for a support contract. Software only, no support contract = 500. Find a customer, demo the software to them with an amount in mind, keeping in mind the going rate for your competitors, and see what they will pay. In the medical industry the large players usually have a couple of customers they have agreements with to test out the latest/greatest versions of their software/hardware. 
Which brings to mind, you may want to see who they are buying the hardware from and approach them about packaging your software in with their hardware.
No i have not tried it, but it is supported. The engine is included in 2016 containers that are windows based. You will still need to install the OCX's and register them via regserv32. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-basic-6/visual-basic-6-support-policy 
 If cboMagnitude.selecteditem = 1 then Do something Else if cboMaginitude.selecteditem= 2 then do something .... ect Can also use select case 
What you'll want to do is: Current.Set(NewCoord) Where current is an instance of your class, set is a public method, and NewCoord is of type coord. Alternatively, make Coord a Public WriteOnly property so that you can immediately do this: Current.Coordinate = NewCoord 
[This](https://old.reddit.com/r/visualbasic/comments/8nfffw/how_to_connect_combobox_with_commandbutton/dzv8ar5/) + VB.Net should handle the drop down logic for you. 
↳ + VB.Net should handle the drop down logic for you. 
how did you include the DB file when deploying/installing?
The directory it gives you is the directory that the program gets installed when you use the default “Setup” installer that visual studio creates when you click “publish”. Without seeing what you’re doing code-wise, I’m guessing the connection string that your program uses to connect to your database says that the database is stored in “|DataDirectory|databasename” and this would point to the directory you see there. The problem then is that your database wasn’t moved to that location during the install, so the program can’t find it there. I would look up something like how to use the default installer to get your database into the location. 
Will do, thanks. I think I should also mention that I intend to use this program in multiple computers with multiple users and I want the information they each write to the database to be written in the same one so that every user can see what others have done.
then you need to configure your DB connection to point to a UNC path on a shared drive.
Could you please tell me how I can do this?
I'd have to google it a lot. I avoid access as much as possible, which I've been 100% successful at for at least 5 years. if you have a server, I highly recommend using MS SQL Express instead. I think there's even an upsize tool to import your current access data into mssql.
I would suggest installing the setup type in visual studio. I mean click once to a folder I guess is still an option if needs.
Ah! Got it working :\) Thanks for the help mate, really appreciate it!
This is way easier to implement using a template that has the table pre-defined. Is there a reason for not wanting to use a template?
One thought for you - Timer objects will fire more slowly when the CPU is under heavy load. You'll still get an event for each "tick" of the timer, but it may be delayed. So if timing is mission critical you may want to test the DateDiff between the actual time the event fires and the last time measured.
Another option is to write a temporary batch file and execute that.
Right now I have something similar where the user uses the file picker to load the template, but I'd prefer to have it done automatically. I could put the template on the share drive, but not everyone has access to the same locations or sometimes don't have access if they're working remotely. 
Nice little article. I'm also a huge fan of VB for the readability factor. I've been hearing about this lack of VB support on and off for a while but I admittedly don't know the big differences. I went to the Microsoft Ignite conference last year and got to speak with some MS reps. When I brought this up they claimed that VB wasn't going anywhere anytime soon. Of course, I wouldn't expect them to say otherwise. Can you point me towards an article that lists some of the biggest gaps between VB and C#? Thanks for all you do.
I wrote an article over on medium regarding net core and VB. I am frustrated and want MS to stand up and support us better. What can we do to get them to make VB a priority?
This is more about new technologies like ASP.NET core not supporting VB fully. They have no documentation for the parts that exist. No support for Razor pages. The gap has been growing over the last few years, I don't think we as VB developers should be treated as an afterthought. The gap between C# and VB is pretty good for VS 2017 WebForms, MVC and ASP 4X. It is just newer tech that has been ignored.
Hard to tell at first glance, given how Reddit formatted your code. However, if you add the StackTrace to your catch clause, it should tell you the exact line of code where the failure occurs. That could help narrow it down a bit. 
What language is this, is it VBscript or VBA? 
Cleaned up the formatting but would need more info. What exactly is not working? Crashing, never finds match, etc Sub login() Dim username, password As String Dim i, j As Integer Dim ufound, pfound As Boolean i = 0 j = 0 'USERNAME Clear() WriteLine("please enter username") username = ReadLine() FileOpen(1, "usernames.txt", OpenMode.Input) Do i = i + 1 If LineInput(i) = username Then ufound = True WriteLine("username found") ElseIf LineInput(i) &lt;&gt; username Then WriteLine("loading") End If If i = 20 Then WriteLine("username not found") WriteLine("press enter") ReadLine() GoTo restart End If Loop Until i = 20 Or ufound = True FileClose(1)
Instead of "FileOpen".... Try the following For Each Line As String In File.ReadLines("Your file path") If Line.Contains(Term) = True Then ' Do something...Print the line Exit For End If Next
Yes, there is. In fact he application's database must be saved to that folder. I am now attempting to create the setup.exe with the Visual Studio Setup Wizard, but I am clueless as to how do I access that folder from the project and add to then place the database in the shared folder and still manage to install the application and have it run successfully. Also, is it possible to just install the application in the shared folder and automatically create a desktop icon for the rest of the users?
Hi guys, i desperatly need ur help. i am not native speaker so if u dont understand my english please tell me so i can fix my grammar or sth. i was writing a vbnet program and thiis was a for loop in a thread. this program use a byte array to contain bytes from a binary file. so what this loop does is to give do some tiny calculate on each of the byte. so sometimes it runs well, but sometimes it pops up the ArgumentsOutOfRangeException at Form4.ShowDialog(which was written in Form2). It is very confusing. It even didn't finish the loop(it is in Form4) in the thread and just jump to Form2?? I at most have 45 minutes for using a vpn so maybe i cannot reply fast. Thank you!!
Hey how can i upload another picture
This is a specific version of the error infomation. ignore the chinese: {System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException: 索引超出范围。必须为非负值并小于集合大小。 参数名: index 在 System.Collections.ArrayList.get_Item(Int32 index) 在 System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripItemCollection.get_Item(Int32 index) 在 System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip.OnPaint(PaintEventArgs e) 在 System.Windows.Forms.Control.PaintWithErrorHandling(PaintEventArgs e, Int16 layer) 在 System.Windows.Forms.Control.WmPaint(Message&amp; m) 在 System.Windows.Forms.Control.WndProc(Message&amp; m) 在 System.Windows.Forms.ScrollableControl.WndProc(Message&amp; m) 在 System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip.WndProc(Message&amp; m) 在 System.Windows.Forms.StatusStrip.WndProc(Message&amp; m) 在 System.Windows.Forms.Control.ControlNativeWindow.OnMessage(Message&amp; m) 在 System.Windows.Forms.Control.ControlNativeWindow.WndProc(Message&amp; m) 在 System.Windows.Forms.NativeWindow.DebuggableCallback(IntPtr hWnd, Int32 msg, IntPtr wparam, IntPtr lparam)}
This was very helpful, I accomplished what I needed. Thank you very much!
What is happening in the Form4 load event that seems to be doing something with FindString/FindExactString? 
I cannot see, so I am guessing that FORM4 is an existing class and you have not created an instance of that class eg: Dim frm4 as New Form4 frm4.ShowDialog\(\)
You should name the buttons with appropriate name such as btnSubmit. As for the error, you should check your array because that error usually means it’s going beyond the array.
no no no. i do have a form 4. and the bug is occured when i was doing a loop in form4. somtimes its fine but sometimes (even the loop is not finished) it just jump to form2 and say Form4.ShowDialog() has AOOR. can i have ur email address so i can show u my code? thank u sir/ma'am
 Private Sub Form4\_Load\(sender As Object, e As EventArgs\) Handles MyBase.Load System.Windows.Forms.Control.CheckForIllegalCrossThreadCalls = False howMuchDoIRunPerSec = 0 Dim fileReader As New System.IO.FileStream\(form2oldfilename, [IO.FileMode.Open](https://IO.FileMode.Open), [IO.FileAccess.Read](https://IO.FileAccess.Read)\) encrypteddataL.Text = "0 B" tobeencrypteddataL.Text = toKbMbGb\(fileReader.Length\) fileReader.Close\(\) End Sub
form4 has a button. when the button is clicked, it starts a thread. and the thread has a loop, where is the bug occured. so basically i have no idea how the hell can i have a argument error. all my arrays doesnt goes out of the range cuz sometimes it runs nicely and sometimes it doesnt\(even read the same file. this program read every byte of a file and do some calculation on every byte so it causes a effect of ecrypting\). can i have ur email address so i can send u my code？ thank u mister/miss

It's ok. I can wait. And I've sent the mail
thank u so much
[https://pastebin.com/eQhjJbNq](https://pastebin.com/eQhjJbNq) Now you can check my form4 codes here. [https://pastebin.com/WLqAwwS6](https://pastebin.com/WLqAwwS6) And my form2 codes.
Any links to guides or general help would be appreciated :\) 
Perhaps you need an exception handler ?
does exception handler means a try\-catch? i already used a try\-catch to cover the the Form4.ShowDialog\(\) sentence, and it still crash, doesn't do the thing in "catch". and when it crash, visual studio pause the program and show me the error message, which is already mentioned above
you can scroll to the bottom to see my pastebin link, if you don't mind. thank you sir.
&gt; I would like to have updated tracks What do you mean by that?
If you want to display the current artist and track from an external source (which radio is), the external source needs to provide this information along with the actual audio stream. The WMP plug-in allows you to retrieve information about current media. For i = 0 To wmp.currentMedia.attributeCount - 1 MsgBox(wmp.currentMedia.getItemInfo(wmp.currentMedia.getAttributeName(i))) Next Just play the source and see what info you get.
Thanks,
As a test, what happens if you change the line Form4.ShowDialog() to just Form4.Show()? I'm curious as to if the fact that it's opening modal is keeping vs from hilighting another area that is causing this.
i tried what u said, and it works. but i have a question. when i use the Form4.Show(), the form appear behind the Form1! Can i have any method to bring it front? 
Do you have any code at all?
Web scraping https://www.codeguru.com/columns/vb/creating-a-web-text-scraper-with-visual-basic.htm Text search is easy, regular expressions are what you need for this. https://www.regular-expressions.info/dotnet.html Autofill information in a form is based upon the return value of your searches. Discord bots are an advanced topic. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeCXjkd26o8 Good luck! 
Thanks so much! Ill check then out and see where i get today. 
Hello, i have a basic UI setup with fields to input info etc. I dont have the code to actually take the text they input then save it and then call it later and use it to autofill information on sites.
There is a Form property called BringToFront that you could probably use for this. There's also a .TopMost property but that would keep it in front of everything including another application (ie, browser) that you might open. It might take a combination of BringToFront and SendToBack on each of the 2 forms open to get the result you want. As far as your program. I have tried 8 different files multiple times and cannot get an error. These are all over 600K and of different types. 
Google `Git Cheat Sheet` first result is what you are looking for.
The Git Tower cheat sheet is handy, it didn't really answer if that's what I need to be able to create some sort of Git Object that I can run from code. It still feels like I need to create a Command Line and run the commands that way.
Do you know what git is?
why not just use https://gitforwindows.org/ ? looks like there's libraries in their github, but not com, .net, or VB specific.
Let's start over... Here is my current implementation [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/9YMNqUd3) At the bottom there is a function called Execute Command. It uses the command line to run the Git commands. When there is an error with Git, the ExitCode is always 1 regardless of error. I have to compare the string of the output message to determine the error. I was looking for something I could use that would return actual ExitCodes so I could compare on that instead of on the reply message.
I'm currently using the cli by opening a command prompt and calling "git &lt;command&gt;", but the exit code from the command prompt is always 1 regardless of error. I was looking to see if there was an actual object I could reference and call Git commands from to get more meaningful exit codes so I can figure out what the error actually is.
Okay i got the GUI sorted and its all working. Now i need to take the user input fields and somehow save them and then call upon them later when auto filling on website. Im having some difficulty coding the part that has to save the users data. If anyone could help, thanks! 
can you be more specific? maybe you're getting the return code of the command prompt?
So, you have to guess if the next card is lower or higher with a button click? Ps. "You have drew" should be "It's a draw." 
Yes you click lower if you think the card on the left is lower and higher if the card on the right is higher. But the card on the left is sometimes lower but it displays as incorrect.
First of all, you need to refactor the select case into it's own function: Private Sub GetCard2() intcard2 = getRandom() Select Case intcard2 Case 1 PicCard2.Image = My.Resources.C2 Case 2 PicCard2.Image = My.Resources.C3 Case 3 PicCard2.Image = My.Resources.C4 Case 4 PicCard2.Image = My.Resources.C5 Case 5 PicCard2.Image = My.Resources.C6 Case 6 PicCard2.Image = My.Resources.C7 Case 7 PicCard2.Image = My.Resources.C8 Case 8 PicCard2.Image = My.Resources.C9 Case 9 PicCard2.Image = My.Resources.C10 Case 10 PicCard2.Image = My.Resources.CA Case 11 PicCard2.Image = My.Resources.CJ Case 12 PicCard2.Image = My.Resources.CQ Case 13 PicCard2.Image = My.Resources.CK End Select And then call it from your procedure, instead of running through all the code twice in both the high and low button. The other problem is, you have the Ace card set up as #10. It should either be #1 in the select or #13. Hope this helps.
How would I call this from a button click? and you're right about the ace no idea why its 10
Just delete all the code that's repeated twice in the high and low button clicks, and replace it with a call to the GetCard2() function I put up there. Don't forget to change Ace to 1 or 13.
[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5ryj5y8aksr8xnb/AADEkCvMorIdh\_8unvIfRcxHa?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5ryj5y8aksr8xnb/AADEkCvMorIdh_8unvIfRcxHa?dl=0) Its now the card higher which is causing the problem, it appears to never allow a win when the card Is higher, this is the whole product although my only problems are on the game form which is named form 2
Can you give me another pastebin? Double check and make sure you didn't move the whole button click to the GetCard2 Sub. You only need to move the code for getting a new card 2.
eh, I was able to find some information, and they basically said most errors do only return an exit code of 1 on errors. There are only specific circumstances that get the other exit codes. So I may just be out of luck.
[https://pastebin.com/ph5fTj9Y](https://pastebin.com/ph5fTj9Y) I haven't I really wish I could figure this out, its due in like an hours time and this is the only thing holding me back
Your ace is still card 10 in the btnStart Sub and the GetCard2 Sub. 
OK, let me get this straight. If I get it right the card on the right becomes the left card and then you guess if the next "right" card will be higher or lower? Because if that's the case then you need to be consistent in moving the card over to the left. Right now you are moving the right card left in one of the buttons and the left card right in the other button. I don't think that's what you're wanting to do.
Yes that's correct and Wait am I switching the left to the right at some point?
they're both case 13 now?
Which one do I need to change i'm so confused
Are aces high or low? If aces are high, then 13. If they're low, then 1.
