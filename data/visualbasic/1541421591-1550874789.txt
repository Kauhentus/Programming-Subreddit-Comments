 If DbConnect() Then Dim SQLCmd As New OleDbCommand With SQLCmd .Connection = cn .CommandText = "Update Tbl_Rental Set Collected = True Where CarID = @SelectedCarID" Then you would define a parameter that tells the Sql statement what @SelectedCardID is. Something probably like: .Parameters.AddWithValue("@SelectedCarId", datcarstocollect.SelectedRows(0).Tag) 
Wow! Thanks..You really help me..I'm still new to VB.Net and not yet familiar of the controls..
There are 2 versions, one for windows forms and one for asp.net (web). Rdlc reports can be tricky but they are pretty powerful for making reports once you get the hang of it
Iirc sometimes you had to do .image=.picture
Dim keyword inherently declares the variable as private. That means you can only use it within the class itself and not access it outside the class. You could declare that variable as friend or public and then you could. However ideally you would create 'name' as a property in the class, not a variable. Public property name as string
Also, he means instantiating, not declaring. Two very different things.
`Private Sub GetRentalDays()` `'Select the rental record for the Current Rental with ID CurrentRentalID` `If DbConnect() Then` `Dim SQLCmd As New OleDbCommand` `With SQLCmd` `.Connection = cn` `.CommandText = "Select Tbl_Rental.RentalID, Tbl_Rental.Noofdays from Tbl_Rental Where RentalID = @CurrentRentalID"` `.Parameters.AddWithValue("@RentalID", CurrentRentalID)` `Dim rs As OleDbDataReader = .ExecuteReader()` `While` [`rs.Read`](https://rs.Read) `RentalDayCount = rs("Noofdays")` `End While` `End With` `End If` `End Sub`
You've got a lot of stuff going on here that you don't need. Lose the while loop and the if statement for starters. Try reading this documentation. [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqlcommand.parameters?view=netframework-4.7.2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqlcommand.parameters?view=netframework-4.7.2)
Your parameter is @CurrentRentalID but you're using @RentalId in the AddWithValue. While I don't think OLEdb cares because it doesn't actually used named parameters but more like placeholders. I guess are you receiving any errors and have you stepped through this code and looked at what the variables hold? I'm making a huge assumption here that you have CurrentRentalID in a wide enough scope to be accessible in this method since you're not passing it to the method. Also, please take the time to hilight your code and click that [&lt;&gt;] button above the editor window to format your code for readability.
Project Properties, go to Compile, Advanced Compile Option, then set your target CPU to x86 or x64.
That's not it. I have all the correct MSIL reference files so I don't need to set that. The issue I'm having is that I cannot locate where this reference is set, in that it isn't listed in any of the normal reference areas that I've looked, so I'm just wondering if there is a sneaky setting somewhere where this might be hiding out so I can remove it.
Yes, you should be able to alias one of the namespaces to another customized name. If you go into your project properties and go to references, there should be an "imported namespaces" listing. Add an entry to that using this syntax: MyCustomReferenceName = ActualNamespace.Scheduler.Whatever Where MyCustomReferenceName can be whatever you want to call it, and ActualNamespace.Scheduler.Whatever is what it would normally be called with in code. Then you can just use MyCustomReferenceName to point to the other version of the namespace and not have ambiguity. 
Awesome! Thanks man. I will try that tonight when i get home. You just made my work day really long because i will be dying of anticipation :)
'Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.Native.dll' is pretty low level and is most likely a dependency dll for one of the dll's you are actually referencing. This warning can safely be ignored. Having said that I feel I should point out that warnings should not concern you all that much. They are informational and don't effect anything. I had a coworker spend 2 days cleaning up all the warnings in our app just to find out that there was literally no advantage to having 0 warnings so those two days were completely wasted. In the rare case where a warning is a show stopper for you, you should change the severity of it in your project properties(under "Compile") so that it shows as an error instead of a warning.
It's a little difficult to see what is wrong without reading the rest of the code. Either the convertion function is returning an erroneous answer (like MMMMI) or the error happens when displaying the answer in a textbox or label (maybe the answer gets concatenated?) 
Excellent.
VB.NET has a native csv reader. I am using it a lot at the moment at work. 
Do you need to do this with VB? Or do you mean you're trying to do it with VBA inside excel? I can think of lots of ways to do this code wise, but if you're not super familiar with VB it could be a big task to tackle for a beginner. If you're not a programmer by trade, can you use one of these methods? https://www.ablebits.com/office-addins-blog/2016/02/25/compare-two-excel-files-sheets/
Thanks for the info! I guess I'll just continue to ignore it as I have been for like the past year, as it has had no ill effects on the program. :)
Maybe a "diffing" program like [WinMerge](http://winmerge.org/) would be a better option? Especially if it's a one-shot type deal.
The [math to check if a point is inside a rhombus](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/312403/how-do-i-determine-if-a-point-is-within-a-rhombus) or a [triangle](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2049582/how-to-determine-if-a-point-is-in-a-2d-triangle) is not that complex, so why not use that?
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.drawing2d.graphicspath.isvisible or perhaps https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.control.region
That math is a little over my head. It's probably simple for others, but I would need somebody to break it down for me. I'm thinking about just writing a flood-fill algorithm. It's probably simpler. 
I think you need and instead of orelse
So how can I change this so that the error message doesn't pop up when i type a number between 1-999
The first part of your if statement is doing the opposite of what you want, so you need to figure out how to reverse it. Right now you're saying it's OK when the key pressed is outside the range you want, so change it to check that the keypress is inside the range you want instead. Another comment already gave you part of the answer. &amp;#x200B; Using KeyChar you can check individual keys and throw the error if they type something that's not a number, but you're not going to catch something like 9999999999 since each of those keys pressed was a 9, which is valid. You could also look at the textbox.textchanged event instead of the keypress event. It might be easier to just check the value of whatever is in the textbox each time it changes. &amp;#x200B;
if this isn't complex I'm a fucking moron
It’s high school level math... :(
IsVisible did the trick. Thanks, u/tweq. Public Function Clicked(x As Single, y As Single) As Boolean Return myPath.IsVisible(x, y) End Function
You have to add it to the form. I can't recall the syntax for that right now
I echo neonexpresso, you have created a table layout panel object, and you modify it, but you don't put it anywhere. So,at the end of the sub the local variable GameTable is dropped and the nice new shiny object it points to falls into garbage collection. Your layout panel object has not been added to the collection of controls that VB runtime uses to draw the form. That can be as simple as me.Controls.add(GameTable) 
Inside your vb. app it's; Windows.Forms.Cursor.Position = New Point(x, y) Outside you need to use the use32 library functions, setCursorPos, and mouse_event.

Instead of a button to run the command every time you might able to use the text changed event for the input text box.
There is a Random class that will give you a random number via .Next(0, 51) &amp;#x200B; [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.random?view=netframework-4.7.2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.random?view=netframework-4.7.2)
Look into the List object. It's much more versatile than arrays. The simplest way to do what you want is to copy the elements to new lists rather than try to modify the existing one. 
you can't. you can use the Immediate window to adhoc pull any sorts values you can get at in code (text fields, positions, visibility, etc.)
Is the assignment really asking for a two dimensional array or that is your idea to accomplish the task? Anyhow, off the top of my head I have to ideas to accomplish what you're saying: 1. The first one, is to create a subroutine (or method) that receives your array by reference and makes use of a do-while loop in which you generate a normal random number to **try to assign** the card/number if it's already assigned to another card skip and repeat until the whole second dimension is full. This one should be easy to implement if you have worked previously with random numbers. 2. Making your own pseudorandom generator. Pseudorandom generators are usually cyclic. It means that they never return a repeat until they cycle (which is exactly what your want). However, the only ones that I know of and is relatively easy to implement isn't that good with small numbers (low random quality). That is the [Linear Congruential Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator) (LCG). Unless you think your professor wouldn't scrutinize the output that closely to notice the not-so-obvious patterns then you could go ahead and use LCG. Also don't try random parameters because even something as simple as the LCG has really strict rules on what generates a [full cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_cycle). These are values that I have verified to generate full cycles and generate a decent looking set: 1. modulus = 52, multiplier = 1, addend = 33 2. modulus = 52, multiplier = 1, addend = 19 3. modulus = 52, multiplier = 1, addend = 15 Note: You can choose any starting seed not greater than 51 (inclusive). This is LCGs pseudo-code &gt;int a, c, m, s; //'a' is multiplier, 'c' is addend, 'm' is modulus, and 's' is your seed &gt; &gt;//I'm using 's' as operand to assign to itself. &gt; &gt;//You repeat this 'm' times and every single return is going to be a unique number from 0 to 51 &gt; &gt;s = (s \* a + c) mod m; &amp;#x200B;
Once you remove the item you want from the array, you'll have to write a function that recompiles the array back into a comma-separated string. For instance: Private Function CommaToString(arr as String()) as String Dim total as string = "" For n = 0 to arr.length - 1 total &amp;= arr(n) 'this ensures that comma is added to every item except the last If n &lt;&gt; arr.length - 1 then total &amp;= "," Next Return total End Function
As long as it isn't during or before a form load or show event, you should be able to just alt-tab to the form. 
Ole object is not a data type. Access converted it to something, my guess is var binary. You need to figure out how it stored the data first
Shouldn't your SQL statement read Where CarID = @SearchID
Ah ok what would the parameters be?
I’ve tried this. And then I wrote an If statement that says if a is pushed and then I wrote image.left=image.left +500 but then when I press the a key nothing happens 
Lesson 1: Show your code. Can't help you if we can't see what you are doing.
Private Sub Form1_KeyDown(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs) Handles Me.KeyDown Select Case e.KeyCode Case Keys.Left Me.PictureBox1.Left -= 1 Case Keys.Up Me.PictureBox1.Top -= 1 Case Keys.Right Me.PictureBox1.Left += 1 Case Keys.Down Me.PictureBox1.Top += 1 End Select End Sub
Minor thing, make your code easier to read here. You want us to help, and many will just walk away if it's that jumbled mess. Not a big deal, but I wanted you to know. Private Sub Form1_KeyDown(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs) Handles Me.KeyDown Select Case e.KeyCode Case Keys.Left Me.PictureBox1.Left -= 1 Case Keys.Up Me.PictureBox1.Top -= 1 Case Keys.Right Me.PictureBox1.Left += 1 Case Keys.Down Me.PictureBox1.Top += 1 End Select End Sub -------------- The code looks fine, but I would try a "+50" to insure that you can see the picturebox moving. Glad to see your using a Select Case instead of IF statements. Another note: Learn to name your objects RIGHT AWAY, like THE MOMENT you create them. No one will know what "PictureBox" is. You want to name things so as you read your code it makes more sense: ie: Snake.left += 10; If the larger value is not working get back to me and I can actually make some code myself to check this, but again, it seems like your code is fine (good for you!) it may be just that a small number (1) is too small for you to notice
Hmm ok I’ll try making a new project and starting from fresh. Maybe it was a problem with the properties or something. I’ll let u know in about 2 hours cause my lunch is over now so I left the class. (I have it again last period in 2 hours)
No worries. Again, if you want I can upload my project and/or you can send me what you have for review. jameswrose@outlook.com
Well your SQL statement is this: "Select Tbl_Car.PIC from Tbl_Car Where CarID = SelectedCarID" So SQL Server is expecting there to be some value called "SelectedCarID", but that doesn't actually exist within SQL Server, that is some variable from your code. So you could do this: "Select Tbl_Car.PIC from Tbl_Car Where CarID = " &amp; SelectedCarID but that is considered bad form, because it can open up your code to SQL injection attacks in theory. You always want to use parameters for variables in your queries. So you make your SQL Statement this: "Select Tbl_Car.PIC from Tbl_Car Where CarID = @SearchID" The @SearchID is your parameter and your next line of code sets its value .Parameters.AddWithValue("@SearchID", SelectedCarID) So that when the SQL Statement is executed, @SearchID is replaced with your variable SelectedCarID's value.
I've tried that and it still doesn't work. Have I read it from the database correctly I'm using rs.read with the database
I have the picture as an OLE object in the database and I just copied and pasted the image into the cell 
Which specific line of code is throwing the runtime error?
It's the picCar.Image = Image.FromStream(imageByteData) line My image isnt in binary is that the problem? 
If your image is being stored in the actual database table, then it certainly should be an array of bytes unless you did something special like covert it to a base64 string (which I will assume you did not). What is the data type of the "PIC" field in the database? If you set a break point on that line of code, and then when the code breaks into the debugger, you mouse over imageByteDate, does it show to have valid data in it? 
In the database it's an OLE object and I just copied and pasted the picture into the cell and it just came up as 'Picture' . Also which line of code exactly do you mean, to set the breakpoint?
This is an access database? The breakpoint should be set on the line throwing the error. That way it will break to that line before it executes it and errors, and you can hover over the variables to take a look and make sure their values are what we would expect them to be there.
I've hovered over the line throwing the error the line starting with piccar.image If I hover over imageByteData it just says ImageByteData {System.IO.MemoryStream} If I hover above the line above it ImageByteData is Nothing 
i have this : Private Sub txtNumero\_TabIndexChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles txtNumero.TabIndexChanged If txtNumero.Text &gt; 1 Or txtNumero.Text &lt; 999 Then Else MsgBox("!") &amp;#x200B; End If but it still does not work &amp;#x200B;
You want textchanged, not tabindexchanged. And you'll need to look up how to convert text to a number for the comparison. 
I sent u an email :)
Post your code you're using to try to connect, and the error you're getting, for starters. 
As the rare person who doesn't like to shit on VB and thinks it's a perfectly viable language, this sub is slowly changing my opinion of it because 90% of the posts on here are something along the lines of How do I make amazon.com in excel, please halp. 
 Keyword not supported: 'datasource'. That means your connection string is wrong. You'll want to look up the proper way to connect to a mysql db. This is a guess but try replacing datasource= with server= A couple other things. If you're ever connecting to a db, you want to wrap that in a using clause. It will help make sure connections always get closed should something go wrong. Also, directly putting input values into a sql statement is bad idea. What if I typed O'Connor for the last name, the single ' would terminate your statement and make it error out. That would be an honest mistake. What if I typed '; TRUNCATE TABLE datasheet; That would delete all the data from your datasheet table (it's called a sql injection attack) Look into paramatizing inputs when doing sql calls. Let me know if you have any questions.
seriously i know little of what you are talking about here (A couple other things. If you're ever connecting to a db, you want to wrap that in a using clause. It will help make sure connections always get closed should something go wrong. You'll likely want to globalize your connection string too, like putting it in a config or resource file. What happens when you've built 10 pages that all have that hard coded and your connection string needs to change, all of a sudden you have to modify them all. What if you made 100 pages like that? Putting it in one spot and referencing it means you'll only have to change it once. Also, directly putting input values into a sql statement is bad idea. What if I typed O'Connor for the last name, the single ' would terminate your statement and make it error out. That would be an honest mistake. What if I typed '; TRUNCATE TABLE datasheet; That would delete all the data from your datasheet table (it's called a sql injection attack) Look into paramatizing inputs when doing sql calls to avoid that.) although i changed 'datasource' to 'server' ........ still getting error
Yea /u/JamesWjRose helped me set that all up. Appreciate ur reply though :)
What's the error? If you want help you need to try and post as many details as possible.
Additional information: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version for the right syntax to use near ''datasheet'('firstname', 'lastname', 'Email', 'Phone') VALUES ('emeka', 'omolomo' at line 1 the above is the error its displaying after i downloaded the right version of mysql connector for vb.net........... i know i'm also there, just need to tweek few things and get it done...
Dim command As New MySqlCommand("INSERT INTO 'datasheet'('firstname','lastname','Email','Phone') VALUES ('" &amp; TextBox1.Text &amp; "', '" &amp; TextBox2.Text &amp; "', '" &amp; TextBox3.Text &amp; "', '" &amp; TextBox4.Text &amp; "')", connection) connection.Open() If command.ExecuteNonQuery() = 1 Then MsgBox("successfully inserted") Else MsgBox("fail to insert") End If the above is the code....where do i insert the dim insql?
You're setting a varaible inSql equal to your insert string "INSERT INTO 'datasheet'('firstname','lastname','Email','Phone') VALUES ('" &amp; TextBox1.Text &amp; "', '" &amp; TextBox2.Text &amp; "', '" &amp; TextBox3.Text &amp; "', '" &amp; TextBox4.Text &amp; "')" so you can see what the actual insert string is, that gets generated to test it manually. You may want to try out some beginner courses so you understand what a variable is, before you jump into trying to connect and insert things to a database. 
This is a guess, but trackbar.Scroll looks like the actual object trackbar. I.e. if you said trackbar.Scroll = someValue it would scroll the trackbar that much. trackbar_Scroll looks like an auto generated method by VS. The code inside that method would run every time the trackbar is scrolled in the form by the user. Look for something like Sub trackbar_Scroll(sender As object, ea as EventArgs) or something close to that. They're not really the same thing at all, they just happen to have the same names due to the way VS names methods. If you gave your trackbar a different ID like myTrackBar and then did an onscroll event, the name would change to myTrackBar_Scroll
If I have multiple track bars, is it possible for me to a set a limit to the total of those values so the total cannot be above a certain value
Yea, you'd want a variable scoped to the entire page. Somthing like private _totalTracks as decimal = 0 Then, in any method where a track bar is scrolling you'd do _totalTracks = _totalTracks + theNewTrackAmount Then you'd probably want a function that returns true or false that checks _totalTracks against whatever that value you determine is the max so you could always just call that function and if it's false, you can say "you can't scroll anymore" or whatever your requirement is
I'd have to see your whole code file to help
&gt; Public Class Form1 Private_totalTracks As Decimal = 0 'Strength Private Sub StatSTR_Scroll(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles statSTR.Scroll STRvalue.Text = "Strength:" &amp; statSTR.Value End Sub 'Perception Private Sub statPER_Scroll(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles statPER.Scroll PERvalue.Text = "Perception:" &amp; statPER.Value End Sub 'Endurance Private Sub statEND_Scroll(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles statEND.Scroll ENDvalue.Text = "Endurance:" &amp; statEND.Value End Sub 'Charisma Private Sub statCHA_Scroll(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles statCHA.Scroll CHAvalue.Text = "Charisma:" &amp; statCHA.Value End Sub 'Intelligence Private Sub statINT_Scroll(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles statINT.Scroll INTvalue.Text = "Intelligence:" &amp; statINT.Value End Sub 'Agility Private Sub statAGI_Scroll(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles statAGI.Scroll AGIvalue.Text = "Agility:" &amp; statAGI.Value End Sub 'Luck Private Sub statLCK_Scroll(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles statLCK.Scroll LCKvalue.Text = "Luck:" &amp; statLCK.Value End Sub End Class 
So I've sorted that issue out but now I don't know how to get the value to live update as the value only shows up when clicking on the label
Its working perfectly now..... I removed the quotes in the ( 'firstname', lastname', 'Email', 'Phone') Thanks very much
Glad to help. I actually thought that might be the problem, but I'm not familiar enough with mysql anymore to say off the top of my head. 
i'm not sure what you mean?
Do you know your way around laravel?
You would do that in your scroll method I was mentioning earlier. You should be able to go to the properties of your trackbar, and generate an on scroll event, that code will fire every time the scroll bar is moved. So then you check the position of it, and if it's &gt; than 40 your button gets enabled, otherwise it doesn't. I'm taking a guess here, but if you're trying to force someone to scroll all the way through something before they can click a button, you don't need to track the total scroll amount, you just want to know if the position it's at = whatever the number is to mean it's at the end. If that's the case your button gets enabled. If you were tracking the total it moved, moving it up or down could potentially skirt that as it would keep adding the amount
No. But that is a PHP thing, why are you wondering about that?
It does require a two dimensional array. I tried to make this function to control the random generation but I can't make it output to check and see whether or not it is actually doing anything because I don't know how to output that spot in the array to a text box. &amp;#x200B; Function drawPlayBottom() intPlayBottom = [rand.Next](https://rand.Next)(51) If deck(intPlayBottom, 1) = intPlayBottom Then Do Until deck(intPlayBottom, 1) = String.Empty intPlayBottom = [rand.Next](https://rand.Next)(51) Loop deck(intPlayBottom, 1) = intPlayBottom Else deck(intPlayBottom, 1) = intPlayBottom End If &amp;#x200B; Return deck(intPlayBottom, 0) End Function &amp;#x200B; the idea is that intPlayBottom is the card being played. Every time I run this function, theoretically, it should generate a random number, and check to see if the second slot in the array is filled. if it is, loop again. if it is empty, then insert it there and return the top spot of the array which is tied to the card.
Trackbar_Scroll looks like an event but I could be way off. 
That was my original guess. Does it say handles and then something after that at the send of that line
I got it working thx everyone for your help
Hint 1: Try using textbox1.split("+","-") to get the number of numbers
What are you dropping this label in? Is there any reason you can't define it client side? 
Because the user can decide how many labels should be created. I figured it out how to do it and I’m gonna post the way I did it soon so that this post could help some other people out in the future.
What's your overall problem you're trying to solve?
Is this a homework assignment that is specifically requiring you to do it with if statements?
I'd go overkill and use regex to count characters for me: &amp;#x200B; Dim count As Integer = New Regex("\[+\\-\\/\*\]+").Matches(myWPFTextBox.Text).Count &amp;#x200B; Makes it easy to add new operators to the counter down the line.
Could you put the input names into three different variables, then for each possible combination, check if it's equal to the sorted list? I'm not sure if that's what you're having to check or not. Something along the lines of (sorry if formatting gets messed up, I'm on mobile): Dim a As String = input 1 Dim b As String = input 2 Dim c As String = input 3 Dim list As String(2) If list(0) = a If list(1) = b list(2) = c If list = Array.Sort(list) Return list Else End If ElseIf list(1) = c list(2) = b If list = Array.Sort(list) Return list Else End If End If ElseIf list(0) = b ......... And so on and so forth
Yeahhh, it looks like that formatting didn't keep. Hopefully this is a little more readable: Dim a As String = input 1 Dim b As String = input 2 Dim c As String = input 3 Dim list As String(2) If list(0) = a If list(1) = b list(2) = c If list = Array.Sort(list) Return list Else End If ElseIf list(1) = c list(2) = b If list = Array.Sort(list) Return list Else End If End If ElseIf list(0) = b ......... 
^^^ Holy shit, how'd I make it do that?! Much better ^^^
I cant really use arrays/lists, i have to use nested if statements Like if name1 &gt; name 2 then output name1, name 2 else output name 2 name 1 But i have 3 names so i have 6 different ways of writing the name order but i need to check all 6 using nested if statements and also some and and or statements now i just realised 
List(Of String) is the way to go. I only use arrays if needed by other functionality. 
Yes this should be possible. I assume you are missing a reference to System.Windows.Forms. Here are some google results on how to add a reference in Visual Studio as a starter: https://www.google.com/search?q=visual+studio+add+reference&amp;rlz=1C1GGRV_enDE751DE751&amp;oq=visual+studio+add+ref&amp;aqs=chrome.2.69i57j69i65j0l4.3823j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8
Thanks for your reply. The class library project targets .NetStandard and when you try to add references, the system.windows.forms isnt there... It's my first time trying to create a class library that references windows form controls so I reckon I'm missong somethong elementary. 
WinForms isn't compatible with .NET Standard. You'll have to target .NET Framework instead.
You don't need to compare 6 different ways... It can be figured out playing around with 3 numbers written on pieces of paper on your desk. It should take you much less than 6 comparisons to do it... 
Hmm okay. So I assume if name 1 &gt; name 2 = True, that means name 1 comes before name 2 in alphabetical order? Running with that assumption could you do something like: If name 1 &gt; name 2 Then If name 2 &gt; name 3 Then Output name 1 name 2 name 3 ElseIf name 1 &gt; name 3 If name 3 &gt; name 2 Then Output name 1 name 3 name 2 Else Output name 1 name 2 name 3 End If End If ElseIf name 2 &gt; name 3 And so on for the others. You could also do like if name 1 &gt; name 2 and name 2 &gt; name 3, if you have to use ands in the if statements
search results for "perlin noise vb" seem to have some promising things. not sure it's really complex enough to need a whole library, but you could certainly put the function in a class and add features.
Thanks for all your help! 
&gt; I didn't download it. I did. It doesn't even unzip. Says the file is corrupt. Plus it looks like vb6 implimentation. Not sure if that even works on .net. 
that's unfortunate. I'm sure the algorithm could be ported, it really doesn't seem that complex.
Wait.. The good part is that let OP write perlin noise in P5js and embed the page in a webbrowser control :D just learn to workaround different langs..
Move the actual creation of the node to a Sub and then call it from a loop for as many times as the user indicates
It’s a bit difficult because you don’t define the limits or tell about your skills/how much you have learned. Can you elaborate a little about what you expect to be able to do? You say that some guys made a chess game. Did that include an AI or was it ‘just’ co-op?
I wasn't there but I think it was just co-op. In the class, we worked our way through the VB book and I learned the basics, if/then, loops, etc. I'm willing to learn anything else and there's 2 levels of Programming students also in the room who have already taken the course so I can get help from them too. It's a very loose assignment (which is usually not me). We just have to demonstrate our skills, the teacher isn't gonna get upset if we don't have "one of everything," just so long as we work hard on it and show that we learned something.
That's why I did it. My massage therapist saved my back and I couldn't stand watching her write out receipts by hand. She told me it took half an hour to figure out her tax remittance each month.
That's pretty cool, good that you could help her out like that.
I'll definitely look into that, thanks.

Conway's Game of Life is kind of game-like, but it would be much easier to implement than an actual 1 or 2 player game, IMO. It's something that would both look cool, but might be easier to get done in your semester than a real game. You could also 3D print or stickerize one of the oscillators that can appear in the game. Note that you would have to get a little familiar with GDI+ from the .Net framework. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life 
That looks really cool and I'll find out if I can feasibly get that done in time. Any resources you can point me towards to help (mostly for more advanced coding concepts I need to know)?
Drawing shapes with GDI+ https://www.w3computing.com/vb2008/drawing-shapes-gdi/ . You'll need to know how draw out a grid or squares on a form. Other than that, it's going to involve loops and arrays. 
Thank you so much, I think I'm gonna try it. It looks like everything I like in one
Use a for loop and do the calculations and just output them each time
So like For int numbers then do the math 2 * 2 3 * 3 4 * 4 5 * 5 then Next display the answers simply.
You definitely should make a separate class. Then in your main form (assuming you're using a form based application), make it Shared and Friend. That way, you can just access it using your form class name like "Form1.SerialObject"
Your for is backwards. You're saying go from 5 to 1. It should be 1 to 5. Also, you just want to step by 1. Do the math inside the for loop
Yea but in your for loop you're modifying intnum so you are increasing it. Use a new variable inside your for loop
Why are you setting int num at all. Just use it for the for loop and that's it
My point is you're modifying it inside your for loop. That's why it's not working. The for loop variable can't be modified by anything but the for loop itself in this case

windows api for MCI, http://pinvoke.net/default.aspx/winmm.mciSendString
&gt; make the drive spin without a disc in it. Maybe there's a "check to see if a disk is in the drive" command that he runs in a loop.
There is a spin command: [https://docs.microsoft.com/pl-pl/windows/desktop/Multimedia/spin](https://docs.microsoft.com/pl-pl/windows/desktop/Multimedia/spin)
Start by writing down your approach. Step by step. Break those steps down into smaller steps. That doesn't have to be done on paper or even actually physically "written" in any way, if you can keep it in your brain. Programming is about translating steps from your brain into computer language. If you don't know what the steps are, you're just wasting your time trying to write a program.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.datetime
Look at the DATEDIFF function, you'll get what you want there.
Thank you! So simple. 
Thanks all! I knew this was a simple fix. 
I'm sorry, however I am a beginner at Visual Basic. Here is my code, can someone help me correct it and explain why it is written incorrectly?

You are missing an equals sign
You’re missing an equals sign between “as integer” and dblMonthly
ooouuup got it, thank you! 
&gt;I was also told i need to use div and modulus operators I don't think so, this should work (untested): Public Sub Calc() Dim input_Hour As String = "3" Dim input_Minutes As String = "15" Dim Duration_Hour As String = "2" Dim Duration_Minutes As String = "35" Dim t_Input As New System.TimeSpan(0, input_Hour, input_Minutes, 0) Dim t_Duration As New System.TimeSpan(0, Duration_Hour, Duration_Minutes, 0) Dim t_Complete As System.TimeSpan = t_Input.Add(t_Duration) Debug.Print(t_Complete.ToString) End Sub 
Yes you're right. I quickly caught that one too I just needed the thing to run to check the calculation. Thank you!! 
I'll check it out! Thanks
Your ListBox1.Items.Add line needs to be in an Else statement. Basically If Value Too Big Then modify textbox with error message ElseIf Value Too Small Then modify textbox with error message Else ' Value just right so add textbox value to listbox &amp;#x200B; You should probably do a [System.Int32.TryParse](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.int32.tryparse?view=netframework-4.7.2) for the value though. Or if your accepting decimals, then the equivalent. I see your doing Val. Val isn't very useful, it just returns a double for the first numeric value in the string. It throws away the non-numeric parts. So 1232.4football becomes 1232.4. It is very poor for sanitizing data. If the value is non-numeric, I forget what Val will do. It might throw an error which you haven't handled. &amp;#x200B; So your first check would be Dim intValue as System.Int32 If System.Int32.TryParse(tbadd.Text, intValue) Then Then in subsequent lines you would use the value intValue to do your comparison. &amp;#x200B;
Ok, your code isn't super clear but I see what's going on now. Unless you HAVE to put that message in the text box, I would add a label next to the text box. You can then set the label text instead of changing what they typed in, into the textbox. Then just throw it all in a 3 step if else if too big set label to too big text else if too small set label to too small text else set label to "" add value to list box end if Also, you'll likely want to validate what they inserted was a number, or you could run into errors in actual use. so if not isNumeric(tbadd.text) set label text to hey that's not a number add that to the beginning of your if else statements. Hope that helps
Yea I didn't catch from that snippet that he still needed to actually add the text if it is within the range. I added another reply b/c he will also want to check if it's numeric first
It does help but i do have to put that message in the textbox and at the same time not have that message added in the listbox
THANKS! This was super helpful adding that Else really solved the problem!
If textbox1.text IsNumeric = false then Textbox1.text = “” Msgbox(“you have contracted syphillis”
You can also look at Mask Text Box: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-working-with-the-maskedtextbox-control](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-working-with-the-maskedtextbox-control) One thing about UX, you want to avoid allowing the user to do something and then "yelling" at them for doing so. ie: ZIP Code boxes and the use of things like IsNumeric at the KeyUp event. A mask will only allow them to enter in the required values. There are, of course, exceptions to this mindset.
You say VBA but your example has a handles statement, which generally indicates vb.net. The vba way would have been IsNumeric. But in vb.net you have the [TryParse](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.double.tryparse?view=netframework-4.7.2) method of the the integer or double types. Whichever you're trying to accept. Most of the time you don't want to just know if the input is numeric, you want it as an actual numeric type as well. There are also the Convert.ToX methods.
I am actually taking a course on it..... It safer and advanced than WordPress
Sorry that was a type it should have been Listbox.Items.item(A) when i posted this 
Is numeric will return true in cases where it's not all numbers in the test string. An example would be if someone enters a dollar sign, like "$1.00" isnumeric returns true, but the string will fail any numeric conversion call.
Had the same problem with handling large data and creating eybamic controls for each value. If you use Winforms, this becomes more difficult since the rendering uses old method. In WPF, it's a bit. faster. So here are some tips to optimize it. Read the file in a background thread (seperate from ui thread. This will stop the problem of UI freezing. Xan do by using background worker too. While you load the components or print them, suspendlayout() and then when all omponents loaded, do resumelayout(). If you create controls or graphics for values, use DoubleBuffered = True in winforms. Here is another good trick to create the components faster after loading values - Arrays.. Store the values in arrays and then print/create contorl using For Each loop. Hope this helps. 
Will create a post here named : Winforms Optimization after collecting resources and codes.
Hmm. Yes you're right then. Your algorithm is good enough, so it's the problem with .net.. For a more faster read, maybe use other language &amp; get the results through memory output.. maybe write a quick C/C++ script, run it through vb via process.start() and get the split text console outputs into vb array.. 
I've done this before with arrays. Your first list is values you're searching for and your second list is the values it hits on. E.g. SearchTerm Value 0 "A" 4 "X" 7 "R" Then you loop through your arrays. For i = 1 to Ubound(vals) If SearchTerm(i) = Vals(i) Then Next i Apologies if I'm not explaining well, I'm on mobile. 
If you are bound to the csv files then you should read them all at once and store them into an array or list. After that you split the lines and store the informations you are comparing to in own objects which you then can compare faster. The problem in your performance comes likely from the file access and the .split so you wanna try to do this only once and then keep it in memory. But i cant tell for sure if this really helps because it depends on the rest of your code. Is it a single user app or is it a webapp and other stuff is important to answer that If you are not bound to the csv you may want to look up SQLite, a database which is intended for what you want to do. This aproach would cost you some time to rewrite (and learn databases) but would it would be a future proof solution
False MS just doesn't care
Well it hasn't had a stable build release for 20 months now. Until MS surprises us it's kinda in limbo in terms of development, but both VB.NET apps and VBA macros are still quite commonly used.
Sounds like you need a database.
Visual Basic is still great for hobbyists and students, but I don't recommend it for professional work. The lack of support from Microsoft and cultural issues makes it difficult to justify in a business setting even though technologically it has many advantages over c#.
you're using C code, the link I provided above has VB examples. here's another random VB usage https://pastebin.com/5BJq1bQX
The program generates them for itself. I'm only bound to csv files because I don't know how to do anything else. [VB.net](https://VB.net) is my only programming language, and even then i'm really only passably competent in text data reading and writing. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
If the program generates them, it could easily insert the data into a database table. Think of a database as an excel sheet that's a little more advanced to use (requires some sql knowledge) but in return gives you A LOT more power and scallability. I'd definitely recommend you look into putting that data in a DB as opposed to csvs. Your work where you're looping through the data would remain relatively the same, and you could also then use entity framework, where then intellisense would help with column names and syntax and what not. Vb.net can absolutely handle this. I manage an enterprise class management system that was built entirely in VB. We are going through a rewrite and using c#, but that's mainly because it a lot easier to find good c# devs. Functionality wise, either language would handle it just fine. 
How would I go about doing this in VB.net? The search results I'm getting are all referring to SQL. 
Well yes, you'd create a database. And to interact with a database at a base level (no pun intended) you use sql. You'd have to google it a little, but the basic syntax is fairly straight forward. From there you can use the sql connector in visual basic to execute sql commands against the database to retrieve the data. It's the same concept as you're doing now, where you're saying give me all the info on X person, you'd just write that in sql. 
VB has been seen as the tool of novices and incompetent programmers since the 90's. Even when it was indisputably the best programming language for professional business applications it had this bad reputation. This equates to lower wages and a reluctance for professionals to use it. Which in turn means it doesn't get sample code, tooling, or new platform support at the same rate as C#. And of course that drives away more professionals. (I quite using it, except when teaching, when they started threatening to not support it in ASP.NET Core 1.0.) 
I believe that the `finalprice += checktype + colorresult` is the source of your trouble. Because of the +=, every time you click the `btnCalc`, you take the existing value of `finalprice`, and adding it to the results of `checktype + colorresult`. &amp;#x200B; So the first time you run the program, the value of `finalprice` will be 0, the result will be as you expect. Subsequent clicks will be the sum of the previous result and the other values. &amp;#x200B; I think that the root of the problem is the way you are adding 25 to `finalprice` in the `If chkFold.Checked = True Then`. You should either reset `finalprice` to 0 at the start of the sub. This should mitigate the problem. 
👆This is a better practice anyways. 
Thank you! I knew I was missing something very simple. Every time I have problems it always seems to be. 
I use the error handler when I execute the SP It will tell you the error ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Private Sub entrar_Click() Dim Iderror, ilargo As Integer On Error GoTo ErrHandler . . .. .. cadenaSQL = "call gn_login (2,'" + uss + "', '" + cla + "', @salida);" Set RS = conn.Execute(cadenaSQL) ErrHandler: If Err.Number &lt;&gt; 0 Then Call MsgBox("Error #" &amp; Err.Number &amp; ": " &amp; Err.Description, vbCritical + vbOKOnly, "DB error") End If End Sub 
Use the numericupdown control. 
Dim viuex as.... What?
You're calculating the new string, but you never do anything with it. You have to assign it to a control when you're done.
Ok I got it but now what. When i press the button it just goes blank Private Sub btnInverse\_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles [btnInverse.Click](https://btnInverse.Click) Dim nouveaux As String = "" Dim Insert As String = txtInsert.Text Dim Lenght As Integer = txtInsert.TextLength - 1 &amp;#x200B; For Character As Integer = 0 To Lenght Dim vieux As String = Insert.Substring(Character, 1) nouveaux.Insert(0, vieux) Next Character lblInverse.Text = nouveaux End Sub
[For loops](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/statements/for-next-statement) don't have to go forward. You can have it go backwards through the string. Just provide the Step -1 argument to the for loop and reverse the start and ending index arguments. Then your just appending to the new string, instead of trying to insert the character at the front. Anyway the problem with your code is that you are not saving the result of the [.Insert](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string.insert?view=netframework-4.7.2) call. You are ignoring the return value which is the new string created from the two input strings.
This is a subreddit for helping out with visual studio. Not teaching basic programming pseudo code. If people can't get the basics down, they should pay better attention in class.
Ok, I’ve made some progress! Now, Clicking “CommandImport” will import the old table, append the records to the new table, and then delete the imported table. Works like a charm! The only thing I need to figure out now, is how to allow the user to browse to find OldDatabase.accdb (or whatever it’s named). Does anyone know how I can allow this to be changed? Here’s the code I’m working with now: Private Sub CommandImport_Click() Application.DoCmd.TransferDatabase acImport, "Microsoft Access", "C:\Users\me\Desktop\OldDatabase\OldDatabase.accdb", acTable, "Files", "Files Import" DoCmd.RunSQL "INSERT INTO [Files] SELECT * FROM [Files Import] " DoCmd.DeleteObject acTable, "Files Import" MsgBox ("Your records were successfully imported") End Sub Any help would be much appreciated!
Your for loop is really wrong. You want the loop to run `startnumber` times, and add `endnumber`each time.
Can you pass form1 as an object? Then go through each object on the form, check if it's a text box, and add it's value to the array.
By doing this would I be able to store the data from the text boxes into a private array in the module?
It sounds like you'd need to use sender properties, or can you just use functions in the Module? So for example you'd have a function that takes an input as string and then when someone clicks a button on form 1, it calls that function with a text box's contents as the input
Can you explicitly not use functions? If you can, in the Module you'd just have something like Function DoStuff(user Input as String) Dim output 'do stuff Return output End Function Then in your form, for the button clicked event, you'd have like value = Module1.DoStuff(Me.TextBox1.Text)
This is probably one of the easiest ways. The benefit of learning to do it this way is that it lets you write reusable functions that can be called by any form in your project.
not like that. and what you have won't do that anyway. you can use the Mid() function to look at each digit. personally, I'd use arrays for the lookups, then loop backwards through the entry text digits. but if this is for an assignment, you need to use the tools you've been taught.
I havent been taught mid0function, I've only been taught if, and string and integers 
then you're pretty much stuck there until you learn more. this could just be a step in that learning.
Note: this solution isn’t efficient, but this is personally an easy way to explain it. I’m not quite sure what your asking, but the way I would honestly knock this out is by counting the number based on the actual units that Roman numerals give you. (Ex: I,V,X .etc) I would hook up a divider (with remainder) to each and just repeat until you had a specific amount of each value, from there the rest is fairly simple, you would need to write a bit to simply interpret the values and convert the instances of four and 9 to IV or whatever the applicable units are. From there just put everything in order and you’re set. TLDR; I would divide each unit or “level” independently store the output and plug the remainder into the next level. From there take count of how many for each level and put it in order.
 "You can assign it back to the same variable " And how would I do that? Is that not what "lblInverse.Text = nouveaux" is doing?
You do it like this: `nouveaux = nouveaux.Insert(0, vieux)` [System.String.Insert](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string.insert?view=netframework-4.7.2) is a function that returns a new string. So you have to do something with the return value by assigning it to a variable. &amp;#x200B; &gt; Is that not what "lblInverse.Text = nouveaux" is doing? No. Your working variable nouveaux is the new string you're building. At least that is what you intended. But by not using the return value from the Insert function, your nouveaux string never changes. You need it to change. This line: `lblInverse.Text = nouveaux` Assigns your working variable for the string your building to the control. Currently in your code, you only initialized this variable to the empty string. Then you never assign it anything else or append to it. So at the end when you make this statement, you are assigning the empty string to the control. &amp;#x200B; I said earlier there is an easier to understand way by going through the string backwards with your for loop. Then you would just be appending to the string. This appending operation is easier to understand. `nouveaux = nouveaux &amp; vieux` Here you can clearly understand your are taking the value of nouveaux and appending vieux and then assigning that to nouveaux. There is a shortcut operand &amp;= but I would avoid that if you're a beginner.
Nobody offers examples in VB anymore. Learn to write in C# or ask us to help you translate.
javascript and python you're more likely to find a full featured, well documented, well supported library. if you can find a C# .NET library, you should be able to use it in VB too.
I'm a newbie. How much different is c#. Is it just a matter of learning how the code lays out and the syntax? Is all the visual studio GUI stuff all the same?
Syntax. (And a very small number of features.) That's it. You write the code the same way. Projects are organized the same way. The VS tools are the same. If you can write VB code, you can read C# code in less than a day.
Great thank you. I'll start moving over to C# . I keep seeing people recommend it on here. 
Yep. I used to do that all the time.
I'm sorry to see it go because I did like VB better. But even die hard VB fans like me have realized that its been relegated to a secondary role and will be used mainly by beginners and hobbyists in the future.
Yeah it's definitely a shame but I guess it is what it is. Just happy to hear the transition won't be too bad. It's intimidating enough being a beginner.
Exactly to the point. VB is a great and easy language &amp; I hated C# by the syntax of it (even though I coded heavily in C/C++, python and java). The declerations and autocomplete felt so smooth. Just 3 days back *forced* myself to start C# and boom! Not shifting back just because of such a large community. It's the same as vb because same .net.. So why not + also easier to convert algorithms from other langs to C# because - syntax..
While [Strings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/string-basics) are technically reference types in vb.net, meaning you are passing around pointers, you can treat them like value types in most cases because of the immutability. When you assign a string to another string variable, more than just the pointer is copied. The whole string is duplicated. The [Text](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.textbox.text?view=netframework-4.7.2) property of the textbox returns a string. So based on the above, it is not returning a reference to the string in the textbox. It is making a copy and giving you that copy. So now you have two places in memory with the same contents but at different addresses. So now let's talk about your code. You are doing an implicit type conversion when you do `If N1 = 1 Then`. You are forcing the 1 to be converted to a string and then compared. You should be explicit in any comparison to avoid unexpected consequences from implicit type conversions. So I would change that to `If N1 = "1" Then`. You have code commented out for assigning the "I" to the textbox. Why did you comment that out and try and use R1? The code works just as you wrote. The value of "I" will be in the variable R1. But it won't be in the textbox. &amp;#x200B; It looks like you're trying to write an integer number to Roman Numeral string program. If I were writing that I would look into the modulus operator. It gives you the remainder from an integer divide. So 32 mod 10 is 2. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
The reason I want R1 to be the textbox is because R1 represents units and R2 will represent tens and R3 will be hundreds. After the 3 "If"s I will be able to do Totale = R1 + R2 + R3, Totale = txtbxSortie, In theory, It will give me the romain numbers all the way from 1 to 999.
How do I specifically update the text value of the textbox using a string to represent the textbox?
I'm still pretty new to VB, but it seems like Regex may work better for this application
You do know how to step through your code and inspect variables, correct? I think you'll understand what it is doing much better that way. It sounds like your issue is in the code you haven't shared. &amp;#x200B; But your plan is sound, if I understand it correctly. You do have to calculate the three parts individually and then join them together. Remember to use the append operator &amp; and not the addition operator +. &amp;#x200B; First I would treat the input as an integer, not a string. You have TryParse to do the conversion. Let's say we call that variable intInput. And then change your N1, N2, N3 to integers as well. Then N1 would just be intInput Mod 10, N2 would be (intInput Mod 100) - N1, N3 would be (intInput Mod 1000) - N2 - N1. Then you would do a select case to assign R1, then another for R2, then another for R3. Then just join them together txtbxSortie.Text = R3 &amp; R2 &amp; R1. &amp;#x200B;
Open up the whole script editor and check the left side of your screen for other macro files you can store multiple text files as, they may have written more than one, also remember you can use ctrl+F to find “dim” worst case scenario I imagine you can re-define a new variable and just replace all of the old ones.
I will look into the whole script to see if it was stored in multiple there. If I can't find it then I can redefine a new variable, I am just really hoping not to have to do that. Unfortunately, the script does have information in it that precludes me from being able to post it.
Okay, good luck. Hope you get it sorted 
Exactly. My first solution was to use a dummy.txt that I copy to the network and then get the difference between the two LastWriteTime-s, but the times didn't match for each file... I mean to say that the time is not a constant 42 milliseconds or something, it seems to vary for each file.
Interesting. I think i get it. Thank you! I'm backing up my documents (code projects, audio files, nested folders, etc.)
Two solutions, neither of them are pretty, but I promise they will usually the job. First solution is to ignore milliseconds or to ignore a difference smaller than 5 seconds. Obviously if you are editing a file very quickly this may be an issue, the other issue with this is that your computer may be under heavy load and the file may have an insane amount of delay and do the same thing, instances like this should be rare enough that that wouldn’t be an issue however. My second solution is to keep a cache of each file transferred in a text file then note it’s last edit, you can write down the path of each file then put a comma and put the time after the comma, each new line is a new file. Formatting the file like this allows you to change it to a .csv and view it in excel if you like. Once the file is made, you can simply cross reference the times instead of asking the host server. This has a couple advantages, for instance you can store this on the main program that checks time and less Ethernet will have to be used since the file is stored locally. Also disk will be used less since you can load it into a string. You can also avoid someone accidentally editing your backup and causing it to never update.
It just hit me what the problem is when I read your comment. The problem is WriteLine. WriteLine adds a line break that isn't encrypted, so when I attempt to decrypt a non-encrypted character, it messes everything up! Thanks.
i played with this a little and i don't think you are doing something wrong. it is somewhat weird. I found the reason to be the random generator. And it does work with smaller random numbers. i tried it like this and it works: For x As Integer = 0 To encodeThis.Count() - 1 key = rnd.Next(1, 10) ' Convert.ToUInt16(Math.Ceiling(rnd.Next(0, 256))) System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(1) Encoded += Convert.ToChar(key Xor Convert.ToUInt16(encodeThis(x))) Next I just saw i still have some other stuff in there, the key point is the intervall in rnd.next. 0,256 does not work, 1,127 does not work, 1,2 works, 1,10 works. Can you verify that? 
If your using Visual Studio, might I suggest DPack extension, it will backup all your projects easily and you can have multiple project backups in the same folder. https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SergeyM.DPack-16348 Granted, this only useful for your projects, but I find it very useful. If you have any more questions about your backup code, feel free to message me. I'll be more than happy to share some code snippets I have that may make things easier for you.
I had attempted this same thing and had similar results (you want to use 255, not 256 btw).
I've only ever used C#, but I like the idea that there is another language that could potentially solve a different set of problems. What makes VB useful over C#?
Today, basically nothing except possibly XML literals. Over the years C# had adopted most of VB's features such as the ability to access COM libraries and mix statically and dynamically typed code. With each release the advantages for VB over C# declined and now C# has compelling features that are don't expect VB to adopt. 
No problem!
Hey man! Just read the edits, good to hear, I’ll check out the program!

The StrReverse function doesn't work for you?
No we aren’t to use that in this assignment unfortunately :(
set a breakpoint and work from there. line numbers don't always translate in pastes, especially when you don't use proper markup. 
I normally don't give answers to school work but the fact you allowed to use a built in function to accomplish a simple task irritates me to know in. Real wold you would use that function. &amp;#x200B; But for purposes of this 'exercise' he wants you to loop through the string: &amp;#x200B; 1. `Dim lLen As Integer, lCtr As Integer` 2. `Dim sChar As String` 3. `Dim sAns As String` 4. `lLen = Len(Text1.Text)` 5. `For lCtr = lLen To 1 Step -1` 6. `sChar = Mid(Text1.Text, lCtr, 1)` 7. `sAns = sAns &amp; sChar` 8. `Next` 9. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; explanation : * Line 4 you are finding the length of the string * Line 5 start a for loop that goes for the number of characters in the string (this counts down the number of characters) * Line 6 you use the countdown number to collect the character at that position in the string * since it starts at the highest number in the string it will collect the last character first and as the loop progresses it will move to the front of the string, ultimately giving you a reversed string. * Line 7 you assign that character to your answer string * Line 8 will loop &amp;#x200B; So the variable sAns will have your reversed string.
is the file getting created? permission issue? does it already exist and you have it open elsewhere?
no the file was made manually by me by going into the debug folder and creating it, the button that produces the error is supposed to overwrite a specific line in the text file. the button that is named cmdArbed is the button to write to the file, sorry for a hard time because i have to write the names in welsh.
I know you said the error is on the streamwriter line but I think it is on the previous line. I think you haven't initialized your string array, StorioDatas. As near as I can tell, none of the other code assigns it anything. 
You can use the current version of visual studio. Not much had changed. 
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/
I could, but the file saves in a different way and some functions are diferent, and it would be much easier to use the same app.
You can do 2010 VB in the newest version of VS no problem
Same thing.

try form1.txtusername.text in form2
&gt;NameEdit.Namepass = txtusername.Text Do I replace this line?
Nameedit.namepass=form1.txtusername.text
I did it, but an error stating '"txtusername' is not a member of Form 1." popped up. txtusername is located inside Form2. Is there anything I can do to make the above error go away?
It should be form1.lblusername.text since that's how u named it in form one.
I re read your post in short if you want to use any variable from another form just put formname.variable
There are a few ways to do this. But I prefer using a method in the Form2 Class which returns the edited data. So instead of calling Form2.ShowDialog, you are going to call Form2.MyMethod. So in Form2.MyMethod you are going to show the form2. Then you should check the return value. If it was good and they didn't cancel or there was an error or some such, then you return the values. You can use a form2 class level variable to store whether the values were edited and just check that. How you return them is up to you. I'd probably just pass in a form1 class reference to the method and modify the properties directly. Then of course, you need to define the property setters to actually update the textbox. &amp;#x200B; This also solves the other problem of getting the data to Form2. I don't see any code where you are passing the values of form1 to form2 to initialize the textboxes there for editing the values. So now you can do that in Form2.MyMethod right before you call Form2.ShowDialog. You'll have to declare an instance of Form2 first so you can reference it and then use the ShowDialog method on that instance.
What you are doing in the form2 btn_save.click() method, is making two completely new forms. (Dim Nameedit, ageedit as New Form1). That's not really what you want. Just take the new user input and send it back to the labels on Form1. For instance ; Form1.lbusername.Text = txtusername.Text (Where txtusername.Text is the text input on Form2.) 
I can't seem call up Form2.MyMethod, is it something I have to declare?
&gt;Dim NameEdit, ageedit As New Form1 What do I do with this then?
You can just delete those. Unless you WANT 2 new forms with one label on each showing the edited text and name. You already have Form1 (the main form) where you want the labels to be updated, after the user has made the edits on Form2. To update labels on Form1 you reference the labels' text property by Form1.lbusername.Text =txtusername.Text And Form1.lbuserage.Text = txtuserage.Text Then Form1 will be updated and you can discard of form2. 
I think you’re confusing the two terms because they both have visual in them lol
It worked! Oh my goodness, you have no idea how thankful I am! I really appreciate your help!
Cool! Keep at it! 😎👍
Will try my best! Actually, there are other things I have to add to my program. If, after watching tutorials on Youtube, reading Stack Overflow, etc., I still can't get the other functions to work, can I drop you a PM?
Why not 👍
Thanks for the help, I’ll talk to a couple of people about it and try to see how I can fix it.
I see you already got it sorted, but yes, this was a method you would create.
How would I go about that because that's the step I'm missing?
When you declare a variable all you are doing is creating a space in memory, the computer isn’t smart enough to know what you want to do you have to actually assign the values to them accordingly. 
How would I assign them? I'd searched online for awhile but couldnt find that part, or at least didnt realize it if I did.
Okay well have you named the text boxes with the appropriate names? this is very important and should be done before you even start coding. For example a text box for a name should be called something like txtName. Now that you have named it you can use it in the code by accessing it's text property, the text property will have the text that is in the text box, so just make the vaiable equal to whatever is in the text property of the text box. (variable)Name = txtName.txt
You don't need to declare a textbox if you have already created it. What exactly do u need from the textbox? I'm assuming you need the text put in it so you access that by issuing TextBoxName.Text and do whatever u want with it. If TextBoxName.Text = "Hello" Then *do something* End If
If you need integers only, you can convert that by using CInt(TexboxName.Text) or CLng for Long. So if you enter, let's say 32 to the textbox, it will have a string value of "32" and u cant use that for int operations cause it's a string so you use CInt to make it 32. 
1) You have declared 'i' as an Integer and not given it a start value. Fair enough. When you get to your Do Until loop, this kicks in; Do Until i &lt;= 9 This will not run, since 'i' is already less than 9. Try switching the conditional statement to check whether 'i' is equal to or larger than 9... &amp;#x200B; 2) The .Add(................) statement in the For Loop is not correct. Try splitting the statement up into separate parts before adding it to the Itemslist. For instance make a variable for the calculated number, a variable for the String and cocatenate them together, and then add it to the Itemslist vis the Add() method. That way it is easier to see which - if any - step crashes. Trying to do a lot in one go isn't always the best option when learning coding. Keep at it! :) 
Thanks i will keep hacking at it.
Regarding the statement inside the Add() method ; i &amp; " X " &amp; txtNumber.Text &amp; " =" &amp; * CInt(txt Number.Text) gives (1 X 9 = * 9) when you run it. (for i =1). Not quite what you need to get the desired result. But you're almost there! Include the 'i' in the calculation you should be good; i &amp; " X " &amp; txtNumber.Text &amp; " =" &amp; i * CInt(txt Number.Text)
Thanks! That did the trick. I knew it was something little but couldbt figure it out.
I added but still nothing i was reading about For Loops and they discussed Debug.Write(number &amp; " ") is this what i am missing for my code just put my answer in that space
Ok thanks i think i got it down my for loop prints this https://imgur.com/a/hN6fRgx but my do loop doesnt print the products.

Yea, there is going to have to be more info, because we are not going to build it for you. What we generally need is a specific question and the code you are having a problem with.
Do we get the credit in your class for doing your homework then?
Hate to break it to you, but you're not going to like the answer... There isn't a way to convert vb.net into c++. And VB.Net doesn't "use" C#, VB and C# are just both .Net languages. C++ isn't. If you needed a C++ application, you should have built it in C++ from the beginning. 
&gt; There isn't a way to convert vb.net into c++. Well screw me &gt; VB and C# are just both .Net languages. TIL &gt; If you needed a C++ application, you should have built it in C++ from the beginning. My supervisor told me only after I finished my project. Is Visual C++ OK to use? &amp;#x200B;
Visual C++ is just an IDE, right? Yeah, you should be able to use it to write c++
&gt;Visual C++ is just an IDE, right? Yep. Alright, thanks!
Would a converter application like this do the trick? I'm sure there are options when it comes to conversion. https://www.tangiblesoftwaresolutions.com/product_details/vb_to_cplusplus_converter_details.html
Seems interesting. I'll try it out.
I use NetPGPLibrary https://www.nuget.org/packages/NetPGPLibrary 
How is this a VB.NET question?
Invnumber should be a type of string not item. The way you have it defined now you're basically saying invnumber should store another item object. Once you do that, then you can use linq to search by invnumber
Why don't you show us what you have so far. Otherwise, the best I can come up with is id += 1 
I am still on the interface phase.. haven't started coding, but I am forseeing what my challenges would be and trying to get solutions before then.
I would use a Globally Unique IDentifier (GUID) dim g as guid = Guid.NewGuid(); Console.WriteLine(g) 
Would this Authomatically assign a unique serial number to each student?
the reason you can't get the search to work is b/c all the code to search is missing from the search subroutine. 
Well first you need to establish what you will use to save the student data. Are you going to be using a database like SQL? Then you can use the unique ID for each record. OR If you are going to use INI files to store the data (yeah it can be done don't argue with me). You can just increment the ID based on the last ID created. I mean, there are endless possibilities almost. When you're done the interface and you've worked out how you are going to save the data get back to us.
if it's always launched via exe, `Application.StartupPath()` will give that exe's path. for a more sepcific call, `System.IO.Path.GetDirectoryName(System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly.Location())` will work no matter how the program is started.
Alright, will do
Since this is my first class, we haven't covered how to deploy the program yet. We're simply submitting a zip file with the program contents and the professor is opening it by double clicking the solution file or the project file. Is there any way to have the program call on the text file from within the resources folder or something without having to specify an exact path? &amp;#x200B; If not, I can at least try your solution. &amp;#x200B; Thanks for getting back to me so promptly
the resource folder is supposed to be compiling things into the binary, it doesn't exist when deployed, and is a completely different kind of rabbit hole that won't preserve having a text file. if you want to keep the text file, this is what you do to work with paths relative to where your exe file is. I would not put the text file in the resources folder, and if you don't want it in the root path, you should make a new folder for it. you'd then just add that folder to the path you get from the above functions.
So Public InvNumber as String, but then how do I perform the code to search by InvNumber? I am unfamiliar with using arrays and making the loop so that it could have as many inventory items in the code. (Thank you too btw!)
For the search button event handler, do I "txtCost.text = Val(InvNumber.text)" and repeat for the rest?
Thank you very much for your help. This worked perfectly. I was trying to stay true to the material provided by the teacher and the book, but neither of them were able to help me make this program portable in any way. The only other solution was to throw the files into the bin/debug/ path and allow the program to call on the file without specifying the full path. Obviously this is a TERRIBLE work-around since the files will not exist upon deploying the app. But at least it would let the prof use the program by opening up the project file in visual studio
so, one side effect "feature" that I don't recommend relying on but would probably work in your limited use case: simple don't include a path. just use file name alone. the path is then the "current working directory" which for an exe that's double clicked in windows explorer is going to be the path that the exe is in. the drawback of this that there are many ways to change the working directory, both in the code and from outside the code, and not allowing for that is generally a bad idea.
What I would do is move the .txt to the same directory as the .exe. Then use a variable like: Dim path as string = My.Application.Info.DirectoryPath Then change all instances of the the .txt path from: C:/user/desktop/Yachts.txt (or whatever it is) To path &amp; “/Yachts.txt”
as compiler type inference. It is similar to: var viuex = Insert.Substring(Character, 1); In c#.
I may be to green at vb, I was just pointing out when ever I have seen a variable dimmed you need to specify what type of variable it's to be
Google vb list view find selected items
Already tried Google
You will need to update your XML elements and save the XML document. But keep in mind that you can not update the file itself, only just recreate it. 
Do you have to use the xelements? Or can you read the xml file into an object, that would be a lot easier to work with, but since you mentioned it's for homework, I wasn't sure how far along you are, or what your requirements are. Anyways, what you'll want to do is on the successful pin thing, store that Account element as a whole in an object. Then you would manipulate the object, set balance to + or - whatever they do, also checking that they can withdraw the amount they put in. Once you've manipulated that element, you'd then write it back to your original xelement. I can get into more detail but if you can use objects and serialization this becomes way easier. 
What does your code look like right now then?
The .FocusedItem will give you access to all the columns in the currently selected ListViewItem. Example: ListView1.FocusedItem.SubItems(2).Text Would show you the value in the 3rd column of the selected item. ListView1.FocusedItem.Text Will give you the first column of your selected item. 
Take a look at the timer.tick event. That's where you need the text boxes to be filled.
Timers don't stop your program from running. You need to look at the timer.tick event. It fires when your timer hits the interval you defined, and that's where you want to fill your text boxes.
that's not how a timer works. when the timer expires it fires the event and runs that code. you want one timer for your "change all images" event that runs on a short interval (250 maybe?) then another timer that changes a variable to control what columns get updates. for images, the easiest way is to use the ImageList control that's in the MS comom controls 6.0, add it from the Components... dialog. then you can pull pictures from it by index into standard image controls like: set Image1.Picture = ImageList1.ListImages(0).Picture if you REALLY want it to be slot machine like, you'll also want to not generate fully random numbers, but instead loop over the images and stop on random ones. you'd keep 3 variables to track which image index you're on, one for each column, then the top and bottom rows are just that index -1 and +1, which checks to wrap around 0 to 9 and 9 to 0.
Yeah, I can use objects and seriallization 
As I said, you can create variables without specifing type, just like c# with type inference.
So look into xml serialization. Basically you can create an object that mimcs your xml pattern, then you can read the xml file as as string and serialize it into that class. Then you can work with objects and properties, which is a lot easier than xelements. You could then use linq to find the proper account object where the pin matches, update the balance property, and then at the end deserialize the object to a string, and write that back to the xml file. Try copying your xml and going to visual studio, edit, paste special, and see if it'll let you paste xml as class, that will even do the code for you then. Try and get something working and I can help more when you have some code. FYI, post your actual code next time, not images, so people can copy and paste it if they want. If you paste it all, then highlight it, and click the little &lt;&gt; button above the text box, it'll format it as code. 
variable=dgvDatagrid.selectedrows(0).cell("ColumnName").value
Google vb lol through datagrid get column values Or other similar things
Thank you. This is what I needed. Everything I was finding online was about finding it by selecting the row by mouse. :D Thanks
Just a hint for the future, once you start delving into bigger projects it might be useful to stop searching for how to do something in VB, and search for how to do it in C# instead. There’s a much bigger userbase for it and converting the code is relatively simple (use converter.telerik.com) If you break into WPF or UWP, or even program structures like MVVM, the VB.NET support is abysmal. Search in C# and convert, it’ll take you much further :) 
Screenshot’s a new one for me lol 
I wasn’t able to take an actual screenshot since it’s a school computer, I usually take a picture of my code and go home to my own laptop and try to code, haha
Damn that sucks, you can’t email yourself or bring a USB drive with you? 
Damn that sucks, you can’t email yourself or bring a USB drive with you? 
The file would be too big for gmail and I usually forget to bring a USB drive every time. I have a habit of losing them in school though
How big is your project? Especially if you compress it? 25M would be huge for a school assignment. 
Have you gotten to the point where you can loop through it and get all the numbers?
Loop time! Either of the following should work: 1. Dim Total as Integer = 0 For i As Integer = 0 To ListBox1.Items.Count - 1 Total += CUnt(ListBox1.Items(i)) Next 2. Dim Total as Integer = 0 For Each item In ListBox1.Items Total += CInt(item.Value()) Next 
Get Listbox.listcount - run a for loop with a counter (start with 0 end with listcount - 1), then create a dblTotal and add to it itself and the listbox.list(counter) item. This will generate a dblTotal sum.
What do you have so far? A key/value paired dictionary should work, you just set the English as the Key, Spanish as the Value, then when the user inputs the text you check if it equals the Value at that Key. For example (I’m not at the computer so this might not compile but you get the gist) Dim Translations as New Dictionary(Of String, Of String) Translations.Add(“Hello,”Hola” Translations.Add(“Two”, “Dos”) ‘... Check if a users input matches for the dictionary value “Hello” If txtbox_Input.Text.ToLower = Translations(“Hello”).Value Then 'Correct Guess Else 'Incorrect Guess End If
Not sure actually. I don’t usually pay attention to the size, haha. 
If you mean by the text box, yes I was able to loop the text box to get 0-10 using the For Next loop
I will most definitely try both of those! May I ask what the CUnt/CInt means?
Whoops, both are meant to be CInt It’s just a shorthand that attempts to take the input and convert it to an integer. 
My point was imgur links make it really tough for us to help. Having the actual code posted in the comment is preferred. You're probably missing out on other helpers because they simply don't want to try and read a screen shot
Well if you've gotten it to loop and grab all the numbers then it's simply a matter of this (this is pseudo) NumberTotal as int for items in my list box NumberTotal += theNumberInTheLoop end for Console.write "The total is: " &amp; NumberTotal 
Ahhh that makes sense. I’m not entirely sure how to type the code out tbh, still a bit new to posting something
No problem it's why I'm trying to help. If you can post on reddit from school, simply copy and paste the entire text in your screenshot, and then paste it in the comment box when you're asking a question. 
You can see an example here. The poster just pasted his code at the end of his question https://www.reddit.com/r/visualbasic/comments/a3dtzt/button_turning_white_graphics/
Thanks :D
Thanks a lot man ;D
I assume you mean you have a DataTable dt in a DataGridView? If so, you can get specific values of the data table with dt.Rows(2)(1) That will give you the value in row 3, column 2 (remember that these are zero-indexed). If you know the column names, you can also do dt.Rows(2)("ColumnName")
I will do that in the future then! Thank you!
Just about any C# code can be converted to [vb.net](https://vb.net) code. It is just a matter of syntax. You can also put it in a C# class I think and then just call the methods of that class. There are a number of ways of parsing xml. [Here](http://vb.net-informations.com/xml/open-xml-vb.net.htm) are some older ways. The newer way is to use the LINQ library. [Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-to-xml-programming-overview) is the documentation. [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32416474/how-to-read-values-in-xml-file) is an example from stackoverflow. &amp;#x200B; If you have a specific C# example, we could help translate it to [vb.net](https://vb.net) syntax for you. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Thank you very much for the LINQ library links. I will try using LINQ tonight and let you know how it turns out. &amp;#x200B; The C# code I haven't tested yet and had to copy from this youtube example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4aXKPN0nK0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4aXKPN0nK0) `using System.Text;` `using System.Threading.Tasks` `using System.Windows.Forms;` `using System.Xml;` `namespace ReadingXMLFile{` `public partial class Form1 : Form{` `public Form1(){` `InitializeComponent();` `}` `private void searchButton_click(object sender, Eventargs e){` `If(searchInput.Text != null &amp;&amp; searchInput.Text.Length &gt;= 3){` `XmlDocument doc = new XmlDocument();` `doc.Load("Cars.xml");` `foreach(XmlNode node in doc.DocumentElement){` `string name = node.Attributes[0].InnerText;` `if(name == searchInput.Text){` `foreach(XmlNode child in node.ChildNodes){` `searchResults.Items.Add(child.InnerText);` `}` `}` `}` `}` `else{` [`MessageBox.Show`](https://MessageBox.Show)`("Invalid Input");` `searchInput.Text = string.Empty;` `searchInput.Focus();` `}` `}` `}` `}` &amp;#x200B; I've tried using an online converter, but it seemed to snag on something and wouldn't come back with anything. Can you place this c# code into a module? I understand you can use modules to hold functions you can call in event handlers. I'm just not sure if you can use C# code instead of VB. 
You can make a c# project that produces a DLL and then include a reference to the DLL that generates into a VB.Net project. Then just call the public function from that DLL in VB. OR convert this code from C# to VB.Net line by line yourself instead of using a converter (if it's breaking) I would just convert the code by hand to VB, nothing here looks like it shouldn't convert just rewrite it in VB and you should be good to go.
http://converter.telerik.com/ is the best tool to go from c# to vb I think. Just paste in the code and it'll give you the vb code. I use it fairly often because it's easier to find c# solutions, and translating it takes longer than copy/pasting it into here.
 If Not System.String.IsNullOrEmpty(searchInput.Text) AndAlso searchInput.Text.Length &gt;= 3 Then Dim objDoc As System.XML.XMLDocument = New System.XML.XMLDocument() objDoc.Load("Cars.xml") For Each objNode As System.XML.XMLNode In objDoc.DocumentElement Dim strNodeName As System.String = objNode.Attributes.Item(0).InnerText If strNodeName = searchInput.Text Then For Each objChildNode As System.XML.XMLNode In objNode.ChildNodes searchResults.Items.Add(objChildNode.InnerText) Next objChildNode End If Next objNode Else MessageBox.Show("Invalid Input") searchInput.Text = System.String.Empty searchInput.Focus() End If Here is the translation, done by hand and not checked for correctness so be forewarned. I also use the fully qualified declarations, which is my normal practice but some people prefer the short ones. &amp;#x200B; So this method uses the System.XML.XMLDocument which loads the xml into memory. This method has a notorious issue with large XML files. So if you are expecting large ones, I would not use this method. For large XML files, you need something that reads them without pulling the whole file into memory. How large is large? That depends on the system. But if you have files of a hundred MB or more, I'd consider other options. &amp;#x200B;
It's called a variable. Variables come in different data types: int, date, string, etc. You can add values/variables together: &amp;#x200B; Dim i as integer = 1 Dim x as integer = 2 dim total as integer &amp;#x200B; total = i + x
You need to use variables Here's a short example: ''' Dim num_one as Integer = 10 Dim num_two as Integer = 20 Dim answer as Integer answer = num_one + num_two MessageBox.Show(answer) '''
the directory functions read in directory order, which has to do with a combination of when the files were created and when other files were deleted before that. if you need a specific sort, be it name, created or modified date, or whatever, you have to do it.
There is no guarantee in which order files are returned, it depends on the whims of the file system. I believe NTFS usually orders them roughly alphabetically for technical reasons while others commonly order them by last write time, but that isn't guaranteed either. If you want to list files in a specific order, then order them yourself, e.g. by file creation or modification date.
I'd like to thank you for your help, the LINQ method was just what I was looking for and I was able to retrieve data using this code Imports System Imports System.IO Imports System.Xml Imports System.Linq Imports System.Collections.Generic Public Class notmainpage Private Sub btn_display_path_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btn_display_path.Click Dim xml = XDocument.Load("C:\Test_folder\settings_xml.ltp") Dim this_thing = (xml.&lt;FileLocations&gt;.&lt;DailyTasksXMLlocation&gt;.&lt;FileName&gt;.Value).ToString lbl_display_path_here.Text = this_thing 'Dim dsubject = ( 'From e In xml.&lt;FileLocations&gt;.&lt;DailyTasksXMLlocation&gt;. 'Where e.&lt;key&gt;.Value = "DSUBJECT" 'Select Case e.&lt;value&gt;.Value ').Single() End Sub End Class I am using my own file extension .ltp for holding xmls. I only have on question though. In the example provided on stack overflow, I am not sure what 'e' is supposed to be. From, Where, and Select Case and 'e' I have no idea what they do. 
The files aren't stored alphabetically, your os outs displaying them that way for you. You want to do this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32435921/select-files-from-directory-order-of-there-names
I always suggest that you make something that YOU will use. That way you have an incentive to continue to work on it
Very true. But to be honest I cant think of anything at the moment XD. Which is the problem I'm currently having lol. 
Understandable: Look at the activities you do all the time, in cases when you do multiple things; ie: Start your machine, open a browser, start music. These are patterns that can be programmed. Learning to find that patterns, and find solutions is also part of the development cycle. So taking a little time here to think of something will be good for you as well. (I know, not what you WANT to hear...) Also learning to make a specification, a list of what you want the program to do is important. I know, just want you needed, MORE homework. Sorry, but please believe me. I have been a developer for 20+ years and these steps are important too
Thank you this actually helps quite a bit I appreciate it. I'll have to think of what I do in a day that could be easily programmed into something. I'm not sure I've ever stopped to think about that. 
I know it can be a pain, but I'd rather push you a little for something YOU want, it really does help to drive a person to complete a project. I am currently working on a VR game, I have never written a game before and only a bit of VR work. But since I want to have the game, it pushes me forward.
Do you have a job? My first projects were based on making parts of my job easier or re-creating something I already use because I know how it works already. 
So what is it you’re trying to do? Just load data from the text file? Where is it going wrong?
I really want to work my way up to some unity stuff to make a game too! Good luck on your project man! Thank you again. 
The good news then is that once you get used to VB, migrating to C# will not be too difficult (Source: I did VB work for 20 years, starting with VB 2.0) Unity's language is C#, so what you are learning now, the ideas, concepts, the IDE, etc will all make it easier for you to learn Unity.
It is only getting the first entry and last entries of the text file to load into the list box and I get the system exception I commented right above the catch statements. Which if I understand slightly, means that it is trying to pass an empty element into the list. Right? If that is the case, I don't know where I am messing up. 
A good starting app could be a temperature converter - an application that can convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.
Haven't tried Unity and I didn't know C# was its base. Can I ask? How close or different is it compared to coding c# in visual studio? 
You can actually code Unity in Visual Studio. It is very intuitive and fun. Download the free version of Unity and give it a go. They have great samples with videos to help get you started.
As stated by zulelord you can code Unity in VS, yay!, so there is no differences in the IDE. There are some minor differences since Unity uses Mono (last I checked, DEFINITIVELY take a look before you begin) so there can be some items/features not available. But all in all, it's the same exact usage.
Make sure you follow MVVM. 
May I ask How close are the two languages? 
Yes I currently work in desktop support actually
That's good. Create a program to help you log activities or something like that. A user interface that is simple but accepts user input, time stamps, writes to a database or excel file. Then add a report button that outputs to a text file or print the report from there. 
It is not that the languages are similar, it's a collection of items that make the transition easier * Once you learn the patterns of one language, ie: loops, objects, etc, then learning those differences are as simple as this: http://converter.telerik.com/ * The .net frameworks that you have used will also be available. The only difference would be the declaration of the variable. (see below for example) * You're using the same IDE, and that too saves you some time from learning new UI and the tools In VB: Dim userName As String = "James" Debug.WriteLine(userName.Length) In C#: string userName = "James"; Debug.WriteLine(userName.Length); As you can see, once the variable is declared, the use of that object's methods and properties is exactly the same. There are some differences in the language, such as SWITCH instead of SELECT CASE, the IF statement does not have an END IF, and various things like that. Very minor. Sites like stated above will allow you to create your code in VB and then convert it. Once you get used to it, you'll be able to change your mindset to C#. What's nice is that C languages are all very similar, so learning JavaScript, C++, etc will be easier. Also it's important to know the source of what you are reading, meaning ME, maybe I dont know as much as I think I do or... well, so many things. You can check my portfolio site at Blissgig.com for the projects have worked on, this way you can see if I have a f'in clue.
First and foremost, display your exception messages. Right now you are hiding the actual error by just displaying a messagebox of the type of exception. ... Catch Exception As SystemException MsgBox(Exception.ToString) ' Or MsgBox (Exception.Message) Do this for each catch and then run the code. You will then see that you are getting an ArgumentNullException on MainArray. 
THANK YOU! This is definitely going to get me on my way. I can't thank you enough
Oh.
what is the error you get and what is the declaration of your feature class look like. Also, it really helps if you can format your code when you post. Highlight your code and use the little &lt;&gt; button to format it so it's readable. 
Lol thank you so much this is amazing information! I thoroughly appreciate your time on this. I really would like to become a programmer. I have a vast array of hardware knowlege but just stepping my foot in software. Knowing all this makes it seem a little bit easier learning all this. 
Sorry to ask but what is that? 
Me being slightly facetious but it's actually not a bad idea if you're at that level in your learning. It stands for Model, View, ViewModel. It separates data, data interpretation, and what you see. https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/100175/%2fArticles%2f100175%2fModel-View-ViewModel-MVVM-Explained
You are most welcome. Your hardware knowledge will give you a bit of an edge. The more you know about the tech that surrounds, the better you can adapt your applications to the needs. Remember than when you feel overwhelmed, and you will, that: 1) Walk away for a minute/hour/day. Give yourself a break. 2) We all felt, and still feel, that we are missing some info, some abilities. All of this tech is very new. 3) Enjoy yourself. You get to create things, and that's cool too. 
I greatly appreciate that thank you!
Can you show the other classes? More specifically how you are defining the Geometry object? I tried to work backward from your schema but I'm not very fluent with JSON and came up with the following result from my "assumed" class schema of the objects involved. { "success": true, "type": "FeatureCollection", "features": { "type": "Feature", "properties": { "DLSSHORT": "2-2-2-W4", "QUARTER": "", "SECTION": "2", "TOWNSHIP": "2", "RANGE": "2", "MERIDIAN": "W4", "PROVINCE": "Alberta", "COUNTY": "CypressCounty", "LATITUDE": 49.09364, "LONGITUDE": -110.173042, "ZOOM": 14, "MGRS": "12UWV6037138194", "UTM": "12N5603725438195", "NTS": "B-14-G/72-E-1", "PID": "402002020" }, "geometry": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ -110.162055, 49.0864 ], [ -110.162039, 49.100866 ], [ -110.184014, 49.100879 ], [ -110.184063, 49.08641 ], [ -110.162055, 49.0864 ] ] ] } } } With the schema I produced, I was able to compare my inputs with what you had and the difference I found was that the [ before Features and the ] between the }'s at the end. I removed these two square brackets and was able to deserialize the JSON. Again, not sure what I did different so seeing the Feature, Properties and Geometry classes might help.
Can't you just do two independent tables and set the visibility on them based on whatever button you mentioned determines which one shows?
wouldn't you just join? to save back, you have generate the separate update statements as needed
How do you want to split the display of each table? You could use a joined query and create update logic based on which columns changed. You could create an updatable view which just shifts the logic to your database as well. If you want something that does a master-detail view, it would be easier with a second gridview. I don’t think you can set the ItemSource to 2 different object collections at the same time, but you might be able to swap them back and forth. I’ve not really played with that concept too much. Are you using a data framework or other ORM (like Entity Framework or Dapper) or are you using straight data object libraries (like system.data.SQLClient or ..OleDb)? The former uses POCOs to represent your data, while in the later, I’ve used straight DataTable objects with dataGrids. In short, I need to see both more of your code and more details of how you want this to function.
I basically just used the drag and drop function. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/hLmCeTK) is a Picture of my Program and a my Dataset. When the User clicks on an item in the list (Datagridview) on the right site, the Textboxes update automatically and specific to that Hotel. This needs to happen with my Sightseeing Datagridview too. Thanks for your help!
And i just need the Sightseeing Names and Distances in one DGV.
Thanks for sharing. That's pretty cool.
sweet
This is totally impressive, how long did it take you to create this (including whatever research was required)? It looks like a monumental task.
It looks like you want something that will display a second column when you click on a row. I would write a SQL table function to do this. Don’t bind your tables to the grid. You should be able to change the itemSorce or DataSorce* properties of the grid in code. You then need to find the double click event of your grid and use a column of the selected row as a parameter to your function. Then clear the grid and set the results of the new function to your grid via that property. You might be able to use LINQ but that requires that all your results are in another table already. I imagine it would be more efficient to compute these distances. I don’t have access to my code right now, so all I can give you is the basics. *Syntax varies between winfirm and WPF
And if i made 2 Tables, i just need to tell the Datagridview that the Hotel\_ID is in "this" Textbox. Because i want the Sightseeing items from that Hotel, not the whole list. Wouldnt that be possible?
Yeah, that should be possible. 
Do you know how? :D
you implement a sort function. exactly how you do that depends on what VB version you're using
Have you tried Array.Sort(countries) / Array.Sort(populations)?
Any reason you can't just add the image to the main form and show/hide when appropriate?
I just borrowed a VB6 book from the library yesterday. Because I'm a masochist. So your project makes me smile. 
What you are asking to do import: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2036229/vb-net-2008-importing-forms-from-another-project](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2036229/vb-net-2008-importing-forms-from-another-project)
impressive
I'm not a big fan of VB6 but this is very impressive. Now I want to see a QB version of it. 
Thanks. It took many months of work. I wrote it in C first, then did a stripped down port to VB6 for "fun". The VB6 port only took a couple of weeks to get right.
Have fun, be prepared for a shock if you're used to newer IDEs!
Thanks. I already did a QB port. Yes, really! It's as terrible as you'd expect, too!
In this case instead of me.myDataGrid.SelectedItem.&lt;whatever the syntax is to get value from specific column&gt;, you would use me.myTextBox.text. I am using made up names for the controls obviously. 
In addition to the previous answers which mentioned [Array.Sort](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.array.sort?view=netframework-4.7.2#System_Array_Sort_System_Array_), here is some [information](https://www.dotnetperls.com/sort-vbnet). Depending on your situation, it may be easier to use one of the sorted lists from the [generics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/collections/when-to-use-generic-collections). &amp;#x200B; So ascending alphabetical sort or numeric sort is built-in and if you have a list or array, you can just call the sort method. To do a reverse sort, you specify your own comparison interface to the sort function. Or you go the lazy way and sort it ascending and then reverse the whole list, which wastes both time and memory.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.math.round
Does Round(x,0) not work?
Math.Round(number, decimal places) if you have the math class
You could use Cint instead of Int.
Or just Application.round(number,1) Don't use the vba implementation or round as it does account rounding. 
Math.Floor(i + 0.5)
Pretty new with vb and i happen to stumble to this, how can it be disabled?
There's a lot of code there. Are you just trying to get the index of the selected item? cboEmployee.SelectedIndex will give you the index number. Keep in mind that it's zero-based, so the first item is actually index 0 and not 1.
Well you fixed the issue that I've been staring at all day. I used cbo.Employee.SelectedIndex and everything loaded correctly. Why professor's ask students to use code that was never taught by said professor will always be frustrating. Thank you for the quick and awesome help!
Glad to help!
Look into string.contains() meathod
Thanks :)
How exactly would I insert it into the form?
How is it checking for a password? At password generation, like when you sign up for a website and it asks you for a strong password? 
Exactly!
Perhaps on a timer event?
How....What? All i need it to do if check if each of the requirements is met for what the user inputs, once they press the button.
Then do it on that. Do you know if then statements?
Yep!
Not sure how implement specific values (uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, etc.)
Where string is the input password, You could use a for loop to check if each character of the string is one of your required values. From there you can use flags to check if it contains one of those values. E.g. I made one of these in python a while ago, but this is a basic translation: Dim CapsFlag as Boolean = False For each value in string: If asc(value) &lt; [ascii value for Z] and asc(value) &gt; [ascii value for z] CapsFlag = true End if End for Don’t copy paste it, it won’t work, but what happens is that it takes each character in the string and checks if it is within the ascii values of the capital letters, the same can be done for Lower case and symbols.
Regular expressions are the best way for testing password validity. See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19605150/regex-for-password-must-contain-at-least-eight-characters-at-least-one-number-a 
I saw this and since the matter is only day or two old, I thought I'd respond. &amp;#x200B; The short answer is if Math.Round(number,decimal precision) doesn't work for you, then most likely Microsoft's idea of rounding is different from yours or else you are entering a type of number that is different from the one you would truly intend to use for your outcome. &amp;#x200B; It seems to be Visual Basic 6 about which you're asking, but all of this ought to apply to newer versions as well. &amp;#x200B; There is a basic Windows API for rounding and this is what the math.round is calling: &amp;#x200B; This is for double type: Private Declare Sub VarR8Round Lib "oleaut32" (ByVal dblIn As Double, ByVal cDecimals As Long, ByRef pdblResult As Double) double take up 8 bytes of memory &amp;#x200B; This is for any number - I haven't experimented, by it would presumably take a string that has a numeric value and work - even a set of bytes (ideally 4 or 8 bytes) - don't know what it would do with 16 bytes or something else Private Declare Sub VarRound Lib "oleaut32" (ByRef pvarIn As Variant, ByVal cDecimals As Long, ByRef pvarResult As Variant) This is probably what Visual Basic 6 actually uses for the round function. It would be slower than the double type simply because computations on variants generally take longer than other computations for numbers. It wouldn't matter for one or ten or one-hundred computations, but if you rounded 10,000 numbers, there would be a slight difference in speed for the results. &amp;#x200B; You don't need to use the API functions, but they are sometimes quicker. API function, application program interface, are functions supplied by microsoft, by the operating system. &amp;#x200B; Presumably the number you're rounding is a real/floating number, either a single or a double (Visual Basic also has Decimal type and a Currency Type - Currency is actually an integer that is 8 bytes but internally has 4 places of decimal precision so it looks like a decimal). And I'm assuming you precisely mean that you want to round off to the nearest integer. &amp;#x200B; If you are starting off, before rounding, with variables that are integer, long or currency, then there is some rounding off that has already begun, which certainly would affect any rounding. If you start off with a Variant or String variable, you would get different results too, but I'm assuming you are not doing so. &amp;#x200B; You will get different results with different variable declarations between Single and Double. So it matters if you start off rounding a single versus a double: &amp;#x200B; Dim TestSingle As Single Dim TestDouble As Double &amp;#x200B; TestSingle = 1.499999999 TestSingle = TestSingle + TestSingle 'total already equals 3 before any rounding takes place &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; TestDouble = 1.499999999 TestDouble = TestDouble + TestDouble 'total still is correct at 2.99 .... &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Internally for all decimal values if it has enough places, computers do some rounding, but in this example you will see that there is greater automatic rounding for singles than for doubles (currency and decimal type would also be subject to this rounding effect). &amp;#x200B; There are also some numbers that can't be fully expressed even though you enter them and it appears that they are properly entered: &amp;#x200B; TestSingle = 9.95 &amp;#x200B; TestDouble = Round(TestSingle, 1) &amp;#x200B; This is supposed to round to the first decimal position, but it rounds to 9.8999...(a much longer decimal series). This is not the norm and just has to do with .95 value. I'd rather skip a longer explanation and say it is not anything wrong with Visual Basic and instead how decimal numbers are stored. &amp;#x200B; How you write the declaration of variable matters too. If you put two or more variable on a single line as so: &amp;#x200B; Dim Variable1, Variable2 As Single &amp;#x200B; Variable1 is being declared as a Variant Variable2 is being declared as a Single &amp;#x200B; Dim Variable1 as Single, Variable2 As Single Variable1 is being declared as a Single Variable2 is being declared as a Single &amp;#x200B; This could have altered what you were entering, if you created two or more variables ona single line without specifically declaring the type for each. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Windows Rounding considers .5 or higher to be rounded up for positive numbers however for negative numbers it rounds .5 down to the lower number. I mean if you have -1.5, windows rounds -1.5 down to -2 and -2 is a smaller value compared to -1. So that could be considered an inconsistency if not wrong. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Numbers themselves - not just variable - can be declared as single or double. &amp;#x200B; By default, any number with a decimal value is considered a double. &amp;#x200B; However you can declared a number as a single: &amp;#x200B; 9.95 'double value, the default 9.95# 'also a double value - the # will disappear in visual basic if you enter it 9.95! 'a single value 9.95@ 'a currency value &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; So if you run these two examples, you get different results: &amp;#x200B; TestDouble = Round( 9.95!, 1) 'produces 9.8999 ...(a much longer decimal series) &amp;#x200B; TestDouble = Round( 9.95, 1) 'produces 10 &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; In this case, when rounding to the first decimal place, it should be note that what Windows does isn't necessarily what people would always do if they were asked to round. I may look at 9.95 and if asked to round to the tenth decimal place, I'd say it was 9.9. But windows as in the second example round up to 10 even though it was instructed to round to the tenth. It evaluated the number and look at .005 and rounded that up, which caused .9 to get rounded up, which cause 9 to get rounded up to 10. There is a consistency to that, just not what I believe most people would do. Windows rounds up by looking at each individual digit, whereas at least some people would look at the entire number (or rather from the integer down, not from each smallest decimal place going to increasing values). &amp;#x200B; If you want something different than this, you may wish to create your own small function, something that truncates decimal values if the number of decimal places exceeds tenths and something that corrects negative numbers being rounded the wrong way. &amp;#x200B; Just for your information, numbers are able to be defined as different types using these suffixes: &amp;#x200B; Currency @ as in 47,442,444,044@ Double # 457# or any number can be defined this way Integer % 45% Long &amp; 0&amp; or &amp;HFF&amp; Single ! 354.4! &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
You're in the wrong subreddit for help with Google sheets, as they use a javascript language they call google apps script. The right subreddit appears to be [https://www.reddit.com/r/googleappsscript](https://www.reddit.com/r/googleappsscript).
Thank you!
You need the Jet Runtimes installed. As with most error messages you receive, putting your title into Google will be very helpful in showing you a resolution.
Yes, thank you, but i worry that it would not work with 64 bit. But i have another pc on 32 bit maybe i should try it out there.
Did you build this for the Discord stuff you are working on?
Nah. My friends were testing some CS:GO hacks and their injector didn't work every time so I started to make my own and I sent it to them and it works like a charm.
You need a .gitignore Then add your obj bin and other non essential files to it.
Does he add them with Notepad, I ask because I have no idea either.
He can it's just a text file that git reads and then just ignores the files listed in it.
make sure TargetRow is a sane value.
This is too vague. We're not here to do your homework. Seemingly all you have to do is put clickable text on a screen right? So start by looking that up.
what do you mean by a sane value? TargetRow can be equal to anywhere from 1-100 in this code. &amp;#x200B;
What are you building this in winforms?
and if something goes wrong and it's empty string?
This is my code [http://prntscr.com/lx7k73](http://prntscr.com/lx7k73) i just i want to make it display instructions to the user at the beginning, i dont know how..
&gt;and if something goes wrong an not sure what you are trying to say. 
Can't you just show/hide a panel with the instructions?
the error is a generic "something isn't as expected", so validate all your values and make sure they are as expected before using them or calling methods on them.
I believe all of my values are declared correctly it's that when trying to enter a time value for Now is seems to be the issue.
https://i.imgur.com/PMHSVtw.jpg Sorry for the image quality. This is where I'm stuck. It says property size is read only
From the looks of the code... add additional console.writelines with the instructions just after the try command. 
[Take a look at the bottom of this page, under the Button1\_Click event,](http://www.java2s.com/Code/VB/GUI/ChangeButtonFontatRuntime.htm) you can see that a new FONT object is created and assigned to the button. Notice in the example it doesn't set the button's font, it sets the ME object's font. So change that line to your button
Thanks for the help! I got it working the way I wanted. I ended up where you hold enter and the form gets huge, then when it fills your screen it shrinks, and goes in a loop like that. Kept me entertained for at least 5 minutes.
Are you a new student? This is the easiest thing ever. Separate all different aspects of your code into functions. Main program brings up the menu with options. Option 1 calls function 1 Option 2 calls function 2 Option 3 calls function 3 etc etc Each function does something different. P.S. What do you have against copy &amp; paste? Why the screen shots of code?
I might be able to help you if this is still an issue. I wont bother if you have solved it though.
Did it anyway haha. Its a bit clunky but it seems to work. This should be good for 9 of the same instances in cell b2 but if you need more just add lines (see below) Hope it works out for you! Sub sheetname() Dim SheetMyVar As Worksheet For Each Sht In Worksheets i = i + 1 If Sht.codename Like "Sheet" &amp; i Then Set SheetMyVar = Sht Sht.Select On Error GoTo Handle nameof = Range("B2") ActiveSheet.Name = nameof goaround: If Err.Number &gt;= 0 Then Err.Clear End If End If Next Sht Exit Sub Handle: If Err.Number &gt;= 0 Then Err.Clear End If Resume that that: On Error Resume Next 'Add line here if you need more than 9 instances ActiveSheet.Name = nameof &amp; " 9" ActiveSheet.Name = nameof &amp; " 8" ActiveSheet.Name = nameof &amp; " 7" ActiveSheet.Name = nameof &amp; " 6" ActiveSheet.Name = nameof &amp; " 5" ActiveSheet.Name = nameof &amp; " 4" ActiveSheet.Name = nameof &amp; " 3" ActiveSheet.Name = nameof &amp; " 2" Resume this this: GoTo goaround End Sub 
Thanks so much! Tonight I'll try it and let you know!
No worries. if you have no luck, you can email your sheet to me for me to have a play with if you want. Im just learning myself and quite enjoy solving these issues. 
Would you like me to cook you dinner too? You just listed off a massive amount of work with 0 effort of actually trying to do it. You're not likely to get much help with a list like that. Break your problem down into individual tasks and start researching, we'll help but we're not going to du the work for you
You sounds like a physics teacher. It might be a massive work for you but I’m sure it’s peanuts for experts.

lol k
Can you post an example of your excel file? And then what are you exactly trying to do? Not exactly sure what uploading to a v20 api platform means. Like it's a service that has an API you're trying to send data to?
Yes , I am uploading once a week trading signals on my blog statsfx.wordpress.com . Then I open the limit orders manually every week on my oanda account . What I am trying to do is: 1) Do the weekly update with a macro for that I need to download (copy and paste) weekly high and lows for each pair to my excel ss. That calculate the buy or sell opportunities.( signals) 2)Go to my trading platform and upload the limit orders generated with the weekly update The stop los and takeprofit levels are allready setup by default Hope is clear enough to start
Not really, keep in mind I have 0 context so words that seem every day normal to you, I may not even know. So right now is your process that you have an excel file that you are manually uploading to your wordpress site? Or do you mean you're opening your excel file and copy and pasting the values onto your website? 
if you want something performant, robust, and reliable, don't use macros, use a real program. you can use vb.net to read excel files, and I'm sure there's .net examples or libraries for whatever API you can find. most examples are likely to be in C#, but it's not all that different.
What a dick
Thank you , I agree on the robust part of the allready working on python to make a more sofisticated elegant algo , in the meantime with the Visualbasic was an awesome evolution tu speed up many tedious updating work . Thanks so much again Take care
You aren't adding up the points anywhere. Make a variable, call it say total_points, set it to 0 after the points has been calculated add the points to total points. out side of the loop print out the total points. Make sure you define total points outside of the loop.
The purpose is to display the total points for each player. Since the points value changes for each line, wouldn’t total_points be unnecessary?
Ha yes you are right. Since it's your project. lol. So to clarify then, you want to take the points (which you calculate) and add it back into the array?
Exactly. I’m having difficulty doing so as I’m pretty new to the game. Is there any way this could be done without being overly complex?
Do you want to write the data back into the text file? Assuming this is what you want to do, make another file, maybe called results.txt with IOStreamWriter. Take the data you got from the IOStreamReader and then add your added data to the end of it for each line. Then add that newly created line to the IOStreamWriter. That should work.
 I played around with the code and took a completely different approach but when I entered this nothing is outputted. I feel as I’m pretty close. Any ideas as to where I fucked up? ‘Declare variables Dim hockeyFile, LineOfText, aryTextFile() As String Dim i As Integer Dim nameText(), NumberText(), goalsText(), assistsText(), GamesWonText() As String Dim IntAssists(), IntGoals(), PointsText() As Single hockeyFile = "C:\Users\Bob\Downloads\hockey.txt" 'state location of file Dim objReader As New System.IO.StreamReader(hockeyFile) 'objReader can read hockeyFile For i = 0 To objReader.Peek() &lt;&gt; -1 'reads each line seperately, ends when there is no more data to read LineOfText = objReader.ReadLine 'stores seperate lines of data in HockeyFile into LineofText aryTextFile = LineOfText.Split(",") 'takes lines and converts data into array Name = aryTextFile(0) 'first piece of data in lines of text is the name nameText(i) = aryTextFile(0) If nameText(0) = "Name" Then TextBox1.Text = LineOfText &amp; ", Points." &amp; vbCrLf 'displays first line fo text and adds "Points" label End If If Name &lt;&gt; "Name" Then 'when second line starts, then begin to intepret data NumberText(i) = aryTextFile(1) assistsText(i) = aryTextFile(2) 'assists are in third value of array goalsText(i) = aryTextFile(3) 'goals are in fourth value of array GamesWonText(i) = aryTextFile(4) IntAssists(i) = Val(assistsText(i)) 'since our assists value is a string by default, it must be converted to a integer IntGoals(i) = Val(goalsText(i)) 'since our goals value is a string by default, it must be converted to a integer PointsText(i) = (IntGoals(i) * 2) + (IntAssists(i)) 'goals are two points, assists are one point TextBox1.Text = TextBox1.Text &amp; NumberText(i) &amp; assistsText(i) &amp; goalsText(i) &amp; GamesWonText(i) &amp; PointsText(i) &amp; vbCrLf 'Displays points as last value in each line End If Next i 
Should aryTextFile = LineOfText.Split(",") 'takes lines and converts data into array be aryTextFile() = LineOfText.Split(",") 'takes lines and converts data into array? I can't remember if that's right. If it is right, then why not print out the datat as it comes in and make sure it's coming in properly.
Using StreamReaders/Writers is a very archaic way of doing things. You should just do something like Dim fileContents() as String = File.ReadallText(filename).Trim.Split(vbcrlf), and then just do a for i = 0 to fileContents.Length - 1.
The assignment I’m doing requires the usage of StreamReader/Writer
Seems dumb that they would require you to learn an out-dated mechanic that is not only pointless, but way slower.
Yea seems to be making life difficult. Is there any way I could store points as the 6th value in aryTextFile using easy to understand/minimalistic code? 
Note quite understanding what you want to do here. Can you give an example of what the hockey.txt file looks like, and then what data you want stored in an array? No matter how the data is shown, you basically want to do this: ` Dim hockeyfileSplit() as string = File.ReadAllText("C:\Users\Bob\Downloads\hockey.txt").Trim.Split(vbCrlf) Dim hockeyStats(hockeyfileSplit.Length) as String For i = 0 to hockeyfileSplit.Length - 1 If hockeyfileSplit(i) = "Name" Then hockeyStats(i) = hockeyfileSplit(0) &amp; "," &amp; hockeyfileSplit(1) ' First line is going to be the heading 'Name' and 'Points' Else hockeyStats(i) = hockeyfileSplit(0) &amp; "," &amp; CInt(hockeyfileSplit(1) + (CInt(hockeyfileSplit(2)) * 2)) End If Next`
What does the data in hockey.txt look like, and what do you want the ending output to be that is stored in an array?

Basically, in hockey.txt, the first row is Name, Number, Assists, Goals, Games Won. Underneath, theres actually data in the same format (substitute numbers for numeric values) for each player. The objective of the program is to use StreamReader/Writer and arrays to add an extra column with Points and the subsequent points for each player. Each goal is 2 points, each assist is 1

So you want a program that takes keyboard/mouse input and converts it to the train controls? Or.... what, exactly?
the otherway around actually :D i want the traincontrol levers to be joystick axis (fine if those are virtual, but more awesome if it would be in a driver style available in windows controlpanel) then the 2x 3point rotary switches are actually the same just a joystick-potientiometer with 3 fixed values... the buttons are only ON/OFF (so no presure or velocity like USB-Midi for example) could you help? anything else you need to know, I'll do my best!
My kingdom for a TLDR; Can you give me one sentence for the goal for your project, I am having a hard time deriving what you are looking for. My guess is that you want to emulate a DCC controller with your PC using the raildriver as your interface. User Story: You want to use your raildriver a controller for the trainsimulator game with your model trains via a DCC interface. So your signal comes in from the Raildriver, the signal is changed to what it needs to go out over a usb to dcc interface so your engines that have the dcc electronics etc. etc. will work from the raildriver controller. How close did i get? 
How did you actually do this in vb? Like, can this thing run an operating system or execute binaries? How did you do all that in vb?
Yes to both. It emulates a whole early 80's PC environment. Basically, there is a 1 MB byte array to simulate the 8086's memory space. It loads a PC BIOS into the proper part of memory, same place it would be on a real PC. It begins interpreting instructions in memory the same way the real CPU does, except it uses equivalent VB6 code to perform the tasks the real CPU would. There are variables to act as the 8086 CPU registers. It can boot DOS, MINIX 2, etc. unmodified. The operating systems don't know that they're not working on a "real" computer. It gets a lot more complicated than that, but that's the basic (pun intended, ha ha ha I'm sorry) overview.
that's insane man. props.
yeah sorry I need to learn and include a TLDR version, it seems most of my question will never get read or understand... which is why is often get no response at all :D thnx for the tip/input! Secondly thanks for even going further doing some research and still offering help for a follow up... i will get into more details in my next response BRB
OK lets start by saying Digitrax sounds awesome, sadly if this even works I want to bring it to friends and on club events etc. there we all use 'z21' white version (which only supports Xpressnet, the black Z21 has an extra Loconet support) so who knows what I want might not even possible, now onto your questions! (see next response)
yes i would very much like to use my small/thin/lightweight Wifi Notebook Asus Optimus as an emulated DCC controller, how this software/interface gets it's input would be welcome in 2ways: 1.have all commands available via Keyboard/Mouse/Joystick (so that I can also map my FlightControlSticks Saitek X45 &amp; X52 and my USB-Midi panels) this would render the default Z21 Maintenance Software which I now use obsolete (since it's very limited only let's me control Forward/Reverse/SpeedUP/DOWN/Function0-9 and 1train simultaneously) 2.input directly from the USB Raildriver converted and then send via laptop through wifi towards my z21 DCC commandstation
As we speak I'm downloading the package following a link in the EDIT link you posted to find out it that software: https://freshcode.club/projects/modelrailroadsystem can do what I what :) I'll keep you posted!
UPDATE: I actually tried to connect the RAILDRIVER via JMRI (java) to the z21 and it actually lets me control the train, but it super duper slow to a point it will 100% crash my trains plus they have abandoned the project and only have the Forward/Reverse Lever and the Throttle lever activated :( so 2+3 axis still unused and the 2axis from the 3point rotary switches also don't work! So I guess with my motivation and hopefully your help, people would finally have a decent and quick responding solution :)
What you are looking for is the MaskTextBox: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.maskedtextbox.mask?view=netframework-4.7.2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.maskedtextbox.mask?view=netframework-4.7.2)

Can't you just set the ReadOnly property?
You should be able to adapt their Unity implementation without too much trouble.
I compiled and used this in my vb application https://github.com/Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp it was written to expose the richard presence layer in unity
Change the variable type from Integer (16 bit) to Long (32 bit)
How big is the number?
As someone else mentioned, it's probably an int16 over flow issue. However, if you need it to stay int, do int32. I got burnt by this in my early years. I'll do int16 because it uses less memory (because memory is sooooo expensive these days). Yea, that worked until my tables got big enough that the PKs overflowed int16. Live and learn. 
Make sure you're not dividing by zero by mistake
I didn’t
Is there any way to store an indefinitely long number? I know Long will let it store more data but it will still run out because the numbers in the game I’m making increase exponentially. Could I set up a system where a single number in stored in multiple variables?
Freaking huge
Do you want to keep the number as an integer or a string?
I need to be able to do math operations with it I’m new to vb so I’m not really sure how that would work but aren’t string variables also bound by certain value caps?
So with Long, you can store a number up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. Is that too small for you?
You’ll probably think I’m joking, but yes, it is
Do you have .NET 4.0? If so, there's [BigInteger](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics.biginteger?view=netframework-4.7.2), but if the number gets too large, you'll get an OutOfMemory exception.
The number would overflow a Long variable, so even a (signed) 64 bit integer is too small
Does setting enabled to false work? Not quite clear on your scenario
Let me explain. The list box shows the names of all the files in a directory (jpegs and the like). Using keystrokes I can move through the list and move the files to different folders. one hand on a and d, the other hand on the numpad. Each keypress event is handled to move the file and move the index of the list in a proper way, handling issues like if the current index exceeds the list count, etc. The problem arises when you manually interact with the list box. Changing the current selection triggers the SelectedIndexChanged event. I can set the event to update the image currently viewed and the like, but once I trigger a key event (such as move this file to this directory) the selectedindex changes and triggers the SelectedIndexChanged event handler again. It would make my life a whole lot easier if you couldn't interact with the listbox at all with the mouse. The tabstop is already taken care of (meaning you can't navigate to the list box using the tab key), which leaves the mouse clicking on a selection in the box. I want to prevent that. As for setting enabled to false, since my key press event handlers interact with it internally, that's simply not possible. 
That helps. I'm on mobile so I can't research right now but Google around for visual basic list box disable mouse only. I don't know off hand but the event args might be different for a mouse click vs a key press. I might have time to look later, this has pegged my curiosity now. You're using Win forms right?

You actually just added to my headache with that :). Seems I not only need to prevent mouse selection change but also key change when the box is selected. The course I \*was pursuing was changing the list's attributes as seen here: [https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/8eeed347-ede5-4a24-88f1-953acd16e774/preventing-listbox-selection-change?forum=wpf](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/8eeed347-ede5-4a24-88f1-953acd16e774/preventing-listbox-selection-change?forum=wpf) and explained here: [https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/7c352827-b4ed-493c-8a68-58179ad801fc/explanation-of-ishittestvisible](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/7c352827-b4ed-493c-8a68-58179ad801fc/explanation-of-ishittestvisible) Unfortunately I have no idea how or where to access those properties. With the keystrokes issue you just brought up, I think the easiest way about this is to make the list invisible. It can still be accessed by the event handlers. I'll add some labels here and there to display current file name and list count. Another idea was to just put a transparent box in front of the list to prevent mouse selection, but it seems making a transparent box is harder than it looks. &amp;#x200B;
Can you post code? I don't think I'm understanding you correctly. Because I was thinking if the key is up down a or d, do your stuff, otherwise just return from the function
I'd like to ask, why? Perhaps if you help us understand what you're trying to do with this program (part of the program) we can give some advice on how to achieve that end without this workaround.
As you mentioned above, with the listbox selected it autohandles moving the selection with the arrow keys. Which adds additional headaches. Below is the code for one of my button presses. Theres a lot of others, but this gives the basic jist of whats going on in each. Private Sub Form1_KeyPress(sender As Object, e As System.Windows.Forms.KeyPressEventArgs) Handles Me.KeyPress ' 'd' handler If Asc(e.KeyChar) = 100 Then 'we want to prevent d from pushing the index past the item count. If (Not ((ListBox1.SelectedIndex + 1) = ListBox1.Items.Count)) Then ListBox1.SelectedIndex = ListBox1.SelectedIndex + 1 Try PictureBox1.BackgroundImage = SafeImageFromFile(defaultPath &amp; "\" &amp; ListBox1.SelectedItem.ToString()) Display_pic_size(defaultPath &amp; "\" &amp; ListBox1.SelectedItem.ToString()) Catch ex As Exception End Try Else Label1.Text = "I can't move forward" End If End If ......... End Sub &amp;#x200B;
in addition to bignumbers, you could create an array of integers &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; you could store 1000 places or 2000 places or more and perform addition/subtraction/multiplication/division on them, but you would need to create your own class for this and it may take you some time - more time than you would wish to spend on it. &amp;#x200B; But what you would do is you would take a number - and you would break it up into short integer base 10 sets with a limit of 9,999 &amp;#x200B; so let's say you have the number 9000 you would have a short integer array with a single item that had a value of 9000 &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; if you had the number 10,002 you would have a short integer array with two items value for index zero = 2 value for index one = 1 &amp;#x200B; what you've done in effect is turn our base 10 system into a base 10,000 system. &amp;#x200B; So you as a person added or subtract, you go column by column - starting with the ones, then tens, then hundreds and so forth. You'd need to manually do the same thing here, except in 10,000. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; To do this, you would need a routine that would translate text into the array of short integers and a matching routine that would translate these arrays of integers back into a text string. &amp;#x200B; To add two numbers, you would need to translate both of them into these arrays and then add the value of one to the value of other -carrying over values from one index to the next index ... just as if you added 3 + 9, you would need to carry over 2 into the next column (the tens column). &amp;#x200B; division and multiplication and modulus and other computations would be possible too. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
If this doesn't help or i misunderstand, I apologise &amp;#x200B; But what I believe you want is to be able to interact with the listbox sometimes - when you move the keys and activate something ... but after that happens, you don't want any more interaction until your routine is done - you wrote 'Handling what it does at first is easy enough, but after another event triggers and moves the index manually, it still triggers this index changed event handler ' &amp;#x200B; So you want the first event to trigger something, but you don't want any events after that to trigger the same event - the first event may be triggered by a separate button or direct interaction with the listbox - you want that, but nothing after it until you are finished. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; If this is true, I would create a boolean variable - even a char/byte - that is not local to the event handler but above the scope of it ... let's say global in scope. A true/false boolean. &amp;#x200B; The first line of your event handler would be a comparison, if the boolean is true, exit the event handler immediately. The next line would then set that boolean as true. Then at the end of your event handling routine, when it is completely done (or if there is an error - you'd need to reset it in the exception part too), the boolean is reset to false &amp;#x200B; the comparison of the boolean to true could also be put in the listbox's key down event and mouse event - keydown because arrow keys aren't considered characters - they don't produce characters. Keydown would intercept arrow keys ... and pageup/pagedown and home/end (like arrows, take up to the top and bottom of the list). &amp;#x200B; I believe that the keypress is equivalent to the internal windows WM\_CHAR notification - some keys produce characters (a-z, 0-9 etcetera), but some key presses don't actually produce a character - arrow keys don't for example, so that's why in that post by Andrew, the solution is to intercept the keydown for the arrow keys - all key presses have a keydown and key up, but those that produce characters also have an addition window message of a character creation. That's why your listbox and textboxes and every other class have keypress events and keydown events. &amp;#x200B; You would want to add this single line to each of them - the mouse events too - making a single comparison with a single variable, so whilst I can understand anything may be a headache, there are much larger ones than what I am suggesting - it's just a single line in each event.
I must be really bad at explaining things, though I think I have the terminology correct. To start at the beginning, I am making an image sorter. You specify a source directory and assign destination directories to 8 buttons (the numpad keys, except 5 which is an undo). In the center of the program window it shows the image and there are 2 boxes that indicate your screen size and the image size in comparison (which I think is a great feature). Using the 'a' and 'd' keys I can move to the next image in the list or back and using the numpad keys I can assign to which directory the currently selected image will go. The intention is to make it as ergonomic as possible for maximum sorting effect with minimal effort. When a destination is set, the event handler that triggers will look for files in the source directory that end with a particular file type (jpeg, jpg, bmp, etc) and populate the list box with them. All this is working fine. I can handle any given keystroke for the specific keys and prevent referencing anything outside of the list box. All of that is working quite well. To reference the currently selected image I use this: ListBox1.SelectedItem.ToString() which is the filename and from this I can then move the file, etc. The problem arises when you select something in the list box with your mouse. This causes ListBox1.SelectedItem.ToString() to be something different (the thing you selected with your mouse). Selecting something with the mouse can trigger the event: ListBox1\_SelectedIndexChanged. What is unusual about ListBox1\_SelectedIndexChanged that that once this event handler is created, no matter if it is the mouse or a subroutine, once there is any change in the selection it will trigger that event. My solution so far has been to remove ListBox1\_SelectedIndexChanged event handler. But that leaves me with selecting something by mouse and screwing up the referencing. For instance, say I am currently viewing a picture of the alps on the main picture box and I mouse select the item "rain in france" or some such in the listbox. The image won't change because theres no routine to handle that (outside of ListBox1\_SelectedIndexChanged) and the image displayed will still be that of the alps. Though if I attempt to move the file it will move the rain picture instead. My desired solution is to make the imagebox inaccessible by mouse. In windows forms you can change the tab order or even prevent tabing over to an element in the form. But it does not prevent me from selecting a new item in the list with the mouse. My research indicated that the listbox and other things like buttons have basically a hitbox in the "wpf" (windows presentation foundation). See these two links: [https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/8eeed347-ede5-4a24-88f1-953acd16e774/preventing-listbox-selection-change?forum=wpf](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/8eeed347-ede5-4a24-88f1-953acd16e774/preventing-listbox-selection-change?forum=wpf) [https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/7c352827-b4ed-493c-8a68-58179ad801fc/explanation-of-ishittestvisible](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/7c352827-b4ed-493c-8a68-58179ad801fc/explanation-of-ishittestvisible) However I don't know how to set those attributes to false. So my current solution is to make the list invisible. To show the file name each event handler will have to display the text in the list's item selection to a label. Its an ugly workaround, but its worked so far as its prevented me from selecting something in the box with the mouse or even selecting the box at all. &amp;#x200B;
thanks :)
Sorry, I was traveling yesterday. So let me get this straight. This is what you want to happen. Up and Down arrows move items in the list box up and down when appropriate, handling the first and last items. A and D move them from one list box to another? 
Also, forget all the technical and programmer jargon, what is the problem you're trying to solve, as if you were explaining it to a non technical person? 
Are you getting any specific errors? 
I'm not, when it's a meeting attachment it just says "VBA has failed" then closes out. Otherwise it does nothing.
no, I don't want the arrows to interact with the listbox. I don't want the mouse to interact with the list box. I don't want anything to interact with the listbox unless I set it in a subroutine. I've set the a and d keys and the numpad keys to interact with it. Nothing else save setting the source directory should move the list selection. 
Ok, so if a and d and the numpad keys interact with it, on your selection changed, run an if to check for those specific keys. If it is not one of them, return. 
Have you considered putting these up on GitHub, to make the source handy to browse?
I use this a lot, but it's got a lot of issues, and I often end up looking for one or two other converters and seeing if between the couple of them I can discern what the code is supposed to be.
I see you found a solution with the LINQ strategy, but I figured for other searchers, I'd throw out there, that I've done some XmlNode-based XML reading in VB in my code, examples here: https://github.com/ocdtrekkie/HAController/blob/master/modMapQuest.vb https://github.com/ocdtrekkie/HAController/blob/master/modOpenWeatherMap.vb
In order to access the actual RTF you need to use the [RTF property](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.richtextbox.rtf?view=netframework-4.7.2#System_Windows_Forms_RichTextBox_Rtf) of the control. My guess is that you are using the Text property of the control which doesn't contain the formatting. Or that you loaded a file into the rich text box and didn't save it after editing.
The richtext for &amp;#x200B; The red fox jumps quickly. &amp;#x200B; with red in bold and jumps in italics is &amp;#x200B; {\\rtf1\\ansi\\ansicpg1252\\deff0\\deflang1033{\\fonttbl{\\f0\\fnil\\fcharset0 Times New Roman;}} {\\colortbl ;\\red0\\green0\\blue0;} \\viewkind4\\uc1\\pard\\f0\\fs32 The \\cf1\\b red\\cf0\\b0 fox \\cf1\\i jumps\\cf0\\i0 quickly.} &amp;#x200B; codes for richtext are prefixed with a slash b is the code for bold in html it would be &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; in richtext it's \\b \\b0 &amp;#x200B; italics is i and works the same &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; I use the richtext class directly through createwindowex. What Will\_Rickards links to with the RTFProperties is for the entire text - I don't see the listing for it immediately, but if there is a method that lets you insert text at a point - not just add it by copying the text, but an actually insertion without calling up the entire text - you would insert this richtext. &amp;#x200B; But if you inserted this text for the entire RTFproperties, you would indeed get a bold red and an italics jumps &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; if you call up your wordpad and write something and save it on your harddrive, you can open it with a notepad and see the codes for it. Richtext always begins with rtf1 (actually there is a unicode version that I believe has a variant, something like urtf1) and then it uses ansi in the standard usage (characters above 127 are coded as hexadecimal, prefixed with \\') &amp;#x200B; Then there is a font name and colour table - I'm not sure what defaults are used if you leave those out, but that's what that red green blue is for - the forecolour of the text - and Times New Roman is the default font. Font sizes are twice the font size, so for a 16 point font, you enter fs32. \\pard means new paragraph, with the d indicating default. &amp;#x200B; if that richtext I gave you works for you, I'd say that the easiest thing you could do for the future if you want other styles - superscript or background/foreground colours different or size is to type out the text in wordpad and save it and then look at the codes in your notepad. &amp;#x200B; Most/all of the basic codes for html work with easy equivalents - except a few: hr (but that's depreciated in html). br as an equivalent in richtext is actually the vertical tab, character 11, which is not the horizontal tab, character 9. The main use of it for richtext is when you have a bullet line, which is a sort of paragraph, and the text extends beyond the line, if you hit return, a new bullet point appears, but if you use the vertical tab character, you go to a new line as if it were a continuation of the same paragraph/bullet &amp;#x200B;
The short answer is: Yes, you can have multiple objects move at different speeds. The next piece of info I want to give you is; start small, add one thing at a time and make sure it works, then add another thing. A helpful thing to know; Look into [WPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation), they have animation and it will be SO much better than manually moving the pictures the way you are (been there, done that, wfp is better) Note: Create a "fruit" object, (instead of: fruitStrawberry, fruitPear, etc) Each Fruit object can have a TYPE property (look into emum) then "simply" add as many of those and move them as necessary. [Here](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/23257/%2FArticles%2F23257%2FBeginner-s-WPF-Animation-Tutorial) is a simple animation example in WPF. In WPF animations are smoother and don't have the issues you're gonna have with Timers, that will block your code execution when you attempt to click on them. I know I've dumped a lot on you, and learning software is a bitch (I've been doing it for a long time, started with VB 2.0, not .NET 2.0, Classic 2.0) but it's good to start getting that learning, research is going to be part of your life, FOREVER! &lt;insert evil laugh here&gt; (I'm currently learning VR, so you know, it's always, always about learning) I'd rather point you at better tools, platforms than to have you spend time learning bad things. Also, know to take breaks. You'll get frustrated, so walk away, play a game, whatever. These things can take some time, so don't be upset you don't know it all, you NEVER will. (NO ONE will)
almost certainly not when using that function. you'd need to pull the value into a variable first, then do the replace. if this is going to be run frequently it's probably worth looking at the overall project and redesigning it be manageable and maintainable.
@chrwei thanks for the response. Would you have any recommendations on how to do that? I tried a different alternative last night which cycles through all cells and works sheet by sheet, but was having trouble looping through multiple worksheets within the workbook. Here's the code &amp;#x200B; Sub ForEach\_Loop() Dim cell As Range For Each cell In ActiveSheet.UsedRange.cells cells.Find(What:="\*CODE\*", After:=ActiveCell, LookIn:=xlFormulas, LookAt \_ :=xlPart, SearchOrder:=xlByColumns, SearchDirection:=xlNext, MatchCase:= \_ False, SearchFormat:=False).Activate Selection.Copy Selection.PasteSpecial Paste:=xlPasteValues, Operation:=xlNone, SkipBlanks \_ :=False, Transpose:=False Next cell End Sub
don't use copy and paste. use the .Value and .Formula cell properties.
Are you looking to do this with a macro? That might be difficult. Your best bet would be a console app using raw VB (or C#) and spitting out a new csv or excel file. 
[This](http://codevba.com/excel/for_each_cell_in_range.htm#.XDUDslxKhEY) will show you various ways you can loop through a Excel cells
You can also draw directly on the form with windows forms. i threw an example together, all you need is an empty form1 and this code behind: Public Class Form1 Public rnd As New Random(Guid.NewGuid.GetHashCode) Public Objects As New List(Of DrawObject) Public WithEvents t As New Timer Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load Me.Width = 640 Me.Height = 480 t.Interval = 100 t.Start() For i = 0 To 10 Dim obj As New DrawObject With {.X = rnd.Next(10, 630), .Y = 0, .Radius = rnd.Next(10, 30), .Speed = rnd.Next(10, 30)} Objects.Add(obj) Next End Sub Private Sub Form1_Paint(sender As Object, e As PaintEventArgs) Handles Me.Paint Dim g As Graphics = e.Graphics For Each obj As DrawObject In Objects g.DrawEllipse(New Pen(Color.Black), obj.X, obj.Y, obj.Radius, obj.Radius) obj.Y += obj.Speed If obj.Y + obj.Radius &gt; 480 Then obj.Y = 0 obj.X = rnd.Next(10, 630) End If Next End Sub Private Sub t_Tick(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles t.Tick Me.Refresh() End Sub End Class Public Class DrawObject Public X As Integer Public Y As Integer Public Radius As Integer Public Speed As Integer End Class 
Hm ok I’ll try this out when I get home thanks :) Learning enums is confusing me a bit lol so this looks like a neat alternative 
An Enum is just a word instead of a number. so you can in code refere to your cherry as fruits.cherry instead of lets say 5 Public Enum Fruits Apple = 1 Cherry = 5 End Enum dim i as integer = 1 + fruits.cherry 'is 6 of course enums are not meant to be used to calculate, just so you understand you just replace the number in code by a word, the compiler will then later replace the words by the numbers. 
Oh ok. So can you do arrays with them too or no? Cause i asked my teacher today and she said she wasn’t sure because it might give an overflow error or something 
Yeah, you can do arrays with them too. It really is nothing different to an integer (or whatever type you give the enum) Public Enum Fruits as SByte Apple = 1 'ok Cherry = 5 ' ok Banana = 500 ' error, larger than sbyte data type End Enum
Ohhh ok that’s probably what she meant then. Thanks 
So unfortunately, unless you have the data in an already existing database or even excel sheet, it will have to be manually entered somewhere. But once you have that data, you can loop through it to spit out questions and answers. Since it's for homework I'm assuming you don't need a database? If that's the case, I'd use a list of objects. You could have a parent "Question" object with a question text property and then a list&lt;QuestionAnswer&gt; property The QuestionAnswer object would have two properties, a string answer text and a bool is correct property. Then you can loop through them to display questions. 
Dim c as Color = bmp.GetPixel(x, y) 
Check out this site if you want an api that does all the Q &amp; A for you: [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) 
Well you already have everything you need. Just remove remove the cursor position and add the screen location.
I'm not sure what I should replace the mouse coordinates with to be honest, that's why I opened this post
Like this: `g.CopyFromScreen(New Point(800, 100), New Point(0, 0), New Size(1, 1))` &amp;#x200B;
Isn’t this exactly what getpixel does?
Use copyfromscreen to get the entire screen into the bitmap then enter the x and y coordinates you want into getpixel. 
What steps are you wanting your program to take?
We can't really do your homework for you, what we generally need to see is what steps you have taken so far and/or where EXACTLY you are stuck. If you can include your code. Take things one step at a time, it'll help you avoid getting overloaded and frustrated. (I've been doing this for 20+ years, and I still get frustrated, so don't be hard on yourself. There is a ton to learn) &amp;#x200B; basic example; Dim i as integer = 10 Dim x as integer = 20 dim total as integer &amp;#x200B; total = i + x &amp;#x200B;
For the first one it's: s = 0 For i = 3 to 203 step 4 S = S + i
Thank you so much. Sorry if I used the subreddit wrong. :)
Thank you so much :)
I actually wanted the actual addition of the series
No worries. Simply informing you so you know.
So if I’m not mistaken, the collision is caused by .Copy() copying data to the clipboard, which as you have found, will only work reliably if it’s the only thing using the clipboard. I found a little article about copying data in excel without using the clipboard, here: https://jdunkerley.co.uk/2015/02/04/excel-vba-copy-and-paste-special-without-clipboard/amp/ Hopefully it helps!
He started spamming boards with virus links lol 
YES! Assuming ".Paste()" still has what you copied is dangerous. The linked article seems to offer a good alternative. There are many other ways to set values in Excel besides copy/paste (which you do in your code). For example: Google "Range.Copy" which can do all that work without using the clipboard. I advise to avoid even using ".select" and other things such as "activating workbooks". If you watch your code execute and Excel starts "jumping around" doing things (such as activating, selecting, copying), in order to read and set values, then it is going to be needlessly SLOW. This is because Excel is acting as if you are DOING these things with your MOUSE. These same things can be done all IN MEMORY not causing Excel to try to SHOW YOU what its doing. Its best to avoid these. At a minimum turn screen updating OFF, the back ON when your code is done. Application.ScreenUpdating = False/True
That was it! Thanks.
You think you helped them but you didn't help them. 
Such a nub...
thanks!! gonna try it when im back home:D &amp;#x200B;
Can you elaborate a little more on what your problem is? Not from a technical standpoint but explain what you're trying to do as if talking to a non programmer
I have a grouping(Array) of different functions that correlate with a grid of panels and change the color of that specific function's panel. For example, the function in my grouping that is in Array(1)(1) is the function that changes the color of Panel 1,1. I am making a maze game using Microsoft's form elements(The Panels) and have the functions working to where if I invoke(run) a function directly, it changes the corresponding panels color, but I can't figure out how to have these functions in an array so when the player moves from 1,1 to 1,2, it invokes(run) the function that is in the array spot 1,2
This is how you get a single function and store it in a delegate. Dim myFunction as Function(of Integer) = AddressOf FunctionName This is a list of delegates, with one function added to the list Dim myList as new List(Of Function(of Integer)) myList.Add( AddressOf FunctionName ) 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/delegates/
Ok that helps. Any way you can't just use those indexes to find the proper panel? Or keep a dictionary of int, panel and then call the same function? I'm not 100% clear on the ins and outs of your program but why can't you have a function that takes in the indexes i.e. this is pseudo but Sub ChangeColor(index1 as Int, index2 as Int) 'logic here to find the panel, you could name them ids sequentially and use find control 'you could store a list of them where the index in the list corresponds 'to your index in your array End Sub Then in your code you'd call ChangeColor(Array(0), Array(0)(0)) or in some other manner. If you can post your full code I might be able to help more
Delegates pointed me in the right direction and I got my array of functions working. Thanks for the tip!
It's a lot easier when you know the right word to look for, isn't it. 
It is. I am just now getting into VB because of a possible employment opportunity with a company that makes software for banks. I have learned C# in the past but there are many differences in VB to C#
Then you definitely want to read these: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_C_Sharp_and_Visual_Basic_.NET https://www.harding.edu/fmccown/vbnet_csharp_comparison.html And for the sake of your long term career, make sure you learn both. It is much easier to find C# jobs than VB jobs, so you really don't want to get yourself as VB-only.
Arrays in .NET do not have a .count method, they only have a .length property. The reason you will see a .count method is because .NET has something called extension methods, which are functions that are made available to lots of different data types in a generic way. This may be getting a bit advanced, but arrays implement an IEnumerable interface, which is the interface to do with objects that can be enumerated over like arrays and lists. Basically objects that hold a bunch of objects within them. the .count method is made available to all types that implement the IEnumerable interface, and array is one of those types. That is why you see both. count and length will return the same value when called. The answer to your second question is that where (also an extension method, not a native method to the array object) will filter the contents of the array and return those matching the where condition (in your example, it is filtering out any null strings from the array and returning a new array that doesn't have those empty elements in it).
Thx for the clarification, it helps a lot. As for the where method what's the purpose for its 1st parameter , as for as I know the 2nd parameter is the actual condition. (TextBox.Lines = TextBox.Lines.Where(Function(array) Not String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(array)).ToArray())
Everything figured out but the main part of the game?
the purpose for the parameter is passing the current relevant array value into you function. Maybe it helps if i rewrite the function TextBox.Lines.Where(Function(array) Not String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(array)).ToArray()) is the same as following pseudo code: dim result For Each Line in Textbox.Lines if String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(line) then continue for result.add(line) next Textbox.Lines = result

Put your keys in a [csv file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1405038/reading-a-csv-file-in-net), create a loop through the keys and call your vbs with each key using the process class: https://bytes.com/topic/visual-basic-net/answers/486435-how-do-you-launch-vbscript-within-vb-net if you need the output of the vbs you have to rewrite it a little i think, the best search term for that is probably piping
You want the Form's [KeyPress](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2752424/detecting-enter-keypress-on-vb-net) event (also KeyDown or KeyUp work) Also the code in the button should be placed in it's own function, then call that function from the button and from the keypress. (meaning, don't call the button\_click event from the KeyPress)
ok thanks &amp;#x200B;
Win forms or web forms?
Win forms or web forms?
windows forms? look for the acceptbutton property of your form. asp.net? i think it was Form.DefaultButton wpf? i think wpf managed that on the buttons itself, so button.isDefault iirc
So for the "dice rolling" you'll be using the math.rand function. You can specify min and max numbers (in this case 1 and 6) and then just call next to get random numbers. Honestly, that just looks like the manually spaced text in a text box. I.e. they literally output like ================================== column headers ================================== And then spaced the numbers using the space bar. Is that a requirement? I'm assuming this is for homework? If so can you put it in a gridview? That would be a little easier to work with. Lastly, I'm not sure what you mean by frequency or probability. Is probability the number of times a specific number was rolled for a given run? Don't have a clue on probability as I feel like it could mean a lot of things. 
Frenquency is how many times the sum of the 3 dice was equal to that specific number and probability is just the same thing but in percentage so for example if the sum was 4, 2/4 times it would be 50% for 4
For the spacing, you could use .padright and .padleft to get them to stay within a column.
This helps a lot thanks
When you do things like this, you always want to start at the end and work backwards. Otherwise the list can get confused. (So For item as Integer = 20 downto 5) Alternately, copy the first 5 items to a temporary list, clear the list box, then re-add the items from the temporary list.
Multiple ways to do this: Your issues is that you always want to remove the 5th index lstList.Items.RemoveAt(5) because you want to keep index 0, 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4 (5 items) so as long as the loop can continue, remove the 5th index (the 6th item) another way to do this is with a while loop that might seem a little more intuitive 'as long as we have more than 5 items While listbox1.items.count &gt; 5 'remove the 5th index (the 6th item since index starts at 0) listbox1.items.removeat(5) End While
Alright, thanks! I think I'll use the second method
What CharlieMay describes is perfect, however if you do have hundreds of items in the list, it would actually be quicker and more efficient to do what you describe - clearing the entire list and then adding the five. &amp;#x200B; I'm just adding this to explain the notion of how a person is able to speed up a program ... or rather some of the things that are able to slow down a program. &amp;#x200B; With your example of 5 to 20 removing, what you're doing is making 15 individual calls to a routine, but if you were let's say removing 1000 entries, removing rows 1005 to 5 will loop through one-thousand times. No matter if you wrote it out 1000 times or it's in a loop, it's still 1000 lines that are being executed. If you only wanted to save the first five and remove the one-thousand lines after it, in that case it would be quicker to clear the entire listbox and then add the five lines as new entries because that is six function calls (one to clear and five listbox inserts) versus 1000 individual calls to delete ... so you've saved in that example about 990 calls to routines: you've made the program do the same thing, but you've done it much more quickly. &amp;#x200B;
in short, you implement the google drive API. maybe there's a library for it, if you're lucky.
i’ve already got the api working to upload files it’s just downloading them back again, my application is being used across multiple computers so i need them to be able to download them again so everyone has updated data.
you'll need to ask a more specific question. I can't even imagine what you're missing. if you're using google's library, download is in the example.
Here is a sample in c#, you can easily convert this to vb.net https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/dotnet
Do you have access to the source code of the .exe? Are there any APIs? 
This is everything you need to know about writing lines on text to a file: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/how-to-write-text-to-files-with-a-streamwriter
Use javascript for this. 
I'm lost on where the Visual Basic comes in here. Do you have some backend code or something you can share?
If you want people to check it out you should post the source code. Not too many people are going to download a random exe and run it even if it is safe.
If I did that people would know it’s a virus
[Bold strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ru8DMW-grY)
So it is?
no
In that case, it might be a good idea to upload the source code to somewhere like GitHub.
Im just want to make a form in vb, that was auto check the newest firmware is running in the device. The form get the product id and search in the devices support website by the firmware version. If is find newest, download them and install it. Now i can succefully done with the product id, but the firmware\_table input is unknown, i dont know how to get it.
Curious, are you trying “ElseIf” or “Else If”?
i write else if and then it corrects itself to elsif but both give the error
If you add something/anything right below the .Add line does it execute without issues? I am just trying to confirm that it moves on past the .Add line. What is the error message that you are getting?
For Visual basic, IF-THEN statements have at least two parts. &amp;#x200B; The two parts can be on separate lines or on a single line: &amp;#x200B; SEPARATE LINES: IF (something = something) \[does something if true\] ELSE \[does something if not true \] END IF &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; ON A SINGLE LINE IF (something = something) THEN \[does something if true\] &amp;#x200B; The single line has two actions occurring in a single line. That is what is happening in your case. You have set up an action to occur without the possibility of an ELSE, so &amp;#x200B; If (rbPetit.Checked \[is true\]) Then lbFacture.Items.Add("h") if this checked value is anything except zero, add "h" &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; A single line IF THEN doesn't need a separate END IF. Having the separate END IF is causing an error because it's one too many closing statements for something that was never opened. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
yes it does onlt the else if and the end if dont work The error is "else if must be preceded by an if"
This worked thanks!

Since the ID needs to be accessed from multiple clients, I would either store the ID in a SQL table or create a SQL function to query the last ID. There are plenty of ways to do what you're asking for, but it sounds like something I would handle at the database level then query as needed from the application.
i am not sure if i really understood your request but maybe you are asking how to find the last inserted ID in a sql table? if so then: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9477502/get-the-last-inserted-row-id-with-sql-statement
what isn't working about it, exactly? set a breakpoint and step through. make sure values are what you expect, and logic flows as you expect. one thing, "empty" and "null" are not the same thing. your text box checks very likely never null... unless there's no text box.
An error occurs when I enter the wrong values and click the login button. I added an image of the error. It says "Run-time error '424': Objscg required"
In one place you refer to txtLoginID/ txtPassword, and in another you refer to UserName/Password.
I think that is the issue. Thank you. 
 txtloginID is the username input box and txtPassword is the password input box. UserName and Password are the column names of the Users table &amp;#x200B; [https://imgur.com/a/UMjXqMd](https://imgur.com/a/UMjXqMd)

where are you defining Username.value?
What's the exact error? Excel developer window has an IDE... where does it crash at if you step through the program?
You might have more luck on r/VBA and you know... providing some information. 
Does the new user have a different version of office ? 
He work's in a cubicle, so yeah. Not sure how that is relevant tho.
If he has a different version of office e.g. your macro is written in office 2015 and he's running 2013 you'd probably find he's missing object libraries.
This is usually caused by mismatched dlls. His pc is going to have a different version of some dll than you have. I'm not sure how it works in vba, but if this were vb, you could usually create a package installer to run on his pc. Like someone else said, you can try updating his office to the same version you have. 
Technically you would just use the line `SetWindowLongPtr(Me.Handle, -20, &amp;H0)` to reset your form to normal. Your issue however, lies in how you will trigger this to happen. When your form is set to be transparent and click through, the `Form_KeyDown` event will no longer fire the moment you click on something else on screen because your application will now lose focus as even though it's the topmost application, it still needs to be the active window to trigger the `Form_KeyDown` event. To get around this roadblock, we'll need to set our own keyboard hook so our program can directly listen for keyboard events versus trying to use built-in .NET events. Using [this page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15038413/how-to-listen-keyboard-in-background-and-fire-keystrokes-on-demand), you can easily create your own keyboard hook class to throw custom events for key presses which we'll require in this scenario. Then in your form's code, you can use the following to create a simple toggle (I used the backslash key `\`) Imports System.Runtime.InteropServices Public Class Form_TransparentClickThru &lt;DllImport("user32.dll", EntryPoint:="SetWindowLong")&gt; Public Shared Function SetWindowLong(ByVal hWnd As IntPtr, ByVal nIndex As Integer, ByVal dwNewLong As Integer) As Integer End Function &lt;DllImport("user32.dll", EntryPoint:="SetLayeredWindowAttributes")&gt; Public Shared Function SetLayeredWindowAttributes(ByVal hWnd As IntPtr, ByVal crKey As Integer, ByVal alpha As Byte, ByVal dwFlags As Integer) As Boolean End Function Private WithEvents KBHook As New KeyboardHook Private Toggled As Boolean Private Sub KBHook_KeyUp(ByVal Key As System.Windows.Forms.Keys) Handles KBHook.KeyUp Console.WriteLine(Key.ToString) If Key.ToString = "Oem5" Then If Toggled Then Me.TopMost = False Call SetWindowLong(Me.Handle, -20, &amp;H0) Call SetLayeredWindowAttributes(Me.Handle, 0, 255, &amp;H20) Else Me.TopMost = True Call SetWindowLong(Me.Handle, -20, &amp;H80000 Or &amp;H20) Call SetLayeredWindowAttributes(Me.Handle, 0, 128, &amp;H2) End If Toggled = Not Toggled End If End Sub End Class
&gt;SetWindowLongPtr(Me.Handle, -20, &amp;H0) thanks a lot! the code doesnt work i get a lot error messages but all i gonna need will be the disable code, i edited SetWindowLongPtr(Me.Handle, -20, &amp;H0) to &amp;#x200B; SetWindowLong(Me.Handle, -20, &amp;H0) and created two new subs one activate and the other deactivate, i created another form where i start the sub activate der deactivate, works well! &amp;#x200B; i use visual studio 2017 maybe thats why your key hook doesnt work, im still an beginner at visual studio so im not actually sure what causes the code not to work.. anyways! THANKS for your anwser, helped me a lot! \*thumbsup\*
[Here's a copy of the project to demo what I was talking about.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1p_L4CRtwE5ZtqDmUpCo0S7n7d9n3MYYj)
huge thanks for helping me! i just wonder why the code works in the project file youve send me thxx!! ive posted another question r/visualbasic could you help me there too? and again thank you for your time Viper!=)
Can you just add the same square thing to your hover image?
There isn't a specific format or way to save user data (drats) as it depends on what the needs are. ie: Do users need their data where ever they login, then the data would be stored on a server or database. There are ways/reasons to store this in the Windows Registry, though this has largely been depreciated to XML or other forms of local storage. I know this is not quite the info you were looking for, but it's better that you know your options/issues.
Thanks for the reply! I would be storing the XML, or some other formatted file, on a LAN. I was wondering if there was some common practice to follow. 
The one thing you DON'T do is store user data in the "Program Files" folder. The answer to storing it locally or on a server depends on user needs. If it were me I would store it on the network that way when users get a new machine, or log into another machine, their configuration is quickly/automatically available. But that's a statement without all the info... so, you know better than I
well formed xml is the standard, or maybe YAML. anything beyond that is your custom requirements.
i tried a lot of things but nothin worked im also not that good at cooding themes at all
Hint: If conditions can be reapplied to a true/false property
Short answer is xml or ini or even csv (simple spreadsheet). You want something that can be edited with a simple notepad, which is what xml, ini, and csv have in common. &amp;#x200B; I'd also suggest that you look at how other programs do it. For example, Mozilla Firefox. Mozilla Firefox has a file called userContent.css that lets you edit the appearance a bit - and as JamesWjRose says, don't store it in the Program Folder. Firefox specifically stores the information per user ...you could store it on your LAN folder, just as long as the folder is accessible for all the accounts that log in and for editing, that any account that edits it has write access to that folder. If you want a single file for all accounts or separate files per account, that would affect it. If you didn't know, Windows 10 down to Windows 2000 all have specific APPLICATION DATA folders. Separate ones are created per account by Windows and there is also an ALL USERS application data. Firefox uses this folder for example and if you don't use your LAN folder, those aren't outrageous to use. The only bad thing about the APPLICATION DATA folders is that some people don't always know where to find it - I mean if it's not you that will be doing the editing of the file and it's some other user who knows how to browse the internet and use programs, but doesn't go through the filesystem for specific folders, that person will have trouble finding the correct folder and it will seem to her/him as if you've purposely hidden the folder. MyDocuments is also another choice - more easily accessible for every user. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; The longer details - if it helps you: xml can become a bit confusing if you have a lot of it with so many brackets and it can also get a little confusing if you come back to it in 6 months to edit it, or worse if it's someone else editing it. It can be done easily, but mistakes also are easy with that sort of files so I would add at least a few lines of instructions to the top of the xml &lt;!-- as information tags of course--&gt; indicating the general format - possibly even reminding people to make a copy of the file before editing. Reading and writing to xml from inside the application would be fairly easy - visual basic has internal xml reading ability ... editing it externally is fairy easy ... however if the person editing it EVER accidentally deletes a &lt; or &gt;, then the entire thing will get messed up and it becomes a bit of a pain to correct it when you're looking for a single &lt; or &gt; ... or worse, if someone edits it and saves it in a different encoding so you're trying to read UTF-8 and the coding is UTF-16. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Windows itself uses xml AND still uses some ini files - they are a bit easier with the eye than xml, so I want to mention them. The standard for ini files is they are text with each line (crlf as a new line) is a new value Windows ini sometimes use categories headers in brackets \[fonts\] and \[colours\] or whatever categories you have, but really just for editing separately from the program, your separate data file could really be as simple as: backcolour=255 forecolour=0 message=hello world &amp;#x200B; Even in windows 10, there is an option to view hidden files and if you do that, you'll find various ini files in some folders - this is how Windows is keeping track of some information too. XML is sometimes considered more elegant or modern, but I'm mentioning ini because a simple line per value is a windows standard still in use that works for the operating system and you shouldn't make it more complicated if your information isn't really that complex (which is sounds like it isn't complex). &amp;#x200B; This sort of file will always be smaller than an xml file and it offers easier readability to the eye. You'd still want a few lines of instructions. Reading this sort of file from inside your program ought to be fairly easy - every crlf is a new set of values. And external edits are fairly easy too. And format errors are fairly easy to catch - just a name, equal sign, and then a value, text string or numerical. &amp;#x200B; CSV is a bit like ini. CSV is a very simple spreadsheet format - it can be opened and saved in excel or just about any spreadsheet application. It's just set of rows of "values" with multiple columns (assuming you need multiple column - if not, it can become identical to an ini file). If you had more complicated values than simple strings, such as strings with carriage-return+line-feed inside them, you'll want to use csv format (stands for comma separated values). You do need something to read it from inside your application - visual basic has odbc ability to read a csv spreadsheet as if it were a database recordset, but if you're not familiar with that, I wouldn't suggest you start. But if you've ever dealt with csv before, it would be brilliant to use your knowledge for it here. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Just so I'm clear you have one image for your button and one for hover correct? If so can you post both of them?
Thank you! The ini approach is appealing. It definitely sounds like easy editing for even a beginner, especially if I add instructions. I eventually want to pass off the application which is why I'm looking for an easily editable file for the non core aspects of the program. Currently I'm the only programmer. The app does currently parse a couple of excel files and performs queries to a SQL Server, including updates and inserts. I've used a database for variable loading in other applications but for this particular development it isn't the right fit. 
What I missed when trying this bc I was curious was making sure it evaluated whenever it was clicked, not just when it was checked. 
Look into logic gates ;]
image1.visible = checkbox1.checked
Replace the delete line with this Range(“F” &amp; activecell.row &amp; “:V” &amp; activecell.row).ClearContents
 sh.Rows(ActiveCell.Row).EntireRow.Delete
note that this clears data, not deletes-and-shifts
I like this post, this is a good post.
I lol'd
Yes, it seems like that is what he was looking for, but is hard to tell without a picture. If they are removing data from a row that has data below it, you certainly wouldn't want data shifting up. The main point is that he grabs the appropriate range to either ClearContents, Clear or Delete.
Your thought process sounds about right. To take your idea even further (Not necessary but it's a possible future step) is to create a class (could be just 2 or 3) for several files at a time and use multithreading to process them in parallel. And instead of a List, you could use a Queue as each class knocks a step off the queue until there's nothing left to do and the file is completely processed. If any problems are encountered, the UI can prompt for user input, and since it's multithreaded, other files will still be able to be processed in the background while the user works on the current prompt. Or you could only spin up another thread if a prompt is created so files will always be processing.
thanks for the affirmation! wasnt sure if what I was saying made any sense. hopefully the end product comes out okay xD
Is listbox1 a member of form1? You might have to identify the container.
Just so I'm clear, you have a class with some data, and you're trying to add that data to controls? Can you post your class file? This is a shot in the dark, but why aren't you doing this on your form load? I.e. Sub Form1_Load ListBox1.Items.Add(MyClass.SomeProperty) ListBox1.Items.Add("blah2") End Sub Also, try not to get in the habit of letting VS autoname things listbox1 listbox2 you'll only curse yourself years from now when trying to work with it. Take the 10 seconds and change the ID property to something that makes sense :)
Impossible to tell from what you've posted, but the explanations I can come up with are: - The code in the class is calling the property from another thread - The code in the class does not reference the correct instance of `Form1`
The weird thing is the value is being passed to the property because the msgbox can display it properly. Any control reference appears to be ignored. "Blah" won't even go into the listbox.
Control name change suggestion noted. The listbox blah add is just for testing to see if the property was executing. It is executing and the message box is working, but nothing else is. Everything works properly if I call it from Form2 instead of the class file.
Yes it is.
Well that's what you would want to do. You have to call the listbox from whatever form is it's parent. If you can post your full code and a better description of what you're trying to accomplish, we can help more
Well I'm not sure what to tell you then.
Hard to post all the code but here is the relevant class code: [https://i.imgur.com/TVgiYp5.png](https://i.imgur.com/TVgiYp5.png) Again, the message box is triggered by this code, but both listbox adds are not. If I do the exact same code from Form2, all msgbox and listbox adds work.
how are you call it? are you sure you're calling it on the existing instance of the form and not making a new temporary instance?
I am sure because the msgbox is displaying it, but the listbox are not, nor any other type of control.
if it's a new instance the message box would still display.
I can call the same "Form1.ReceiveText" property from another form in the project and it works fine. I just found out I can call the same property from another Public Sub in the class file and it works as well. If I call it from this specific Public Sub it doesn't. (See the screen shot I posted on the other comment for the class code)
Something basic like this is certainly not a weird code problem. I can’t tell you the solution or point your in the right direction without seeing the entirety of your code
it really seems like a context issue. use a pastebin or github to show the whole test case, in text, not images.
Your idea of the message box still working if another instance was in play had me curious so I tried MsgBox(Me.GetHashCode &amp; ": " &amp; Value) and sure enough, the messages that worked have the same hash code and the ones from that function have a different hash code. All the functions use the exact same reference form and language so I have no idea how this is the case. I have no idea howto reference the running form correctly I guess.
 FirstNumber = (CDbl(Inputbox("Enter first number.", "First number"))) This works, but it's not ideal because it doesn't properly sanitise the input. The program will crash if the user enters something that cannot be CDbl-ed, and it does not recognise when the user hits the cancel button. But it works.
Can you keep the values in a list of doubles? Basically, your form has one text box, and three buttons. One says add number, one says calculate, and one says reset. Then in your code (this is pseudo) You could also add a label for output Dim numbers = new List(of Double) 'if they clicked the add number button sub addNumberClick 'clear out the message output.text = string.empty 'check that they put in a number if not isnumeric(textbox1.text) then output.text = "Please enter a valid number" exit sub end if 'if we're here it's a valid number, store it and reset the textbox numbers.Add(Cdbl(textbox1.text)) textbox1.text = string.empty end sub 'if they clicked reset sub resetClick numbers.Clear() end sub 'if they clicked calculate sub calculateClick dim total as double = 0 for each num in numbers total += num next dim avg as double = total / numbers.count output.text = avg.ToString() end sub
I don't do a lot with vb.net, my VB work is mostly v6, but in C# to solve a similar issue I've used a singleton reference. I'm not sure what's the best/proper way in your case. public partial class MainWindow : Window { public static MainWindow MyWindow; public MainWindow() { MyWindow = this; } public void bar() { //code here; } } public class xyz { void foo() { //MainWindow refers to the class definition, not the instance. MyWindow is a static reference to the instance MainWindow.MyWindow.bar(); } } this is a basic example, production should have code to detect multiple instance and do something smart
What about using the keypressed event and checking the validity of the input (is it a number?) and if it's not a number, discard the input?
What's the error message?
No error, it just won't connect..... i tried entering a username and couldn't find it in the database
I'm not sure what you mean. It should always do something, either what you ask or throw an exception. Do you know how to step through the code one line at a time?
 Do you know how to step through the code one line at a time? ---- Not really I'm not sure what you mean. It should always do something, either what you ask or throw an exception.------ what i am trying to say is that, the code i used is not really functioning... there is no error to detect if its working or not, neither is there an exception... once i run the program it starts up without any exception or error... but the input i made in the module has not displayed, so i can confirm if the project has been connected to the sqlite database.. do you understand?
Read this: https://kodify.net/csharp/visual-studio/step-code-debug/ By stepping through the code one line at a time, you can often see mistakes that were not apparent just by looking at it. I'm a 20 year pro and I still do this whenever things aren't working right. 
&gt; but the input i made in the module has not displayed, Uh, where are you trying to display it? I'm not seeing any lines that read from the database.
i am trying to send you a picture of the code.
i am supposed to see the username, i entered in the module, in the database 
I understand that you don't know how to do a basic thing that you need to do to write code--debug it. Start with the link.
I already debugged it and there is no error
Debugging != "finding an error code" man. How do you know it's not connecting if before this thread you didn't know how to go line by line? I am not trusting of your assumptions at this point. Can you tell if the table is actually getting created? Before you insert data into it? Based on your post, I'm not even sure you know. You need to find the exact line that your code is failing, error code or not.
Alright Thank you.... It doesn't create table and other fields, that shows there is something wrong. I tried finding the error over the night no head way. How do I get the exact line where my code is failing. I followed the link I was given and checked it as shown in the article. Yet i wasn't seeing the red sign before the green line when I run the application. 
Well, that's where you come in. You know the table creation step does not execute, so the problem is logically and chronologically on or before the `cmd.ExecuteNonQuery()` line. Do you actually have a file called "school.db" located on your desktop? Because I don't see in the code where a database would get created--if that were not the case. What is the code you copied anyway? Do these classes even work with SQLite? I know that SQLite documentation provides a class for .NET, but it doesn't look like you're using that here. https://system.data.sqlite.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki What is the tutorial you are using? 
This was what I was looking for, thanks man! I did so many unnecessary steps to get to the conclusion that I just needed to substitute the textbox part with the inputbox part, but yeah it works for what I needed it for.
What do you mean by 'put them together'? You want one to run after the other? 
I wish I could help brother 
is this in VB classic?
This I know how to do, however, it is not what I am looking for unfortunately as it is not part of the system tray itself, but more part of the taskbar (similar to having the "Address" bar added).
Double click on them in the form. It should generate the click event for you for each button
I know that. what I want is, when I click all three buttons it will trigger form to open. &amp;#x200B;
Three global variables then. Set one to true for each click and a function that checks all three each click
can you show me how to do that? sorry, I don't know how.
Can you post the code for your form?
I don't have one yet. cause I wanted to use IF ELSE STATEMENT but it doesn't work for Button Clicks.
If your looking for like a pin system, like lets say pig carrot gem. You could have each one append a string, and then have a timer check to see if the string contains the specific set (pcg) then trigger the form load
Did you actually add a reference to the DLL inside your project from the project properties menu?
I did indeed
Here's an example of a form with 3 buttons that does something once all 3 have been clicked. Not necessarily the best way to do this, but I went for simplicity. Public Class Form2 ' Note how the "Handles" has more than 1 button listed... ' this allows us to use a single event handler (this Sub) for many buttons Private Sub Button_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click, Button2.Click, Button3.Click ' the "sender" parameter refers to the button that was clicked. ' We will "cast" Is to a button type to make working with it easier ' "Casting" means taking an object of one type and telling VB that it ' will be used as another type. In this case, the "sender" Object ' is to be treated as a Button (called "btn") Dim btn = CType(sender, Button) ' each VB control has a ".tag" property that you can use any way you see fit. ' to keep this simple, we will simply assign it a string that says "clicked" btn.Tag = "clicked" ' Now we need to check if all our buttons have been clicked. Since there are ' only a few buttons, we will do it by checking each of them If CStr(Button1.Tag) = "clicked" And CStr(Button2.Tag) = "clicked" And CStr(Button3.Tag) = "clicked" Then MsgBox("Open your form here!") End If End Sub End Class
If you have a Connection object, calling ".Close" on it should do the trick. If that doesn't work, we'd need to see the code where you connect to the DB to have more info...
Can you elaborate on the errors you're receiving?
It should all be doable without requiring admin rights on the machine, but you would need to do the following: call reg.exe to write a registry value at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced The item there you need to set a value for is HideIcons. Value of 0 means icons are visible, and value of 1 means icons are hidden. So you want to set it to 1. However this won't automatically refresh the desktop. You would need to also call taskkill to kill explorer.exe, and then relaunch explorer.exe, which would reload the explorer interface, but with the icons now hidden because the value from the registry will now be used. You would set the reg key back to 0 and rekill/load explorer.exe again to bring it back to normal.
can you put that into a formatted script?
I gave you all the pieces you need, but not, I don't have time to write out your fake virus for you. You should be able to google around and figure it out.
Lol it’s unbelievable isn’t it?
"Script Kiddies". I am sure whatever they already have is just a copy/paste of various things they found on the web.
No, because Visual Basic isn’t a scripting language. And another no because this sub is for people with serious problems, not script kiddies that can’t even do their own homework.
Write yourself a snipping tool while you’re at it too!
Double click on your checkbox control to generate an event handler. Inside of your method body write picturebox.visible = checkbox.checked. Or just copy. Private sub CheckChanged(sender as Object, e as EventArgs) handles CheckBox.Changed Picturebox.Visible = CheckBox.Checked End Sub Have not touched VB in about a year and am nowhere near a computer, so there might be an error or two. I would look at the API for the proper event and state name, but I’m too lazy.
Instead of using more memory than needed how about you use CallByName? It takes a string parameter of your function or method name and invokes it.
Yes. There is a method for settings a control font and size. Literally type in “font” in MSDN.
You can change it in the registery. And then refresh the desktop i think. Or restart explorer.exe.
Username checks out.
Oh, that's a cool problem. Here's a basic solution: Create a form, add a PictureBox and a WebBrowser control. In the code, use this: Public Class Form1 Private Declare Function PrintWindow Lib "user32.dll" (ByVal hwnd As IntPtr, ByVal hdcBlt As IntPtr, ByVal nFlags As UInt32) As Boolean Public Function CaptureWindow(ctl As Control) As Bitmap Dim bmp = New Bitmap(ctl.ClientRectangle.Width, ctl.ClientRectangle.Height) Using gr = Graphics.FromImage(bmp) Dim hDC = gr.GetHdc() Try PrintWindow(ctl.Handle, hDC, 0) Finally gr.ReleaseHdc(hDC) End Try End Using Return bmp End Function Private Sub WebBrowser1_DocumentCompleted(sender As Object, e As WebBrowserDocumentCompletedEventArgs) Handles WebBrowser1.DocumentCompleted Dim bm = CaptureWindow(WebBrowser1) bm.RotateFlip(RotateFlipType.Rotate180FlipY) PictureBox1.Image = bm End Sub End Class Put a value in the WebBrowser1.URL property and run... [Example result...](https://i.imgur.com/PHLhLnS.png) 
Awesome! Thank you so much!

Man, ODBC, that brings back memories (though faint) &amp;#x200B; I dug up [this](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/0def3d91-3f0a-4cb4-a574-62cf39a31e71/error-opeing-dbase-datacould-not-find-installable-isam?forum=vstsdb) because if I recall correctly it is a driver issue, and just because the ODBC Admin panel says you connect goes not neccesarily mean it does. I'd also consider a testbed in whatever language you want and using the connection string from [https://www.connectionstrings.com/](https://www.connectionstrings.com/) to insure that the driver is working on that level. &amp;#x200B;
Do you have a database of questions and answers? If so it's a simple sql statement to get them in a random order. 
most DBs have a random function. check the docs. you'll need to be more specific for more specific help
Thanks, I'll give those other drivers a shot in the morning when I get back in the office. Unfortunately, with regards to connection strings - we have none in the software at all. We just use the OpenDatabase call with a folder and the dbase identifier. Redoing the database calls across the entire suite is unrealistic, but if I can get *something* working, I'd be happy just to get it going 
I'm assuming this is SQL server and if so it's just ORDER BY NEWID() at the end of your select
I would do your running total as a function rather than a sub so you can pass the current total to the function then add you new numbers to it. 
 intNumber1 = txtNumber1.Text intNumber2 = txtNumber2.Text intNumber3 = txtNumber3.Text intTotal = intNumber1 + intNumber2 + intNumber3 intRunningTotall += intTotal You didn't actually update it. 
`1 = Cdbl(inputbox(x, y)) ` That’s how I would write it without Visual Studio and the code behind for your procedure. 
I'd rather encourage good question asking vs making assumptions.
We still have dBase running in our company, although we are just about to replace it. Currently, all of our office workers have newer Win 10 64-bit PCs. In order to work with dBase, we had to install VirtualBox and give each of the users a virtual Windows XP. This is temporary though, as we have built and are now testing our new replacement application. &amp;#x200B; Our situation is probably a lot different from yours, so this may not be the fix you need. But, if newer computers and OS's are the problem, you can try VM's as a last resort.
So I'm not a VBA guru (VB.net is my experience) but doing something like this, even in VB.net isn't exactly easy. However, a quick google search of vba searchable drop down list pull up a ton of results. I looked at a few and it looks like they have pretty good information on how to do it. 
I agree, which is why my comment to OP was doing so. Trying to get more info to help them help themselves :)
Yea I've been playing with it at work. Certainly isn't easy. I mean it works in a quick and dirty way kind of way. But attempting to refine and make the final document look professional as well as function as I intend is the problem. Grinding away today working on it though.
Can you elaborate on the use case you're trying to solve. Like what is the problem in layman's terms? I might be able to help you come up with a different solution
Sure I can try : ) I have a excel form that I enter quantities of, description, model number etc and use a sum button that creates the form for printing for stocklisting purposes. This has been used for many years. But we are having issue with people splitting up what we order when it has to go out to different vendors. What I want to accomplish is to have a drop down box in a row, that will pull all of the information associated with that row, if the vendor is selected as "example". And then create a list for every vendor that is selected. If you message me your email I will be glad to send you both documents so you can see what I am trying to accomplish.
Sent it. Is a win forms app out of the question? The reason I ask is I've seen things like this time and time again in my line of work, and these inevitably end up getting too complicated for excel. Not that I would recommend this route but I get sometimes things in the real world aren't idea, but it might be worth trying to do this over in an access database
I emailed you the excel documents. Thanks for getting back to me. Yes I understand completely, and I know there are multiple ways to accomplish what we are attempting to do here. Hoping I guess that we can do so with what we already have going.
okay. I'm sorry I was panicking when I wrote this. I'm using the SQL Tools in Visual Studio 2017 how do I connect the radio buttons to A B and C Options?

&gt;I'm using VB6 in windows 10 My condolences. I'm just guessing here because of the incomplete code, but in VB6 all parameters are passed by reference by default, so changing the parameter in a method will also affect the outside variable that was passed into the method. See `ByVal` and `ByRef`.
I'm planning on finally learning C#, I swear. I'm not saying you're wrong, because I don't know any better, but if the variable were to change when the parameter does, wouldn't I be running into same issue the first time around when it's creating the caves for the first map, using identical code, both subs using the same parameters, making a call to the same sub for creating the caves maps? The parameters also aren't ever changed. They're just referenced.
Nevermind, I think you just solved my issue. This was super obvious and I was just otherthinking it. Thank you sir.
If it's too much, can you guys help me with randomizing forms without repetitions instead?
Sorry for the late response. but thank you for this! you saved my life! THANK YOU!
I don't really use vb.net much at all, I'm sure there's a tutorial for that in general, to randomize without repetition, you have to either remove the item from the source list when it's picked, or check for a repeat and pick another. 
can you show me how? I don't know how. please, I'm desperate.
again, I don't really use vb.net. my VB use is in maintaining old crap. vb6 and vbscript I also can't help you with your elearn course because i have no idea what you've been taught and what techniques you're expected to use. there's a easily a dozen different ways to do this, most of which will be glaringly obvious to whoever's scoring you that you didn't do it yourself. to get homework help, you need to absolutely specific, and share the code you have in a formatted text form, not just screen shots
okay. so I scrapped the database idea, and just made a quiz with multiple forms. since I don't have a database, I want to randomize the order of the form load every time the user clicks the next button. that's all I need now. randomizing form loads. &amp;#x200B;
Office uses "Visual Basic for Applications", which is a watered-down version of VB focused on Excel/Word objects but minimal Classes implementation otherwise. 
You have 'Do' and 'Do While' and only one 'Loop'. Either remove the first 'Do' because it seems pointless or and another 'Loop'.
I never write DO loops, only FORs. But shouldn’t there be an end to the loop in the tabbed section? So a LOOP after the last tabbed line?
I'm not familiar with that software but it doesn't have its own ide? It looks like something super proprietary. If you know python then you'll be fine, it'll just be a matter of googling syntax. As far as editors visual studio or vs code as your best bets. Generally vb would be ran in a Windows environment yes but the latest shift you .net core is open source and cross platform so you could technically run it in a Linux environment. However since you're dealing with legacy code, if strongly recommend a Windows environment
If we assume you wanted two Do loops, and use indentation to determine what would be in them..... 1. You have a Do at the top and a Loop at the bottom, but no condition on when that loop should end. This is an infinite loop. 2. Above your If statement you have a Do While (with condition) but no Loop below your End statement. You need to add a Loop below the End statement. If you only want one Do loop, you need to get rid of one of the Do's and make sure the Loop statement is in the right place.
What do you mean by custom controls? Like you want to make your own textbox item or something? I've done some related things and if you're going like from the ground up you'd basically create a new "control" class that inherits the system.controls class (not sure on the full path there). However, if you have a specific use case, then it might make a lot more sense to inherit off of a specific control. A good example for me was creating my own DataGridColumn control that inherited off of the base one. But I added a property you could set to true for filter is dropdown and when you did that, my custom stuff (that ran on top of the regular grid column) would loop through all of that columns data, get unique values, and then add a dropdown in the filter pane that was a list of unique values for a specific column. [This is what it ends up looking like.](https://i.imgur.com/FDtWe9W.gif) The nice thing is someone coding just sets FilterIsDropdown="true" in the tag and they get the dropdown filter. I want to note this was a hell of a lot of work. Also, it's in web forms, but would translate to win forms probably fairly easily. Generally speaking you don't want to do that if you can get away with using what is already built, but if you're just doing it for a side project to learn I can get that. If you can give some more info I can see if I can help.
Actually your control looks very much what I would like to achieve, creating a nested hierarchy but with the ability to drag and drop its elements to reorder. Basically what I am trying to achieve is to show a set of projects, their sub projects, their own sub projects, etc until you come to the tasks. But I want to be able move a subproject to the top of the hierarchy to become its own project. I can handle the xml details of what is and isn't a child of what, but I haven't been able to find a control that would have that intuitive functionality. I've been playing with the list box to drag things around to reorder and have successfully found one example that works and I can adapt, but its damned ugly and not very intuitive for the user. 
Do you have any sort of budget for this? There are some paid controls out there that would be a huge help here? Otherwise I would google around for .net treeview controls. That's probably going to be your best bet. 
you generate a random number and add logic to load a form depending on the number generated. 
No budget I'm afraid. And I have this nasty habit of wanting to do things on my own to learn how it works. But that might be from embedded systems programming :). Thank you for the term though, I'll take a look through for some. I did find syncfusions community license, though nothing really seemed to match my needs. 
I get the no budget thing. If you get started on something and have questions hit me up. I have more vb experience than it is healthy to have
Not proprietary at all, at least the area's I want to work with. The IDE it comes with is super painful. It doesn't save all the time and crashes constantly. Thanks for notes on the editors, I'll give them a look
Thanks man :)
You could take an array of all your forms, shuffle that array and then go through the array showing the forms one by one.
If you want to see more VB-centric news on InfoQ let me know.
Arrays and Lists are two different things. Lists can have multiple data types, arrays are limited to the same data type. &amp;#x200B; To create an array: &amp;#x200B; Dim array() as integer = (3,4,5,6,1) &amp;#x200B; To access each item in the array you need to use this following line: &amp;#x200B; array\[0\] or array\[1\] array\[2\] etc.
Unfortunately, I feel like the state of local speech recognition is very poor right now for the .NET coder. A *lot* of modern work has gone into cloud services, including Microsoft's own Bing/Cortana speech APIs, so good old fashioned System.Speech has been left to rot. It's a big part of why my home automation/personal assistant application is still missing speech recognition. If you find something, let me know!
According to the website, Mach3 uses *VBScript*, which is a little different of a beast, and I swear is primarily used to write malware these days. ;) VBScript, like VBA, is closer to classic Visual Basic 6 than the more modern Visual Basic .NET, but most of the core concepts are similar.
Thanks a bunch for the reply! That helps a lot believe it or not! I'll do some digging for a book on VB script then.
Thanks, Anyway I could do it so that I have a list, so that list(0) is an array(8,8) etc. or would I have to find another way around, just it seems to me that it should be possible but I can’t think of the syntax to do it
You could have an array of arrays? Array = ( [0,1],[2,3],[4,5]) Can VB do that? I used to do that in flash
Yes you can, they’re called jagged arrays if you’re interested but their initialisation and adding values seems cluttered imo. Fortunately found another solution to my problem (turns out an extra set of brackets was ruining my assignment of values). For anyone else interested this is how you do it: Dim List1 As New List(Of T(,)) Then to reference each index: List1(indexOfList)(IndexOfArray, IndexOfArray) Thanks anyway though!
If your array is that of integers: Dim arrList as New List(Of Integer(,)) This should work.
This is the correct answer. For OP's 2nd question: To reference an array from the list, you can do: arrList(5)(2,4) = ... 
Thank you both of you, turns out I’d got an extra set of brackets around it ( I was doing arrlist((5)(2,4)) for some stupid reason). Code is working fine now though :)
&gt; Arrays and Lists are two different things. &gt; &gt; Lists can have multiple data types, arrays are limited to the same data type. If your List is "typed" (ie, Dim lst as List(Of Integer)) then it can only have that one type. You can have a List(Of Object) that will let you put anything in it, but then you can also have an array of objects that will also let you put anything you want in it... Dim objArr(2) As Object objArr(0) = 123 objArr(1) = "hi!" objArr(2) = New Button With {.Text = "I'm a button"} Lists can be seen as "convenient" arrays, as the .Net library will take care of resizing them as needed to accommodate what you put into them, but if you look at the .Net sources, Lists are implemented using arrays internally. 
 I would try this: If checkbox.checked = false then property.visible= false But I'm only a beginner so don't be too harsh on me people of the internet 🙈
thank you! I will try this tonight 😁 my professor hasn’t answered any of emails so far this semester so I have a feeling I’ll be on here for any advice I can get!!! 
You can simplify this further by just doing &gt;property.visible = checkbox.checked Both of those properties are boolean values. cc: /u/clarinetwithascope 
Adding to this if a property is a boolean value you dint have to compare it to true or false, it already is one. You could do your if statement like this: If checkbox.checked then Label.visible=true Else Label.visible=false End if There is no need to see if true=true. Or the same think in another way: If not checkbox.checked then Label.visible=false Else Label.visible =true End if The 'not' turns the false into a true instead of getting the true by doing the comparison of false=false 
Thank you, where in the code do I put this? Under the form? (Sorry Im VERY new to this) 
Thank you so much! Do I put this in the code, under the form? Or under the checkbox_click? 
Depends on where you're referencing the value of the checkbox to determine the visibility of the labels.
I put it under the checkbox click action and it worked! Thank you everyone for your help it means a lot 
I am not familiar with Mqtt but hopefully this resource helps http://converter.telerik.com
Thanks, Tim! I will give it a try with one of the examples. I was already going to try a converter someone else had suggested, as well. Better than nothing :)
You need to think about what event you want to trigger the check. Do you want it to check the status of the checkbox and update the label each time the checkbox is clicked or only once when the form loads?
UPDATE: the preparation for the Controls are getting an optional detour :) I map/program these via BMT (with help of Steve for some of the script) the point is the readout in 1single loop speeds of 4trains controller via turnknobs/faders (the row of fader below the first will be used as Forward/Reverse status) this already works for 1 train simultanious, same issues as before sadly the current PC software doesn't allow to free map more control per train :( currently only 1 train at a time :/ wrote the programmers of the original software months ago to add a mapping tool, but no response! https://youtu.be/mceeRCe5s9M I no this is different from the RAILDRIVER and i'm still going for that, but this can be used on ANY midi device so if we can get this working many people could benefit thus they don't have to buy expensive 3rd party stuff :)
I work in both so if it doesn't translate exactly correct post what c# you're trying to convert and I'll see if I can help
&gt; Xpressnet My current track on this is to write a class that converts the x-keys information which will provide our interface to the controller, into commands that expressnet understands via this library. http://xpressnetlib.brozek.org/ The only part I am missing is how we get the commands out from the pc to the z21 white version. More research needed.... I have a high level object block for the interlaces for modification of input and display. An interesting side effect of this is the program to send the expressnet commands, can be visual on the pc interface and also support external inputs from the controller. Just extrapolating this out from my original application.
Thanks! I had a code snippet from someone who did something similar in a console app, so I'm figuring out what to do for a Windows Form app. Making progress. I'll let you know how it goes
Posting your code will help.
Make a launch page and have everything with the database connection later. When backing up close everything else fire off the process in the background then reopen the database Or learn to close the connections
Usually how I do cell colorization formatting is create a Sub that loops through the entire datagridview and does the colorization based on the values of your data. You need to put your Cell Colorization in a Sub or Function by itself and then make the call to it in your cell formatting, or whenever the data is changed ( your timer\_tick). Other things, if you have sorting enabled on your datagridview you will have to call the cell coloring sub again anytime it's sorted. Or in my usual cases I'm reloading alot of different data grids on different tab pages, and I usually have to call my color sub when I change tab pages. `Private Sub tbMain_SelectedIndexChanged(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles tbMain.SelectedIndexChanged` `Select Case` [`tbMain.SelectedTab.Name`](https://tbMain.SelectedTab.Name) `Case "tpEmployee"` `CtlEmployee1.CountandPaint()` `Case "tpCalls"` `CtlCall1.PaintRows()` `Case "tpCompensation"` `CtlClientCompensation1.ColorAndCountPartners()` `End Select` &amp;#x200B;
can you not make the data load and formatting into its own function and call that from both places?
Thank you. I'll give this a shot when I'm back at the office. As of right now I just have my formatting in the cell_formatting event.
Thanks for the suggestion, I don't know why this is giving me so much trouble. I normally am connecting to a SQL Server and can open and close connections no problem but this app is using the Add&gt;SQL LocalDB File and it connects as soon as the app is launched, I never had to add any sub making the connection so I'm not sure where it is doing that.
What are both places you're referring to? The button click event and the timer tick event?
yes
You're very close. The problem is the part where you do "If word = "a" or..."; you're comparing the whole word to "a" then to "e" and so on. So it will only work if the word is one letter long. You need to go over each letter of the word. If you've seen "for loops" and how to extract letters from a string in class (hopefully you have), you can refer to that to fix it.
You will want to increment through every letter in the word that is read in probably using a For loop. Get the length of the word variable. Dim strLen As Integer strLen = word.Length For index As Integer = 1 To strLen If word[index] = "a" Or word[index] = "e" Then lettercount++ End If Next Not sure how to format code on here sorry. Also I don't know if the syntax is correct in anything I wrote, but this should give you an idea. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/statements/for-next-statement
Messagebox.show("it worked now")

Does the form actually load? If this form isn't called from another, check your application settings and make sure Form1 is the Startup Object.
You can even make the letters the counter in their loop, such as: For each letter in Word If letter =“a” or letter=“b” VowelCounter ++ End if Next 
sounds wicked so excited to hear from, dunno i feel like a kid waiting christmas morning XD seriously appreciate the effort, have no idea where else to look! i'm actually a very poor guy (you prolly won't expect) actually, but i do own a almost 1600+ modeltrain FB group. so i'm certain that if the endresult can be used by many of them for sure a donation via paypal or crypto can be arranged... 
Is this winforms or WPF? Off-hand I remember using form.Initialized and form.Loaded events in WPF. I don’t remember what I did for winforms as I’ve mostly migrated away from it. I’ve also made and called a publicly exposed sub when calling a form from another form or even from a main method, in order to initialize the form. 
additional question: how do i reset this? in case another student will play the game again? 
In visualstudio go to your application property's and make sure Form1 is your startup form. Also the command msgbox doesn't work and should be messagebox.show("*")
Dim Result1 = textbox1.text + textbox2.text Dim Result2 = textbox1.text + textbox3.text Dim Result3 = textbox2.text + textbox3.text Dim Result = Result1 + Result2 + Result3 TextboxResult.text = Result
I would start looking at arrays, dictionary for recipes, and lists. C# is going to be much more friendly when it comes to data oriented programming.
You need to add a button and then do it in the on click event. Look up connecting to database visual basic
You can simply clear the tags before opening the new form: Button1.Tag = Nothing Button2.Tag = Nothing Button3.Tag = Nothing MsgBox("Open your form here!") 
VB6 is 20 years old and doesn't like 64-bit systems. If there a reason you're using VB6 instead of the Visual Studio Community Edition?
Wait sorry are you asking why i use vb6?
[removed]
Oh i need it for school, its required
There are two routes that I can think of: 1. Recommended method -- use a virtual machine with Windows XP or earlier. Ensure that the VM has zero connectivity to the Internet or it will likely get pwned, especially anything that pre-dates XP SP2. 2. There are several guides out there for getting VB6 to work under Windows 10 that should also apply to Windows 8.1. The downside of this method is that it will leave old, insecure components lying around in your OS directories.
Dang, thanks so much for the help. This is why I love reddit so much hahhaha. I hope you have a good day/night kind sir/maam
You bet! Is this your first programming class?
No built in support, but I've seen various small components/classes. &amp;#x200B; Browsers have a similar issue and so there are css options where it first determines if it's mobile or something else and then styles the webpage for the size of the screen, phone or desktop. &amp;#x200B; You could either look for a class/component online and download something written by someone else that will resize things for you to your satisfaction or else create something of your own. The real issue is the font size, I imagine, relative to the screen height/width - so it's two issues: first fit every control to the screen and second have every control's fontsize be larger or smaller as needed for that person's ability to see. &amp;#x200B; What I do is have a global variable for screen height and screen width, set to zero at the start. Whenever a form resizes, there is a message - you'd ignore the message every time the window size is equal to minimised or normal and only respond to it when it is in the maximised state. &amp;#x200B; And then when in the maximised state, you'd compare your global screen height/width variables to the current screen width/height. If both match, then continue to ignore, but if not, set the variables to the new screen height/width and then do resizings for everything. If the screen height/width never changes, this routine will only occur once, at startup, but if a user begins fiddling with the screen resolution, the next time they maximise, the resizing routine will set all the controls to whatever is the best fit. &amp;#x200B; There are more involved ways to do this, but let's say you base everything on height. You could assign a value of 1 to a height of 600 (800x600 screen) and a value of 1.28 to screen heights of 768 (1024x768) and so forth - it's just be a one line computation, current height /600 = ratio. &amp;#x200B; If you are dealing with mobile screens too, it would be a little more complicated, but it would still be a ratio. &amp;#x200B; And for every control when that resize routine activates, you'd determine the height by that ratio ...and you could do something similar with the width. &amp;#x200B; Or you could also just resize each control the entire time by a certain percent of the screen, so you don't even need a ratio. &amp;#x200B; In my routine I also generate a specific font size as well as a standard width and height ... and I have an option to override the font size (made available to users - something like a button that calls the common dialogue font window), and when that happens, the entire resize routine kicks in and resizes everything, bigger or smaller, to what the person indicates. So the entire screen is taken up with the controls regardless of screen height/width, but one person sets the fonts at 20 and the text inside all the controls is very large and someone else the next day sets it at 12 and it's smaller. &amp;#x200B; So at higher screen resolutions, for the people with difficulty seeing, you'd want to automatically (or offer the option) to increase the font size of everything as well ... and for those who don't want it, make font size smaller. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Yeah, hahhhahahahahah thanks again bro
Cheers. I figured it would be a bitch if they didn’t have a control in VS. I just figured there would have been one since widescreen and HD and 4 k became A thing
What you need is something that could be constantly doing something, checking something every \*\*time\*\*. And have the button switch between two states. When one state is \*\*true\*\* it would show one image, and if not it would show the other.
This is a terrifying question. 
Use the Background Image property of the Picturebox
Lmao 
I think the only limit is your dreams... That and maybe the memory of the computer
5,000 empty forms saved as one character 
&gt; In one of the rare cases where Windows sets a hard-coded upper limit on a resource, the Executive defines 16,777,216 (16*1024*1024) as the maximum number of handles a process can allocate. Every Window consumes a handle. In VB6 and WinForms, so do most interactive controls. https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/markrussinovich/2009/09/29/pushing-the-limits-of-windows-handles/
Isn’t that limit if they’re all open at once though? I interpreted OP’s question as “how many forms can a single project have” 
Looks like over a million. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3443524/is-there-any-limit-on-number-of-classes-that-a-namespace-can-have-in-net 
Because `Cursor` is just sitting there out in the open. I assume you've either chopped up the original code, or you copied someones code that wasn't working to begin with. You have an `End Function` without a `Function`. Everything under the `Public Declare Function` should be inside either a Function or a Sub (depending on what you expect to return). Also do you have `mouse_event` declared somewhere? Because if not you're going to have errors there as well. 
I don’t know about forms but I’ve maxed out VB6 projects in the past. 
To teach you how to find the answer. You will never learn all the code you need in class. They most useful skill in coding is how to find the correct answer when you are stumped.
And your sanity
Way back when I recall maxing out the number of controls on a form/window, (a medical application that had tabs to show the staff all areas of patient care via 1 click. However I never had that many forms to get an issue. Trying to think of how many forms max I may have used. I think less than 20.
5000 candles in the wind.
RIP Lil Sebastian
I asked on twitter, and they said there's no limit. [https://imgur.com/oQENIJb](https://imgur.com/oQENIJb)
I'm sorry! I was just curious. haha
Haven't done VBA for quite a while but it appears that in your code you're specifying UserLoginID but in your Users table you have UserName and Password. Maybe try this: If (IsNull(DLookup("UserName", "Users", "UserName ='" &amp; Me.txtLoginID.Value &amp; "'"))) Or _ (IsNull(DLookup("Password", "Users", "Password ='" &amp; Me.txtPassword.Value &amp; "'"))) Then MsgBox "Incorrect LoginID or Password" Else MsgBox "Login and Password correct" DoCmd.OpenForm "mainmenu" End If
That still doesn't make a difference. Although it does make the syntax disappear. If you want I could set up a TeamViewer and you could have a go at solving the issue. Thanks for the help.
You also have that code inside the txtLoginID_Click event. I would think that you would have a button on that form to click and the code should be contained inside its click event.
That seems to work as now when I click the Login button it runs the code. Although and error appears. It says "compile error. End if without block if"
You can post the updated code but somewhere you're either missing an End If or you have broken a line format that makes the compiler think you intended a block If statement (pretty sure this can happen if you forget to use the _ when breaking lines.

Remove the last End If (line 20) you have too many.
It works. 😊 thank you so much. 
Just to make sure, you want to see if a particular sheet is hidden or not?
Correct
I would think you could do something like: Private Sub Workbook_SheetActivate(ByVal Sh As Object) If Sh Is Sheet1 Then If Sheet3.Visible Then Sheet1.Range("A1").Select ActiveCell.Formula = "=b2+B3" Else Sheet1.Cells(1, 1) = "" End If End If End Sub In this example, the formula is located on Sheet1 in the upper left cell (A1). So we only perform this if we activate sheet1. The code then checks to see if Sheet3 is visible and if not it sets A1 to an empty string, otherwise it adds cells b2 and b3 together . 
Thank you, I understand the gist of what's going on here, I think I can use this to help implement my macro

It’s an OS function. Just use command prompt Move a_* b_* 
They are basically a block of code that can be called and used as many times as you want. If you find yourself constantly typing the same code over and over this is when you should move the code to a function or procedure. A function/procedure with parameters is more dynamic, for example a function that adds two numbers and returns the total, the parameters you would define for it could be num1 and num2, In your function you would add them then return the total. This means that when you call it all you have to do is supply the two numbers and you can use it again but use different numbers. Make sure you remember that when you are writing the function you define the PARAMETERS but when you call the function you pass ARGUMENTS to it, these terms can be easy to mix up.
Can you show me an example program your explaining the adding two numbers one with functions and parameters 
Not basing python, but this should probably take about the same amount of time to learn in vb
You're probably right but I had a source for doing exactly what they're looking for at my finger tips. And I've been trying to learn VB but been struggling. Meanwhile python has been somewhat fun to learn. It really just boils down to how many ways there are to skin a cat and the best one is whichever one is best for you
which vb? what features? what target platform (gui, asp, core)? most likely you're going to want to run windows in a virtual machine.
Yea just think of it this way, there could be a million reasons op has to do this in vb. Maybe he doesn't have python set up, then he had to learn how to get that running before he can even start. It'd be like if you asked a question in a python sub and someone said this would be easier in vb. Even if it's true it's not helpful to op. My preference is c# but I try to keep answered in here to vb. I know you were just trying to help though!
[This Website](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/vb.net/vb.net_functions.htm) Looks like it might be helpful. Clicking the next button will move one to Sub procedure. Both Functions and Subs take parameters (Arguments) the difference is that a Function returns a result. These arguments are meant to allow you to pass in values that would otherwise not be available inside that routine. For example, lets say you want to add two numbers and return the result from a function, the user input is received but the function will not know about these two values because of the scope of the variable (when done properly) So you send those two variables into the function (passing in the arguments) and the function can then use the user input values and perform the calculation and return the result back to the calling block of code. You should also take the time to read about variable scope as it will also help in working with variables inside functions and subs.
Those extensions are for Visual Basic 6 (or older). Pretty much everything Visual Studio related you'll find these days is about .NET, which is no help here. You'll have to find an ancient copy of the Visual Basic 6.0 IDE. No idea where you'd find one legally these days, but I'm assuming relevant google searches will bring up sources as well as the necessary incantations to get it running on a modern Windows OS.
Thanks. The company might have some copy of Visual Basic 6.0 IDE still in their inventory, I'm going to check it out. &amp;#x200B; In case they don't, how hard would it be to convert to .NET? Does VS have any "import" functionality available?
The ren command works for this on files in Windows, but it gives you an error if you try this on directories. For example, if I have a.txt and I run ren A* B* then a.txt changes to b.txt &amp;#x200B; However, If I have a folder named A\_test1 and I run ren A* B* I get "The syntax of the command is incorrect."
I think there was some kind of conversion ability, but I don't know if it's still available in modern Visual Studio and how well it actually worked, sorry.
Is the entire exe just the single BAS file or was that just where the change needed to be made and the project has other files like forms, classes, etc... A single BAS file is basically just a module in .NET so if it was just that one file, you could probably copy/paste it into .NET and not have too many syntax errors to fix and get it compiled on a modern platform. Otherwise you definitely will need the VB6 IDE to compile it. Early versions of .NET IDEs had a conversion utility for VB6 projects, but that has been gone for some time. So unless you have VS 2003 or 2005 (I don't remember if 2008 still had it), you won't be able to use the conversion utility (which honestly only worked decent for really simple projects).
I would first just focus on moving the directories, new or not to programming it is good to have a backup plan. Deleting the existing directory after the fact is easy and should be offered as an alternate method. Maybe the below example will be helpful. Keep in mind it is a rough draft, so it contains zero exception handling... or warranties. &amp;#x200B; `Sub Main()` `MoveDirs("E:\Visual Studio Testing\base\", "A_", "B_")` `Console.ReadLine()` `End Sub` `Private Sub MoveDirs(ByVal base As String, ByVal prefix As String, ByVal newPrefix As String)` `Dim dirs As String()` `Dim info As IO.DirectoryInfo` `Dim newDir As String` `dirs = IO.Directory.GetDirectories(base, prefix &amp; "*")` `Console.WriteLine("Number of directories: {0}", dirs.Count)` `For Each d In dirs` `info = New IO.DirectoryInfo(d)` `newDir = newPrefix &amp; info.Name.Substring(prefix.Length)` `Console.WriteLine("Directory {0} moving to {1}", info.Name, newDir)` `info.MoveTo(newDir)` `'info.Delete()` `Next` `End Sub`
Yes, it's really a single .bas file. In fact, it doesn't really have much "visual" to it. I mean, it's just a program that generates a bunch of files, daily. It does look pretty simple to my (untrainned in VB) eye. &amp;#x200B;
I worked on a project three years ago that was converting VB6 applications to the latest .NET version. We had to use Visual Studio 2005 to convert VB6 to .NET (then fiddle with the code to replace things like "left" and "right" with "substring" because that wasn't converted properly and to add the "handles" part of events because it wasn't added automatically), then VS2008 to bring it up to a later version of .NET, before we could use the latest VS we had to get it to the current version at the time. Being a single .bas file means it would certainly be a lot simpler, but there could be many things you'd have to do at the VS2005 level just to be able to get it to work in VS2008. If you can find the VB6 IDE you are still going to need to find any references and components the project has, all the .ocx and .oca and .dll files, and you're going to have to figure out where they belong on the computer you're installing the IDE on. Having installed VB6 on Windows versions up to 7, and assisting with installing it on Win10, I can tell you it's not going to be fun figuring out where they go, much less where to find them. The .vbp file will tell you what references and components it needs and where it's expecting them to live, but I found that it didn't list everything out perfectly, the IDE expects to find some things in the registry. Naming conventions have changed since then, so Office isn't necessarily where it was, or Windows directories. Lots of things tripped us in getting VB6 installed on Win10.
If you have an MSDN subscription you get all of the versions. The problem would be finding a place to install it.
If you have a modern copy of VS installed, you can create a new console app (or winforms app depending on what kind of visual output you want to have), and copy the code in. A very large amount of the VB6 syntax code base will compile just fine in .NET. There will more likely than not be SOME changes to make, but it should really be minimal.
TLDR; they're different languages.
I would definitely try this first.
Vb6 is still floating around in the usual places. Vb6 to .net is normally pretty easy on simple stuff. Most of the code had direct replacements however it really does depend on the usage From memory stream writer and system.io was pretty much the same functions just slight code changes. I’d be rewriting it to java or .net as vb6 is long dead and in expect win10 will cry at something eventually

The biggest difference for me is that much of the Microsoft documentation has examples in C# and not vb. Seems like they’re trying to force our hand, kinda like Apple with Swift. Would love to see both attempts fail. 
String.Split will accomplish what you're wanting if indeed this is vb.net, otherwise a loop and the Left &amp; Mid functions could be used in vb6. If you post some code, we can help you better.
Thank you!
In fairness, C# is vastly more popular than VB.Net. VB.Net had sort of fallen off the wayside as a hobbyist’s language rather than a leading choice. I say this as a predominantly VB.Net programmer
Regex
Yes, but part of that reason was that Microsoft focused so much on C#. The VB documentation was often an afterthought and they even occasionally made APIs that couldn't be used from VB. (I forget the details, but it had something to do with how you needed to implement a certain subclass in a MS Dynamics product.)
If you're lowest is the first element, your if statement is never true. Just move txtSolution.Text = sngLowest out of the loop. Same goes for your higher one. If the highest was first, your if is never true.
Wep, that was it. Thank you!
getFile just needs 2 string parameters and a Decimal one. It doesn't care that the parameters come from a tennisClub object. It's getting the properties, which are just strings and numbers.
Unless there is more code between your declaration and the call to getFile, the array is filled with blank tennisClub Objects. Since you used a structure instead of a class you have to create tennisClub objects and load them into the array. &amp;#x200B; DIM member1 as tennisClub member1.forename = "James" member1.surname = "Rose" member1.shotSpeed = 10.5 &amp;#x200B; members\[0\] = member1 &amp;#x200B; Also save yourself some trouble later; Your getFile function should take in a tennisClub object instead of passing each parameter. The reason for this is, if at a later date you add a property to your object, if you do it the way I mention you don't have to change the interface, which is a good thing to avoid.
This is what I changed it to but there is still errors in the call line. Public Class Form1 Structure tennisClub Dim forename As String Dim surname As String Dim shotSpeed As Decimal End Structure Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Dim members(10) As tennisClub Call getFile(forename, surname, shotSpeed) End Sub Private Sub getFile(ByRef forename, ByRef surname, ByRef shotSpeed) End Sub End Class
Visual Studio errors are usually really useful. Instead of treating them as a binary situation (error message = bad things) look at what the error message is. It should tell you what the issue is. In the Call, you need to reference the structure. These are properties of the structure, not stand-alone variables. Also I'm guessing you don't need ByRef. If you're just using the values (not changing them) then you don't need ByRef.
I've definitely used C# to VB converters a few times, Telerik's is alright, but it doesn't understand everything. If you can't get a piece of converted code to work, try searching for another C# to VB converter... you'll get different results probably, and can compare the results. I'm very interested in what you're doing here, particularly if you manage to do it without a NuGet package. I have a home automation software I write, where I try to keep everything as low level and dependency-free as possible, but I haven't worked with MQTT yet.
I had some family stuff that came up, so I am just now getting back to it. I did use the Nuget package, but any code I produce with it should work just fine if you manually import the library or if you want to replicate the library at a low level. Right now, I've got a demo in VB, will connect to the broker and retrieve the last message published to the topic and display it as a MsgBox, then it publishes its own message, which it then retrieves and displays in a msgbox. I was going to try to figure out why it stopped there instead of listening for more, as well as why it was grabbing the old message instead of just waiting for new ones.

Homework questions are tolerated, please be specific about the question as much a possible. Asking us to write it for you is not going to happen. We also reserve the right to not answer if we think you are just not trying.
Just an FYI: 'AND' and 'OR' are carry overs from VB. You should use 'ANDALSO' and 'ORELSE' instead. This allows short circuiting of the expressions.
You didn't post any code so I'm going out on a limb here with what it sounds like you're having an issue with. I think you just need to **Or** the Move DragDropEffect with the Copy. So as an example in your DoDragDrop method for the list box try ListBox1.DoDragDrop(myDataObject, DragDropEffects.Copy Or DragDropEffects.Move) Then inside your DragEnter method for the RTB set the Effect to the same: e.Effect = DragDropEffects.Copy Or DragDropEffects.Move If this assumption is incorrect, maybe post some relevant code.

Without source code, people here can't help you much. You need a hacker. The manufacturer has gone bankrupt? Maybe you could find the developer, maybe he has a copy of the source. Might be easier to develop a new app for your friends.
I don't believe you can bypass Show Desktop - but you can respond to it so that the effect is only temporary, for a second or two. &amp;#x200B; You ought to have access to the event of the window resize - any and all resizings. When the window minimises (which is usually what happens to all other windows when the Show Desktop command is used), you should simply be able to issue a window resize to restore the windows to normal (or maximised) state. You may want to have a timer that waits a few seconds because other windows getting minimised may use up resources for a second or so and if your window popped up immediately, something might hang or not respond on some systems. &amp;#x200B; I am assuming that your widget doesn't have a normal minimise feature. Unless I'm mistaken, those widgets were normally on the screen and either they were running or else they were not running ... they didn't even show up in the app bar (that's the bar usually at the bottom - the start button on the left, and the list of applications and the time and system tray to the right). Assuming this is true, the only time when the window for your widget would ever be minimised is when the Show Desktop actives (or something else from outside your program that targets the window in a similar fashion). &amp;#x200B; If your window does have a minimise feature, you'd need to distinguish between someone pressing the minimise button at the top right (or wherever yours is located) in the non-client area versus a minimise without that button pressed. And if it shows up in the app bar, that's something else to distinguish because there is a right click menu option (available for all windows) that lets you minimise. But distinguishing all that is a bit more complicated and I'd probably just not permit the minimising feature. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
You should not bypass "Show Desktop". If the user wants to see the desktop, Windows should show him the desktop and not your app.
But the point of this is to see something(clock for example) when he looks at desktop. Just like the android widgets. 
You can get around that in the form's Resize event. Just add code to check if the form is minimized. If it is then set the window to a normal state and it'll appear again. It should be so quick the user won't even notice it. This is the safest way to tackle your issue. You may need to toggle Topmost on the form before and after putting the window back to its usual state.
Even less, one website as I linked in another of my replies.
Two problems with that 1. If I disable showintaskbar and set borderstyle to none it wont work which is necessary for me 2. There is an animation when it brings itself back
I didn't realize you were using a borderless form, which doesn't actually minimize. Here is what you are looking for. Tread carefully: Public Class Form1 Private Declare Auto Function FindWindow Lib "user32.dll" (ByVal lpWindowClass As String, ByVal lpWindowName As String) As IntPtr Private Declare Auto Function FindWindowEx Lib "user32.dll" (ByVal parentHandle As IntPtr, ByVal childAfter As IntPtr, ByVal className As String, ByVal windowTitle As String) As IntPtr Private Declare Auto Function SetWindowLong Lib "user32.dll" (ByVal hWnd As IntPtr, ByVal nIndex As Integer, ByVal dwNewLong As IntPtr) As Integer Const GWL_HWNDPARENT As Integer = -8 Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load Dim hprog As IntPtr = FindWindowEx(FindWindowEx(FindWindow("Progman", "Program Manager"), IntPtr.Zero, "SHELLDLL_DefView", ""), IntPtr.Zero, "SysListView32", "FolderView") SetWindowLong(Handle, GWL_HWNDPARENT, hprog) End Sub End Class &amp;#x200B;
Thanks a lot man its working, but there is a small problem. If I click show desktop button again to show programs, my form is in the front and it is supposed to be in the back. Is there any way to detect when the show desktop is pressed the second time so I can put it in the back?
Well the code provided isn't detecting when the show desktop button is pressed. It's changing the forms parent. &amp;#x200B; What you could do is put a timer on the form that is continually ticking away (say once a second or so) and setting your form to the background.
Please put your code into a codeblock or stick it on pastebin or something to make it legible :)

Thanks for updating your post with the pastebin link. I think you should get rid of the unformatted code, most people will just scroll through it and consider it a nuisance. &amp;#x200B; First I would like to ask this question: is your character supposed to be tied to the "grid". &amp;#x200B; I'm asking, because your method moves him by an amount of pixels, and not toward a fixed spot.

I can probably help a bit, but only during the evenings, so if I end up helping you you'll have to be patient with me.
Open your project properties, and select resources. Then drag and drop your images. The resource name will be based on the file name. 
Go to.the Project menu. Select the project properties, click on Resources and then Add file. You should browse and select the files you wish to add. A copy of them will automatically be put in a resources folder within your project.
Thanks for your response. I already have imported 66 images but i would like to let the user of my app import images and use them if they want. So this has to be done programmatically. Is there any other way to handle images in addition to what is already there imported by me (the programmer)? Thanks!
I think you have to make dummies and then replace the resource doing it embedded. Your better to make a custom images folder for it. That’s how most of the games do it
So you want the user to add to new resources each time that will be in resources automatically the next time they run the program?
yes that is what i was thinking. Is that how everyone manage images? or should I create a folder in the %appdata% of the user running the application and store them there. I am wondering how everyone handles images cause I can't find solutions to managing my.resources section. Thanks for your input. It has been informative
that was my last resort. I wanted to put this question here and see how people handle images. It is hard to think that visual studio gives you a resources area and not provide information on how to manage it well. Thanks for your help and info. 
some people use the java upload function converting the image to codebase 64. Check this solution it may help you. &amp;#x200B; https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34972072/how-to-send-image-to-server-with-http-post-in-javascript-and-store-base64-in-mon
Resources in this form are actually compiled into the exe or dll is editing it effectively means rewriting the exe which is open and would require an internal compiler. It’s main use is for resources that are statically part of the ui. By wanting to dynamically change it you really have to go the path of making base files and overwriting and reloading assets or if you are talking something like a character portrait or a image gallery driven by a user you need to create a data source which in this case would be a sprites/images folder or if you go more Db based blobs. 
that makes total sense now. I think stock photos is fine but going forward, i will create a folder and import images there. Thanks so much for explaining what my.resources purpose is. i am also familiar with blobs but didn't want to add a database locally nor cloud cause i want this application to be stand alone and small. Thanks again!
https://youtu.be/cxM_otRgFC8 SQLite may be your friend. Mongo or nosql May also as they live in the unity games world more I think
I dont think you can. The images you add at design time are part of the exe file. I dont think you can change that at runtime. You will have to make a folder and store the new images there. You could use a filepicker and copy the files selected into a folder for your program and then load them in to a listview each time the program is run so the user can see them.
Maybe a "dictionary" data type would be helpful. If you load the values into two dictionaries, you can then loop through them to determine if values exist or not. While loading, you can test to see if a value already exists (check for duplicates). Research dictionary objects to learn how to load them, loop through them, and check whether values exist. The following article discusses something similar: &amp;#x200B; [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21936044/checking-if-a-nested-dictionary-key-exists-in-vba](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21936044/checking-if-a-nested-dictionary-key-exists-in-vba)

It looks like you didn't declare your variables.
What is the actual text of the query that gets executed? Is this user defined table type actually a database object--or are you simply trying to use a table variable with your query?
Thanks for your reply! I have created in the database, in the User Defined Table Type, a table called dbo.compareTable, with a column called value_. I assumed when you create the parameter in visual basic and add it to the SQL command , it automatically declares my parameter "par" as an instance of compareTable, as it does with the other parameters you create. I must be missing a step here, unless you can't pass a Table Valued Parameter to a query, rather than a Stored Procedure. 
So you are saying that you need to round the percentage, put it in a text box, and add a % sign?
[Math.Round](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.math.round?view=netframework-4.7.2) is what you want to use, then just add a '&amp; "%"' to the end of it, without the single quotes of course. :)
Do you want it rounded or always dropped to 36? FormatPercet(num, 0) would round. Math.Floor(num) would drop it and then you just add &amp; "%" on the end
Let me break this down for you from the order of execution: Call the sub using the form as the first 'parent' control: `ClearTextBox(Me)` &amp;#x200B; Start looping through each control in the form: `For Each ctrl As Control In root.Controls` Call the ClearTextBox sub again on the current control *in case* this control has child controls as well (eg. group boxes): `ClearTextBox(ctrl)` Clear whatever textbox we've currently found either inside the form, or the current control `If TypeOf ctrl Is TextBox Then` `CType(ctrl, TextBox).Text = String.Empty` `End If` Move to the next control either in the form, or the current control that called it: `Next ctrl` If you have multiple controls that can contain textboxes you will end up with this running multiple times until every thing is cleared. Kind of like this: ClearTextBox(Me) Me ----&gt; Textbox Found (Cleared) Me ----&gt; Textbox Found (Cleared) Me ----&gt; Group Box With Child Controls Found (ClearTextBox(ctrl)) Group Box (ctrl) ----&gt; Textbox Found (Cleared) Group Box (ctrl) ----&gt; Textbox Found (Cleared) Me -----&gt; Textbox Found (Cleared) &amp;#x200B;
It’s a recursive loop. You give it a control (say for example, the form object). It then loops through all of the controls that are children of that object (the .controls property). It then calls itself with the name of the current control in the loop. After that loop is done, it checks if the control is a text box and empties it before moving onto the next control, before finally exiting back to the calling function.
Look into integer.tostring. One of the built in functions should do the trick for you. 
Thank you SO much! This all makes sense now, I spent the entire night reading left and right and especially the VB KB/Docs but all the examples provided there were a bit simpler (or different) than the example I'm using in my program. I just tried removing ClearTextBox(ctrl) and everything except the textboxes in the group box did clear out! My program did work but it just drove me nuts because I literally copy-pasted the code from my example as it was the final missing piece but I didn't understand exactly how/why it worked. I also found this variation of the above example yesterday and it uses Clear() and HasChildren instead but I believe it achieves the same thing or at least it has similar logic (have not tested it with my program): Private Sub ClearTextboxes(c As Control) Dim currentTextBox As TextBox 'Loop through all the controls.&gt;&gt; For Each ctrl As Control In c.Controls 'If the control is a TextBox do the next action.&gt;&gt; If TypeOf ctrl Is TextBox Then 'Convert the type of ctrl to a TextBox and assign 'it to "currentTextBox" currentTextBox = CType(ctrl, TextBox) 'Clear the current TextBox.&gt;&gt; currentTextBox.Clear() End If If ctrl.HasChildren Then ClearTextboxes(ctrl) End If Next End Sub Disclaimer: I'm a designer/marketer by trade and I've only tinkered with some Python so far as I found the syntax was simpler to understand but had to help someone out with VB tasks. All of this stuff is not easy but there's something weirdly gratifying once you get how a piece of code works. Many thanks once again! 
Thank you, that's exactly what was needed!
For what it's worth, the second example is more inline with how it should be done. This is because it doesn't call `ClearTextBoxes` for every single control it comes across, it will only do it if that control has other controls within it (children). &amp;#x200B; This is more how I would tackle it: Private Sub ClearTextboxes(Parent As Control) For Each Child As Control In Parent.Controls If TypeOf Child Is TextBox Then Child.Text = String.Empty ElseIf Child.HasChildren Then ClearTextboxes(Child) End If Next End Sub Not necessarily the naming convention I'd use, but for the sake of the example it will help understand who is who.

Well, your version is monumentally easier to grasp than the two I posted. Actually, the first one now seems kid of patchy/fragmented. It's what I imagined the flow would have been, i.e. for each -&gt; if it's a textbox -&gt; add an empty string -&gt; add an else in there to check for child controls or at least something of the sort. Do you mind if I use your version in my program? This is all strictly to be used for educational purposes/as an example. I can't thank you enough for this - if you know of any way I could order you a beer online knowing you can actually drink it, PM me.
Yeah mate no worries, do what you want with the code. It's all free source on here. No worries about the beer. Just happy I could help.
You should provide us with your code so we can see what has gone wrong.
If you are showing the second form using ShowDialog() then it returns a dialogresult value that you can look at to see what the result was. In your ok button code you set me.dialogresult to ok and in the panel button you set me.dialogresult to cancel so form1 can know how for form2 closed and run or not run code accordingly. Note setting the dialogresult property of a form will close the form for you so you don't need to call .close and you want to set the dialogresult as the last line of code in each button press.
Thank you, I think this will help me solve my problem.
The difference between show and showdialog is the latter will create the second form modally meaning form1 can't be interacted with until form2 closes. So it depends on your app if that is acceptable.

This error tells you that something is NULL, or in other words, doesn't have a value. By checking your locals window (at the bottom of the screen) you can see that the object newline is Nothing. I would check if your file line count is less than usercount, and maybe add an IF statement to check your result before attempting to use it.

I’ve never had that error before and I haven’t changed my code 
Alright, well let's work through this then. Put a break point on line 108 and check what value usercount has. Then tell me how many lines the CSV file has.
I agree with u/gerrib99, newline is null (nothing) after reading from the file. You can even see this in the bottom left of your image (newline value is "Nothing"). Your code assumes that the number of lines in your file matches "usercount". Something has gone wrong and your code does not handle the discrepancy. You should debug your code to understand how usercount became wrong in terms of the number of lines in your file. Then decide how to correct it. If the usercount SHOULD match the number of lines in your file, then you could read each line until you determine how many users there are instead of getting the way you are now. Example :[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16921080/read-a-file-line-by-line-with-vb-net](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16921080/read-a-file-line-by-line-with-vb-net) You could increment a counter each time you read a line (usercount += 1)
That’s what I’ve done. The main reason I’m confused is no changes have been made to my code. Once I am home I’ll try these fixes, thanks
Maybe your data file changed? Or maybe you’ve been logged in as an administrator account and now logged in as a regular user. Now your program may not have access to the data file. There are other things that can break besides code. 
Is the file you are reading opened by another application? Sometimes that will cause file open issues in VB
Couldn’t be that. It was in the same session that it started giving me the error
Nope, i specifically made it for this program
