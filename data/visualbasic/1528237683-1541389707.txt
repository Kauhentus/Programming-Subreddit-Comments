&gt; Yes you click lower if you think the card on the left is lower and higher if the card on the right is higher. But the card on the left is sometimes lower but it displays as incorrect. Ok, I deleted what I had because I re-read this: It doesn't make sense. Click the lower if you think the left is lower and high is you think the "RIGHT" is higher. if the right is higher, the left is lower and vice versa. Shouldn't it be based on one side or the other? I was under the impression that you saw the left card and you were stating that you thought this card was either higher or lower than the card being drawn. Then on a win, the draw card becomes the left card and you once again decide if you thing the next draw card is higher or lower than the left card.
Aces are high, they're both case 134, although this isn't actually my main problem [https://imgur.com/gallery/uWtY4pH](https://imgur.com/gallery/uWtY4pH) This is the code which is the problem, The button high code doesn't work.
[https://imgur.com/gallery/uWtY4pH](https://imgur.com/gallery/uWtY4pH) This is the main problem, the button high code just dosen't work
I've worded this wrong, If the card right is bigger than card left you should guess higher. if card left is bigger than card right you should guess lower.
probably have to parse the output
[https://imgur.com/gallery/uWtY4pH](https://imgur.com/gallery/uWtY4pH) This is the incorrect section
For the btnLow, you have If intcard1 &lt; intcard2 For btnHigh, you have If incard2 &gt; intcard1 They're basically checking the same thing. Swap the &gt; for a &lt; in btnHigh
Holy Shit you've actually fixed it, was this literally the problem the whole time?
Could very well be. Do you know how to use the Debug functions? You could have saved yourself hours of headache by simply stepping through the code line by line and checking the values. 
Wait now the lower buttons not working, the card on the right was 4 and the card on the left was 9 and I guessed lower but it was incorrect.
ok, but my statement still stands: if a &gt; b is the same as if b &lt; a which is in essence what you have written in those two if statements. if intCard1 &lt; intCard2 is the same as what you have further down if intCard2 &gt; intCard1. See what I mean, you're doing the same comparison. You need to base this off the right card as you described and compare based off the button clicked. By your statement if you click the high button then you would check: If intCard1 (left) &lt; intCard2 (right) then correct. then if you click the low button you would check: if intCard1 (left) &gt; intCard2 (right) then correct. 
I know I posted this but didn't realize I was answering a PM. So here is what I posted for clarity to anyone else reading this: ok, but my statement still stands: if a &gt; b is the same as if b &lt; a which is in essence what you have written in those two if statements. if intCard1 &lt; intCard2 is the same as what you have further down if intCard2 &gt; intCard1. See what I mean, you're doing the same comparison. You need to base this off the right card as you described and compare based off the button clicked. By your statement if you click the high button then you would check: If intCard1 (left) &lt; intCard2 (right) then correct. then if you click the low button you would check: if intCard1 (left) &gt; intCard2 (right) then correct. 
[https://imgur.com/gallery/a3cjr77](https://imgur.com/gallery/a3cjr77) Right I've changed this but now the lower button doesn't work properly, it tells me i'm wrong even if Card 1\&lt; Card 2
shouldn't intCard2 always be copied to intCard1? Because that's not what is happening. Let's say I see a Jack and I pick lower and the right card show an 8. I'm correct so then doesn't the 8 move to the left and I guess what the next card should be? If so, you don't have that logic in the High button click. You're saying intCard2 = intCard1 so right card is now = left and that gets changed by the random draw.
Yes it should, I actually just had my deadline so I handed it in about 10 minutes ago, I've never been interested in coding, I've always been more of a hardware person for computers, but hopefully it works well enough for a pass anyway.
Thank you for checking up! I don't know why the error is not occurred but I still appreciate it. I tried brintToFront but the form is covered in the next moment. I don't know why. But I found a better way. I can write Me.Focus() in the Form_Shown incident.
Yes, and that is where you should put the BringToFront() also as it ensures the form is fully loaded and visible to the user.
You Sir are looking for libgit2sharp it is a native implementation of the git protocol. https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2sharp/ You could take the compiled dll and include it in your vb project and use as is. 
Cool, I will take some time and play around with it. Thanks a lot!
Did they at the very least specify which version? VisualBasic.Net being the latest and greatest should be what you are working with but I've seen this is not always the case. Anyway, there's a link in the side bar "Visual Basic for Absolute Beginners" that is a great start for learning the basics.

You might get a better response in /r/vba 
Thank you!
I have been told I will be using visual basic for applications. That is all I know thus far
VBA is normally associated with another Microsoft product such as Excel, Word or Outlook and helps to help control those programs under the hood; though despite that you can still acheive an awful lot with it. Unfortunately you can't compile as an .exe so I would be interested to know what you are expected to do with it. Could you give a brief synopsis of a possible project you might need to complete. I maintain a pretty decent CRM built in VBA and also code VB.net so could possibly help a little.
Hey, Einsteinsdog, just a quick heads-up: **acheive** is actually spelled **achieve**. You can remember it by **i before e**. Have a nice day! ^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
VBA is a subset of Visual Basic, so be aware that when you start doing research that [VB.NET](https://VB.NET) and VBA are very different. You're going to need to know what you want to do before we can really help you since a programming language can do many, many things. If you don't have an idea yet for what use you want to do first. We can help once you have that 
You're probably going to be using VBA in Excel depending on what your PhD is on. PM me and I'll see if I can help you figure out what exactly you need.
Yes, VBA Book: https://books.goalkicker.com/VBABook/

I don't mind C#, but I can blurt out VB so much faster. Before .net 4 I liked to use C# for much 'precise' things, where the slightly misalignment of types or versioning SHOULD error and whine, but that's slowly eroded away in subtle little places. I now don't see C# as any more precise, just more punctuation heavy, which I could probably adapt to. Don't abandon vb, or I'll have to add it in myself!
You want us to do your exam questions for you? I can at least give you a hint. What you tried is not even remotely close to what you would need to do. You should look up string functions like split() to get started.
I figured that when I could type in 'fffff' and it would come out as 190 sentences
Can you add explanation? 
I mean, if you really don't want to figure it out on your own, you can easily google things like "counting words in a string vb.net" to get you some code samples.
I've asked some of my friends about their programs and they've said to count the length of the text for characters and count how many times that periods, exclamation marks, question marks and spaces occur for the other. I could probably get this done in a lesson. What do you think?
You can 'alias' another type, even built in ones. It can help if you later intend to make a real class, but for now, another type will do.
Thx
I had to do this for a program I was making. Took me about 90 seconds to google it. Granted, this guy is a beginner, but still. 
You're writing in a .Net language. Use .Net: Dim words as integer = textbox1.text.split(" ").count() Dim characters as integer = textbox1.text.ToCharArray.count() Sentences is going to take some logic work, as there are multiple types of punctuation. I'll leave that one to you.
You can get the current selected value of the combobox by accessing its .SelectedItem property from anywhere in your code. There's no need to 'connect' them. In your event handler for the button click, use a Select...Case statement to load the appropriate gif depending on the value of ComboBox1.SelectedItem (or whatever you named your cb).
Thanks man, this really helps. I managed to get a character counter working today but was still stuck on he others. I'm guessing the sentence counter would just include a ".", a "?" and a "!" instead of the " ". :)
For the sentence counter, take the same array from the character counter and iterate through it counting the number of punctuation marks. Dim characters As Array = TextBox1.Text.ToCharArray Dim sentenceCount As Integer = 0 For Each c As Char In characters If c = "." Or c = "?" Or c = "!" Then sentenceCount += 1 End If Next
Thanks again man!
What are you trying to do with this overall? You can use an [AutoFilter](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/quick-start-filter-data-by-using-an-autofilter-08647e19-11d1-42f6-b376-27b932e186e0) to apply a text filter with the conditions does not contain "Luxury" to have it only display rows that don't contain that word in the first column.
Hi I am trying to automate a process of stripping the data from a sheet, there are a lot of other parts to it to that leaves us with data that is then imported to access, problem is with users that miss a step or name sheets wrong. Plan is the browse to a downloaded excel file, click go and it strips the data, changes certain characters, saves the sheet in correct format and then opens Access and runs the import macro. All this would save the user an hour or so each day and save me having to go through it all to see what they forgot to do 😂 Cheers
Looks like the link you sent returns a JSON application string. Use a library like JSON.net to parse the string and get what you need.

I'm willing to bet its the 0. Whatever you are using to encrypt the data may be treating it as a null terminated string. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null-terminated_string
Hi sir/ma'am... I don't think so. As you've seen above, data IS (at least badly) encrypted/decrypted. Emmm cuz I am not native, so maybe you misunderstood. The second pic is not encrypted data. it is reconstructed(decrypted) after be encrypted, which is supposed to be same as the "before" one

Thanks so much. I think the first part might be wrong because an example of the first part I get with burp suite (networking tool) is 63373664663336382D363961332D343265392D393463662D653533666435383561613266. I'm pretty sure it has to be like only numbers/the letter D or something. Thanks again.
In the code you posted it's definitely A-F (65-70). But of course I have no idea if that code is actually correct.
Holy. Fucking. Shit. It works. This means so much. I will make sure to credit you LOL!
Does Switch_B only ever do one thing, and that is to toggle an image in a picturebox, you just want to be able to dynamically tell it which picturebox to toggle on/off?
No announcement yet, it still has the same WOW32 layer as windows 2016 so there is a good chance it will work
Yes, the file that the program reads determines which PictureBox should be toggled by the respective CheckBox control. What I have is a bunch of Switch CheckBox controls along with LED PictureBox controls, and the file determines which "switches" turn on/off the different "LEDs". So what I want to be able to do is create an event for the respective CheckBox/PictureBox combination at run time, when I read the file and figure out which controls are connected.
You'll have a lot better luck getting someone to help you if you ask questions to better understand the code examples rather than "plz do my homework".
This is actually not a homework, but you are right. I really tried but didnt have any luck. I will upload my attempt now.
nevermind i need god damn sleep im using a WPF project, those dont have timers. i sincerely hope nobody finds this
There are timers via the System.Timers.Timer class, they just aren't toolbox components in WPF.
VB isn't case sensitive. Your class **TravelInformation** and your variable **travelInformation** will conflict. Didn't cause an error, but it's also kind of confusing to have a property **classes** that could get confused with the data structure.
Also, classofService variable isn't instantiated declare it as a new ClassOfService, once you've renamed it
I just figured that out. Thanks!
I would use a refresh button. Second choice would be to place a timer on your form and call your refresh routine at intervals.
Yes, but I don't know the code to make such a routine. I don't know how to go about refreshing the data without closing and reopening.
Hello. I noticed that there was a typo in the assignment of PictureBox10 to tiles(8). This typo did not cause an error but it referenced something else, thus glitching the remaining tile assignments. Here is the correct code. Private Function gameboard() Dim tiles(84) As PictureBox tiles(0) = PictureBox2 tiles(1) = PictureBox3 tiles(2) = PictureBox4 tiles(3) = PictureBox5 tiles(4) = PictureBox6 tiles(5) = PictureBox7 tiles(6) = PictureBox8 tiles(7) = PictureBox9 tiles(8) = PictureBox10 tiles(9) = PictureBox11 tiles(10) = PictureBox12 tiles(11) = PictureBox13 tiles(12) = PictureBox14 tiles(13) = PictureBox15 tiles(14) = PictureBox16 tiles(15) = PictureBox17 tiles(16) = PictureBox18 tiles(17) = PictureBox19 tiles(18) = PictureBox20 tiles(19) = PictureBox21 tiles(20) = PictureBox22 tiles(21) = PictureBox23 tiles(22) = PictureBox24 tiles(23) = PictureBox25 tiles(24) = PictureBox26 tiles(25) = PictureBox27 tiles(26) = PictureBox28 tiles(27) = PictureBox29 tiles(28) = PictureBox30 tiles(29) = PictureBox31 tiles(30) = PictureBox32 tiles(31) = PictureBox33 tiles(32) = PictureBox34 tiles(33) = PictureBox35 tiles(34) = PictureBox36 tiles(35) = PictureBox37 tiles(36) = PictureBox38 tiles(37) = PictureBox39 tiles(38) = PictureBox40 tiles(39) = PictureBox41 tiles(40) = PictureBox42 tiles(41) = PictureBox43 tiles(42) = PictureBox44 tiles(43) = PictureBox45 tiles(44) = PictureBox46 tiles(45) = PictureBox47 tiles(46) = PictureBox48 tiles(47) = PictureBox49 tiles(48) = PictureBox50 tiles(49) = PictureBox51 tiles(50) = PictureBox52 tiles(51) = PictureBox53 tiles(52) = PictureBox54 tiles(53) = PictureBox55 tiles(54) = PictureBox56 tiles(55) = PictureBox57 tiles(56) = PictureBox58 tiles(57) = PictureBox59 tiles(58) = PictureBox60 tiles(59) = PictureBox61 tiles(60) = PictureBox62 tiles(61) = PictureBox63 tiles(62) = PictureBox64 tiles(63) = PictureBox65 tiles(64) = PictureBox66 tiles(65) = PictureBox67 tiles(66) = PictureBox68 tiles(67) = PictureBox69 tiles(68) = PictureBox70 tiles(69) = PictureBox71 '' OWO ME A CAT :3 tiles(70) = PictureBox72 tiles(71) = PictureBox73 tiles(72) = PictureBox74 tiles(73) = PictureBox75 tiles(74) = PictureBox76 tiles(75) = PictureBox77 tiles(76) = PictureBox78 tiles(77) = PictureBox79 tiles(78) = PictureBox80 tiles(79) = PictureBox81 tiles(80) = PictureBox82 tiles(81) = PictureBox83 tiles(82) = PictureBox84 tiles(83) = PictureBox85 tiles(84) = PictureBox86 For z = 0 To 84 tiles(z).Image = My.Resources.DiamondGem Next End Function 
When you write, compile, or run a Visual Basic application, the following types of errors can occur: 1. Design-time errors, which occur when you write an application in Visual Studio. 2. Compile-time errors, which occur when you compile an application in Visual Studio or at a command prompt. 3. Run-time errors, which occur when you run an application in Visual Studio or as a stand-alone executable file. For information about how to troubleshoot a specific error, see [Additional Resources for Visual Basic Programmers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/getting-started/additional-resources). ## Run Time Errors If a Visual Basic application tries to perform an action that the system can't execute, a run-time error occurs, and Visual Basic throws an Exception object. Visual Basic can generate custom errors of any data type, including Exception objects, by using the Throw statement. An application can identify the error by displaying the error number and message of a caught exception. If an error isn't caught, the application ends. The code can trap and examine run-time errors. If you enclose the code that produces the error in a Try block, you can catch any thrown error within a matching Catch block. For information about how to trap errors at run time and respond to them in your code, see [Try...Catch...Finally Statement](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/statements/try-catch-finally-statement). ## Compile Time Errors If the Visual Basic compiler encounters a problem in the code, a compile-time error occurs. In the Code Editor, you can easily identify which line of code caused the error because a wavy line appears under that line of code. The error message appears if you either point to the wavy underline or open the **Error List**, which also shows other messages. If an identifier has a wavy underline and a short underline appears under the rightmost character, you can generate a stub for the class, constructor, method, property, field or enum. For more information, see [Generate From Usage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/visual-csharp-intellisense#generate-from-usage). By resolving warnings from the Visual Basic compiler, you might be able to write code that runs faster and has fewer bugs. These warnings identify code that may cause errors when the application is run. For example, the compiler warns you if you try to invoke a member of an unassigned object variable, return from a function without setting the return value, or execute a Try block with errors in the logic to catch exceptions. For more information about warnings, including how to turn them on and off, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).
It’s kind of hard to tell, have you tried using the breakpoint debugging feature? This would be useful in this situation.
You could put it in its own sub and call that from each function.
Globalize the check and do once per startup by exposing the 3 objects checked. OR Do what /u/ViperSRT3g suggested and abstract this to a function called something like "checkObjects" 
What VB is this 6 or .NET for this is the most messed up way I have ever seen to instantiate controls. There are better ways to do both and I need the specific language to advise. 
&gt; Globalize the check and do once per startup by exposing the 3 objects checked. That sounds like what I need to do. How do I go about that? I tried searching for "exposing vba objects" but didn't see anything directly relevant. I'm pretty new to VBA
 Global SapGuiAuto as GetObject("SAPGUI") Global SAPapplication as SapGuiAuto.GetScriptingEngine I believe that's it. been a while since working in COM VB syntax. 
Does not work, errors on both lines (the second because the first doesn't work). Do you know any good tutorial or documentation on this topic?
Sorry forgot to include tag .NET
I have not but thank you, I will try this now
This comment is useless in the given circumstances.
I don't have enough info on what you are trying to do to help with the code of the box's. Your issue with the image load is the method in which you are selecting from the resource file. tile(x).image = My.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject("{object_name}")
Yeah that still didn't work, When I was copy and pasting picture boxes in design time I'm assuming it messed up something to do with the properties... Goodbye project
Hem what are you trying to do? Maybe we can come up with a better way.
I'm submitting my assignment tomorrow so I will not be able to get the randomisation of this complete, but It's only one mark so that's okay. Will love to keep talking to you to figure out what to do I have an array of pictureboxes as my game grid created in DESIGN time, and I want to randomly allocate gems throughout. As of current I was trying to get a gem on each picturebox but it only was placed in 9 of them and singularly declaring each one also doesn't work except to those 9 exceptions As in: tiles(51).image = my.resources.whatever doesn't actually put an image in there, but for 9 of the tiles(18), tiles(25) or so it does
I would suggest that in the future to do this use a single picture box and write a system that draws to the single picture box. Doing it the way you envisioned it is prone to problems.
Hmm I do know what you mean, so on code side rather than design I create one picture box and put a gem in it and then randomise its location rather than accessing them all?
That's the way I would do it. I would choose as size 32x32 pixels for example and I would make a board. Then I would grab the resource calculate a left, and top , and I would actually use 2 picture boxes, layered. Background one with the "board" that contains a single image with the board graphics. The second one would be a transparent image box overlaying the first this way you can add graphics on top with out having to go through the whole blitter process.
I believe if you make an excel template you can include the module as part of the template. When the user creates a new sheet from the template the module will come with it.
I would suggest that using the Vsphere automation sdk would be a better bet, you can then instantiate a copy of the vcenter management engine and use the info directly. https://github.com/vmware/vsphere-automation-sdk-.net
Oh man, that is awesome, I have never done anything with sdks like that, so looks like some googling is on the horizon. Thanks!
So you suggest I create picture boxes in code time/runtime etc rather than design time?
I suggest you use a single picture box as a canvas that you draw to, using the .net Graphics class https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.drawing.graphics.aspx Specifically you want to use the Graphics.DrawImage https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b829w21x.aspx You will want to use the Overload method that includes the x,y, width and height; https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dbsak4dc.aspx 
Its easy import the library into your project instantiate the object as normal. Once you have access to the class you can do some amazing automation. I wrote a snapshot controller that automatically created vm snapshots and specific changes to the underlying file system.
Hmm ok Even though the sdk seems to be c# I can add that to a vb.net program? 
Post the code you wrote.
yes, take the compiled DLL add to project as a library and you can interact directly. I use VB.NET with it.
ah man, this is a bigger project then i can handle. Thanks for all the help, think i am going to have to scrap this and move on. Thanks again :)
Ahh, I do understand what you mean How would I store the locations of these and register their individual clicks for the images? Would I put each image i draw in an array as I place it on the canvas at x,y location? How would I go about a click event
I would create a new class that stores the location of the game graphic. it would have the following properties top left width height picture I would add new method to the class that checks if the mouse is currently in the bounds of the object. This method would return true/false I would as another method called create, and another called destroy. I would also add a event for each of the mouse types I want to apply, Click will be the basic one. I personally would add an enter and exit event to the object. This way I could change the image on the enter and exit of the mouse. I would then use a collection of this new class and create a new copy of the object, set its properties, add it to the collection. Then call the create method from the object which process takes the picture you put into the picture property and paste it to the location provided in the properties. This way you can scale items, move them. Hell you could animate them by adding a collection of pictures to the object. Then on the click event of the picturebox that is housing the pasted images I would iterate the collection and pass it the x and y of the mouse and do a check via the method that returns the true/false for mouse in region. This is sounding more interesting the more I think about it. I will take a run at it and post some code. 
I'm actually understanding what you're saying, often in this subreddit people are very confusing when they explain things. Would be great to see some code
It's been 21 years man, just let it go.
Yes, you are right, but this is for new learner, who dont know about component. This will guide for beginner in VB learning.
I will start a new thread with this and include a link to this post.
You were employed by them at the time? If so, I highly doubt you have any legal leg to stand on, it depends on what if anything is specified in your employment agreement. 
No, you were employed by the company anything you do while working for them for there business whether it is tertiary or not is owned by them. 
Yes. I developed the program on my own and on my own time. I was brought in as GM so programming certainly is not part any job description. 
It is their property even though I developed it at home?
If you did not have a prearranged contract, or have signed a separate contract that allows you to do outside work all ownership is your employers. Get better armed with information next time, and make the deal ahead of time.
You need to check your states employment laws and the contract you signed when you were employed. But that said, because it is related to your business operation and is in place at that business before you had any sort of payment agreement, you probably have no legal rights to it, regardless of where you developed it. Think about if you went out and tried to sell it to a competitor. If it would be considered a conflict of interest, you're probably on a bad legal footing. Some good info here: [https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2016/12/09/developers-side-projects/](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2016/12/09/developers-side-projects/)
Wow. Thank you for that article. 
I see what you're saying and I agree. This isn't some huge deal that I'm going to try to push for money. After realizing how much of my personal time I've spent on it got me thinking about any potential financial benefits from it. That's why I started off by asking if it was even reasonable since I know I don't have a solid legal leg to stand on. Just wanted to hear other peoples thoughts. Thanks!
That said, specifics of a case might be best tested in court. If a lawyer will take it. And if the court recognizes its' validity. And if there's enough money in a settlement to pay for said lawyer plus give you a few bucks. 
Previous posters may be correct...that said, specifics of a case might be best tested in court. If a lawyer will take it on. And if the court recognizes its' validity. And if there's enough money in a settlement to pay for said lawyer plus give you a few bucks.
True. And you're correct about talking to a lawyer if I solid reasoning on why its mine and need paid for it. This is not some enterprise software or anything that I created. This is specifically for use at our company. I didn't realize how much better it could make things at work when I started on it so this wasn't anything that I was going to sit down and work up a developer contract with the owner beforehand. 
I agree with what was said above mostly. At this point, your best option is to talk to them and see if you can retain ownership of the software and extend them a perpetual license free of charge. You would then be able to market and sell the software to similar companies. Get a final agreement in writing. If you expect it to be extremely profitable, get a lawyer to review the contract. Worst case, you now have the knowledge to recreate such a system separate from the company. Get this agreement in writing and then recreate the system. I'm sure it will be better the second time around anyway.
Excellent input. Thank you 
&gt; Being a small company with a few employees and processes that don't jive well with the ERP Out of curiousity, is there just one module of the ERP that your firm is using? Why go through the pains of modifying business processes for a small sized company to work with an ERP that expects hundreds or even thousands of users? &gt; I wrote a program that quickly gives everyone the information they need to work throughout the day. Does your application create redundant data? Does the ERP allow you to access the data(base) or procedures via APIs? You know, to avoid recreating the wheel? &gt; Should the value be based on what it does for our daily operations or for how much time I have put into the program? First off, did you use any company assets to develop this? It can be anything from access to the internet, laptop, subscriptions, Skype/Outlook, books, resources (other employees, applications), etc.? In short, can the firm come back and say "They used X to make their software and we own rights to X, so technically that software is ours"? If your company's CTO/CIO don't have a strong culture of encouraging such behavior of going out of your way to help colleagues, it most likely won't be paid for by them either. At least that's my experience.

Nah.
- Homework questions are tolerated, please be specific about the question as much a possible. Asking us to write it for you is not going to happen. We also reserve the right to not answer if we think you are just not trying.
What are you trying to achieve by defining an event handler? Without context, it seems very... strange to formally define an abstract (see what I did there) part of a code pattern.
its for a school task 
Then no, it's not correct. Event handlers are methods that fire when an associated event is triggered. 
You could google the definition.
Not so much about is programming part of the job, many companies have a clause in the employment contract about anything you develop whilst employed by them is theirs to pursue or not. Usually with conditions spelled out. I know of a guy who invented a better interface for a gas pump and his company who made digital storage equipment took it patented it and sold the rights to another company. He got a bonus of like 10K they got several hundred thousand.
Sounds more like the definition of a driver. 
You're better off to go with Java. It's way better optimized for putting tones of graphics to the screen every frame. In VB you're looking at a horrible frame rate. I once tried to make a turn-based RTS in VB, even running at low-resolution the framerate was only 10 or less at best. Your results may vary for XNA, but you're going to be better off with a more graphic-friendly language either way. Unity would also be a good alternative.
Hmm, We're only allowed to use VB.net. I've seen some good stuff with XNA.
It might work with fewer zombies. If you only have to draw the background, the player, and a few enemies, you might get away with it in a very small view window, but you will definitely notice the chug. Maybe consider building it as a turn-based strategy game where framerate is not as big a deal.
Yeah I think you're right I have to run it on a school computer after all. Check out the game "Over 9000 Zombies". It was made with XNA and It has quite a few zombies and runs alright on my laptop. I will take that in consideration.
Some of the greatest games of all time were made with huge hardware limitations. Most players will forgive bugs and chugs if you give them a world they can get lost in, with cool decisions to make.
XNA is super dead, and never had really good support for VB.NET, but if you have the old toolsets and find some of the documentation for VB.NET, you might be able to get it all working. MonoGame is the logical replacement if you want to use an XNA style game engine, but VB.NET support is probably pretty thin, so you'd have to do a lot of work without much help. If you can understand C# you might be able to get things up and running in a C# sample and then rewrite the code in VB.NET. 
I have used monogame which is the succesor to XNA in VB without issue. I have coded with over 100k 2d objects without issue. http://www.monogame.net/ https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1175671/Getting-Started-with-MonoGame-using-Visual-Studio 
This is just not correct. Using monogame it is easy to get over 100k objects. Java is a terrible language for writing direct graphics hardware games.
Sounds like you were using forms or something, and not an actual game engine. 
JAVA may not be the best, but it's faster than VB. 
Oh wow. I haven't came across this. Did you experience a lack of support with monogame coupled with VB, like [**u/hdsrob**](https://www.reddit.com/user/hdsrob) said? 
I was just trying to help the guy at the level he's at. 
But he's specifically asking about using a fairly powerful gaming engine that's designed to use DirectX. 
I'll second (or third) the suggestion for monogame+VB.Net. I wrote an "electronic billboard" for our company using that combination and it runs off an Intel NUC at 60fps at 4K resolution. It's usually just showing 6 to 8 documents, but we did make a "moving maggots background" (for fun, not released in production) where we had ~10,000 small maggots moving on screen at 60fps and something around 30,000 at 30fps. That was without any particular effort at optimizing for speed and using a so-so video card (the Intel NUC built in one) and using monogame in OpenGL mode (since we had issues with DirectX during testing) The language doesn't really matter much, as the heavy lifting is done by monogame (which is mostly a thin layer over DirectX or OpenGL). The downside of using VB is that 99.9% of all examples for monogame and XNA are in C#, but they generally translate pretty easily. As for the difficulty, it shouldn't be too bad; just know that your game is basically and endless loop that reads input, updates game state, draws everything and repeats every 16 or 33 milliseconds. There are tons of XNA tutorials still available on the .net and most of them run with little to no modifications in monogame. 
Go to the [Developer Page](developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/ask-cli-intro.html) for Alexa and get the API command list for it. 
Most of the suggestions involve switching to C#. Consider Unity + C# I use VB.Net for work but my game dev projects are all using the Unity engine. That's my suggestion at least. (It supports both 3d &amp; 2d game dev and it's *free.)
So you have a form called 111\_userform. If it's a class within this template, you can just call it using Load 111_userform instead of creating a separate pointer to it. In terms of why the document won't display in webview, I would set the view only after the dialog box has been completed (so you could call the WebView() sub from one of the event handlers for the user form).
You are closing the form immediately after opening it. Why? Put a close in the form itself. Also, if you are operating solely within the Word VBA environment, your form name is not a legal object name - it must begin with an alpha. If you are operating solely in the Word VBA all you need is Private Sub Document_New() myform.show End Sub to display the form.
&gt; so you could call the WebView() sub from one of the event handlers for the user form I tried to do something similar to what you're suggesting by using a button1 click under the commandbutton_click sub but I could not get that to perform. What I know of VB was learned exclusively via word/excel (probably should have said so), please bear with me if I'm misinterpreting your solution.
I don't know if a Word Template vs a Word Document changes anything, but myform.show did not display the userform from when opening the template. Load myform does. That said, the form never closes. I want the form to close once the user clicks [OK] but VBA rejects myform.hide in the commandbutton_click() sub.
If you've put the code in the Document_New location, the only time the code will run is when a new document based on the template is created. Opening the template will not cause it to fire. If you want it to fire anytime a document based on the template is opened (including the template) use the Document_Open event. In the button to close, try Unload Me. You also might have issues with macro security. Check that?
Just skimming your code real quick, it looks like in your first “convert” function - which I’m guessing is to go from imperial to metric - you are assigning all the values to the imperial variable when you convert them, then outputting the metric variable for some reason. Since you aren’t assigning any of the conversions to the metric variable, obviously when you output the variable to the text box, it won’t show what you want. All that said, I don’t think that’s exactly what’s causing the problem you stated about the output always being 0 despite the input. It’s just something to think about. Once I get back to my computer I’ll try and look at this more thoroughly. 
Ahh ok gotcha, do you know how to fix it? I've only been learning for a few months and kinda over my head. 
Go back through the function that is supposed to convert from imperial to metric, and make sure that you are assigning the converted values to your metric variable. Write now, you’re assigning the converted values to the imperial value, which doesn’t make sense if you think about it. 
&gt; MetricUnits.Text = l_metric.ToString() Haven't I already done this? This basically assigns the converted value into the metric units area.
That would work, but if you look back through that function, you'll see that you never assign a value to the l_metric variable (except in one spot, when you convert from inches to centimeters.). in every other if block, you are assigning the converted value to your l_imperial variable. Since the value is stored in l_imperial, of course when you send the content of l_metric to the text box, it won't display what you want it to display. Before you fix anything, run a quick test and try to convert something from inches to centimeters. the code should work how you want it to, since this one spot is set up correctly. It doesn't look like any other conversions to metric will work because you are assigning the values to the wrong variable. To fix this, make sure you are assigning your converted values in the if blocks to the l_metric variable, not the l_imperial. I'll copy the specific code i'm referring to below... Private Sub S_converts() Dim l_metric As Decimal Dim l_imperial As Decimal i_imperial = Convert.ToDecimal(ImperialUnits.Text) If comboImperial.Text = "Inches" And comboMetric.Text = "Millimetres" Then l_imperial = l_metric / 25.4 ElseIf comboMetric.Text = "Inches" And comboImperial.Text = "Centimetres" Then l_metric = l_imperial * 2.54 'wip' ElseIf comboImperial.Text = "Inches" And comboMetric.Text = "Metres" Then l_imperial = l_metric / 0.0254 ElseIf comboImperial.Text = "Inches" And comboMetric.Text = "Kilometres" Then l_imperial = l_metric * 39370.1 ElseIf comboImperial.Text = "Feet" And comboMetric.Text = "Millimetres" Then l_imperial = l_metric / 304.8 ElseIf comboImperial.Text = "Feet" And comboMetric.Text = "Centimetres" Then l_imperial = l_metric / 30.48 ElseIf comboImperial.Text = "Feet" And comboMetric.Text = "Metres" Then l_imperial = l_metric / 0.3048 ElseIf comboImperial.Text = "Feet" And comboMetric.Text = "Kilometres" Then l_imperial = l_metric / 0.0003048 ElseIf comboImperial.Text = "Yards" And comboMetric.Text = "Millimetres" Then l_imperial = l_metric * 0.00109361 ElseIf comboImperial.Text = "Yards" And comboMetric.Text = "Centimetres" Then l_imperial = l_metric * 0.0109361 ElseIf comboImperial.Text = "Yards" And comboMetric.Text = "Metres" Then l_imperial = l_metric * 1.09361 ElseIf comboImperial.Text = "Yards" And comboMetric.Text = "Kilometres" Then l_imperial = l_metric * 1093.61 ElseIf comboImperial.Text = "Miles" And comboMetric.Text = "Millimetres" Then l_imperial = l_metric End If MetricUnits.Text = l_metric.ToString() End Sub
I've tested that before, it still outputs a zero. Yep, i haven't fully finished the code so i gotta do that later for the miles to millimetres. I haven't tried making all of them to l_metric to l_imperial though, so I'll do that now.
If it still isn’t working, then the only reason that pops to mind is that it isn’t entering any of those if-blocks. You’re getting the zero because that is the default value when you declare a decimal without initializing it. In all the if-blocks you are assigning a new value to the l_metric, so it should be getting the converted value. The only way it doesn’t change from the default 0 to the converted value is if it never enters any of those blocks, and thus doesn’t get assigned a new value, or if just by coincidence the converted value is 0 (but I highly doubt the second case, especially if you’ve been testing it) Are you using visual studio? Try to set a few break points during the function and see what the values are in real time when the code is being executed. If you don’t know, breakpoints are points that you tell the computer to stop running the program and let you see what is going on under the hood. I would google how to set/use breakpoints in visual studio. It’s a little complicated for me to try and explain accurately over reddit. They are really powerful when it comes to debugging, and worth getting familiar with. Also, double check and make sure you’re calling the right sub with the right situation. I’ve shut off my computer for the night so unfortunately I can’t copy/paste your code and run it myself, but if you still need help tomorrow, I’ll be able to help you out still. 
Yeah, that'd be good. I have no idea what is going on, would be good to see if you can get the program to work and show me what's going on.
Do you mean where to get Visual Basic.net? If so, there is a link in the side bar to the community edition. If you want to know were on your pc, just go with the default path that the installer uses.
I thought the link in the side bar was supposed to be Visual Studio?
Visual Studio comes with vb.net
Visual Studio is the program (also known as the IDE) you use to write VB.NET.
Visual Studio is the programming suite, it contains VB.Net, C#.Net just to name a few. You can opt to not install all the languages.
Hey! Sorry it took a while, I can't code at work. I was just able to get a copy of your code running on my computer. I copy-pasted the most recent code you updated, and when i ran the inches to centimeters test, it didn't work. Looking at the code more carefully, i saw that for the if block where we test if the imperial combobox' text is set to inches, you had accidentally typed to see if the metric combobox' text was set to "Inches". That's the only error in your logic. I fixed that, ran the inches to centimeters test again, and saw that it worked. 1 inch came to 2.54 centimeters. Running other tests to convert from arbitrary imperial units to arbitrary metric units worked, so far in that they provided numbers other than zero. however, you might want to check double check all the math. Converting from 1 yard came out to .00109361 millimeters, which isn't correct, of course. but converting from yards to meters looked like it worked. to be safe though, double check everything. In summary, the only thing i changed from the code you pasted above was that condition for checking if the imperial combobox' text is "Inches" when the metric combobox' text is set to "centimeters". Everything else produced a non-zero number without me having to change anything. I'll paste my code below so you can see what it looks like, but it is almost identical to yours. `Private Sub S_converts()` `Dim l_metric As Decimal` `Dim l_imperial As Decimal` `l_imperial = Convert.ToDecimal(ImperialUnits.Text)` `If comboImperial.Text = "Inches" And comboMetric.Text = "Millimetres" Then` `l_metric = l_imperial / 25.4` `ElseIf comboImperial.Text = "Inches" And comboMetric.Text = "Centimetres" Then` `l_metric = l_imperial * 2.54 'wip'` `ElseIf comboImperial.Text = "Inches" And comboMetric.Text = "Metres" Then` `l_metric = l_imperial / 0.0254` `ElseIf comboImperial.Text = "Inches" And comboMetric.Text = "Kilometres" Then` `l_metric = l_imperial * 39370.1` `ElseIf comboImperial.Text = "Feet" And comboMetric.Text = "Millimetres" Then` `l_metric = l_imperial / 304.8` `ElseIf comboImperial.Text = "Feet" And comboMetric.Text = "Centimetres" Then` `l_metric = l_imperial / 30.48` `ElseIf comboImperial.Text = "Feet" And comboMetric.Text = "Metres" Then` `l_metric = l_imperial / 0.3048` `ElseIf comboImperial.Text = "Feet" And comboMetric.Text = "Kilometres" Then` `l_metric = l_imperial / 0.0003048` `ElseIf comboImperial.Text = "Yards" And comboMetric.Text = "Millimetres" Then` `l_metric = l_imperial * 0.00109361` `ElseIf comboImperial.Text = "Yards" And comboMetric.Text = "Centimetres" Then` `l_metric = l_imperial * 0.0109361` `ElseIf comboImperial.Text = "Yards" And comboMetric.Text = "Metres" Then` `l_metric = l_imperial * 1.09361` `ElseIf comboImperial.Text = "Yards" And comboMetric.Text = "Kilometres" Then` `l_metric = l_imperial * 1093.61` `ElseIf comboImperial.Text = "Miles" And comboMetric.Text = "Millimetres" Then` `l_metric = l_imperial / 1609344` `ElseIf comboImperial.Text = "Miles" And comboMetric.Text = "Centimetres" Then` `l_metric = l_imperial / 160934.4` `ElseIf comboImperial.Text = "Miles" And comboMetric.Text = "Metres" Then` `l_metric = l_imperial * 0.00062137` `ElseIf comboImperial.Text = "Miles" And comboMetric.Text = "Kilometres" Then` `l_metric = l_imperial / 1.60934` `End If` `MetricUnits.Text = l_metric.ToString()` `End Sub` Hope this helps!
No worries mate, I got everything sorted. Thanks for everything! :D Really helped
This just a personal project?
School project really. 
If the school doesn't give you a specific db to store it in then you could just store it in a text file, access db, or even sql server express. You'll need to pick a data source first then figure out how to work with it.
Yeah I’m trying to store the data on csv/text file. Do I know to use “imports System.IO” for this ? 
If your missing any imports Visual Studio should let you know. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/how-to-write-text-to-files
Okay. I’ll try to do what’s prompted on the site 
Yes. Not sure how you’re supposed to do it but you could use a streamwriter to write/append the results to a CSV file when the ok button is pressed. 
Ohhh yes I get what you mean. I just got make sure that the data is stored correctly. Probably have it separated with a comma
Yep. Not too hard. &gt;StreamWriter.Write(FirstName &amp; “, “ ....rest of stuff) &gt;StreamWriter.Write(Environment.NewLine) 
Visual Basic has pretty good integration with ms access, you could give that a look
Probably the easiest way is to write your info to a datatable. It has a function to save the datatable as an xml (can't remember the exact name, but intellisense will find it with "xml". I think it's Write ml) Alternately, make a serializable class, and use an xml serializer. 
yo man do you have a discord
I should add that the group is about gaming, coding and talking so if you feel this is something you like, feel free to PM me
so the question is more how to persist the value across program runs? use the registry. how depends on what VB you're using 
Would I need administrator privileges to use use the registry?
What's wrong with the text file approach? Simple &amp; gets the job done. Another approach would be the Settings which offers a simple approach to saving state. [How to: Persist User Settings in Visual Basic](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/app-settings/how-to-persist-user-settings)
not for the "current user" tree.
in VB6 or VBA I might go for an INI file, in .net it's actually easier to use the registry functions.
I avoid messing w/ the registry unless absolutely necessary regardless of how easy it may be.
Sorry for such a late reply, but why not consider an Excel add-in? To make one, just make a new workbook, then choose Save As &gt; Excel Add-in (.xlam). Then, you can keep all your code inside the add-in, and it'll be available any time you open Excel. You can even modify the ribbon to add easy-to-access buttons. You can also share the add-in by simply sending the file to other people, and having them save it in the right location. 
XNA is obsolete, Monogame is the newest XNA. If I were you I would just use Unity as everything is there for you and it’s tried and tested.
This actually would probably work well (so long as I could save the add in on a mapped drive for everyone). I ended up getting what I was aiming for to work though, so all is well.
Glad to hear you got something to work for you! But yea, in case you wanted to try it in the future, you'd be able to save the add-in in a central location, and each user would just have to copy it onto their own machine and then load it into Excel. If you don't change it often, this could be easy to do. If you make frequent changes, however, it may be more troublesome.
Could I not load the module from a mapped drive or UNC path? I do sometimes make frequent updates. The idea was to allow me to "patch" future and already created versions of a particular spreadsheet. We make about a dozen copies of it a day under 6 users, so it'd be like rounding up cats to email them every time there was an update.
Cast to an integer first, then cast the final result back to a byte.
CByte(((Not (CInt(data(6)) + CInt(data(7)))) + 1) And 255) looks mildly horrific, but appears to work. I mourn for my code cleanliness.
Yea that was VBScript. If you want to play around with Visual Basic (.Net) then you can either install Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/ 
The worst part is that it's free!! FREE!!! I tells you.
If you don't want to go with a full IDE, you can start out with this: https://code.visualstudio.com/
Once you "up cast" the 1st byte to integer, VB will do the rest by itself, so you could make your code slightly less horrific by removing the 2nd Cint(): CByte(((Not (CInt(data(6)) + data(7))) + 1) And 255)

If you wrote it off company clock and there was not a contract written up, it is purely YOUR software. You were not asked to build it. This is the same as DICE using add ons made for Substance Painter, the artist who created the add on is the owner of said add on.
Post your code or properly outline your project.
You want to create an ApplicationEvents file.
what exactly have you tried that isn't working?
Use the changing of the checkbox as your trigger
The visibility of a textbox is a boolean value. The checked value of a checkbox is a boolean value. Look at setting the visibility property of the textbox to the checked value of its corresponding checkbox. I would do this in an event that monitors if the checkbox changes its checked value.
As I understand it you want to show or hide the textbox based upon the selected value of the checkbox above it. The first thing you need is an event to put code into. I would suggest either onchange or click of the corresponding checkbox. in that event you need to write code that modifies the visible status of textbox. so the way to make an object visiable or not is object.visible = (true or false) Figure out the event you want to use, then write code that makes the checkbox appear or disappear in that event. Post your code so we can help.
That I'm not too sure about. I think that when you load an add-in into Excel, it automatically copies it over to the Add-in folder, but there might be a way to map it to a shared drive that I'm not aware of. 
If you only want one of them to be selected at a time, use radio buttons instead. 
These are pretty interesting, though I'm not sure either is better. The first offends my sense of symmetry, and the second, arguably, adds an arithmetic operation (even though it's a 0) and I'm not sure how that effects performance or output code. As sad as all of that clutter makes me, I feel like it's also the most self-explanatory. Case-in-point, I don't need to add a comment to explain why I'm adding a zero.
Yeah, the comment is not strictly necessary, the compiler will inform anyone removing the zero of it's required presence, but it's still not immediately obvious why it's there unless you're familiar with VB's implicit casting rules. You could also make a C# class library and do the bit twiddling there... C# let's you overflow bytes without complaining (most of the time) unless you mark the code as "checked". Although that's in no way "simpler" :)
I've had a similar issue the visible code was not working for me. Luckily I had a picture at background and just send the pictures to the front of I wanted to show them For instance If chk1.checked Then Pic1.BringToFront() End if
aside from manually `.Move`ing (or .Top,.Left) them all, you can put them in a frame or picturebox and just .Move the picturebox
I'll have to look into that, how exact can you get with the position?
So I'm looking at the script and trying to figure out exactly what's wrong with the output on the 2008 machines vs the 2003 machines. Are the differences seemingly static in their deltas or are the appearing to be random?
The dates are all 1/1/1601 on server 2008 if that helps. 
You can get the current location with .location (.x, .y)
Huh? If the scalemode is pixel, then 1 pixel
Before you are clicking the button to make the math happen, are you inputting numbers in all the text boxes? Or are you only inputting numbers into the qi, qo textboxes? The reason I ask is because the first assignment you make is QOH = cint(qih.text), but then before the sun ends, you also write QOH = qi - qo, without ever using the initial value of QOH. That first assignment ( QOH = cint(qih.text)) is pointless; you don’t do anything with it. What I think is happening is the program is trying to convert that empty string in the qih text box to an integer, but it can’t, so it’s throwing that error. 
I am not inputting anything in qih.Text, I want the subtraction value to be displayed in it when I run it . You're right, thanks, I ended up doing it something like this. DIM QOH as Integer qih.Text = QOH
That does help. I'll look into this one later today once I'm done work and let you know what I can figure out. 
 Dim QOH As Integer = 0 Dim Qin As Integer = 0 Dim Qout As Integer = 0 if isNumeric(qih.text) and isNumeric(qi.text) then QOH = qih.text Qin = qi.text QOH = Qin - Qout else msgbox("Input values must be numbers") end if
Alright after further thought and some thorough googling I've determined the registry keys your using that work on 2003 systems are either not present in the 2008 systems or a they're present with null values. If you think about it there should be some scenarios where the date would be "12/31/1599" if the time zone correction was actually working but since you're seeing all values as "1/1/1600" I suspect all the registry values on 2008 systems to be null. That said I did find a few tips via google that stated there are working keys within 'Win32_Network' that would house the values you seek ([see here for details](https://serverfault.com/questions/85706/determining-logon-date-time-for-user-profiles-on-windows) ). Unfortunately I don't have a copy of 2008 sever to spin up in a VM myself but I believe coupling the info linked above and a simple system version check you should be able to craft either a new sub for your 2008 systems or simply set the registry key locations dynamically per OS version. Hopefully this helps. 
You could also use (abuse?) WinForm's databinding functionality: Public Class Form1 Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Me.Load CheckBox1.DataBindings.Add("Checked", Me.TextBox1, "Visible", True, DataSourceUpdateMode.OnPropertyChanged) TextBox1.DataBindings.Add("Visible", Me.CheckBox1, "Checked", True, DataSourceUpdateMode.OnPropertyChanged) End Sub End Class 
I don't know VBScripting at all. I understand what you are saying needs to be done, but unfortunately I don't know the language so I wouldn't be able to try and make anything other than basic modifications. Thanks for the info and the research I appreciate it. 
the short answer is: you declare variables in the scope that you need them. for a better answer, we need more info. in the Add click, you don't need 3 variables, really you don't need any variables at all. but that's just an efficiency/code clarity thing. it's really unclear what you want your calculate button to do.
Thank you, chrwei. The user is selecting items from listbox1 and adding them to listbox2. I am wanting the calculate button to add the values from listbox2 (intA and/or intB and/or intC) + another number (785). Whatever the new number is will be shown in a label. 
so then in your add click, you probably want to pull the selected value from listbox1, no need even for that if statement, which is duplicating variables. keep in mind the listbox itself internally has variables, and you can access those values via its methods. then on the calc, you need a for loop, or ideally a foreach, to add the values up into a local variable, then put that value into the label. I do zero vb.net, so i can't really be more specific. 
You could pull the values from the listbox and store them in a list of integers, or if you're only preforming simple math you could just iterate through the list box items and preform the math. It's inefficient to declare a bunch of variables when you don't know how much data you're going to use. Create as necessary and if you can avoid using one, it's better to do so. 
Thank you. I will give a try..
Thank you, Loz. I think I need to do the latter, performing simple math to iterate through the list box items and perform the math. I am struggling with how to hold the integer from list box two and then code it in the loop with the iteration to do the math.
You should be able to do something like: For Each item in Listbox1.Items Dim iNum as Integer Integer.TryParse(item, iNum) TextOutput.Text = iNum + whatever math Next
You can use listbox.items.add() to add your values. [See here for an example](http://vb.net-informations.com/gui/vb.net-listbox.htm)
Use Int.TryParse.
Here's what I did. I made a program that took the users email address and I hashed it into a 10 letter code. The install process would work and would allow the user to use the program for 30 days. The email address is entered into the software, and then they enter the serial code. If the email hashes properly then it generates the same serial code and the program will run. You could pull the date from an NNTP server to make sure you are getting the right time and date.
What happens if they forget their logins or have to reset?
they email you from their email address. You check and make sure that they bought the software, you regenerate the code. The beauty is, even if they give the code to someone else, unless they use the same email, that code won't work.
Ah, I see. That’s pretty smart actually.
Thanks! Now if you want to be really smart and use an authentication code then you could have a button in the software (if it's not authenticated) that says "request authorization code" or such that in the request submits the date or time or combination thereof. Then, you take that datecode and integrate it into your hash so that it generates a unique code. You send them that code back and the software authenticates. As I recall what I did is I had the users put a hashed file in their my documents folder, and the software looked for that, and if it found it it decoded it, and then deleted it. Or you could keep the serial file as a permanent serial number. 
In the code, Ctrl+H, select 'current project' and 'Find Whole Word Only'. Enter 'ISO' in the Find field, what you want to replace it with in the replace field, click go. For forms, it depends on how the labels are created. If they're generated from the code, the above will fix it, otherwise you'll need to open the forms and amend each label's name.
Thank you, that seems to have done the trick in large sections of the document. But there are what I think are "standard text" parts of the document, where there is a whole paragraph, for example a footnote or terms and condition that is added automatically to the generated template. These remain unchanged. Any thoughts.
If the code edit didn't fix those and if they're not in the base document itself then I'd suspect that they are being loaded from other documents. Are there other files associated with the document? Try searching the code for any instances of .open and finding what it's looking for.
It looks like they are in the autotext somehow, although the autotext codes don't seem to be in the code anywhere so I am not sure how the template populates everything. I also have no idea how to edit the autotext fields Thank you for all your help.
that might be because WMIv1 (System.Management) is deprecated and new code should use MMI/WMIv2 (Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure). I don't have much experience with either, so maybe MMI isn't any easier in reality. 
This could be useful to someone who is in and administrative role and managing multiple machines. Thanks for making it available to the community.
From my point of view it is quite similar. It doesn't solve that much complexity
I'm assuming you're using WinForms for this - so smooth animations are going to he an absolute nightmare. The rendering pipeline just wasn't designed for graphics work in WinForms. I'd strongly recommend switching to WPF (which you can still use Visual Basic for) and letting the animations be controlled by the powerful XAML controls available. If you really want to do it in WinForms your best bet would be to make the button yourself using a rectangle and use a timer event to increment the color alpha channel as you mouse into and out of it. Here's some steps (sorry I'm on mobile) - draw a rectangle and add events for onclick, mouse enter and mouse leave - set the background colour in code as a Color.FromARGB value - start a timer with a low interval whenever you mouse over the button - on each timer tick, increment the colour A value by whatever you want (note that you'll basically have to set a new colour since you can't raise the Alpha value alone) - when the desired alpha is reached, stop the timer. - repeat for the mouse leave event note that you'll also want to set the Form's `Double Buffered` property to True to avoid flickering It is definitely possible, and not too hard from a technical standpoint either, but the results aren't as crisp and fluid as they are with WPF. 
what happens between the close and edit again? any initialization code differences?
----- To Load Form --- Dim popup as new FormEditor Popup.showdialog popup.dispose ---------------- I was using on the Editor form: Dim AxEd As New Object AxEd = EditorNotes.ActiveXInstance AxEd .document.designmode = "On" I just changed it to: Editor.Document.ExecCommand("EditMode", False, Nothing) I only just did it, Have not fully tested it. It seems to have solved it, I can now edit on the second and third times I open the form. I honestly do not know why this would fix it. 
likely has to do with how you're preloading the document content. if you set document.designmode = "On", then replace document, it's not going to preserve the properties.
Setup Bootstrap is a basic exe that looks for some other files to actually run the install. it seems you are missing those files. are you trying to make an installer for your app, or just trying to install some app?
I am just trying to install it
ok, this sub is for programming in vb, for installing something someone else made you need to ask them since there's a 100 ways to deploy and we aren't going to know what they did.
Thanks for the reply! I figured this wasn't quite the right place for the question but thought I ask in case I am missing something really basic.
Thanks a lot. Will try learning WPF.
Just select it? What's next?
Select, Cut and paste to another folder to get zipped and archived. 
Hey. Noone would help you and do your homework if you come with this negativity. Google arrays and try to understand it. I hope you cam read English documents out there. If you can't understand this easy stuff, you are just lazy to read. Admit it. Arrays can be seen as lists. You can store them in variable. Ex: my-array(1)= {55, 66} The (2)means the number of elements we want. The numbers in the furly brackets at right hand side are the elements or actual data stored. Element have numberings to identify them called 'index number'. It starts from 0 to whatever is the last index number. So here, 55 is the my-array(0) element and 66 is my-array(1) element. In a table format, the array would be like this: [55] -&gt; 0th element [66] -&gt; 1st element Atleast visit YouTube and see videos. Work for that college certificate. People like you blame the college for not teaching, but you got every frecking resource to learn it out there. Just leave the course then. Take dedicated certifications if college buggs you.
Not sure what negativity your talking about. Ive been reading through the book, looking at the teachers examples and have spent probably 10 hours on arrays. Why would I leave college? I already have one degree and am a senior engineer for a county government. My day to do is server, storage, and BUDR, but I can see how you would think its lazy to not be good at everything. You sir are the one with the shit attitude. 
When you write that you can't stand programming, you don't deserve to get that knowledge. Even if you study it, I hope you never become a developer. Good that you've a different career option.
So youve never wanted to learn anything you didnt know? You must be 100% self taught.
Yes I am. Failed my school. Earn my own money since 13 or something. Made small websites &amp; softwares. One day didn't eat food 9 hrs to complete project. Earned it &amp; never studied what was pushed to me. Now doing cyber security..
Your assignment mentions "kept in an array or list" and I'd recommend you use lists instead of arrays. With arrays, you'll have to manage the size, removals, etc. while with lists you can use .add and .remove and the list will automatically manage itself for you. You can also manage the combobox simply by setting the list as the combo box's datasource...
I was able to create a club array and populate the combo box from that. I was also able to create my general student list array and populate that list from the array as well. The remaining pieces are to move a member to a club array and when a club is selected it shows the members list with all of the students in that club. 
I would access the excel spreadsheet using Oledb to run a query that returns your invoice numbers into a datatable. Then you can loop through the datatable with something like: For Each row As DataRow In dt.Rows IO.File.Move(IO.Path.Combine("D:\Temp1", row("InvoiceNum").ToString), IO.Path.Combine("D:\Temp2", row("InvoiceNum").ToString)) Next In this example, we've taken the result of the query that filled the datatable and looped through the rows. As we loop through, we pass the row("InvoiceNum") to a File.Move method that is set up to move the file from our Temp1 folder into our Temp2 folder. From there is should be nothing more than running a process of your flavor of command-line zip to take all the files in Temp2 and zip them up. 
Sounds like you're disposing something you're not supposed to dispose yet. Impossible to tell what the problem is without seeing the actual code and stack trace. &gt;You can use GDI+ to render graphical images on Windows Forms and controls. Although you cannot use GDI+ directly on **Web** Forms, you can display graphical images through the Image **Web Server** control. The second sentence has nothing to do with Windows Forms, you can absolutely draw directly on forms and controls.
Thank you for the response! :) &gt; Sounds like you're disposing something you're not supposed to dispose yet. So far as I know, I'm not manually disposing of anything. &gt;Impossible to tell what the problem is without seeing the actual code EDIT: Here are some more legible images: * [Declarations](https://i.imgur.com/AnnjiNx.png) * [Form load event](https://i.imgur.com/4lsDYaQ.png) * [Draw graphics subroutine](https://i.imgur.com/TrLOSZ0.png) Here's link to the [code](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t_7aMYaUKQV9I7m--4R-ETDUCH4qg5fi7GsAWWwit1I/edit?usp=sharing) on google docs and here's a [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/jPLWOjw.png) of the error. Here's the dropbox link old [sample project](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s0kurdcqcql835l/DragonDrop3.zip?dl=0) I found that uses basically the same method and generates the same error. Here's a [random website](https://www.dotnetheaven.com/article/gdi-double-buffering-and-flicker-free-drawing-in-vb.net) that shows the same "Dim g As Graphics = Form.CreateGraphics()" method. &gt;stack trace ...if you can tell me how to give you one. I don't see an option for it on the debuig menu, and if I'm reading [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/viewing-the-call-stack-in-visual-studio) correctly, it sounds like as of March, it's not implemented on the current version. &gt;The last part of the sentence has nothing to do with Windows Forms ...ahh, I seem to have misread that, yes. 
I usually paint by ovrriding OnPaintBackground. Here is a snippet from an application I wrote: Protected Overrides Sub OnPaintBackground(e As System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs) Dim g As Graphics = Graphics.FromImage(Me.mBackImage) g.Clear(Me.Parent.BackColor) ...Do some drawing and stuff e.Graphics.DrawImage(Me.mImage, 0, 0)
I know this may sound far fetched, but hear me out: have you considered perhaps doing your own homework?
Oh well yeah ive tried it. I can send you the code as well if you want. I just feel really stuck and I desperately need some help. Please.
Why don't you post the code your having problems with?
I tackled this a while back and where i started was researching the old Microsoft Registration Key. The way Microsoft "used" to register products was to generate a set of numbers 0000-0000-0000-0000-0000 the first set of numbers had to add up to a certain number (example: the first set would be 1421 = 8) so i wrote some code that would randomly generate a key-code (set of number) then I would verify that the first set added up to set number, and the second set would add up to another set number. It's not a "fool proof" method to generating a key, but it works. If you would like I could post the code.
Post part of the code you are having problems with and someone will help. You really need to understand the structure of the program and how it works
Post what you have.
You can also post your code and bugs in stackoverflow and people will show you your mistakes
In my experience vb doesn’t have quite such a good documentation for this sort of thing as C# does. I would go on the msdn site and read the documentation for how to do this in C#
Not exactly sure what you would "like" to do with the data once your get the document open. Try this: it will highlight any of the cells where the AGE is greater than 21... `Private Sub Button2_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button2.Click` `Dim cell As DataGridViewCell` `Dim cellVar As Integer` `For Each row As DataGridViewRow In Me.DataGridView1.Rows` `cell = row.Cells(4)` `cellVar = CInt(row.Cells(4).Value)` `If cellVar &gt;= 21 Then` `cell.Style.BackColor = Color.Red` `End If Next End Sub`
Thank you so much! I see now what I had to do to make it recognize specific data within the cells. Thanks so much dude, you're helping me learn for my new job!
Another way of doing what mreed1972 demonstrated is with the RowFilter of the DefautView of the DataTable. For example you have a datatable which is the datasource of your DGV so to do something similar to this to only show people that are at least 21 would be ExcelData.DefaultView.RowFilter = "Age &gt;= 21" This will then only show rows that meet that critera. The nice thing about this is that you haven't lost anything by simply setting the rowfilter to "" will bring back all underlying data unfiltered.
I gave you code to do 99% of this last week. https://www.reddit.com/r/vba/comments/917mtx/need_help_figuring_out_how_to_grab_info_from_a/
It does not work. I've tried messing with it for 3-4 days. I told you I couldn't create folders, just needed files. I tried breaking it down and restructuring, still didn't work. The function your provided to also doesn't work and I tried to debug.
If you can't get MkDir() to work, you have issues with your administrative rights. But, maybe someone else will come to your aid. Good luck, regardless.
What do you have so far?
Yeah, I understand what you are saying and I believe that may be part of the problem as well. I never needed folders to be created though, I simply am trying to create files in the same locations.
A lot of bits and pieces from /u/slang4201 He provided me with a lot of useful info, but it was mixed in with a few things that I can't utilize for this task and I've been having a hard time removing them and changing them. I'm not sure what to relabel things, etc. Other bits I have are just basic and simplistic. For Each itable In ActiveDocument.tables itable.Cell(2, 1).Range.Select Selection.Copy and recorded macros for saving as new documents and stuff. If you want me to paste that as well I can. I understand loops/next, etc. I also understand that I can dim startRange and endRange to be my ranges and stuff but I don't know how to define them as above pagebreak and below page break. I can use /u/slang4201 's code he provided to help with copying within range and saving in the document, but when I tried it form his, I was still getting debugging errors on the function.
Also, please don't think I am being ungrateful. I seriously am very appreciative for your help, but for someone that has never even looked at VB before, debugging for me and slowly learning it is an extreme task and I wanted to try to get others input as well. You code you provided has helped me learn many things, but some things I am clueless on.
What errors are you getting?
What kind of coding do you need done? My company I work at still codes some legacy apps in VB6, so I might be familiar enough to help you out
It’s a really simple project I’ll keep it real with you. I’m in a coding class for school I hate it can’t be bothered and I’m 100% not going to be doing this as a career but I need to do well in this class. So my program that I am making a is a tool for school kids, it allows them to select their 5 subjects from a drop down list which then automatically adds it to another form where they can record their homework and then the homework can be ticked off once completed and added to an archive. There is also a timetable where it takes the subjects from the subject form and inserts it into the timetable there is only X number of combinations so they can click a button to cycle through all the combinations until it matches their timetable. And that is pretty much it. I can send you the design plan and stuff but I need this by Friday so I know, sorry for the short notice!
You are an absolute legend! I can send you what I’ve done so far, just dm me your email or something I’ll zip it up!
I would be willing to give it the old college try. Feel free to DM me whenever.
I know u/FriendlyKush already offered, do you mind if I also have a go (for free of course)? I need to procrastinate :P 
You all are too kind! :)
Unfortunately not - you need to migrate to UWP if you want to use .Net native If it's just the external dependencies that are the issue, target the lowest common version of .NET framework for the OS you're using, and then use something like Fody to embed the rest of the dependencies into the program's main binary. You can't escape the.Net framework downloads without UWP unfortunately 
Hey sry, im not really sure on how to read the errors. It just wont run the function.
PMd
is there anything specific you are looking to do to help us steer this advice? importing / exporting / saving and attaching to an email / or just cell manipulation? Personally, I taught myself excel vba by looking at existing code and adapting it to my needs mostly. (I did have a logic/programming course that covered general topics in programming, but that was with C#). One of my first projects that really got me into vba was [MyLongWar](https://www.nexusmods.com/xcom/mods/567/), a spreadsheet meant to help people more easily customize the mods in the Xcom War Within (Long War Mod). the VB code is accessible if you were to download and attempt to view it. that spreadsheet imports various tab-delimited text files, fills up the spreadsheet, and has a ton of functionality for modifying the config files of that game (which are just tab delimited text files). It also has userforms, so you can see how we called those up and what we did there to manipulate the spreadsheet. 
Trust me on this, go to YouTube and search for wise owl vba, they have a course of 70 videos that takes you from nowhere to an expert....and free... It's the best tutorial out there by far even compared to paid ones...
I am gonna be more inclined to do office works. Like making complicated payroll system(lots of deductions and bonuses and classifications of where the labor is applied to ) and other office works that has a little bit of complicated computations that needs a standard report output. I hope my description helps. I might become interested in making other applications and try other programming language if my skills will permit to do so in the future.
I'll consider this and view them now. Thanks. There are a lot of video tutorial on YouTube but I don't know where to start. Thanks for the advice.
Currently going through these videos now. They are very good. Thanks for the heads up!
Not to discourage you, but If it’s for a mid-large company and your goal is a excel time sheet or payroll for people to fill out, there are already applications available for use for what you want to do. That said, the VP of my company wrote our original excel time sheet (which worked, but was rudimentary and lacking ease of use. It’s primarily used for traveling personnel who don’t have daily access to be able to clock in. ). Once I got my hands on it, I really improved it quite a bit in regards to user functionality and a bit easier readout for the people that enter data into the payroll / work order systems. My recommendation if you are going to pursue it is to have a page (or several) dedicated to the report layout, and have the code fill in data dynamically on that report (that way if additional rows for a section are needed it can done automatically in the code to only start the next section once that first section is complete.) Have all the data points on other pages and just parse the pages as needed. You will likely need to hard code some exceptions in if you are performing math based on time within the cells (because midnight of current day is 00:00 and midnight of next day is 1/1/1900 00:00) Also, use ‘Application.ScreenUpdating = True/False’ it, it will really help with processing time by not requiring every edit to be displayed prior to working on the next cell change. 
I learned to manipulate vba by recording and editing macros to figure out how the library worked. VB6 stuff should mostly work in vba as well. Also check out r/excel
I think you want `=` not `Is`. also set a breakpoint and make sure it's getting the value you expect
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/custom-numeric-format-strings Look into the "0" custom specifier to format leading 0s on numeric formats. 
You should be able to obtain that information using the following code: My.Computer.Info.OSFullName [Microsoft Article Link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualbasic.devices.computerinfo.osfullname?view=netframework-4.7.2#Microsoft_VisualBasic_Devices_ComputerInfo_OSFullName) Eliminates the need to reference the registry all together. Then you can do If My.Computer.Info.OSFullName.Contains("Windows 10") Then Do Stuff Else Do Other Stuff End If
Thanks for your recommendations. That helped me a lot to think about what is and should be my goal to pursue in vba and programming. I will still pursue my goal into introducing myself with programming. Not only in vba but also other language. Again, thanks.
I also found that out after searching stuffs. I have to type vba to get my desired results
 dim table = new OddsTable(of String)(); For x = 0 to names.Count - 1 table.Add ( names(x), names.Count - x) next Dim d = new Dice dim name = d.ChooseWithOdds (table) Odds Table: https://github.com/Grauenwolf/TravellerTools/blob/master/TravellerTools/Grauenwolf.TravellerTools.Shared/OddsTable%601.cs Odds Row: https://github.com/Grauenwolf/TravellerTools/blob/master/TravellerTools/Grauenwolf.TravellerTools.Shared/OddsRow%601.cs Use: See ChooseWithOdds in https://github.com/Grauenwolf/TravellerTools/blob/master/TravellerTools/Grauenwolf.TravellerTools.Shared/Dice.cs (Sorry its in C#. Let me know if you need help translating into VB.)
It's late but I believe the function is [x^(2)](https://www.google.com/search?q=x%5E2). What I'd try is to feed it a number between 0 and less than 1 (the result of Rnd() works nicely), multiply that by your max value 1218, and round it to an integer. Since the line near 0 is flatter, the numbers that round to 0, 1, 2, etc. is somewhat normal and should appear more often. Since the line near 1 is less flat, the range of numbers numbers that round to 1215, 1216, 1217, etc. is smaller thus should appear less often.
Roll 3 times and take the average. You should be able to get a bell-curved distribution that way. The more times you roll, the more likely you're going to get a number from the middle.
But I want the peak of the bell to be at zero, and go down from there. Do I just add zeros into that average?
Just subtract half the max number from the result. This shifts your curve to the left so that it peaks at 0.
If you want help I’d advise attempting the code as best you can then posting it here with more specific questions so we can use the code as a reference.
So not knowing what all your values are, it's tough to help, but I think something like this should work. As long as firstminutes and first seconds are always ints and the correct 0-60. The bonus benefit is this would format all your times, not just the 00 00. Of course you may want to put this in a function, as I assume you'll use it a lot. Dim firstMin As String = "0" Dim firstSeconds As String = "0" Dim now = DateTime.Now Dim clockTime As New DateTime(now.Year, now.Month, now.Day, now.Hour, CInt(firstMin), CInt(firstSeconds)) someThing.Text = clockTime.ToString("mm:ss") 
Before I read your solution my first thought was find where the profile is stored and check the date modified. As long as you're sure the temp folder will ALWAYS get modified when someone logs in, yea this seems like the right way to go. I'm not an expert on that topic so I would defer to someone who knows more about AD and users. 
You are declaring a local variable with the same name in the button click handler and setting it to 1 every time you click the button. The local variable hide the class level variable within the scope of the button handler.
I switched to Select Case and it works perfectly. Thanks so much! 
pretty straight forward, something along the lines of sub keywordtextbox_change matchingtextbox.visible = keywordtextbox.text = "keyword" 
what's the value of opt code?
Drop Webbrowser control and get something like DotnetBrowser.
I did this with an application that backups up every 45 days. What I did was write a value to the registry ([Date.now](https://Date.now)) and each time the application is ran, it checks today's date against that registry date, and if the datediff is &gt; 45, it runs the backup then resets the registry date.
You can get free trial / 30 days.
Yep. It's odd.
Figured out the issue. Needed a space after -code"
Yea I figured it was something small like that

What I have had the most success with is doing this, Dim checkload = System.AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory() + "\filename.dat" Then IO.File.ReadAllLines(checkload) Which I can input into text boxes, dropdowns, etc by doing something like combobox1.Items.AddRange(IO.File.ReadAllLines(checkload)) So I can confirm that I have access to the lines in the dat file (which is really just a simple text file). The main problem is I am not sure how to load my information into a private sub that I can load on program startup. I have googled till I'm blue but I can't seem to find the right word combo to pull up how to do it, or even something to point me in the right direction to research how to do it. Probably this isn't even best practices, I haven't ever imagined wanting to allow users to modify the tooltips, but in this instance I wanted the option. 
how do the lines relate to the tool tips? you need to parse the file, loop each line, or something like that. it would be better to use something made for this, like https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/a65txexh.aspx
AddRange parses the lines, which it can do since they are all going in the same list. to put them in different tooltips, you need to parse the lines yourself. if you're looking for a magic one-liner, there isn't one. 
Yeah, addrange reads it and helps put them into the cmbbx. But since I've got them in the variable I was just hoping to have them go from them to being loaded and working. I did not think it would be a one liner, just couldn't find it on google so thought I would ask if there is a way to go from Dim checkload = System.AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory() + "\filename.dat" to a full fledged private sub. Thanks for the help!
Private sub Button1_Click(...) *CurrentForm*.Hide() *FormYouWantToChangeTo*.Show() End Sub
You might be better off using a dictionary of string and int. The string (key) would be the letter and the int would be the count
I'd probably just use a dictionary(of string, integer) and update the value as you pass through.
you'd need to ask them, but it certainly looks vb6-ish
looks at its dependencies. Does it need VBRUN? Are all the strings within needlessly unicode?
Why would they say it is if it is not? It's not a good idea, and there could be legal issues, to falsify issues about your product.
ah, so this is some kind of plugin? you need the contact their support, the issue is with the plugin.
What no I'm developing for Windows Phone 8.1
I assume you've done memory and hdd diagnostics? verified the xaml files aren't corrupt? you're probably stuck with whatever MS support options are. you have a VS software issue or a PC hardware issue, not a VB one.
No how do i do that?!?
uh, diagnose your hardware? not really on topic here
I'm confused by your statement friend? I'm not getting clear directions from what your giving me.
memtest has its own support group if you can't follow its instructions. diagnosing hardware issues is not on topic here
If that is the case why would you suggest these things if you aren't willing to go in further to help me. That's counter productive to helping solve the issue.
because suggesting you in some possible direction is more helpful than shrugging you off. it's also a good idea to read docs and decide for yourself if a suggestion is good for you, blinding following random stranger advise is a good way to get hacked. read memtest docs and it's pretty clear how to use it. 
&gt;blinding following random stranger advise is a good way to get hacked Buddy if your wanting to help someone you don't go sending them into a random goose hunt for them to ultimately not find a solution to their problem. If you weren't willing to give any more effort into helping you could have I'd rather them looked else as I'm doing now. If your naive enough to do and listen to any ones suggestion without questioning their narrative that's fine by me, but don't go thinking everyone else will. Just reading "docs" is my example to how the info your giving me isn't helpful at all. If you wanted to point to a specific source then I would appreciate that but your not even doing that. Fort the future if it's to much of an hassle for you to be willing to throw your self into helping someone it would be beneficial for you and as well as the questionnairey not to even have given a solution.
&gt;you type "how to use memtest86+" into google and get all the guides you can handle Again this isn't useful and I've already done before your second comment as didn't know where to stay or which would be beneficial to a resolution. &gt;why do i need to hold your hand here when it's completely off topic? No one is asking for their hand to be held, and if it's off topic why would you suggest out in the FIRST place. &gt;make an effort and ask specific follow up questions. That's what i have done I have given effort to ask what is needed if you felt like that it wasn't sufficient you could have not even bothered to reply. I don't think you've been able to help someone before but if you are going to you should try to understand where there scope of knowledge is on things you suggest them, then think "if what they are saying seems broad to me then maybe I should try to be able to explain it more and help them understand. If I can't PR don't want to I should just give up and not persist any further".
you have not asked a single specific question about memtest. 
and the code in question?
Just about to update the post, figured it out. I started the program on a laptop at work without importing the image resource i used, so i just had to remove the reference to the namespace it couldnt find from: Global.'NameSpace'.My.Resource... etc to My.Resource...
So unclear it's difficult to help. What is your intended result here? You either need both data items in your list or you don't. If you need to group by one data item (for an export or GUI) then just clone it or pass it to a view model.
First click on stop button and try again if it doesn't work then reply
Might be an infinite loop, depending on what Less() does. It looks like you are assigning ‘l‘ a value in the loop, making it always less than the max for the exit condition.
it doesn't work
oh, thanks about telling me about the immediate window, here is a pic of the errors window: https://puu.sh/Bg7B3/cb80758d35.png Also, for better understanding of what checking if state is solvable, I made an example and the function to check it: https://puu.sh/Bg8li/afebfb3a1e.png And here what I did in Solvable(): https://puu.sh/Bg8mu/cbcd89b3e1.png

What is Less() returning exactly? I'm pretty sure you have a infinite loop. Did you try adding a break point and stepping through the code?
Dim Less(16) As Integer
Ah crap I'm an idiot I'm sorry! I forgot VB syntax for arrays use parenthesis, I thought Less was a function. Do you know how to step through your code? Google visual studio debugging, or how to use breakpoints. I'm on mobile and about to sleep, else I would walk you through how. It'll allow you to see exactly what the code is doing, and you should be able to see what's going wrong.
Ok, thanks for everything, I'm about to go to sleep soon too, I'll do that tomorrow morning, thanks for helping. I'll reply you asap.
I didnt try that debugging with breakpoints, (I'll learn to use them soon), but I fixed the problem, I changed this: https://puu.sh/Bg3kM/000680a0fd.png into this: https://puu.sh/Bglaz/b6dfd8a7fe.png and now I F5 and it opens and run the program no problem, and so now I can see if the initial state is solvable or not, yey, also, ye, I'm pretty sure I had some infinite loop or sth in the one causing the error.. because also when I run it, I looked up in the task manager and while it was not opened but running it was consuming 30+% of my cpu, well, now its all fixed, thanks for everything
can you provide some sample data and what you're looking to do. As mentioned by /u/Wol377 it's not very clear what you're trying to do. 
I would start by trying to get a script running that just creates a folder. I.e. get something where you can see it creates the folder "test" in your inbox. From there, then try to get something working that checks if the folder test exists, and if it doesn't, create it. After that, work on researching a script that can read your emails, specifically the subject. Once you have that, work on something that can parse your subject to pull out the id. Once you have that, you can pull it into the previous one that was creating the test folder, but interchange test with the id. That might sound like a lot of work because, well, a script like this will be. Maybe there's someone out there with more knowledge on outlook specific VB, but no one on here is going to write it for you, unless they've already written something. I was just trying to give you pointers on how to go about building it, since you mentioned you're new. 
Office Apps (including Outlook) use a subset of VB called VBA (Visual Basic for Applications). You might get more or better help in /r/vba 
Do you know of any good resources for this? 
I'll do that thank you!
Not off hand. I would Google outlook vb script create folder or variations of that and see what comes up.
If you're running into problems though let me know, I'll see if I can help
Recording macros is a great way to get functional quickly if you have any familiarity with coding. Even if it was just formulas on a graphing calculator and stuff back in high school. You can get crazy advanced in VBA but for, if, and while will accomplish a lot of the non-Excel Object parts of VBA. Outside of that, it's learning the Excel object and macros and msdn are great starters. 
So I was able to get this running. So I have a rule already set so when the emailer that sends the case notification email goes into a folder named "Cases". I got this part of the script up and going where it simply creates a new folder based on the subject line. Is there a way to iterate over the current folders to see if one exists if not add and if it does place the email inside? Is it possible to only use part of a subject line? Dim WithEvents Processor As Items Private Sub Application\_Startup() Dim ns As Outlook.NameSpace Set ns = GetNamespace("MAPI") 'Change NAME\_OF\_MAILBOX to the name of your account (should be visible in outlook titlebar). Set Processor = ns.Folders.Item("NAME\_OF\_MAILBOX").Folders.Item("Cases").Items End Sub Sub Processor\_ItemAdd(ByVal MailItem As Object) Dim ns As Outlook.NameSpace Dim ProcessedFolders As Folders Dim SearchedFolder As Outlook.Folder Set ns = GetNamespace("MAPI") 'Change NAME\_OF\_MAILBOX to the name of your account (should be visible in outlook titlebar). Set ProcessedFolders = ns.Folders.Item(" NAME\_OF\_MAILBOX").Folders.Item("My Cases").Folders On Error Resume Next Set SearchedFolder = ProcessedFolders(MailItem.Subject) On Error GoTo 0 If Not SearchedFolder Is Nothing Then 'move item MailItem.Move SearchedFolder Else 'make folder then move item ProcessedFolders.Add (MailItem.Subject) Set SearchedFolder = ProcessedFolders(MailItem.Subject) MailItem.Move SearchedFolder End If Set ns = Nothing Set ProcessedFolders = Nothing Set SearchedFolder = Nothing End Sub
Oh, by the way, is there any way to make a font download to someone's computer on launch, because if I use a chess font on someone else's computer it will appear as P, p, R, r, etc., Not actual chess pieces
I don't know about office api or anything related to office tools.. but I know that using vb/c#, we can embed ppt presentations on a form using custom control. The custom control(maybe user control) can have ppt as base and webview on top. Really sorry if I'm wrong here, but 1 solution I can find is to make a ppt reader with embed webview.. like such: form.vb _______________________________ | Slide | [ slide template | | Controls | | and webview | | Here | [ on top of template | |_________________ ____________ | (diagram made on mobile, may not look good, but if you get what I mean..) Controls on one side(new slide, delete slide etc), a container with slide template on other. Inside the template container, u put a webview(webbrowser) control. I don't even know if I'm right, just throwing out ideas..
Hi all - I was wondering if anybody could give me some advice. I am currently doing a project based on a fictious Pizza store. I am having a bit of trouble getting my head around it. I'm given a table of Pizza Name Pizza Type and Pizza Price that I have to put into HTML. I an familiar with the concepts of basic CSS but I'm having a lot of trouble using Microsoft Visual Studio 2012017 ASP.Net core. I'm not sure how or where to declare the different variables and integer - am I supposed to do this all in the PizzaController and and then use Razor blocks in HTML to call the declared? I know that would need to be done in a View file which I would have to create but how would I be able to render that table in Visual Studio 2017 using C# Razor in HTML. I can post where I'm up to or what attempts I've made. However its riddled with errors and I'd like to know if somebody could give me a hand in this. I have seen this is a breeze for some but I'm not used to Visual Studio- so any advice is welcome. thanks in advance :)
Read up on Outlook Interop. Anything you want to do with Outlook, you can probably achieve You can enumerate folders to find all available folders [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff184607.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff184607.aspx) You can also add a folder: [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff184655.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff184655.aspx) You can move items into folders: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/vsto/how-to-programmatically-move-items-in-outlook](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/vsto/how-to-programmatically-move-items-in-outlook)
What does the input worksheet look like, and what does the output look like? In a case such as this, you will probably learn far more from already existing code than trying to start on such a project from scratch.
You could create a web service and then call it with java script. 
Sorry I'm not much familiar with javascript yet
the website is [www.delugerpg.com](https://www.delugerpg.com) &amp;#x200B; When I'll use invokemember("click"), after a while my account will be logout then says banned for cheating. I just wanted to make an automation for auto start battle because its kinda hassle to manually click the button, and also if I use SendKeys.Send("{ENTER}") , I can't multiple task (needs to only run this project1.exe)
This is the HTML Code: &lt;input class="btn btn-primary" type="submit" name="attack" value=" Attack " style="margin-top:20px"&gt;
What you'd want to research then is making an ajax request with javascript, and creating a web service. I'm assuming web forms if you're using vb, if not then let me know what you're working in. But basically JS runs client side in the browser, but you make a "call" to the server, the server runs some server side code, and then returns the data (usually in json form) to the JS that made the call, and then the JS does whatever you want to it to display it. 
I'm sorry that I really have no idea what you are talking about as I haven't ventured onto that yet, but anyways you might wanna give an example for my problem so I'll have an idea on what to do next. I've been stuck on this for quite a while now, also be needing this for my future references
How bout a sample code for a triggering event, wanted to know what it looks like as a code. A simple one will do if you don't mind
I would imagine it is probably something in your code that is sending clicks to frequently or something along those lines as to why it would log you out and ban you for cheating. Just the use of invokemember itself would not be enough for the page to know this was being automated.
Text in what? Like are you trying to find the error message? I'd google around to see if TF2 logs that stuff in a text file somewhere, my guess is it does. 
So does it absolutely have to be a tray icon? I know if it were me I might overlook that when things go "bad", which is what I'm assuming this is for. If that's the case I'd build something that either sends an email or text.
No, this isn't for when things go bad. This is to check if there's a process in progress. If there is, the field will a "A" (for "Active"). When it's done, the field changes to "C" (for "Complete"). So the green light means there's no process in progress, and the red light means there is one.
If you google "vb.net systray application" you will find lots of good tutorials and sample code. It's actually pretty easy. Then you could use a Timer to periodically poll the Access DB and just change the icon as needed. In other words, rather than change the colour, you just have two icons: a red one and a green one and you pick the one that applies.
if you're wanting to stick with that ol vb6, I've used [this systray](https://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=12016&amp;lngWId=1) object to add a tray icon to old apps, it's pretty easy. for vb.net, you just use the NotifyIcon control, again pretty easy.
get visual studio community. 
I haven't done systray apps but I don't think you can change the colour of the icon. You have to instead change the icon itself. That's why I was suggesting using multiple icons instead of trying to change the colour. Visual Studio has a bunch of free developer tools. They are full-featured, not stripped down. Most professional developers use the free tools unless they are in a company that's big enough that they don't comply with the license rules. https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/ For this you probably want Visual Studio Community. Visual Studio is a bit overwhelming at first but just follow the tutorials you find online and you just use the 2% of the overall functionality that you need.
Thanks!
&gt; I haven't done systray apps but I don't think you can change the colour of the icon. You have to instead change the icon itself. That's why I was suggesting using multiple icons instead of trying to change the colour. I see. I was thinking that the program could change the color of the circle WITHIN the icon on the fly. But if that's not possible, then, yeah, having two icons would be best. Thanks. &gt; [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/) &gt; &gt;For this you probably want Visual Studio Community. Visual Studio is a bit overwhelming at first but just follow the tutorials you find online and you just use the 2% of the overall functionality that you need. Thanks! Bookmarked it.
It does. I looked a ton into this. But unfortunately that isn't a option for me, due to the way my program works. I have a script running in tf2 that echos "executed-etc" when it is run. I need to know exactly when it runs. My only option(I think) is win32 api used to read the middle. So that is what I am looking to do.
Basically I am trying to make up a program that allows for data (Basketball player names, points,and fouls scored in a single game) to be entered into a list box which is then used to calculate some basic statistics. One of the requirements I have to do is using regrex to validate the text boxes used for data entry but it just isn’t working for some reason 
I haven’t entered it yet because I am not sure where and how to use it...
I haven’t entered it yet because I am not sure where and how to use it...
Pretty easy to do. Instead of using the ‘ActiveCell.offset’ function, use a for loop. &gt;Dim r as integer: R = 0 With ActiveSheet For r = 1 to [max rows in sheet] If .cells(r,1) = “” then .cells(r,1)= TextBox1.Value .cells(r,2)= TextBox2.Value .cells(r,3)= TextBox3.Value .cells(r,4)= TextBox4.Value Call resetForm Exit sub Else ‘Do Nothing. End if Next r End with I cant remember the easy Way to find the last row, so i just usually use an absurdly high number 
Thank you so much I’ll try this out! 
VBA is definitely the place to start, though if you want to learn programming in general I wouldn't necessarily recommend it long term, but if you just want to get something done then it's great. I'm happy to help you get started, what were the problems you were running into exactly? FYI, if you also wanted to look at other options: If you want to use python you can take a look at xlwings: https://www.xlwings.org/ I have not used it but I've heard really good things. If you wanted to learn programming in general and want to start with Excel automation, both VB.net and C# can easily interact with Excel. Downside is the interaction wouldn't be embedded, and it's not as easy as VBA (but close). Also, VB.net and VBA are similar, so if you know VBA you can pretty easily pick up VB.net (though there are a few very key differences). If you want to learn how to do this, I have an example program for interacting with Excel I'm happy to send - using Excel interop, you get the active Excel app, and from there it is similar to VBA. Lastly, if you are more familiar with SQL there is [QueryStorm](https://www.querystorm.com/) which might be able to help. Mostly I just think it's cool though.
For this specific task, I thought VBA would be good too. Essentially, I just need to do a lot of find &amp; replaces. The way I have been doing is that everytime I feed raw data into my excel sheet, there are 30 department names that I want to replace into 5 names which I have thus far been doing find and replace for 30 times. There is another find and replace I want to do where I replace a highlighted cell and replace that with text. I have been doing this manually but since I keep updating the data periodically, it would be helpful to find &amp; replace automatically upon entering data. &amp;#x200B; Also if there are any other automation tips I could use with Excel, would be helpful to know. 
assuming DocumentSplitter has a method to extract a page range, do something like: filename="" startpage=0 loop over pages if this page has a barcode if filename &lt;&gt; "" extract page range from startpage to current page-1 end if set filename set startpage=this page end if end loop if filename &lt;&gt; "" extract page range from startpage to last page 
Would i include that after the: For i As Integer = 0 To pageCount - 1 &amp;#x200B; ? 
it's pseudo code, you don't "include it". you replace all your loops with this logic. you only need loop to do this.
Ok, so im a bit confused, and i tried replacing my loops with what you wrote, so something like this? &amp;#x200B; Dim pageCount As Integer = extractor.GetPageCount() inputFile = "" pageCount = 0 For i As Integer = 0 To pageCount - 1 If extractor.Find(i, "COVERSPLIT", False) Then If inputFile &lt;&gt; "" Then Using splitter As New DocumentSplitter() splitter.OptimizeSplittedDocuments = True End If &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
that's a start. the key here is how to save multiple pages out, you should check DocumentSplitter's docs first
I’ve already created the table in Access to link the data in my he forms. I just don’t know how to bring the forms to Access
You don't. Access forms and VB.NET forms are 2 different things. You either create the forms in access and link those to your tables, or you make the forms in vb.net and connect to the access tables as a datasource.
How are you given the Pizza Name Pizza Type and Pizza Price values?
Perhaps you could attach a new line character to the start of the text before inputting it into the text box.
Thanks! Not exactly what i was looking for but i went off of it and got it solved :)
Just one problem with this....... say for instance, i have: Hello, test \&gt;&gt;MY TEXT HERE Hello, Test 2 how would i do this?
Substring the number to remove from back or front and then concatenate. Search vb.net substring() online.
That doesn't work. If i make a text box and i do Textbox1.Text = [my function] it fills the text box with the value so i know it's getting it. 
You need "=" not "Is" "Is" compares two object references to see if they point to the same object. "=" compares the values of two variables to see if they are the same. 
[removed]
3 things. 1. Instead of saying, "I figured it out." Post your solution. Repetition is good for learning so writing it out once more won't hurt. You also help others who come after you with the same problem. 2. Integer.TryParse is your friend. If the network device is returning numbers, treat them as numbers. You will save time later when hunting for bugs. 3. In your post above the string literal "1" is called a magic string. Consider replacing it with a string constant variable that describes its meaning (ex. Private Const DEVICE_LED_IS_GREEN As String = "1"). This will make your code more robust, and clearer to understand when you or someone else has to maintain it in the future.
Thanks :)
Yeah, well. The VB document consists of rougly 15.000 lines of code. Now I'm not lazy, but that's ALOT. And can't find any line consisting: Set dbs = OpenDatabase(AppPath &amp; dbA15) Set rcs = dbs.OpenRecordset("SPIN", dbOpenDynaset) 
Hey, Rocket-Reatre, just a quick heads-up: **alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**. Have a nice day! ^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.

what publish method are you using? are you sending the release version or the debug version? debug is more likely to get false positives. the most foolproof is to make a clickonce installer and zip it up and have them download that. 
Zip it up, change extension to .snd, send, done
You shouldn't be sending your elderly mother source code anyways, unless she's programming on it with you. As others have mentioned you should publish an install-able executable. That's relatively straight forward, at lest getting the executable created. Maintaining an installer across different versions of windows can be, um, interesting.
That's now how LIKE works. Its expecting a pattern. Use CONTAINS. Eg: `If filename.Contains(name) Then 'Do something End`
Just tried this, too, and it brings up a blank cmd prompt and nothing happens. 
Here you go https://m.imgur.com/a/YxDwlcf
Based on your last sentence, it sounds as though you aren't actually running the application, you're just looking at the designer file for it. I'm assuming you're using Visual Studio, so just press F5 (or click on the green &gt; at the top where it says 'Debug') and it should start the application.
This looks great, but pardon my ignorance... since this is all condensened into a singular sub... how do i call this without a Sub main() ? Every time i run it it gives me back a Sub Main was not found in module
You are confusing your variables with your text box and label names also, your variables have not been initialised with any value so how are they mean to process anything? You need to say this, I want to capture whatever is in the text properties of the text box to a new variable that I just created and named(name can be anything you want, it should be meaningful though) for example, you need : Dim num1 as integer = TxtInput1.text Dim num2 as integer = TxtInput2.text Dim result as integer = num1 / num2 LblResult.text = result

It's on sale at the moment. [https://www.udemy.com/learning-visual-basic-net/](https://www.udemy.com/learning-visual-basic-net/)
Thanks! &amp;#x200B; Any books that you recommended?
Learning Visual Basic .NET by Rod Stephens from InfiniteSkills thats how i started VB and it was a good start. Check it out, the course will help you in understanding VB. 
this sound like you may be inadvertently bringing the IDE back into the foreground. Try minimizing Visual Studio after running the application and see if you see your window then. 
Better start making small programs. Keep the scope small but learn everything from designing to doing anything. Look for ideas and try to make gui's for them. Here, some of my tools you can copy &amp; try to make more upgrades. Then publish them as your own tools. Get license on github. Image To Icon converter: https://github.com/NyanSniper101/Image-To-Icon Eye Protector(like in mobile phones: greenlight filter but with any color and thickness): https://github.com/NyanSniper101/Eye-Protector Simple snake game: https://github.com/NyanSniper101/Snake-Game-VB.NET Simple virus make with other scripts: https://github.com/NyanSniper101/BhaveshVirusMaker See the source code. Break it, play with it, change it and see what happens. Maybe change look a bit or you can even contribute if you like. Some handy tools: Icons8 desktop app: helps to have icons in ant format and many sizes. Just Color Picker: pick color from any window on screen - very handy! Sometimes you wish you knew that exact color some website or app used! Nuget packages: can find scripts/imports made by other users. They're like packages where u find gui controls, animated stuff, api's etc.. 
Why would you share information on how to make and share viruses? What about that seems like a good idea to you?
Is it possible that the application itself is minimized and you're still just looking at the designer file? The application will open as a separate executable outside of Visual Studio and you wouldn't be able to adjust those kinds of things on it. Look on the taskbar for a new icon after you start debugging.
&gt; I tried using this Yes, that won't work because "file" no longer exists. However if it did, you would just be re-writing over the same file, not appending the pages to the file. &amp;#x200B; Try with this (apologies it could be tidier): Public Sub MergeFiles(ByVal name As String, inputdir As String) Dim OutputFile As String Dim OutputDir As String = inputdir &amp; "\Merge\" If Not Directory.Exists(OutputDir) Then Directory.CreateDirectory(OutputDir) For Each f As String In Directory.GetFiles(inputdir, "*" &amp; name &amp; "*.pdf") OutputFile = GetFileNameWithoutExtension(f).Substring(0, 7) &amp; " " &amp; name &amp; ".pdf" If File.Exists(OutputDir &amp; OutputFile) Then Using ExistingDocument As PdfDocument = PdfReader.Open(OutputDir &amp; OutputFile) Using InputDocument As PdfDocument = PdfReader.Open(f, PdfDocumentOpenMode.Import) For Each page As PdfPage In InputDocument.Pages ExistingDocument.AddPage(page) Next End Using ExistingDocument.Save(OutputDir &amp; OutputFile) End Using Else Using outputPdfDocument As PdfDocument = New PdfDocument() Using InputDocument As PdfDocument = PdfReader.Open(f, PdfDocumentOpenMode.Import) For Each page As PdfPage In InputDocument.Pages outputPdfDocument.AddPage(page) Next End Using outputPdfDocument.Save(OutputDir &amp; OutputFile) End Using End If Next End Sub This will check to see if the output file has already been created (ie. " ZTEST01 Complaint") and will append the next document to it. If not it will create a new one.
Honestly, the way I learned is that i had to. I generally knew how to program, but I started from zero on VB, and learned when I was assigned a project. Start with something you want to make, and just Google every time you hit a wall. 
The project is very badly coded. The viruses generated are simple batch viruses, easily detected &amp; also mostly harmless :) Metasploit is far more dangerous &amp; accepted by everyone ;)
Generates harmless viruses. Easily detected. Old project. It's far less dangerous than metasploit, thats accepted by all ;)
This looks a lot cleaner than what i posted as my edit. I'll fix it right now, because yeah, you were right it was just duplicating the pdf and just renaming it with another file number. Also, the reason i wanted to PM was because this project is a 2 parter. The first module i have splits a PDF by its unique bar codes . Each Bar Code is coded "Coversplit" "Complaintsplit" "Exhibitsplit" "Militarysplit" "Summonsplit" So the output will be: ZTEST01 COMPLAINT 1 ZTEST01 COMPLAINT 2 ZTEST01 COVER SHEET 1 ZTEST01 COVER SHEET 2 ZTEST01 EXHIBIT 1 ZTEST01 EXHIBIT 2 ZTEST01 EXHIBIT 3 ZTEST01 MILITARY 1 ZTEST01 SUMMONS 1 ZTEST01 SUMMONS 2 and thats when your code above comes into play to merge them back by their respective file names. This seems redundant because i feel like i could just have this happen in the first code i have that splits them. This is the first module that originally splits them up into what your code merges them back into: Option Infer On Option Strict On Imports Bytescout.PDFExtractor Imports System.Collections Imports System.Collections.Generic Imports System.IO.Path Imports System.IO Imports System.Linq Imports System.Text Imports System.Threading.Tasks Imports System Imports System.Diagnostics Imports PdfSharp.Pdf Imports PdfSharp.Pdf.IO Module Module1 Class PageType Property Identifier As String Property TypeName As String End Class Sub Main(ByVal args As String()) Dim dir = "G:\Word\Department Folders\Pre-Suit\Drafts-IL\2-IL_AttyReview\2018-09\Reviewed\" Dim unmerged = Combine(dir, "unmerged") Dim pageTypes As New List(Of PageType) Dim ids = {"COVERSPLIT", "COMPLAINTSPLIT", "EXHIBITSPLIT", "MILSPLIT", "SUMSPLIT"} Dim nams = {" Cover Sheet ", " Complaint ", " Exhibit ", " Military ", " Summons "} For Each inputfile As String In Directory.GetFiles(dir, "*.pdf") For i = 0 To ids.Length - 1 pageTypes.Add(New PageType With {.Identifier = ids(i), .TypeName = nams(i)}) Next Dim extractor As New TextExtractor() ' Load sample PDF document extractor.LoadDocumentFromFile(inputfile) Dim pageCount = extractor.GetPageCount() Dim currentPageTypeName = "UNKNOWN" Dim Path As String = IO.Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(inputfile) Dim extracted = Path.Substring(0, 7) ' Search each page for a keyword For i = 0 To pageCount - 1 ' Find the type of the current page ' If it is not present on the page, then the last one found will be used. For Each pt In pageTypes If extractor.Find(i, pt.Identifier, False) Then currentPageTypeName = pt.TypeName End If Next ' Extract page Using splitter As New DocumentSplitter() With {.OptimizeSplittedDocuments = True} Dim pageNumber = i + 1 ' (!) page number in ExtractPage() is 1-based If Not Directory.Exists(dir &amp; "\unmerged") Then Directory.CreateDirectory(dir &amp; "\unmerged") End If Dim outputfile = Combine(unmerged, extracted &amp; currentPageTypeName &amp; pageNumber &amp; ".pdf") splitter.ExtractPage(inputfile, outputfile, pageNumber) Console.WriteLine("Extracted page " &amp; pageNumber &amp; " to file """ &amp; outputfile &amp; """") End Using Next extractor.Dispose() Next ' for reach End Sub End Module So instead of having 2 different modules... couldn't this module immediately do what your code does right after it splits them? 
does anything change if you compile for pcode or native?
When you run the VB6 IDE, do you need to run it "as administrator"? You may need to do the same for the exe if that is the case.
I started doing it and found the problem. There was a Space(somevariable - 1) where somevariable was read from registry but somehow the registry query did not work when not run from the IDE thus leaving somevariable at 0 and Space(-1) caused the error. Thanks for the help to everyone 
and yes Hello @slang4201 I slowly and painfully got this all to work thanks to you. The only thing I am having trouble figuring out is how to select the range and copy paste without doing it the page number way.
I ran some test scripts and it appears that searching for hidden text using a range object doesn't work (at least in Office 2016) - even when specifying Range.Find.Font.Hidden = True. A workaround would be to use the Selection object to perform the search. For that to work, you'd have to toggle the hidden text on first, then off again after the text was found. Word sometimes is a fun thing.
Yeah you could possibly do it with that code although you're extracting the data using classes from one library and merging them with another. If your library that performs the extraction of pages can also append pages to existing PDF files you can do it, sure. You can use similar logic from my code. Although I'm unfamiliar with the extraction library you're using .
Show code. How about calling thread.abort on child threads
bummer. I've partly found a way for it to select all info/text between two defined words, which would work for what I need, but it does not want to use the next strHeader after doing the first. so it's making all the files and folders, but it just copies the same information for the second one. Does the function act as a separate instance and not update the strHeader? Do I have to somehow link them or redefine it better?
You'll probably have to step through the code line by line, and see why the GrabPageContents function isn't returning new text. That being said, I would use this construction to call the function (after Dimensioning PasteRange): Set PasteRange = GrabPageContents(myRange) and Function grabPageContents(theRange As Range) As Range
Basically, How do I add a count to this? theRange.Select Set rng1 = ActiveDocument.Range If rng1.Find.Execute(FindText:=strHeader + "S") Then Set rng2 = ActiveDocument.Range(rng1.End, ActiveDocument.Range.End) If rng2.Find.Execute(FindText:=strHeader + "E") Then strTheText = ActiveDocument.Range(rng1.End, rng2.Start).Select Set grabPageContents = strTheText End If End If End Function
As I read the code, it should be incrementing through each row of the table, and assigning the contents of the first cell in each row to strHeader. Then looking for that text with your function in the body of the document past the table. I would step through the code and look at the values at each point where it should be changing (or put watches on the variables), and see why strHeader is not either changing, or getting passed to the function incorrectly. 
You are correct in concenating the two strings. As for finding, the process will search for “123S” or whatever your strHeader value is, from the end of the table to the end of the document, stopping at the first one found. If you want it to find the same string further down the document, you’ll need to iterate through the find process. 
Can you seriously not see the pattern in those numbers? If not, I'm not sure this is the career for you.
No need to be like that, sometimes we overlook or miss the obvious
No I figured it out. nvm
Writing a program in Visual Basic in C++? Impressive.
I haven't done office integration with .net yet, but you should be able to open the sheet and loop the rows. it's just strings, prepend a path do whatever you need.
This is what i tries so far: Dim excelApp As Excel.Application Dim WB As Excel.Workbook Dim WS As Excel.Worksheet Dim target, subRange As Excel.Range Dim workbookpath As String = "C:\Users\XBorja.RESURGENCE\Desktop" Dim workbookName As String = Combine(workbookpath, "xavier.xlsx") 'open Excel to normal state excelApp = New Excel.Application() excelApp.Visible = CBool(Microsoft.Office.Core.MsoTriState.msoTrue) excelApp.WindowState = Excel.XlWindowState.xlNormal 'open workbook WB = excelApp.Workbooks.Open(workbookName) WS = CType(excelApp.ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets("Sheet1"), Excel.Worksheet) WS.Activate() 'get the range excelApp.Range("Sheet1!A:A").Select() target = CType(excelApp.Selection(), Excel.Range) Try excelApp.ScreenUpdating = False excelApp.DisplayAlerts = False Catch ex As Exception MsgBox(ex.Message) Finally WB.Close() excelApp.DisplayAlerts = True excelApp.ScreenUpdating = True 'close excel excelApp.Quit() ReleaseObject(excelApp) ReleaseObject(WB) ReleaseObject(WS) ReleaseObject(target) excelApp = Nothing WB = Nothing WS = Nothing target = Nothing subRange = Nothing 'run garbage collector GC.Collect() End Try So i'm trying to do this with my other code so that it can read the target (the selected column of values) Dim dir = "G:\Word\Department Folders\Pre-Suit\Drafts-IL\2-IL_AttyReview\2018-09\Reviewed\" 'Dim inputfile = Combine(dir, target) Dim unmerged = Combine(dir, "unmerged") ' Set up a list of the identifiers to be searched for and the corresponding names to be used in the filename. Dim pageTypes As New List(Of PageType) Dim ids = {"COVERSPLIT", "COMPLAINTSPLIT", "EXHIBITSPLIT", "MILSPLIT", "SUMSPLIT"} Dim nams = {" Cover Sheet ", " Complaint ", " Exhibit ", " Military ", " Summons "} For Each inputfile As String In Directory.GetFiles(dir, *target*, "*.pdf") For i = 0 To ids.Length - 1 pageTypes.Add(New PageType With {.Identifier = ids(i), .TypeName = nams(i)}) Next I put "target" in asterisks and its telling me that i will get a runtime error converting Range to String
You can import an access defense into sql server, just Google that. Then it'd be a matter of changing the connection. Note if it's set up properly that's in one spot. However my experience with legacy stuff using an access database means it's probably not. In that case, it's a matter of using find and replace and finding all the connections and replacing them with a global connection string. Obviously you'd want to test everything before doing this in production as access sql doesn't always translate to raw sql ver batim. If you are thinking this was going to be easy, it won't. Things like this are generally a pretty big undertaking
Note that I'm a TOTAL beginner in all programming lang. I've tried to find the connections, but without success.
Well that would be step one then. Do a search for your access defense file name and see if that comes up anywhere. If you know any of the table or column names you could search for those as well and then back trace to where the connecting gets open. I'm curious as to why you have to move to sell to connect into whatever the third party thing is you're talking about. This is by no means meant to be a slight on you, but you seem woefully inexperienced to be doing something like this. If you're doing it to learn that's great, but if this is some sort of software critical to a business, be careful
Ahh gotcha. Honestly this seems like a pretty big deal for an intern! If you've found the Dao/ado stiff they have to be getting a connecting string from somewhere. It's literally a stiring that says here is where the database is and here's how you connect. So searching for the db name would be a good first step
Thanks! A collegue almost had the sollution, but gave up because he's a whimp... So I've got all of that information on where all the connection strings are. He wanted to do it the easy way and connect it trough Access into SQL. Now this was twice as slow, and this vb is of high importance. So I need to find a propper way thats also atleast as fast a the current one.
Hey, Rocket-Reatre, just a quick heads-up: **collegue** is actually spelled **colleague**. You can remember it by **-ea- in the middle**. Have a nice day! ^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
I'm just shooting from the hip but have you tried an oledb provider?
delete
Yes. ADO is actually a wrapper for oledb. That's why it came to mind
It works in pretty much the same way as ado. You'd just change what provider you're using. Sorry I don't have any code samples because it's been years since I've used that. Most people use some form of modeling framework like linq or entity framework. But that would require a complete rebuild for you
`Directory.GetFiles()` only takes 2 params, a path and a search pattern. you need to loop over `target` and process each one. each target is a single file name right? you wouldn't need to loop over GetFiles in that case. 
unless you've gotten into some weird old docs, ADO is actually the newer one, but it may also matter which VB version you're using. ADO shouldn't make the Access db slower. you should actually see almost no speed difference at all.
the same way you'd do it with any string variable.
how would you do it with the file name as a simple quoted string? same way. IDK even know what Combine() is.
Ok so i basically did this with trial and error doing Directory.__whateverhere__ and the solution is this: Module Module1 Class PageType Property Identifier As String Property TypeName As String End Class Sub Main(ByVal args As String()) Dim xlApp As Excel.Application Dim xlWorkBook As Excel.Workbook Dim xlWorkSheet As Excel.Worksheet Dim range As Excel.Range Dim aCell As Object xlApp = New Excel.Application xlWorkBook = xlApp.Workbooks.Open("C:\Users\XBorja.RESURGENCE\Desktop\xavier.xlsx") xlWorkSheet = xlWorkBook.Worksheets("sheet1") range = xlWorkSheet.UsedRange Dim dir = "G:\Word\Department Folders\Pre-Suit\Drafts-IL\2-IL_AttyReview\2018-09\Reviewed\" 'Dim inputfile = Combine(dir, Obj.value) Dim unmerged = Combine(dir, "unmerged") ' Set up a list of the identifiers to be searched for and the corresponding names to be used in the filename.

Okay? 
youve two public vars of the same name . several times empty the vars redim is your friend &amp;#x200B;
I'm not sure, but it would help if you could actually paste your code in here so we can test it in the IDE and debug it from there. Also ECB is not a safe block cipher.
I tried that and it keeps auto changing it from displayPictureBox.Text to displayPictureBox.ResetText and won't allow me to set it to "Nothing"
Update: Apparently it's not supposed to display the text Nothing, but I need to set the image property to the keyword "Nothing"
Is there not a hyperlink object in win forms? Like using that instead of a label
That's ok I figured it out I was just having a brain fart 😂 all I literally had to do was displayPictureBox.Image = Nothing
:) thank you for the upvote and also coming back to confirm the solution. it can help others. 
Hahaha no worries :)
if i remember every activex recompile changes the reference guid, so keeping it all in a big project is best if you're still actively developing the control
So you think I should mirror the common activex into multiple projects and compile together?
Anytime man! Happy coding! :)
Let's see if I can remember this correctly (I haven't worked on a VB6 library in years) .... If you create a DLL project and set it to use binary compatibility, the IDE will try to block you from making any changes that would break a consumer (the EXE project). For the most part, this isn't a real issue, as you can create more classes in the library, and add more subs / functions, so it's only renaming or rearranging things that will sometimes require a break. If you do need to make a breaking change, you just have to reset compatibility after you recompile, and you'll just have to recompile any consumers of the DLL (but IIRC we would typically recompile all of the consumers anytime we made a change even if we didn't break compatibility). We mitigated some of this by creating several smaller DLL projects that were more specialized (one for UI components, one for networking / FTP / Mail, one for helper functions, etc.) so that breaking changes were far less likely. Really the worst case scenario is that you have to rebuild all of the consumers after changing a DLL project.
You should look for a C++ sub to post in, not a visual basic one.
The preferred way to do this is a database (or file) with a Calendar table. Trying to encode all of the rules for specific holidays is more work than its worth. If you want to do it anyways as a learning exercise, pick one holiday and I'll help you. But you have to do it right and post the rules for the holiday. 
Here's how I'd handle it. Create an Integer variable for each checkbox. When the checkbox.checkstate changes, set the variable to the value that the checkbox represents (if checked) or to a 0. Then call a sub that calculates the value of the variables, without caring what the state of the checkboxes are. 
I'd do it by using For Next loop in a function and iterating through all of the checkbox controls on the form and then calculating the values that way. Like so: &gt; Private Function GetCBTotal() As Integer &gt; &gt; Dim CBCount As Integer = 0 &gt; &gt; For Each Control In Me.Controls &gt; &gt; If TypeOf Control Is CheckBox Then &gt; &gt; If DirectCast(Control, CheckBox).Checked = True Then &gt; &gt; CBCount += 1 &gt; &gt; End If &gt; &gt; End If &gt; &gt; Next &gt; &gt; Return CBCount &gt; &gt; End Function 
Every control has a property called tag. Enter the value you want each checkbox to be in the tag for the given check box then run something like this. Public Class Form1 Private Sub CheckedChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles CheckBox1.CheckedChanged, CheckBox2.CheckedChanged, CheckBox3.CheckedChanged, CheckBox4.CheckedChanged TextBox1.Text = UpdateValue() End Sub Private Function UpdateValue() As Integer Dim Value As Integer For Each ctl In Panel1.Controls If TypeOf ctl Is CheckBox And ctl.checked = True Then Value = Value + CInt(ctl.Tag) End If Next Return Value End Function End Class I through my checkbox's into a panel for easy iteration but you could use the whole form if you wanted as an alternative. I did not bother to check if the value was numeric only in the tag. You may wish to do this. This can easily be extended to as many checkbox's as you need. 
It will work. However it because they are checking for the 'Checked' member in the condition it will throw a MissingMemberException when it loops through to another control that doesn't have the 'Checked' member. To avoid that they'd have to do the following *after* determining that the control is a checkbox: &amp;#x200B; For Each ctl In Controls If TypeOf ctl Is CheckBox Then If ctl.Checked = True Then MsgBox("checked") End If End If Next &amp;#x200B;
Guess I’ve always just assumed because Intellisense didn’t offer it that it was invalid. I’ve always taken the route of defining the object as a Checkbox control like I did in my code above. TIL, thanks.
Defining it is probably better. I would usually prefer that. It ensures that I'm using a method that actually exists at least. In the above example, Intellisense doesn't offer the method because at that stage the object isn't anything specific. It's just been defined as a Control. It lets you call whatever method you want for that control, but you do it at your own risk basically.
A couple of options. 'Year 2000 dim firstYear = new DateTime (2000,1,1) 'Year 2001 dim secondYear = firstYear.AddYears(1) 
I see, Is there any way to run a calculation that disregards the year? meaning it always will look to Jan. 1st, YYYY?

Your right man, we did post almost the same code. That's because I was not paying attention. Sorry about that.
No, it's all good. Just pointing it out.
I am a novice and have no idea. I grabbed this code from another forum, but it never worked on my machine. 
hi. just thinking outside the box.. more of a brain fart. but bear with me.. assuming the posted code (you never said the sauce) is correct and working for others, then i'd have to begin to think about about the languages installed and the region and keyboard and fonts of the local machine... (NO i'm not famiiar with macs. is the code optimised fo a mac? i have no clude about that stuff. ) other thoughts: . a possible answer will be re-run office installation with ALL the options selected. .Comment out the first IF code block. does it hang again on the second IF block? .if a method is NOT found, your code is looking for something the machine doesn't have. Did you paste your code in the right place? Are there any references required that have been omitted? etc .but at the end of the day, go back to the source and just check if anybody else had the same issues. Also, i'd try on a different machine just to be sure. sorry i can't give a full definitive answer my friend. hopefully i've help you narrow down some things. post again with any updates or solutions. &amp;#x200B; 
Try taking out the .me. It should just be obj.property If you can post code that would help

It's not for a silent install though, just a way to get it to install at all.
Yeah, I just saw that. regular install won't work for what I need. I haven't had any issue installing manually. I need it to be silent, so that it can be automated.
doesn't work if I take out the .me
Why automate it. Do you have that many programmers still using VB6 that need deployments?
Not OP, but the company I work for has sixteen of us. It took a lot of work getting my computer working with VB6 after last week’s upgrade to Windows 10. I was lucky enough to be the first of our group upgraded. They’re holding off on the rest for now. 
What's the reason for keeping vb6 going after all these years? Is it just a management decisions because they don't want to upgrade to .NET? 
I provide support for code that is 10 - 20 years old (several projects) and much of it started out as vb6 code because many of the programmers at that time only knew vb6. Several of these programmers have made it into management and no longer have to worry about the code and most of them have found other jobs where they're comfortable. Now the code is in [VB.NET](https://VB.NET) and I'm fortunately given the freedom to upgrade anything I see fit in these projects and I do quite often. It's nice to see code that was written in the 90's in vb6 now working in Visual Studio 2017 and .NET 4.5.1 (which is as far as we've tried to go as of yet). 
That's brutal. I moved all of my dev environments to VMWare years ago, and just left VB6 in a Vista VM. Luckily we finally retired the last of our VB6 code a couple of years ago, and hadn't actually done much work on it in years (we replaced it piece by piece with .NET over the years).
It was crazy. Copy/pasting ocx and dll and all kinds of other needed files all over the place, registering them, then moving them if the project had errors opening... then finding the projects that had this other ocx and putting it everywhere, and installing all the third party controls from Farpoint, and copying their files all over the place... only to find I couldn’t debug because of missing dependencies that we had to copy over from my coworker’s computer, and around in circles for two days. But we got it working, even got the mouse wheel thingy installed so I can scroll inside the IDE. That really blew everyone’s minds, this is from *before mousewheels existed*. They were initially going to do a virtual machine, don’t know why they didn’t, but whatever. Maybe we’ll begin talking about upgrading this code soon, I just don’t know. It’s a pretty big project that’ll take quite a bit of planning, I’m sure. 
Ok, sorry I was traveling all day yesterday. First off, this line Private verbindung As New MySql.Data.MySqlClient.MySqlConnection("server=localhost;database=firma;uid=root;") You should change that to some sort of global variable, like in a config file or resources file or something. What happens when you have 40 files doing that, then have to change your database credentials, now you're changing it everywhere you put it. So globalize that so you can just change it in one spot, if the need ever arises. Next, whenever you're opening anything, a sql connection, a file, a web socket to an external source, you want to use the "using" function What that will do is handle closing whatever you opened and disposing of it, in case of an error, or you just forgetting to say verbindung.Close() which will eventually happen. So something like this Using myconn As New SqlConnection(connString) 'do sql stuff here End Using Where connString is your global variable for your connection string. I'm also guessing here, but make sure you are using command parameters and not hard coding where clauses. Here is an example on that Using myconn As New SqlConnection(connString) myconn.Open() 'DO NOT DO SQL IN THIS MANNER 'assume user inputis something a user types in from a text box Dim sql = "SELECT * FROM People WHERE FirstName like '" &amp; userInput &amp; "'" Dim cmd = New SqlCommand(sql, myconn) Dim reader = cmd.ExecuteReader() While reader.Read 'do stuff End While 'Do it in this manner sql = "SELECT * FROM People WHERE FirstName like '@input'" cmd = New SqlCommand(sql, myconn) 'this paramatizes the user intput which protects you from sql injection cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("input", userInput) reader = cmd.ExecuteReader() While reader.Read 'do stuff End While myconn.Close() End Using Next, I'm not really sure what your code is doing, as it seems like you're kind of mixing things up, but correct me if I'm wrong, you're trying to populate essentially data about people into a list of "person" objects. That would go something like this Public Class Person Public FirstName As String Public LastName As String Public Address As String End Class And then accessing and populating it Using myconn As New SqlConnection(connString) myconn.Open() Dim people As New List(Of Person) Dim sql = "SELECT FirstName, LastName, Address FROM People" Dim cmd = New SqlCommand(sql, myconn) Dim reader = cmd.ExecuteReader() While reader.Read Dim individual = New Person() individual.FirstName = reader("FirstName") individual.LastName = reader("LastName") individual.Address = reader("Address") people.Add(individual) End While 'now your people object is a list of person myconn.Close() End Using Lastly, you might want to look into entity framework to access your database. That gives you objects for all your table and is pretty much the defacto standard anymore, for accessing data from a DB in .net. Hope that helps! 
I wish you luck in your efforts. 
Thanks, I will take a look at that. I was under the impression that 1002 in this example would be ATI no matter the vendor, then the likes of ASUSTeK etc. who use the chips had a Subsystm Vendor ID which would be 1043. A random PNPDeviceID I found: PCI\\VEN\_1002&amp;DEV\_6740&amp;SUBSYS\_3388103C&amp;REV\_00\\4&amp;EC6F72D&amp;0&amp;0008 \^-Vendor ATI (1002) Device ID-\^\^-Subsystem Vendor - HP (103C) I was hoping to just go from the first part to detect all ATI cards no matter the vendor. Thanks again!

That's what I based my codes off of. They've conveniently left off Nvidia and Intel, go figure. 
Thanks a lot that helped me! 
They both compile to the same IL assembly, have same performance and both are easy. Stop comparing and start doing.
Ay ay captain :D
thx haven't seen this one but it's even less helpful then the link I provided
I usually pick up a new language by doing a search for the basics, for loops, assigning variables, data types, etc. 
I do that too since I'm too lazy to go through the whole introduction explaining the very basics. But the only site that I found was [https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/9978/Complete-Comparison-for-VB-NET-and-C](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/9978/Complete-Comparison-for-VB-NET-and-C) but it's from 2005 and I believe there must be a website out there more up to date. And that is what I'm searching for. Do you by chance know one?
I've been playing with the code you provided, its a really nice example that has helped me understand. I've used it in VB: [https://pastebin.com/f9YHnPS4](https://pastebin.com/f9YHnPS4) When run it does this: &lt;blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/qCFUZLY"&gt;&lt;a href="[//imgur.com/qCFUZLY](//imgur.com/qCFUZLY)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src="[//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js](//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js)" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; If 1002 holds true as in the example it would help simplify things, still no clear answer.
This code should help. it changes US (mm/dd/yyyy) to UK date format (dd/mm/yyyy). I realise that it's not a complete answer, but you should able to 'alter' it to include time and also string.replace certain characters (namely \[ \] ) . Obviously, only work with a copy of the actual file until it works how you want it to! 'Convert US to UK dates in Excel '(Where E44 is the original date to be changed) `=IFERROR(DATEVALUE(MID(E44,4,2)&amp;"/"&amp;LEFT(E44,2)&amp;"/"&amp;RIGHT(E44,2)), DATEVALUE(MONTH(E44)&amp;"/"&amp;DAY(E44)&amp;"/"&amp;YEAR(E44)))`
The similarities between VBA and VB are pretty extensive; seems like it shouldn't be too hard to port the code to Visual Studio VB, and thus create the standalone exe that you want.
I've been doing a bit more research and fiddling with it since making this post and worked out something that may be a lot easier to achieve - a .vbs file that, when opened, will target an excel workbook in the same folder, and run the code that I posted in the pastebin, and then save the file. I don't know how to execute a block of code with a .vbs file unfortunately, I only know how to execute it using the VBA UI with Excel open. Do you know how to run it externally? Here is what I have tried so far: https://pastebin.com/QBKjZ13a
Yeah this is not enjoyable to read mate.
What result do you get? Also need to put some error handling in there fella. Your TryParse is a show stopper if it fails.
well, one way might be to create a .vbs script and use 7zip to make into executable. howtogeek made an article about how to do it actually. [https://www.howtogeek.com/50364/convert-a-batch-bat-script-to-an-executable-exe-file/](https://www.howtogeek.com/50364/convert-a-batch-bat-script-to-an-executable-exe-file/) There are other tools to turn batch etc to .exe but, meh. i know and trust 7zip. (god i've been on this rock too long!) &amp;#x200B; 
I’ve worked through about a half dozen processes in VBS for my current position, and while there certainly is a commonality between that and VBA, I will tell you that I’ve had a hard time finding information particular to VBScript. Even when you put “VBScript” directly at the beginning of any question you punch in to Google, 98% of the time you’ll get results for VBA, because that’s just so much more popular. If you find a good resource specific to VBScript please let me know, maybe I’ve just had bad luck.
The problem is that the workbook is going to be a different one every time. Same format, but different data in it, so I need an external macro to be able to run on any excel sheet in the same folder.
This is what I have so far (and it doesn't work, at all): Set xl = CreateObject("Excel.Application") xl.Workbooks.Open("Report_Winery_Contacts.xls",Default,False) Set sheet=xl.Activeworkbook.Sheets(1) Sub Macro1() ' ' Macro1 Macro ' ' Cells.Select Selection.ClearFormats With Selection .HorizontalAlignment = xlGeneral .VerticalAlignment = xlBottom .WrapText = False .Orientation = 0 .AddIndent = False .IndentLevel = 0 .ShrinkToFit = False .ReadingOrder = xlContext .MergeCells = False End With ActiveWindow.DisplayGridlines = True Range("A:B,G:G,I:I,K:K,M:M,O:O").Select Range("O1").Activate Range("A:B,G:G,I:I,K:K,M:M,O:O,AC:BH").Select Range("AC1").Activate Selection.Delete Shift:=xlToLeft Columns("C:C").Select Selection.Cut Columns("A:A").Select Selection.Insert Shift:=xlToRight End Sub It is all in a .vbs file, and the Report_Winery_Contacts.xls file is the excel workbook in the same folder that I am trying to target. Note that the macro itself works if I use it in the Excel workbook, but like I said in the original post, I want to be able to just click-and-run this file and target a workbook in the same folder.
I still get the same error code: "Cannot use parentheses whencalling a Sub" on Line 2.
I'm unsure exactly what you mean. If you mean the amount of digits you could just do dim count as integer = yourtextbox.text.length -1. If you have numbers separated by spaces you could do something like dim nums as list(of string) = yourtextbox.text.split(" ") and then see how many strings are in your list. Not really sure what you mean by "without the use of commas".
You need to elaborate more
That sounds like it’s erroring here : &gt; CreateObject("Excel.Application") Try this: &gt; CreateObject “Excel.Application" 
like I've said. you put random numbers ina textbox and you press a button that counts each digit from 0 to 9 from the textbox telling you how many of each digit is in the textbox.But I completed the task by using th MID function counting each number by 1 then putting each value into an array. Then from there, i sorted each value from the array using a case function and and accumulated the digits each into a different array function. Then I just posted each value of array into a listbox stating which digits had which count
Is your string divided by commas? like : 1,2,7,9,10 And then count how many numbers there are? Dim Results = "1,2,7,9,10".Split(",").Count
i figured it out
if you want it. message me and I will persoanlly give you the answer
No you are in the clear here. It is recommended to use `&amp;` for concatenation and `+` strictly for addition. You could run into logical errors if you used `+` to concatenate strings together, but accidentally used it with numbers resulting in adding values together instead of concatenation. Whoever evaluated your code may have gotten mixed up after looking at a million of these code snippets.
Thank you for this clear explanation
"Simplest" update I can think of would be to update the machines running the apps, and use a VM to host the older OS and the PLC apps. Otherwise you'll need to contact the manufacturer of the PLC applications to see what they offer with updated software, *and* updating older versions.
I have some experience in this space. The problem I think you will find isn't so much getting the software to run on modern hardware, it is the interface to the PLC / industrial equipment. I had one piece of machinery that had 2 full length 16bit ISA cards that required a special motherboard to be able to upgrade the machine. 
I concur. It looks good to me too. As mentioned it looks like you're using best practice when it comes to + and &amp;. I'm assuming it was graded by a professor that isn't a programmer or a student that is also new to the language.
I've dealt with this - if I didn't have the code for the original system I turned the (in this case) the Win95 machine into a VM and it's been running fine for an extremely long time. Things I had source code for I just re-wrote in C#. If you're dependent on an old OCX for this or that maybe there's a new version available from the vendor. 
I've spent a lot of time in this arena. Your solution is the quickest/best for OP. Virtualize the existing OS/setup with all of its custom PLC drivers, etc and run that in VirtualBox/VMWare workstation on new hardware until such time that a complete re-write can be done. The only exception would be if the custom PLC's require some custom hardware not supported by virtualization. I would recommend that OP re-write the code from scratch in .Net using the original 5.0 only as a general template/guideline as to what needs to be done. The coding practices from the 5.0/6.0 to now so incredibly different as to make salvaging that old code a bigger headache than just starting fresh. Source: Been there, done that
VB6.0
The error message tells you exactly what's wrong. Read it, then think about the following: if the first element in the array has index 0 and the number of elements in the array is given by Length, what would the last element's index be?
Ive got no idea, as i said everything in the private function is gibberish 
No clue, as i said everything in the function is gibberish to me
I'd look at the 0 to array.length 
Yea I’m with this guy ^ man. Do you want to be a programmer or what? That is a simple error (happens to the best of us) but you need to be able to fix it. Look at the range you are letting the array iterate over. They are 0-based, meaning the first index is 0 not 1.
Why use Excel if you're just clearing the file? CSV files are just text, so you can open it, manipulate the text, and save the file. 
Can you help me with that then? I used excel because I knew how to use the built-in cell clearing function. I'm not proficient with editing text files in vba. Moreover, this text file is used for other macros and changing the csv encoding type causes other macros to break. This was the way I found to manipulate the text and keep the file format intact.
My bad, I didn't realize this was VBA (not paying enough attention). I haven't used VBA in many years, so I'd probably cause more problems than solutions. If no one else shows up with any suggestions, you might post over at /r/vba. 
That's what I thought until the other macros didn't work =/ Even though the file type was still .csv and it was an empty file, the other macros were error-ing out when I tried that method (which is the intuitive thing to do)
It is a Status Strip.
Thank you!
Either through status strip, or adding line control and grip icon.
isn't a cleared CSV just an empty file? delete the file and create a new one.
Status Strip or Menu Strip that is docked to the bottom of the form. This one looks like a status strip with no labels or buttons attached. you can generate one a run-time and dock it to the bottom of the form and add controls, I like to have a label on mine that shows a little earth icon that is grayed out if there is no network connectivity.
Thank you for all your input! This helped a lot.
Thank you for your help!
[From the Leap Year Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year#Algorithm) Public Function IsLeapYear(ByVal Year As Long) As Boolean If Not Year Mod 4 = 0 Then IsLeapYear = False ElseIf Not Year Mod 100 = 0 Then IsLeapYear = True ElseIf Not Year Mod 400 = 0 Then IsLeapYear = False Else IsLeapYear = True End If End Function 
Thanks for the reply, but I'm not permitted to use the IsLeapYear function.
Oh sorry, I skipped over the must use case statement portion. That certainly complicates things a bunch. I suppose you can perform the MOD function on the year and use the case on the resulting value like this: Public Function IsLeapYear(ByVal Year As Long) As Boolean Dim Result As Long = Year MOD 4 Select Case Result Case 0: Return True case 1 to 3: Return True Case Else: Return False End Select End Function ---- Apologies if there's any syntax errors, I don't have VS on my current laptop. But I think that should work out.
Pretty sure it’s got to be done using only case statements and the mod function, without any other bits. Is that possible? Thanks for the replies 
Wellll, if you want to cut out the extra stuff, you could incorporate the initial MOD operation into the select case statement: `Select Case Year MOD 4` From there you would be evaluating the results which would only be the values 0-3. If it's anything besides 0 then it's not a leap year. If it's a 0, you would have to perform extra checks on the `Year` itself to see if it's a *valid* leap year. I suppose you could use another case statement here if you're confined to only using them for this additional check.
I don't really understand your logic here. Why are you checking if the year is great or = the current year? Also, can't you just create a date time based on what they passed in and then run that through your is leap year function?
My professor wants to be able to enter a future date, for example Month: 2 and Year: 2031 and have the program display a message if it is a Leap Year or not.
add a newline before the first line of code. you can also use a pastebin or a gist
Just pick project compatibility until you have your public interfaces designed, VB will automatically update the project when it loads. Once your happy switch to binary compatible pointing to your final compile there after you can make fixes to your dll/ocx and recompile with no harm you will only break compatibility if you change the public interfaces
How I overlooked that is beyond me! I moved that code out, and updated the original post with a PasteBin link containing the full code.
I took your advice and uploaded the entire code to PasteBin and updated the original post. Also, added a new line before the first line of code and that didnt change the formatting. Pretty sure this is an ID10T error on my end.
Don't you have a function that checks if something is a leap year?
I know VB has an IsLeap function, but we are unable to use that function. We have to code it with Mod 4, etc... I'd rather use the IsLeap...
You could use an odbc link in excel and get it to autorefresh every x seconds?
Yea I saw that, I guess I was meaning can't you just build a function that returns whether or not something is a leap year, and then just pass in the year. You don't care what month they give you if you're checking if the year is a leap year. this is pseudo but sub isLeapYear(int year) Dim dt = new DateTime(year, 3, 1) 'create a date time with the year and march 1 'this will give us the day before march 1, if that was 29, it means it was feb 29, so it is a leap year, if not, it'll be feb 28 Dim dayBefore = dt.AddDays(-1) return dayBefore = 29 end sub Then you can just call that passing in the year they gave you. You don't care if it was 1950 or 2150
Does it refresh the entire table or is can I get it to refresh every individual cell independenly and move onto the next? Bloomberg Terminal didn't get back to us on the specific issue, but it's probably something with sever issues so it means there's a certain time period before I can move onto each other cell 
You can do either, I did it a few times to query a 50GB SQL table as it was too long to query doing it through the bundled app From what I remember it's dead easy to do, I don't have access to my coding but in the odbc connections there are a few options there to play with, then in excel is where you setup the auto refresh
Awesome! i'll check that out tonight at the office and see if it works out Thanks! 
Unfortunately not. One of my classmates asked our professor if we could do it that way and she said no and that if we had done function like you’re calling out she would actually fail the assignment.
So how are you supposed to know if it's a leap year then?
Per the professor, we use the Mod 4 code and a Boolean. So if Mod is True then the Boolean is set to True. It’s been 20 years since I did anything with VB, and am remembering the migraines it used to give me...
And do you have that function working yet?
Yup, works correctly. Reason I know is that when I had my output statements written previously it was displaying the correct message. Now that I’m trying to compare the year entered by the user to the current year, that’s when I can’t get the output statement to work correctly.
No worries, I’m appreciating the help. Our professor requires that we compare the user entered year and output 2 different messages. One is worded for past tense if the user entered year is before or equal to the current year. The other is worded in a future tense if the user entered year is greater than the current year. I’ve never coded anything like this before and am struggling to understand the code. Unfortunately I haven’t been able to find any examples online, or my Google fu is lacking when it comes down to search for Visual Basic examples.
When is it due? I can help you out better tomorrow
Yea I'll be able to help you out tomorrow when I'm at my pc. I saw your paste bin so I'll just spin that up quick and take a peek
so then what exactly is the issue now? try setting breakpoints and make sure the values are what you think they are.
loop, compare 4 characters at a time. sounds like homework. what have you tried?
Can you give me a code example?
for your homework? no. you give us a try and we'll steer you. one of the things showing your attempt doe sis let us know what level you're working at. if I give you something with no context it's possible to be beyond what you're supposed to be using and your teacher will know you're having other people write it for you. 
True, alright. Gimme a second 
that's a useful loop over mid example, but now you need to read 4 characters instead of 1, and compare it to your list of words
alright, thanks. I'll give it a try
Ok a couple things. You already do a int.tryparse so in your if statements, the CInt function is redundant because you already know it's an int, via the try parse you did. Second, I think you have a copy and paste error. Both messages say had. You if statements would technically work, but they all say had as opposed to has. Lastly, they're both greater or less than, and equal to. Having them both with the equal to means they would both technically be true if the year is the current year. You want &lt; for anything in the past, but &gt;= for anything in the future. 
I removed the CInt function per your advice. Yup, totally missed the copy paste error (lack of sleep) and made some corrections on the wording. I set the operator to &lt; for anything in the past as well. However when I test the updated code with Month: 2 and Year 2012 it is displaying " had days in the year 2012 and was Not a Leap Year!" Yet, I know 2012 was a Leap Year. Same behavior if I do a future date. Obviously something is screwed up somewhere in my code. [New PasteBin with Updated Code](https://pastebin.com/03wrW9vA)
Oh that's not it. It's your nested ifs. You have If intYear Mod 4 = 0 Then If intYear Mod 100 = 0 Then If intYear Mod 400 &lt;&gt; 0 Then Basically what you did there is saying it has to be divisible by 4, 100, and 400 to be true. What you want is if any of those are true, to set blnLeap to true. So don't nest the if statements, put them in an in else chain
OP doesn’t respond. Lol. “What did you see DENVERCODER9?!?”
 If intYear Mod 4 = 0 Then blnLeapYear = True ElseIf intYear Mod 100 = 0 Then blnLeapYear = True ElseIf intYear Mod 400 &lt;&gt; = 0 Then blnLeapYear = True Something like that?
That would work. You could also do one if statement with ors 
For those like me who didn’t have a clue: https://xkcd.com/979/ 
So I modified the code to the above, yet my output still doesn’t work correctly. I feel like I’m missing something obvious.
Is your paste bin updated?
didn't work :/
[Updated PasteBin](https://pastebin.com/7JUJVNF2)
You still have them all wrapped in an if &lt;&gt; 0 those are never going to get hit because they're in that. Are you using visual studio?
Yes, we are using Visual Studio 2017. According to our assignment intYear Mod 400 is not supposed to equal 0, the operator is &lt;&gt; according to my professor and the textbook.
You were right, I had that bit of code wrong. I was trying to declare blnLeapYear as true when it needed to be declared as false. As soon as I made the change, the output showed correctly. Dyslexia and programming do not mix! I really appreciate the help!
Worth a shot. 
I'll do it for $500.
Is c:\b shared out from the target machine as its own share, or is the entire C drive of the target machine shared out? What are the permissions for the remote share? Is the folder AND the share itself configured with permissions that would allow your program to access it?
You can use Form1.Close() to close the form instead of just hiding it. Not sure how you have the forms set up but if they are separate from each other you could make a button called close and when pressed it runs Me.Close() to close the form it’s on. 
They need to remember to adjust the application settings to close on last form, rather than when the first form is closed.
Removed, spam. Reported to site admins.
Come on man, you expect people to decrypt that mushed up code?
You are using the plus symbol, +, and vb uses the ampersand, &amp;, to join string. &amp;#x200B; Also, yea, don't post this level of hell. Show us the exact line(s) where the issue is, otherwise people are going to simply think; "no way, I'm not digging in to this"
For reference, VB allows both if it's two strings concatenated, but it is best practice to use ampersand. "abc" + "def" = "abcdef" "abc" &amp; "def" = "abcdef" "111" + "222" = "111222" "111" &amp; "222" = "111222" "111" &amp; 222 = "111222" "111" + 222 = 333 "abc" + 222 = conversion error
Please reformat your code in this post by indenting each line of code with four spaces at the beginning.
I stared with VB 2.0, and through .net (before switching to c#) and never knew this. Thanks for the heads up. I would prefer that in all of .Net that ampersand would be for strings and plus would be for math... but that's me. Have a great weekend
I'm assuming that the vb project exe file is a console app? Do you have control over the command line arguments or does it have to be input from the console while running? 
the project is a windows form app.
Then it looks like your best bet is to add command line options. You can read the command line arguments from inside your application with My.Application.CommandLineArgs. It's a list of strings which represent each item on the command line. 
&gt;My.Application.CommandLineArgs how do i use it?
What does your bat file look like? What exactly are you trying to accomplish? 
Why is it spam? I am posting a link of a guy who used Visual Basic to build a business. I thought that some of you would enjoy it.
The goal is to have my vb project open the .bat and have the vb project input a 3 and hit enter so the .bat runs the third option. all without the user having to select the option. I can my vb project to run the .bat with Process.Start("file.bat") but I can't figure out how to get the vb app to input into the open .bat process.
Look at your user history and then look up the reddit rules regarding spam. 
Ah, that makes sense. I apologize for the misunderstanding. I think there is a way to do this. Give me a minute to find the example online. 
Here is an example in C#. Basically you change the user to Imports and remove the semicolons. https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/46c91711-755f-48fa-a4a8-92956082218f/howto-launch-process-and-write-to-its-stdin?forum=netfxbcl
thanks the example worked after some meddling
Take the multiline input like you did. Store each line in array, then perform whatever conversion. After than run loop to just dump array into another multiline textbox.
how to access different line of text box as different val in array? is it TextBox.Lines or TextBox.Lines(5) \*as in line number 6 ?
XNA was replaced by Monogame, they have a bunch of VB stuff there. http://www.monogame.net/
Thanks this is a great help
Used the checkedchanged event
Dim myArr As String() = MyTextbox.Lines Array starts with counter 0, so the first line will be myArr(0). If you want line 6, then it'll be myArr(5).
i dont have to specify that how many element is in myArr? 
On mobile, so cant test it. But the error is because there is no item at the index number in array.. this happens if for loop is not properly incremented. Better to do: For Each line As String in myArray .. .. and let vb increment without you declaring counters. If u want counter, be sure about last index number. Or simply put one inside for each loop.
Then change the label/text/caption in the event yes. 
That’s correct 
Have you checked what’s inside that folder?
I think you need to create the folder yourself, but I'm not sure.
Rebuild the project maybe.. By default, every vb and c# project makes it when you click 'Debug' or run.. 
use the mid() function? unless your classwork leads to using something else...
 BinaryNumber = "10110101" BinaryNo1 = (Mid(BinaryNumber,1,1)) BinaryNo2 = (Mid(BinaryNumber,2,2)) Etc Would that work?
 Dim input as string = "10110101" For Each element As Char In input Console.WriteLine(element) Next
Yes there is a string-to-array function. It is: Split(&lt;string&gt;, &lt;delimiter&gt;)
Don't see how that's going to work in this case. There's no delimiter to split on.
Use Mid, and a for-loop.
OMG you’re right. You can also use the string Left and Right functions.
Yea there are a number of ways to do it. If it were me, I'd just to a for loop with string .length and substring Dim someString = "foobar" For i As Integer = 0 To someString.Length - 1 Step 1 Dim letter = someString.Substring(i, 1) Next
First, if you are doing decimal math, don't use integers. Integers are whole numbers only. Declare your variables as Double or Decimal instead of Integer. You need to convert your text strings to a number before you can do math with them. Use Val(txtPackageA.Text) instead of txtPackageA.Text Finally, when assigning a number back to a text box, you need to convert it back to a string. Like this lblPackageA.Text = (Val(txtPackageA.Text) * PackageA).ToString 
It looks as if in the first screenshot, the numbers have just been merged . This might be because you have to change the values to integers before calculating as it looks as if it has just merged all the strings with integers. You can do this with: Cint(packageAtxt) This is so that only integers and integers are calculated not integers and strings
Thank you! I have corrected those mistakes but I still am having problems with the correct grand total: lblGrandTotal.Text = ((Val(txtPackageA.Text) + Val(txtPackageB.Text) + Val(txtpackageC.Text)).ToString just shows the total to be 210...
Hi! I have applied this in the following: Dim PackageAResult As Integer Dim PackageBResult As Integer Dim PackageCResult As Integer PackageAResult = CInt(lblPackageA.Text) PackageBResult = CInt(lblPackageB.Text) PackageBResult = CInt(lblPackageC.Text) lblGrandTotal.Text = PackageAResult + PackageBResult + PackageCResult The sum in the lblGrandTotal, however, showed up as 210 :(
But 15 + 75 + 120 = 210
I think the code added up the wrong numbers, I will have a look later
&gt; PackageBResult = CInt(lblPackageB.Text) &gt; &gt; PackageBResult = CInt(lblPackageC.Text) You have two times PackageB here 
But how would you do that? Use a array? 
Your calculation is wrong. The output you got (210) is the sum of the quantity sold. Correct it so that it uses the package value.
I've got some pointers for you: 1. I would encourage you to put option strict and option explicit on. It's not necessary but I don't like relying on implicit type conversions. 2. Don't use your GUI elements in your calculations. I've been burned on that one. 3. You have your calculations inside each of your if statements. Determine the discount then do the calculations. The more places you write your calculations the more places you can write it wrong. 4. You need to copy and paste all your code even if it is similar because you could have made a mistake when typing it, and people will want to paste your code into the IDE to run it themselves
If you downloaded or cloned the repository this weekend, please do it again, I added .gitattributes so GitHub correctly understand VB6 binary files 
Wouldn't it be easier to post your questions here and collate the answers? Also, are you absolutely sure you *want* to learn VB? As someone who actively writes VB in my job, I would strongly recommend you learn a different language like C# instead.
I am actually pushing new developers to Javascript or Python these days, Microsoft has made it clear that VB dead is not a priority.
I know Javascript and I am confidence with it but I want to learn a simple language like VB and it's requirement for my degree. I might learn C# later on but for know I will stick on visual basic. I wouldn't mind doing it here I just to interview a person not a group of people, I can do it with multiple people but I would have to chose only one at the end. 
vb.net isn't really a simple language anymore. it's just about as complex as C#, but it brings a lot of legacy syntactic sugar along that really just gets in the way with modern programming. the main reason to learn VB.net is to maintain existing projects, an if you know C# you're 95% the way there as it's mostly just the .net framework you need to know. vbscript/vba on the other hand, you do need that to do some advanced Office stuff, and it's basically a completely different language these days.
So, if I am someone in 2018 knowledgeable in VB the then the only job I will get is in old rusty stores that still use VB and my main job is to simply maintain them? What I don't understand is why can't VB be modernized like how other programing languages are?
Please don't misunderstand, I love VB. The two main reasons I am not pointing new developers to VB are; 1) There are few jobs that ask for VB. Python is number 3 on the most requested languages and it has a similar intent as VB. Javascript is probably the most common if you take into account web development. Java is considered the most common language still if you want to get technical but Java is a bear to learn. 2) Industry negativity. I have for years tried to explain the benefits of VB over complex languages like C++, Java, and the like. The industry has always frowned upon VB as the "Retarded younger brother" of programming languages. Microsoft has also treated the VB community as if they want it to go away for years. Even now they are migrating Excel, and word away from VBA to Javascript. 
Comparing JavaScript and VB.NET doesn't work for various reasons, but the biggest reason is that only one company develops VB, whereas JavaScript is developed by many companies and individuals. If one company decides to stop developing JavaScript, its evolution doesn't suddenly grind to a halt since ECMAScript will keep going. Now, what makes VB a bad language for new developers to learn... Firstly, you should read [this article](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/02/01/the-net-language-strategy/) by Mads Torgersen. Written last year, it states that VB.NET will no longer be actively co-evolved alongside C# but will instead see fewer, and more high-level changes. * The ecosystem is quite small and is mainly 'legacy' developers. These are usually developers working in a company where it makes little or no financial sense to migrate to a different language or platform. * Support is extremely limited. Microsoft's own VB.NET documentation is somewhat behind the curve when compared to C#. If you need help with your code, your best bet is to search for it in C# and then work it back into VB.NET. I'm speaking from years of personal experience here but because I'm fluent in both languages, it's not a big deal. For new developers, the curve is going to be larger * Slow development of new language features. This has been the biggest issue for me over the years. When string interpolation and null-coalescencing finally got brought into VB.NET I was excited, but then came Microsoft's announcement and, well, I don't think we'll see many if any more improvements now. * Lack of cross-platform compatibility. Mono finally got a compiler in May this year but it's still very much a work in progress and I think only one person is dedicated to it. 
Because Microsoft no longer wants to develop it, and have [publicly stated this](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/02/01/the-net-language-strategy/). If you want to learn VB, okay, but you will find your opportunities severely limited vs jobs working with C#. If you learn both VB.NET ***and*** C#, then you might find yourself in a good niche working with companies to migrate their code over to C#. And since VB.NET is considered a legacy language, it's quite possible that one of those rusty old stores would pay more money because there are fewer developers willing or able to work with the language.
Two languages with a great future ahead of them. Python is actively taught in UK schools, and JS has now extended beyond the web.
if you learn C#, picking up the differences in VB.net will be trivial. the whole point of VB is to be like the old BASIC. vb.net is MS's attempt to modernize it, and in doing so it's no longer simple. it keeps some of the simple formatting, but adds so many new complexities that it's almost C# without curly braces. 
&gt; **Visual Basic 2018** There is no such thing, latest version is Visual Basic 2017, code named VB 15.0. And yes, it supports consuming or exposing webservices. However, if your task would be to create an interface serving XML to a 3rd party, consider using WCF or WebAPI approach instead. &amp;#x200B;
this is actually something on my radar, and has been for a while. this is basically what I've decided to do https://www.infoq.com/news/2009/12/Migrating-VB6-to-.NET for smaller programs, I'm just rewriting them in C#, and that's my step 1 to become more familiar with .net. it's been a slow process as i don't really have time set aside for it and get interrupted for months on new apps. step 2 I'm not anywhere near yet. for the larger complex apps I plan to use the interop toolkit and start coding chunks of the features, one form or tab at a time, in .net and hosting that as activeX back in the vb6 app. then once enough is done that there's basically just a shell of a vb6 app, I can move it all to native .net. the conversion systems are tempting, but conversion needs a lot of cleanup, and that's tedious work. every time i have to some old code it seems I find something to refactor. rewriting fixes that entirely. I'm sure I'll do C# for all the rewrites. VB doesn't get the same support, and it's not that much harder to learn at all. as for web services, you have all of .NET and it's add-ons and libraries. webservices are trivially easy compared to VB6. 
If you use VB6, then I would not expend any effort on migrating to VB.NET. Instead migrate to C# or another language if you can. The reason for this is that [VB.NET is no longer being actively developed by Microsoft](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/02/01/the-net-language-strategy/).
I glanced over that article and didn't see where it made mention of VB.NET no longer being developed. Where did you see that?
That is complete nonsense. Where at all there does it say they are not actively developing VB anymore? If anything it says the exact opposite. The only thing VB.NET isn't getting is co-evolution with C#. This means C# is king for .NET and they aren't going to worry about if VB will get a feature or not when developing it for C#. Most new "features" over the last few years have just been syntax shortcuts and ways to reduce code, not groundbreaking new language features that are must haves to be able to accomplish specific tasks. 
I'd change the timer to whatever interval you want to update the progress bar / label, and then keep track of where you are in the minute (pseudo code warning): private ticksPassed as integer sub timer_tick() if ticksPassed &gt; 60 then end sub
Be sure to post if you have any questions re hosting forms / tabs / usercontrols, or exposing the .NET code to COM to be consumed by VB6. This is exactly the process we used between 2005 and 2015 to migrate a very large set of VB6 libraries and programs to .NET (while growing the entire system dramatically in .NET at the same time), and it worked very well for us overall.
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vbteam/2017/02/01/digging-deeper-into-the-visual-basic-language-strategy/
Still not seeing it, I dunno. I'll re-read it at home.
My instructor said that VB can be used to make phone apps but with a different framework is that true? And how good is it? Also, is VB script useful in real world application or is it a simple scripting to automate something?
Intersting, do you think VB will die just like Cobal and other languages
Well since Cobol is still a thriving ecosystem I hope it does. VB will never completely go away, the niche will just get smaller and smaller. VB6 is still used a lot, and the amount of legacy code is huge. I don't think it will die in my lifetime.
There are quite a few compatibility shims added into vb.net. If I remember right Visual Studio 2005 could convert directly from vb6 projects to .net 2.0 projects. Then the projects/solutions can be opened in a newer version of visual studio. That's the simplest way to get from point A to point B. Also, consuming web services is much easier I think. But... I don't have that much experience in VB6 to be certain. 
Yes
Many of you guys are saying VB6, what is that is it like a virson of Visual Basic? Is there VB5, 4... and are the difference huge or is it a new version yay?
I heard about Xamarin! Are the apps developed in C# and compiled to Android or IOS useful or are they really slow really small kind of applications?
I'd create a UserControl that represents the new tab that you want to generate. This would include the controls for display and interaction, and the code / variables / properties to contain the data for those controls. After the user clicks "OK", you add a new tab page to the tab control, and create a new instance of that control (in code). Then you add the new control to the tab page, set dock to full, and pass the data to the new control so that it can display the data.
So every time you do the "OK" it passes to a new tab with the information this creating multiple tabs. I like this alot and will try and program that.
Hey, Flurr92, just a quick heads-up: **alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**. Have a nice day! ^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
Never used it myself, so cant say for sure. I'm sure they work well enough though. They have their own framework you have to work within. That way they can translate to both Java and Swift relatively easier than just trying to convert raw .net code.
Thanks! This'll definitely be something to look into. I'm stumped on a solution for this, so even if this doesn't help directly... Maybe indirectly it will!
I have 1-2 years experience using Visual Basic. Unless it is too late, I will be available for an interview from 9am-9pm UTC+12 for the next few days.
Yes VB6 is one of the m oui dr popular version, being released during the Windows XP Supremacy, It is also the last version before the .NET Frameeork, which IIRC has been dropped since 2010, or 2012.
Use a ‘Select Case’ function! &gt; Select Case VariableToEvaluate &gt; Case “A”, “B”, .... “H”, etc End Select Select Case works basically identical to an If statement. If you have multiple conditions to look for, like you are requesting, it treats each one as an ‘or’ statement. (Like below) &gt; if Var = “A” or Var = “B” or Var = “C” etc When it comes to the ElseIf statements, you just insert another ‘Case’ with those conditions listed. For the ‘else’ use ‘Case Else’ 
You never set a value to Interest or Principle, they're both still 0. So you're calculating Principle = 0 * 1 + 0. You need to transfer the value from the text boxes to your variables. Principle = Val(txtPrinciple.text) or whatever you named your text boxes.
Amount = Principal * (1 + Interest) ^ Year ...IIRC
Try using principal = principal * (1 + interest/100) Order of operation in math matters. 
I thought that was it too, but I keep getting $1 for everything so I must have something else wrong along the way. 
When I do this it changes the principle input text box when it calculates
The principle is 0 so anything x 0 will always be 0 no? You either aren’t starting with 1 or you aren’t incrementing, I’d need more information. Remember you can always use the debugger tool which allows you to step through each line of code and see what is actually happening.
I'm actually very new in an intro course. Where is the debugger tool located? Can I use it if the program is running? Like it isn't saying there's an error.
I was mistaken for the txtbox issue. The calculation is definitely wrong though. Year one works then it gets ugly. So you're saying not to add the year exponential at the end?
Yup. If you want to calculate the total amount after 10 years you do startamount * (1+interest /100)^10. Since you want to calculate every single year (to display) you use principal = principal * (1 interest /100) in the loop 
Hearing it explained it makes total sense. I really appreciate it
So I tried select case, and it gives an error on "L" There seems to be some kinda pattern coding that uses L as an identifier, could that be why using ifs/select case doesn't work?
Let me qualify my simple link further. Microsoft made *some* [changes to the language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/getting-started/whats-new#visual-basic-155) as part of 15.5 but they were over a year ago. Since then, there has been a milestone created for '[VB 16.0](https://github.com/dotnet/vblang/milestone/4)' with almost nothing added to it. Indeed, nearly everything then since has been flagged as rejected or 'no plans'. In my comment above, Microsoft said that they would not be supporting Visual Studio as part of their work for mobile (Xamarin), and yet only last month their release had VB support, so maybe there's a glimmer of hope. In terms of the language development though, that really does appear to have stopped. The last changes in 15.5 contained [non-trailing named arguments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/passing-arguments-by-position-and-by-name#mixing-arguments-by-position-and-by-name) and the [`Private Protected` member access modifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/private-protected). I do follow the [vblang repo](https://github.com/dotnet/vblang) as it's a good source of information but if you look at their meeting notes and design propsals, it's clear that they are not interested in continuing development or evolution of the language.
Thanks for clarifying your simple link for my simple mind, I'm grateful for your condescending reply. That does not clearly state that development has been or will be stopped which is what I was looking for in the article. Have a simply great day.
What code have you made so far? Post it so that we can help.
Agreed, start with the total amount. Divide by $0.25, rounding down (use FLOOR), to get the number of quarters. Subtract 0.25 * number of quarters from the total (to diminish it to the amount remaining after issuing quarters). Repeat for $0.10 for dimes then $0.05 for nickels. Multiply he remaining figure by 100 (or divide by 0.01 if you prefer) to get the number of pennies. If you want to loop, you could create an array with (0.25, 0.10, 0.05, and 0.01) to use as your divisor. 
I can at least point you in the right direction, I would assume this is an assignment? If so, I think it's purpose is to teach you about the MOD function. What mod does is returns the number of times something is divisible by another number I.e. 8 mod 2 will return 4, because 2 goes into 8 4 times. It doesn't care about remainders, so 7 mod 2 will give you 3, because 2 goes into 7 3 times, and has a remainder of 1 (which again, it doesn't care about. So what I'm guessing your instructor is after is for you to use that. The psuedocode behind that would look something like this //if the number is greater than 25, we know we need quarters find out how many if change &gt; 25 then num quarters = number mod 25 //don't forget, since we're taking out the quarters, we need to decrease the total amount change = change - (25 * number of quarters) end if Then you would repeat that process for 10, 5, and 1 Hope that helps. If you get some code written I can help you further, just don't want to give you the answer outright or you won't learn! 
shell escaping. you need something more like objShell.Run """C:\Program Files (x86)\Cisco\Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\vpnui.exe"" -s ""loginuser.dat""" also maybe don't assume paths, set the full path to the dat file.
This could be a good use of recursive functions as well.
MOD returns the remainder after integer division, like we used to do as little children before we learned about fractions and decimals. So 7 modulo 2 is 1, because 7 / 2 equals 3 remainder 1. 8 modulo 4 is 0, because 8 / 4 is 2 remainder 0.
You're right, I must have gotten languages confused. 
 math .floor should help The psuedocode behind that would look something like this dim tempResult as decimal //if the number is greater than 25, we know we need quarters find out how many tempResult = change / 25 dim numQuarters = Math.Floor(tempResult) //don't forget, since we're taking out the quarters, we need to decrease the total amount change = change - (25 * numQuarters) Then you would repeat that process for 10, 5, and 1 Hope that helps. If you get some code written I can help you further, just don't want to give you the answer outright or you won't learn! 
If i wanted to shorten it could i use the strVPNClient varable which points to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Cisco\\Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\\vpnui.exe &amp;#x200B; Would this work? objShell.Run ("""" &amp; strVPNClient " -s ""loginuser.dat"""),0,True &amp;#x200B;
you still need to quote paths that have spaces.
Also i left out somthing the command that works is C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Cisco\\Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\\vpnui.exe -s &lt; loginuser.dat &amp;#x200B; Note the &lt; before loginuser.dat
 `' Determine path of the Cisco VPN client (since it could be in "program Files" or "Program Files (x86)" depending on client and OS version.)` `' If there isn't a Cisco VPN client installed, set the path to "none".` `If objFSO.FileExists(SYSTEMDRIVE &amp; "\Program Files (x86)\Cisco\Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\vpncli.exe") Then` `strVPNClient = SYSTEMDRIVE &amp; "\Program Files (x86)\Cisco\Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\vpncli.exe"` `ElseIf objFSO.FileExists(SYSTEMDRIVE &amp; "\Program Files\Cisco\Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\vpncli.exe") Then` `strVPNClient = SYSTEMDRIVE &amp; "\Program Files\Cisco\Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\vpncli.exe"` `Else` `strVPNClient = "none"` `End If` This is what the command looks like that locates it.
So you're pretty close. A couple things. You need to use the int.tryparse method first thing on txtChange.Text. If you were to insert anything but a number in there, your program will error out saying it can't convert it to a number. Second, you have them all declared as doubles, which is fine, but you still need to do math.floor on the C\25 What that will do is get rid of the decimals and just give you whole numbers. Lastly, there's nothing to do for the penny, if there is anything left at that point, it's that many pennies! Let me know if you need more detail on any of those. But good work
Thank you so much!
Formatting a number is done in .ToString when used as a method .ToString(format). Here is some documentation of the format to use. [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-numeric-format-strings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-numeric-format-strings) You probably also need to do an If Then statement for the password button thing. It's not likely that you'll find someone to do your work for you put we might point you in the right direction. 
Thanks for the help! I apologize if I came off as wanting someone to just do it for me, I just need a direction to head in, I don't really know where to start with it. I'll look into that though, thank you!
No, I understand! I've got the whole project done but this one part... My professor has been out sick the past two weeks and our textbook kinda sucks, and VB has been my weakest programming class so far, so I'm just a bit stuck lol. I'm going to read through what you sent me tonight and try to get it working in the morning, would you mind terribly if I message you tomorrow if I'm still having trouble?
Well. I am one of those who learns a lot from reading the solution. When I have the solution I usually explore all corner cases etc and found out why the solution is the solution. So I’ll be glad to show OP the solution if it turns out his brain works as mine. 
I agree. It only really gets me when the questioner doesn't even bother to hide the fact that it's a homework question and just copy+pastes the whole damn assignment onto the sub. I mean, honestly? That's just insulting. 
Yes true. I too learned vb in my school days, but then I was never taught or observed the power of vb. Most new commers say vb is easy because they don't get bashed and told to 'Google' like other communities do. As a result of kids not understanding that VB &amp; C# go the same route, VB community is dying. Technically this subreddit is dead and soon will all of you vb programmers be out of industry is not changed to C# already. No aruments here. VB and C# change to same IL Assembly, so saying C# is better = no technical knowledge how assembler works. VB Community did this to themselves. Because of a not active community, MS is on the verge of disregarding VB. Already the language updates are not on par with C#. Good luck with helping "homework" questions now.
True. Mods have to ban them. Levels should be set for questions. Any basic shit, and ban them. These homework questions have flooded over good genuine help posts.
I’m glad you figured it out. Feel free to message me if you need help in the future. I can’t guarantee a fast reply though. 
&gt;" You mind helping me get this to work? &amp;#x200B; here are what the attributes equal from the last post strVPNClient = SYSTEMDRIVE &amp; "\\Program Files (x86)\\Cisco\\Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\\vpncli.exe" &amp;#x200B; If i need to make one for the .dat file i can. &amp;#x200B; Currently linking it directly to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Cisco\\Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\\vpncli.exe works and launches the CMD. With objShell.Run """C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Cisco\\Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\\vpnui.exe"" -s &lt; ""loginuser.dat""" &amp;#x200B; But it does not include the dat folder and times out. &amp;#x200B; I really need it to be like objShell.Run ("""" &amp; strVPNClient " -s &lt; ""loginuser.dat"""),0,True &amp;#x200B; Or if i make the .dat file like a DIM for loginuser.dat = C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Cisco\\Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\\ so it would be objShell.Run ("""" &amp; strVPNClient " -s &lt; "" &amp; loginuser """),0,True &amp;#x200B; I need it to work with the old script so i can send disconnect commands to the strVPNClient DIM &amp;#x200B;
Thank you very much kind sir!
It's part of a script task in Visual Studio, it is moving data from a text file to a SQL Server table. I'm working on fixing some code to grab more/better data, since the current code misses out on some things because it uses substring(4,1) = "/" which grabs most, but not all columns correctly... 
Just downvote, report and move on?
I don’t mind that they’re up front about it. I do mind when they expect us to do the assignment for them. We should be pointing them in the right direction and letting them figure the rest out in their own. 
I'm on a network with several computers shared with each other. This is how I work this problem. First I make sure that I have a network connection to the shared computer (B:\\) then I navigate to the folder in explorer, but you'll notice that the path shows (B:\\folder\\subfolder) replace the path with (\\\\computername\\folder\\subfolder) and it should work just fine.
&gt;objShell.Run ("""" &amp; strVPNClient &amp; """ -s &lt; """ &amp; loginuser &amp; """"),0,True It seems to be working but its still not feeding in the .dat file and not able to connect.
print it and copy paste and see if that works. does the loginuser var have the full path the dat file? is not, try that too.
Hi guys please make me an app that can mine bitcoin fast with my pentium cpu
I suggest that we create a sub-reddit called VBHomeWork and move questions there. /u/andrewVladmirov your anger at this unfounded. If you want things to be better start adding content. Your statement "you'all will be unemployed" is laughable. This speaks to an immaturity in your own understanding of how developer operations actually work. 
Yes. Set the TEXT property or use the .text from code.
What good is banning someone going to do? The person is likely to make one post here and never return.
Thanks i will try to store in a Constant. I think thats what i was looking for.
openmode.append
where?
I edited to be more specific
i'm fairly new to programming what is .dir and how do I use it? Sorry to bother you. 
You could also do something like put the date or time in the name of the file that you create so it would create a unique file name with the current time or date
If you're trying to store something as a constant maybe you should be using a Label instead of a textbox.
Any reason you can't store them in a database?
yes true :/ maybe pointing them to right reference is best for now..
Probably beyond the scope of their assignment 
I’m pretty sure I’m not gonna be unemployed. I’m primarily a vb programmer, but like any competent programmer I know many languages. Being a good dev isn’t about the language you use. It’s about problem solving. 
Great tip. It's helped me a lot so far. I can't believe how much easier this makes it
I figured out what I did wrong. I did formatcurrency() after my loop. Once I took it off it stopped changing my Principle textbox when I calculated
Well basically you need a global variable that will hold the score, every time they get an answer correct you will add one to it by saying score = score + 1
I am sorry based upon what you have provided us, you are not understanding even the basics. I would suggest that you grab the class book and start reading. We will not write your assignment for you. See sub rules; *Homework questions are tolerated, please be specific about the question as much a possible. Asking us to write it for you is not going to happen. We also reserve the right to not answer if we think you are just not trying.* 
Hey that’s awesome man, glad to hear it :) it really does help pinpoint your errors 
wow i did this exact same project 2 weeks ago
what you need to do is make a label that is invisible until the correct answer is clicked, and then the label displays the score
Even in a small project like this, it's smart to have a plan forward, at least a sketch in your head how components should work together. You COULD of course make 10 different forms with one question in each. This is generally bad practice since you copy the same code over and over and over.. In a very small project it doesn't matter. Making it work is a pleasent experience and important in itself. 😊 Apart from that ; 1) there is no reason to make a new form for each question. Reuse the same form, just replace the question (in the option box) when user clicks next. 2) keep total score as long as the app is running. Usually stored in a variable. 3) remember - if you reuse the option boxes (meaning you replace question after each time user clicks next) you need to have som way to switch around what choice will be the correct one, next time - so option1 will not be the correct answer every time. Good luck! 👍
There's a few ways if you want to google it real quick. I've used Today.Month and Today.Day to return the number dates in naming txt files saved from my program. DateTime.Now returns date and time together. You might need to fix the formatting if you use that for a file name.
What I’m looking to do is when I press my shortcut button it will change the background color of my vb program. I probably can’t do that with the one on windows can I? What all can I do with the normal windows ssh? Also thanks for the help!
I’m so sorry. I’m talking about the new iOS app called shortcuts. I’m wanting to control my computer program from my phone.
Ah well, that makes more sense. So, you basically want to enable OpenSSH server on the Windows 10 machine and then write a [vb.net](https://vb.net) console app that you can run from the command line to change the wallpaper. It's much easier than trying to write an SSH server to do it. Here is a link that tells you how to run the server except you will not have the missing privileges problem. You can just start the service and make it run automatically and it'll be fine. [https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/how-to-install-the-built-in-windows-10-openssh-server/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/how-to-install-the-built-in-windows-10-openssh-server/)
I came up with this but I receive an error as 'system' is a type so therefore cannot be used as an expression. How would I fix it/implement it? &amp;#x200B; System.DateTime.Now.ToString("yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss") &amp;#x200B; filename = "D:\\Programming\\Yearbook Program\\Receipts\\receipts" &amp; System.DateTime &amp; ".txt"
Thank you so much!
&gt;objShell.Run ("""" &amp; strVPNClient &amp; """ -s &lt; """ &amp; loginuser &amp; """"),0,True I have it as loginuser = "C:\\Program Files\\Cisco\\Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\\loginuser.dat"
make a bitmap and use its setpixel, then draw the bitmap on the picturebox? or, use the picturebox graphics drawimage methods?
Good advise, thanks! Pretty sure it was a standard ethernet/RS-232 connection, but I'll need to crack open the machine to double-check.
I'd suggest that (although I like the idea) that the Pi's are out if you have to use MSAccess. If it's using RS232 or RS485 or whatever then yeah download the free P2V (Physical to Virtual) converter from VMWare and then you can use VMWare or VirtualBox to give it a try - doesn't cost you anything other then a few hours to see if it will work :-)
just to make this simpler I have been trying to figure out what I am doing wrong. A colege suggested i did it in CMD since it worked. Set objShell = CreateObject("Wscript.Shell") Dim loginuser, strVPNClient loginuser = "C:\\Program Files\\Cisco\\Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\\loginuser.dat" strVPNClient = "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Cisco\\Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\\vpncli.exe" &amp;#x200B; So far i have tried [objShell.Run](https://objShell.Run) ("cmd.exe -c '""" &amp; strVPNClient &amp; """ -s &lt; """ &amp; loginuser &amp; """'"),0,True [objShell.Run](https://objShell.Run) ("cmd.exe /c '""" &amp; strVPNClient &amp; """ -s &lt; """ &amp; loginuser &amp; """'"),0,True [objShell.Run](https://objShell.Run) ("cmd.exe /k '""" &amp; strVPNClient &amp; """ -s &lt; """ &amp; loginuser &amp; """'"),0,True [objShell.Run](https://objShell.Run) ("cmd.exe /c "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Cisco\\Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\\vpncli.exe -s &lt; loginuser.dat""),0,True &amp;#x200B; I am completely stuck i think its the pathing and i cannot figure it out. &amp;#x200B;
you didn't escape the quotes in the last one.
you change the text on the control by name. Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click RadioButton1.Text = "New Radio Button Text" End Sub
Agreed with BoneJob. it's just a matter of setting the .Text property of the object you wish to display to on the buttons 'click' event. But for the radio button, you proably want to include setting it's "checked" value. (using With, you don't need to keep on mentioning the object.. just the property you want to set. ie: With radioButton1 .checked = "True" .text = "your text here" .forecolor = "Red" end With etc Also theres loads more you can do.. disabling the other radio buttons etc.. Good luck with your project Chronos3434! :) 
Does it have to be a radio button? I think it would make sense to just have a label where you change the text each time your Calcular button is clicked
Almost all controls in vb have .Text property. Change that on click.
Should be. I mean, even if i only try .. say 20 and 18...meaning i should only see one number.. nothing is getting printed. 
Does this help ? https://www.vbtutor.net/VB_Sample/factors%20Finders.html
No problem
Sorry im new to visual basics, would I need to do that in a while loop?
No, each index of the array will be a new question so basically index0 = question1 index1 =question2 and so on. Say your array is Questions[] you would start by loading the first element into the label so label.text = Questions[0] . Instead of hard coding the index we want a variable instead so, Dim index as integer = 0. Label.Text = Questions[index]. Finally when they click the button for the next question we’re going to increment the index so index = index + 1. Since it is now 1 it will be showing the next element of the array.
Awesome I will have to try this tomorrow and see if I can get it too work. I really appreciate your help! I will let you know how it goes!
You aren't. Just want you to do their homework Im assuming
I have the code I just dont have access too it tonight, but the only code I have is just storing my questions as 18 diffrent strings
Awesome, yeah let me know 
Hmm...
Well..i guess i'll try it out on a vm
?
Nah, actually just a side project. I want to learn somethig new.
Only option I can think of would be to import the WSDL in a C# project instead and reference that project from VB. Then you could declare a helper in C# to access ambiguous values from VB, e.g. public enum Foo { A, a } public static class Bar { public const Foo UpperA = Foo.A; public const Foo LowerA = Foo.a; }
Yeah, they have no explicit value assigned to them. The auto generated code looks like Public Enum LanguageCodeType aa AA ab AB ... End Enum ideally would like to avoid a wrapper for something we really dont even need from the API. The Language Code isnt really necessary for our API calls
Meh, on this sub it's usually new people, so it's 50/50 people not realizing they should post code, or your scenario. That's why I asked. 
oh man, thats going to be a lot of typing for an enum we dont even want haha. It's a language code type, with about 300 entries (600 total, 300 uppercase, 300 lower case).
If it is for things you aren't using I would take it out of the autogenerated code.
This thread locked and removed.
lol, my biggest worry was thinking that i would have to make the wrapper for all of the classes and methods the WSDL called that we needed access to if I did it in C#. But luckily, all I needed was the C# class library to reference the WSDL, and then include that in my [VB.Net](https://VB.Net) project, and the [VB.Net](https://VB.Net) can access the WSDL namespace through my C# namespace. &amp;#x200B; So not as much of a headache as I feared.
Awesome got it too work. I put the questions in an array, made the array to read an integer, then made each button click add +1 to the interger. I really apprciate the help man! 
Nice! Good work, no worries 
Thanks! Now I just gotta do that for the answers, for the questions!
You could use a 2d array for that
So if you make it a 2d array instead of just have a row of elements it will have a row and columns. You can put your answer in the first index of the second element (column) Array[row,column] 
This Quests.txt file does it have a specific structure? Can you give an example ?
I'm not a VB expert, but I know I have a project that utilizes ReadAllLines. Until I can look at that for confirmation, does result need to be declared as an array of strings? Dim result As String() 
When using a StreamReader, you must instead call [ReadToEnd\(\)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.streamreader.readtoend?view=netframework-4.7.2#System_IO_StreamReader_ReadToEnd). [ReadAllLines\(\)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.file.readalllines?view=netframework-4.7.2) is a method of the File class. For your situation, File.ReadAllLines() should work for you, but you'll need to change result to a string array, and you won't have to loop through Quest.EndOfStream, but instead loop through the string array. The link above has an example of how to do that.
Okay, I'm using File.ReadAllLines in my code. Not sure if that's helpful or not. So my snippet looks like: Dim prefContent prefContent = File.ReadAllLines(path) For Each str As String In prefContent .... Next
Stream reader seems overkill for this. If all you are doing is dumping a file into a string, then try this: Dim result As String = My.Computer.FileSystem.ReadAllText("..\..\..\Quest.txt") 
What language is this in? You mention a file object, so that leads me to believe this isn't in VB.NET. Can you post the code that creates directories currently?
File.Create returns a FileStream You can use the stream immediately, but if you don't you should be calling close on it. (I see the .Dispose call, but that doesn't guarantee an immediate close / release of the stream). How are you using the file later? Most of the stream readers will create a file if it doesn't exist, so .Create probably isn't needed. 
`Stream.Dispose` and `Stream.Close` are the same thing.
Now it fails here Dim writeReader As StreamWriter = New StreamWriter(Form1.SaveFileDialog1.FileName &amp; ".tmp") &amp;#x200B;
Fails how? 
Says that it is being used by another program
Whenever you're "opening" anything (stream, file, connection to db, etc.) you should use a using. It does some fancy stuff to try and make sure things get closed. using writeReader As StreamWriter = New StreamWriter(Form1.SaveFileDialog1.FileName) 'do anything you need to do with the stream writer end using 'do other stuff
I did think of this but my program will rapidly edit file from multiple places so I don't want to slow it down
&gt; I did think of this but my program will rapidly edit file from multiple places How are you going to ensure data integrity then? I.e. it gets opened from place A and B at the same time. A adds a line and saves, but when B opened it, that line wasn't there, B adds a line later and saves, thus overwriting the changes A made, so they get lost. The whole point of opening it to edit and and locking the file is to prevent that. What problem are you trying to solve here, from a non technical standpoint? I might be able to help you find a different solution. 
Thanks, its working now, but I still don't understand why it didn't want to work the other way.
Yea I couldn't tell you on the technical aspect of why, but I'm assuming calling dispose on the create method probably wasn't actually disposing of it. Keep in mind the using clause is something you should just get in the habit of using whenever you're opening something. 
I'll grab it today, work machine can't reddit.
Thanks for taking your time out of your day to help me, I got the program running the basics and just gotta fine tune it. Thank you so much for your help! I really apprciate it!
&gt;I did think of this but my program will rapidly edit file from multiple places so I don't want to slow it down Why do you think that would slow it down? `File.Create` creates a new stream, and you dispose it in the end. Doing that inside `Using` does the same thing. The way you're going about this is wrong though. If you are rapidly editing a file you should be keeping the stream open and queuing the writes. 
Did you use 2d array? I forgot to reply but it’s basically so every second element of the question Question[0,1], Question[1,1], Question[2,1] etc will be the answer and it’s attached to the question in a sense. You can always message me if you need help with anything. 
Yeah that would work too, the total? If they are right you can just add one to a total variable 
Its actually a survey but thats basically what I did, the questions you answer are on a point based system, and then a total at the end is given to show what category you fit into.
I'm not sure how to do it, but I found something that might help. I'm assuming that if you want a macro, you're using vba (visual basic for applications). VB wouldn't be too different. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26561527/vba-to-copy-website-data
Do you generate the forms dynamically? If not, sheesh but you could use a random number generator and then access the control group? Is even 600 forms managable?
I'm not sure but it's a project i'm trying to work on. Essentially what i want it to do is click the generate button and pop a random game form up with info on that form that the user may click on like the picture above. Do you think there's a better way for me to do this or?
Better use user-controls.. You dont want to design so many forms..
Very excited to test this out tomorrow thank you so much I’ll post an update on how it goes 👍🏻
Welcome. Also create template like control. Then programitically create them for each list item.. Dim myControl As New usercontrolname myControl.Location = New Point(x,y) myControl.size = new size(width, height) form1.controls.add(myControl) myControl.visible = True myControl.BringToFront() myControl.myTextbox1.Text = "" .. .. 
How does the program know what text you want copied from the web page?
Open the folder that the resx file is in. Right click on the file and go to Properties. There should be an Unblock checkbox... Click it then click Apply
you're at a loss on how to declare variables? nothing here we can answer. post what you've tried. we're not your homework for you from scratch.
Oh I don’t want my homework done for me!! Sorry if I made it sound that way. I am having a hard time with declaring my variables. Mainly with how to write the Dim statement. 
`dim myVar as double` seriously, post what you're trying. 
Ill help give you a little head start. Add a button to your form. Change the text property to something like 'calculate' Change the name property to 'btnCalc' Double click that button and the code window will pop up. Inside the button-click method.. DIM dblRoom1 As Double = CDbl(txtRoom1.txt) Where txtRoom1 is the name of the text box on the form where the user enters a value
&gt;How does the program know what text you want copied from the web page? &gt; &gt;i want the program to copy the text i choose...
I tried that, still not working 
What are you using to write your code? Are you using a plain text editor like Notepad in Windows or some kind of IDE (integrated development environment) like Microsoft Visual Studio? I recommend the former if you're serious about learning to program. It will be a bit more difficult, but the payoff will be bigger in the long run. If you're just having a go and just need to pass the class, Microsoft has a community version of their massive Visual Studio editor. It has a bit of a learning curve, but it makes simple programs almost effortless as far as programming goes. It sets up templates and suggests answers. In short, it's pretty much cheating yourself if you're in it to learn. Once you are able to determine how your editing, this makes a difference on how to go about writing the rest of your program. It seems like you were able to figure out some basics enough to create a form to start making controls on. If you typed it all in or just copied it from a book, then you will see that many of the user interface elements you created, like the text boxes, are themselves variables. Now that you have these, you might study what types you need for the rest of your programs. If you search around the internet, there are a massive amount of resources for learning to program. I would definitely browse around http://developer.microsoft.com and look at the Visual Basic resources there.
The only other thing I can think of is for you to move the resx file to another folder, create a new empty resx file then using something like Notepad or Notepad++ copy/paste the contents from the old file into the new file. &amp;#x200B; When I had the same issue on my computer I had to go to each resx file that Visual Studio complained about (there were 2 of them) and unblock each file... Maybe check that too?
Thank you for your feedback! I’ve changed the if statement to what you’ve said above and it’s still outputting the amount of names in the entire list, 102. Would I need to check against strTeam instead of intCount?
Or you can use the same intCount for your counter but change your forl oop to be For i = 0 to lstbox.items.count - 1 and check the name against If strTeam = lstBox.Items(i).toString()
That worked! Thank you so much I really appreciate it, it makes a lot more sense now!
Can you give us a raw sample string of what you're talking about? Then try not to get too technical, explain like you were talking to a non technical person, what your final outcome is. 
Hey mate, I linked to the sample html I'm trying to extract from here: https://pastebin.com/raw/kzDFBm2j In simple terms I just want to get that date as a string if CHARGED_ONBOARDING_FEE exists. Essentially I just need to know that the onboarding fee has been charged and when. 
Couple questions. Are you only ever looking for one instance of that charged string per file? And it just needs to appear somewhere in the whole file? I.e. you're only ever trying to find 1 and never multiple per string? Also, can you be positively sure it's always a &lt;td width="60px"&gt; before the dates? If it's super specific you can do something, but as soon as anything changes (i.e. they decide to do &lt;td width="65px"&gt;) things will break. There really isn't a good way to parse html for a multitude of reasons. However, if you can be sure things like that won't change you can do it. Also, where is this data coming from? Is there some sort of api or service you could consume the data from? That's generally how you do things of this nature. 
this is the trap is integer math. since your variables are integers, and your static values are integers, the result in each step of the math is also only an integer, no decimals. usually you can add a ".0" to the static values and that trigger the result to be a Double and it'll do what you expect.. so, `intF = (9.0 / 5.0) * (intC + 32)`
Your parentheses are off. intF = ((9 / 5) * intC) + 32 intC = ((5 / 9) * intF) - 32
Change your variables from int to double. Ints don't have decimals so you lose that precision. That was probably one point of this assignment, to learn that :)
I don’t think a lot of users here have direct access to a Bloomberg terminal, let alone enough opportunity to develop VBA actions to work with it. I know there’s an Excel plugin for Bloomberg terminals, so I would assume that there should be accompanying documentation for those users that might help explain what options are available with VBA to work through. That might be your best bet to start.
What you are referring to is an implicit conversion to integer values, that occurs during division, and only when the divisor is explicitly declared as an integer. Because the constant values are not actually defined, they have a variant type, and can remain decimal values after the division has occurred. This implicit conversion doesn't occur on multiplication, and so the math holds. The only thing wrong is that the parentheses are in the wrong places. Otherwise, he could use doubles for added precision, if the program is expected to return them.
Can you send me a full file of what you're trying to parse?
&gt; Because the constant values are not actually defined, they have a variant type is that new for vb.net? pretty sure they get implied to the least type in other versions, and pretty much all other languages.
Most of my vb experience is with vb6, but there, anything not explicitly typed is treated as a variant. 
Have you found a solution yet?
I have not
should work as long as your silent script tells it to not install dataaccess components
Have you tried? 
You're assigning your variables the wrong way around, the right always goes into the left a = txtGrade.Text
&gt;Whenever I run my program it automatically does the answer for d That is because all your conditions are a always true. So alle the if branches will be executed and therefore you are overwriting the lblP and lblF text 4 times and at the end D is winning because it is last. You can fix that like this: txtGrade.Text = a 'this is where i think im going wrong If a = txtGrade.Text Then lblP.Text = "20 students passed" lblF.Text = "No students failed" Exit Sub 'leave the click sub after success End If But i dont think this will solve your problem because the code you wrote does not really make sense. You are saying: Put a in txtGrade.Text Is a the same as txtGrade.Text? (Answer will always be true) Write a fixed amount of people passing in the output ... This never makes sense. I assume you are supposed to count something but i can't tell exactly with the given information 
Set a breakpoint at your product found message, press f5, when it stops at the line, use your locals window to inspect, also, 4 spaces before each Reddit line formats it as code There are 4 spaces starting this line
that is not how you use String.Format. just concatenate instead.
 MsgBox(String.Format("Product ID: {0}", reader.GetValue(0)))
I've done it slightly differently but it does work. &amp;#x200B;
Managed to fix it, thanks for the heads up too !
Perfect!! Managed to fix my problem. What does that {0} signify just for future reference ?
Select * from RentalTable where DateOfHire = Cast(GetDate() as Date)
Where date = now()
What parameters would I use the the SQL query ?
Cheers man! &lt;3
Check for the "DateOfHire" column's data type. If it's smalldatetime, you should be fine with just DateOfHire = GETDATE() otherwise you would have to CAST both sides with DATE.
What is a double? &amp;#x200B;
It seems to be the "Me.txtbxEntree1.Text = int" that screwes up the whole thing, but I can't convert F to C
similar to a decimal (which you could also use) the difference between the two is how they're stored
You could keep track of which way the calculations are going; from C2F or the other way around. You could use a variable "Celsius2Fahrenheit as boolean = true" for instance, to indicate from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Then you check to see if this is true/false whenever user clicks "Switch" or when the user clicks "Convert", and change labels accordingly. You use the same logic to decide which calculation is used as well. 
What flavor of SQL? What's the DataType of the DateOfHire column? These things are important. Case in point: /u/Fsnopi's answer won't work for SQL Server and /u/Herdnerfer's answer depends on an assumed data type.
Thank you so much! 
SOLVED! &amp;#x200B; [https://pastebin.com/vCcrVip9](https://pastebin.com/vCcrVip9)
Just use a boolean variable.. name is something like: "isCelcius".. if true then celcius to farenheit, if false, then vise vera.. 
&gt;You're coming along nicely with this assignment BTW Thank you very very much sir! &amp;#x200B;
How are you selecting/choosing the text?
&gt; 'if this is F, then we switch the c back to c and the f back to f, otherwise we do the opposite if(Me.lblCelsius.Text = "Fahreneheit") Me.lblCelsius.Text = "Celsius" Me.lblFahrenheit.Text = "Fahreneheit" Me.lblC.Text = "°F" Me.lblF.Text = "°C" else Me.lblCelsius.Text = "Fahreneheit" Me.lblFahrenheit.Text = "Celsius" Me.lblC.Text = "°F" Me.lblF.Text = "°C" end if Me.lblCelsius.Text = "Fahreneheit" Me.lblFahrenheit.Text = "Celsius" End Sub The "if else2 thing does not work. It switches the labels ones but does not switch it again
As someone who does have access to a Bloomberg terminal, just copy/paste it manually. You could set up some sort of global hot-key handler to do it but that is a lot more hassle than just doing it yourself.
Also, please use parameters if you have to manually insert the date into the SQL statement.
Instead of moving around your controls on the form when you switch, it would probably be easier to have a "input" textbox and a "output" textbox and keep track of the current "mode" of the form (the modes being "F° to C°" and "C° to F°"... When the form starts, you set the default mode and update the labels. If the user clicks on the switch button, you can toggle the mode and update the labels. When the user clicks the convert button, you always read the input temp from the "input" textbox, apply the correct formula to convert according to the mode you're in, and print the result in the output textbox. 
the general technique is "screen scraping". you submit the form and get the html, then parse it. if you use your browsers inspection tools the results seem to be very well formed html, which will help a lot. there are some html parsing libraries and I'd recommend looking into using one. I haven't used one in .net so I don't have a recommendation.
Html agility pack
You'd want to use the httpclient library to post the data in the same way you do when you type, and then html agility pack to parse the results
In general the Using statement is great for any object handling that are disposable. Both reading or writing files, streams and if you create your own object with your own IDisposable method I always recommend the Using statement. In fact I don’t get why Microsoft keep using the old fashion way on MSDN examples. It’s horrible because you are left with flushing, closing and disposing your object. Using the Using statement you leave it all to the End Using statement to shutdown the object usage. 
Yes, there is the ability to do exactly what you ask. Please do us a favor though and show us the code that isn't working so we can point you in the right direction. 
It looks like /u/Herdnerfer assumed it was smalldatetime and is stripping the time from GetDate.
Never worked for a company where they logged the time of hire down to the minute.
What's the error that you're getting? 
I think you need to use integer division to get a number of tables. Then you need to use the mod operator to find out if there is a remainder and if so then you add one table. 235 / 8 = 29 235 Mod 8 = 3 Thus you need 30 tables. You can use an If with the mod to determine if you should add one. 
after the loop runs for a while, it cuts off more than 20 chars and I get this error: https://i.imgur.com/R2QPGzR.png
Unfortunately that gives me a crash and doesn't want to work :(
Isn't it Date.Now? Can you try that? 
Nope doesn't work 
Datetime.now? I'll have to look later. I'm not at my computer to see what I use. 
It's weird cos I added a breakpoint to it and Datetime.now() is the correct today's date and today date is just 1/1/0001
DateTime.Now gives you today's date and the current time. Date.Today seems correct and works for me. Here is my LinqPad code when trying it. Dim todayDate As Date = Date.Today Date.Today.Dump() todayDate.Dump()
Doesn't seem to like dump says it's not a member of Date
Forgive for me noobness but how do I like use that for my todaydate variable?
Exactly as it is in my code... `Dim todaydate As Date =` `Date.Today` &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
todaydate just = 1/1/0001
Maybe share your entire code so we can see what's wrong? Surely, there is another reason for the problem.
This is my code Private Sub frmCarsduetocollect\_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load Dim todaydate As Date = [Date.Today](https://Date.Today) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; If DbConnect() Then Dim SQLCmd As New OleDbCommand With SQLCmd .Connection = cn .CommandText = "Select \* from Tbl\_Rental Where DateOfHire = '" &amp; todaydate.ToShortDateString &amp; "'"
Try adding the following line right after the line you declared todaydate on. MessageBox.Show(todaydate.ToShortDateString()) &amp;#x200B;
Well it says 28/10/2018 so now I definitely don't know what's wrong 
[Now.date](https://Now.date) is what you are looking for.
Ok now I have another problem When I initially added the date to the database via date time picked it added it with the time at 00:00:00 but date.today just doesn't have the time is there anyway around this can I add 00:00:00 to the date or vice versa
I would probably do it something like this. sqltext="SELECT \* FROM RENTALTABLE WHERE DATEOFHIRE='" &amp; [now.date](https://now.date) &amp; "'" &amp;#x200B;
Turn on Option Strict and Option Explicit. I think you'll find out where your issue is then. 
The best I've ever seen... [https://html-agility-pack.net/](https://html-agility-pack.net/)
Where in my code would I add that ?
Mine was just an example for you to get the idea, but in your case your code would look like. Dim todaydate As String = DateTime.Now.ToString("MM/dd/yyyy") &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Sorry mate that doesn't work either I generally don't know what to do at this point I add the DateOfHire to the database with a date time picker but this formats it a weird way with 2018-10-28 00:00:00 but when I'm dimming todaydate as date today it doesn't change it it just keeps it as 1/1/0001
Sorry where abouts would the date after conversiln go 
My date time picked is datcurrentdate and I use that to add the date the user picks into the database later on another form it will show all the records that are from today's date 
My problem is it's the wrong format 
This should be what you are asking I hope. I added the SQL statement to show how I'd use the conversion. &amp;#x200B; `Dim DateAfterConversion As String = datcurrentdate.Value.ToString("MM/dd/yyyy")` &amp;#x200B; `sqltext = "UPDATE DATABASE TABLE SET DATE='" &amp; DateAfterConversion &amp; "' WHERE USERNAME='" &amp; user &amp; "'"`
Where abouts would the dim date after conversion go? Would it be the start of the form ?
So the user would input a number and then i think the Len(BinaryString) would check the length of the string? With this length you would use the for loop mentioned to convert to denary? I dont know what step - 1 does sorry
Ok ok everything I've tried isn't working I have a friend who knows this stuff I'm meeting him tommorow I think it would be easier for him just to see the whole program with me and work out what I'm doing wrong Thanks for all your help anyway mate
Just copy and paste the part you are having trouble with, if you want more help.

Right ok i did that but i still get the no value given for one or more required parameters error here is the code for that &amp;#x200B; Private Sub frmCarsduetocollect\_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load Dim todaydate As String = DateTime.Now.ToString("MM/dd/yyyy") &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; If DbConnect() Then Dim SQLCmd As New OleDbCommand With SQLCmd .Connection = cn .CommandText = "Select \* from Tbl\_Rental Where DateOfHire = todaydate" &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Dim rs As OleDbDataReader = .ExecuteReader() &amp;#x200B; While [rs.Read](https://rs.Read) &amp;#x200B; Dim NewRow As New DataGridViewRow NewRow.CreateCells(datcarstocollect) &amp;#x200B; NewRow.Cells(2).Value = rs("CarBrand") NewRow.Cells(3).Value = rs("CarModel") &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; datcarstocollect.Rows.Add(NewRow) End While End With End If
Do the conversion again, then search by the conversion date. sqltext="SELECT \* FROM TBL\_RENTAL WHERE DATEOFHIRE='" &amp; dateAfterConversion &amp; "'" as an example. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
You need to add the parameter for todaydate. .CommandText = "Select * from Tbl_Rental Where DateOfHire =@todaydate" .Parameters.AddWithValue("@todaydate", todaydate)
Are we talking win forms or web forms here?
it was called the inputbox().
variable=inputbox("Text here")
A simple way to look at it is to consider how you proceed if I tell you I'm going to give you a number. Let's do a (normal, base 10) example: I tell you "one", so, mentally you note "1" and have the value at one. I then say "five", so mentally you have "15" and the value at fifteen. But what did you do to go from 1 to 15? You multiplied the 1 by 10 (the base) and added the value I gave you. If I then say "three", you'll update your mental number to 153 by multiplying 15 by 10 (the base) and adding three. You're probably not consciously doing the "multiply by 10 part", since you're so used to seeing low numbers that it happends automatically. You can do the same for base 2. If I say "one-zero-one-one-zero", you can take the 1, then multiply by 2 and add zero; then multiply by 2 again and add 1 and so on until you get 22, the correct decimal value for 10110. In code, it looks like this: Dim binary = "1110111011010111" Dim denary = 0UL For i = 0 To binary.Length - 1 denary = denary * 2 denary = denary + Val(binary(i)) Next Console.WriteLine(denary) ' 61143 in this case 
fix how? which is line 11? (pastes don't always match your editor) what's wrong with it? 
I think you are going to need more lines. Check this out though I think it is what you are looking for https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17329148/vba-convert-string-into-arithmetic-operator
you simple can't do it like that with compiled languages. you have program in every user input operator, parse out the input, and run different code for each operation. if you were using vbscript you could use the eval function. there's also a way to embed vbscript, but I don't know if there's a way to get the result back out.
Or easier, concert to array and reverse? Dim MyArray() as string = InputString.Tochararray() MyArray.Reverse() Dim OutPutValue = new string(myarray)
Pardon formatting, on mobile. You could also use Select Case: Select Case sign Case “/“ answer = num1 / num2 Case “*” answer = num1 * num2 Case “-“ answer = num1 - num2 Case “+” answer = num1 + num2 End Select [Microsoft VB Case Statement](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/statements/select-case-statement) For If statements, you can use If condition Then ... ElseIf condition Then ... ElseIf condition Then ... End If
CInt() uses bankers rounding, which means if the fractional part is exactly 0.5, it rounds to the nearest even integer, as in: CInt(2.5) = 2 CInt(3.5) = 4 But, that's not the issue here I don't think... If input is 876: Iteration 1 begin: Number = 876 Remainder = 876 mod 10 = 6 Sum = 0 * 10 + 6 = 6 Number = CInt(876 / 10 = 87.6) = 88 Iteration 2 begin: Number = 88 Remainer = 88 mod 10 = 8 Sum = 6 * 10 + 8 = 68 Number = CInt(88 / 10 = 8.8) = 9 Iteration 3 begin: Number = 9 Remainder = 9 mod 10 = 9 Sum = 68 * 10 + 9 = 689 Number = CInt(9 / 10 = 0.9) = 1 Iteration 4 begin: Number = 1 Remainder = 1 mod 10 = 1 Sum = 689 * 10 + 1 = 6891 Number = CInt(1 / 10 = 0.1) = 0 What you should be doing is grabbing the remainder like you are but then subtract the remainder from the number immediately and you won't be rounding at all. For instance: While Number &gt; 0 Remainder = Number Mod 10 Number = (Number - Remainder) / 10 Sum = Sum * 10 + Number End While Iteration 1 begins: Number = 876 Remainder = 876 Mod 10 = 6 Number = 876 - 6 = 870 / 10 = 87 Sum = 0 * 10 + 6 Iteration 2 begins: Number = 87 Remainder = 87 Mod 10 = 7 Number = 87 - 7 = 80 / 10 = 8 Sum = 6 * 10 = 60 + 7 = 67 Iteration 3 begins: Number = 8 Remainder = 8 Mod 10 = 8 Number = 8 - 8 = 0 / 10 = 0 Sum = 67 * 10 = 670 + 8 = 678 Number = 0 so loop ends
Dang
I've done something like this before, and you do need to use eval. I'll see if I can find the code and update later. 
On mobile so hard to read at times. But it looks like you need another \ in your file path + name combo. 
OK, below is my "Problem" class and "GameOptions" struct. Each instance of the Problem class generates and solves a random math problem based on a GameOptions object you provide to it. The GameOptions allows you to control the number of operands, allowed operators, whether negative answers are allowed, and how many digits the operands can have. The problem generator will also avoid creating a problem that divides by zero. The number of digits is capped out at 2, but can be expanded upon by adding more cases to the select statement. There are almost certainly better ways to do this. I'm a hobbyist, and this was written for free. There's also a few things in there that don't make sense outside of my project, like ProvidedAnswer and AnswerTime. They can be safely ignored, though. You'll need to include "Microsoft Script Control 1.0" into your project. The code is fairly self-explanatory. Let me know if you have any questions. GameOptions: Public Structure GameOptions Property NumberOfOperands As Integer Property AllowNegatives As Boolean Property AllowAddition As Boolean Property AllowSubtraction As Boolean Property AllowMultiplication As Boolean Property AllowDivision As Boolean Property GameTime As Integer Property NumberOfDigits As Integer End Structure Problem: Public Class Problem Property Question As String Property ProblemNumber As Integer Property CorrectAnswer As Integer Property ProvidedAnswer As Integer Property AnswerTime As Integer Property Correct As String Property Operands As New List(Of Integer) Property Operators As New List(Of String) Public Sub New(ByVal opt As GameOptions) GenerateProblem(opt) End Sub Private Sub GenerateProblem(ByVal opt As GameOptions) Dim max As Integer Dim AllowedOperators As New List(Of String) Dim PreviousOperator As String = Nothing Dim rnd As New Random Dim scr As New MSScriptControl.ScriptControl scr.Language = "VBScript" If opt.AllowAddition Then AllowedOperators.Add("+") End If If opt.AllowSubtraction Then AllowedOperators.Add("-") End If If opt.AllowDivision Then AllowedOperators.Add("/") End If If opt.AllowMultiplication Then AllowedOperators.Add("*") End If Select Case opt.NumberOfDigits Case 1 max = 9 Case 2 max = 99 End Select Dim tryAgain As Boolean = True While tryAgain = True Question = "" Operands.Clear() Operators.Clear() For i As Integer = 1 To opt.NumberOfOperands Dim operand As New Integer Dim T As Boolean = False If PreviousOperator = "/" Then operand = rnd.Next(1, max) Else operand = rnd.Next(0, max) End If If opt.AllowNegatives = True Then If rnd.Next(100) &gt; 50 Then operand = 0 - operand End If End If Operands.Add(operand) If i &lt; opt.NumberOfOperands Then Dim oprtr As String oprtr = AllowedOperators(rnd.Next(0, AllowedOperators.Count)) Operators.Add(oprtr) PreviousOperator = oprtr End If Next For i As Integer = 0 To Operands.Count - 1 Dim strng As String If Operands(i) &lt; 0 Then strng = "(" &amp; Operands(i) &amp; ")" Else strng = Operands(i) End If If i &lt; Operands.Count - 1 Then strng = strng &amp; " " &amp; Operators(i) End If Question = Question &amp; " " &amp; strng Next CorrectAnswer = scr.Eval(Question) If opt.AllowNegatives = False And CorrectAnswer &lt; 0 Then tryAgain = True Else : tryAgain = False End If End While End Sub End Class
on the datagrid click event, you will need to write code in the click event to figure out what was clicked.
But I works with converting c to f. Are you saying it should be like this intF = (intC + 32.0 \* 9.0 / 5.0), inC = (intF - 32.0 \* 9,0 / 5.0)
&gt;I changed it to (intF-32.0) \* 5.0 / 9.0, and the it says the answer is to 1°F equals - . &amp;#x200B;
&gt; But I works with converting c to f. because your IntF is fine the way it is. IntC is the one you need to change, similar to what you're replying here, but check your parentheses. No offense, but looking at your reply where you're thinking about changing _both_, I think you need to take a refresher course on algebra.... 
I figured it out! The problem is that after the minus(-) you can see the right numbers but there is too many numbers after the decimal to display. How do I limit the numbers after the decimal? 
format()
I dont' know from memory, check the docs.
AndAlso should prevent that error as it should only try to cast when IsNumeric is true
Unfortunately one of the requirements is to have the loop break after the user enters X. So I would need to be able to keep incrementing sales entered until X is entered. I would much rather not use a loop as it would be easier to code.
this code doesn't really do what you describe at all. you don't have any inputs inside your loop. InputBox is blocking, it halts the code until it is closed. if you're only entering one number then they don't need to type X. if you want multiple numbers entered, you need to have the input box in a loop and then entering X is when you exit the loop.
Ah, don't know that operator. I'm primarily VBA so it seems that OP has a few unfamiliar elements in there. Something is odd though; if strSales is "12x" then isNumeric should fail and not call the CInt. The error *Conversion from string "x" to type 'Integer' is not valid.* suggests that isNumeric is returning true, passing the invalid string to CInt. From experience, I'd say an IF statement without any = defaults to = TRUE, could it for whatever reason be passing even with an = FALSE response?
I doubt you should be using the InputBox for this task since there is no way to determine when the user hits "X". Dim s as string = InputBox(....) That line stops all execution until the user hits enter, escape or pushed the submit button of the Input box. If you were writing a console app you could do something like: DO s=Console.Read if s='x' then exit DO if IsNumeric(s) then MyNumberString +=s LOOP If you have to use the InputBox you could change your code to do this, but I don't see how that makes sense: If IsNumeric(strSales.ToLower.Replace("x", "")) AndAlso CInt(strSales.ToLower.Replace("x", "")) &gt; 0 Then That would avoid the error you are getting now. Of course if the user doesn't enter an X you are in an endless loop.
makes me wonder if this is even the real code or a re-typed abstraction.
Then you don't want to be using an inputbox; you want to be using a textbox and running your code in the box's change event. You still don't need a loop; you're only ever interested in the rightmost character; look into strings.right() for a non-loopy way to do that.
InputBox is another requirement as well. I would've much rather have done this via TextBox.
It is very roundabout and overly complicated project with InputBox and breaking a loop when user enters X into the InputBox requirements.
If that's true, your assignment is extremely arbitrary and overcomplicated. Pseudo-pseudocode: Inputbox to grab the user's input (inputbox) Loop through input checking each is a number or X. Throw an error if it's not. (string LIKE command) Take the string up to and not including the X. CInt it. (strings.left) Do whatever else you need to do. Wonder WTF whoever came up with this assignment is trying to accomplish, when this can be achieved far more efficiently and easily.
I've been asking myself that same question in regards to how overcomplicated this all is.
This is a re-typed abstraction from the project requirements. It just feels like an overly complicated way of doing things.
Nope. Certain form elements do however have events which trigger when something happens; a textbox when the contents are changed and radio buttons &amp; checkboxes when they're ticked etc.
there are multiple events you can use on the text box, or the button next to it. the easiest is just to sue the click event on the button.
I grabbed the code from the handout and threw it into Visual Basic, just to see what if anything it would do. It's possible that I may not have added all the right variables as this was just a quick and dirty test. I'm still looking at a few other resources in regards to loops.
you'd need to keep it in a variable or something. maybe instead of storing the minimum value in `min` store the `i` value, then use that to get the cell and the value out of it. you could also skip the `a` array completely and just use the cells for storage directly.
Just put the code to check the number in the click event of the button. It's that simple. 
It has to do X rounds, maybe i'm overcomplicating things but it has to do it for X rounds and then stop
sorry, the game has to have X rounds, as an example i let the user have 10 rounds, the game needs to repeat the cycle of generate number, get users numbers and tell who won the round.
Sorry will edit
My pleasure!
So I have no idea what you're doing overall and we should probably have that information first. This requests doesn't make much sense as is. That said, if you want to convert a list to a string, you generally use the [String.Join](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string.join?view=netframework-4.7.2#System_String_Join_System_String_System_Collections_Generic_IEnumerable_System_String__) method. &amp;#x200B;
I actually did that, not that detailed but a "in a nutshell" version lets say
Here's a hint: "&gt;=" means "greater than or equal to".
Here is another hint: decHourlyWage is a number, txtHourlyWage.Text is a string; Some conversion may need to be done if you want to do maths with it
I fixed it, It was a mix up in the variables, but thanks anyways &amp;#x200B;
Well done! 👍
Boolean is a logic variable that has a value or either true or false. 
Are you able to post the code on somewhere like GitHub?
I've taken this inspiration and built my own [temperature converter for the web](https://www.richie-bendall.ml/temperature-converter/). Side note: this is **not** an advertisement.
The Column Name must be misspelled. "-1" index value means it's not found in the collection.
I wonder if MouseCaptureChanged is firing on the MouseDown event, so the Move and Leave events stop firing. I guess we'd need to know what type of object you are actually creating.
Do you mean the control type? the only thing is the main Form and on the foreground , each tile is a Label 
I created a demo that keeps reporting MOUSE MOVE events after a MOUSE DOWN. It does this by setting the CAPTURE property of the 'selected' Label to True in the MouseDown event. I have no idea how this works, but here it is: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Public Class frmMain Dim bCaptureMode As Boolean Dim sCaptured As String = "" Private Sub frmMain_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Me.Load Me.Top = 200 Me.Left = 20 lblStatus.Text = "" End Sub Sub Label_MouseDown(sender As Object, e As MouseEventArgs) Handles L1.MouseDown, L2.MouseDown, L3.MouseDown, L4.MouseDown, L5.MouseDown, L6.MouseDown, L7.MouseDown, L8.MouseDown, L9.MouseDown Dim control As Control = sender control.Capture = True bCaptureMode = True sCaptured = "" CaptureLocChange(e.Location) End Sub Sub Label_MouseUp(sender As Object, e As MouseEventArgs) Handles L1.MouseUp, L2.MouseUp, L3.MouseUp, L4.MouseUp, L5.MouseUp, L6.MouseUp, L7.MouseUp, L8.MouseUp, L9.MouseUp bCaptureMode = False CaptureLocChange(e.Location) End Sub Sub Label_MouseMove(sender As Object, e As MouseEventArgs) Handles L1.MouseMove, L2.MouseMove, L3.MouseMove, L4.MouseMove, L5.MouseMove, L6.MouseMove, L7.MouseMove, L8.MouseMove, L9.MouseMove CaptureLocChange(e.Location) End Sub Sub CaptureLocChange(ByVal MouseLoc As Point) If bCaptureMode Then ' Call function to resolve Mouse X,Y coords to a 'tile' and register it as selected. End If lblStatus.Text = MouseLoc.ToString() &amp; " Capturing: " &amp; bCaptureMode End Sub End Class --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Same here.
For something like this I would be looking at manipulating image metadata which should already have a keywords field: [https://photometadata.org/META-Resources-Field-Guide-to-Metadata](https://photometadata.org/META-Resources-Field-Guide-to-Metadata) &amp;#x200B; [https://kellyschronicles.wordpress.com/2011/09/01/get-or-write-image-metadata-with-vb-net/](https://kellyschronicles.wordpress.com/2011/09/01/get-or-write-image-metadata-with-vb-net/)
