WOW So I just tried messing with the space and I get this. http://imgur.com/tQi35V5 New Source Code: 'triangle 3 For n = 26 To 1 Step -1 For blank = 26 - n To 1 Step -1 TextBox2.Text = TextBox2.Text &amp; " " Next For i = 1 To n TextBox2.Text = TextBox2.Text &amp; "m" Next TextBox2.Text = TextBox2.Text &amp; vbNewLine Next TextBox2.Text = TextBox2.Text &amp; vbNewLine 'triangle 4 For n = 26 To 1 Step -1 For blank = n - 1 To 1 Step -1 TextBox2.Text = TextBox2.Text &amp; " " Next For i = 26 - n + 1 To 1 Step -1 TextBox2.Text = TextBox2.Text &amp; "m" Next TextBox2.Text = TextBox2.Text &amp; vbNewLine That is almost it! Your comment has helped me immensely. Thank you! I just somehow need to get it aligned.... Edit: On second thought...I just realized the blank space should be 25 spaces or 25 " "'s...but at least it looks a lot closer. Second Edit: ... It worked. I went with the monospaced font and it came out great! The project did not specify font. http://imgur.com/DNVgk5s Thank you again!

The controls collection might not be safe to modify while it is being enumerated, as is common for many collections. Try gathering the pictureboxes to be removed in a separate list first and then remove them in a second step.
 Dim ctrl As Control Dim byebye As ControlCollection For Each ctrl In Me.Controls ' loop through the controls on the form If (ctrl.GetType() Is GetType(PictureBox)) Then 'check its a picturebox If ctrl.Name = "pFavourite1" Or ctrl.Name = "pFavourite2" Or ctrl.Name = "pFavourite3" Or ctrl.Name = "pFavourite4" Or ctrl.Name = "pFavourite5" Then ' Leave these ones Else 'Me.Controls.Remove(ctrl) byebye.Add(ctrl) End If End If Next ctrl = Nothing For Each ctrl In byebye Me.Controls.Remove(ctrl) Next I'm getting an error because byebye=Null at runtime - I'll be honest I haven't worked with Control collections before so I'm fumbling in the dark a little here.
Well, it's null because you haven't assigned it a value. But `ControlCollection` isn't supposed to be created from user code anyway, just use a normal `New List(Of Control)`.
&gt; New List(Of Control) Worked flawlessly when I replaced As ControlCollection with that. Thank you!
^ What tweq said. This worked for me: ' ADDED SOME PBs TO SCREEN Private Sub BuildPBs() For i = 0 To 19 Dim pb As New PictureBox pb.Name = "pFavourite" &amp; i pb.Location = New Point(i * 20, i * 20) pb.Size = New Size(50, 50) pb.BorderStyle = BorderStyle.FixedSingle pb.Show() Me.Controls.Add(pb) Next End Sub Private Sub Form1_Shown(sender As Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Shown BuildPBs() End Sub ' DESTROYED UNWANTED PBs WITH BUTTON Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click ' BUILD FAVOURITES LIST Dim lstFavorites As New List(Of String) lstFavorites.AddRange({"pFavourite1", "pFavourite2", "pFavourite3"}) ' BUILD LIST OF PBs ON FORM Dim lstControls As New List(Of Control) For Each c As Control In Me.Controls If c.GetType() = GetType(PictureBox) Then lstControls.Add(c) Next ' REMOVE UNWANTED ITEMS FROM FORM lstControls.ForEach(Sub(c) If Not lstFavorites.Contains(c.Name) Then Me.Controls.Remove(c)) End Sub 
Every time you remove an item from the controls collection, the control collection is rebuilt, and if it is stored in an array structure internally, every item is shifted over. The For Each loop is syntactical sugar for a standard For I=1 to N loop. So, you should first go through the collection of controls and identify the controls for deletion later. Create a variable that is a second List of Controls ( call it L2Delete), go through the control list and when the control passes the filter, then add it to the L2Delete List. Then, once you have made that pass, loop through the items in the list use them as the parameter in the Controls.remove(ctrl as Control) method. You could use Linq to make the logic more explicit. 'First make a function to factor out that ugly IF statement 'assume this is somewhere else in the code function MyFilterTestFunction(ctrl as Control) as Boolean . . . if (ctrl.gettype . . . . . . return . . . ' true or false end function ' 'use that function here Dim L4Delete as List(Control ) ' I forget the exact syntax, I don't use VB.net enough L4Delete = From c in me.controls Where MyFilterTestFunction(c) Select c ' now the L4Delete contains all the controls we want to delete. We follow this with For each c in L4Delete me.controls.remove(c) next I hope this compiles, I haven't used the Linq syntax in a while. If the Linq confuses you, It is also possible that you could have used two FOR EACH loops. 
I'm wanting to automate it, to give that extra bang when I show the proposed solution to my management. Sorry I didn't specify.
Looks like it'll work perfectly, thank you! I'll try it out tomorrow and let you know.
In each reference, `Cells(Counter, 1).Value` is formatted as such: `Cells(RowNumber,ColumnNumber).Value` Adjusting ColumnNumber to meet your needs.
Found it! It's the Cells(Counter, 1). I have to admit, I'm impressed by how powerful visual basic actually is. I'll always be a bash kid but this at least makes Windows usable.
Is it a predetermined column, or one that would be easier if it's picked by the user?
It's predetermined, in this particular case it's actually column 4.
Ah, in that case, I'd use this subroutine alongside the other one: Private Sub FillEmptyCells() Dim Counter As Long For Counter = 2 To GetLastRow If Len(Cells(Counter, 4).Value) = 0 Then: Cells(Counter, 4).Value = "" Next Counter End Sub Since you already have the `GetLastRow()` in your code, this subroutine will automatically use it. And of course, you can fill in `""` with whatever text you want to insert into the cell.
&gt; Private Sub FillEmptyCells() Dim Counter As Long For Counter = 2 To GetLastRow If Len(Cells(Counter, 4).Value) = 0 Then: Cells(Counter, 4).Value = "" Next Counter End Sub Absolutely perfect, thank you so much!
I was trying to get the txt file to read but i keep getting an error when i run it. Any suggestions will be great
An unhandled exception of type 'System.IO.FileNotFoundException' occurred in mscorlib.dll Additional information: Could not find file 'C:\Users\Jeff Sullivan\Desktop\Visual Studios\261SullivanProj6\proj6\Proj6\bin\Debug\race.txt'.
How much clearer could that error message possibly be?
I would suggest reading about Visual Studio and relative vs. absolute file paths.
Yes, upon reflection, beginner, not intermediate. Sorry for the mistake there. I think sometimes, if we've be exposed to enough, we can sometimes forget what it's like to start at the beginning, when everything was seemingly super advanced. I'm pretty new myself by comparison to a lot of programmers. I thought if i mentioned intermediate it might help with confidence. The lack of scope in technologies is definitely a shortfall also. One positive is that VBA for Excel is one of the other topics in the same learning format on that site. Thanks again :) 
&gt;Homework questions are tolerated, please be specific about the question as much a possible. Asking us to write it for you is not going to happen. We also reserve the right to not answer if we think you are just not trying.
um, ok im not asking somebody to write my program for me, im just look for help finding the solution, no matter what i have looked up i cant find a solution. Sorry if it feels like im asking somebody to write my code buts it simply not true.
Your post has been locked because you did not provide any of your own code but only posted a screenshot of your _homework question_.
Sorry, but your statement of what is the issue is hard to understand. So I will address what I can 1) I do not see the "Randomize" function, so I cannot tell what you are trying to do there. If you are trying to have random values in your array then take a look into the Random object. It will allow you to create a random value instead of 0 to 99. 2) When you remove a value within an array, all the other values move into the empty position eg: Array: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Remove value "1", then the array will be; 0, 2, 3, 4 3) It might help you if you work with smaller pieces at a time. Create a function, test it, debug it, fix it. Once it works move on to the next function/feature Hope this helps a little
There is an issue with the Randomize object, not your issue, and issue with MS's object (to insure you don't think it's a problem you have) Create the Random object at Form Level. Where you are declaring these: Dim iNum, iNum2, iIndex As Integer Dim bfound As Boolean Dim iExtra As Integer = 0 Also make sure to seed your Random object Dim objRandom as Random(10) As for the second point, show me the function with the issue and I can help more specific. 
Your SearchArray function searches the array of integers, but the DeleteItem function deletes from the listbox. After the first delete the 2 lists will be out of sync. You either need to delete from both places, or just delete from the array, then clear &amp; refill the listbox with the remaining values.
Among many other problems in that code, you cannot remove an item from an array directly. If you absolutely must use an array, you must create a new smaller array and copy the old elements to the new one. Ideally, use a list instead. Lists let you ".RemoveAt()" to remove the element at a given position.
How would I be able to clear and refill the listbox with the remaining values? That seems like my best option for where I am at.

His solution checks for a candidate number3, if there is any number less than number3 - in this case the loop with number2 - that divides number3 without residue: If number3 mod number2 = 0 Then If there was such number, the candidate is not prime. However, cringeworthy and inefficient implementation!
Actually, I found a better solution: http://imgur.com/a/Ojo8g If you have time, can you explain all of it step by step for me, please?
GoTo x jumps to the marker 'x:' in your code. str is just an arbitrary string variable, I just wanted to say that the Console.WriteLine(str) can be replaced by Labelxxx.Text &amp;= str
Well, I already did and don't know how to do this in more detail "We have the outer loop with increment of i up to a. This i will be the current candidate we want to check for primality. Now, we have the inner loop with variable j. It goes up the i - 1 and checks, whether the current j is a divisor of i"
Do you want all the primes (eg 2, 3, 5, 7) or do you just want the number of primes (eg 4)?
As a further optimization, you can make the code much faster by replacing For j = 2 to i - 1 with For j = 2 to Math.Sqrt(i) 
Of course, didn't really think too much making the code.
The fastest methodology for calculating prime numbers is called the Sieve of Atkin. https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sieve_of_Atkin Here is an implementation I whipped up. Dim totalCount As Integer = 0 Dim isPrime As New BitArray(topCandidate + 1) Dim squareRoot As Integer = CInt(Math.Sqrt(topCandidate)) Dim xSquare As Integer = 1, xStepsize As Integer = 3 Dim ySquare As Integer = 1, yStepsize As Integer = 3 Dim computedVal As Integer = 0 For x As Integer = 1 To squareRoot ySquare = 1 yStepsize = 3 For y As Integer = 1 To squareRoot computedVal = (xSquare &lt;&lt; 2) + ySquare If (computedVal &lt;= topCandidate) AndAlso (computedVal Mod 12 = 1 OrElse computedVal Mod 12 = 5) Then isPrime(computedVal) = Not isPrime(computedVal) End If computedVal -= xSquare If (computedVal &lt;= topCandidate) AndAlso (computedVal Mod 12 = 7) Then isPrime(computedVal) = Not isPrime(computedVal) End If If x &gt; y Then computedVal -= ySquare &lt;&lt; 1 If (computedVal &lt;= topCandidate) AndAlso (computedVal Mod 12 = 11) Then isPrime(computedVal) = Not isPrime(computedVal) End If End If ySquare += yStepsize yStepsize += 2 Next xSquare += xStepsize xStepsize += 2 Next For n As Integer = 5 To squareRoot If isPrime(n) = True Then Dim k As Integer = n * n Dim z As Integer = k While z &lt;= topCandidate isPrime(z) = False z += k End While End If Next For i As Integer = 1 To topCandidate - 1 If isPrime(i) Then totalCount += 1 End If Next Return (totalCount + 2) ' 2 and 3 will be missed in Sieve Of Atkins 
Thank you. So simple. I replaced all spaces with % in the search string. Works as it should. 
What about adding a % after 64? If the data is properly formatted it would be pointless or possibly cause new problems but the first thing that comes to mind is: "Mario 64 "
 /u/ViperSRT3g gives a good response, but the answer is kinda missing from your question about LIKE The issue LIKE and the % only show another anything else before and after the percent sign. The LIKE command doesn't look for any instance of the words within the search, which would be great. So if you want to look for any instance of all the words you're going to need a different approach. Sorry I don't have an answer for this, yet. I'll have to think about it
I think the assignment is meant to teach you how to query a database. That is not what you are doing :) You use a more classic approach by counting the rows in a loop. Also you do your avg calculation every round of the loop again, which is unnecessary. [Here](https://aspguy.wordpress.com/2008/06/08/datatablecompute-method-is-lovely/) you have a good start how to use the datatable.compute method for a better approach in letting the database engine handle the counting and averaging of values. 
You may be looking for the [Count\(\)](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_func_count.asp) function for your query.
I have added the line SrchStr = TextBox1.Lines(i).ToString() Dim nSrchStr As String = Replace(SrchStr, " ", "%") So that should eliminate any spaces in the query
Thank you for the response though I'm not sure I would want to search for any instance of all words. "Mario" and "64" could yield a ton of results alone as there are many many games that have both those words within the title. But for the sake of discussion would detecting each space, isolating each word and putting each word in to an array, then looping through the database accomplish that?
Did VB6 really have a implementation of List(of T)? How could this escape me for so long. Anyway i dont know if this is your problem but i know a similar behaviour if you reuse your tempLabel and just fill it with new informations. Did you use templabel = new Label somewhere else? I mean it somewhat like this For i = 0 to x templabel = new label '&lt;- Important line templabel.Name = "something" Masterlabel.labelset.add(templabel) next i guess the list implementation uses the memory location of the label as index, so if you do not redim your label you always overwrite the same index in the list. But as i said this is just a guess. 
&gt; Did VB6 really have a implementation of List(of T)? it doesn't.

Yes that would be one solution to your issue. Nicely thought out. There are many ways to solve a problem, and the "best" solution depends on a number of factors; ie: The time it takes to get a result (Imagine Google taking 60 second to come back with an answer) or which values returned at the "correct" ones, as some values will be correct with all key words, some with only one. So learning to know what the actual requirements of a function is a big part of being a developer. Simply saying; "Yes I can create a search" will ABSOLUTELY miss some of the issues the customer wants. In your case you could have a multiple UNION query, the first one includes just the exact phrase, and each other part of the union would be a portion of the phrase.
 Dim FindThisString As String = "P@ssword" Or "pa$$word" Or "passwOrd" That doesn't work, at all. You cannot combine strings like this. Nonsense like this is why not using [Option Strict](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zcd4xwzs.aspx) is a terrible idea.
Thank you for the link. It's exactly what I'm looking for!
Are you sure you're creating a **new** `Label` instance for every label you add?
Wow really? So its referencing the actual instance I stored (Aka tempLabel) rather than just the information in it? Is there a way to reference just the information in the label rather than the label itself? How would I transfer variables from one reference type to another?
So by having it in the loop rather than outside of the loop it will create a new instance each time and be stored again? What will happen to the old instance which will no longer be there? Why are Structures more difficult? What should I watch out for? Thank you so much for the help! I have already made significant progress this morning thanks to this information!
May i ask if you use WPF oder WinForms or ... ? But if i understand you right you are trying to develop a game in vb.net. Unfortunatly i would not recommend you doing anything game graphic related like that. I remember doing that some years ago. That is not what WinForms or WPF is made for. It is way to slow for a game. If you would like to make something like this i think you should look into [DirectX](https://www.codeproject.com/articles/159586/starting-directx-with-visual-basic-net) or OpenGL. In the long run you will be thankful. But still, it does depend on your project.
No problem. Was just wondering if you didn't understand it that way or if you missed it. Let me try to explain what i think happens. You intialize a label like this: dim lbl as new Label The new tells the compiler this is a new object for which it reserves memory. This memory is usually referenced by an address. Let us say the adress for this lbl is 1234. If you now do the following MasterLabel.LabelSet.Add(lbl) the list does not copy the lbl and instead just rembers that you want the label at position 1234 in the memory. To get a new label to add to the list you have to do the lbl = new Label to tell the compiler that you are now interested in a new instance of the objecttype label, which therefore gets a new location in memory. Alternatively you could do a "Dim lbl2 as new Label" and use this one but this would be considered bad code. 
Yes. Variables declared within a loop only remain in memory for the current iteration, after which they're discarded... unless you maintain a reference to them somewhere else, like in a list that exists outside of the loop.
I've seen something like this a few times over the years when VS encounters some error (like a broken reference) and the background compiler no longer recognizes the strings as strings, but thinks that they are boolean values. Usually in these situations you end up with hundreds of errors in VS while the error is in place, then they all correct themselves once it's fixed. I also seem to remember that VS 2010 and prior would run out of memory, and all kinds of weird stuff would happen, including the "hundreds of errors" issue. If you are doing this check repeatedly, I'd probably move the "true" values to a constant, or write a small function to do the check so that you only have to manage it in one place. 
I was just gonna do it using forms. It was just gonna be a 2D RPG, but you're probably right. I'll look into those other programs and see if I can get a grasp on the languages used - the fact that I already know how to code in VB though is mostly why I'm sticking with it. EDIT: Oh, you can use VB in engines other than Visual Basic. I guess I'll give it a try then. 
Ok that makes sense, but if that reference has the same name as the one that was stored why doesn't it get confused by that?
Because the computer isn't really storing it in as whatever you name your variable as, but instead as a register in memory somewhere. The variable name is inconsequential. Speaking of which, you can't actually refer to the object in your list by variable names. You'll have to find some way to locate your object by writing a search function, using the list index or something else.
hi guys, not sure about the forum rules so please let me know if this is out of place. this question made me curious about something. can custom characters or fonts be created and used in text boxes or labels?
That is one of the nice little things the compiler does for you. He knows that you don't want to overwrite the other Label. Even better, the so called garbage collector is a clever algorithm which recognizes when the variable is no longer of use and cleans up the memory automatically. That is the reason you don't have to do lbl = nothing If you would forget that in C you would create a memory leak in which the application blocks memory which it is not using anymore. Given enough time and label creations every pc would run out of memory. And let me add that i simplified a little here.
Well the thing with forms is that they don't use double buffering per default which makes a lot of things flickery to the human eyes. You can enable that but i remember creating a 2D top down traffic jam simulator with pure forms and constantly running into issues and problems. Its just not worth the hassle. Invest your time in OpenGL or DirectX and you will improve and can make better games :) i tried Unity a while ago and made a minecraft clone. Afaik you can use only C# for that but its basically the same as VB with a different syntax and there a pretty good online converters between the languages like the one from [telerik](http://converter.telerik.com/)
Yeah, come to think of it, some way of adding the stat icons and what not as characters would be handy.
 Message = "Total" &amp; ControlChars.Tab for column = 1 to 5 Step 1 gtot = 0 for row = 0 to 2 step 1 qtot += salesbox(row, collumn) next row Message += FormatCurrency(qtot) &amp; ControlChars.Tab next column ListBox1.Items.Add(Message) -- between your last next and end sub
Yes. I'm working on it right now. I'm just trying to minimize redundant recursion. 
Here's what I have so far: Dim grid(99) as Boolean ' ... other code here Private Function emptySquares(ind As Integer) As Integer ' return number of empty neighbors adjacent to ind Dim marked(99) as Boolean Dim adjacentEmptySquares As Integer ' return 0 if square is not empty If grid(ind) Then Return 0 ' initialize marked array For i = 0 to 99 marked(i) = False Next 'mark ind marked(ind) = True Do 'mark all empty squares adjacent to marked squares 'count empty squares adjacent to marked squares Loop Until adjacentEmptySquares = 0 ' count marked squares in array End Function
looks like you expecting them to enter 1, 2, 3. you use the number they enter as your array subscript. not very elegant. if they enter an actual year you will then have to determine if you have a row for that year and use that subscript for your data entry. if not then next available row... 
No. It needs to check if the empty box is part of the empty group that the original index is in. See the original post and the mock-up. 
Are you trying to count all empty neighbours in a group, where a group is defined by a border of filled squares? That's more involved, but still doable. Starting from the square - referenced using the x y coordinates - keep searching outwards until you hit a filled square. Your "outwards" algorithm should be something like: - search upwards until you hit filled, adding all found upwards squares to a list - going through the list, search left and right of each square in the list until you hit filled - repeat steps 1 and 2, but going downwards this time instead
Try not to write code that checks GUI elements for game logic. By that I mean you should have an internally coherent "engine" that spits out results, and the only thing your GUI should do is display output and accept input. Therefore, what's the internal logic of your snap game? Try to create that using nothing more than value variables (string, integer, booleans) and collections (list, array, queue, stack, dictionary). Once that's done, it should be relatively simple to write the hooks to display everything. 
Oh, hmm, true. Might have to use some variant of A* then, using an open and closed list whilst iteratively searching through adjacent squares. 
I wrote this up quickly, making assumptions and not really testing. However I think this might be the sort of thing you are after. Like PostalElf said, don't use the GUI to hold game logic. Decouple the logic and set the Imagebox to only display a given image. The logic behind should be contained on it's own without know what is happening to that image. '// List of all the bird images Private ReadOnly _birdPics As New List(Of ImageType) '// The currently displayed image ID Private ActiveImageID As Integer '// private counter for new ID, DONT call this, call ImageCounter() Private _imageCounter As Integer = 0 '// Score variable Private CurrentPoints As Integer = 0 '// Counter Private ReadOnly Property ImageCounter() As Integer Get _imageCounter += 1 Return _imageCounter End Get End Property '// Random generator for displaying a random image from the list Private Random As New Random() '// Load all your bird images into the Bird Pics, this should be called before the game starts Public Sub LoadImages() '// Add to list in one line _birdPics.Add(New ImageType With {.ID = ImageCounter, .Image = Image_1}) '// Add to list, broken down for easier reading Dim img As New ImageType With img .ID = ImageCounter .Image = Image_2 End With _birdPics.Add(img) End Sub '// Randomly display an image from the bird picture list.

Apologies if the code is extremely messy. It was formatted horribly to start with.
Yes, this is possible. I would use OpenXML to open and add text to a document. Here is some documentation from microsoft: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff478255.aspx Let me know if you have questions.
uytinviet dot com is not a site to be fucked with apparently. Ransomware.
But the trouble that i am having is that there are no set values in the array its all randomly generated numbers that are assigned to the array.
The program runs without any errors. The file it creates it corrupt, I can't open it to see f/what it's writing
SendKeys is disabled when a computer is locked for security purposes. You would need to utilize a custom windows credential provider. 
a text box content is a single string, and a "line" is a concept noted by your end of line marker, which often is CR character, LF character, or both characters. it's up to you parse that out and replace it. 
You're gonna need 2 loops, this really shouldn't cost that much since the values are so small: For i As Integer = 0 To 4 For j As Integer = 0 To 2 TextBox2.Text &amp;= "$" &amp; Rate(i, j).ToString("n2") &amp; " " Next TextBox2.Text &amp;= Rate(i, 3) &amp; vbnewline Next
Hmm. Ok I will try this out! Edit: Wow that worked Great!! Thank you very much. I think I am getting confused with how the variables are interpreted early on vs. variables in the loop and am slowly grasping that you just need an a...b..c...etc. to use in the loop. Thank you for the help. For i As Integer = 0 To 4 For j As Integer = 0 To 2 TextBox2.Text &amp;= "$" &amp; Rate(i, j).ToString("n2") &amp; " " Next TextBox2.Text &amp;= "$" &amp; Rate(i, 3).ToString("n2") &amp; vbNewLine Next I even tweaked your code that you gave me so that some of the symbols matched up and the decimals were corrected. At least I can do that... Thanks again! 
Yeah I tried this here. But for some reason, the values didn't add up to the right amount (I know the amount I need for certain brackets of tax rates ect) I was about 11$ dollars over the 109.50$ I was supposed to hit for a 550$ gross pay. I fixed the problem but then it comes to the next one, I can't remove the 50 dollars out of the tax to calculate the first 450$ if the value is over 500$ ? (first 50 dollars is tax free) If tax &lt;= 50 Then tax = 0 ElseIf tax &gt;= 50 And tax &lt;= 500 And rdosingle.Checked = True Then tax = ((tax - 50) * 0.21) ElseIf tax &gt;= 500 And tax &lt;= 1000 And rdosingle.Checked = True Then tax = ((tax - 50) * 0.21) + ((tax - 500) * 0.3) ElseIf tax &gt;= 1000 And tax &lt;= 2500 And rdosingle.Checked = True Then tax = ((tax - 50) * 0.21) + ((tax - 500) * 0.3) + ((tax - 1000) * 0.36) ElseIf tax &gt;= 2500 And rdosingle.Checked = True Then tax = ((tax - 50) * 0.21) + ((tax - 500) * 0.3) + ((tax - 1000) * 0.36) + ((tax - 2500) * 0.396) End If 
Good job getting it figured out. One thing I would correct is the less than and greater than equals. If something equals 50 or 500 or etc, they're technically in two sections. It will allow you cleanup some code.
Got an example of what you mean? 
So ElseIf wageamount &gt; 50 And wageamount &lt;= 500 And rdosingle.Checked = True Then
Exactly. You would have your program doing 2 calculations if something equals 50, 500, etc the other way. It's just cleanup that your professor may also be looking for.

Why not use the [Replace\(\)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bt3szac5\(v=vs.90\).aspx) function? You could load up the replacement list from your text file into an array, and loop through the array to replace each term with its corresponding word. I'd delimit each line/pair of words so that when you store them in an array, you can subsequently split that corresponding line into both pieces for your replace x with y relationship. I'd also store the raw string of text in a StringBuilder object that way you can perform your replaces on that object before outputting the end result.
Thank you, really helped me there 
what version of word? I did notice your extension for the template is .dot but the document is .docx. .dot is the old word template extension. maybe try updating to .dotx?
Updated what I have in the post, kinda making progress.
The command for replace can be found at https://www.dotnetperls.com/replace-vbnet As far as coding goes, you don't need much besides the loop and the replace command.
My pseudo code I was given to create the program was based off : Turn sentence into array loop through each word split each word into array variable translate sentence through each individual word look up each word for replacement If word is found, replace else do nothing Input words into textese sentence individually Return textese sentence as whole 
sure you can use system, system.io and system.text as described in https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms143368(v=vs.110).aspx to read your text file.
and the issue is....
I'm trying to get it to where I can calculate separately but it won't allow that when I have both running
Thanks for the help, would you mind helping with the others as well? If not, that's okay too. 
If the string the user enters in the txtNumber1 text box is a number. Then set IntUserInput(0) to the number they entered. I want this: txtNumber1 = IntUserInput(0) txtNumber2 = IntUserInput(1) txtNumber3 = IntUserInput(2) etc.. I need to take 6 numbers that the users gives me. assign it to my array and then check and see if the numbers in the array are between a certain range.
You're awesome! Thank you so much

Sorry, I'm not familiar with what you're saying. Do you mind clarifying how to .invalidate the form?
I don't have VS running at the moment, but you should be able to call "me.invalidate" on the form. That will cause it to redraw the entire form from scratch.

Your last line **Listbox1.items.add(states)** is adding the entire array object *states* to the Listbox as a single listbox item. 
Because of your last ListBox1.Items.Add(states) call, obviously? Since you refer to your lastly added item? The reason behind this: You are trying to add an item to your listbox: "states" The Items.Add() method calls the default ToString() method for the array, which is your "string[] array" 
thanks!
Thank you, sorry I'm very new and struggling. For some reason i was thinking that you are required to have a statement in "Next".

You would save the label's text, x and y positions on the form, and other attributes if there are anything else, to the text file. When the form starts up, it would first check for this file, if it finds it, then it'll read the data, and recreate the label according to what was stored in the text file. These are all the first steps to saving user configuration settings in applications.
That I know. I just don't know how to make it reading the label attributes and recreate the label.
Here's an example: Control Type | Control Name | X | Y | Autosize | Width | Height | Text ------------|------------|-|-|--------|-----|------|---- LABEL | Label1 | 12 | 9 | TRUE | 39 | 13 | Label1 When you read these from the file, you'd apply the same values to the newly generated label to recreate it. You can add all the properties of the control object if you wanted to remain as faithful to the original if you wanted to track all of that.
So far so good. But I'm having trouble at the reading part. I used IO.StreamWriter to write my .txt file. It looks like this: Label,test,695,115 (Control Type, Control Text, Control X, Control Y) Now the reading part... Im not understanding what Im supost to do. How do I tell that ReadObject() is related to that text file? Im confused :/
So I made a MsgBox just to see if it was working: MsgBox("Control Type: " + ReadObject(0) + " Control Text: " + ReadObject(1) + " Control X: " + ReadObject(2) + " Control Y: " + ReadObject(3)) Result: Index was outside the bounds of the array. Guess no luck today

From a GDI drawing persepective, if all you need to draw are lines and circles you can do this with graphics.drawline and graphics.drawellipse. There are lots of examples around the web for this. http://www.dotnetheaven.com/article/drawing-lines-in-gdi-using-vb.net For some things though, you can get away with just using standard controls. It is easy to make a line or rectangle from a label control with a border. or making a label solid black and then making it thin and long to be a line.

Shit, what should I do to fix this?
You should use a more complete sound library like naudio or directsound for this.
Thanks man I got it working now. I used functions like you said, thanks for the help.
Have you seen `Function` in class? It basically let's you encapsulate your formulas in a reusable block of code that will return a result to you. For example, if you have some code that adds two numbers: sum = a + b You could create a `Function` to do it like so: Function Add(n1 As Integer, n2 As Integer) As Integer Return n1 + n2 End Function You have the function parameters in the parentheses, and the type of the result after (the last "As Integer"). To use the function, you replace the previous code with this: sum = Add(a, b) ' This calls the function, passing in "a" and "b" as "n1" and "n2" ' and assigns the returning result to "sum" So for your factorial, you'll have a `Function IngFactorial(n As Integer) As Integer` that you'll call to calculate the actual factorial and that you can reuse. Note that with `Integer`, a factorial function will overflow starting with 13!. You can use `Long` to get to 20!, or BigIntegers if you need to go much higher than that. 
You might be able to shave off some time by using `TableLayoutPanel.SuspendLayout()`/`ResumeLayout()` and adding all controls in one go with `AddRange()`, but WinForms just isn't built to handle huge amounts of controls like this. Even disregarding the slowness of WinForms layouting, I suspect that the underlying Win32 windowing system won't reasonably handle those numbers. If you want to go with WinForms, I would expect that the only viable option would be to simulate the individual grid cells by manually painting and handling the events of a single large control. Perhaps the DataGridView could work too, if you can mangle its options to look and behave like you want it to. You could also check out WPF, which features hardware accelerated rendering, or even an actual game/graphics framework that is built to handle this kind of stuff. That requires getting to learn those technologies, of course.
This makes sense. Just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something completely obvious. Thanks very much!
I think you'll find that building userControls will help manage some of this. It will certainly help manage the complexity that's going to show up as you go forward. So you build a control that represents a cell, and all of the items in it like textBoxes, labels, graphics, etc, and manages all of the click, update, draw, color change events, etc, and can manage it's own internal state throughout the game. Then you can populate the TLP with instances of that control, so that you aren't doing nearly the amount of event wiring, and reduce the number of controls that you are populating. You'll also definitely need to use .SuspendLayout and .ResumeLayout as /u/tweq suggested; this will allow the controls to be populated without any redraw / resize / repopulate logic being triggered. Even then, you'll likely find that you have too much happening to get super speedy load, but loading should be a one time event at game load, so it might be manageable. You might also create "quadrant" controls that contain say a 10*10 block of the "cell" control, and have them already laid out in their own TLP inside the quadrant control, then populate the main TLP with 10*10 of those "quadrant" controls. It would ultimately mean populating fewer instances dynamically, or potentially nothing dynamically, since you are really only building two 10*10 blocks (the 10*10 sub control, and the 10*10 block of sub controls). Of course that adds extra complexity to the communication between the main form, and the nested controls, but I think that everything being in one form would be really hard to deal with in the end anyway. Alternatively, you could look into WPF, as it is better at handling graphics, and stacking controls like this, but I'd still design the "cell" as a single UserControl that contains all of the code for managing the cell. 
This would be a more applicable example for you: Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Dim allTextBoxValues As String = "" Dim c As Control For Each c In Me.Controls If TypeOf c Is TextBox Then allTextBoxValues &amp;= CType(c, TextBox).Text &amp; "," End If Next If allTextBoxValues &lt;&gt; "" Then Me.Text = allTextBoxValues End If End Sub It should loop through all the text boxes on your form, and concatenate their values and display the combined output as the form's window title. The data is concatenated for each individual textbox via this line: `allTextBoxValues &amp;= CType(c, TextBox).Text &amp; ","` and it is here that you can reference each control by way of `c`.
Draw the board on your form. Instead of using winform controls. It will be way faster. use onClick, mouseMove etc. to recreate hovering &amp; click events. handle the form paint event and go from there. This approach will be way faster.
CODE: PictureBoxName.Location = New Point (PictureBoxName.Location.X + 5, PictureBoxName.Location.Y) to move it 5 pixels to the right
use an image processing library. I don't have a recommendation, but this is not a native feature.
Perhaps for you, like me, 10 seconds is more than enough to explain something, but there exists some people out there that need a bit more time to learn and understand something.

Because by default .NET applications are not multi threaded so everything plus the GUI is running on a single thread hence why your program will be completely unresponsive at even the slightest error. Because when that single thread gets an error it stops the thread, so not only is your code stopped, but the GUI is too. Multi threading and error handling is something you need to look into.
There's nothing that shouldn't work there. When you step through the code, you should be able to see than IncomeNumer is updated as soon as you pass that line, then you should be able to see it update dblIncome when you go back to the btnSubmit_Click event. What value is entered into the TextBox? 
I believe you need to loop. either loop the source range and only copy over rows that aren't empty, or loop after the copy and remove blank rows.
I think that there are some limitations such as usable file types and directory path length (255?). I just tested this and it worked: Private Declare Function mciSendString Lib "winmm.dll" Alias "mciSendStringA" _ (lpstrCommand As String, _ lpstrReturnString As String, _ uReturnLength As Integer, _ hwndCallback As Integer) As Integer Private Function CleanPath(path As String) As String Dim clean = Chr(34) &amp; path &amp; Chr(34) Return clean End Function Private Sub PlaySound(file As String, fileAlias As String) mciSendString(String.Format("Open {0} alias {1}", CleanPath(file), fileAlias), CStr(0), 0, 0) mciSendString(String.Format("Play {0}", fileAlias), CStr(0), 0, 0) End Sub Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click PlaySound("C:\pipe dream.wav", "whatever") PlaySound("C:\siven.wav", "whatever1") End Sub Clicking the button played both files simultaneously. It's important to note that each alias needs to be unique as it is the reference to the sound being played and handles commands to play, change volume, repeat, etc.
Timer tip aleady mentioned by u/ .. no wait. i'm not typing that! Anyway the tip is very useful. Hell it's ingenious!

There's a lot of information on this site: [Visual basic tutorials](http://www.visual-basic-tutorials.com/)
One task I gave myself was to make a ball bounce around in a window. And then I added some basic collision physics so the balls would bounce off of each other. It turned out pretty good. And then, just out of boredom, I made it so the three red, green, and blue balls exchange half their RGB values with each other when they collide. After a while, all three balls were this weird dull grey color. It was cool. Little experiments like that are what give people ideas for cool new games. All you need is a lot of curiosity and spare time.

The way you have it written out makes so much more sense. I didn't know you could even do it like that. (I'm only in the introduction VB class.) I did eventually get it working but i'm not 100% sure how. My code is horribly optimized but because time was short, I had to submit what I had. Thanks for that example though. I'm going to try that structure out next time.

What is the exact error message being displayed when it pops up?
unhandled exception has occurred in your application. If you click continue the application will ignore this error and attempt to continue. if you click quit, the application will close immediately. unable to cast COM object of type 'microsoft.office.interop.excel.applicationclass to interface type 'microsoft.office.interoo.excel._application' This operation failed because the queryinterface call on the COM component for the interface with IID '{000208D5-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}' failed due to the following error: Error loading type library/dll. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80029c4A (TYPE_E_CANTLOADLIBRARY)) So I tried to change (dim xlPortlandApp as new excel.application) to (dim xlPortlandApp as new excel.applicationclass) and (dim xlportlandwbk as excel.workbook) to (dim xlportlndwbk as excel.workbookclass) but it tells me "Reference to class 'ApplicationClass' is not allowed when its assembly is configured to embed interop types.
What libraries do you have imported in your project?
imports microsoft.office.interop imports microsoft.office.interop.outlook
Try adding in these libraries: Imports Microsoft.Office.Core Imports Excel = Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel
okay i tried adding those, and left the declaration of excel app and workbook variables alone, and went and tried it. I got the exact same exception message. So I came back over and opened the solution again to try to change application and workbook to applicationclass and workbookclass and it still says that it can't do that
I'm guessing you're right. I think generally speaking we should still help, but OP needs to ask specific questions. Or, I'll just end up posting some let me google that for you links that seem to piss everyone off :D

Wow. I'm so sorry.
should I help this guy ? 
There are workarounds for Windows 10.
Thanks, but admittedly that's not actually my code. You know how it is, much easier to just copy/paste.
Correct. That is what I was saying. You need to replace those else if with ElseIf. What the interpreter thinks you want to do when you do "else if" is something like:. If x=1 then Msgbox "hello" Else If y=2 then Msgbox "hi" End if End if 
I did make the change from "Else If" to "ElseIf" as you suggested, thanks for explaining the syntax! When I run the debug, it still says that the last line is a "Loop without do" error, 800A040E. It's confusing since the loop was already in the initial file, i guess I'm not understanding what it's asking for. Even searching for that error and seeing what others have encountered isn't really providing a guide on what I'm doing wrong. 
edit:It looks like there is an end if missing 
That seems to have fixed it. I must've just made a mistake when typing! Thank you for all your help!

At first glance it is running an application downloaded externally I think. The formatting is making it difficult to see. I expect it is a malware enabler.
Looks like a variation of [the one posted here a few days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/visualbasic/comments/5g2cd1/vbs_can_anyone_tell_me_what_this_script_does_got/), which was a malware dropper.
&gt; `ctrlAB.isRemoved` has no parameters, `ctrlAB.btnRemove_Click` has two, so they are obviously not compatible. But why would you handle the event with the method that raises the event anyway? At best you'll end up with an infinite loop. Okay, I'm confused. Are you saying I should include btnRemove's two parameters to the event? Like so: Public Event isRemoved(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) I looked back at the linked example from Stackoverflow and the event did not have any parameters: Public Class UserControl1 Public Event UC_Button1Click() 'right here Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click RaiseEvent UC_Button1Click() End Sub End Class Edit: I looked further into your suggestion and found [this](http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/132160-how-to-create-custom-events-for-user-control/). Would your suggestion be similar to this (at work right now so I can't test the code)? 'User control class Public Event TextBoxControl_TextChanged(ByVal sender Private Sub textbox_TextChanged(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles textbox.TextChanged RaiseEvent TextBoxControl_TextChanged(sender, e) End Sub 
&gt;Okay, I'm confused. Are you saying I should include btnRemove's two parameters to the event? **If** you want to subscribe `btnRemove_Click` to the `isRemoved` event, then they need the same signature. You'd have to either add the parameters to the event or remove the parameters from the method. But I don't think you do want this, because it doesn't make any sense.
Well, the end goal is to use AddHandler to subscribe to the btnRemove_click event. Do you mind expanding as to why that would not make any sense and why it would result to an infinite loop? I was under the impression that when I instantiated a copy of the ctrlAB as itemAB, it would subscribe to the isRemoved event. Now that I think about it, how would frmRecord determine if the event was raised? ie: to remove the itemAB from the _AB list, it needs to determine that the btnRemove was clicked, hence the need for an AddHandler.
`AddHandler [X], AddressOf [Y]` says "when the event `X` is raised, call the method `Y`". When `Y` is the same method that raises `X` in the first place, you end up with infinite recursion.
If it makes sense for your application, you could just use integer types for the divisor and the dividend. If you do that, the result will be zero. 
VB.NET will automatically perform floating point division even on integer types. You can force integer division by using the `\ ` operator, though.

Yep, and intentionally obfuscated = prob malware.
The algorithm they call "Primality 1" is the Solovay-Strassen test, which has been fairly well studied and has the property you mention. It has been superseded in practice by the Miller-Rabin test, which is essentially twice as efficient. "Primality 3" seems to be a version of this (though not formulated with efficiency in mind). Algorithm 2 is interesting and nice for this book, but looks disturbing for use. For most compositeness tests, there are three results: * definitely composite * probably prime * definitely prime The last (definitely prime) may be skipped by some methods, and proofs will skip the second. The point is that if it says composite, then it really is. Algorithm 2 is different in that it can return: * definitely composite * probably composite * probably prime Eek, we've added "probably composite" to the things returned. That is, now both primes and composites can get misidentified. This is different than how every other primality test in use works. It is also worse than the ubiquitous Miller-Rabin algorithm in terms of efficiency, as the latter allows a composite to pass at most n/4 bases. From a practical point of view, Miller-Rabin has a number of advantages. You can find implementations in many languages (e.g. [RosettaCode](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test)). Deterministic base sets exist for all 64-bit inputs, so if you restrict it to those inputs then it is no longer probabilistic and is very efficient. It's also one of the two components (along with the strong Lucas test) of BPSW, which is the primality testing algorithm used by most current math packages. Also deterministic for all 64-bit inputs.

Look up CRUD for vb.net and you should be able to find your answer pretty quickly
The end goal is to have a database already full of data (easy, hard, long, short questions etc.) Which others can add to if they wish.
As most of my program will rely on the data in the database.
Ya man, I hear you. Not much we can do about it. on the other hand I guess we did help.
Think of an array as a filing cabinet. Your filing cabinet can hold different things in it, but the things must be the same type in each drawer in the entire cabinet. Say you have a lot of papers you need to store. You make a filing cabinet with 20 drawers that can hold one paper in each drawer. Now translate this to an array, and you have an array that has 20 slots for one string variable in each slot. You can put all sorts of things into an array, even other arrays. Think of a filing cabinet where each drawer holds another filing cabinet. Just remember they're zero based, so the first drawer is `arr(0)` where `arr`is the name of your array.

Before, you will coding with option strict off (which is bad) as it tells the compiler to basically just assume things will work and it will try to automatically convert strings to numeric types, but has no actual error handling for when things go wrong (like when you say label1.text + 1 and the current text is not a number. Anyway, you could turn option strict off, and then it will work again as it did before, but the better solution is to actually convert your data types properly. So Label1.Text = (cint(label1.text) + 1).ToString() or even better yet, just use an actual integer variable to hold the value you are working with, and just assign the variable value to the text label when you want to display it. This also helps separate your code logic from your UI, so if some day you want to replace that label with some other control, your code logic stays the same, you just have to update your UI code. Dim myValue as integer myValue += 1 Label1.Text = myValue.ToString()
You can do it in 2 places. First off you can do it in settings (under tools -&gt; options -&gt; projects and solutions -&gt; VB Defaults) If you set Option Strict off in here, then it will make option strict be off for any NEW projects you start. However any existing projects you already have will use whatever was their setting when created. If you want to change option strict for an already existing project, you need to open the project up and under project properties in the compile tab, there is a dropdown to modify option strict on/off. A third thing, is that you can type option strict on or option strict off a the top of ANY code file (any .vb file) in your project, and then it will make option strict on or off JUST for that specific code file, which allows you to override the project level settings for individual code files.
A bit of context around your drawing code would be helpful, but I'm assuming you are painting on a control? Anything you draw on a control will be overwritten when that part is repainted, e.g. because the control is resized or the form/control moves in and out of view. You can manually force a full repaint by calling the control's `Refresh` method. 
On mobile right now, so didn't dig too deeply. A possible solution that I found, not sure if it would even function the way you need or not... https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ebkcs657(v=vs.110).aspx From what I'm seeing, it would make sense that you can call the begincontainer before drawing anything. When any one the check box states change, then call endcontainer and redraw and images that should be present. Not quite as elegant or nice with system resources if drawing a lot of images, but should work if this is how begin/end container works. Hope this helps!

I had problems with that myself and couldn't quite figure out what the designer was doing with the controls.

While I know that you asked for MS Access, but I unless the client (or the class) require it I would **HIGHLY** recommend using MS SQL Server (there is a free version) or another scalable db. MS Access is just going to give you heartache. How do I know? I started using Access on Day 1 ( Fall 1993) and while it has gotten better, much, using a SQL DB will give you so much more. Just food for thought.
C++ instead of Delphi, interesting. I never got into C++ because VB and Delphi were so much easier to work with. Good for you for knowing that level of a language.

Ah cool, didn't know about this until today!
that's exactly what I would expect from a method called ReadToEnd. I haven't use the Process library, but what you need is a loop or an event handler and a method that fetches new buffered output, then append that to the textbox.
Ah, I see. Could you please provide an example? Thanks!

What tool and what account? im sorry, i dont really get what you're saying. edit : do you mean like an SQL manager opening the same database while the App running?
the stand alone sqlite tools. and the user account you are logged in as. it may be a sqlite lock setting I dont' know about, or maybe you have file permission issues. it's almost certainly a sqlite issue and not a VB one.
SQLite is a file based database. The usual way these get the locked message are that the file is still connected to an open connection. This seems ok in your code for you are closing the connection and the end of each sub. The second way is another program has the file open. Sometimes when an exe stops (closes) it still is open in the background. Check your process list to see if there is anything that is still connected. Thirdly and this is a longshot in your case, make sure the file is not readonly.

That code displays it in debug, but actually only moves it a tiny way once in the program, and then just displays debug messages from then on.

&gt;I'm all for learning how to do it in VB.NET and breaking my PHP ways, but I can't get my head around how I would do it, without creating my own Classes for storing the data, or using a heap of Dictionaries inside of ArrayLists or something similar. Well... that's exactly how you'd do it. Your question is basically the same as *"I'm all for learning how to do something in PHP, but I can't get my head around how to loop through something without using `for` or `foreach` or something like that"*. I'm not sure what kind of answer you're looking for here.
Well, I wouldn't say THAT! As for/foreach are fairly common between all languages, but this kind of thing I don't think it is, 'cause I haven't had to come up against it before. In any case, if that's how we do it, I'm all good with that .. I was just hoping there was an easier way :P Thanks!
Thanks dude, I'll check it out and hopefully it'll give me what I'm after!
Just wanted to chime in on Classes and structures. Coming from a less sophisticated background, I never really understood classes and structures, but once you get your head wrapped around it, especially for debugging they are both just amazing.
Where you're using a shared database that is accessed by multiple users or applications.
Could you elaborate on that please? 
what do you think line 43 does?
`1 to 30 step 30` is only 1 step
Oh my gosh, so i took the step 30 out and it worked. btw thank you so much. I really have no one to go though this with, so i end up creating more problems. THANK YOU!
Yes. Just start it like any other app. There are great examples on MSDN.
I understand if it seems like I'm asking for some pro bono work, but it really wasn't my intention. I admit this VB is new to me and all I know about it is from one introductory lecture I had at school. Next time I have to propose a project so I had this idea and just wanted to see how complicated it would be to put in the code. I've tried to find some reading materials online but English is not my native language and I don't really know what to search for to get started. So thanks for the link and info. I think that's going to be great for what i need. Most of the examples I found don't work in my case. 
No worries, I mention it so that you can phrase your questions so that we don't think that and you get the answers you need. 
Yes please, thank you. I really need to know how to do it for my project.
Your a fucking retard
both inner and outer throw this same error "A first chance exception of type 'System.NullReferenceException' occurred in HomeTest.exe Additional information: Object reference not set to an instance of an object. If there is a handler for this exception, the program may be safely continued."

You stated back in your /r/excel thread that you enabled the built-in buttons for this feature, but would prefer a hotkey combo instead. If it is also an interest of yours, you could build the same feature as a standalone program in VB.NET. This would teach you more VB, and solve your problem at the same time.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12933279/how-to-comment-and-uncomment-blocks-of-code-in-the-office-vba-editor/23954017#23954017
Would I make a program to allow this specific keyboard shortcut? Would this be a large project that I would need to dedicate a few days to or something I could get done in a few hours? I'm currently toying with excel at work in my time between tasks. I'm not really ready for a huge VB project yet
I've done that. I don't want to click a button, I want to use a keyboard combination. Something like CTRL + ' or ALT + /
You obviously didn't do it or you wouldn't have missed the instructions on how to turn that icon into a shortcut key (ALT+C in the instructions). I just did it myself and it allowed me to select text and hit ALT+C to comment each line.
I've never seen anyone do this before.
you only need to do this when the normal rules for interpreting a literal's type will cause problems, usually when you need to enforce long integer math on numbers that are small enough that they don't get treated an longs. I don't know why you'd need to do this to a 0.2. 
I'd guess not. The shortcut key method is a kludge in and of itself.
simple string concatenation.
 Dim discountPercent = .2 'this is a double Dim discountPercent = .2D 'this is a decimal Dim discountPercent as Decimal = .2D 'this is redundant This is how I would actually use it. Dim numberOfItems = 15 Dim cost = numberOfItems * .25D 'cost is forced to be a decimal 
You're probably not actually getting the document. I've had to do in the past - Dim topFrame As HtmlWindow = WebBrowser1.Document.Window.Frames(0). Inspect the browser object in debug and see if you need to get the window and frame that actually contain the elements.
Honestly I'll cheat and throw the block inside of an if/then block with the condition of If True = False then...
Lol! That is one of the best lazyman workarounds I've ever heard
Your page may not have a frame. It depends on the page, so you'll need to examine the document object in debug to check to see where everything is. FYI, you can probably do all this by simply running javascript on the page.
The answer to this is based upon a couple of things. Does your enemy ignore or go around obstacles? Can you enemy duplicate what the player is doing? I would suggest this primer on the many ways path finding can be done is a great place to start. http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/28041/path-finding-algorithms
I want it to ignore the obstacles. Thanks for the link
That converts your document into *an array of bytes*
This is very much possible. The method in which you need to enter the data into this third party application is what determines how feasible the end result is. --- You can use sendkeys to enter the information. * This means you'll have to know exactly when to begin sending keystrokes. * You will have to ensure the target application is in focus and is ready to receive said keystrokes. * If another application gains focus, your keystrokes will not be sent to the correct application. * If extra keys are pressed during the sendkeys time frame, you will have entered incorrect data. --- Alternatively, you can use the sendmessage API. This is far more complicated than using sendkeys however, so your mileage may vary. Sendmessage allows you to set the values of specific control objects in just about any standard windows form in any application. The only caveat to this: * You have to be able to identify the exact ID of the application window and control objects. * You'll have to do this dynamically in case control object IDs change between forms. But, with sendmessage you gain the ability to never send incorrect data as this is completely independent of the end user. It's much faster than sendkeys as you do not need to wait for key presses to be simulated. This won't work however, if the target application does not use standard windows forms to display information, or interact with the user.
exactly this. I once made something like this to automate Exchange 5.5's admin gui to move a mail boxes from an old server to a new one, took about 10 keystrokes per mailbox. adding a small pause in places that could error and a "stop" button allowed handling anything unexpected, and setting my form to be always on top made sure I could always reach that button, even when my app didn't have focus, which it wouldn't.
First suggestion: set a breakpoint on the "Order = ..." line and see what userLabel.Text contains. It might not contain what you think it does. Second suggestion: try trimming userLabel.Text. If it has any leading or trailing spaces then the update statement might not find the row you expect it to. The reason it's not showing any error is because SQL is fine with an update that doesn't affect any rows. That's not an error. Finally, I assume this is just school work but if not, you need to learn about SQL Injection. This code is WIDE open for it.

Nice simple one; Runs whenever an item is received. Private Sub Items_ItemAdd(ByVal item As Object) If TypeName(item) = "MailItem" Then Set Msg = item strname = Msg.Subject Msg.SaveAs Environ("HOMEPATH") &amp; "\My Documents\" &amp; strname &amp; ".txt", olTXT End If End Sub
I've not used them, but there are interfaces to iterate the connected drives and tell if it's USB or not. from there you can look at the drive's contents, or it's USB identifier data (like the device ID and serial number) to see if it's what you want and default the drive selection, but it's best to still allow the users to select the drive in case they have more than one connected. 
You can use [`System.IO.DriveInfo`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.driveinfo.aspx) to enumerate drives and find out if they are removable. To go more in-depth, you can query [WMI](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb404655.aspx) collections such as `Win32_LogicalDisk` and `Win32_DiskDrive`, which will give you more information about the specific partition and device. However, ultimately you **must** ask the user for the desired drive and for confirmation. They might have multiple USB keys plugged in, they might have a USB hard drive containing important data connected, they might have copied additional files on the same stick used by your application, they might have created multiple partitions on the same device etc. Don't just blindly delete all the data on whatever drive you believe to be the correct one. 
Im changing the code right now to use getDirectoryName of the exe the thing is im scared people win run the program of their pc instead of the Usb key and delete Stuf on their pc or other drive... same thing if i let them choose the drive they could pick another Usb or even c:\ and then delete their Pc lol can i some how add some thing that would only run the Directory. Delete only if its running from the Usb key or if the end of path is the name of the usb key They will all be named the same 
No worries. Always remember the debugger is your friend. I can't think of a day in my professional life where I didn't use a debugger (or a print statement if a debugger wasn't an option). It's amazing how often your code doesn't do what you think it does. Often the only way to break your assumption is to step through it and find out what it's actually doing. Then you have that DOH!! moment and move on :)
Ever considered saving your chapters to your local hard drive? Dim sw As New StreamWriter(fullPathOfFileName_ &amp; currentChapter &amp; ".txt", False) sw.Write(textToBeWritten) sw.Close()
You have to save the file somewhere (it's not possible to write to resources, as they are compiled into the app). You can certainly hide files in Windows, and you don't have to save as pure text, but I see no reason not to just save it somewhere. 
I find it fun to implement simple games. Some I did: * Minesweeper * Pong * Tic Tac Toe * Solitaire * Flow Free * Nanosweeper * Flood It * Sudoku * Snake * Monopoly * Bomberman You can also think of programming your own AI for some of these, e.g. Pong and Tic Tac Toe, that are comparably easy.
Calculators are simple and good for learning control and variable interaction.

To answer your question is yes you can make multiplayer games. There is two types of multiplayer. Server and peer to peer. Either requires Socket programming.

No you can insert chr(13) (vbcrlf) into the string to make it appear on multiple lines. Sub Main() Dim firstLine As String = "This is the first line."

If you're still learning, begin with a simple [chat networking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSiBbtxWpI8) tutorial. Once you figure out the basics of this project, perhaps you can move on from there to more advance topics. 
Assuming you are using Visual Studio the System Namespace is one of a few which is imported automatically each time you start a new project. You can see those by going to your project settings and to the resources tab. I'm not sure why it wasn't there. It usually only suggests you to remove the imports statement if it's not needed but shouldn't automatically remove it. Afaik the () are required and at least in VS2015 it's actually impossible to call a Sub/Function... without VS adding them for you.(at least with standard settings)

Hello Cristobal, maybe you want to give your question another try? I am sorry but i really don't understand what you are looking for. And i think others had the same problem. Also you maybe want to ask /r/excel, depending on what you exactly want, you can do a lot in excel without actual vba programming.
&gt;Besides, the Sample demonstrates how to access data from SQL Server database in Windows10 UWP app. Please notice that we cannot directly access SQL Server Database from Windows 10 UWP app. Instead, we have to create a Service layer to access the database.

As tweq said, you should first think about converting the txtEnterANumber.Text (which is a string) to a numeric type. From there, you have access to all of the math and conversion functions and it's very easy. His links give all the info you need. To elaborate a little, I suggest the following ideas: * You should check to see if the input is numeric first. If not, do something useful like output a message. * Assuming it is numeric, apply a math or conversion function to do what you want. The nice thing about the function to format numbers is that it takes the format as a parameter, so doing different formats is very easy to do and understand. 
I hate giving advice because I feel like I'm so outdated. So people feel free to correct me. You're using a sqlDataReader to pull your information but you're not storing the information anywhere in order to access it. This is the main issue. You really should set up a sqldataadapter and then use that to fill a dataset. Then you can bind your dataset to a control. Look up how to create a SQLDataAdapter. You already seem to be using a data adapter and are filling datasets on your form right now: Me.PassFailTableAdapter.Fill(Me.Rfqualityfryers.PassFail) Me.Oil_typesTableAdapter.Fill(Me.Rfqualityfryers1.oil_types) Learn to set up a parameterized select query in your dataadapter. SQLDataAdapter - https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqldataadapter(v=vs.110).aspx

If you're trying to make your code handle multiple similar objects, then I'd create exactly that, objects. You'd be applying animation to all your objects at once, versus just one at a time. Do you understand arrays? Classes? Structures? If not, I highly recommend understanding those three things before continuing with this project. You'll be iterating through arrays for many video games such as this.
[removed]
I understand how classes and arrays work somewhat but VB seems to use them in a different ways to other languages or rational thought which is why im struggling to comprehend this issue. I will of course do more research into classes, arrays and structures but do you have any ideas to solve my problem anyway?
Oh man, thanks ! Your answer hit my question straight on.
moderation is certainly an option, but a lot of work. that spam hit many subs, and seems to have gotten more complex as it went. it's a really something the main reddit team should be involved in. 
What form does your database take? Is it a proper database? An external text file? A hard-coded array?
the simplest way is this: on the onclickevent of your forms button, put this code textbox2.text = textbox1.text textbox1.clear 'if you want to clear the first textbox at the same time. some syntax hints in case you want to do it the long way. ?? textbox1.focus() 'gives the focus to textbox1. textbox1.selectall () 'selects (highlights) all the text Clipboard.GetText(TextBox1.Text) 'gets the text from the textbox 1 onto the clipboard. Clipboard.SetText(TextBox2.Text) 'pastes the text into textbox 2 You can use With so you dont need to keep typing textbox1 for example tell the system which control start with the WITH and the control name. With textbox1 'now specify which property and what value by putting a dot . and the property name and value. .focus() .backcolor = color.black .forecolor = color.red .selectall() 'now tell it your finished setting the properties of textbox1 End with quite simple really. Note: when using the clipboard, you dont have to do any highlighting. Just not needed to get all the text from a textbox. You can do more complicated things like get certain characters using string.length and string.replace and all kinds of manipulation on strings, but that's further down the line. ;)
It's Access database, if that's what you meant 
1) You want to sort the array prior to running through the loop. 2) Have an additional variable, during the loop check if the current array value is the same as the variable. If NOT, then display the value and then set the variable to the current array value. 
Hi, ok. Then you're going to need to identify the child window of the game (the chatbox) you're passing to into to tell your app where to put the generated string. This is going to mean you're delving into the windows API. Perfectly possible in in VB.net, but beyond my experience. I did have a quick look around though. this guy seems have knocked something together similar to what you are wanting to achieve: http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/70702-how-to-sendretrieve-data-across-programstext/ I hope this is helpful to you. 
You're welcome.
Yeah... for example: Selecting all items from ID column based on a criteria and returning it as a list: ContextName.TableName.Where(Function(x) (x.Col1 = Cond1).[Select](Function(x) x.ID).ToList()

I made a date calculator. Basically it subtracts one date from another date and gives the difference in range. then i also gave it the abilty to calculate the date and day of week in x-amount of hours/days/weeks/months/yearsz (both addition and subtraction) Then i made it be able to exclude certain days of the week, then exclude weekends when doing the caclulation. then i made it exclude a date range range AND weekends.. etc. It's a deceptively nice simple start, but gets rather complicated as it grows. So the challenge is ongoing, which I enjoy. There's also many things to add to it and improve all the time. Such as adding a configuration file or creating a default one if it can't find one. Also, Printing, diary, database, exporting to other calendar formats, importing/extracting, hooking into outlook... etc. It just grow and grows. Gr8 fun and brilliant learning tool that'll never end. Try it. :-)
Well, you could store the information in a text file but I was referring to using a database. Here is some information on that. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms171884.aspx

It was a pretty fun task, got frustrating at times but rewarding when it worked. Stuff like deciding what a minor error is was a pain.
I hope it will work out well :D 
For what it is worth, I use a similar resolution and screen to code, and don't have any problems with the IDE or the apps that I create. 
I just think it's confusing, because what determines if it is "Not"? If the Function can return both a True and False value, then what determines if `isPressnt` is `Not`? I've never understood what makes it "be" and "not be" so to say
[removed]
After examining this a bit more, am I wrong in saying that if isTrue = False Then 'This will execute because even though isTrue is false, isTrue = False is true End If functions **much** differently than If Not isTrue Then 'This executes because Not says compare against the opposite of the current boolean 'If you wrap that in paranthesis it's becomes a little less confusing. 'If (Not isTrue) Then ... If (Not False) Then = If (True) Then. 'Because isTrue = false, Not isTrue = true and a true result will execute the if block's code. End If
Yes you would be wrong. Both statements are exactly the same. Try imagine in with numbers instead. Imagine a Number which can only be one (true) or zero (false). Nothing else. Also rename your variable to something better like maybe "Decision" and you will see the following If Decision = 0 then and if not Decision (=1 is implied) Also i would advice you to stay on this topic until you get your head around. Booleans are the most basic concept in logic and something you really need to know in programming 
I remember having problems with the cookies as well. I used something called a [cookieawarewebclient](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2825377/how-can-i-get-the-webclient-to-use-cookies). maybe this helps you too
Just do the opposite of what you do to make it go right?
i tried it , it does not work
Perhaps post the code you have tried that does not work?
Post your code mate, I don't mind helping, but I need to see where you're at and having problems.
I think you're basically describing a template system. basically any uncommon character can be used for a tag system, but the real magic comes with how you actually do the replacement. there isn't any kind of standard. things like {verb1} and %verb1% are common, or named labels like $verb1 for the capital, you'd either know that it needs capitalized because of its label, or you can do find the label and use the various string functions to find the previous non-whitespace characer and decide based on that. 
You say you know how to make it go right. Copy and paste the code that makes it go right, and we'll keep going from there.
lblX is the label that needs to move around. If lblx.Left &lt; Me.Width Then lblx.Left = lblx.Left + 1 End If
Need a boolean to track which direction it's going, then just check position and boolean and act accordingly. Dim increasing As Boolean = True Private Sub Timer1_Tick(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Timer1.Tick If increasing Then If lblx.Left + 1 &lt; Width Then lblx.Left = lblx.Left + 1 Else increasing = False End If Else If lblx.Left &gt; 1 Then lblx.Left = lblx.Left - 1 Else increasing = True End If End If End Sub

Sexy lambda goodness. Bravo!
Pretty much adding records but I can't get it to save to the ctual Access Database.
Sorry forgot to specify. It's winforms
This looks good, I will definitely try this out. Edit: tried it, worked great. I'll have to play around with it tomorrow to see if I can get the background to be transparent on the line item form as well as get text to wrap in the labels but it looks good other than that.
If I'm understanding you right, then I will say that the "template" is saved in a folder and is the same workbook the Macro resides in so I would think it should be saving it in the correct folder too, which is why I am confused.
no, when you make a document from a template, it's not related to the template any more. it has no path, empty string. if the macro isn't in the template, that's a different issue.
This would have been my answer as well. Glad it worked out for you.
Ok, thanks. I'll try that out tomorrow 
Dude, thanks! I will update with the results. I'm exploring another option with a multivalue field I found in one of the tables that I can use as source data. But your answer has totally unclustered my brain, and I will definitely be using this going forward.
Hey thanks! I don't have any of the code typed out as of now. I have a habit of writing it all out before I do it to work out the logistical pieces first. I will however update once I have it all set. I did find a multi value field that I can use as my source data so that will make things a little easier.
That has to be it.... It works 100% as desired now. Thank you so soooooooo much
try changing newline to richtextbox1.text and see what happens
It has to be in the loop though, doesn't it? I'm using it as a static string, that gets altered to the line read each time. I suppose I could make it a listOfStrings that gets populated in the loop then write it out of the loop
Oh. Well yes I very well could. This code however is more of a proof of concept. Showing that it could be done. The rich text box was just my way of showing that the code was working. In the ultimate application it's probably going to be done all behind the users perception and no text box needed.
TY, hopefully it catches more like those two earlier today.
What are your inputs? Integers don't allow decimals, so make sure there isn't any punctuation in the text boxes
It's probably because of the 7th line, in which you are attempting to add an Integer to `vbNewLine` (A String). Try casting the integer to a String, before concatenating it. 
Do i add Cstr in front of 'cinilac'
Do you by any chance know how could i check all the factors of that number? Would i need a list for that or would a text box suffice?
That event looks fine. What I meant is that you're not appending the text, but overwriting. e.g. txtWhatever.Text = NewText + vbNewLine rather than txtWhatever.Text = txtWhatever.Text + NewText + vbNewLine If this doesn't work, perhaps try to append the text to a temporary variable and use a MessageBox to display it before the end of the function - to check whether the factor finding code is working properly. e.g. Dim Factors as String = "" If CheckBox1.Checked = True Then For factor = 1 To XY If X Mod factor = 0 And Y Mod factor = 0 Then Factors = Factors + CStr(factor) + vbNewLine End If Next End If Messagebox.Show(Factors)
It wouldn't matter on the first iteration of the loop. However, on subsequent iterations, the new factor will overwrite the old factor. e.g. we have found 2 factors a = "" firstFactor = "1" secondFactor = "2" ----------------------------------------------- ' Overwriting - Result is "2" + vbNewline a = firstFactor + vbNewline a = secondFactor + vbNewline ' Appending - Result is "1" + vbNewline + "2" + vbNewline a = a + firstFactor + vbNewline a = a + secondFactor + vbNewline
Have you tried the code that I have written above, with the MessageBox? Perhaps check whether your TextBox is single or multi-line. If it can only displays one line, turn it into multi-line TextBox or use a Label/ListBox. **Edit:** Now that I think about it, try backspacing on the TextBox. Since the last line will be a new line, the last factor might be hidden, so you see nothing. 
Ok i worked it out , turns out i declared XY outside the IF which it involves, so i declared it inside the IF so it knows what XY is, but thank you a lot for your help , i deeply thank you and i really appreciate it and you taught me a couple of things. Cheers!
Glad that I could help. Here's the code for the aforementioned methods.

You could probably pass your factors through CalculateFactors and make sure the count is only 2 (1 and the number you passed in). So if you passed in 11, the only factors that work are 1 and 11 (count of 2).

Looks like I will be jumping into C# then. What did you do to help you switch? Books, online courses?

You have to stop thinking in terms of VB vs. C#. If you're a decent .NET dev, you'll learn either of those languages within a week because the differences are miniscule. I was a C++ programmer and got a job in .NET with VB. Next job was C# mostly. It doesn't really matter.
First, threading is hard. Even something as simple-looking as this demonstrates that. What I would do is have two variables, one for each text box. When thread 1 updates text box 1, it sets flag 1 to true. When thread 2 updates text box 2, it sets flag 2 to true. Then you watch both of those flags (using the main thread or polling using a timer) and do your final action when both flags are set.
I started small. I took a VB.net project, added a C# project to the solution, and started converting methods/classes to the C# project. Eventually enough was done that I had re-written the entire application in C# and I just deleted the VB project. That provided me with the baseline I needed to go further. Never read any books on C#, though I did watch a few videos in Microsoft's Virtual Academy to get some basic syntax, possibly watched a few videos on pluralsight. In many instances though, the difference between the two languages is basically non-existant. VB.net MessageBox.Show("Message") C# MessageBox.Show("Message");
Alot of old companies still use vb.net applications.
That's a pretty good idea, I think that I just need to somehow setup some variables to hold the old value and compare it to the new one using the text.modified property to see if it's true or not. This code is already in a timer that checks every second if the text has updated, So that's good. If I was to check both properties at the same time and do something if they both are true would this work? I'm just not sure if joining them with an and is the correct way. If FileName1.Modified = True And FileName2.Modified = True Then 
That looks fine to me. I didn't know there was a "Modified" property. Is that set when the text box is updated via code, or just when a user changes the value?
I have no clue, I just assumed it would change no matter what changes the value. I'm onto something, no luck yet but I'll keep working at it. edit: according to this https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.textboxbase.modified(v=vs.110).aspx If you change the Text property programmatically, the Modified property reverts to false. This does not raise the ModifiedChanged event. hhmm
Generally speaking C# jobs are easier to find and pay more. VB jobs do exist, but you have to look harder for them.
As /u/IHateMyHandle has said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/visualbasic/comments/5swpx0/factors_of_2_numbers/ddj97w8/), you could count the factors of each common factor. When the count is 2 (the two factors being 1 and the number itself), the number is prime. Alternatively, you can write a function to determine whether a number is prime. When you have determined the primality of the factor, you could then display it when it's prime and not display it when it's not prime. 
Would i need to use a for ? If so where could i use it?
You would need to write the code to determine whether the factor is prime One way to do this is to use a function `IsPrime`, or if you prefer, a function which computes the number of factors of a particular number: If X Mod factor = 0 AndAlso Y Mod factor = 0 AndAlso IsPrime(factor) Then ' Both X and Y are divisible by factor and factor is prime End If Alternatively, use a flag and do it sequentially: If X Mod factor = 0 AndAlso Y Mod factor = 0 Then ' Both X and Y are divisible by factor Dim isPrime As Boolean = True ' Insert code which determines whether the factor is prime and ' set isPrime to False if the factor is not prime ' As soon as a factor (excluding 1 and the number itself) is found, ' you can exit the for loop (since the number is not prime) If isPrime Then ' Both X and Y are divisible by factor and factor is prime End If End If **Edit:** The first way is probably more preferable than the second. 
Thanks a lot!
Not entirely sure, but the first thing I'd do is make sure you understand the difference between the various Integers in VB.NET, and VB6. Copying and pasting code between the two isn't possible in many cases, and is especially bad when dealing with COM based interfaces that are sending data in different sizes. You'll have to ensure that you rewrite the calls to use the correct size integers. So ... VB6 = .NET Integer = Short Long = Integer And there is no VB6 equivalent for a .NET Long. A few other thoughts ... you don't show the declaration for barcodes in the first code block, but make sure it's what you expect to be returned by the function. The following call also looks suspect: CSP2.csp2ReadRawData(aByteBuffer(0),CSP2.DETERMINE_SIZE) It appears that you are calling it with a single byte, what should you be sending?
yeah never knew VB6 existed till I got this thing The byte according to the manual should be a buffer which it fills and so not sending it anything but I do have good news, turns out the Symbol CS1504 is identical to the Opticon OPN-2001 and the latest DLL file for that scanner is from 2016 and is .net loaded the DLL and changed some of the functions to the much simpler Opticon varients and boom data is flowing now So guess this is solved and the problem was stop dinking around with a DLL from 2003 and find a compatible alternative
Your best bet is going to be reading up on both the Outlook and Excel object models. These will expose all of the properties/methods/functions of these apps that you can utilize in tour VB app. The assumption here is that you have both of those applications installed on your development system and can add the appropriate references. Try using [Automating Outlook from a Visual Basic Application](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb206737.aspx) as a starting point and see where that gets you. Granted, its assuming Outlook 2007, but you'll get the rough idea none the less.
If you only have a few items to choose from I'd set it up as an if-then/elseif/etc or select/case. If you have many items you may want a smarter way to do it
You're ordering by a random number? Each time you run it, the dataset will be sorted on a different column. (I think)
All people seem to want is something to work, make sure it works. I'd hire an ace VB programmer over a less knowledgeable or passionate c# programmer for a C# job. More likely to actually deliver a solution. In my experience, I don't know the exact best way to write in every language but I'm real good at one and that has provided more opportunities than I can handle (never lie or oversell your knowledge, you'll be found out when things break and never get better)
You may also find SQL Server Data Tools to be useful. https://www.infoq.com/articles/SSDT-Intro I wrote the article so feel free to ask me questions.
Erm, care to elaborate more on your variables and formula you described there? I think you're missing a few pieces. Gross = 12012 PAYE = .20 = 2402.4 PRSI = 0.04 = 480.48 USC = 0.01 = 120.12 --- PAYE - PRSI - USC = 2402.4 - 480.48 - 120.12 = 1801.8 Gross - Tax = 12012 - 1801.8 = 10210.2 Final / 52 weeks = 10210.2 / 52 = 196.35 Looks like gibberish to me.
If you are talking about this: PAYE = .20 = 2402.4 PRSI = 0.04 = 480.48 USC = 0.01 = 120.12 PAYE - PRSI - USC = 2402.4 - 480.48 - 120.12 = 1801.8 Gross - Tax = 12012 - 1801.8 = 10210.2 Final / 52 weeks = 10210.2 / 52 = 196.35 That's only me manually calculating the maths of the program to make sure that the program is calculating the maths correctly, it isn't the actual code.
I meant separating all your variables into new lines to keep everything clearly separated. Right now it looks like a long equation, which it clearly isn't supposed to be, but because of your formatting, it unfortunately looks like one. And preferably a clearer example of the formula you are using without checking your own math inside of the formula. You are convoluting what should be a clear picture of what you intend with what you are expecting.
What do you recommend I do?
I meant to do this, so people like myself can clearly see the variables you are working with. Right now, I'm seeing this: Gross = 12012 PAYE = .20 = 2402.4 PRSI = 0.04 = 480.48 USC = 0.01 = 120.12 What's `480.48` have to do with anything else in there? It appears to be included as if you have a missing variable between PRSI and USC. Help us help you by simplifying the information you are trying to convey. Otherwise I will continue helping others as topics are posted in other subs.
Currently, I'm not fully understanding what you're trying to ask. You're asking about my calculations I did myself on paper to ensure the program does what it's supposed to do and the variables in the program are declared correctly as far as I know, it's just not calculating the right number so it's either a logical error or something wrong I am doing with the maths side of the program
All they're asking you to do is editing your post so your calculations are properly split into multiple lines instead of one long line, i.e. a b c instead of a b c
you could get rid of all those nested try-catches if you used ' Integer.TryParse() ' instead. Like dis: Try Dim BeginningOdometerInteger, EndingOdometerInteger, MileageInteger, NumberOfDaysInteger As Integer if Not Integer.TryParse(BeginningOdometerTextBox.Text, BeginningOdometerInteger) throw new FormatException("BeginningOdometer") ' repeat for the other user input if EndingOdometerInteger &gt; BeginningOdometerInteger throw new InvalidOperationException("Beginning odometer value can't be greater than ending odometer value.") Catch ex as FormatException MessageBox.Show(ex.Message + " is invalid.") Catch ex as InvalidOperationException MessageBox.Show(ex.Message) TryParse returns a boolean value for whether the input was an Integer and also passes the output integer by reference so if the function returns true, it also sets the value of the integer. This way you only have to use one try-catch (try-catches are kinda expensive so the less the better) and you can probably wow your professor by using different catch blocks for different types of exceptions.
You have a Select case against USC but USC is never assigned a value before that block of code is hit. So USC = 0.0. Stepping through the code is always hitting the first case. (not sure why because 0.0 is not greater than or equal to 12012), but I think you want to use Case Is &gt;= 12012 and not Case USC as that is what the select is based off of. But again, is USC what you're really after here, as you set its value inside the case conditions so I'm thinking you're wanting to select on some other value. You have this same issue above with setting a value to netIncome. PAYE_Result and USC are both 0.0 at the time that line is ran so basically all that line is doing is setting NetIncome = 12012 - (480.48) - 0 - 0. 
I'll give that a go and get back to you on it. :)
Alright... I think the calculation is correct now, well it gave me the answer I manually did at the very top and one more thing, after the calculation is done, the USC from the first value doesn't change so what I mean is that when I give it let's say, "12012" and the USC of that would be 120.12 and when I try another value, the USC box still says 120.12 but everything else is calculated from the second value I enter.. How can I fix this?. Also, thank you so much for helping :) 
Can you show your select case block of code again after your fixes? I'm assuming that if you are getting a correct result, you've made some changes to this area of code. 
I might revert the &gt;=12012 to &lt;=12012 since I think that will make more sense because it will take the value from 0 to 12012 
Assuming that 12012 isn't a magic, start taxing number, then I would think you would start at any value that would be taxed at .01 For example, if I pay someone over 599.00, I am suppose to send them a 1099 for tax purposes. So we can assume that 600 is the number that begins taxation. In that case you could have something like: Select Case Amount Case 0 to 599 TaxRate = 0 Case 600 to 12012 TaxRate = .01 Case 12013 to 18668 TaxRate = .03 Case 18669 to 70044 TaxRate = .055 Case Is &gt; 70044 TaxRate = .08 Case Else 'Display an error, because the user must have typed a negative number End Select Of course, this is just a demo, in this case anything above 70044 would be taxed at .08. And yes, the Select case is a short-circuit in that once a condition is met, there is no more checking and you were covering everything above 12011 in your first Case condition meaning that everything was being taxed at .01.
I've been doing multiple manual calculations for the calculator above the 12012 mark and I'm not getting the right answer at one calculation I did, I got close to one answer. Here's the one I got close to the calculator got. Which one is right?: Gross = 13000 PAYE = .20 * 13000 = 2600 PRSI = 0.04 * 13000 = 520 USC = 0.03 * 13000 = 390 2600 - 520 - 390 = 1690 1690- 13000 = 11310 [ANSWER I GOT = 217.5]` [VB ANSWER = 212.5]
I've listed the entire code below and I don't think I've been shown about breakpoints. Will I give that ago then? 'Code' Public Class Calculator 'Variable Declaration' Dim UserInput As Single '= Single.Parse(UserInputBox.Text) Dim PAYE_20 As Single = 0.2 Dim PAYE_Result As Single Dim PRSI As Single = 0.04 Dim USC As Single 'NESTED' Dim NetIncome As Single Private Sub CalculateButton_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles CalculateButton.Click 'Get data from textbox' 'UserInputBox.Text = Convert.ToSingle(UserInput) UserInput = UserInputBox.Text 'PAYE' If UserInput &lt;= 33800 Then PAYE_Result = UserInput * PAYE_20 '- 3300 PAYEbeforeTAXbox.Text = UserInput PAYEafterTAXbox.Text = PAYE_Result ElseIf UserInput &gt;= 33800 Then PAYE_Result = UserInput * (PAYE_20 * 2) '- 3300 PAYEbeforeTAXbox.Text = UserInput PAYEafterTAXbox.Text = PAYE_Result End If 'USC' Select Case UserInput Case Is &gt;= 12012 'Taxes at 1% USC = UserInput * 0.01 USCbox.Text = USC Case Is &gt; 12012 And USC &lt;= 18668 'Taxed at 3%' USC = UserInput * 0.03 USCbox.Text = USC Case Is &gt; 18668 And USC &lt;= 70044 'Taxted at 5.5%' USC = UserInput * 0.055 USCbox.Text = USC Case Is &gt; 70044 And USC &lt;= 100000 'Taxed at 8%' USC = UserInput * 0.08 USCbox.Text = USC End Select 'Get the total sum' NetIncome = UserInput - (PAYE_Result - (PRSI * UserInput) - USC) 'Rest of the Output boxes' 'Gross Salary' GrossSalaryBox.Text = UserInput 'PRSI' PRSIbox.Text = PRSI * UserInput 'Net Income' AnnualNetBox.Text = NetIncome MonthlyNetBox.Text = NetIncome / 12 WeeklyNetBox.Text = NetIncome / 52 End Sub Private Sub Calculator_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load End Sub End Class 
OK, I may have thrown you off with the Select case from earlier. I was trying to show an example of how you would look for ranges of numbers without actually giving you the full solution. I had discovered after I gave it that even the code I showed still had the comparison to USC in it and you're still doing it in your code. Try changing your select case to: Select Case UserInput Case 12012 'Taxes at 1% USC = UserInput * 0.01 USCbox.Text = USC Case 12013 To 18668 'Taxed at 3%' USC = UserInput * 0.03 USCbox.Text = USC Case 18669 To 70044 'Taxted at 5.5%' USC = UserInput * 0.055 USCbox.Text = USC Case 70045 And 100000 'Taxed at 8%' USC = UserInput * 0.08 USCbox.Text = USC End Select Notice here how we are using the To keyword to check for a range of numbers. Case 12013 To 18668 This is checking if userinput is any number from 12013 to 18668 and I think that is where the problem is coming from. As far as breakpoints, here's a quick and dirty (very short) test you can play around with. Go into your code and click on the Select Case line and press F9. You should see a red dot appear to the left of the code window. This is a breakpoint. F9 will clear it too (it's a toggle) anyway, with the breakpoint set, run your application and enter 70066 (this should hit the 8% case statement) and click on the button. Notice that immediately, you're taken to the code window. Press F11 to step through the execution of the code. Keep pressing F11 and watch where it takes you. Note too, that you can also hover your mouse over variables to see what value they hold at that time. It's a very powerful tool to finding why results are not coming out as expected.
It worked !!! :D but I'd like to keep the, 'And' opperator in the select statement if I can or if I can add it to the if statement because it feels like a good option in the code to use, any suggestions?. I would like to thank you so much because you are really informative on VB, you are very clear on what you are suggestion, asking etc. I feel a lot better about my deadline for this program. 
Well, if the client and server are both hosted on the same computer, there shouldn't be any problems with using ClickOnce right?
Link doesn't work
HI. I did but everything I found was lotus script exclusively. I had to put the issue aside for a while due to time constrains but If I find a solution I will make sure to let you know.
On a side note, in this line you likely wanted to use AND, not OR: If IsNumeric(txtProject1.Text) Or IsNumeric(txtProject2.Text) Or IsNumeric(txtProject3.Text) Or IsNumeric(txtProject4.Text) Then For your message it should look something like this: If IsNumeric(txtProject1.Text) and IsNumeric(txtProject2.Text) and IsNumeric(txtProject3.Text) and IsNumeric(txtProject4.Text) Then 'your code else msgbox("At least one value not numeric") exit sub end if 
Or you can just get VS 2015 Express, which arguably has more value and functionality than the full version of VB 2005.

Why download through a third party website when [Microsoft already has a website](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) dedicated to distributing Visual Studio?
These third party are providing offline installer that is ISO file once you download then start the installation.
.NET was very controversial back in the day. * It required a 20MB runtime - much larger than the VB6 runtime. Many people still possessed dial-up. And how to include the .Net framework along with your setup file? * VB syntax had become more verbose. Applications now contained more code than ever. The guts were no longer as hidden from the developer. Sure, there was the Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace, but it was presented as being a crutch. A new library needed to be learned... * Other things were more difficult. No more Winsock control? You mean I have to code this by hand? ADODC data controls are now bad? What are these disconnected datasets and CommandBuilder things? And to print out a form...it's no longer one line of code? Anyways, .NET, of course was an improvement over old VB6. Happy birthday indeed.

To modify this code to look for MDB files change the LTR in the above code to MDB. The getExstensionName method is identifying files with a specific extension. The properties of the oFile object contain the [DateCreated Property](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ke6a7czx.aspx), the Fullename is the ofile.text value, and the LastWriteTime is either [DateLastAccessed Property](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6zc3f20t.aspx) or the [DateLastModified Property](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c8xh895w.aspx) depending upon if you want if they just touched the file or actually made changes.

Are you required to use a textbox? I ask because I understand that many courses use examples to create scenarios that would never happen in the real world, but you are required to follow the bad example to pass. In the real world, you'd almost never allow date entry via a textBox. You used a DateTimePicker instead, and use it's .Value or .Date property in code (I honestly don't remember which it is, and don't have VS on this machine). 
Yeah a textbox for user entry and output results to messagebox is part of the requirements. I'll keep those real world applications in mind, thanks. 
I'll check when I get home, however I don't believe we have covered that material yet. My prof is the type that would complain if I went ahead. Thanks though. 
I think that you need to change the `&lt;&gt;` to `=`, because you're displaying the text when there's a `.` in the array. Dim chararray as String = "Hello." For i as Integer = 0 to chararray.length - 1 Step 1 If chararray(i) = "." Then ' The current character is a . Label1.text = "whatever" Exit For ' so that it can stop looping after the first match End if Next 
I don't know if that ended up helping you, but here's another neat tip that'll sparkle your prof's eyes: Instead of using all those message boxes for errors (which only compound a user's frustration), just put a text label directly under the text box where the date goes. Call the label "actionStatus" or "errorLabel" and set its text color to red and its text to "". Then whenever you would use a messagebox for an error, just set errorLabel.text = "Enter valid date: mm/dd/yy". Then when they do it right, set ErrorLabel.text = nothing.
What do you mean by 'without using methods'? If you want the code to be triggered as the user types the text, maybe look into the [TextChanged](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.control.textchanged(v=vs.110\).aspx?cs-save-lang=1&amp;cs-lang=vb#code-snippet-1) event of the TextBox. 
The easiest way to share an object between forms is to declare a form-level property, in FormA, as Friend or Public, and use that property whenever you want to transfer stuff between forms. So it would look a little like: Public Class FormA Friend Property CurrentPatient as clsPatient Public Sub ButtonFormClick() 'sub that's called when the button that opens FormB is clicked Dim px as New clsPatient CurrentPatient = px End Sub End Class Public Class FormB Public Sub Blargh 'accessing the property in FormA Dim patient as clsPatient patient = FormA.CurrentPatient End Sub End Class
Unfortunately using a messagebox to display outputs/errors is a required part of the assignment. I'll keep that in mind going forward though. Thanks. 
If you have both If's it works. I just tried it now. Is that not an option? Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click If RichTextBox1.Text.Contains("test") Then RichTextBox1.Text = RichTextBox1.Text.Replace("test", "work") End If If RichTextBox1.Text.Contains("target") Then RichTextBox1.Text = RichTextBox1.Text.Replace("target", "works") End If End Sub
Is it necessary to use the .Contains? Just seems somewhat redundant with the Replace. Perhaps I'm not understanding that. I just used this and it worked fine: Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click rtbReplace(".name", "[name]") rtbReplace(".target", "[target]") End Sub Private Sub rtbReplace(OldValue As String, NewValue As String) Dim NewText As String = RichTextBox1.Text NewText = NewText.Replace(OldValue, NewValue) RichTextBox1.Text = NewText End Sub Figured a reusable Sub() would cut back on the redundant code. Also, is the casing the same? .name &lt;&gt; .Name
Case-Insensitive option: Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click rtbReplace(".Name", "[name]") rtbReplace(".target", "[target]") End Sub Private Sub rtbReplace(OldValue As String, NewValue As String) RichTextBox1.Text = Replace(RichTextBox1.Text, OldValue, NewValue, 1, -1, CompareMethod.Text) End Sub

&gt; add a module, and create px there (give it a better name though), and then you can access it from anywhere Yep, I think this is the route I'm gonna go. Thank you!
This is how I'm doing it at the moment, however the properties I'm sharing are things like the Patient Name, Birthdate, etc. That's why I wanted to share the Patient class itself so that I wouldn't have to share the Patient details one by one.
? In my example, I'm sharing the patient object, not the patient details.
reload from file Me.PicturBox1.Image = Image.FromFile("C:\foobar.gif") or store the picture in a bitmap variable Dim myImage as new system.Drawing.Bitmap("myPath\myimage.gif") Me.PictureBox1.image = myImage 
While this is maybe a good starting point for a beginner, it is horrible code sorry... please don't do Subs like that. Better would be for instance a sub like this: Private Sub Replace_Text_In_RTB(byRef RTB as RichTextBox, TextToReplace as String, NewText as String) try RTB.Text = RTB.Text.Replace(TextToReplace,NewText) catch ex as exception 'do error handling end try End Sub 
So far I got: int difficulty; Console.WriteLine("Difficulty(1-3)"); int.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out difficulty); difficulty replaces IN1, since I like speaking variables. difficulty--; Now I'm not sure what the AND means, is it just +? or &amp;? What does specifically If (IN1 AND 1) = 1 Then Array(1) = Array(1) XOR 8 Array(4) = Array(4) XOR 4 End If mean? I understand that you modify the value of an array, but the operators AND and XOR seem to have different meanings, depending where you look. 
Read the error..... You're trying to read a string of "" into a decimal which it is unable to convert. I cant say I've ever really worked with decimals so you might want to wait for another response... However, my suggestion would be to add a form of validation at the start. If (textbox1.text = Nothing) Then MessageBox.Show("Please enter value") Exit Sub End If Or If (textbox1.text = Nothing) Then MessageBox.Show("Please enter value") : Exit Sub 
Nice one.. you might want to sort out the wording on your final message box "ERROR: Please Enter dont insert a negative number" 
* And &amp; * Or | * AndAlso &amp;&amp; * OrElse || * Xor ^ * Not ! * : ; (only used when multiple statements are on one line) 
Thank you very much :)
No. I will not help with something like this to easy to abuse.
You can set it up similarly to this: Public Class Form1 Private Sub TextBox1_KeyDown(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs) Handles TextBox1.KeyDown If e.KeyCode &lt; 48 Or e.KeyCode &gt; 57 Then e.SuppressKeyPress = True End Sub End Class
Thanks guys! your code worked 
If you run into anything else weird, feel free to ping me.
quick question, on debugging the application, the code you sent it doesn't allow me to backspace the number inputted.. any idea as to how I can resolve that?
You have to do it after creating the file so in the save sub after newC.Close() and yes as written in the documentation here https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms127963.aspx the first argument is the original file and the second one where you want to save the copy.
Interesting. I saw some VB.NET code the other day where it appears someone declared a variable as an interface. I don't know if the "New" keyword was used but it was a declaration. Is that a proper practice?
This is a good explanation. It's explained that the Interface is just to define a set of rules for objects to follow. Sets common parameters and leaves the implementation to the specific class.
I see. That makes sense. 
I'm trying to use your methodology also. I got everything basically the exact same (different variables that are declared) but for some reason it only displays the "your guess is too high by 80" any ideas?
Code expired. You should set it to never expire. You'd might have to make a new one though.
What do you mean?

This probably will be used to create a spam / fake news system for facebook. Given that this is targeted at VBA which is an automation language it gives more weight to the intent of automating posts. I will not support this for it is to easy to abuse, and given the lack of other posts from the other regulars I can assert that they feel similarly or don't want to be involved.
gotcha
It's probably just naming the DLL alias incorrectly, but whatever you're doing would most likely be far easier/simpler approached with .NET from the beginning. Even though it's possible to mix VBA/.NET together, it's still far simpler to stick with .NET from the outset.
So in other words you have no experience and want us to do it for you? Have you tried researching or even looking at the API on MSDN?
hmm. well, if works on your win 10 machines i would suspect the remote environment. can i ask, are you just sending an .exe to them? they may not have required dependencies installed/registered. Probably a very bad idea (depending how secretive you need your code to be), but are you able to send them the source and get them to step thru (F8) til error is encountered? i know that sounds like a bad idea, but it would probably be very much quicker. otherwise get their application and system logs from event viewer. 
I sent them an EXE with a ZIP of all dependencies (FTDI VCP driver, NI-VISA, etc). I used the same driver installers on the first win 10 machine for a full offline installation to check them, so I'm reasonably confident in those. Sending them the source is a good idea (nothing secret in there, just a few swear words in the comments), assuming they can get VS through the Great Firewall of China. I added a verbose option to the program's error logging to give heftier log file output and wrote a mini-utility in VB whose only job is to connect to and talk with the PLC. I wouldn't be surprised if that works but the full code does not. If it doesn't work then I can more certainly suspect the remote setup. ~~Thinking about it - any idea how VB handles multithreading on single core processors? There's a nonzero chance the computer they got is single core, and I used a background thread to listen for serial strings from the PLC (triggered by the user pressing a mechanical "start" button, not responses to queries from the computer)~~ *edit: they have a dual core* I'll have to look into Event Viewer, that's new to me. Looks useful! I'm not a programmer by training so I have plenty to learn about all the options and common methods out there. Thanks for the ideas, I appreciate it. 
When you say your error reporting is one level up, does that mean you don't know what the return value of this function is? Looks like in all your exception handlers, you return ex.message from this function, so can you not look at that to see what is failing here? Another question is are you allowing them to configure the COM port to open on their machine. It isn't hard coded as COM1 or something right? 
The next level up only calculates a boolean based on the content of the returned string. The original error handling would detect if the returned value included either the expected response or "EX", not a full-on parsing of the output. I just got some feedback from them, though, and I'm getting a timeout from ReadLine() in this function. Right, it's not hardcoded as COM1/other - the calling function gets all available COM ports via SerialPort.GetPortNames, then tries this CheckPort function on each one (so I'm expecting to get timeouts on any COM port that is not the correct one). In this particular system this is the only COM device that it connects to, but I wrote something last year that can connect to multiple COM ports using a slightly more rudimentary version of this function. They successfully interact with the PLC via Putty, and via a very small utility I wrote this afternoon that duplicates all basic port settings used in the test system, except the different settings are manual (text box entry for COM port, serial command, and read/write timeouts)
Cool, this is totally feasible. 1. What are some examples of the URLs you're trying to access? 2. What information from said URLs are you trying to extract?
I was thinking about that and now that you brought that up I plan on using the feature not to load any pictures or things like that to speed it up. Like maybe only loading the url's source code would speed this up cause all I really need is the numbers and they are in the code when I open the developers options.
Oh of course, there's a couple of functions that I normally use to attack a problem like this myself: Option Explicit Public Function GetXML(ByVal URL As String) As String On Error Resume Next With CreateObject("MSXML2.XMLHTTP") .Open "GET", URL, False .Send GetXML = .ResponseText End With End Function Public Function GetHTML(ByVal URL As String) As String On Error GoTo ErrorEscape Dim IE As Object: Set IE = CreateObject("InternetExplorer.Application") Dim HTML As Object IE.navigate URL Do Until IE.ReadyState = 4: DoEvents: Loop Do While IE.Busy: DoEvents: Loop Set HTML = IE.Document.Body GetHTML = HTML.innerHTML IE.Quit Set IE = Nothing Set HTML = Nothing Exit Function ErrorEscape: Set IE = Nothing Set HTML = Nothing End Function Generally I'd use the `GetXML()` function if raw source code is all that's needed. Usually for dynamic websites though, you need to allow for things like javascript to be processed since they alter the page, and can pull information from elsewhere or format it for display. So I'd use the `GetHTML()` function to retrieve the source code after javascript has finished processing.
Have a look at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.office.interop.excel.workbooks.open.aspx you can change the version you're looking at at the top. It's what I used to brute force an office 2016 excel password. Although I used python as thats the programming language i know.
Never mind, I ended up figuring it out. I feel dumb, but I would like someone here running Windows 7 test it to see if it works. I'll be setting up Windows 8 and 8.1 virtual machines possibly tomorrow to further test compatibility. I installed MonoGame to see what it's all about and I guess after playing around with it I found it has the XNA libraries I've been looking for in it so installing MonoGame and referencing the framework DLL in my app I'm able to capture input. Just import: Microsoft.Xna.Framework Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input And the best part is that it's pretty much the same syntax as XNA. When building your project there will be 20Mb of unnecessary crap in your build folder because it still thinks you're trying to build a video game so delete everything besides: MonoGame.Framework.DLL SharpDX.XInput.DLL And of course your executable Don't keep any of the XML files, they are also unnecessary. With further inspection I noticed that SharpDX is its own individual wrapper of the DirectX API and has a free SDK available that supports .NET 4.5 and up. MonoGame might just be completely unneeded, just the SharpDX SDK, I'll do some further testing. Hope this helps someone! P.S. If this doesn't work then look up MXA on Github, choose your VS version, and follow the install instructions. Install this along side of MonoGame. All it is is XNA Game Studio 4.0 (I believe 4.0 Refresh) and add-ons for Visual Studio. P.S.S. Didn't mean to call MonoGame stupid, I sowie. :D Update: SharpDX SDK can be used individually but can be a bit more complicated. Almost seems like MonoGame input was built around SharpDX seeing how MG simplifies the syntax and includes the SharpDX DLL in your final build. There are more options out there other than MonoGame but this is the most simplistic. If your looking to reduce file size just use the SharpDX SDK and reference the API. That or directly call from DirectX. You might need to download the DirectX SDK (if still available). I had done both and they work just fine.
Couldn't be further off. I'm a one man show in Phoenix selling TVs by myself. I decided it would be a good idea to learn how python works to help automate my Craiglist ad posting. Done. Now I wanna build a GUI for it so it's easier for me to learn/ if I ever get big enough to hire an employee.
If you want to show the pictures, you should do something like this: create a new form, let's call it ResultBox, place 3 picturebox on them. create a new sub on the form that takes 3 arguments. something like Public Sub InitializeForm(ByVal cmdRoule1 As Image, ByVal cmdRoule2 As Image, ByVal cmdRoule3 As Image) Make this form to load the cmdRoule1, 2 and 3 into the PictureBox you have placed on the new form, and add at the end of this sub Me.Show() Now, you can call your new form from the original with something like Dim results As New ResultBox() results.InitializeForm(picBoule1.Image, picBoule2.Image, picBoule3.Image) and then your form will show up, with the 3 images you specified. if you want only to show the values of cmdRoule1, 2, 3 (as I see, they are Integers), you can just do this: MsgBox("Results: " &amp; cmdRoule1 &amp; ", " &amp; cmdRoule2 &amp; ", " &amp; cmdRoule3, vbOkOnly + vbInformation)

This should leave the additional TableAdapter queries (the additional methods) that were added after initial configuration. &gt;Of course the additional methods will also need to be reconfigured if they reference a column that has been removed from the table on the database, or if any of the column definitions change (for example, if the data type is changed or modified). So if an aditional column was added to the table and it allows Null values the existing methods should still work - just depends on the scope of change to the schema of the table in the database. Short answer: your TableAdapter defines SQL that handles various operations like SELECT. You probably just have to add the new column(s) to the SQL.
 Array.Clear(chartDataBank, 0, chartDataBank.Length) Is that supposed to be in both sets of code? It also appears in the `chartDataCash` section.

[Saving text to file 101](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hxwfzt61.aspx) The CSV file format separates each cell by a comma. Each row of data is simply a new line of values stored in the file.
CSVs are nice and easy. Look into writing to a text file https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hxwfzt61.aspx To make a csv work just insert a comma between the values you are writing to the file. In the example above it writes file.WriteLine("Here is the first string.") instead wrtie file.WriteLine("Here,is,the,first,string.") and everthing will be in a seperate cell.
Ya. It would be nice if it did.

The [File](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.file\(v=vs.110\).aspx) class is better for interacting with files, as it contains static methods for reading (ReadAllText/ReadAllLines), creating and writing (WriteAllText/WriteAllLines), or appending (AppendAllText/AppendAllLines). This way you don't have to create and manage StreamWriter/Reader objects, and also cuts down on code, as File.xxx does in one line what a Streamxxxx does in 3-5.
contests like this usually have a theme that you need to stick to. if not, you should research past winners and why they won for some idea of how high the bar really is and what might be considered a "winner".

I'll ask her about information of the comptetion and last year's winners 
no, ask the ministry of education... 
This post was removed because it's obvious homework begging.
Though not for a competition, I have previously made a program in VB.NET with a decent amount of self-contained utilities, which included forms for a Date calculator (Difference between two dates), Temperature converter, Factor finder, Random number generator, a Stopwatch utility and a number of others... However, and as previous posters have said, you should definitely research the competition and get an idea of the types of applications that have previously won. And attributes like: * Purpose/Functionality (Is the program used to solve a problem? What problem does it solve?) * Category (Productivity, Game, Utility, Visualisation etc.) * Design/Appearance * Interactivity * Type of application (Taskbar/Window based/Console/Class Library etc.)

You're calculating the percentages before adding up the sums, this won't give you an accurate answer.
Just make sure the item does not not contain "DBNull.Value". For your names concatenation it would work with .ToString() because the method return a empty string ("") for this.
This will return the String.Empty. 
Cool! Thanks :)
Why is your code VB if it is a C# assignment?
&gt; When I use VB I choose C# I am not sure what this means. VB and C# are two completely different programming languages that only have the target .NET framework in common. You either code a project in VB or you code it in C#.
When I open up Visual Studio 2015 and choose new project I choose the preset of VB but my teacher explains it as C#. It also says Basic-C#.
What says Basic-C#? The class? As in it is an intro class to C#? If your class is a C# class and you hand in VB code, I don't know what your teacher is going to think. The two languages have vastly different syntax, the code does not look the same.
Didn't change it. If I look at cbCategory.Text after its change it returns 50 but the checkbox still has the top value selected.
I'm an idiot, I just checked and it says VB my bad
sorry combobox basically I'm creating a edit form and have comboboxs for a category which the category is already set. I've the value its set to and I have the combobox populated I'm just trying to get the combobox to goto the value already set.
&gt;What is your job description? Senior developer. Note that I'm not strictly a VB dev, there's also some C#, Javascript and SQL... &gt;What do you like about your job? There's constantly new challenges to solve; very little routine in this job. &gt;What don't you like about your job? Not much. Crystal Reports? Maintaining legacy systems can be somewhat boring since you generally have to use old technologies and somewhat conform to the architecture already in place, even if it's not very good or badly documented. &gt;What kind of problems do you have to find solutions for most often? It's very varied, but a few patterns emerge: presenting data as useful information to users, and simplifying processes down to the bare essentials (ie, giving users the results they need; not implementing the method they use to get it manually...) &gt;How do you solve problems? I try to implement a working minimum, faking data and missing parts if needed and then build on that to the final solution. Before that, there is analysis and design (gotta know where you want to end up before you go), but I try to get something concrete ASAP. Often, new requirements will appear once users can see something 'real". &gt;What led you to learn and use Visual Basic? When VB came out in 1991 (I think...) it was the simplest way to get CRUD Line-of-Business Windows app done. My employer at the time used it so I learned it. Eventually Delphi came along and was even better, but by that time VB had the numbers and still had Microsoft's backing; whereas ~~Borland~~ ~~Inprise~~ Embarcadero's vision for Delphi can probably best be summarized as "wut?" &gt;Are you at all concerned about the longevity and viability of the Visual Basic language? If so, why? Not really. Modern VB is more about learning the .Net framework than the language itself. About 98% of it maps directly to C#, so if VB disappeared tomorrow, all the .Net knowledge is still applicable. &gt;Thanks in advance for reading and responding! No problem.
You'll need to store the index of the correct answers in an array of integers, like so: Dim answers as Integer() = {2, 0, 1} Then, when you iterate through your questions, check to see if the index of the selected answer matches the one in answers(). If so, the answer is correct.
 If (ActiveSheet.AutoFilterMode And ActiveSheet.FilterMode) Or ActiveSheet.FilterMode Then ActiveSheet.ShowAllData
&gt;What is your job description? Create, maintain/support/improve company programs. Basically, DevOps. &gt;What do you like about your job? Programming. Creativity aspect, building programs, it's something different every day. Always learning. &gt;What don't you like about your job? Application support can interfere with development. No flexibility in implementing different technologies/languages; red tape. &gt;What kind of problems do you have to find solutions for most often? Identifying user error + areas for efficiency improvement. &gt;How do you solve problems? Google + stackoverflow &gt;What led you to learn and use Visual Basic? The need to automate redundant tasks. Many companies use .NET &gt;Are you at all concerned about the longevity and viability of the Visual Basic language? If so, why? No, Microsoft supports it. If you know .NET you know c#. Edit: additional comment
Ok nevermind, i don't understand. I tried to put as many comments in here about what i was thinking and make it easy to follow my project variables and what not... lol. Thank you for the help. Edit: Readability. If i have a datatable where: Dim dtbtest As New DataTable //This is just to show you what it's called Question | Answer1 | Answer2 | Answer3 | Answer4 | CorrectAnswer| |-Data---|--Data --|-- Data---|--Data ---|--Data ---|--- Data ---------| //Plus unknown amount of rows Dim i As Integer Dim questions(2, 5) As String //I know the variable might not be questions, but i would have to name it after the datatable? since that is where the info is coming from? also, in the (2,5) part, since the questions are coming from my database, where my datatable is derived from and "test" may not have a set amount of questions i would need to replace the 2 with i? Dim answers(3) As String //Same as statement above Dim quesNum As Integer //This is to keep track of question number that the user is on. lb_question.text = ? //Where i would need to output the question column of the datatable for the user to read. lb = label 'RB_Ans1.Text = ? //There are 4 of these for each answer that the user may pick. RB = Radio Button 'RB_Ans2.Text = ? 'RB_Ans3.Text = ? 'RB_Ans4.Text = ? questions = new string(,) {{"How many colors are in a rainbow?", "Answer1", "Answer2", "Answer3", "Answer4", "CorrectAnswer"}} //This is for however many questions there are in the testbank in the database. 
Must you use a DataTable and arrays? Seems unnecessary to me: you should be able to do everything with either 2d-arrays or datatables, no need for both. So say your questions and answers are all stored in dtbtest. If so, you can do this: For each row as DataRow in dtbtest.Rows Dim question as string = row("Question") Dim answers as String() For n = 0 to 3 answers(n) = row("Answer" &amp; n+1) Next Dim correctAnswer as String = row("CorrectAnswer") 'now you have everything you need stored in the variables 'question, answers(), and correctAnswer. Just iterate 'through answers() to populate your radioboxes. Next
Very interesting project. From what I see, you're using output of "netsh wlan show networks mode=bssid" and that's why it works only with English systems. You may consider using either native Windows API, or a [wrapper](http://managedwifi.codeplex.com) - it should give you required info independent from the console output. You don't need to include *.vshost.exe.config file in your release; it's needed only when debugging in VS. If you're willing to share your source code officially (I just peeked at the decompiled version), you will probably get more feedback.

Ok I figured this out. I had a SelectedValue bound to a datafeild in the properties. Worked after I unbound everything. Thanks for the help.
Why not just store the data in CSV format like so: player1name,player2name,player3name,player4name,player5name Then when you want to extract the data, you can use the following: PlayerName = Split("player1name,player2name,player3name,player4name,player5name",",") msgbox PlayerName(3) This would output `player4name`
&gt; no, the player#name are variables. it's about the values, i need those. Oh, are you including this like a VBScript plugin?
I may be completely wrong, having only just woken up and not being in a stable mind.. but is your query throwing any exceptions?.. the query seems to be compiled wrong.. "select * from table where order_number = '"" &amp; ordNo.text &amp;'"' " so on so forth.. your code seems fine to me, it just seems like the query would throw an exception.
You have essentially created a perfectly legal "INI" file, with some garbage entries. Using standard INI Read/Write functions, you can retrieve the values: player1= "player1name" player2= "player2name" player3= "player3name" player4= "player4name" player5= "player5name"
 This may work: call Include("thetextfile.txt") Sub Include (externScrpt) Dim tmpFile, tmpFso Set tmpFile = tmpFso.OpenTextFile(externScrpt) ExecuteGlobal tmpFile.ReadAll() tmpFile.Close End Sub
You need a DataSet consisting of two tables related to each other. The master Orders table is related to the Order Details table. Google master detail relationship using datasets.

`t2 = t1 + Q / (m * C * v)` I am unfamiliar with what each item in the equation means, but it would probably be easier to format everything all in a single line of code like above.
Are you sure you're getting your equations correct?
I'm sure of it, I'm starting to give up. I can't manage to work this.
vague. but Anchor would be my go to. if you want to get intricate, each object on the form has it's own LOCATION propeties. these can be set on the forms RESIZE event It gets tricky trying to adjust for different resolutions. ... so like html.. you might have to use % of screen. but you first need to work out size of screen.. two of above by other commenters already. 
Use the Container Controls to help with this. Add a TableLayoutPanel to the form. Add enough rows and columns to the TableLayoutPanel it to contain the number of buttons you have (use the flyout on the top right corner). Set the width and height of each column to whatever you need them to be. A percentage of the forms size is probably what you are looking for ... just set them all to 50% (or the same percentage) and they'll reset themselves appropriately, but set them after you've added all that you need. Move all of the buttons into the cells in the TableLayoutPanel (one button per cell), and set their anchor or dock properties (fill dock will be faster than anchoring). Then dock or anchor the TableLayoutPanel to the form, and everything will follow and resize automatically. 
ahem.. whats that 
WPF is Windows Presentation Foundation. Where WinForms was designed for much older Windows versions (though it's still a very solid framework), WPF was designed around creating a much more modern UI* From [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2493402/dynamically-scaled-uis-with-vb-net-winforms) &gt;...this is one place where WPF has a huge advantage over Windows Forms. In WPF, all sizing and layout is done with a "pixel" being a virtualized, resolution indepdent "pixel" which corresponds to 1/96th inch. This means your UI will just work on any resolution, provided you don't explicitly mess it up. See [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms752299\(v=vs.110\).aspx) for the MSDN Hello World example. 
It really depends a lot on what "MyObject" looks like. If it's truly just a string with some convenience methods, then writing/reading line by line ain't a bad option. If the string values have line breaks in then, they'll need to be escaped. The _easiest_ way to do that would be to find a NuGet package with CSV support. (I can recommend one of you like) Next, would be to use Newtonsoft JSON 
&gt; Agree completely with u/EveryoneLikesMe .... skip Access and just start with SQL. I can't. Most of our data are stored in access so i need to be adept in Access first before moving to SQL but great suggestions. I will plot this so i know the step by step learning process.
Hi! Thank you for your suggestion but i can't. Most of our data are using MS Access so i can't really skip it.
&gt; The list is populated with 6500 names and positions from a database. I need to save it and reload it when the program starts again. The point being to save on grabbing the whole thing from the database over and over. Wait... Can you explain further what you are trying to achive? It really sounds like you are going in a wrong direction if you save data to the HDD to save lookup time in a Database. 
Thank you. I did what you said, and now I'm getting this error: "Must declare the scalar variable: "@id". Hm. 
Ok, in your original code you had this on line 16: sqlcmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@qid", qid) The @qid it what should be referenced in your WHERE line like this: WHERE question.id = @qid" Please note how there are no single-quotes around @qid 
I have been where you are at and I rolled my own custom control based upon this article. https://www.codeproject.com/articles/15559/a-windows-forms-based-text-editor-with-html-output You could also extend the richtext control https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/15585/Building-a-Simple-Word-Processor-Around-an-Extende

I figured out a way to do it now!
Have you checked the [HTML Agility pack](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31528980/using-htmlagilitypack-in-vb-net-to-get-text-from-a-website)? It is a great helper for html related stuff https://htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/
I already used this is a little game I made. It works perfectly. 
You have name and gender declared in the load, but that doesn't declare it in the button1.click. You could declare them either right after the first line of code, the public class form2 procedure, or you could declare them inside the button1_click procedure before the try statement. Best practice would be to declare them inside the button1_click procedure unless you need to access the data outside that procedure. Also, using Name as a variable is probably not a good idea as it is a reserved word, use student_name and student_gender or something like that. 
What you need is the NUGET-Package Manager in VisualStudio to install the HTMLAgilityPack. And here a quick example how you can find a specific html element. In this case we are looking for all elements of the type table which contain a static text ('Resource' or 'Role') and also have a attribute named 'class' with the value 'racitable' i hope this helps Public Sub Main() doc = New HtmlAgilityPack.HtmlDocument doc.LoadHtml(YOURHTML_String) Try htmElements = doc.DocumentNode.Descendants("table").Where( _ Function(d) (d.InnerText.Contains("Resource") Or d.InnerText.Contains("Role")) _ AndAlso d.Attributes.Contains("class") _ AndAlso d.Attributes("class").Value.ToLower = "racitable").ToList Catch ex As Exception 'err handling End Try End Sub
Very helpful thankyou
Thanks, this worked perfectly
I think you should create a periodic table application. Have a picture of the [periodic table of the elements](http://academic.greensboroday.org/~regesterj/potl/Matter/StatesOfMatter/periodic-table.GIF), and when a user clicks on an element, it opens a new form with more information about that element. You would just have to use the onMouseUp method of the picture of the table, take the X and Y of where the user clicked and use that to identify the element they clicked on. Then maybe call the computer to open the browser with the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen) for that element. Dim elementName as String = "Hydrogen" ' or whatever Dim webAddress As String = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/" &amp; elementName Process.Start(webAddress) Alternatively, it would be much less work to use a picture of the [solar system](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/18/dc/fa/18dcfa0517fdf2624ea40bbaa8264ffb.jpg), and pop up the Wikipedia page for each planet when clicked. 
http://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-Percentages#Calculating_the_Percentage_of_a_Whole_sub
&gt;(games Won + games lost) diveded by games won and its still not correct. That is not how you calculate the percentage of games won.
The outcome was, I did a full install. The install failed again. And now even more of the project templates are missing. The only thing that shows up now is Visual C++. I'm not sure what to do. Maybe I can find an old installer and revert back to 2015. This sucks.
Not enough people in this sub to justify it I'd imagine. Edit: MS has been trying to quietly kill off VB for over a decade. Which I'll never understand.
how many users in this sub?
Do you guys _really_ want one? What are we going to do in there: swap clever method names and make punny variables?
Ty for the reply. I made some changes and the answer im getting seems to be in line with the question but the answer is still incorrect everytime Public Class FrmTest Dim No1 As Integer = 0 Dim No2 As Integer = 0 Dim Answer As Integer = 0 Dim UAnswer As Integer = 0 Dim Count As Integer = 0 Dim Score As Integer = 0 Private Sub btnStart_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnStart.Click txtAnsewr.Text = 0 UAnswer = txtAnsewr.Text Score = 0 btnNext.Visible = True 'Randomizing numbers Randomize() No1 = CInt(Int((12 * Rnd()) + 1)) No2 = CInt(Int((12 * Rnd()) + 1)) txtQuestion.Text = No1 &amp; " X " &amp; No2 Answer = (No1 * No2) End Sub Private Sub btnNext_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnNext.Click txtAnsewr.Text = 0 UAnswer = txtAnsewr.Text Answer = No1 * No2 If Answer = UAnswer Then MessageBox.Show("Congratulations, that was the correct answer") Score = Score + 1 Else MessageBox.Show("That answer was incorrect, the correct answer is " &amp; Answer) End If 'Randomizing numbers Randomize() No1 = CInt(Int((12 * Rnd()) + 1)) No2 = CInt(Int((12 * Rnd()) + 1)) txtQuestion.Text = No1 &amp; " X " &amp; No2 txtQuestion.Refresh() 'Clearing and Counting txtAnsewr.Clear() txtAnsewr.Focus() Count = Count + 1 If Count &gt; 12 Then MessageBox.Show("The Test has finished, Click feedback to find out how well you ahve done") btnNext.Visible = False End If

ask your school. also ask why they are using 7 year out of date software that has a free upgrade option.
haha i am so stupid, ty for all the help
/r/chrwei the automoderator killed your post. I restored it.
There's no reason to run 2010 at home. You can open the projects in '13 or '15, and there's not enough differences to be worried about. 
I'm getting the issue where I always get the read back of "Your guess was too high by 80", no matter what the input is. I don't understand what the issue is. Any ideas? 
The easy, but not very good, solution is to change the font in the listBox to a fixed width font (courier or one of the others). This will make every letter or number take the exact same amount of space, and is how we solved this problem back in the DOS days when we didn't have grids. The correct fix is to use a grid control to display the data, so that you have each bit of data in a column (similar to a spread sheet). The DataGridView will do this for you. 
Hmm. So it doesn't! Must've been mistaken
Copy the selected radio button texts to the message box prompt. Use something like: Dim str As String str = "" ' Cycle through all controls on the form, and look just for Radio Buttons For Each ctl As Control In Me.Controls If TypeOf ctl Is RadioButton Then ' Only look at the ones that are checked, add its text to the string If DirectCast(ctl, RadioButton).Checked Then str = str &amp; ctl.Text &amp; vbCr End If End If Next MsgBox("Clicked " &amp; str) 
Worked great. thanks!
`Array.Max` should yield what you need.
what isn't clear from the documentation and example? also, for a default path you can use the USERPROFILE environment variable as your starting point, which probably will solve your original issue just as well.
After our little conversation via PM i made you a little something to get you started. The following example loads the page, extracts the table you want, loops through all rows and columns and shows the content in the debug window: Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click 'Define the URL Dim URL As String = "https://www.ohiolottery.com/WinningNumbers/KenoDrawings/KenoDrawingsArchive.aspx?date=03%2f01%2f2017" 'use a webclient to get the html of the page Dim webClient As New System.Net.WebClient 'save the html Dim result As String = webClient.DownloadString(URL) 'use html to init a html document Dim doc As New HtmlAgilityPack.HtmlDocument doc.LoadHtml(result) 'How do we recognize the table we want? 'We analyze the html and in our *current* case it is easy 'because the table has a unique class attribute named keno_drawings 'Get the table with all the numbers Dim MatchingElements As List(Of HtmlAgilityPack.HtmlNode) MatchingElements = doc.DocumentNode.Descendants("table").Where(Function(element) element.HasAttributes AndAlso element.Attributes.Contains("class") _ AndAlso element.Attributes("class").Value.ToLower = "keno_drawings").ToList 'Check if we didnt found the table If MatchingElements.Count = 0 Then MsgBox("Could not find Keno_Table") : Exit Sub 'Check if there are too much matching elements If MatchingElements.Count &gt; 1 Then MsgBox("More than 1 Resulttable") : Exit Sub 'Take the table from the list of MatchingElements Dim KenoTable As HtmlAgilityPack.HtmlNode = MatchingElements.First 'Loop through the table and show the content in debug window For Each row As HtmlNode In KenoTable.SelectNodes("//tr") For Each col As HtmlNode In row.SelectNodes("//td") 'first we skip all content which is not numeric If Not IsNumeric(col.InnerText) Then Continue For Debug.Print(col.InnerText) Next Next End Sub
Your error means that one of the variables in the statement is nothing. Either your textOutput (which is unlikely because its propably a control) or downCompiler (also unlikely because you can set the values earlier) or .StandardOutput (which is my guess). That means somehow your initialization is not correct or in other words you are trying to get data before the Downloader has it. 
Ah, I see. Any ways to change that? (The code above is pretty much the gist of the program...)
Correct usage of whatever class your downCompiler is ;) But i dont even know what it is so sadly i can't give you any hint
downCompiler is this: &gt; Dim downCompiler As New Process()
Oh yes,i see it now, so you are trying to start the youtube downloader and get the output? Try if this would work: downCompiler.Start() Dim output As String = downCompiler.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd() Console.WriteLine(output) Also, do you know if the downloader works correctly? I have never used it but i think changing the setting CreateNoWindow to false could give you an overview what it is doing 
UPDATE: I found the problem to the error, which is due to the quotation marks. So I fixed that. Thanks! However, the output still wouldn't go to the multi-line text box. It still gives a blank output... *** I tried as suggested (CreateNoWindow = false), and attempted the code above. The video downloads, but doesn't merge. UPDATE: The video downloads, merges, and stuff when I use it directly in CMD. However, output doesn't appear when in VB's form, even with CreateNoWindow = false (it' just blank XD)...
Ok this is awesome! But when I plugged this in I'm getting the same error =/ Im running w/e the lastest version of vb in the last couple of months and everything should be up to date. I don't know why the error is happening cause its not telling me what line it doesn't like. But this is just a update saying thank you and I'm going to keep working on it from here see what I can figure out and i'll get back to you sir. Again your awesome, I really apprecaite you adding comments in there to help break it down and letting me learn more! 
Yeah I can only imagine but also there was a lot less to learn I would think at the time so not as much knowledge being thrown around :) Ok got the link I'll read it after lunch with the wife and again probably best person I met so far man. *thumbs up*
What i want is to play 2 sound files one after the other, and while they are playing, to have a visual representation of the sound (by changing the PBM 1/2 image respectibly). By doing Refresh() imediatly after changing each image i solved my problem. Thank you
it'll be passed on the command line. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/eakb0th5(v=vs.100).aspx

Do you have test cases to run your program through?
[This is what I meant by test cases.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_case) I'm not sure why you need other people to test your own program for you.
 Dim counter As Integer For i = 2 To 10 counter = 0 For j = i To 2 Step -1 If i Mod j = 0 Then counter += 1 Next If counter = 1 Then Console.WriteLine(i) Next Edit: Here are a couple of other ways to do it.

Have you established upper and lower bounds for data input? Ensured all data types are accounted for so nothing is used incorrectly? Those would be the first places I'd look at to test for bugs.
I dont need it to be written, just one of the codes how i can do it. The i have that exact lay-out as in the picture but i just dont know the code and my teacher wont help me
I knew them, but thanks anyway :)
&gt;Thanks! Will have a look... So I had a look, and it's almost the same as what I intended, BUT instead of reading the output at the very end, is there a way to output the process's output stream live, as the youtube-dl runs?
How big is the code?
the program has about 15 forms, about 80 lines each
You're going to have to post the code somewhere and share a link. I don't think anybody is going to want to download an exe from a stranger on the internet. 
i can do it, but im a student and procrastinate way too much that there is no time .. i can send it but later, so message me to remind me please 
You should be able to upload it quickly and easily to GitHub. If this is too much work for you... good luck on the competition.
Lol, i will.. i was busy then studying and i couldnt upload, ill be uploading it on github and releasing a link in the main thread
i think that would be difficult due to the way youTube caches the video, the various quality options and the end users internet speed. You could read and output in specific block sizes from a filestream. A typical microsoft example vb code is here. **[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.filestream.read%28v=vs.110%29.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.filestream.read%28v=vs.110%29.aspx)** Then you'd need to shoehorn it into your app. 
There are 200 to 500 different DB's. :/ I'd like to run a query across all of them at once. There's nothing uniform about the directories either and new directories/DB's are added daily. 
/u/thudly /u/StickySnacks I dont know if this will tag you, but here is the link with the code and the program itself! https://github.com/YahiaTGF/Utility-Collection
"at once" in parallel or just in series? you could do a loop and reconnect the db object to each as you go concatenating results. 
Here are the steps in the order; 1. build the interface. Remember to use name that makes sense for the control. 1. write a function that takes 3 parameters SourceUnit, DestinationUnit, and SourceValue. Somthing like this Public function Convert(SourceUnit as string, DestUnit as string, Value as double) as double 1. using a decision process (if then, select case) check to see which formula you need to use. 1. Call the function passing it the paramters from the interface. 1. from the return of the function write the value back out to the interface via the control.text property. 
Thank you very much! :) 
tell me what i should do? someone suggested putting my code so people believe me
make a zip of the visual studio solution so we can download it. Then people will be able to open it in and run the debugger to step through your code.
Well I don't think it matters how they are queried. I'm more worried about how the data is returned. I guess it would help to explain what I'm trying to accomplish and perhaps you fine people can tell me if there's a better way than what I'm trying to do. Basically, our crm stores it's contact data for each account we have into separate dbf files. They file contains company, address, contact etc...as well as a plethora of custom fields. What I need to do is query one of those custom fields to search where field = x and return any contact record where that field contains x and then display those records in any order in a view table in the browser/app. Then I can take all of those records and copy/paste them into a spreadsheet to import those into another db.....that wouldn't be included as part of the original search. Unfortunately, the crm application we use does not have any way to query or filter across all of the databases that it houses. You can query each individual one, but I'm trying to avoid having to switch between each one in the application itself, build out the query and export the data. With 200 or so databases where field "could" contain x, that would take for freaking ever just to find those records :/ hope that makes sense. 
lol, i can do that but that would be giving away my work for free so someone takes it, smacks his name on it... i know its not something big but it took me lots of work 
Here you go: Dim ofd As New OpenFileDialog If ofd.ShowDialog = DialogResult.OK Then If ofd.FileName &lt;&gt; String.Empty Then Me.myPictureBox.Image = Bitmap.FromFile(ofd.FileName) End If End If From: https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/71892535-3491-4370-b767-dec04e8ee1be/how-to-load-an-image-into-picturebox?forum=vbgeneral
Ok thanks. I'm going to start building it out tomorrow. Would you mind if I pm'd you if I have questions about some of the syntax and whatnot? 
So, there are a couple of ways to do this. Do you want the full, detailed, complex solution that will make you rethink the way you program, or do you want the quick and dirty solution?
Ah, sorry. I got a cold and just saw "OpenFileDialog" and...
Thank you /u/Mr_C_Baxter. I will work on it tonight when I am done working for the day and see what I can do. This is a lot harder than I thought it would be, I picked VB because I thought it would be the easiest to learn by myself. I might just end up purchasing software that can do what I want it to. 
Question: Why are you keeping track of your minutes and seconds separately? Why not keep a single timer for seconds, and a single variable that increments with each second tick? Then you can do maths to display the number of minutes and seconds accordingly. This reduces the number of timers you need down to just 1, versus the 2 or 3 you currently are trying to juggle.
i have only one timer lol 
That is a bad excuse. Especially in today's age. Most people here can easily do what you did, do you honestly think we would steal your code?
I deleted it from my main program and will implement it to a test one soon, but as i recall the bug i had was the strt button getting disabled when i click on The stopalarm button.. Also sometimes the timer goes to negative numbers 
The complex way I was referring to was basically learning about classes, objects, and data-binding. You would setup a class to represent your 'auto service' objects, instantiate the objects into a list from some source info, and then databind the listbox to that list with the 'label' property of your objects as well as binding the .selected property of the listbox items with another property in your object. Then you would just iterate through the list and add anything where the 'isSelected' property is true. However, today is busier at work than I thought it would be, so it's going to take a while to write all of that up. The quick and dirty way: Iterate through the listbox's 'SelectedItems' collection property, and use a Case statement to determine the value to be added to the total: Private Function getTotal() Dim total As Integer = 0 For Each item As Object In ListBox1.SelectedItems Select Case item.ToString Case "Repair &amp; Replace Engine" total += 18 Case "Repair &amp; Replace Alternator" total += 15 End Select Next Return total End Function Add more Cases as needed.
I highly recommend using an actual numeric variable versus the text of labels to calculate the amount of time you're trying to keep track of. I'm relatively sure that's the source of all your issues. Here's a quick and dirty method of converting the number of seconds into a formatted string: Private Function TimeStampString(ByVal Seconds As Long) As String Dim TempTS As TimeSpan = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Seconds) TimeStampString = TempTS.ToString("hh\:mm\:ss") End Function Private Function TimeValue(ByVal Seconds As ULong) As String Dim Hours As Double, Minutes As Double If Seconds &gt; 3600 Then Hours = Math.Floor(Seconds / 3600) Seconds -= (Hours * 3600) End If If Seconds &gt; 60 Then Minutes = Math.Floor(Seconds / 60) Seconds -= (Minutes * 60) End If Return Right("00" &amp; CStr(Hours), 2) &amp; ":" &amp; Right("00" &amp; CStr(Minutes), 2) &amp; ":" &amp; Right("00" &amp; CStr(Seconds), 2) End Function --- Edit: Even more efficient function! Edit: Added old function back in.
Create a function to compute an hour:minute:second string, given the number of seconds left on the timer. Public Class Form1 Dim totalSeconds As Integer = 5463 Private Sub Timer1_Tick(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Timer1.Tick If totalSeconds &gt; 0 Then totalSeconds -= 1 TextBox1.Text = GetTimeString(totalSeconds) End Sub Private Function GetTimeString(totalSeconds As Integer) As String Dim seconds As Integer = totalSeconds Dim hours As Integer = seconds \ 3600 ' backslash does interger division, ignoring remainder If hours &gt; 0 Then seconds -= hours * 3600 ' 3600 seconds per hour, remove them, if any Dim minutes As Integer = seconds \ 60 If minutes &gt; 0 Then seconds -= minutes * 60 Dim timeString As String = hours &amp; ":" &amp; Format(minutes, "0#") &amp; ":" &amp; Format(seconds, "0#") Return timeString End Function End Class
If you can find the URL to your profile page, you might be able to parse it out of the HTML. That's about all I can tell you. 
You're welcome! If you want you could outline your Software a little for me, i will try my best to recommend you a good approach. I am sure you already know that a bought software is the fastest way, your own software on the other hand could be adapted to every change in your situation / business by yourself without money. Also please keep in mind learning programming is hard for everyone but it is also extremely rewarding if you managed to overcome the initial struggles. The possibilities are endless. Anyway, hit me up with questions if there are some. 
Hm... True true, added the old function back in!
Thanks! ill look through this and try to learn it
Thanks, ill look into it and learn it
nevermind I just had an s on items so it would not allow me to 
Haha it's fine
I'm pretty sure you need an accumulator to get the word study to show up how ever many times you want it to. Are you familiar with how accumulators work? 
&gt; Use &amp;= to append text TIL. I always used lblStudy.text = lblStudy.text &amp; ...
1. I highly recommend not ever trying to insert buttons all over a spreadsheet as you run into display problems when rows/columns are resized, copied, cut, and pasted all over the place. 2. Since you're only performing two different actions for each row, (2 buttons which I assume are meant to do different things) why not either have it detect which action to perform based on user data/input? Or you could tie it into 2 separate hotkey activated macros. 3. Don't use text boxes ON a spreadsheet to collect user-data. Just use the cells, they're already text boxes, and they're organized text boxes. You can even sort them and format their display settings if you need to get fancy. But don't overlay text boxes on top of them and hope for the best. If you're willing to follow these three suggestions, I'd be happy to help you out with coding something. But I won't touch control overlays on multiple cells with a 10 foot pole. It's just making things more complicated than they ever have to be.
Not sure at this point, but I was leaning toward more dynamic buttons admittedly. I want the assignments to be specific to the class/category they're in. How could I do that with only one assignment and remove class button?
Ok that sounds like a pretty concise direction to take. (Although is there a way to keep it all contained in one sheet for the sake of simplicity for the user?) But I'm not sure how you would go about assigning "Unique ID's" to anything. I haven't touched VBA since highschool. 
By all means ask away!
I remember running into this same problem with a thermal printer and my point of sale system. Pretty sure it has to do with the printer's settings. After messing with settings for days, I finally just worked around it by writing what I wanted to print as html and loading it into a webbrowser control. Then I called webbrowser.print . I was able to setup default margins, etc in internet explorer, which are shared by webbrowser. Might be helpful.
Yeah, only 3 wages total no matter what car or what job. Thanks /u/Mr_C_Baxter. I might have to give up on it, I think its way to complicated for me. Is there a way for me to zip the project that i have already done and you can look at the code I have already and it might be more helpful once you see it. I used the .tag code that you mentioned and got some of it to work but if I do it the way I am doing it it would take even a single programmer a long time.
I was able to get it to work via printer settings. It had a setting for 58mm x 3526mm; now as long as it isnt 3526mm long, it keeps printing.
Hey I got one for ya: I'm isolating all Class IDs to column A. And I'm trying to program the remove class button to delete all rows with the same name like this: ActiveSheet.Activate For Each deletiontarget In Intersect(Range("A1:A100"), ActiveSheet.UsedRange) v = deletiontarget.Value If InStr(v, "Course/Category 3") &gt; 0 Then Range(deletiontarget, deletiontarget.Offset(0, 8)).Delete End If Next deletiontarget Range("c2").Value = Range("c2").Value - 1 Later I'm just going to write in ActiveCell where "Course/Catergory 3" is so that the user can delete whatever class they choose, but im testing like this because it keeps deleting them in 2 or 3 instances instead of all of them. any insight?
When deleting rows, you have to work backwards, from the greatest row number to the least. Say you were deleting rows 1-4, if you start from row 1, you delete row 1, but row 2 moves up to replace it. When you go to delete row 2, it now contains the contents of row 3, skipping row 2.
so i should just reverse the range?
So, reverse the range?
Yes, you'd have to go from row 100 to 1.
Ok so i did that, and there's still some that aren't being deleted. :/
Oh, so later on i can create a C+ application (When i learn that language) and make it cross platform or is it just a click of a button to transfer them?
its more than a click of a button it is a design style. You do have to write your app towards the idea if cross platform builds. Yes you can write in C++ if you want. "C# and the .NET Framework, HTML and JavaScript, or C++." 
C# should be your next move as VB behaves more similarly to C# than C++. C++ could be a bit tricky for those who are beginners.
Thanks James! its me the guy from the mail :D
Thanks ill try it asap
To be honest, Visual Basic has practically nothing to do with BASIC other than sharing some keywords (`If ... Then ... Else` etc). Also, there are multiple variants of VB: - the original Visual Basic, the last version of which (6) was released in the nineties and is a mostly dead and officially unsupported language - Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), mostly identical to VB6 and still used in MS Office for writing macros - Visual Basic .NET, a modern language meant to replace VB6 and shares the general syntax, but uses a completely different runtime and library (.NET Framework) If you want to complement your MS Office work, VBA may be worth the consideration. However, I don't think your BASIC background will be a significant factor in learning any variant of Visual Basic, apart from having a basic understanding of loops and conditions etc. that would apply to any other imperative programming language as well. If you want to get into programming proper, I would recommend not getting hung up on the BASIC-Visual Basic connection and looking at other languages, since Visual Basic (in any incarnation) has kind of a bad reputation (deservedly or not) and may be more difficult to find up to date examples, support, projects and possibly jobs for.
Here's what happened the last time BASIC was brought up in this sub: [Having trouble converting \(supposedly\) basic to C#...](https://www.reddit.com/r/visualbasic/comments/5vpwwa/having_trouble_converting_supposedly_basic_to_c/) It's a rough conversion, but conveys the meaning of the code. There's a whole bunch of stuff that should also be in there (Variable declarations, etc) but it was an interesting look into the origins of VB. From never having seen BASIC before in my life, it was fascinating being able to look at it and recognize what was going on. (My background was VB6/VBA then VB.NET)
Yes i'm, Thanks again!
The fact that you're asking and enthusiastic about learning it means you will probably do well and find it interesting. So, go for it! To answer your question, forget BASIC and how much of that will help. Visual Basic is already a great learning language since it looks so much like pseudocode -- the plain english representation of an algorithm. It also has a huge online presence with a lot of tutorials. You will only be limited by how much you want to learn. You can download Visual Studio Community for free and tinker. It's today's version of the 80s Turbo Pascal that became free in the early 2000s. Have fun!
This isn't going to help so much in your situation where you have an existing project that you want to convert, but if you want to start from scratch and use VB to write Android applications, [this exists](https://www.b4x.com/).
that's what I thought going by the icons, but I know that the computer system still used something like Windows 2000 in the computing labs, so I wasn't too sure if the Windows 2000 theme simply made all the icons old-style
I've read that there is a resurgence of VB.Net recently so it's not entirely a bad language to learn. I still feel that a person is better off moving to other languages like C# though. As someone that, almost 20 years go, moved from old school basic to a modern language, I strongly suggest exploring C#. Once a person gets a grip on C# and .NET then they can transition back and forth to and from VB.Net without much issue. BTW: I'm not just talking out of my butt here. I work on legacy apps written in VB.Net and newer applications written in C# every day as part of my full time employment. Also, my first language beyond basic was c++ and I've never regretted it. C# wasn't around back then so it wasn't an option. 
Assume VB6. Still code in this editor often. I can't exactly remember when intellisense was introduced. It might have helped correct that line highlighted in red. 
Definitely the VB6, integrated editor instead of floating windows.
What do you mean by global function? In the old days we use to have a .BAS file that was basically a bunch of functions that could be called globally. For all I know that may still work but the correct way to do it is to create a class with your function in it. Instantiate a copy of the class and call the function from there. Module Module1 Sub Main() Dim newFunctionClass As New Functionclass Dim outputValue As Integer = newFunctionClass.AddTwoValues(2, 3) Console.WriteLine("2+3=" &amp; outputValue) Console.ReadKey() End Sub End Module Public Class Functionclass Public Function AddTwoValues(value1 As Integer, value2 As Integer) As Integer Return value1 + value2 End Function End Class 
Why would VB2015 be available in 2010/2011?
Vb5 or 6
If textbox1.text &lt; 0? It's pseudo code of course because you can't convert a string to an integer. You can put it under the text changed event for the text box once you modify it. Double clicking the text box in the designer will automatically add the event for you. Or you can do if textbox1.contains("-"), once again its pseudo code.
Well, you have the `intRowCountExcel` variable that contains the number of rows being exported from the DB. You'd check that in sub containing the first worksheet code. I'd also recommend compressing your data into a single sub, since you have nearly identical code repeated three times. You can create worksheet references for each worksheet all within the same subroutine.
Yeah, what he said. Make a sub that checks some kinda data to see if Now() is greater than the scheduled time, if it is, mark the data as done and fire off whatever needs to be done. If you want something recurring, you'll want to store the last time you fired it, and not fire it again till Now() &gt; LastFired + interval. Wire that sub to the timer and bingo. You'll have to keep the app running all the time, obviously.
VB6 and VB.net are quite different when you get used to them, you may find vb6 a smoother transition, though I would treat vb.net as a fresh new language, maybe learn c# first to make you see .net as alien technology, then look at vb.net to see which bits of the madness are .net and which bits are the language itself :)
Have a look at [Quartz.Net](https://www.quartz-scheduler.net/). Alternatively, you could just use the Windows task scheduler to run your app at the appropriate time.
The visual basic subreddit is mainly used by beginner programmers checkout /r/donnet or /r/programming they might be able to help better.
So, you could make yourself a console application and then set the Windows task scheduler to kick it off with a time based trigger. 
Tried this... Completely failed. I'm sure it's me, but for some reason it wouldn't work. Still don't know.
TY for the help I have a direction to head in at least now. Ill be sure to share my progress :D. 
Excel? No, you should use Access.
Seriously? There is so much info out there that a simple search would render many results. I may not seem helpful, but I just saved you time by steering you in the right direction.
Dictionary object definitely best way to go here if you aren't required to use arrays.
Im sorry if my question is dumb, im still new aat this.. how do i actually create an access file when the application starts up? and if it exists it ignore creating it 
If you are asking this question you need to take a step back. Excel is the wrong platform for this. A database is the correct platform. You could use Access, but I prefer SQLite it is a tiny file based database that will do everything you need.
Thanks for the reply! Im currently testing with Access because two other users suggested so, but since im really a begginner (first time dealing with databases) i dont even know how to make the program create an Access file when it launches and to check if it already exists, can you help with that? thanks in advance
There is no easy way to do this. I have always just included an empty access database maybe with the administrator account included in the data so that you can test with it. Then copied it to the exe directory during build process. This way you can skip the creation step.
Im giving the program to someone that i cant meet so ill have to let the program create it on C Drive and check each time, is there any way to do that at all?
Then including an empty access database with the tables you need is your best option.
You can drag drop the database from explorer into your solution and then set the properties to always copy to the build directory. Here is the file copied into the project http://i.imgur.com/5dNVVcA.png Here is the property http://i.imgur.com/6OFuhDk.png So when you compile the app it will put a copy into your bin folder with the application. If you are creating an installer just make sure that the daatbase is included int he installer project. 
Thanks very much! ill try this when i go home!
* If you want to show all the letters together in the textbox, they can go into one string like this: Dim s as string s= inputbox1.text &amp; inputbox2.text &amp; inputbox3.text textbox.text = s * Else, if you want them to show in the textbox every time you change the input in inputboxes, just raise an inputbox_textchanged event executing the following: Dim letter1 as string Dim letter2 as string Dim letter3 as string letter1 = inputbox1.text letter2 = inputbox2.text letter3 = inputbox3.text textbox.text = letter1 &amp; letter2 &amp; letter3 
Good luck drop a post if you need more help 
Again with the Excel? You do NOT want to use Excel to store data - you want to use a database. Access, MySQL, MSSQL Express, LocalDB, etc... Excel is a spreadsheet program, not a database program.
Using an access database for multiple machines on the same network can be done. You would place the database on a fileserver someplace and reference the database from that path. To make it easier to move I would store the connection string in the application.config file. This way you can easily move the location of the database. Please don't use ODBC for this use ADOX if you have to but not ODBC. https://www.tutorialspoint.com/vb.net/vb.net_database_access.htm 
Project-&gt;Add Reference-&gt;COM-&gt;Microsoft DAO 3.6 Object Library. There now you can use the code I just gave you and you still create the VB.Net Form with Textbox and Button the exact same way. 
python
I have my access database in references, do you know how to type in the location of the database? 
&gt; Using an access database for multiple machines on the same network can be done. It can be done yes, but should it? I think it would be better to recommend a SQL Express Instance
In coming disclaimer, stand-by: "From memory" I think you have to do .acceptchanges on the dataset to write the changes back to the DB.
okay thanks, ill try everything when i come home
Can you explain more? 
I thought that the inputbox1 was a textbox &gt;.&lt;
call Me.Update after moving. but be aware that if you want to create a game windows forms is clearly not the way because of the lack of... everything you need for game development. and also it will eat up your resources. you could use a timer for drawing, and clearing the form. even if you want to doodle something small and just for fun, you should use some libraries for that, like MonoGame.
I will try this out when I get home, but this seems like what I need, thanks. I'll update you if anything happens.
cool :) just remember zero index. when it the count hits zero you might want to give a msg saying.. "you've done enough already! Well done" or something to that effect. The example is pretty lazy, but gives you tons of scope to hoove it into your own code and tweak it without too much editing. :) Thanks for the upvote btw :) 
Things can be overwhelming, when you don't know what you're doing. But the truth is, there is no easy solution to these problems. You basically have to buckle down, figure it out, and get the work done. If somebody just gives you the answer, that only moves you one more step forward in a million mile journey. 
can anyone help? 
I would but I've to have the program done by tomorrow 
and was assigned when?
You're not the dad of me!!!1!!1!
Monday. I've had a total of maybe 6 hours to work on it so far and haven't found a solution
I don't think you need vba for this. Excel has a data function to remove duplicates in a column. After that, there's a function for median
-23 / 26 is zero, remainder is -23. -23 mod 26 = -23
Okay thanks. Do you know how I can get the desired result?
Thats what i thought the problem was too that i was assigning something to i but ive tried every other way I can think of because I cant assign i into the listbox outside of the loop statement
Don't use i for anything else if you're using it as your iterator (you can read from it, but shouldn't modify it unless you know exactly what you're doing). You probably need to add the items one by one, so your .Add command goes inside the For. Right now you're only adding one item, whatever dblresult has at that point, which is the final iteration value because you assigned dblresult = i. Not sure exactly what you're trying to do or what you have before or in your form, so I can't give you any more advice. But, in general, whenever you're coding, you need to be sure you understand what each line does and why, not just think it magically works somehow. 
Google is wrong in this case. X Mod Y is the remainder after dividing X by Y. -23/26 is zero with a remainder of -23. Check the calculator on Windows, it gives -23 too. 
On Error Goto ErrorHandler ErrorHandler: Exit Sub
If you can't find how to do this online, you're not looking in the right place. Search for For-Next loop, look at some code examples, and the solution should become apparent. 
sorry I dont recall getting that. Are you using the Opticon DLL as it just worked right from the get go once I figured out the weird numbering they use for COM ports (COM1 was 0 and so on)
I'm unclear whether you have one loop with 10 iterations or two loops. Something like this? dim MyNumber as integer dim PrevResult as integer try mynumber = cint(textbox.text) Catch ex As Exception end Try for x as integer = 1 to 10 MyNumber = function(MyNumber ) if MyNumber &lt;&gt; PrevResult then textbox.text = "Loop: " &amp; x &amp; ":" &amp; MyNumber .tostring PrevResult = MyNumber end if next
The profilic drive is for the USB adapter. It is just a USB to serial adapter. The port on the CS1504 is not USB despite being a USB type connector (naughty Symbol) Then to communicate with the scanner from VB you need a SDK available from Opticon http://old.opticon.com/Software-Opticon--01022310000018.aspx The OPN-2001 is basically a near identical scanner just more modern so has an up to date DLL for .net I did try sending my own data to the scanner by capturing packets sent to it but I couldn't get any results other than a light to flash so the SDK is really required if you plan to use .net with it
 "Dim txtNumber As TextBox" i've never ever seen a textbox being declared before? I just add them to the form. "TxtNumber.Add" &lt;-- textboxes dont have an "add" property? What are you using? vb6? vba? 
Yes I tried both, but not much luck so far (except for some LED blinking). Did you install the same driver though? Or use a different one? Thanks for the info so far!
How was the data added to the DGV? Generally you sort the data that's bound to the DGV. Are you storing both the first and last name in the same column? Ideally you'd want to separate them into two columns, so that you can sort by either. 
You can use [this overload of the sort method](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wstxtkxs(v=vs.110\).aspx) and implement your own Comparer that parses the text and compares the second word in both strings. 
Load a text file into an array: Dim lines() As String lines = My.Computer.FileSystem.ReadAllText("C:\TextFile.txt").Split(vbCr) 
How are you creating the forms? Do you have a code snippet you can share?
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bfkbc5a3(v=vs.100).aspx
The .Net framework can do it for you: Dim lines = IO.File.ReadAllLines("D:\filename.txt") 
I think for this to work as you expect, the DataGridView can not be data bound at design time. Then you should able to use the ComboBox1.SelectedIndexChanged event on your drop down box to DataGridView.DataSource = SomeTable
I googled that error message and found some solutions.
This line is wrong. If ListBox.SelectedIndex = -1 Then Should read something like: If ListBox1.SelectedIndex = -1 Then The name of the first listbox on your form should normally be ListBox1.
need more information. Do you want to scrape and existing webpage, or do you want to use a web browser control load the page and change the information in the page?
something that might help you could be the [IndexOf method](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k8b1470s.aspx) to find the position of text within strings. you may be able to search through your data to find matches for `route_id` and `scheduled_departure_utc`. 
This worked ! 
I believe you can convert to a list with some json import (do some quick googling or vs might sugest an import based of off this-&gt;)and then use dim list = json.deserialize (json object) then use a linq query to slim down your list to the correct values. I'm on mobile and my memory is not the best so sorry I couldnt be any more help.
Line #11. Remove the quotes around the variable filePath1.
Thank you :) It worked :)
I see two things. First, I wonder if you would be better off using arrays. I.E. Using something like Color_of_Peg [3], so then you could use the same code to analyze each peg. The second, when you are setting up the initial pegs, you randomize as follows: color_red = Rnd() * 3 + 1 I take that to mean you are randomizing the position of red between 1 and 4, but you do that for each color so you could have multiple colors assigned to the same position, which would over write each other. the better choice would be to take each peg and assign a random color to it. The big thing tho is the arrays. You can adjust the number of allowed turns and the code will be much simpler.
The datatype determines the precision, and if you are that concerned then double is entirely the wrong type for your use case. As for your 2nd reason, you don't really have a number, you have a numeric string, so you should use the String type. EDIT: also, separate code and storage from display formating. You may still use double and format to 4 digits on display
Hi there, this is used because even if one item was checked beforehand, it would select both items.
&gt; One is that to an engineer or scientist, decimal places convey precision. Excel just removed the precision information conveyed by 179.5950 You misunderstand the fundamental idea conveyed by precision. If you are hand-calculating precision, you include the required number of zeroes, but not because it's important to do so. It is only the way for a human reader to easily remember the precision. There is never, ever going to be a case where a computer needs this sort of reminder of how much precision there is. The precision of a single-precision (4-byte) real is one in 2147483648. It's actually never as low as the 1 part in 1 million that the trailing zero you want implies. Trailing zeroes aren't even an accurate representation of its precision - the computer doesn't do math in base-10.
Not sure of why you're encountering this issue as I use it in a similar fashion with my file encryptor and it never encountered this problem. Here's my FileIO functions that I use: Private Function PeekFile(ByVal FilePath As String) As Byte() Return File.ReadAllBytes(FilePath) End Function Private Function PokeFile(ByVal FilePath As String, ByRef Data() As Byte) As String File.WriteAllBytes(FilePath, Data) Return S2H(GetHash(Data)) End Function The `PokeFile()` function simply returns an SHA256 hash of the file after it's been written. It's not essential for everything to work properly.
Basically this... Sub Test() ' For each Thing2 in column 'B' For Each Thing2 In ActiveSheet.UsedRange.Columns(2).Cells Thing2.Select Thing2.Offset(0, 17) = 0 ' For each thing in column 'A' For Each Thing1 In ActiveSheet.UsedRange.Columns(1).Cells ' If Thing2 is column 'B' then Thing2.Offset(0,17) is column 'S' Thing2.Offset(0, 17) = Thing2.Offset(0, 17) + (Thing1 * Thing2) Next Thing1 Next Thing2 End Sub 
Is there an error in your second Do loop? Should this, read this? Do Until index = list.Length Or status2 = True Do Until index = list2.Length Or status2 = True Should be list2 right? 
Note: the actual code does not reflect the example I gave above, which was to illustrate the problem simply.

hmmm...not enough information. I will venture a guess and say you are taking the value for the textbox from the table and not the datagrid. The record order could be different. 
I need them to be different number, I'm trying to figure out how to use arrays to do that currently
Something like 'Put the value of the selected row from the first 'column into a textbox txtName.Text = dgv.CurrentRow.Cells(0).Value Off the top of my head but it should be close to this format.
I just realized there are some values from the data table that aren't displayed in the datagrid as columns but still need to be called to fill other textboxes, so even if I fill textboxes based on current selected rows, some textboxes would be "orphaned" as they depend on the data table's row indexes, which wouldn't change even if the order of displayed rows are changed on the datagrid. Is there a column header click event for datagrids that I can use so that when I click on say, a "name" column header, I would change the search string that populates the datagrid so that it would order by "name asc/desc" in the database and then change the row order in the data table depending on which column header I click on? This way I could keep filling my textboxes from the data table, but this time I would be modifying the table based on how I sort the datagrid.
Pretty sure there is something like that. However, you could just pass the ID back into a query and retrieve the row of information to get the info that the dgv doesn't hold. Another option would be to fill a dataset with the results from your original query, set that dataset as the datasource for your dgv and limit it to only display the columns you want it to see. From this I think you could retrieve the other column values as you click on different rows.
tweq, Thank you for replying. What I heard you say (1) is that excel truncates trailing zeros as part of the language. (2) is that trailing zeros in excel are purely there for display formating. (3) is that if I desired to use trailing zeros, then I should either convert a number data type into a string and the string would preserve the trailing zeros (4) or that i should have stored the initital data as a string from the getgo and thus avoid any number to string conversion. Did I understand you? 
Thank you for responding. what I heard from you is: (1) precision is NOT determined by the trailing zeros within excel. (2) precision is defined by data type (3) in actuality, my input data is not numeric but a numeric string and so I should treat it as a string (4) You suggested that I separate my code thinking and storage thinking from display thinking. Your comments brought forth a question. When I type numbers into a worksheet cell, what are their data types? I assumed that when I click on format and select text or number I am explicitely declaring the data type of data entered into the cell. Is my understanding correct? 
Actually, after a little more thought. An easy way to do this would be to populate a dataset and set the datatable as the datasource for the datagridview. Next, only set the Name and ID columns visible and then set up a databinding for the data in the other textboxes. Example: Dim ds As New DataSet Dim sql As String = "SELECT * FROM Employee ORDER BY EmployeeID" Dim da As New OleDbDataAdapter(sql, con) da.Fill(ds) DataGridView1.DataSource = ds.Tables(0) For Each c As DataGridViewColumn In DataGridView1.Columns If c.Index &lt;&gt; 0 And c.Index &lt;&gt; 1 Then 'hide all but the first 2 columns of the table in the grid c.Visible = False End If Next 'Here is where we bind the textbox to the column in the 'datatable TextBox1.DataBindings.Add("Text", ds.Tables(0), "Rate") TextBox2.DataBindings.Add("Text", ds.Table(0), "HireDate") 'in this example, there are 2 columns (rate and hiredate) in the data. 'You are binding textbox1's Text property to the rate column of the ds 'table and binding textbox2's Text property to the HireDate column of 'the ds table. Now whenever you focus on a new row, 'the bindings populate the textboxes accordingly. 
That's so weird. I got it to work by making it copy the file and creating a new one and editing the new one. But now there are two files so I tried making it delete the old one but it comes up with the same error. I don't know honestly. At least it can Encrypt and Decrypt the text. But there is still a file with the Plain text. The only way to solve this problem is to manually delete the old file which can be annoying.
Perhaps you need to overwrite the file once you've "encrypted" the contents?
I don't think you posted this in the right place
Quick googling gave me this: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/316383/how-to-automate-word-from-visual-basic-.net-to-create-a-new-document Good luck, Hope this helps.
Do you actually need the word document to be auto generated, or will you have an existing word document that is basically a template, and you need to fill in certain areas on this document with the answers to the users questions? 
what's your level of coding experience? i'd do this with the content control. 
In VB6, parameters are passed by reference by default (unless marked as `ByVal`). Also, unless ~~`Option Strict`~~ is enabled, variables do not need to be declared before they are used.
when not specified vb makes new variables a Variant type. you need to find yourself a copy of VB to install, you'll drive yourself mad otherwise as this code looks like it's probably terrible and stepping through the debugger is going to be needed. I believe the vbp file will have something noting what VB version it is.
Can't see anything in the .vbp, but in the .vbg it says "VBGROUP 5.0". Do you know how I can get this running in a debugger?
Find a copy of VB6 to open it or VB.NET 2008 express to convert it. 
If you don't assign values to enumerations they will by default, start with 0 and increment by 1.
😲 This is news to me!
You're defining two property variables as public, exposing them instead of your properties functions. Public packageName As String Public itemDescription As String They should be private like the rest. 
Yes, very handy. consider the following when used to dimension an array. I can add items to the static array using a 'Length' enumeration at the end. Enum Test_e As Long Description Mode Bandwidth Modulation Power Name Length End Enum aStuff = Array.CreateInstance(GetType(String), Test_e.Length) For i As Integer = 0 To Test_e.Length - 1 ... 
you likely need vb6. that is also the only debugger.
Thank you
Right
Not sure if they want you to use built-in methods, but [`Array.Sort`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.array.sort\(v=vs.110\).aspx) may help you.
Can do it with 0 if statements if you'd like Dim a As Integer = 16 Dim b As Integer = 14 Dim c As Integer = 11 Console.WriteLine({a, b, c}.OrderBy(Function(x) x).Skip(1).First())
This seems like the most efficient way, but my comsci teacher says that there is a way to do it with 2 statements, and I can't figure it out. My current code requires at least 2 and at most 3.
Ok, I'll try re-installing it, hopefully it works
Did you take a photo of your screen?
There is no universal way of doing so, the size depends on the kind of data stored at that address.
The data that's returned is actually an array of hex that I am converting into ascii string. What is returned: 4d-79-4e-61-6d-65-49-73-4d-75-64-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00 What it's converted to: MyNameIsMud There are trailing spaces behind it that I am trying to get rid of, or to change the size of the array to accommodate different lengths.
Did you click the ASP.NET and web development box during the install?
I did for VS 2017, but that option was not given when I was downloading VS 2010 
I think you have to explicitly download MVC for 2010.
Yep. Looks like it needs VS 2010 SP 1 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30683
You probably have an Express version, and in those you have to download separate versions for each kind of app you want to build. Your teacher is probably using a Pro SKU or higher, and is why they are getting more options. Once you go to '13 or higher, you can get the Community SKU, and have all of the options that are only available in Pro or higher in the older versions. 
What have you already done for this project? Are you stuck on something specific? Do you just need a kick start?

Was I not specific with what I am asking? I just don't understand how to make the college majors appear in the right list box when the user selects one of the buttons.
Regarding the storing of user passwords: [Resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtInClXe1Q) [Resource 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8tUW8Z96dI) These videos offer some very important guidelines when you create a user account DB.
We arent using a website or something accessiable, they just wanted to make stuff easier to them (They used an unprotected excel file on a computer, we are adding the password to avoid any unwanted friends/clients logging onto stuff)
Try something like this For l_index As Integer = 0 To MyListBox.Items.Count - 1 Dim l_text As String = CStr(MyListBox.Items(l_index)) Next http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12755701/vb-net-getting-each-item-in-a-listbox-and-finding-its-text-index
MyListBox is the ID of the list box on your form. l_index starts at 0 and will iterate up until the number of items in your listbox -1
I'm getting an error under "==" that says "expression is expected". When I remove one of the = the error goes anway and I can run it but it doesn't work, nothing shows up in the 3rd textbox.
Walk through your code. Make sure it is iterating through the list box. I don't think == is a thing in VB sorry I mostly code C#. Do you know how to debug? Put in a break point and set variables to watch?
I fixed it!!! it works. Yeah "=" is the right way to do it in VB. I got it to display the students name, I also need it to display the name of the major on a 4th listbox called lstMyMajor and I need to to show how many students are Computer sci majors on a 5th listbox called lstNumMajor. Any ideas on how I should go ahead with that? Thank you so much!!!
I'm off work now. Good luck with the rest of the project.
Ok, I think I can figure it out from here on. Thank you so much for your help.
The "==" is equality syntax from another language like c#. It's a typo and doesn't apply to VB. The code should populate the third list box correctly. The textbox portion still has to be coded. This will be done after the loop. I am purposely giving you hints and trying not to give you the answer.
Thank you I understand this. So my textboxes are labeled txtMyMajor and txtNumMajor. I think the way I should do this is like this if l_text = "CS" then lstMyListBox.Items.Add(CStr(lstStudents.Items(l_index))) endif if l_text = "CS" then txtMyMajor.text = "Computer Science" This unfortunately does not work. And I am still figururing out how to count how many CS majors there are, I assume I next to make another loop?
* in what language should I write the code? * do I need a switch/hub/router to connect more than two persons?
You originally wanted to use VB.net so go with that. The System.Net namespace has all kinds of classes for doing communication over a local area network and the internet. I suggest spending time researching those APIs. If you are stuck in something then check back with another more specific question. This should be a fun project for you. Good luck.
Thank you very much, I'll look into this System.Net namespace.
You're certainly able to do this in VB.NET since you've asked the question here in the VB sub. You'll need some sort of networking device to enable multiple connections if devices are unable to create adhoc connections. If you're only doing a single point to point connection, you wouldn't need anything too fancy. If you're wanting this application to be flexible, you'll need a method of handling multiple TCP connections at the same time, while also managing the sending and receiving of data between them all.
Thanks for your help. It got accepted. 
That type of setup would result in an extremely slow user experience. It also would quickly bog down the database with the constant high frequency queries. It would be best to manage connections directly versus trying to maintain an unsustainable configuration.
No of course i dont, i just don't mind it because they didnt need that much protection, they needed something fancy and i suggested adding the login system
I have developed several database applications using visual basic on MS SQL Server as well as MYSQL. I wrote one app with one person in mind who was quite skilled at computers. I skipped several steps in error checking because there is no way this person would do that. Well jobs changed and the new person wasn't sharp. The program started crashing and errors started showing up in data. Eventually I found a bug that had never come up because the old person wouldn't "do that". Never assume your user isn't a complete noob who is trying to break your program.
Use XML, there is already classes made for reading, writing, and encrypting. It's a native feature in .NET and is very easy to use. Or just use My.Settings, which is still XML.
Easiest way is like this Dim rainfallByYear = New Double () {values,in,here,} Where each of the comma delimited values are the rainfall data
* Where's the data? File? Db? Human input? Thin air? (see what I did there? Thin air, rainfall? hee hee) * What is the format of the data? XML? CSV? What are the columns?
I tried this but the center image would flash because i'm calling a refresh every 0.5 seconds to update the second hand and the alarm built into the clock. However I did solve this solution. Posting as a top comment how now.
I have discovered a work around from this page: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15266954/get-the-name-of-controls-buttons-dynamically It solves the problem but I have found another(might be easier to solve): Dim arrBtn = {b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8, b9} For Each b In arrBtn b.BackgroundImage = Nothing b.SendToBack() b.Enabled = True Next Now the issues with this is that if I want to use the array in another sub procedure I have to declare inside the class, but if it isnt declared inside the sub containing the For loop, the for loop will read blank values in the array. example screen shots: when the array is declared inside the class outside of any sub procedures http://i.imgur.com/HqDuPa0.png when the array is inside the sub procedure containing the For loop http://i.imgur.com/KDuuLUQ.png Im also interested in why my original approach doesnt work correctly, if anyone can figure out why that is... :) 
Yeah that is because you can't modify a collection while looping through it.. You can change BtnNewGame_Click sub to this (essentially putting the controls into an array which makes it concrete) : Private Sub NewGame_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles NewGame.Click Dim buttons = Me.Controls.OfType(Of Button)().ToArray() For Each b As Button In buttons If b.Name &lt;&gt; "NewGame" Then b.BackgroundImage = Nothing b.SendToBack() b.Enabled = True End If Next Array.Clear(cells, 0, cells.Length) playerturn = 1 End Sub 
The number as an integer type will not have a comma, but any time you will display this number, it is converted into a string. So you should pass in a parameter to the ToString method to display it as you want. The "N" is for number formatting, and the 0 is the number of decimal places you want to display. Dim myInt As Int64 = 46321224201 MessageBox.Show(myInt.ToString("N0"))
Thanks for your reply, this is similar to what I've done in the comment I left above yours and it works so long as you keep the creation of the array inside the sub procedure as the forloop using it. This causes it to run into the same issue as I posted in my comment above aswell :(
Right.. I would assume that is probably because the array is created before the buttons are initialized. Its been a while since i looked at the life cycle of windows forms.. so its just a theory. Maybe set the value of the array variable on form_load..
Are you familiar with the bitmap class?
What parameters do I need to set on a DropDownList to allow freetext editing/selection as well as the given selections? (That is the point of having a ComboBox over a ListBox) e.g. you give a selection of top 10 car manufacturers to ease it for most, but as there is a LOT of other manufacturers you allow the users to type that data manually.

Shame they deleted the post. I work for the company that made the software for who wants to be a millionaire. We use it as a training project now.
Correct. Windows Forms not Web. I share in your disappointment.
`CInt` converts a value to an integer and rounds them if necessary. Also, all your fractional literals like `258.6` are `Double` (binary floating point) literals. If you want the precision of `Decimal`, you need to declare them as `258.6D`.
Thanks. I didn't know about the cInt rounding, but it makes perfect sense now. I'm a little fuzzy on how to do the second part. If you could explain a little further
There are multiple data types that support fractions: `Single`, `Double` and `Decimal`. The first two are binary/base 2 floating point formats, `Decimal` is as the name implies a decimal/base 10 floating point format. The default format for numeric literals with fractions is `Double`, unless specified by a [literal suffix](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dzy06xhf.aspx) like `1.2D`. There are [countless explanations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic#Accuracy_problems) of the pitfalls of binary floating point numbers out there, but the gist of it is that they cannot represent certain values precisely, just as decimal fractions cannot precisely represent 1/3. For example, your `258.6` is actually `258,60000000000002` and `227.1` is `227,09999999999999`. Typically these minuscule differences don't matter since they are just rounded away, but since you're using `Decimal` in other places I figured I'd mention it.
Thank you Soo much. Everything is accurate now. I had only ever used cInt, I didn't know cDbl or cDec were even an option. I've replaced all the cInts with cDec and only rounded the values I want rounded.

"code an array" means what, exactly? there are many ways to use arrays.
I think what you're talking about is more sophisticated than just database updates. Some central server would have to keep track of clients accessing the system and send notifications to all the client apps to update it presentation. Naturally the client app must be written to listen for these messages. X1 commits an update, the server sends notifications to all clients to make them aware of the update and update their view. This is beyond your normal database concurrency. Ok, so how do I handle it. Frankly for me its a people problem. The group working with the data must communicate to each other that they working on a particular dataset. Journaling is also very important, using triggers I can log every change to the tables. It's an interesting problem that I'm going to research tomorrow.
If you're going to be polling the database, you can use a timestamp (aka rowversion on SQL Server) to keep track of the last change you've seen. You can then only select the rows where the rowversion is greater than the last one you've seen. One problem is that it doesn't work for deletes (removing a row doesn't increment any rowversion).
Hey guys, someone suggested I match my brackets to IIf statements for legibility and the answer became much more clear and I nested the secondarraddressline2 iif around the code shown in the op as such: =IIF(IsNothing(Fields!SecondaryAddressLine2.Value), IIf(IsNothing(Fields!AccountBillToLine1.Value), IIf(IsNothing(Fields!ContactBillToLine1.Value), IIf(IsNothing(Fields!AccountLine2.Value), IIf(IsNothing(Fields!ContactLine2.Value), "", chr(13)+chr(10)+Fields!ContactLine2.Value ), chr(13)+chr(10)+Fields!AccountLine2.Value ), IIf(IsNothing(Fields!ContactBillToLine2.Value), "", chr(13)+chr(10)+Fields!ContactBillToLine2.Value ) ), IIf(IsNothing(Fields!AccountBillToLine2.Value), "", chr(13)+chr(10)+Fields!AccountBillToLine2.Value ) ) , chr(13)+chr(10)+Fields!SecondaryAddressLine2.Value)
So here is my assignment above. I have set the foundation of the arrays. I am just not sure on how I will be plucking the information from the arrays to display into the year, model, and cost labels.

Below is the code I have so far: Public Class Form1 Private strIds() As String = {"BL15", "CD64", "CS10", "CA05", "CC12", "CC94", "CS06", "FE13", "FM05", "JEEP!"} Private strItems(,) As String = {{"BL15", "2015", "Buick LaCrosse", "$19,000"}, {"CD64", "1964", "Cadillac DeVille", "$11,000"}, {"CS10", "2010", "Cadillac SRX", "$15,995"}, {"CA05", "2005", "Chevrolet Avalanche", "$13,900"}, {"CC12", "2012", "Chevrolate Camero", "$25,000"}, {"CC94", "1994", "Chevrolet Caprice", "$6,000"}, {"CS06", "2006", "Chevrolet Silverado", "$13,995"}, {"FE13", "2013", "Ford Explorer", "$25,900"}, {"FM05", "2005", "Ford Mustang", "$9,500"}, {"JEEP!", "2013", "Jeep Wrangler", "$21,995"}} Private Sub BtnSearch_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnSearch.Click Dim strSearchId As String Dim intSub As Integer = 0 Dim dblItemPrice As Double strSearchId = txtID.Text Do Until intSub = strItems.GetUpperBound(0) + 1 OrElse strSearchId = strItems(intSub, 0) intSub = intSub + 1 Loop If intSub = strItems.GetUpperBound(0) + 1 Then MessageBox.Show("Invalid ID") ElseIf intSub &lt;= strItems.GetUpperBound(0) Then Double.TryParse(strItems(intSub, 1), dblItemPrice) End If lblID.Text = strSearchId End Sub End Class 
If it is a program located in the system folder, the Process.Start() command will look for it in there, if you do not specify a path, but the name only. If it is an arbitrary file, of course you have to search for it first, what kind of magic do you expect here? With only the name of your program, i would say that you look for it in the most common places first, i.e. leaving out the system folders or the directory for pictures etc.
Is it something that you are installing?
Basically the process I'm looking for is called LeagueClient. I want the program to find the LeagueClient.exe but without having to manually tell the software where it is using a file dialog. I know I have to search for it but the problem is I don't know how to do that exactly. 
Basically, the program edits a file for a game so that you can change server but also keep the language of your main server. (Changes the server to Russia whilst keeping the English language) Once they press the button to change their server, I want the game to start up so they don't have to do it manually. Problem is they can install the game in different directories when they first install the game. 
good grief.
I'd assume a curve grading formula is something you could find on the internets. you do need a loop, but not for each of the curve options. just pull the selected value and use it in the formula.

vb sure looks fun
yes you can make games, but if you are about games development C# would be a better fit.
agree with the C# comment. I started in computers with the basics and visual basic, so I am a huge fan... but if you are going to start learning, C# is close enough that its the same effort, and has infinitely more options to move into. 
VB is nice, my office uses it almost exclusively. It's not perfect, but you can learn it quickly and it can do anything C# can
Also this is how i populate the collection http://puu.sh/vIXnq/a3159bf487.png My program allows me to add or update the collection and I want to be able to put the new info in the file.
Thanks a bunch. I'm using streamReader and have set each line to a variable but having it rewrite/update the last line in each user is proving difficult.
It should let you run anything you want if it's a admin account on the PC. Screenshot would be helpful. 
It sample 1 you are creating a new item, instead of using an item in your collection. You'll need to use the item in the collection and then the commented code will work. In sample 2, you are calling .ToString. but you haven't created a custom override for ToString, so you just get the name of the object back. If you want to use ToString, then create a new Override for ToString in your Inventory class, and return whatever format you want written to the file. 
for the record win10 does have Run as Administrator 
Yep... 
Is it Windows 10 on a PC (like Home Edition)? There are Windows 10 on devices that can only run programs from the Window Store. If that is the case, you'll need to convert your program to a "Universal Window Platform" before it'll run.
elements.GetAtomicNumber returns a string. zips.GetInfoByZIP returns an xmlnode. Try using... Dim zipList As System.Xml.XmlNode = zips.GetInfoByZIP(txtZip.Text) ' This works for me. Dim zipNode As XmlNode = zips.GetInfoByZIP("33004") Dim zipList As XDocument = XDocument.Parse(zipNode.InnerXml) 
It would guess it is the SmartScreen. But that should be quite easy to be allowed to run anyway. Like on those first two pictures [here.](https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5593-change-windows-smartscreen-settings-windows-10-a.html)
so if i declare intCounter globally then I should be good? or will i need to change the select case. i'll try it when i'm back at school
This won't actually matter. Since it's a static variable, it will hold it's value just the same as a private form level variable will. I'm not saying this is the best solution, but it's not the cause of this problem. 
Your btnRun_Click doesn't have it's event handler wired up anymore (you can see the Handles .... missing from the end of the sub). You can either delete / recreate the button, or the simple fix is to go to the end of the line and add "Handles btnRun.Click" This can happen sometimes if you cut and paste the button in the designer. 
Assuming List1 starts with 3 items. When the event is triggered, ReDim ArrayItems(List1.Items.Count) sizes the array to have 3 elements. If List1 has an item selected then list2.Items.Add(List1.SelectedItem) adds the selected item from List1 to list2 and List1.Items.Remove(List1.SelectedItem) removes the selected item from List1. List1 now has only 2 items. The array will elements will be populated by ArrayItems(0) = 550, ArrayItems(1) = 650, and ArrayItems(2) = 500. Now, the next time the event is triggered ReDim ArrayItems(List1.Items.Count) sizes the array to have only 2 elements because something was removed from the list the first time the event was triggered. ArrayItems(0) = 550 and ArrayItems(1) = 650 are fine but there is no longer a third element in the array, so ArrayItems(2) = 500 would trigger an index out of bounds error. That's about all I can say from looking at the code. Not sure why you have the array or why you are resizing it.
I declared them as strings under the class line.

Im no expert, so this may not help as much as it does. But I was playing around with this to see if I could get it to work. I managed to make the error not pop up: Look at your first bits of code here: Public Class Form1 Dim intvotes() As Integer Dim intcounter As Integer Const FMTSTR = "{0,-17}" Private Sub btnnominate_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnnominate.Click If txtnominate.Text &lt;&gt; "" Then ReDim Preserve intvotes(intcounter) intvotes(intcounter) += 1 lstcandidates.Items.Add(String.Format(FMTSTR, txtnominate.Text)) Else MsgBox("enter a valid candidate",, "input error") txtnominate.Focus() Exit Sub End If ' lstcandidates.Items.Add(String.Format(FMTSTR, (0))) txtnominate.Focus() txtnominate.Clear() End Sub When you clock the Nominate button and you are ReDimming your intvotes Array here: ReDim Preserve intvotes(intcounter) Intcounter has yet to be defined. So what is it putting? "Intvotes(null)?" Intvotes(0)?" All I did was add this: If txtnominate.Text &lt;&gt; "" Then intcounter = intcounter +1 ReDim Preserve intvotes(intcounter) intvotes(intcounter) += 1 and the error stopped Is it possible that you were just reDimming the first item in the array over and over again, but adding to a list, so that while the list may go on and on, the Array was still one item? 
Yea i saw it. The error is in the intvotes(intcounter) +=1 right? I know the may sound stupid but when i was working on it early in the morning yesterday i guess it didnt save like i thought it did so when i was working on it again late last night i didnt realuze it as i was rushing to get it done since i have to get that ana another one in by 9:30 am today. But thank you so much
To do what you're asking would require creating a custom control. I think what you're really looking for is the Treeview. 
You are trying to convert the input to an integer before you even know if it is a number
 Dim intNumberA As Integer Dim intNumberB As Integer If IsNumeric(txtNumberA.Text) And IsNumeric(txtNumberB.Text) Then intNumberA = CInt(txtNumberA.Text) intNumberB = CInt(txtNumberB.Text) If intNumberA &gt; intNumberB Then lblResult.Text = "Number A is greater" ElseIf intNumberB &gt; intNumberA Then lblResult.Text = "Number B is greater" ElseIf intNumberA = intNumberB Then lblResult.Text = "Both are equal" End If Else lblResult.Text = "Please enter a numeric value" End If 
All the responses have been amazing! Thank you!
It gave me a basic idea. Thanks!
Glad I could help. I found it annoying that I couldn't type "=" anymore... so I made a better version that lets your type "=" if you hold down the CTRL key: Private Sub RichTextBox1_KeyDown(sender As Object, e As KeyEventArgs) Handles RichTextBox1.KeyDown If e.KeyCode = 187 Then ' = With RichTextBox1 Dim caretPosition = .SelectionStart ' Get current cursor position If My.Computer.Keyboard.CtrlKeyDown Then .Text = .Text.Insert(caretPosition, "=") ' insert = Else .Text = .Text.Insert(caretPosition, Chr(34) &amp; Chr(34)) ' insert "" End If .SelectionStart = caretPosition + 1 ' move the cursor one character ahead End With e.SuppressKeyPress = True ' tell windows you've handled the key End If End Sub It uses the KeyDown event instead of KeyPress.

What have you written in code so far?... 
This doesn't do any error checking (empty result set), assumes data you want is in column 0 (otherwise concatenate in the SQL, or in the VB for each loop), and leaves a trailing 0x0D 0x0A on the output string. Dim outputMultiline As String = "" Dim quantityLessThan As Integer = 5 Using con As New SqlConnection("data source=SERVERNAME;initial catalog=DATABASENAME;persist security info=True;user id=USERID;password=PASSWORD") con.Open() Dim sql As String = "SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE quantity &lt;= @number" Dim command As New SqlCommand(sql, con) command.Parameters.AddWithValue("number", quantityLessThan) Dim data As New SqlDataAdapter(command) Dim dt As New DataTable data.Fill(dt) For Each dr As DataRow In dt.Rows outputMultiline += dr(0) &amp; vbCrLf Next End Using Label1.Text = outputMultiline This would be quite easy to build in to a function that takes a SQL Query, and returns a multi-line string output if that's really what you're going for. That being said, whatever you're trying to do that results in outputting SQL to a multi-line label is probably the wrong way to do it.
Thank you for your input. I'm currently not using the SqlCommands, rather I'm using DBControls. What would change about this? I'll test this when I have time to some time today, thanks.

Is powershell an option over VBS?
The trouble you may have is if your data type in your query is not a string. Here's code that works on the DataGridView results. Function DoMyString() As String Dim sResult As New StringBuilder If DataGridView1.Rows.Count &gt; 0 Then For Each row As DataGridViewRow In DataGridView1.Rows If row.Cells(2).Value.ToString.Contains("0:") Then 'What I'm looking for For Each cell As DataGridViewCell In row.Cells sResult.Append(cell.Value.ToString &amp; ",") Next sResult.Remove(sResult.Length - 1, 1).Append(vbCrLf) ' Remove last comma and add vbCrLf End If Next End If Return sResult.ToString End Function 
Slightly more modern? C# is modern? Seriously? C# is just bad English compounded with bad punctuation.
powershell is an option over VBS, but not VBA. In VBA you can call the DLL and Win32 functions. I was using VBA in Excel to do (every/any)thing a full decade before powershell arrived.
Refering to WPF/UWP over WinForms
&gt;In VBA you can call the DLL and Win32 functions. You can do this in PowerShell as well. I'm not saying that Excel with VBA isn't wonderful. The excel interface provides a great data input front end to build on to. But when given the choice of buying ~150 excel licenses for users of an application vs deploying something quick and dirty in WinForms/WPF that requires 0 microsoft office licenses, I chose the cheaper route. 10 hours of my time is worth less than 150 licenses x ~$300 The two VB projects I still support are both Excel VBA, but only used by a few managers, so the licenses wasn't an issue. 
Who would downvote this? 
Not for what I am doing. The software suit I am working with is VBS based. 
I see, I've always worked in places where Office was ubiquitous.
Thank you Cland for helping me out. I found the issue. A list box item cannot have a set value, and instead has to be put into an if... then statement: If listbox.SelectedItem = ("Harvard") Then 350 (the price you wanted to set as a value) * 12 (credits) Thanks for the help! 
you have to take those kinds of comments in context. .Select, .ActiveCell, and .Activate have appropriate uses, and like anything else can be used when something else would be better, like .Range like using an if statement and a goto instead of a loop. that doesn't means you should never use if or goto.

When utilizing the `GetAsyncKeyState` API, you are making a call to the API to check the state of the key. If it is currently being pressed, it will return a non-zero value. If it is not being pressed, it will return zero. The easiest method of doing this is to set a timer to 100ms, and checking the intended keypress. This is not a fool-proof method of hotkey detection as it is prone to double detection, or completely missing the keypress if you hold the button down, or press the key too fast.

I think that's how we all do it man :)
Correct
title says vb6. in either case that only works when the form is the active window
Thanks for the explanation ViperSRT3g. The problem was timer, didnt set time to check for keypress. This is final cod, that worked how i wanted: Private Declare Function GetAsyncKeyState Lib "user32" (ByVal vkey As Long) As Intege Private Sub Timer1_Timer() If GetAsyncKeyState(66) Then MsgBox ("Test") End If End Sub Timer is set to 100ms. Now i will finde code number for key on multimedia tasters on tastature. Ty all for help.
My first tray was like you say. But program read key state only if focused. 
First thing you will have to do is setup the database. A couple options are MySQL or Access, I would suggest MySQL. There should be no shortage of tutorials in setting up MySQL.
Ah, if you thought I was sarcastic, I wasn't, geuss I worded myself badly, or you're just helping me out more, thanks again for that. Though, when installing, I'm standing back on configuring the server, which port should I use? The default is 3306, but I've read people being hacked when using that one, do you use it?
I would set it up with defaults. Those can always be changed later.
I love VB, but I don't think there's enough money in the world to ever get me to use VB6 again.
 I'd start with the VB For Absolute Beginners link in the sidebar. That will give you a high level overview of the VS, and VB. 
Sure, might be able to get some use out of it
thank you so much this was very helpful! I will take a look at the book!
I'll take a look! thanks for help!
Visual Basic or Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)?
VSCode can do vbs files well enough. but code in excel you'll be copy/pasting a lot, which gets old quick, especially if you're making changes while debugging.
It started out with VBA. But at this point I am kneedeep in Basic. 
Thank you. 
Collect the value of the combo, check the value in your select case statement and multiply the weight in the text box by the appropriate value for the planet selected. Write the results to the label. Seems pretty straight forward. 
The issue is that Im having trouble figuring out how i go about coding that.
As mentioned, a `Select Case` statement can be used. For example: ' Firstly, check txtWeightOnEarth.Text to make sure that it's a valid number ' Then, use Select Case to compute and output weight on selected planet Select Case cmbPlanets.SelectedItem Case "Planet A" txtOutput.Text = "Weight on Planet A is " &amp; CStr(CInt(txtWeightOnEarth.Text) * PLANET_A_VALUE) Case "Planet B" txtOutput.Text = "Weight on Planet B is " &amp; CStr(CInt(txtWeightOnEarth.Text) * PLANET_B_VALUE) ' and so on, adding planets and replacing CInt where appropriate ' (if the weight on earth is not always an Integer) You may also want to declare a variable to store the calculated result (regardless of the selected planet) and update the label at the end of the function according to that variable (to reduce the amount of repeated code). Alternatively, you may want to store the constants in a dictionary and perform lookups without using `Select Case` statements. 
Why the hell are people down voting this its a decent answer, their are better answers, but I believe this is the perfect answer for the user asking the question. 
How about fade away? 'In this example, create 2 forms and each form has 1 button. 'Each form has similar code to the following with the obvious changes for each form. Public Class Form1 Public UpdateOpacity As [Delegate] = Sub(fValue As Double) Me.Opacity -= fValue End Sub Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load End Sub Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Dim Doit As New Fade_cls With {.TheForm = Me} Dim Thd As New Threading.Thread(AddressOf Doit.FadeAway) Form2.Show() Form2.Opacity = 1 Thd.Start() End Sub Class Fade_cls Public TheForm As Form1 Sub FadeAway() Do Until TheForm.Opacity = 0 TheForm.Invoke(TheForm.UpdateOpacity, {0.01}) Threading.Thread.Sleep(10) Loop End Sub End Class End Class 
There are two registry keys you will need to modify HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters "Type"="NoSync"(off) "Type"="NTP" (on) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\tzautoupdate "Start"=dword:00000003 (off) "Start"=dword:00000004 (on) Here is an article on how to make the changes. Keep in mind that it will cause a UAC popup for administrative settings.

If you want the height and width of the form, use me.height and me.width. Otherwise can you show where you declare the variables width, height, and b? 
I tried that with the following initialization code, the minimizing works for me and restoring does not throw an exception Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load Dim Minimize As New FlatMini With {.Left = 100, .Top = 100} Me.Controls.Add(Minimize) End Sub I also don't understand why you need to set the form width and height? Windows restores the old values by itself
yeah i understand, i meant that the open source skin seems to be okay and the problem seems to be with your code which we don't have 
&gt; I'm not sure width and height are defined the width and height used in the code are defined in the parent classes which are included by statements like this Inherits ContainerControl 
I literally don't have any source code besides the skin class. Compiling after pasting the source generates a few controls for me. I click them, I drag them on the form and they automatically work (minimize, maximize, exit, the FormSkin (which is the form overlay) control, a few buttons and some combo boxes). The problem is not minimizing the program, because that works fine. The problem comes when I try restoring the skinned form from minimization (the taskbar). Might have something to do with the way the FormSkin control is being drawn. I'm not sure. Not too code-savvy.
Copy and paste the source for yourself then drag the FormSkin control on your form followed by the minimize button control. You'll see what I mean. (Have to remember to use .NET framework 4.0 for the skin to work I believe) Just want to give a huge thanks for helping me out thus far. You guys are great.
Oh okay, in this case i think the only person who could help you is someone who knows how your "generator" works. I tried the skin by adding the controls myself and in this case the minimizing and restoring works great. Have you checked what is stored in width and height when the error happens? it says argument exception, invalid parameter.
Is this what you mean? https://pastebin.com/XRiSUmnj
Thanks for sharing!
Thank you for the correction.
Oh, sorry. Basically, when a button is clicked, it pops open the other form and a thread is then started that causes the previous form to fade away to invisible. 
I use both, depending on what I need to save. If it's a single value setting, then my.settings is perfect. If I need to save an object or collection of objects, though, serialize to a .dat file it is.
 I'm teaching myself VB so I don't actually have homework assignments. My thought on this would be to build an array and assign each index from each letter in the word. Then, use that array to write the word backwards as a new variable and see if they match. Hopefully my logic is right since I'm new to all of this too.
