Let me re-organize what you wrote: &gt; TLC implementation ... is an optional optimization for hand written C-Mex Functions... [but] is required for a MATLAB S-function. Okay, and then: &gt; This code compiles and runs fine, as is, unless it is within a For-Each subsystem Right. And what is the error you get? &gt; S-Function block 'TestCrankGeo/Subsystem/S-Function' does not have a TLC implementation So whether you *think* it's an S-Function or not, Matlab is treating it as an S-Function because it's giving you an error about your S-Function. So, did you write the TLC implementation?
Can you post what your solution was, in the event someone in the future has the same problem and finds this post?
And if we laugh, it's out of insanity because our conditional statements had a single equal sign and not a double equal sign after hours of debugging
Thanks u/shtpst and u/ewjost I got it working, sort of. It's upside-down but when you're as much of a special case as I am you take even the smallest of victories. Your assistance is greatly appreciated. https://www.flickr.com/photos/146227431@N04/37497498501/in/dateposted-public/
we are of course using some of the toolboxes. But buying them and buying all doesn't make too much of a difference. Think of this way every toolbox is generally around 1kEUR and there are 30-40 toolbox and we are paying 11kEUR instead of (30-40)*1kEUR. That's what I mean. And note that if you want to deliver a product which has matlab runtime on it, needs a different contract than retail priced contract. So things are volatile and commercial licenses are tricky. 
This is what I have so far, obviously... it doesn't work. I also tried the given formula for functions but I don't really understand what it's asking. thanks https://pastebin.com/S9BuHhwy
The input values are what you are feeding the function. In your case you are feeding it x values. The outputs are what you get from the function, in your case y values. I am relatively new to matlab so I am not 100% sure how to feed it a domain, but I know that your function should look somewhat more like this: function y = equate(x) (new line after this) y = x^4-4*x^3-6*x^2+15; (new line after this) plot(x,y);(new line after this) end You would need to incorporate some method to input the domain though, put this should help to some degree.
Happy to help. Use the flipud command on the array that is upside down and it should fix things. You can either do it on the input column vector or the 2d array. See documentation for more info. 
Okay, thanks I tried this: https://pastebin.com/qeBdneWz however I get an error saying "not enough input arguments" when I try to use the "fplot(equate, [-3 6])" in the command window
Please read our [rules for submitting homework questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/462uwe/submitting_homework_questions_read_this/) and modify your post to meet our requirements. 
I tried that and it seem to make no difference but I'll have another bash. 
Okay so I'm not sure if this is what he is looking for, but I made it work. https://pastebin.com/0Zee0C3g Just so you understand what I did, I made the input x1 and x2 which would be the start and end of your domain. Then I created a vector that had all numbers from the first to the second number going by 0.1. Then I made a new y vector where I did the math need to each component. Finally I graphed it using the x and y vectors.
okay, I understand what that means. now, when you say vector, that's just a number right? Also, I get an error of input arguments when I throw it in my matlab, saying it's in line 2 with the x= [x1:0.1:x2]. Thanks for showing me that though, I kinda get what the x1, x2 thing means. I feel like i'm either an idiot or this system could be a little more intuitive haha
No a vector is a set of numbers. [0 1 2 3 4 5 6] is a vector. It can have an infinite number of values, but it is always just one long list. So the one I created has 91 values I believe. If -3.5 to 5 is your domain, it would look like this just with the ... actually being numbers continuing the sequence. [-3.5, -3.4, -3.3, ... , 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5.0] Are you actually calling the function? To call it you have to type the function name into the command window. So in your case you would type equate(x1, x2) just instead of x1 and x2 it would be the ends of your domain. In the function the x1 and x2 are just placeholders that tell the computer how many values will be given to the function and tell the function how to use those values once they get them. I should probably point out again though, I'm not sure if this is what is being looked for by the professor. There may be a different method that is used to plot. I have a lot less experience plotting then I do working with vectors. 
Okay, thanks! I tried the equate(-3, 6) and it worked. It worked real well. However the fplot thing is what they're asking for, fplot(equate, [-3 6]), I honestly don't understand what the difference would be. I appreciate your help on this. Cause this whole thing is new to me and my instructor kinda stinks.
Good news, I googled around a bit and figured out how fplot works. So while what I told you works, there is a better way to handle this in matlab. https://pastebin.com/RaVJsJhu This code takes the same imputs, the ends of the domains, but it graphs it without needed the vector. I copied it from the mathworks site though and just modified for this use, so I don't understand what all it does nearly as well as what I was trying to do. The same info goes about calling it though. You have to type it into the command window with the domain.
Sorry about all the extra stuff I had you do. Hopefully you learned about vectors at least. 
Wow, yeah definitely wouldn't have gotten there on my own. I really appreciate your help! If you're ever in Orlando, I owe ya one haha
`flipud()` will only switch a column vector - a vector that is "vertically stacked." If you have a row vector, then you need to use `fliplr()`. If `flipud` isn't working, try `fliplr`.
Yeah. No problem. Sorry that I had to learn along the way.
What happens when you try to activate Matlab before running it? You should be able to go to Start -&gt; Matlab r2017b -&gt; Activate
Same thing, it opens a blank window. I also tried launching the program straight from the exe in the program files thinking my shortcut was broken, but that didn't work either. 
since it seems you have found an answer, here is the easy way fplot(@(x) x^4-4*x^3-6*x^2+15, [-3,6])
Got it to work, didn't realise I had to do it as part of the contourf command 
I would contact Mathworks directly.
I've come to the same conclusion. I tried to uninstall just now and that window was blank too. Time to go rooting around in my program files. 
Also, more direct: sortorder = randperm(112);
This does not directly answer your question- but if you're a student, you most likely can get MATLAB for free through your school. That way, you don't have to worry about it. If you want to read up on the differences, you can see them [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/MATLAB_Programming/Differences_between_Octave_and_MATLAB). Mostly, MATLAB code (non-toolboxes) should work on Octave, but Octave does not always run on MATLAB. 
That's what I ended up figuring out. Took me forever to get there though. 
In which directory? I would assume that the file needs to at least be on the MATLAB path, or at least in your current folder.
Right mouse button &gt; open with ?
Welcome to coding. 
Nope, I tried. The script doesn't open. All I see is the Command Window and Workspace.
This series really helped me get off the ground: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiQn9CYbALY&amp;list=PLPhi9dVsEVfZOlbIPsrQx0drJlBX9T15r 
Great, that looks perfect skimming over it! And her voice is a nice change. Thanks!
The easiest way to diagnose the issue is to step through your Octave code in Matlab and see what errors pop up. On a more general note, you should be fine if you use the more vanilla functions from Matlab. 
there is a fair bit of syntax that only works in Octave. I'm not aware of any compatibility issues running Matlab code in Octave, but I'm sure it exists. Special care has to be taken for code to run in both environments, but it should definitely be doable.
I've only used Octave a very little amount, but could it be related to a function that's built into Octave but not vanilla Matlab (ie, a function that's in the Stats-toolbox on Matlab but included by default in Octave). The error she received would help out in determining if that was the case with an "Undefined function or variable..."
Again, thank you so much, this is exactly what I needed!
I'm Windows?
Does it happen with every script file or with just one?
Octave accepts language constructs that Matlab doesn't, there's an example of that on a blog called "Matlab sadness" (sorry, no link, I'm on mobile right now). It's entirely possible that you used one of those constructs. Or perhaps, you might have used a library function that doesn't exist or has a different signature in Matlab.
Commands you used sounds fine. Have you tried Pan Tompkins’ algorithm? Anyway don’t forget that the signal could be noisy anyway, maybe due to some electrodes’ issues. Where do your signal come from? 
Where is @derivs defined in your code?
At `W ≈ 3.551`, `P` tends toward zero. Therefore, you get a division by zero in `dP/dW`. The solver does not want to step over this singularity, so it decreases the step size over and over. This leads to a nearly infinite loop. If you enter an upper integration limit of `3.551` or lower, it will be pretty fast. I had 69 steps between `0` and `3.551` and it took less than a second to compute.
What you can also do is make a function which has as input the ending numbers ([10 20 30 40]) and spits out the corresponding sums. function [ S ] = Reddit_VectorInfiniteSeries_f( N ) S = zeros(1,length(N)); for i = 1:length(N) n = 1:N(i); powers = 1./(2.^n); S(i) = sum(powers); end For example. :) 
They might of just made it in another file. If i remember correctly the documentation tells you to do that on some, but you can just put them in there
Ah yes. Reactor Design. Where matlab is your best friend and worst enemy.
It's every script file. I'm on Windows 10.
Double clicking the m file opens Matlab and the script on my computer no problem. It *also* opens all of the scripts I had previously open, but the new one is on top. What version of Matlab are you using? Also, FYI, you can CTRL+ or SHIFT+ click at the Open dialog box and open multiple files at once. You don't have to open them one at a time, so I'm not sure what's so annoying about opening them in Matlab. It should be exactly the same once Matlab is running, whether you open them from a file explorer or open them from the open dialog.
Hey! There are several ECG peak detectors in the Matlab File Exchange which you could use instead of reinventing the wheel. I have recently implemented a modified version of the sample-to-sample angle version which is somewhat tolerant to noise (also on MFEX). W. R. T. Your question: I would advise against using smooth as it will spread out your peaks. Your Butterworth filter will take care of the high frequency components anyway....
I'm only gone from Matlab -&gt; Octave, and there were a few differences. Notably the way libraries were instantiated, and something with file handling. 
I'm using R2016a. It never opens the new script, and if Matlab is already open it just duplicates the matlab window if i click on a script in file explorer. I don't open new ones one at a time through Matlab, what's really annoying is having to go find the right folder that the new script is in through Matlab every time, even though I have the folder open in file explorer.
Did you pirate Matlab?
Maybe...
If you did, it is probably a side effect of the crack.
I'll ask for details from my dealer then, I'll stick to meth for now.
I'm using polymath so far and am fine
I never expect 100% compatibility. Octave touts itself as a superset language of Matlab (I personally like Octave better fwiw) so if you follow some Octave tutorials they may use some constructs not available in Matlab. For instance: x = (@(x) x + 1)([1, 2])(2) is valid syntax in Octave. Matlab requires more syntax: tmp = (@(x) x + 1)([1, 2]) x = tmp(2) On top of that - if you use any libraries not in the base language, then all bets are off. 
Definitely a crack issue..

We have [rules for submitting homework](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/462uwe/submitting_homework_questions_read_this/). You at least have to give it a try- show us what you've tried, be more specific of where you're stuck. Don't just vomit up 9 questions and say "hey guys, help!"
Wow lol wtf is this. Where did you get this book, what college is this? These have to be some of the worst "Matlab fundamentals" I've ever seen. Matlab is short for **Mat**rix **lab**oratory. It's not CAD software, and I can't see how anything on the first page of problems has *anything* that would strengthen core Matlab concepts. The problem with the first page is that you *could* use the built-in functions `area` and `perimeter`, after you define the shape, but you need the vertices to define the shape. That's the hard part of the problem, and *there isn't any easy or "fundamental" way to solve that problem with Matlab*. I mean, there isn't some matrix you can plug it in, or a `for` loop, etc. You can just hard-code the formulas and steps you would use to solve the problem, and then at that point you've basically reduced Matlab to a glorified graphing calculator. Second page is the same - hard code the formulas and use Matlab like a calculator. Third page is okay, but then the fourth page has you... *use a `for` loop to plot??* Wtf?? That's the biggest wtf in the book for me. If I rephrase the question, question 5.4 says, &gt; Plot *y = x^4 - 4x^3 - 6x^2 + 15* with MATLAB, using a `for` loop and the `plot` command, for values of *x* from -3 to 6. Seriously wtf. A loop to plot that?! 
So, I guess that would be my answer - hard-code everything and use Matlab like a calculator. Python has "pythonic" ways of doing things. Matlab doesn't have "Matlabic" was of doing things (beyond vectorizing), but those problems seriously don't utilize, encourage, or even *enable* the *possibility* of using any built-in functionality. 
Also - pro tip about college courses. Instructors generally outline the class and topics with the syllabus on the first day. If you find the pace of the class is too fast, try reading the material in the book before the day of class. You get a chance to digest the content yourself and can ask informed questions in class. 
&gt; Wow lol wtf is this. Where did you get this book, what college is this? These have to be some of the worst "Matlab fundamentals" I've ever seen. This! Holy moly, I cannot fathom how this is supposed to be used to learn MATLAB. It doesn't teach any matlab fundamentals, infact it is the opposite, forcing you to use a for loop to plot a simple polynomial, seriously what is this. Based on OP's history I can see that this is an introduction to engineering class. I guess I can somewhat understand why he would need to do these simple assignments, but why is he forced to do that in a combination of both excel and matlab? That makes zero sense to me. @op, apparently this needs to be handed in tomorrow? Best thing you can do is just hardcode scripts for the first couple of questions like: h = 30; w = 20; % height and width A = h*w; % Area [ft] You don't need any programming skills for this, its literally hard-coding all equations in matlab, you can easily do this in under an hour. For the latter questions involving making your own scripts, just read proper documentation and you'll be fine.
Should of just taught how to use the documentation

Good bot
Ok thanks! I will try to do as you said and show you guys what i come up with. 
OK, sorry. 
Yeah unfortunately my $50k tuition does not cover MATLAB. But thank you for the input. Ill bite the bullet for the student version. 
It's totally unclear what you're asking. You could draw like, a kitten or something. Or a rainbow. That would be beautiful. 
uh.....is that just a graph? You usually think of it as y value for x, but no reason not to reorient. 
Today in could have just used a ti calculator....
You could give all the x-values for each y-value by "flipping" the plot: plot(y, x); or you could plot all the x-values in addition to each y-value plot(x, y); hold on; plot(x, x); or you could label each point with the x-value plot(x, y) hold on text(x, y, num2str(x(:))); or any number of other things, you just [use your imagination.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8oAQOvOEXY&amp;t=5)
who wants to bet OP never comes back to this thread like 80% of the people that ask dumbass questions wtf is 'the data plotter' lmao
zoom in reallllllly close so that the x-values on the plot are essentially the same: https://imgur.com/p9QU9Vu
data plotter is the data cursor
You would have to use some variant of the find function to find the indexes of each digit. So you'd search for '1' then store the indexes where each '1' was, then make a binary array with a 1 in each place you found a 1 and a zero everywhere else. Plot that and color it red. On the same plot, repeat for '2' and '3'. Now that I think of it, the zero values will still be plotted. Maybe you can enter a null value? I'm not quite sure, and I'm on my phone so I can't check. 
[Logical Indexing](https://blogs.mathworks.com/loren/2013/02/20/logical-indexing-multiple-conditions/) is your friend. It's truly the best feature MATLAB has over other languages. Learn it, love it, use it. I'm not sure what your plot axes are, so I'm not sure how to give you an example, but if you read the link I gave you, or if you explain it a little better, you should be on track. 
For a sligthly more serious answer. I would use two dashed lines. Like this. And add tick labels. x = -5:0.01:5; y = 0.2*x.^3 + 0.5*x.^2 + x; hFig = figure; hAx = axes(hFig); hold(hAx, 'on'); xlabel(hAx, 'x'); ylabel(hAx, 'y'); title(hAx, '0.2*x^3 + 0.5*x^2 + x') hPlot = plot(hAx, x, y); x_of_interest = 2.4; y_of_interest = y(x == x_of_interest); hLine1 = line(hAx, [x_of_interest, x_of_interest], ... [hAx.YLim(1), y_of_interest], 'LineStyle', '--', 'Color', 'k'); hLine2 = line(hAx, [hAx.XLim(1), x_of_interest], ... [y_of_interest, y_of_interest], 'LineStyle', '--', 'Color', 'k'); hAx.YTick = sort([hAx.YTick, y_of_interest]); hAx.XTick = sort([hAx.XTick, x_of_interest]); 
Sample each file, or each individual clip in one file? What have you used in the past to analyze audio?
Sorry can see why that's unclear. I want to sample about 37 events from within the wav. file (each 8sec long) So I've just used matlab to produce basic graphs while offshore, things like frequency vs time and spectrograms. 
The easiest way is probably to use audioread() to dump the file into a (huge) vector, then (if each clip is the same duration) use reshape() to turn that one long vector into a 2d matrix of 8s samples. Then you can use spectrogram() or whatever you have been, on each row/column of the matrix corresponding to one event.
Okay yeah I can follow that (audioreads what I normally work with anyway). Thanks a lot Fs= 44100, 5min=300, 44100/300=147, 147*8=1176 So split the vector every 1176 rows?
The documentation for matlab is very good, I suggest you check out the page for structs. doc struct
Have you used any structs? How do you define a struct now?
How do you know what the correct answer should be?
Close... your Fs is samples per second, so you're gonna end up with 44100 * 8 = 352,800 rows per sample. Now that I do the math, if you just audioread() the whole file you'll get over 13 million values, which may be a smidge bigger than your system can handle. So your other option is using the second input argument to audioread() to specify the samples for just each event: audioread('filename.wav',1+(n*352800) : (n+1) * 352800) for n = 0: 38-ish.
There's a preview of how they want the results to be set up. A teacher just replied to my question saying that they might or mightn't actually be the answers, so I could be right as is. Not sure what to believe now, though
What have you tried? How did it work? What went wrong? 
Yes it just hit me with that problem. If I did that other way would I still be able to sum all the samples together ultimately?
You haven't provided any information to troubleshoot anything at all. It sounds like you wrote your own function to do numeric integration, you wrote your own function to butcher the data, you have your own set of data.... and you haven't provided **any** of it. My best advice would be to step through your code and compare what your code is doing to how you got the right answer. Click the `-` on the left side of the script editing window and set a break point, then click Step or press F10 to advance code one line at a time. You can use the command prompt while the script is being debugged like this to interact with the data as the script is stepped. Check your Matlab script's internal steps against what you would do by hand. *BUT*, if you won't post your raw data, won't post your function, won't post your manipulated data, and the professor says the "right answer" may not even be right, then I don't know what advice to give to help you. Good luck, maybe? Good luck.
Sum all the samples into one combined 8 second mess? Or sum all your analytic results? You can do whatever you want with Matlab, but it sounds like you need to explicitly lay out what you want to do before you start using any code.
You make a strong point.

Sum all of the 8s samples together into a single 8s clip. In theory this removes background noise. I will then divide by the number of samples which should result in me having an 8s file which characterises the seismic signature of the explosive. It's something that's fairly easy to do on bespoke software, but I won't have access to that at the time so I'm trying to prepare a matlab placeholder
The easiest way would be to use a for or while loop to iteratively audioread() each 8s chunk of data and add it to a running total. In practice this will only work if your events are all *exactly* 8s long, if the sound itself happens *exactly* at the same time for each 8s block, and so on. Otherwise you're going to have a lot of messy interference. You would need to use something like xcorr() to line up your samples, and given the ~100MB of data you're talking about this is becoming an uglier problem. A quicker workaround would be iteratively looping through each 8s sample, doing your analysis and saving the output... then aggregating your (much smaller) outputs.
Images? Really? I can't paste an image into Matlab. These are almost as useless as having no data at all. That said, it's not *completely* useless, it's just that I can't be bothered to transcribe any of it. I can still look at it, though, and I think your claim of: &gt; my function for the simpsons 1/3 rule is 100% correct Might not be true. In your code, it looks like you have `for` loops that count `i = 2:2:n-1` and `i = 3:2:n-2`, but the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_rule#Composite_Simpson.27s_rule) gives the summations as being `j = 1:1:(n/2)-1` and `j = 1:1:(n/2)`. You're counting by two, they're counting to half, so it's kind of the same, but you start with three for the odd increments instead of one. I'm not sure why you're doing it this way, but this seems to be common Matlab beginner issues that I think I was guilty of, too. You're assigning and re-using things when you could just set it in a loop. For instance, you have: sum3 = 0; x = a; x = x + (2*h); for i = 3:2:n-2 sum3 = sum3 + f(x); x = x + (2*h); end When the algorithm is written much cleaner, and it's arguably easier to transcribe the algorithm directly: sum3 = 0; for j = 1:1:(n/2) x = a + (2*j - 1)*h; sum3 = sum3 + f(x); end sum3final = 4*sum3; The difference could be slight, but your error is slight - you're off by 3.4 out of 426.6, which is ~0.8% error. Even if the algorithm *is* actually correct, it's really hard to look at when trying to compare to anything else. The harder it is to read, the harder it is to verify, the harder it is to debug, the harder it is to fix. *Practice writing code with clarity.* That said, it could also be the fact that you're only using 5 steps. Try increasing the number of steps you're using.
The explosions happen at a very controlled 8s period so that isn't a concern. Though depending on when the recording device is turned on I may have to define a starting point (though I may quite easily do that out of matlab, deleting however many seconds from the beginning).
You don't have to guess what to put into MATLAB functions, the MATLAB help is top notch and shows you exactly what you should put in. You can always type `help functionname` and get information, or search for it online. Although, I am confused. [`kstest` only takes a single vector input](https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/kstest.html?requestedDomain=www.mathworks.com), and it's the input you're imagining. Perhaps you're looking at [`kstest2`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/kstest2.html) which compares two distributions? 
So would I be able to put two probability distribution objects into kstest2? edit: Tried it and it seems to be working (well, it is returning a value) but when I compare it to the kernel function of my data, all of the distributions I'm testing return 0, and when I compare them to just my raw data, everything returns 1. That seems wrong, since on the graph of all the pdfs, 2 of the distributions looked very close to the data and the other 2 were pretty clearly off.
How do you even know what the meaning is of the number it returns? Why not just read the documentation that explains all of this? 
the Stats toolbox should have some functions for sampling from different distributions. if you don't have that toolbox, i'm sure there are some functions on File Exchange. you can also use the Inverse Transform Sampling method to sample from any CDF: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling the basic idea here is you map a uniform random number between 0 and 1 (Matlab's "rand" function) to a different distribution using that distribution's CDF. 
There's no good way without manually adding spaces that I know of, create a matrix and just leave out the semicolon or print the matrix. Edit: not matrix, cell array 
This might be what you're looking for. pad is applied based on the longest element in the array, I'd prefer if it could just be applied per column. You'll need 16b or newer. nums = [1 2 3 pi; 5 6 7 8]; titles = ["Total Income($)" "Income Tax($)" "Medicare Levy($)" "Total Tax($)"]; values = [compose("%7.0f", nums(:,1)) compose("%5.2f", nums(:,2:4))]; result = [titles; values]; result = pad(result,'left'); result = join(result); fprintf('%s\n', result); &gt;&gt; myScript Total Income($) Income Tax($) Medicare Levy($) Total Tax($) 1 2.00 3.00 3.14 5 6.00 7.00 8.00
Thank you, it worked!
Just use Python. Goddamn.
It's for a university course in which I am required to program in MATLAB
I'm not sure what you mean when you say &gt; it is very inefficient as I'm using the function ~10 times and with recurring vertices You mean manually writing it is a pain because you're having to rewrite it 10 times? Or it's computationally inefficient because you're clearing and re-plotting 10 times? The code you posted doesn't loop and creates two patches, so I can't tell what you mean. I'm guessing you're saying it's manually inefficient because of the `...` in your code. You can re-use points the same way you're calling it now - with the `'Faces'` input. Right now you're creating all of your points, and then just linearly indexing all of them. You can make every facet in one patch object. You can make a million things in one patch object. Patch is pretty awesome. *[From the documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/patch.html)*, which is where you should always start when you have a question about using a function, &gt; `patch('Faces',F,'Vertices',V)` creates one or more polygons where `V` specifies vertex values and `F` defines which vertices to connect. Specifying only unique vertices and their connection matrix can reduce the size of the data when there are many polygons. Specify one vertex per row in `V`. To create one polygon, specify `F` as a vector. To create multiple polygons, specify `F` as a matrix with one row per polygon. Each face does not have to have the same number of vertices. To specify different numbers of vertices, pad `F` with NaN values. So, to reiterate for emphasis: 1. `V` specifies vertex values. 2. To create multiple polygons, specify `F` as a matrix with one row per polygon. 3. `F` defines which vertices to connect. 4. Each face does not have to have the same number of vertices. To specify different numbers of vertices, pad `F` with NaN values. Make a matrix that has all of your vertex values for the entire shape, then make the faces by choosing the appropriate vertices. `F` can be as big as you want it. 
What do you mean with "the whole signal just shifts"?
Hello! So, there’s no such thing as ‘most accurate’ condition when evaluating if statements. In fact, there are only conditions that are either evaluated as true or false and therefore will trigger, or not, the execution of the subsequent instructions, in this case down to the first end. Using your example (1100), I’ll go through your code: 1. Is it lower than 5000? No, so jump to first instruction after the first end. 2. Is it, at the same time, greater or equal to 5000 and lower than 10000? No, so jump to next if statement . 3. Is it greater or equal to 10000? Yes! So execute all instructions prior to the subsequent end. In the end rate=0.15 not because it is the ‘most accurate’ condition you’ve set, but because it is actually the only one that is true. I’ve also answered your second question: yes the order matters indeed.
Have you tried just using the real fft function? I think it might be fftr or rfft or something. There are not negative frequencies in the output
Instead of having half the signal, ie the positive frequencies plotted, the whole signal (which is mirrored around zero) shifts. Essentially there's just a change in x-axis values.
No, I haven't - I'll give it a go! Thanks
Just out of interest, why are you using numerical integration at all if you a doing a polyfit? Sure, Simpson rule on a quadratic polynomial works but you have the polynomial coefficients from the polyfit so why not directly calculate an analytic integral from that. Or is Simpson rule required by your exercise?
Edit: nevermind, i misread quartic as quadratic With regard to your last point, isn’t it irrelevant how many steps they use? Their function is a quadratic polynomial and Simpson’s rule fits quadratic polynomials to the intervals if I’m not mistaken. So even the smallest interval with just three points should capture the integral perfectly. 
If you change only the f vector's values you are just shifting it to the right, like you said. If I understood what you want to do (eliminate the negative part of the signal) what you have to do is remove from the signal (and from the f vector later) the first half of values. What you can do is: Newsignal=oldsignal(length(oldsignal) /2:length(oldsignal)) ; And something similar for f
To expand on that, code evaluates top to bottom. An if statement always operates if the condition is true. If multiple if statements are true, all code within each true section is evaluated. Finally, a variable that is already defined will simply be redefined if it is set equal to something else. Thus, it will be equal to the last thing it was set equal to. If it is defined scores multiple true if statements, the most recent will be the value.
Have a look at [this](https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fft.html) and how the single sided spectrum is calculated.
Why do you want to remove negative frequencies? In many cases, all you want to do is plot only the positive frequencies, like muluman88 suggests, since the negative frequencies (of a real signal) are just the complex conjugate of the positive ones. If you remove the negative frequencies, and ifft back, you will now have a complex signal instead of a real one.
You can use printf syntax like "% 7.0f" to have it add spaces.
thank you! However, I think I realized my actual question looking back at the code. For the statement: end if bal &gt;= 5000 &amp; bal &lt; 10000 What if we didn't have '&amp; bal &lt; 10000' ? Would the output still be the same, or in this case would we have to check for greatest value, second greatest value, and third greatest value? Also, in the similar scenario, we can't have 'switch' statements with cases like 'bal &gt;= 5000 &amp; bal &lt; 10000'? The 'case' in a switch statement can only compare to one value right (say 'case 5' or case '1' but no 'case &lt;5')? And that's when an 'if' would be used instead?
Assign the variable to the next index. 
First of all, your definition of q is wrong. Second, it's not clear what you mean. q = [0 q 4];
import(‘filename’) I think works? I like to use uiimport. Just type that into the command line. Then you can open the file of choice. It has a GUI where you can choose what to import. You can import the data or have Matlab make a script or function to import the data. If it’s a one time thing just import the data. When I first learned this, I was importing test data. We had 70+ data sheets, so I needed to do it often. I had Matlab make a function that I could loop through. Super convenient command.
 help textscan
Ok... this question comes up all the time. I'm assuming you're txt file as a something separated file. Put the file in your current working directory. Then matlab has an import function (top menu). There it will give you a walk through. What columns. How it's separated etc. You can then select if you want matlab to import the data or create a function for you so you can import it at run time.
Just so you know, I'm not downvoting you because I dislike python; I'm downvoting you because this a stupid, misleading, and counterproductive comment. 
Of course you can, it will be a different serial port
I haven't used GAs or PSOs for object detection, but have used those algorithms in the past. Do you have the code for the PSO or just the algorithm? If you have the code, it should be pretty easy to convert it to a GA. Basically the "location vector" for your PSO is equivalent to an individuals' genes in the GA. The main difference comes in how you generate new candidate solutions. In PSO you look calculate a "velocity" vector to update the locations (based off the best solution the particle has seen, the best solution the swarm has seen, and the previous velocity); in the GA you're going to essentially take two candidates and create a new one through some genetic reproduction. There are lots of different ways of doing this, but the easiest is to simply find a "crossover" point that determines where the split occurs, something like: numGenes = length(genes); crossoverPoint = floor(rand*numGenes); newPopulationMember(1:crossoverPoint) = parent1Genes(1:crossoverPoint); newPopulationMember(crossoverPoint+1:end) = parent2Genes(crossoverPoint+1:end) That should get you started...Take a look here for more info: http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/w.langdon/ftp/papers/poli08_fieldguide.pdf 
I should have added, that specifics on how you implement the GA or PSO really depend on the data structures you're using. For example, you could be simply using a matrix that's size (number particles/members) x (number of genes), with an associated vector of their scores. Alternatively, you could be using a structure where each element of the structure represents a particle/member, and has fields "location/genes" and "score". Either way, I'd suggest playing around with randomly selecting from a population, both in an unweighted and weighted manner.
First of all, the error message just means that the script was working on that line when you pressed Ctrl+C. That in turn means that your calls to func need a lot of time. Not knowing that function nor the values you hand to them I can just give a few ideas on top of my head.. a) Are those inputs vectors and maybe pretty large? b) Does that function allocate matrices? Be careful, zeros(x) translates to zeros(x,x) while you may want zeros(x,1)
Try printing the error value and pausing to see if it ever goes down to what you expect?? Since that is the only exit point for your function, that should give you some idea where the problem is
I don't really want to 'remove' them per se, I am just trying to get a single-sided fft. Which I now have but I've just realised that the frequency values have been shifted by one, closer to zero. I'm sure that's really easy to fix but I'm fairly new to matlab. 
Above is most likely correct. Screen outputs can be slow so an alternative is just put a counter on it with a max iteration control to exit your while loop. This is good practice any time you are setting up a loop like this.
Hello again! &gt;What if we didn't have '&amp; bal &lt; 10000' ? Would the output still be the same, or in this case would we have to check for greatest value, second greatest value, and third greatest value? So, as correctly suggested by /u/Fenr-i-r is his comment [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/74t89g/i_would_just_like_to_confirm_an_idea_of_mine/do186rg/), the final output would be the same. This is because the 'rate' variable will be updated two times and it will be set to equal to 0.15 the second time. &gt;Also, in the similar scenario, we can't have 'switch' statements with cases like 'bal &gt;= 5000 &amp; bal &lt; 10000'? The 'case' in a switch statement can only compare to one value right (say 'case 5' or case '1' but no 'case &lt;5')? And that's when an 'if' would be used instead? I confirm that it is only possible to check for equality in a switch case statement; therefore yes, to check for inequalities it is mandatory to use if statements. I would like to forward you to the MATLAB Documentation pages regarding [if statements](https://it.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/if.html) and the use of [switch](https://it.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/switch.html). I learnt to write MATLAB codes basically all by myself and I managed to build up my knowledge on the subject quite quickly as soon as I realised how useful the provided Documentation actually is. (In the end my Master's Thesis work turned out to be a huge MATLAB program, so I would sa that is not a bad method to learn :) ) Therefore, I would like to suggest you to exploit it every time you are in need.
Thank you!
+1 on MATLAB documentation being awesome. Great way to learn programming. In brief, what was your masters program? I'm submitting my masters thesis (UAV Geophysics) in 10 hours time :)
Nuclear Engineering. Is that short enough? :) I worked on edged magnetic turbulence in a [tokamak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak); short version: I did lost of statistical data analysis. I have one more exam to go and my thesis to submit as well. Good luck whit your defence man! :)
Oh nice! That's probably as brief as it needs to be. Good luck to you to!
A few notes 1) take the time to actually look at the example in the assignment. Specifically look at what the inputs to freqz are. Then look at your code. Does it look right? If your still not sure, type "help freqz" and read through the help. Better yet, look at the [online documentation for freqz](https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/freqz.html) 2) your "w" variables input ranges from 0 to 45*pi, 66*pi, or 105*pi for the 3 cases you show. I can almost guarantee you that is wrong. On a side note: questions like this get downvoted and arent answered because when 1) you dont follow the example that was given to you and 2) you dont consult the help system (which is usually pretty fantastic in matlab) then people justifiably feel that if your not willing to try and figure it out then they shouldnt take the time to help you. This sub is a great place to get help, but it is not a place to have other people do your homework for you. If you carefully look at all available examples and read the help and documentation pages for all the functions you want to use (including looking at / trying the examples that are included with literally every online documentation entry), and you STILL cant figure it out, then come back and ask and you will almost certainly get people willing to help you out.
My understanding is that matlab passes by reference unless you attempt to write, at which point it creates a new copy. Also look into the `handle` class.
That would be nice. I was under the impression that didnt happen, though I admit I didnt google this aspect immediately before writing this post, so I could be mistaken. I'll have to look into this and run some tests to confirm.
See this [question](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/152-can-matlab-pass-by-reference), specifically &gt; If instead you are attempting to use pass-by-reference to avoid unnecessary copying of data into the workspace of the function you're calling, you should be aware that MATLAB uses a system commonly called "copy-on-write" to avoid making a copy of the input argument inside the function workspace until or unless you modify the input argument. If you do not modify the input argument, MATLAB will avoid making a copy. Note that you can force somewhat pointer-like behavior by wrapping your data in a class deriving from [`handle`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/copying-objects.html).
Yep, thats definitely the case, though I still see a few situations where this doesnt work well (namely, when you want to replace a but dont need to modify many values). Ill have to look more at the method you describe for forcing pointer-like behavior. seems like it might be useful in some situations.
First of all you should use fplot, as it is recommended in the doc page. Anyway it works pretty much how you would expect. syms x c c = 1:10; fplot( sin(c*x) ); This will plot all versions of sin(c*x) for the default interval of fplot. 
thats alright, i dont really care for downvotes, more that i figured someone would offer an example for freqz instead of just saying look up help when its usually the first thing someone usually does.
Using the symbolic toolbox for this is unneccesary. I do not understand why so many people try to use it for stuff like this. Just do something like: x = -5:5; c = 1:10; plot(x, c.'*x); Where you make easy use of matlab's implicit expansion.
Thank you, I guess instead of the variable “a” y use “b” or something else for the other arduino 
But... It's Matlab. I thought everything was supposed to be symbolic. ^^/s
Yeah, it's required by the question. I think my whole issue came from believing that the example layout of the question's results were the correct answers, since they were extremely close to what I got as my own answers.
You can also achieve psuedo-gobal behavior by stashing variables in the root figure's appdata--it at least hides it from things like `clear all`. But generally it's better to use handle classes if you need to pass by reference, and to rely on the default copy-on-write (with awareness of how it's used so you doubt accidentally force copying when not necessary). 
&gt; it will take forever to make new x vectors (x2, x3, x4) specifically for the y vectors if I were to go about removing the NaN values No, it wont. x1_new = x(~isnan(y1)); y1_new = y1(~isnan(y1)); Repeat for each case of y.
If it does not stop, what does that mean? Which parts of the code might get stuck in an infinite loop? What can you do to debug this? Hint: tolerance
You could even one-line it, if you wanted to: [polyfitOutputs] = polyfit(... x(~isnan(y)) , ... y(~isnan(y)) , ... n); 
I have no computer nearby at the moment, but I guess this would work as long as you have 0.2, 0.3 and 0.5 values in `xfft` fff(xfft == 0.2) [dir](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/dir.html) and [dlmread](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/dlmread.html) will help you automate the process.
If x (e.g 0.4) is in your vector xfft, then the following line should give you the power at that value px=abs(fff(xfft==x)) I can imagine though that this value won't be flush in your vector, but rather something a little bit off, like 0.3997 or similar. In that case, if you can live with the uncertainty, then the following lines should give you the value closest to your desired x: px=abs(fff(abs(xfft-x)==min(abs(xfft-x)))
A=dir('C\...\myfolder') B=A(3:end) for i = 1:length(B) load([B(1).folder '\' B(1).name]) mycode . . . filenames{i,1}=[B(i).folder '\' B(i).name] hz2(i,1)=abs(fff('index at .2')) hz4(i,1)=abs(fff('index at .4')) hz5(i,1)=abs(fff('index at .5')) clearvars -except B C end T=(filenames,hz2,hz4,hz5)
Someone recommended me to use finite over ~isnan, but I can't remember why. 
Assuming you mean "isfinite" that function will work with both NaN and Inf values. But this case seemed specific to NaN so I figured that function was the best bet. 
You can figure this out pretty easily with a quick Google. I believe there's a decent Wikipedia page on the topic. Either way, it's a math question, not a Matlab question. 
As /u/FrickinLazerBeams said, not a Matlab question. I'll help you out, though - 1. Get the equation of the line. 2. Get the negative reciprocal of the slope of the equation from (1) to find the slope of a line that is *perpendicular*. 3. Find the equation of a line that passes through the arbitrary point and has the slope from (2). 4. Find the intersection of the line equation from (1) and the line equation from (3). 5. Check that the intersection is within the bounds of the ends of the line segment. If it's is, you're done. If not, then you get the end point. If you're trying this in 3D, you can still write the function for 2D, then pass in the x/y plane and then the x/z plane, etc. Should all work. 
If you write this using vector formalism, it won't matter how many dimensions are in the problem. The code to do this in 10 dimensions looks the same as in 2.
 num = -5+10*rand(1) if num &lt; 0 num = num*-1 x = sqrt (num) else x = sqrt(num) end 
By the way...based on your post history...looks like a chegg subscription is the best $15 a month you will probably ever spend.
Maybe, but how do you find a line perpendicular in [seven dimensions](https://youtu.be/BKorP55Aqvg)?

this is so embarrassingly simple i'm not really sure what to tell you. have you ever coded a single thing in your life? have you ever used a scientific calculator?
Join link doesn't work.
Try removing the nfft2 part, and just use fft(motion,nfft). The power of 2 part is used to optimize in terms of speed, not accuracy. You're essentially zero padding your signal, which causes leakage in the spectogram.
Or a more advanced trick: the value of nfft determines resolution. Rather than zero-padding till the next power of two, consider zero-padding in a way that results in exact values at your desired 0.4Hz, 0.2Hz, and 0.5Hz.
Thanks for all your help everyone! I wasn't expecting so many quick replies. Before seeing the replies I actually went with I actually went with: PowerAtPoint4 = interp1(xfft,abs(fff),0.4); PowerAtPoint2 = interp1(xfft,abs(fff),0.2); PowerAtPoint05 = interp1(xfft,abs(fff),0.05); I need to fix my code so I will check out all the suggestions. I am not using any for loops so its the same thing copy-pasted 30 times, very inelegant!
No, based on the post history they should change majors. If they can't be bothered to do the basics, talk to professors *use a subreddit called cheat at math homework to [post basic questions with zero effort](https://www.reddit.com/r/cheatatmathhomework/comments/7355xz/i_need_help_with_a_question/)*, then what are they even in school for. Cheating at high school... I guess I can kind of understand. It's compulsory, with generally not much leeway with regards to what you're required to take for core curriculum, and honestly math isn't everyone's cup of tea. But college? Wtf man you're paying for the classes. If you don't like the subject matter, *nobody is forcing you to go*. Change majors. Or drop out! Quitting is **always** an option. For fuck's sake though, don't cheat your way through college and then go on to design my buildings. 
Please don't do homework for people on this sub. 
No problem
I believe you could do this with a polyfit https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/polyfit.html?requestedDomain=www.mathworks.com
Do you have 'cftool'? I sometimes use that if I want a nice GUI for curve fitting. It definitely has an exponential fit option. 
The interactive fitting tool will most certainly let you select an exponential fit type, but a more basic approach can be seen [here](https://www.mathworks.com/examples/curvefitting/mw/curvefit-ex72685292-fit-exponential-models-using-the-fit-function). Cheers!
cftool opens a window but how do I write my points or chose exponential?
This solved the exponential problem, thanks.
This worked but doesnt work with exponential
[polynomials](https://www.mathworks.com/examples/curvefitting/mw/curvefit-ex51446901-fit-polynomials-using-the-fit-function?s_tid=examples_p1_Topic) are pretty much the same.
It's actually not easily possible to use two colormaps. It is possible but it requires some workaround. [See this discussion, they answer your problem there](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/101346-how-do-i-use-multiple-colormaps-in-a-single-figure). It is easiest to simply concatenate multiple colormaps into one, then map each plot to a section of the colormap. However, in your case using 3D plots, the only solution is to plot each function on a separate axes, apply each color map to each axis handle, then link the two axes together.
I've never used fsurf before, but worst case scenario you could use "surf" instead, and go off this example: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/surf.html#bvgs7ws-1 "surf" uses the matrices (z-data, color data) and vectors (x and y values), so you'd need to discretize those functions over the domain of interest as opposed to using the "function" approach.
I'd probably do something dumb like put each letters binary representation into separate strings, concatenate them, and then str2num. 
join(string(Z), ''); And if you want to covert that to double char(bitstring) -'0';
Hey Thanks, that worked : )
My pleasure.
Not sure if it really helps with your problem, but for plotting two different variables on one graph you can use `plotyy` or `hold on`, `plot3` will allow you to make an x, y, z plot. It seems to me your question is more about statistics and finding a new variable that's representative of your inputs.
Plotyy OR yyaxis (the newer, better version) is probably what you're looking for.
The fit function will do this. doc fit Or you can do it the old fashioned manual way by plotting the exponential of your function and fitting a linear line.
It looks like that's for two dependent variables and one independent. I'm looking for the opposite where my one output is reliant on two inputs.
I see, something like plotxx (it doesn't exist)? I have no experience of that unfortunately.
From my limited understanding of the data at hand, an xyz chart seems to be the way to go. So plot3 would be the solution in that case. 
Alright, thanks regardless!
scatter3
It's hard to see, but Matlab documentation has the dependent vector as a *column* vector. On mobile, so can't test it myself, but try Time = [10 5 10 5 5 10 5 10].'; (With the transpose at the end) 
Does it make a figure? Save the figure. 
Thanks for the reply. I just tried transposing the Time vector and I'm still getting the full rank error though :/
Did you try doing a 2-way measure anova? It could also be that you don't have enough data to support a 3-way anova. I'd try making some fake data to see if it works, something like: SubjectID_new = [1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 7 8 8] Phase_new = [1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2] Sex_new = [1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2] Time_new = [10 5 10 5 5 10 5 10 10 5 10 5 5 10 5 10] 
You don't have enough data to support an ANOVA test
Everything in Matlab is an array. For example the number 1 is a 1x1 array in Matlab. [ and ] are the concatenate commands, they assemble arrays together. So by doing: x = [1 2 3]; You concatenate 3 arrays (of size 1x1) into a single (1x3) array. [y 0] Does the same thing, it concatenates the array y (1x2) and 0 (1x1) in to a (1x3) array. By doing this, the second argument in the plot command is the same size as the first argument and it can be plotted.
I always use [export_fig](https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export-fig) to save figures as pngs. 
Welcome to the *Matlab* subreddit. Maybe you're looking for the [TI Calculator subreddit?](https://www.reddit.com/r/TI_Calculators/comments/75w5z5/need_help_with_normalcdf/). (I linked to your post in that subreddit.)
That's a good point. Maybe I should have mentioned that this is a fake data set to illustrate the issue I'm having (my real data set is much bigger). However, I've managed to produce a more compact version of my real data set with the above vectors and they replicate the same error I'm getting with my real (larger) data set.
Thanks! I have tried a 2-way anova and it does actually work (if I exclude sex as an independent variable, but even a 2-way anova won't work if I include sex). The problem is that I need to analyze sex differences with this data.
I have a very, very, very hacky solution...I think: %% Hacked-together solution to the color maps [X,Y] = meshgrid(linspace(-5,5,50)); Z1 = X.^2; Z2 = X.^2 + Y.^2; CM1 = winter; CM2 = spring; CM = [CM1;CM2]; figure(1);clf;hold on % We will map all of Z1 to [1,2] and Z2 to [0,1] Z1_scale = ( Z1 - min(Z1(:)) ) ./ ( max(Z1(:)) - min(Z1(:)) ) + 1+eps; % Add a little Z2_scale = ( Z2 - min(Z2(:)) ) ./ ( max(Z2(:)) - min(Z2(:)) ); surf(X,Y,Z1,Z1_scale) surf(X,Y,Z2,Z2_scale) colormap(CM) %% Uses palette.m which is my own code. See: % https://gist.github.com/Jwink3101/cb2bf18a1a9ad010648e1ffbf0221209 figure(2) subplot(1,2,1) palette(CM1,'-vert','-no-label') set(gca,'ytick',linspace(0,1,10)) set(gca,'yticklabels',linspace(min(Z1(:)),max(Z1(:)),10)) subplot(1,2,2) palette(CM2,'-vert','-no-label') set(gca,'ytick',linspace(0,1,10)) set(gca,'yticklabels',linspace(min(Z2(:)),max(Z2(:)),10)) As noted in the code, for the colorbars, you can use my [`palette.m`](https://gist.github.com/Jwink3101/cb2bf18a1a9ad010648e1ffbf0221209) code
This might get you started in the rigth direction. Here seq is the sequence in the experiment, and test is a set of cuts for which you want to see if they are the first several cuts in said experiement. seq = 'ABEDC' test = 'ABD' whenCut = any(repmat(seq,numel(test),1)==test',1) seqIsGoodForTest = all(find(whenCut)==1:numel(test)) 
You need to set your time vector. it's as easy as: Fs = 100; t = 0:1/Fs:20; Fs is your sampling frequency (how many datapoints you want to have each second). This will produce a linearly spaced vector t from 0 to 20 with a step size of 1/Fs between datapoints. You'll likely run into some matrix multiplication errors though, because you'll be multiplying your time vector (a matrix) by another matrix in some of those operations. For example, a = 2*t*exp(t); will give you an error because the t and exp(t) terms both evaluate to matrices. To fix this, simply put a '.' in front of the multiplication operator to denote element-wise multiplication: a = 2*t.*exp(t)
&gt; I get an error message saying that 't' isn't defined. How do I fix this? Define `t`. &gt; I'm not sure how to set it to [0,20]. t = 0:20;
if you want your time vector t to be evenly spaced time you should add t = linspace(0,20,1000); This will give you 1000 evenly spaced points between 0 and 20. You'll then notice that Matlab can't multiply vectors together unless instructed to do it element-wise so substitute all your * with .* in your equations for x, v, and a where it is trying to multiply a vector with a vector. Do the same for ^ and / so they look like x=(-4+4*t).*(exp(1)).^(-0.4*t); v=-((8*t-26).*(exp(1).^(-0.4*t)))/5; a=((16*t-92).*(exp(1).^(-0.4*x)))/25;
So there is nothing to optimize, right? You just need a function with two output argument. Look for help on functions.
Just assign values to all the constants m_1 = 1; R1 = 5; etc. And then just assign whatever value you need to x. Then just write the equation out in matlab. c1 = ((m1*r1 + m2*r1 = m3*r3)*g + (x*g*r1) ) / (k1*b1) And then the same for c2. If needed you can also make a function for this. where you just input x and returns 2 answers. Read [this](https://mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/function.html) on how to do so.
I seee, thats essentially what i was looking for, so it would return two answers, i appreciate your time. 
Can you be more specific for what issues you are having? You can always multiplex complex numbers as a 2x1 vector if needed
How does your transfer function have complex numbers?
Easier to code it and comment the code than to try to explain it with words. Coding is like words that do things, right? clear; clc; % Get the path to the file filePath = 'D:\testData.txt'; % Load the file fileID = fopen(filePath); if fileID &lt; 0 fprintf('File not found at path\n%s\n',filePath) end fileData = fread(fileID,'*char'); fclose(fileID); % Standardize the line breaks; sometimes a pain rawFileData = strrep(fileData.',char(13),newline).'; % Break the data on new lines to strip out the headers rawFileData = strsplit(rawFileData.',newline).'; headers = rawFileData{1}; % File data is now everything except the headers fileData = rawFileData(2:end); % Check if the last line is empty (should be trimmed) testString = fileData(end); if isempty(testString) fileData = fileData(1:end-1); end % Setup the processing for this specific case numberWidth(1) = 4; numberWidth(2) = 8; currentPos = 0; % widthSelector is basically just a toggle because there are two options widthSelector = false; % Basically, I'll convert the data to a CSV.

Briefly, like the comments say, I convert the file to a CSV by inserting columns of commas in alternating 4/8 width locations, then once that's done I strip all of the spaces out. At that point, you just read it like a CSV. This is tailored for you from some file loading scripts I wrote ages ago (and use daily) &lt;3
The values of `q` are insignificant comparing to the values of `heat`. min(q) = 5.6281e-13 max(q) = 4.6901e-06 min(heat) = 73.0710 max(heat) = 83.8600 Therefore, in the scope of `heat`, `q+73` looks like a straight line.
The code has been found: feature('HotLinks',0); This code disables hyperlinks in the console (and also removes bold from the table headers, for some reason). To re-enable, use feature('HotLinks',1);
Thank you!! I figured it out--my density (rho) was in g/cm^3 and it needed to be converted to kg/m^3 to be significant.
+ That's awesome. Cool solution. Thank you. It mostly works except that I don't always have the same number of 4 char/8 char pairings. It's usually 5 pairs per line but it can be less. It hiccups at: charArray = cell2mat(fileData); That's on me. I didn't phrase my problem properly. I'll go through your code a little more and see if I can refine it to accommodate lines with fewer pairings (unless you want to spoon-feed me that, too). Thanks.
 testSequence{1} = 'ABCDE'; testSequence{2} = 'ABEBC'; testSequence{3} = 'AEBCD'; testSequence{4} = 'ABEDABE'; desiredSection = 'ABE'; sectionPerms = perms(desiredSection); for currentSequence = 1:numel(testSequence) for currentPerm = 1:size(sectionPerms,1) location = strfind(... testSequence{currentSequence}, ... sectionPerms(currentPerm,:)); if ~isempty(location) for currentLocale = 1:numel(location) fprintf(['Section %s found in sequence %d at '... 'location %d.\n'], ... sectionPerms(currentPerm,:), ... currentSequence, ... location(currentLocale)); end end end end
Yeah sure I can spoon feed lol... brb
Awesome! So from that point I will probably use the location array to pick out which sequences from the separate outcome matrix (let's call it Angle) and compare using ANOVA. So I would probably do: anovagroup=Angle(location,1:length(desiredSection) [h,p]=anova1(Angle) Does that work?
If I run Matlab without gui `matlab -nodesktop` the bold headings are gone together with tags inside diary file. The output doesn't show the size of the table. I'm using Matlab 8.2.0.701 (R2013b) on GNU/Linux.
Okay, here you go. There are two spots to fix - first, you need to pad the rows such that they are all of a uniform width. This is done immediately before the `charArray = cell2mat(fileData)` line (don't worry I'll repost the whole corrected code. maxWidth = 0; for currentRow = 1:numel(fileData) if numel(fileData{currentRow})&gt;maxWidth maxWidth = numel(fileData{currentRow}); end end for currentRow = 1:numel(fileData) fileData{currentRow} = [fileData{currentRow}, ... repmat(' ',1,maxWidth - numel(fileData{currentRow}))]; end Then, later, when you're trying to perform the `textscan`, you need to have an extra comma if the whole thing ends in a comma, because Matlab only reads a formatted character if it exists *between* delimiters. If there the last entry is `NaN`, then you need an extra delimiter to sandwich it. Otherwise you get the last line as being one entry short and then the operation fails when you try to go `cell2mat` at the end. % Matlab doesn't recognize an entry with textscan if it's not *between* % two delimiters, and there's no newline at the end of the data, so % append an extra comma if one's missing to force textscan to read the % last line correctly. if isequal(usefulData(end),',') disp('Comma Inserted!') usefulData(end+1) = ','; end The completed output here will insert `NaN` entries into your columns where there is no data. This should be, IMO, the desired effect. If you have spaces in your column those also should be correctly converted to `NaN` values. Here's the complete corrected code: clear; clc; % Get the path to the file filePath = 'D:\testData.txt'; % Load the file fileID = fopen(filePath); if fileID &lt; 0 fprintf('File not found at path\n%s\n',filePath) end fileData = fread(fileID,'*char'); fclose(fileID); % Standardize the line breaks; sometimes a pain rawFileData = strrep(fileData.',char(13),newline).'; % Break the data on new lines to strip out the headers rawFileData = strsplit(rawFileData.',newline).'; headers = rawFileData{1}; % File data is now everything except the headers fileData = rawFileData(2:end); % Check if the last line is empty (should be trimmed) testString = fileData(end); if isempty(testString{:}) fileData = fileData(1:end-1); end % Setup the processing for this specific case numberWidth(1) = 4; numberWidth(2) = 8; currentPos = 0; % widthSelector is basically just a toggle because there are two options widthSelector = false; % Basically, I'll convert the data to a CSV. Watch. % The loop is there because I'm assuming the sample data was.. a sample. % The loop should allow for an arbitrarily wide set of data that follows % the pattern. maxWidth = 0; for currentRow = 1:numel(fileData) if numel(fileData{currentRow})&gt;maxWidth maxWidth = numel(fileData{currentRow}); end end for currentRow = 1:numel(fileData) fileData{currentRow} = [fileData{currentRow}, ... repmat(' ',1,maxWidth - numel(fileData{currentRow}))]; end charArray = cell2mat(fileData); nRows = size(charArray, 1); nCols = 1; while true % Set the current width currentWidth = numberWidth(widthSelector+1); % Setup for the next width widthSelector = ~widthSelector; % Break at the current position + the width of the current number breakPoint = currentPos + currentWidth; % Insert a column of commas to build up a CSV charArray = [... charArray(:,1:breakPoint), ... repmat(',', nRows,1), ... charArray(:, breakPoint + 1:end)]; % Increment the current position currentPos = breakPoint + 1; % Increment the number of columns nCols = nCols + 1; if (currentPos + numberWidth(widthSelector+1)) &gt;= size(charArray,2) break; end end % Now that commas have been inserted in the appropriate places, rejoin the % data usefulData = char(strjoin(string(charArray),newline)); % Remove the spaces used for width padding now - almost done! while true dataSize = numel(usefulData); usefulData = strrep(usefulData,' ',''); if dataSize == numel(usefulData) break; end end % Matlab doesn't recognize an entry with textscan if it's not *between* % two delimiters, and there's no newline at the end of the data, so % append an extra comma if one's missing to force textscan to read the % last line correctly. if isequal(usefulData(end),',') disp('Comma Inserted!') usefulData(end+1) = ','; end % Build up the search string parseString = repmat('%f ', 1, nCols); % Setup delimiters - you're now looking through raw CSV data delimiters = {',',newline}; % Read the data outputData = textscan(usefulData, parseString, 'Delimiter', delimiters); % Convert from a cell array to a matrix. finalOutput = cell2mat(outputData); % Display results! disp('File input:'); disp(rawFileData); disp('Processed output:'); disp(headers) disp(finalOutput);
I mean, this finds the locations for you. **NOTE** that the location value is overwritten each iteration. I don't know what you're planning to do with the results; this just finds the locations. Honestly speaking, statistical analysis is beyond my comfort zone, so that bit is up to you :P

Did you try [this](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/51165-matlab-file-association-fix)?
yeah, you do suck a coding. this shit is basic calculator syntax.
Seems like you suck at being human so i win... yeah.
I'll try it out sometime, thanks! It's interesting that it also doesn't output the table size.
There's no table size in output when running with GUI too. I guess we're using different versions of Matlab.
That could be it. I just use what my school gives me, so I'm unsure of the version.
there are probably more elegant ways of doing this, but I'd try to parse out the the number form the file name using a strfind, assuming "X" and "r" can be different lengths. something like: for k = 1:numImages currentFileName = allFileNames{k}; dashLocs = strfind(currentFileName,'--'); jpgLoc = strfind(currentFileName,'.jpg') numVec(k) = str2num(currentFileName(1:dashLocs(1)-1)); xVec(k) = currentFileName(dashLocs(1)+2:dashLocs(2)-1); rVec(k) = currentFileName(dashLocs(2)+2, jpgLoc(1)-1); end You should be able to find the "allFileNames" using the dir command: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/dir.html After that loop, the numVec can be compared with your other list (possibly using setdiff). 
You could use [dir](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/dir.html) to populate a list of the file names in the folder, and then [strfind](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/strfind.html) to compare the file names to your token? Alternatively, you can call ‘dir ###*’ and look for filenames in the current directory that match ### with some junk afterwards. You would need to either specify which directory to look in or change the current directory to the folder beforehand with [cd](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/cd.html?s_tid=doc_ta).
MATLAB isn't open software...
A very lazy way to get the time interval would use. xlim ([0 20]); %for t interval 0 -&gt;20 ylim ([0 20]); %for x interval 0-&gt;20 % use hold on hold off as necessary 
Nice find! [The function is undocumented](http://undocumentedmatlab.com/blog/undocumented-feature-function).
Yes, I know. That doesn't mean one should give up and fall in bed with MS.

It works like any other if statement in a different language, you use the [equality](https://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/eq.html) function. if( Y(4,1) == X(49395,1)) Your code here. end
You can take the times and convert them to "date numbers" while specifying the format. I can't really tell what your date strings are representing though, so I'm guessing it's year-month followed by... days.minutes? But maybe you're using Julian days (also apparently called [ordinal dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_date)) and hours and minutes - anyways, the point is *I can't tell what your decimal bits mean but you can tell Matlab with a format string.* yourStr = '2016-05 1.81'; yourNum = datenum(yourStr, 'yyyy-mm HH.MM'); yourDate = datestr(yourNum); Again, I've formatted it year-month hours.minutes. Use `doc datenum` and click on the `formatIn` to see how it's expecting the format string - capitalization matters! If your time strings flip-flop in the same file, you can use `try` and `catch` blocks to convert the time. Try it with one format string, and if `datenum` can't convert it the process fails. When it fails, you can put another `datenum` attempt using the other format string in the `catch` block. Again - `doc try` is the way to read more. Hope that helps!
**Ordinal date** An ordinal date is a calendar date typically consisting of a year and a day of year ranging between 1 and 366 (starting on January 1), though year may sometimes be omitted. The two numbers can be formatted as YYYY-DDD to comply with the ISO 8601 ordinal date format. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/matlab/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27

Np :D
Thanks. My matlab is complaining at this line: [str, sign] = split(str,["-" "+"]); Error: Creating a string using double quotes is not supported. Use the string function. Is it my version of matlab or something? I'm on R2016b.

Thank you will try that! :)
you can use matlab magic: prod(reshape(matrix,2,numel(matrix)/2))
Wouldn't it be easier to do: A(1:2:end) .* A(2:2:end) I'd argue that is cleaner code
R2016b doesn't have double quotes. You can use string('-') in place of "-".
First, please do try to share your code. It shows, if nothing else, that you've tried, and people are more willing to help someone who has tried. Second, are your time instants exactly the same? As in, they'd pass the `==` test? Or are they just close to the same? If they are exactly the same, look at `unique` and especially the third output `ic` (try `doc unique`if you're unsure of the outputs of `unique`). That will give you the locations of repeated times. 
+Which also works gloriously. Thank you. 
What? I can't understand what you're saying. Consider: &gt; I have is a very long matrix Okay &gt; The columns [include a] time instant (|t|) Okay &gt; I may also have no value for a given time instant Not possible. You have something for a given time instant, or you don't have a matrix. Do you mean cell array with an empty cell? Do you mean there's a *zero* for the time instant? Do you mean there's an `NaN` for the time instant? Because you have something there. But regardless, continuing on: &gt; I'm trying to write a code that finds rows with the same time instant and then makes a mean out of them. Makes a mean out of *what*? You want the mean of multiple identical numbers? The mean of any number of identical numbers is that number. &gt; And allocates the new meaned-row in a new matrix Again, what mean? I thought you had said that this matrix was full of &gt; each [row] corrisponding to a particle detected so, are you trying to average multiple rows? Doesn't that mean you're trying to average the positions and velocities of multiple particles?? *Is that really what you want to do?* I can't understand your problem. Please post a representative data set that illustrates your problem, including positions and velocities, and then what you would expect the output of the function to be. Just about anything is possible in Matlab, but you *need to have a plan before you start coding away.* As it stands, it's not clear (to me, at least) what you're trying to accomplish.
And, so I'm not a jerk, here's some sample code that will just dumb average rows together that have multiple time entries: % Assuming 3 cols for pos, 3 cols for vel, 1 col for time currentRow = 1; while true nUnique = numel(find(myVar(:,7) == myVar(currentRow,7))); endRow = currentRow + nUnique - 1; meanRow = mean(myVar(currentRow:endRow,:)); myVar(currentRow,:) = meanRow; myVar = [myVar(1:currentRow,:); myVar(endRow+1:end,:)]; currentRow = currentRow + 1; if currentRow&gt;=size(myVar,1) break; end end
Wow. Thanks, that's a lot of effort to remove some bold headers!
I suggest you read some of the matlab documentation for the plot function. This allows you to plot things and should be part of your user defined function. You can then pass the data you want to plot to your user defined function for plotting. As for the name, it is possible he means you should pass it the axis handle to plot in, or alternately, the name to put in the title of the plot. It's hard to be sure without seeing the question. If he says name specifically, i would guess it is the title of the plot, which can be set by the title command. 
Would something like animateline be helpful? Another option would be to run a loop which iterates the phase of the sine wave, then updates the plot. 
It is supposed to be the title of the plot, not sure how you would have guessed that. I don't fully understand that but I will definitely be reading the documentation for the plot function. I have used the built-in MATLAB plot function before so I am relatively comfortable with it, I know there is still a lot I don't know about it. Thank you for this reply. I honestly feel bad even asking for help because I really do want to do this myself and don't want anyone to do it for me. I am all about taking on challenges. I feel like even asking for help makes me seem lazy. I uploaded the directions for the assignment along with what I've done so far and the little code thing for the imgur url spelled out LaazI which made me feel like my computer was calling me lazy so I didn't include it. I think I'm just going to read up on the plot function for now. Again thank you for your reply and suggestion on what to read up on.
What does the website say? How would you use a toolbox without a Matlab license? 
Sorry if I did not explain myself well: I can buy the student license (with no toolboxes) for $50, and it lets me add on toolboxes for $10 each. However, it "crosses off" $30 for the toolboxes, since I am buying them with the license. I was wondering if I bought the $50 license now, could I buy the toolboxes for $10 in the future.
And the size of the table! But I agree.
 function [x] = requestedFunction(A, Q) M = zeros(length(Q),length('a':'z')); M(:,1:size(A,2)) = A; x = M\(-Q); x = x(1:length(Q)); end So here is the function you wanted. It takes as an input your known coefficients [a1, b1, c1 ... z1; a2, b2 ... z2] etc. And your Q. Then substitutes in a matrix of zeros. And then solves it for x. But.. this function is idiotic, you gain nothing by creating it. Effectively you are just padding a matrix with more zeros and then removing the zeroes at the end of your solution. I do not understand why you would even want it.
This is really a pain to follow, because you're not really providing all your code. For example, when you "calculate helium generation for each node as:" you have time and a time step, but it doesn't look like you're **incrementing** the time step. Are you showing us an inner loop and leaving off an outer loop? Did you forget to write an outer loop? You know what else, you also don't appear to *sum the results* of each time step. Also you are inconsistent with your units. Again, can't tell if it's a sloppy problem statement here or if you're actually inconsistent with your units. You say, "Currently I am calculating the concentration in atoms/g in each shell:" And then you go on to describe units that would give you a density in atoms per (volume). What are the units on your volume? Good question. Then you give a symbolic (?) equation that "corresponds to the age equation." What does that mean? How are you solving it? If you want help figuring out where your calculations are going wrong, please post the *equations you are trying to implement*, some sample inputs, sample outputs, and your *complete implementation.*
As others have said it really helps if you post the code, we don't know the particulars of your problem. That said, have a look at logical indexing. If the problem is what I think it is then it will be a great help to you. If you want someone to bother to look at the problem then definitely provide some code and a sample matrix.
Does your school not have an academic licence? Seriously consider looking into octave instead, it's an excellent alternative.
You've formatted your post quite nicely but have left out a lot of information. It really would be a lot easier to just post the entire thing on pastebin or something (with example data if needed) so I can run it myself. As it is now you've given some formulas and I have no idea what the input or output should be like. If the ages are too low my first guess would be a conversion error somewhere, I notice you're dividing by your vector volume twice, check that all the units are correct. Run the code one line at a time and check if the numbers are sane.
+1 for units. Units units units units units. You can't say it enough. Checking units is the fastest way to tell if you're making garbage. Correct units doesn't mean you're doing it right, but incorrect units 100% means you're doing it wrong. 
Use datetime() ;)
I think it's xticks(labels) to change the names of the ticks. 
If they are shapefiles then you can use 'shaperead'. Although I think you may need the Mapping Toolbox for that. If they are dbf files then you can generally open them in excel. So convert them to excel and use xlsread.
You can [read the doc for datenum](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/datenum.html). It shows you how to format the date numbers to be whatever format you want. 
For relatively modern versions of matlab you can convert to a datetime() array, that will directly show as dates when plotted.

Sorry I misunderstood the question. I would contact your school to see if they have an academic license, and then I would contact Mathworks and ask them directly. They're very responsive - you'd have an answer already if you had asked them instead of posting here - and I'd hate for you to wind up wasting money over some bad advice here. 
I'm relatively new to matlab and thought this may be an easier way to create and solve matrices rather than manually inputting all the 0s etc. I had 13 separate equations to solve and thought it may be easier to only input my known coefficients into the equation function and then use "equationstomatrix" and "linsolve." If you have any advice, it'd be much appreciated!
There are a number of json libraries of the file exchange. Additionally there is one built in to the newer versions of matlab. 
In my experience, the libraries will load up the json into a cell or struct, and it can be a pain in the neck to figure out the relationships between the json hierarchy and the Matlab data. A little trick I've used to help figure out the hierarchy is to open the json in Excel, the struct/cell in the Matlab Variable editor, and "dig in" to the struct/cell while making notes of where the data is on the Excel file in an adjacent column on a per-row basis. 
You’ll probably need a regular expression to find all the types of words you need igoring case and punctuation. 
Thanks for the help 
Did it work?
You are welcome.

If you were doing the math correctly, you wouldn't need a scaling factor to account for your step size. I can't figure out what any of your math is supposed to be because you only posted your broken functions. I say broken because, as much as you have "completely tested" them, you're still getting the wrong answers, aren't you? If I had to guess, I'd say your problem is where you calculate the diffMat values. You completely ignore any *values* in psi and choose to generate a value based solely on the number of elements in psi instead. If you want more help, you should post the original method, from a book or paper, so we can follow along and compare the intended method against your implementation. 
So should I do this 1000s of times?
No that would be silly. Use a function to get all filenames in a directory with all of your images. Then loop over your array containing all the filesnames to read those images and save them to a cell, or a struct array, whatever you want. Afterwards save that single cell or struct array into a .mat file.
You could paste your code also.
Ah, thanks. I hope this works. :)
Thanks for your reply. What I mean by testes is that they behave as designed, which means that the issue is somewhere in the second derivative function. diffMat is the same matrix regardless of the psi values, because the second derivative operation, as explained in the edit, is a constant matrix multiplication times the inverse of the spatial refinement squared.
Check you starting points for C1 and C2. This is a gradient optimizer, so it's result may be wildly dependent on where you start. 
So as far as I understand, your code is working but your results do not match the theory you researched? Keep in mind 99% of the people in the sub, including me, reading your post will have zero clue what is going on with your calculations. In other words, you are the expert here. The best advice I can give is to make extensive use of the debugger. Go make a breakpoint slightly before the part where you think the error is. Make note of all the variables computed and their values; double check that the calculated values to that point are 100% correct. If you are not 100% sure, then go back even more in the code. When you arrived at the point where you know that everything is correct, you double checked, calculated by hand, crossreferenced with your research. Then at that point you start going through your code line by line, computation by computation and you follow your variables, making sure that the values are what you expect them to be at every point. Do not skip any lines by thinking: "yeah I'm pretty sure I know what it does". If you go through your entire code by doing this you will find your error eventually. It might be a cumbersome and time consuming task, but it will make sure you will not miss any error.
Thanks for the advice, but I'm unsure where to start. I've included my two curves below: [Combining Constants](https://i.imgur.com/5ht5tvl.png) [Adding Known Value](https://i.imgur.com/Mnv6RlY.png)
The 10^10 is the problem for sure. Without hunting down why (the first comment above is probably on track), just do the arithmetic by hand. D=C2/4.7e10. 
The recessionplot function returns a vector of handles of all those gray patches. The most efficient way is probably to loop over all those handles, collect the XData. Then evaluate your data at the collected XData and take the mean of the evaluated data.
The 10^10 could be a problem. Have you tried centering and scaling the data? This may or may not help. The ideal starting point for any optimization process is at the optimum. I would set the C2' equals to the D*C2/constant and use the C2 and D values from the optimum at the previous parametric atom of your problem and see if the optimizer will be able to converge. You have to read up a bit on how the gradient optimization work (if you haven't done so already) and it will become a bit more clear. 
A combination of [lower](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/lower.html) and [fgetl](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fgetl.html) should do what you want. 
I disagree. I think OP _should_ do it thousands of times. Make sure you spell all the filenames correctly or it won't work.
Hey, your link doesn't seem to be working. 
hmmm, I sent it to some friends and it worked, the url is 189.168.97.164:8080/songsim/songsim.html because I'm hosting it in a raspberry, can you show me a screen shot of what you see?
I mean, it depends on what you mean by moderate-to-heavy. I would consider the work I do "moderate-to-heavy" and I have arrays which are millions of rows by dozens of columns, and I do lots of matrix math on them, and 8GB is plenty for what I do. But my friend uses MATLAB to invert matrices which are rank millions, and he needs a lot more RAM. 
+1 - *Put some numbers on what you're asking about.*
Mate I could give you crap repetitive advice like "you get what you pay for". But essentially it comes down to two thoughts . i). Are you running large enough simulations regularly that you neeed more then 8GB RAM. If so then your either running a business or a phd. Which means you definitely need a bigger computer. ii). Are you just writing sloppy code that takes forever to compile? If i). Don't mess around and just buy a bloody server. Or, rent server space and work remotely. When your an academic the university will have a very large computer for you to access. If you're a business owner just cough up the cash and write it off on tax. God knows you'll quickly make it back anyway using the equipment productively. If (more honestly) ii). Think about how your writing code. At the end of the day NASA sent the apollo missions around the moon with less computer power than a hand calculator. High level languages are no excuse for bad coding. Keep it clean and keep it efficient. If you really wanted to you could probably overwork any computer by just writing endless (and needlessly long) loops into the code. 
Corporate network blocks non-standard ports. If you're hosting it on an RPi hosting it on port 80 should be quite simple.
Depends entirely on the size of your matrices. I have a 32GB workstation and ai have run out of RAM often, but that is entirely due to the specialized nature of my data.
You can get the Xdata and Ydata from the current axes and set the new values. 
More often than not, RAM intensive computations can be avoided or re-written to run on a machine with little RAM. For example, when inverting a matrix to solve a system you should really be using [mldivide, also known as the 'backslash' operator](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mldivide.html) which uses Gaussian elimination without explicitly needing to compute the inverse. I was working with an 18 GB dataset that sure enough was too much for my 16 GB RAM but was able to hack some code together to work on different parts of the dataset in series, or where possible in parallel. If you are working with data that CANNOT be handled this way, then you can look into computing clusters or online cloud computing which is much cheaper than paying for more RAM on your own machine.
use horzcat
Also, tall arrays can help with this. 
&gt;If you are working with data that CANNOT be handled this way, then you can look into computing clusters What, like building your own? Or are you telling me that commercially available computing clusters are cheaper than paying a few hundred bucks for a higher-end model with more RAM?
1) Look to see if your institution has access to one. If the computations are that intensive, then they should have access, as it is worth the investment. Most clusters are shared by a pool of people that each feed a bit of money into it. 2) If you don't belong to an institution or your institution does not have a cluster, you can use online cloud computing which is very cheap, just a couple bucks can allow you to run a project wit significantly more computing power. 3) It's nice to have extra ram but these computing clusters don't have 16, 32, or 64 GB of RAM. They'll have 128 GB of RAM or more. It's a world of difference and will allow you to run whatever you want. Even if you have a 16 GB laptop (as I do) you'll still run into projects where you need more memory. A cluster solves this problem entirely.
That was hard to read. What is your plan with this? You have the user enter **x/y coordinates** in a box labeled **angle**, and then... you want to rotate it? Are you going to update the user-entered values in the boxes? How are you wanting to rotate the triangle? About a vertex, or about the centroid, or about the origin? Coding pro tip - you can use `norm` to find the magnitude of a vector. As in, where you have: AB = ((((A(1, 1))-(B(1, 1)))^2))+((((A(1, 2))-(B(1, 2)))^2)); AB = sqrt(AB); % Side numbers for C. You could just have: AB = norm(A-B); and so on. Also, I thought there was a problem with your math - point `C` is labeled as being 98.13 degrees, but the problem is with your display - try `axis equal` after plotting to get the aspect ratio to be 1:1. Regarding rotation - just apply the rotation matrix. You have a rotation matrix. Multiply your points by the rotation matrix. If you want to rotate about a particular point, then translate that point to origin, apply the rotation, then translate back. 
What do you need help with exactly? What code do you have so far? How might you go about solving this? If your question relates to an understanding of your equations or the methods you are trying to use, this may be the wrong sub. If you have specific questions about Matlab then we'd be happy to help.
Basically how would i go ahead with making an advection-diffusion code with MATLAB? I understand the maths behind it and all, but it's making/starting the code that's the issue for me haha. 
&gt; how would i go ahead with making an advection-diffusion code with MATLAB? This is way too general for anyone to help you. Matlab is basically an advanced calculator. Write down how you'd solve the system mathematically with pen on paper, then translate that into code.
I thought port 8080 was the standard, you can see in the url that I used that
I can actually do all those questions you asked. I have basic understanding of MatLab. But give me a second, let me try and write it down and upload a picture :) 
I'm sorry for the hard time. I know I could have used "norm" but our teacher said that we can't use that command and that we need to make it like that. The original plan is: 1.- The user inputs the coordinates of A (anga), B (angb) and C (angc). 2.- The user clicks the button to calculate the triangle and the same shows up on the plot. 3.- Then the user inputs the degrees in which he wants to rotate the triangle. 4.- The user clicks the button to rotate the triangle and same rotates. The boxes containing the coordinates doesn't need to be updated. The triangle needs to be rotated in the centroid. Thanks for responding! 
Here's the question and what I have. :) https://imgur.com/a/Q1Xj6
Original code please, nothing taken from any websites/downloads!
You have an explicit formula for computing the next timestep from the one before it. You already know the initial condition from the problem; so it's simple enough to compute the solution at t_0+1, right? You just need to repeat that computation as many times as you want the solution to go. 
Just do your homework yourself. If you actually want some help here you need to show what you have thought of already, what specific thing you have trouble with. As this stands it’s just plain rude
But how do i go about that? It's the coding that's giving me issue hahah 
You said you could do all those things I mentioned, so what part of computing the next time step is giving you problems? Declaring variables? Entering the forumla? For loops? Indexing? A=zeros(100,1); A(1) = 10; for i = 2:100 A(i) = A(i-1)*2 - 1; end Do you see what this code is doing?
Yes. I doubled mine from 4GB and ran genetic algorithms and vision programs without complaint.
Wow! This is a revelation to me. Thanks
Don't forget documentation. Matlab's documentation is better than most textbooks
People seem to go into matlab and try to make their own thing and never use the built in tools. I always see people always use things like a for loop when they can use sum (sum ()) or something like that
I have a computer with 128 GB. Sometimes it can take up to 15 minutes to run certain Simulink files with very small step sizes... I think these files would crash out my laptop...
When you say it gets stuck, does it give an error message, or just look like it's doing nothing for a long time? If there's an error message, that will really help. If it looks like it's doing nothing, then it's probably calculating something slower than you expected, or just isn't converging to the tolerance you've specified. The code you've posted doesn't update 'e', so your while loop will never exit. If 'e' is specified properly later, there's a few possibilities: - Your tolerance is too tight. If you have an exact solution, you could try testing with that, but this still only works if it works numerically (if the exact solution is 1/3, the computer will never get it right, but 1/2 should pose no difficulties). Try increasing the value of 'tol'. If that fixes it, make sure the results make sense. - Your algorithm doesn't converge. This can be hard to track down, but if you step through with the debugger and monitor the value of 'e' for each iteration, you may notice that it gets larger, rather than smaller. If this is the case, either there's an error in your code, or you need to change how you iterate. - Your code is just slow. If you test with a dummy matrix u that's small (say, 3 by 3), it may run a lot quicker - even if the results don't mean much. If this is the case, you should try to vectorize the code, and avoid recalculating things. (E.g. (p*dth)^2 only needs to be calculated once for the outer loop - if the inner loop is called a trillion times, then precalculating this will save significant time). The biggest speed boost will come from eliminating the inner loop: for q=2:(n-1) % Indexing for the full circle u(p,q)= ((u(p-1,q)+u(p+1,q))*(-((p*dth)^2))-(u(p,q-1)+u(p,q+1))-... % Finite differences (((((p*dth)^2))*(u(p+1,q)-u(p-1,q)))*(1/2*p)))*(1/(2*(1-((p*dth)^2)))); end becomes q=2:(n-1) u(p,q)= ((u(p-1,q)+u(p+1,q))*(-((p*dth)^2))-(u(p,q-1)+u(p,q+1))-... % Finite differences (((((p*dth)^2))*(u(p+1,q)-u(p-1,q)))*(1/2*p)))*(1/(2*(1-((p*dth)^2)))); As a final note, the following code seems like it probably doesn't do what you want: u(m-2,1) = -1 + u(m,1); u(m-2,1) =u(m,1);
Try to use R = makehgtform('zrotate',theta). Then multiply the coords of each point by R. You will get the new coords rotated.
There is nothing inherently wrong with the code you are showing us. Of course, I don't know what's happening inside `drawrobot` but when I replace the code you show with: figure(1) grid on title 'generic title 1' x = 1:360; y = sind(x); plot(x,y); figure(2) title 'Another Generic Title' y = cosd(x); plot(x,y); Which is essentially the same thing, it works fine. So that tells me it's something happening in the cod you're not showing us. 
Please think about your question. There is no "if loop", unless you mean an outer for loop not shown in your code snippet. Besides, consider using a while loop and update the loop condition instead of using the break keyword.
check to see if you are making figure(1) the active one within "drawrobot". If so, get rid of that line.
I think you're right. There must be something wrong with my draw robot function. 
 &amp;nbsp; *I think you're right There* &amp;nbsp; *must be something wrong with my* &amp;nbsp; *draw robot function* &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;*^-Ilikep0tatoes* 
As pointed out, there is no such thing as an if-loop. Do you mean an if-statement? Second: &gt; I need text to be displayed a single time when I run my code but it's displayed several times. How can I prevent this? You prevent this by putting a print statement inside a conditional that only gets evaluated as true once. 
You will need a loop to loop through the time steps (a for if you know how many steps or a while to loop until t = tmax). For each step of your loop calculate the boundary conditions, implement the scheme and update your solution and t value. If you are repeating the solution for different time steps you might want to wrap it all in another for loop to automate this.

Hi! First of all thank you so much for your help and reply. I'm honestly very sorry: In the code I do have an error criterion being calculated and updated with each iteration; it seems like I forgot to copy-paste it in cause it was late. I will try to use the sped up version of the iterative process now, hopefully that solves it or at least gives us more info to debug. The code just gets stuck at the start of the finite differences, so I mean, it doesn't get past even 1 iteration even if I give it 5 minutes to run, which is suspicious I think. No sign of an error message at all. &gt; As a final note, the following code seems like it probably doesn't do what you want: You're probably right to be honest. We weren't taught how to express neumann conditions so I just winged it. Is there any chance you know how? I could elaborate on what I'm trying to do if you know this maths stuff.
- That's not a loop. There's no such thing as an "if loop" - Those squiggly lines are not just decorative. The editor is warning you about something. Pay attention to it. - Any code inside a loop will be repeated until the loop ends. Think about what you could do to make something in a loop only run once. If you've done that and it's not working, think about why that might be the case. 
That's not what will use up your RAM though. This affects CPU time. RAM is needed when you compute on square matrices with large n that cannot be sparsified (and some other things but mostly that).
That's not all your code. Post all your code. 
Nothing went wrong, it's just that the value for (x,v) = (0.1 0.1) is incredibly high compared to the rest, but thats not unusual for exponential stuff. There's two things you can do. Either increase the lower limits te alleviate the problem (do you really need to start at 0.1?), and/or change the Z scale to logarithmic using this: set(gca,'Zscale','log')
try your hand at [logical indexing](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/matrix-indexing.html#bq7egb6-1) . It circumvents the need for both the loop and the if statement.
&gt;You're probably right to be honest. The reason the previous commenter mentioned these lines specifically is because the second line completely overwrites what the first line does which makes one of them pointless, which one is correct? They also mentioned that you need to be updating e elsewhere but I'd jump on this and say what you have here for the while look will never work if e is updated elsewhere, we can see the while loop ends at the end of this code block, with no change to e present here the outermost loop will never terminate. The biggest issue for me is the structuring of the 2nd and 3rd loops. It is possible I have just missed your purpose but your loops over a and b look very problematic. So first of all when you are just setting a range of values to a constant it should probably be done in a vectorised expression but beyond that are these loops really supposed to be nested with each other and then the loop over q? What is currently happening is a single value of a and b is taken and along the way 4 entries (boundary conditions?) in u are set via these, continually then sequential values in u are overwritten after being set by the FD alg before a single FD solution is saved (via your oldu statement). Then a loop over all q occurs. The fact that you are avoiding q=1, n and p =1,n and the fact that a and b are never referenced in your innermost loop makes me think you wanted to finish this loop before you ran your innermost loop. Have a really serious think about (on paper) what you need done before you start looping over q. If I am right, I don't know how big n is but if it was just 100 then this one problem is not only stopping your code from performing correctly but its making it 10,000 times slower than it should be.
I followed your advice regarding the lower limit(changed them to 0.001), and I got the following figure: https://imgur.com/a/PpZgy. Even though I get a better figure now, the function seems to only plot horizontal lines at y=0 for all the v-values after the first one. Any idea what might have caused this?

Yes, seems to be the same issue. Try to decrease the 500 (number of samples for linspace, twice) to something like 10, and inspect the resulting matrix (y1) in a different way then with a waterfall plot. 
Well this doesn’t really have anything to do with linspace itself does it? It’s more of an issue with DFT. If I’m understanding you correctly you are testing with a signal of a known frequency and the peak frequency you get from the fft is slightly off so when you try to reconstruct the original signal by inverting the fft you get too large of a difference to the original signal? You basically have discretization errors. As you said you know it should be 1.0 but there is no „point“ there. The easiest fix is to just collect data over a longer timespan. The more data you have the greater your resolution of the spectrum becomes. If that is not feasible in your application you could try to increase the apparent resolution by zero padding the signal. Since you are not actually adding any useful data it’s more of an interpolation though.
For now, yes. I am using a known signal. I initially just created a basic sin function that I would use to test the code and FFT out. However, I do have real-time data that I will be using after. Therefore, I do not think it would be feasible for me to collect more data, as I have a set sampling rate on my test equipment. On the other hand, I think zero padding the signal would help a lot. I will try that out. Thanks for the help by the way.
I edited in some additional information at the bottom of my post before I saw your answer. Not sure how much of that is relevant when reconstructing signals from the spectra as I’m usually interested in the spectra themselves. Just to make sure you understood me correctly: I’m not suggesting to increase the sample rate. Just to acquire your data over a longer time span. But of course that might not be possible with whatever you are measuring.
If you are having this issue when the step size decrease it sounds more like a CPU bottleneck than a RAM issue.
Thank you for the complete answer. I understand better now. I was able to recreate a sinusoidal wave precisely using the addition of zeros to the end of my array. However, I had to pick a certain number of zeros for it to work correctly. I am now going to be moving forward to see if I can recreate a signal using my measurements of my real life devices.
Would a logical vector work? I am new to Matlab myself but I recall reading about them a few days ago and I think they do something like that.
thank you!
thank you!
Yea I'm sorry. I had a look and the 2 are conflicting so I'll sort it out. As for the e, I have an e before the outermost while loop terminates, so it should be fine now, thank you for the heads up! I thought a and b had to be nested within the gauss sidel solver. I guess I could move them outside of the solver and have them just be regular for loops. Will see what happens. So just to elaborate, I was told to avoid 1 and n so that my domain is 1 bigger in each dimension so I can have a bunch of ghost cells I can reference. As for a and b, you are 100% correct. I definitely thought they should be in the loop but after reading your explanation it makes sense why they shouldnt be. I have a lot to learn. Thank you so much for your input! Really appreciate it. Would you mind to have a look at an updated code later on tonight? In case it doesn't run?

1. It's an if statement in a loop. 2. You're right the squiggles aren't just cute decorations they're letting me know x will change for every iteration of the loop. 3. You're literally just telling me to try to think through the issue I'm having. 
An if statement in a loop is an if statement in a loop. There's no such thing as an "if loop". Yes. That's exactly what it's trying to tell you. You should listen. Yes, I am trying to get you to think through your problem. You should think through your problem. 
Define your frequency axis as `n = (-N/2:N/2-1)*fs/N` and your FFT'ed signal as `out = fftshift(fft(in))` and it should be correct.

 x = magnitude.*cos(direction); y = magnitude.*sin(direction); z = location; plot3(x, y, z); If you want arrows, I think you have to go to the file exchange; annotation only works in 2d I think. 
So, I've decomposed the vectors into their X and Y components, but now it's figuring out how to put those in a 3D quiver plot in a manner that makes sense. 
As your code is written there are numerous syntax errors, so it won't even run in Matlab. You don't define the values for your for-loop (i.e., the loop is supposed to be defined to run *for* some set of numbers, such as "for i = 1:10"). You also use double quotes in 'print' which is a command used for literal printing of paper, not just printing to the command window (use fprintf or disp for that).

lmao the link your posted isn't even a public document
Possibly it could be due to the 'k' coeffcient being zero (then the heat equation isn't precisely defined). If the PDE Toolbox still doesn't work it should be possible to simulate it with the [Matlab FEA Toolbox](https://www.featool.com). The following code should roughly be what you need: fea.geom.objects = { gobj_circle([0 0],0.3,'R1') gobj_circle([0 0],0.35,'R2'), gobj_circle([0 0],1,'R3') }; fea.grid = gridgen( fea, 'hmax', 0.05 ); subplot(2,2,1) plotgeom(fea) subplot(2,2,2) plotgrid(fea) subplot(2,2,3) plotsubd(fea) subplot(2,2,4) plotbdr(fea) fea.sdim = {'x' 'y'}; fea = addphys( fea, @heattransfer ); % Parameters for the human body rho_body = 985; C_body = 3470; k_body = 0.5; Q_body = 120; h_body = 4.5; % Parameters for the insulation rho_insul = 1; C_insul = 1000; k_insul = 0+sqrt(eps); Q_insul = 0; h_insul = 26.3; % Parameters for the air rho_air = 1; C_air = 1000; k_air = 0+sqrt(eps); Q_air = 0; h_air = 50; fea.phys.ht.eqn.coef{1,end} = {rho_air rho_insul rho_body}; fea.phys.ht.eqn.coef{2,end} = {C_air C_insul C_body}; fea.phys.ht.eqn.coef{3,end} = {k_air k_insul k_body}; fea.phys.ht.eqn.coef{6,end} = {Q_air Q_insul Q_body}; T_amb = 293; fea.phys.ht.bdr.sel = [1 1 1 1]; fea.phys.ht.bdr.coef{1,end} = {T_amb T_amb T_amb T_amb}; fea = parsephys(fea); fea = parseprob(fea); fea.sol.u = solvestat(fea); figure postplot( fea, 'surfexpr', 'T' ) 
or a(0) remember OP, Matlab start indexing at 1, not 0.
abs(fft(signal)) and ang(fft(signal)) give the magnitude and phase of the signal for the form An*cos(n*t + phi). Does that help? Not totally sure what you're looking for
Careful indices start at 1 unlike C/C++ and other languages which start at 0. MATLAB is out to confuse you.. 
I've figured out most of the code. Only issue I'm having is adding the initial and boundary conditions. Zeeta is 1 from 0.25- 0.5 while from 0 - 0.25 and 0.5 - 1, Zeeta is 0 Also, it is 0 at the edges, so when x is 0 and 1. Any help? 
Are you looking for a signal processing subreddit?
Perhaps? I have raw data that is a periodic signal and I'm trying to find the Fourier coefficients based on that. I have the period and amplitude and was looking for a MATLAB approach to find the coefficients based on that.
How is Matlab "out to confuse you" in any way? a(1) refers to the first element of a, a(2) refers to the 2nd element of a, a(n) refers to the n-th elements of a. It's pretty intuitive to me.
Ah, good point. I'm trying to get the coefficients based on the period and amplitude of raw data. Thanks for the tip, I'll keep going and see how I go.
A silly joke mostly, but they break the programming norm by starting indexing at 1 instead of 0. It just makes it confusing sometimes when you work with C and MATLAB simultaneously which is often the case. For example SoC development. 
 D = y ; x(8==D)
When I do this it tells me that ans = 1×0 empty double row vector 
Aww, i didn't look at your data :(. You can use diff(y &lt; 8) to find subsequent y values dat are above and below 8. then you can do a linear interpolation of those two values and apply that to the corresponding values for x to find the x value. 
&gt; 8==D
You just need to interpolate twice: once for each time that y crosses over 8. Use [interp1](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/interp1.html).
the i5 has a slightly higher clock speed, and i'm guessing matlab is slightly more optimized for the intel chips which are ubiquitous and have been around much longer.
Would you know the code for that handy? I am very new to mat lab and I am just using this for a small part of a project 
You need to paralizase, the ryzen cpus have better performance in multi thread that the intel ones. I suggest you to inform the issue to AMD, might they have a better answer for that. 
I supposed so. But 16 vs 8 seconds, that's double the speed of a ryzen cpu. Not to mention it was an i5 from 2 generations ago, not even an i7 yet. I guess I'll stick with intel. 
i linked you to the documentation page which describes full how to use the function
Yes I heard that using the parallel computing toolbox and manually splitting the problems into small parts give ryzen the advantage. But I was just testing with some raw matrix multiplication and was surprised by how well the 6600k performs. 
I suppose so. But the gap between two CPUs really surprised me. Do you have some spare time and do the benchmark above for me ? It's really quick.
10 seconds on my 3.1 GHz i7 (macOS 2016b)
I believe I am doing something similar right now. After the FFT, I normalized my frequency and output. Then, I use the findpeaks function to determine exactly at what points those frequencies occurred.
10 seconds on my 3.1 GHz i7 (macOS 2016b)
Wow and that's a laptop CPU. I wonder if my cpu is performing bad because of windows/settings or because of the AVX2. I recall that ryzen AVX2 might be 2 times slower Intel's AVX2 due to the 128-bit x2 operations.
If you are reading this and have just a bit of spare time, could you run the benchmark above (especially if you have a ryzen cpu) ?. It would be beneficial to the community to know how different computer setup performs. Giving the computer specs would be nice as well.
There is no one "right way" to solve a problem like this. The right way will be based on the nature of your data. Are the measurements noisy representations of truth? Do you have an underlying truth model, and you just need to solve for the coefficients in the model? The answers to these questions, and more, will determine the method(s) you should use. Your data doesn't look noisy, so you could use `interp1` as someone mentioned below. The only problem you'll have is that your function is not "1 to 1" (that is, you have repeating y values) so if you attempt to simply invert your function by swapping x and y, you'll have problems. You can overcome this by breaking up your data set into two pieces- the climbing part and the falling part. Alternatively, you could fit your data with a function (so, a polynomial degree 3 or so), and then use `fzero` to find the solutions were it is equal to 8. 
The Ryzen has hyperthreading or whatever the AMD name for it is right? I don’t know how the windows task manager treats the logical cores when calculating a usage percentage. So if you are fully using 6 logical cores out of 12 would it display 50%? Matlab should only use as many threads as there are physical cores for the BLAS so maybe that’s where the 50% comes from. You can read out the number of threads used by Matlab via “maxNumCompThreads” ( might be depreciated in newer versions) so you could compare if your two versions use different settings. It’s probably something else though since I would expect the 50% version to be faster if that were the case. On my i7 4790 I get around 4.5 seconds for your example but that is quite a bit beefier of a CPU.
I got 7.1 seconds on MATLAB 2017a with an i7-4790k. CPU usage went from about 2% to about 55%. further specs: 16gb corsair vengeance ram, gigabyte Z97N-wifi mobo, 980ti, H80i GT water cooler
The optimization toolkit my directly offer some tools to do this, but I don't know what they are. However, I can tell you how I've done it recently. Let's say you want to fit your data with an exponential function of the form `k1*e^k2*x + k3`(I don't know what fit you want to use, I just made this one up as an example). Without the boundry conditions, you could solve this by using `fminsearch` by making initial guesses for `k1`, `k2` and `k3` and then letting `fminsearch` find the optimal solution. This would be the best fit for your data. However, with your boundary conditions, you can no longer let all three k's change- two of them are fixed once you've chosen one. So, you choose which 2 k's you want to solve for, as a function of the other k. Thus, what you want is to solve, for example, k2(k1) and k3(k1) (k2 as a function of k1 and k3 as a function of k1, which you can solve for using your boundary conditions). Now, you only let `fminsearch` vary a single parameter, `k1` and inside of your function `fminsearch` is working on, you solve for `k2` and `k3` given that `k1`. Thus, `fminsearch` will find the `k1` which minimizes your error subject to the constraint that it passes through your boundary conditions. 
FYI, the peaks should be the peaks whether normalized or not. The only reason you might want to do normalizing is if you were going to follow-up with thresholding or something similar. 
This sounds like you need a spline function. Just search spline on matlab
I don't think he wants a spline, as he doesn't want interpolation. It seems like he wants a "best fit" method, with boundary conditions. 
&gt; this is due two days from now I'm extremely stressed Yeah, life pro tip: don't put off projects. Your code doesn't even run. It certainly doesn't do what you need it to do. I would be stressed, too. &gt; the issue I'm having is setting this all up. Specifically... We need to set up vectors v = &lt;vx, vy, vz&gt; and a = &lt;ax, ay, az&gt; (the velocity and accel vectors) but I'll be honest I'm having trouble setting up a vector with three elements where v(1) represents the velocity in x and so on. No you're not. Your code has: v = [0 0 0];%Instantiating the velocity vector &gt; I can't seem to get it when I type in the command window 'v(1)' in an attempt to display the first element of the vector v I get an error saying "v is not defined", but (words) Well yeah, you have to *run* the script first to get it to do anything in the script. If your script has errors, it will not run. Your script has errors. It will not run. &gt; Any help just setting this up will actually get me on to the meat of the problem the RK2 algorithm. Get your script to run. Look on the right of the script editor, where the scroll bar is or would be. See all the red lines? They are errors. Mouse over the red lines and read the error. Fix the errors. &gt; Now since the forces depend on the velocity and and what? &gt; then I would imagine we would need to set up a position vector to iterate and solve for? Solve for what? &gt; But we only have two equations, (words) so we can set these up like F = ma = I mean, you can do physics and say `ma = sum(forces)`. You need to define `forces`. You seem to have the equations for two forces. You could even rearrange that to be `a = (1/m)*sum(forces)`. &gt; and then solve for the acceleration vector and then solve for the velocity and then solve for the position using RK2 iterations (all within the same loop)? No, solve for acceleration and then numerically integrate for speed and position. &gt; I understand somewhat well the method behind RK2 That's good... but it's not anywhere in your code. &gt; I'm just having a lot of trouble conceptualizing Slow down. Make a plan. Work out the steps to solve it as though you were going to do it by hand. Code the first step, and the first step only. Run that with sample inputs. Does it match your hand calculations? Do it again for step 2. Repeat until you're done. &gt; I'm unfamiliar with matlab Yeah, I know. Sorry. &gt; on top of very stressed out Well, again - see point #1. Don't put projects off. Do the homework. Read the material before it's covered in class. I can't imagine you're this far into a semester and have no experience with Matlab - there should have been *something* along the way up to now. 
Ah I was going more off of the title then the content with my answer. You are correct sir.
I am looking at this fminsearch function and apparently it only takes one initial guess. Also I want to approximate the data to a cubic polinomial, how can I use your function in this case?
Because `x0` in `fminsearch` can be an array (or even a matrix). So, using my example above, you can say `x0 = [k1,k2,k3]`
Takes my early 2015 13'' MacBook Pro 12.1 seconds with an i5 at 2.7 GHz.
True, that's what I did in my case. However, that may not be the same for OP.
Pretty much this. One small caveat: you can access pi by typing "pi" without quotes. You might want to use that instead of manually typing out pi and 2*pi as 3.14 and 6.28
This is a common task in fitting problems and the solution, as /u/weed_o_whirler essentially said, is to construct a fit function that satisfies your boundary conditions for all possible parameters. In other words you redefine the function that you're fitting to your data so that it can only describe solutions which are acceptable to you. 
Easiest way is to recast as 4 first order ODEs. Do this by making dxdt and dydt solution functions as well. This is especially easy for you because all of your BCs are at the same spot. 
So, I'd have the two previous equations, as well as: x1 = sqrt(sqrt(k^4 y1^4 + 16 k^2 m^2 x2^2)/(2 k^2) - y1^2/2) y1 = sqrt(sqrt(16 g^2 m^2 + 32 g m^2 y2 + k^2 x1^4 + 16 m^2 y2^2)/k - x1^2)/sqrt(2) Then I can use dsolve?
Nope. D x = v D y = u D v = your first eqn D u = your second eqn
Thanks for your help! But I'm still very lost...
&gt; I don’t know how the windows task manager treats the logical cores when calculating a usage percentage. So if you are fully using 6 logical cores out of 12 would it display 50%? &gt; Matlab should only use as many threads as there are physical cores for the BLAS so maybe that’s where the 50% comes from. &gt; + Thank you! So the your result is similar to that of my friend's 6600k. It seems matlab pushes all physical threads to 100% and ignore hyperthreads.
+ Yes this is exactly what happens, it seems matlab only push physical threads to maximum (more details in EDIT 1). I'll do some more test with SMT on/off and overclocking.
Look up the state space method in any systems modeling or control textbook. It's a way to reduce an nth order ODE into a system of n first order ODEs, and one method of doing so is the "canonical form" which u/freireib is describing.
So, I think I am heading in the direction you pointed to. I passed the two equations in my op into odeToVectorField giving me a 4x1. Then, I put the new system into ode45. Still working on using what the results from that were.
this youtube video gives a step by step guide to the approach he is describing. you would do this once for each of the equations you have, leaving you with four differential equations instead of two: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9G8b7FxEHc it's pretty easy once you've done a few examples.
Using state space is a really interesting strategy. I've got a decent grasp state space method; I am in a controls class currently. However, due to the nonlinear nature of the ODEs, I can't wrap my mind around it being possible to represent this system in state space notation.
Is the default data type always double ?
QUT?
Actually, I believe I have got it now. Thanks guys. I will post a solution after verifying for any lost souls who's searches bring them here.
default is double. you can have it return single by including 'single' in the function call: r = rand(1,4,'single')
`j` is just `1j` in Matlab. If you write `4+2j`, you would get the complex number `4+2j`.
5.1 seconds, 100% utilisation, i5-4690k
I understand I wasn't saying my code was finished I posted it to show where my errors are and I was hoping for some constructive criticism on the specific questions I asked not someone to project whatever is bothering them on to someone else that seems like they're in a bad place. Sure misery loves company, but it's not productive and you just look like an asshole.
I would suggest using the tf function https://nl.mathworks.com/help/control/ref/tf.html and then its just basically filling in. You can create the bode plot with the bode command. https://nl.mathworks.com/help/control/ref/bode.html Read the documentation carefully on how to use these functions. If you supply a second input argument into the bode command, you can choose minimum and maximum omegas.
That's really fast o.O Your result is faster than a 4790k with 8 threads at 50%. It seems that in matlab, 4 physical cores at 100% is better than 8 hyperthreads at 50%, since there's little overhead and resources sharing between thread in the first case.
Yeah, I'm kind of surprised by it too.
So Ryzen performs wayyy worse than intel cpu in raw matrix multiplication. Must be due to the AVX2
If it helps, my laptop with an i5-6200u @ 2.3GHz and Win7 in a virtual machine takes about 25 seconds.
I get a lot (a **lot**) of errors when I try to run your code, but the one you stated is not one of them. That said, your `fun_1` has the bit: I(round(ti)) but `fun_2` has: I(ti) If I had to guess, that's what I'd assume the problem is. Rounding `ti` allows the result to be used as an index. Not rounding it, if it's not an integer, implies that you're trying to use `I()` as a function.
[This](https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=optimizer+based+on+the+quasi-newton+algorythm+matlab) returns [this](https://www.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/unconstrained-nonlinear-optimization-algorithms.html).
Yes round(ti) solves the problem indeed, updated code (so that for testing fun_3 calls fun_1, for celerity purposes): J=1:1:100; C_0=1:1:100; Ks=1; s=1:1:100; c=2; Su=1:1:100; I=1:1:100; P_ti=0.1:0.1:10; %fun_1=@(t)integral(@(ti)I(round(ti)).*P_ti(round(t-ti)),1,t-1); fun_1=@(t)integral(@(ti)I(round(ti)).*P_ti(round(t-ti)),1,t-1); kl=500; Re=1000; k=2; fun_3=@(t)kl*integral(@(ti)fun_1(round(ti)).*min((Ks.*s(round(ti)).^c)./Su(round(ti),Re))... ./((Ks.*s(round(ti)).^c)./Su(round(ti))).*exp(-(k+kl).*(t-ti)),2,t-1,'ArrayValued',true); t=2:1:5; figure(1) y_1 = arrayfun(fun_1,t); plot(t,y_1); figure(2) y_2 = arrayfun(fun_2,t); plot(t,y_2); figure(3) y_3 = arrayfun(fun_3,t); plot(t,y_3); 
Huh, I have basically the same setup and get around 4.5 seconds with Matlab 2016a on Linux. I get the basically the same numbers in Julia, do it shouldn’t be a version issue.
Do you have the ryzen 1600, or the i7 4790k ?
The i7 It runs using 4 physical threads which should be the correct behavior in my opinion. I could probably shave of a bit more time by switching on my case fans as that allows for continuous turbo boost for me. It’s not really a fair comparison to the ryzen though. I was just surprised to see such a difference to the other guy with this cpu.
Dude, organize your code. Why do you think its so much trouble to find your problem? You literally have an anonymous function, which contains an anonymous function which contains an anonymous function. Trying to properly debug that is a nightmare. Now on to your code. The part of: Su(round(ti),Re) Will give an error after we succesfully debug the error of having non-proper indices. This is because Su is just a one-dimensional array. Now I'm also pretty damn sure the error is in the following part: P_ti(round(t-ti)) At some point there is a part where t and ti are both 2. thus t - ti evaluates to zero, thus giving you that error. Now I heavily suggest you rethink your approach of whatever your trying to do, because I'm pretty sure there is a better way. At the very least try to properly maintain your code, because this is just a mess.
2.6 seconds is not too much of a difference due to some random errors (sometimes matlab takes more time to run a code the first time). However, letting matlab use 4 physical threads at 100% gives better performance than 8 threads at 50%. The difference to the ryzen CPU, however, is huge.
You're cascading values and getting zero. It's hard to figure out because your code is really hard to follow. Bear with me while I try to explain. Starting at the *bottom* and working *up*: t=2:1:5; Okay - the first value of `t` is `t(1) = 2`. Where is `t` used? I'll abbreviate your function with `&lt;...&gt;`, so things are easier to read. You define: fun_3=@(t)kl*integral(@(ti)fun_1(round(ti)).*&lt;...&gt;, 2, t-1, 'ArrayValued', true); So, what's happening *here* is that you can pass in a variable `t`, and then you take an integral from 2 to `t-1`. This is done by defining a *new* variable, which you are calling `ti`, and basically saying that `ti = 2:(t-1)`. The *problem* there is that `t(1) = 2`. So now, when you go `2:(t-1)`, you are going `2:1`. This means that `ti` in `fun_3` will, at some point, be equal to 1. *This*, in turn, becomes a problem in your `fun_1` definition: fun_1=@(t)integral(@(ti)&lt;...&gt;,1,t-1); Now, in `fun_1`, you take the integral from `1:(t-1)`. But, `fun_1` is being called from `fun_3` as: `fun_1(ti)`. This means that the variable referred to as `ti` in `fun_3` **becomes `t`** in `fun_1`. This means that, where you wind up with `ti = 1` at some point, you now are winding up with a `t = 1` at some point for `fun_1`. *This is where your problem comes from!* Finally now, your `fun_1` goes `ti = 1:(t-1)`. This `ti` is its own variable that is distinct from the one that is local to `fun_3`. The definition here, `1:(t-1)`, is problematic when `t=1` because you are now saying `ti = 1:0`. You use `ti` to index your variables, and so you are calling, at some point, `I(round(0))`. **Here's the fix** A couple of ways to do this: 1. Probably the best way, is to stop using variables to index other matrices. If you're looking to parameterize the equations, look at [parameterizing functions](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/integral.html) in reference to the `integral` command. If you just want to scale the integrating value, just hard-code the scale factor instead of trying to index the matrix. **Matlab will take arbitrary step sizes while integrating**. No step size is guaranteed, so you're *very likely* to get unpredictable results doing it the way you want. 2. The "quick" (again, unpredictable/incorrect results) method of fixing the problem is to just increase the starting value of `t` from 2 to 1. `fun_3` calls `t-1` and `fun_1` calls `t-1` again, which is how you're getting zero as an index. **Final note** Your code still doesn't run. You'll get an out of bounds error because of the following call in `fun_3`: Su(round(ti),Re)) That line says you want to index `Su` to the element `round(ti), Re`. The value of `Re` is `1000`, but `Su` only has 100 elements. Further, `Su` is a *row vector*, so attempts to index it like a matrix will fail if `round(ti)` is ever not equal to 1. I can't tell how `Re` is supposed to be incorporated into `fun_3` so I'll just point out the problem and leave it to you to resolve. Hope this helps!
Yeah, perhaps it’s just a random fluke. That’s roughly 40% difference though and it’s not like there is a lot of matlab code the jit Compiler might get fancy with. It should basically throw those matrices directly into a standard math library and that’s it. But who knows what else was going on the whole pc as well.
In addition to everything /u/ChosenUsername12 said: You claim that you don't know where the error is coming from. That's not true. The error message tells you exactly where the error comes from, even what line it's on. You can even click the line number in the error message and it will put the cursor on that line in the editor. The fact that's its even possible for your code to try using a non-integer as an index means you haven't clearly thought about what you want this code to do. Stop right now, delete it all, and think about what you're actually trying to do. Then write code that does that thing. In reality, it never makes sense to use anything as an index besides variables that exist specifically to be used as an index. Non-integer values are probably something like a physical quantity or some piece of real data, which has no meaning as an index into an array. It's like saying that my zip code is 7.5 times the weight of a 1990 Honda civic without the spare tire in the trunk, measured in pounds. It might happen to give you the correct number if you round appropriately, but it's just coincidence. It's not reasonable to express zip codes in numbers with units of mass. If you're in this situation where you have to round a value to get an index, it means you're trying to use the index like the independent variable of a function. That's a horrible habit. Cut it out. Indices are not function arguments. 
Did you even try to look at the documentation? 
On my laptop (7500U) it completes in 11.6 s. I believe there are two explanations for this, first is that ryzen is relatively new and the microcode may need some updating. The second more plausible explanation is that Matlab uses Intel MKL library for matrix multiplication (and other things). Intel is notorious for designing their libraries and compilers in a way that cripples AMD processors. IMO blame Intel for being the greedy fucks they are and contact mathworks about your problem.
Yes i did. I already have a solution for my problem. The nlminb function is a very accurate optimizer. It is also based on the quasi-newton algorythm. My next step is is to use my model on real data since i only tried to modify my model on a simulation.
+1 for: &gt; it never makes sense to use anything as an index besides variables that exist specifically to be used as an index and &gt; It might happen to give you the correct number if you round appropriately, but it's just coincidence and &gt; you're trying to use the index like the independent variable of a function.

&gt; I have 5 years on software engineering experience. Okay, cool. Doing what. How is this related to Matlab?
Hey, sorry, I'm down to do some interesting MATLAB related work lol. (Sorry, I thought that was implied by posting in this sub) Thank you for asking! 
Maybe the values in the txt aren't separated by comma, maybe use dlmread instead of textscan. Without seeing the content of the txt it's hard to tell what went wrong
Yeah, the data not being comma separated is my best guess about why it's not working. 
Thank you. dlmread worked.
Thank you.
&gt; downloads not a csv &gt; complains csvread doesn't work.
it worked for countless other .txt files before. 
It's almost as if Matlab code runs in very specific ways, like every other programming language in the world, and different files need to be interpreted in different wats.
With result and counter both initialized to 1, you're adding 1 + 1 on the first iteration. 
Wow that was a stupid mistake. I fixed it, but it's still not right .
Initialize it to 3
But I need to increase the number that's being added to result 
Maybe I should just drop
Oh yeah you’re right, did you get it fixed?
No it's still not working. What did you want me to initialize to 3?
As far as I know you need a ";" at the end of each expression in Matlab.
The ";" just suppresses the output 
A simple check can be done to see what you need it to be check=1:2:2001; return=sum(check); count=length(check); My guess is that your while loop condition should be "return &lt;= 1000000" 
Counter 
You're a life saver. It was supposed to be greater than or equal to. Thanks!
Or move the +2 before you add it to result
I got it to work. Thanks for helping 
This subreddit is nice :)
&gt; This subreddit is nice ... if you try. You have to try. &gt; Why isn't `csvread` doing what I want? Next time, try `doc &lt;command&gt;`, as in `doc csvread`. The first line of the documentation for csvread? &gt; Read comma-separated value (CSV) file Is your file a comma-separated value (CSV) file? No. So, what can you do about this? *Also on the documentation page*, at the bottom, is a section called **See Also**. What's listed at the See Also section of the csvread documentation? 1. `csvwrite`. Well, that's not what you want. 2. `dlmread`. Huh, that says read. You can click it. Know what it says? &gt; Read ASCII-delimited file of numeric data into matrix That sounds like what you want! Actually, it sounds like it [solved your problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/77gyfa/dude_honestly_why_are_things_the_way_they_are/dolshvb/)! 
"Gaussian" distribution is also called a [normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution). If you want to add Gaussian noise, that means that you're trying to add normally distributed random numbers. There's a function for that - [randn](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/randn.html). `randn` and `rand` are two different functions - if you want *normally* distributed random numbers, be sure to use `randn`.
Missing less than or equal to
Note that `randn` generates samples from the **standard normal distribution** (that is a normal distribution with zero mean and unit standard deviation). If you want samples from a general normal distribution with a given mean vector and covariance matrix, then you need to transform the samples obtained from `randn` accordingly.
7500u with 2 cores 4 threads, and still faster than ryzen. I guess you're right. It's definitely something with intel compiler and optimizer.
You can do this using Lagrange multipliers (constrained optimization) Google this or similar: constrained least squares Lagrange multiplier. 
try just `load` or `dlmread`
Can you provide a drawing of what you're thinking this is going to look like?
I use the following snippet rather often when I am trying to invert a dependance. without interpolation: % assume `X` and `Y` are arrays and I want `x` at value `y` [mn,ix] = min(abs(Y-y)); assert(mn&lt;=tolerance); % OPTIONAL but good to have x = Y(ix);
&gt; invert matrices which are rank millions Is (s)he doing direct inversion? Or some iterative method? Just curious
First of all you'll need a 4 dimensional screen. 
So I know I have to provide the slice function with a 3d matrix, so I was hoping I could make something like [this](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/examples/graphics/win64/CreateVolumetricSlicePlotExample_02.png).

Are you not just looking for a Bode plot?
check out the freqs function... you can type 'doc freqs' at the commandline to pull up matlab's help.
He already has one. A screen can display a 3D image (statically its 2D, but if you can rotate something it becomes 3D). The 4th dimension could be color So you could even do a 2D graph - energy vs position. Add a 3rd dimension by adding a time slider. Add a 4th dimension by assigning each datapoint a color based on Counts. Or you could have a 3D graph energy vs position vs time, and the 4th dimension is datapoint color for Count
Did you generate this? If so, problem solved right? Or are you asking how to generate this?
I know how to display the data, I just don't know how to generate the 3D matrix required from my 3 arrays. 
You have outlined a good way to get a frequency response estimate. You can also use freqz to plot the frequency response directly from fir coefficients. You can get a good idea of the fir filter frequency using the technique you have outlined above, but you need to cognizant of the input signal's power spectrum as it may not totally paint out the frequency response of the FIR filter.
as /u/selfadjoint points out you can use the following matlab command to generate your additive noise.... noise = sqrt(sigma) * randn(M,N); % M = the population size, N = the phase size I made the assumption that the last sigma in your equation was a mistake, because that equation doesn't make sense to me otherwise. Perhaps it is not a mistake?

Holy moly thanks for the link friend! :)
What have you tried? Have you read the documentation on logical indexing? 
College is going to be tough if you don't learn to Google and read documentation. 
I've tried using ind and find as well as writing the variables in different. I've read the documentation on the matlab website, but I can't make any sense of it. 
you can probably use this: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23897-n-dimensional-histogram alternatively you can probably do something like this: energyBins = linspace(minEnergy, maxEnergy,ne); timeBins = linspace(minTime, maxTime,nt); posBins = linspace(minPos, maxPos,np); positionThreshold = posBins(2) - posBins(1); % loop over the positions for k = 1:np currentPosition = posBins(k); % Find the rows of data in the current position bin positionLogical = (positionData-currentPosition)&lt;positionThreshold; % trim the data energyTrimmed = energy(positionLogical); timeTrimmed = time(positionLogical); % Use histogram2 to get the "slice" threeDimHist(:,:,k) = histogram2(energyTrimmed, timeTrimmed, energyBins,timeBins); end this loop may not be the fastest approach, but it should be a good start...
&gt; noise = sqrt(sigma) * randn(M,N); % M = the population size, N = the phase size &gt; To incorporate an average (mu), simply add it: noise = sqrt(sigma) * randn(M,N) + mu; % M = the population size, N = the phase size Not always appropriate for signal processing, but very much so in probability modeling applications.
You can do startValue:incrementAmount:endValue, so try: 2:2:8
That's the first thing I tried and unfortunately it doesn't work
Agreed, in fact I freely admit I have never seen a 4-dimensional tensor(?) of covariances before. With the reason being, as you have cleverly pointed out, my statistical background has been in the context of 1-dimensional signal processing. Perhaps if I did a little more digging into image processing I would have seen this exact tensor before, because it seems that it would be THE tensor to start off with in that context.
You need to populate vec_5, and index it for changes: vec_5 = X; vec_5(2:8)=vec_5(2:8)+2;
Hi! Thanks for the help. Would you mind helping me with vec_5 as well? I'm getting vec_5 = X; X([end-1:end]) = []; to remove the last two elements, but obviously it's wrong.
You can use a logical vector like a list of indices, so vecA(logvecA) will give you a vector with only the elements of vecA, where log vecA is true (I.e 1, where 0 is the same as false)
Why are you removing the last two elements?
Sorry I meant vec_6 instead of vec_5. vec_6 wants me to remove the last two elements.
If you want to remove elements from vec_6: vec_6(index) = []; Not: vec_6 = X; X(index) = []; That deletes elements from the original vector.
It doesn't seem to work. I just want to delete the last 2 elements of vector X. I'm guessing index shouldn't be used here?
Your suspicions are right in that your error is in lines 40-42.... try this L(:,i) = oneThirdOctaveFilterBank{i}.filter(x);
&gt; but it never works Do you get an error? Does it not give you the answer you're expecting? 
Misunderstood the context. You want to remove elements from X, then copy X to vec_6. X(end-1:end) = []; vec_6 = X; I recommend reviewing [Matrices and Arrays](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matrices-and-arrays.html).
I'm not sure why you would use those functions. What part of the documentation on logical indexing didn't make sense to you? 
Sooo you probably don't want for m=1:1:m Since the variable m is used twice? Either way, it seems you want to use the row index as a power and... you are writing x as if it is a vector? Then you have V and some new variable y. I don't really understand. If you need to make vectors of a given size and a given spacing you can use linspace, but you can also just run something like: index = index_start:index_step:index_finish To build a vector, which could be used to build the matrix you explain. However, the final code segment suggests you just want to make column vectors and take them to a given power, which you're already written out correctly? M = zeros(1,m); for i = 1:m result = x.^(i-1); M(:,i) = sum( result ); V(:,i) = sum( result .* y ); end
I know I'm a bit all over the place because I have been trying so many different things that now its become something of a soup I changed the Matrix shown to explain better, I don't want a bunch of different vectors as an output, I need something m x m The reason I'm using sum is because x is a vector of data input that I need to transform into a scalar. I'm trying to write something to do polynomial regression, the system of equations I need to solve looks like this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_regression 
Have your tried just removing just one element?
That is sadly not correct. oneThirdOctaveFilterBank does not have a .filter method and my syntax actually able to run. The ".filter(x)" is not in the Matlab documentation either. Thanks your reply though
Try vec_x = vec_x(1:end-2)
Sorry about that. I have loaded Matlab 2016b on my box... And I noticed that the syntax changes significantly between these two versions for the octave filters. On mine it returns the dspfilter object which does have the filter method. Good luck.
I'll give it a go. Thank you. If it works I'll let you know what it looks like. 
This is obviously part of tutorial exercise, the question ask for: 'Using the output from the m-file....plot the frequency spectra of the filters' So usually I would have used the freqz function, but I am trying to do it with the returned variables. To give you a better idea they are; *Input Signal plus noise component *Noise Signal (Single frequency) *The Low Pass filtered version of the signal *Segmented SNR for the signal before filtering *Segmented SNR for the signal after filtering *The sampling frequency The same process needs to be expanded for random noise after that, but I figured that would be fairly simple. I'm not familiar with the, cognizant of the signal power, would you mind expanding that?
You need to write (end-2):end. In your code, matlab tries to so end-(1:end) instead. 
My laptop with i5 7300hq and 8gb 2400mhz ram finished the test in 5.8 seconds. That's an laptop i5, and still much 3-4 times faster than ryzen 1600 in pure matrix mulltiplication. The problems definitely lies in either intel MKL or the worse AVX2 of ryzen.
I was just looking at the slice documentation, and ran the demo myself. The 'threeDimHist' matrix that's generated in the loop would be analogous to the 'v' matrix, and the 'bins' in the first three lines of my example would be analogous to the '[x,y,z]=meshgrid()' line.
Vectorization is what you want. Hope this helps https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/vectorization.html
Not only college but even job in future
Can you explain how you do this by hand? If someone gave you a written list of numbers and asked you to make a new list contain the numbers from the original list that satisfy some conditions, how would you go about doing that? 
for example if i wanted to pick numbers smaller than 0.5 in this original vector i would use this a = rand(1,1000); b = a(a&lt;0.5) but i don't know how to do it with ifs and fors
Depending on what output constraints the assignment asks for: Set an empty vector, create a for loop that iterates from i = 1:1000, then have the loop input a random number between 0.5 and 0.7 for 'empty_vec(i)' using one of the built in MATLAB functions. Alternately, create an empty vector and another vector--1x1000--with numbers from 0.5-0.7 (spaced 0.0002 apart, I believe--then have the for loop select random values from the filled vector to use as inputs for 'empty_vec(i)'. I think those could work The 'help' function was my best friend learning ML. I only fired it up halfway through my first year and really wish I had sooner! 
Yes. That's a good example of how you would do this in Matlab the proper way. But how would you do this *by hand* - like with a pencil and paper. 
Hi salzar, I gave it a shot and it worked! Thank you! 
Thanks for the help! I did this and it kinda worked; for i = rand(1,1000); if i &lt; 0.7 &amp;&amp; i &gt; 0.5 new_vec = i end end But with this for loop new_vec isn't a vector, it's a variable, do you have any ideas on how to fix this? 
I would just look at the numbers from the original list and copy them to the new list according to the conditions.
Right! But be more precise. Step-by-step, *exactly* what would you do? 
I would look at the first number if it fulfilled the conditions i would transfer it to the second list if not i would ignore it and move on to second number so on and so forth
Perfect! You just wrote your for loop. Turn that sentence into code. Just make it do exactly what you just said. 
Define new vec as an empty vector before your loop, then append the screened random numbers to the end of new vec. You'll end up using the length function if that helps, without giving everything away :)
Check out the documentation on indexing. 
Thanks! I think I've got it.
Do you have to do this in matlab? The det is easier calculated by hand in this case. I would try to play around with indices to create such a matrix. Maybe try a for loop and set some indices in a zeros(100,100) to the wanted numbers.
Yep, she thinks it's cool to do really easy problems by hand in MATLAB where they're 500x more work. I was guessing that was the case, I was hoping there would be a solution that wasn't quite such a PITA
Diag is the way to go here. As a first guess I would probably make separate matrices for each diagonal line as the add them together. A1 = diag(3,0); A2 = diag(2,1); A3 = diag(-1,-1); A = A1 + A2 +A3; There is probably an even better way but this is a good first step.
I joe that figure objects have a property called “CloseRequestFcn” which is called whenever you try to close a figure sundown. You could set this to be a function which opens a dialogue box asking the user if they wish to close the window or keep it open. Now I realise this is for Figure windows but it may be possible to do this with the editor. You would need to get the handle to the editor window and then set the CloseRequestFcn (if the editor has such a function) to your custom function. Have a look at the link below to get an understanding of how to get the editor handle. http://undocumentedmatlab.com/blog/accessing-the-matlab-editor Next, you could add some lines of code to a startup.m script which sets the CloseRequestFcn every time you open up MatLab. Note, I’m on my phone right now so I’ not sure if any of this is possible but it is how I would go about doing it. Good luck! 
It looks like the method you have outlined in your post going to work in this case. The signal power I am referring to is that you are going to ratio fft of the output signal to the fft of the input signal to gather your frequency response of the filter. You need to be aware where your input signal doesn't have power or else you are going to divide by zero or a number very close to zero which would be bad. 
Unfortunately, there is no “CloseRequestFcn” for the editor window and I didn't find any other useful property either. Nevertheless, thank you for your help, I didn't know Matlab provides handles for its own components!
See circshift
Makes sense, thanks very much! 
You can't use '-' in variable names. The name of a variable starts with a letter and can only contains letter, number and underscore.
If counts is a vector, sum(counts) will be a scalar and length(counts) will equal 1. If counts(1) == 0, mySpikeMatrix will not be created.
Have you tried running it? 
how is this a “technical question “?
you define your "bisect" function in lines 21-28, but when you call it on line 20 you're not providing any of the inputs you asked the user to provide in lines 11, 12, and 13. So, instead of just having: bisect; Provide the inputs: bisect(input1, input2, input3, input4, input5) however the inputs match up to the variables created in "bracket" portion. 
Another option is to use the fullfile.m function to always build your file and directory paths with the correct file separator regardless of the OS being used. Very helpful with running a MATLAB script on a variety of OS’s without change. 
Use two loops, not one.
Basically what I'm trying to do is have the user input a function and limits, and incsearch with search within those limits for a sign change. They are presented in a matrix. Then, I want the user to be able to pick one of the presented intervals and use the bisect function to find a root(s) within that interval. The problem is, without the function notation, the incsearch works fine. Then the second round of inputs work fine until after ITER2. Then it loops back to the 'f' input prompt and just repeats until I cntrl-c.
You want to perform a unique function on each element of the array, M. arrayfun allows you to do exactly that (no loops required!) M = [...] x = [1 2] arrayfun(@(matrix) sum(x.^matrix), M) 
 for i=1:1:m M(1,i)= sum(x.^babyM(1,i)); end I'm able to generate each row manually by doing it like this, but how can I generalize that? If I try to use a counter, say t=0 t=t+1 M(t,i)= sum(x.^babyM(t,i)); It behaves the same way as M(i,i)= sum(x.^babyM(i,i)); It won't evaluate the entire set of i before moving to the next row. Is there anyway I can do that?

oh shoot, my bad. I misunderstood what was going on. You could try an embedded loop like: for i = 1:m for j = 1:m M(i,j) = sum(x.^M(i,j)); end end a vectorized approach that qtac has started would likely be faster if that's desired. 
Dang that's a pretty interesting way of getting it done. I ran it and it works flawlessly.

ok, but Matlab is telling you that there are 'not enough input arguments' and based off the CMD window, it's at line 20. You are calling a function that requires inputs, but not telling it what inputs to use. I rarely use recursive functions similar to your bisection; have you confirmed that algorithm is working as you want it? Why do you have it constantly asking the user for inputs? Also, in line 26 you're telling bisect to return 3 outputs, but in line 21 it's only returning 1. Are these supposed to be different functions or the same?
Do they even need to be functions? I now have [This](https://i.imgur.com/kZyaH76.jpg) and the incsearch part works fine. After my second round of inputs, however, it just asks for the function again over and over
What should it be?
If you are using any graphics objects then make sure they’re using absolute or relative units, like `pixels` or `normalized`, and not `characters`, which can differ by OS/machine.
If the toolbox is well done it shouldn't use specific file paths internally. Those would be only in the scripts that use specific data. Just try it out on your data!
As pointed out, if you define inputs for a function you have to input them. If you are going to define them elsewhere, don't define them as inputs. As you are currently set up, you have two options. Make bisect take an optional number of inputs, or re name one of your functions and have them take different numbers of inputs. 
What are your keys? It would be much easier for people to help you if you provided something that actually replicated your issue.
Yes absolutely, but I think you meant to say that to OP. 
Not sure why this got downvoted. This is correct. All toolboxes, and any well written Matlab code in general, should work on both windows and Mac. 
My bad. 
Did a quick [search](https://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/systems-of-linear-equations.html#f4-969653) and maybe it's the [Null space](https://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/null.html) you're looking for. "Any solution is a linear combination of basis vectors." So: null(A)
+ Thank you so much!
man, I suck....should be closer to this: for i = 1:m for j = 1:m M(i,j) = sum(x.^babyM(something in here)); end end 
It's asking for the second round of inputs repeatedly because line 26 calls the bisect function again, hopping up to line 21 (this is an example of a recursive function that calls itself repeatedly). In your more recent image, it looks like you have another bisect.m file...Are you trying to call that function? Where is the actual bisection method getting implemented? I'd suggesting debugging the file and progressing through it line-by-line to make sure your code is executing the files/functions you're intending it to do. 
No worries, learned something new as well. Happy Matlabbing ^_^
So check it out. I redid my bisect section as a for loop, it works. BUT. My answer display shows one root. Press enter, shows 2 roots. Again, 3 roots etc. Until all are shown, and loop ends. Here's the [Code](https://i.imgur.com/t1k7qTK.jpg)
The Raspberry Pi and Android toolboxes only work on Windows and not on Mac.
Thank you for your input! I redid everything and this is ecast I have now [Code ](https://i.imgur.com/poI1BBr.jpg) and this is the result it gives [Result](https://i.imgur.com/Fk5Urpw.jpg). So it works!! I'd like it to just display the final array with all of my roots, but I haven't figured that out yet
https://mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/function.html You should probably read that. Don't change anything in the file you downloaded, its a function. The function needs to be called from something, from another script or from your command line. For example when this script is in your directory try this: tts('I am a robot. I am sentient');
I'm not sure exactly what you're looking for, but you could try something like: hold on; plot(x,y1); waitforbuttonpress; plot(x,y2); waitforbuttonpress; %... etc.
The problem in your code is that the h you define is the handles for the plot, it is not a function call to replot the software. What you need is to define a callback function for the slider (which you already did) that replots the function in the same figure. The most trivial way of doing this I can think of would be to do something like: Function callback(es, Ed) B=Get(es, 'value) %new value of b %put your functions to calculate the new x, y graph here Figure(n) Plot(x, y) End It is important that you define figure(n), where n is some number, to be the same as previous, to replot the graph in the same figure. This method may be slower than other ways of doing things, but it is the simplest I could think of. Get(es, 'value') gets the value of the UI element that was the source of the callback 
I could use something similar for my dissertation defense. My first instinct is to maybe use a for loop with a built in pause, but my experience with matlab leads me to believe there's a better way of doing this... 
I did spend a while googling how to call functions in matlab before posting this but I probably did it incorrectly. matlab is crashing on my computer now but I'll try your suggestion at the College tomorrow. Thanks very much for the reply. 
You want a 2D array. You could define `r` such that each row of `r` is one time-step. So, in this case `r(2,:)` would be "row 2, all of the columns" so would be the second time step. [Here is the MATLAB article](https://www.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/matrix-indexing-in-matlab.html) on all of this. It's a very important topic in MATLAB, make sure you understand it well. 
Hello! I haven't used matlab in years. Can anyone offer advice on where to start for this problem?
Try the following. &gt;plot(x,y1) &gt;hold on &gt;delay(5) &gt;plot(x,y2) &gt;delay(5) &gt;plot(x,y3) You get the idea. Change the value inside delay for more or less time between lines being added. 
Please read [our rules for submitting homework](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/462uwe/submitting_homework_questions_read_this/). 
Type help ode45 into the command window. 
The warning is due to you replacing the input variables of the function. Either don't include them in the function definition, or remove the lines where you redefine them in the function.
Please make screenshots in future!
Unused variables is a warning. It's bad practice, but ok. The error is from trying to run the function, you need to call the function from the command window or from another script.
"But im technikul wid ifone"
Also the variables are unused. Input or not they aren't used for anything or output
Hmm, I wonder if the assignments says to use the nlinfit() function.. should you then use the nlinfit() function? https://mathworks.com/help/stats/nlinfit.html
I think that is because his code is not complete. Either that, or more help is needed than can be provided by me.
That's just a warning. It's not causing the error message in the console. Read the error message to figure out what is causing the error. 
I was thinking the same thing and my inexperience with Matlab tells me there is definitely a better way. Haha.
also, clean your screen!
For one, ([wiyf](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=log(sqrt(x)))) log(sqrt(r)) can be replaced by sqrt(r) / 2 . 
So everyone already told you what to do, but this seems like a bigger problem. Do you know what it means to have inputs to your functions? Inputs to your functions are for things which are calculated or defined outside of your function. Things which are calculated in your function are not inputs. 
The one optimization I could see doing is changing U = r.*log(sqrt(r)) to U = 0.5*r.*log(r) Which is using the law log(x^(y)) = ylog(x)
To slow! but points for style though
+Thanks for the suggestion. I just tried it and it was 3 seconds faster. Line 2 took 35 seconds now. Unfortunatelly the whole function still takes quite long. 
+Thank you, too. Yours took equaly long as u\Weed_o_Whirler
But while we're in this friendly competition, multiplying by 0.5 is faster than dividing by 2!
Oh I didn't know that. Do you have any Idea about the implicit expansion of newer Matlab versions vs bsxfun?
I didn't believe you but I guess i overestimated matlabs JIT.. I got almost a factor of two difference: A = rand(15000,5) ; for i = 5000:-1:1 t = tic ; A = A / 2; Td(i) = toc(t) ; t = tic ; A = A .* .5 ; Tt(i) = toc(t) ; end %remove outliers Td = sort(Td) ; Td = Td(50:4950) ; Tt = sort(Tt) ; Tt = Tt(50:4950) ; fprintf('div time %f\n',mean(Td)) fprintf('times time %f\n',mean(Tt)) figure(1); plot(Td,'g-'); hold on; plot(Tt,'b-');
Huh, my first instinct was to assume that is due to the general floating point issues like 0.1+0.2 != 0.3 but on a second thought that shouldn’t affect just straight up comparisons like this. What types are the variables and are they all of the same type? 
I did a quick test and surprising implicit expansion was almost 2x's as fast as `bsxfun` so you might find considerable speedup there. 
I'm assuming there are some non-finite (NaN or Inf) values here. But why do we have to guess? The obvious next step in troubleshooting this problem would be for you to display the values in question and see what they are. Don't solve a riddle when you can just look at the answers. 
It sounds like you're almost there. If I understand your question, you just need to do this: Vector = zeros(1,88200); Vector(SampleIndex) = Values; No loops necessary.
This is absolutely correct, and is preferred way to do this kind of thing in Matlab. If OP insists on using for loops it's pretty much the same idea: for i=1:length(SampleIndex) Vector(SampleIndex(i))=Values(i); end
Use [varargin](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/varargin.html?requestedDomain=www.mathworks.com) instead of discrete inputs.
Well, your function has the name "power_law". The function you're calling is is named "linear_regression".

Please don't do peoples homework for them. 
Can you use the parralell computing toolbox to simultaneously run your processing on another set of inputs simultaneously?
If you want to spend your evening posting shallow and pendantic comments on peoples posts, then you'll probably feel more at home on Stackexchange. 
If you’re getting an error saying that something is undefined, that means you’re calling a variable that hasn’t yet been created. It’s a pretty straightforward error, and it should tell you exactly which variable is undefined and which line the error occurs on. Aside from that, your code is a bit confusing. After the if-statement, you say "hopefully_a_matrix &lt;= z + 2?" Which doesn't exactly make sense because the &lt;= operator is just comparing the two values. In other words it's not actually making an assignment. 
StackExchange is exactly what I'd hope this community would try to be more like. Unfortunately Matlab attracts a lot of academics who think code is some magic language and therefore don't even try to attempt basic tasks on their own before coming to this subreddit for help. 
Really important to include what errors you're getting. 
You posted twice, but that's not a big deal. However, if you could format your code to make it readable, that would be great. If you start your code with 4 indents, it will look like this It's handy, because \* look like \* instead of *making text italics*. Also, single lines between code will actually make a new line. As is, your code is very hard to read. 
Yes I can, thanks for the idea. However this function is nested in quite a few other functions with a parfor loop a few layers above this function.
That is good to know. I will remember that when I transfer all of my code to 2017b in a few weeks.
There is a built in function for recording movies , probably use that in conjunction with hold on and pause(time)
getframe!
Lol is that a Family Guy reference? 
If you look at the line quoted in the error message, it has a plain `^` after `(Ax - d)`. Either you changed the code after getting that error message, or the message is referring to a different file (perhaps PosAnalysis.m instead of PosAnalysisLAB7.m).
Wow! when i transferred over from the school PC to mind i changed the file name! Thanks so much!
I'm nearly positive the file can be recovered, but you didn't give a sample of the output. If I had to guess, it's a series of numbers that correspond to ASCII codes. Try `char(yourNum)` to convert your ASCII code to a character. 
is the u(r&lt;=0) = 0 line getting called multiple times? If so, could you do that replacement just once after you go through your loop? For example, instead of something like this: for k = 1:1000 % do some math u(r&lt;=0) = 0; end do something like: for k = 1:1000 % do some math u_slice(:,k) = u; %this depends on the size of U end u_slice(uslice&lt;=0) = 0; % then process u_slice into the individual u matrices
Just as a tip: those yellow squiggly lines are giving you good advice. Whenever you see one, mouse over it to see what it's telling you. In this case, it's telling you that you have a problem with how your function is named. 
Please format your code, by using 4 spaces in front of each line (and 8 spaces for indents). Then your code will look like this: This is a primary line This is an indented line As is, your code is impossible to read. 
Also, it looks like r is finding a Euclidian distance. Did you test out norm2?
What do you need help on, specifically? Your code runs so I'm not sure what exactly you want. The code is also 100% uncommented.
I can't understand where any of your formulas are coming from, but my gut says they're wrong. For example, you just put position and speed together in a matrix, and then call that angular velocity. If that weren't bad enough, later you define angular velocity to be positionspeed PLUS all the previous positionspeeds that came before. You don't scale by time step anywhere in there. You then go on to do the same with angular momentum - you just keep summing angular momentums. Momentum isn't path dependent. It's *just* mv, or Iw for angular momentum. There is no summation or integral in the formula! These should be red flags. **Consider the following.** You say: &gt; Now I am tasked with finding ... how small a tau I need in order to find a less than 1% change in the angular momentum Yet your code says L = L + (mass*det(w0)); Do you see? If you want L to change by 1% or less, than either `mass` or `det(w0)` need to go to zero. Mass is constant. What is w0? w0 = w0 + [rmid; vmid]; Nothing here is ever going to zero. I don't know what your formulas should be, but I'm pretty sure they're not implemented correctly. 
What do you have so far? See [datetime](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/datetime.html), [datetick](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/datetick.html), [datestr](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/datestr.html), and associated functions. Depending on your implementation you will need to decide which functions make the most sense for you. But all the information you need is there.
You can't open an additional instance if the previous instance is running code. If you want to instances to run code at the same time you need to open them both before running the code.
I call it angular velocity in quotes because I understand it's not angular velocity but I felt like commenting that. It's in a matrix because the angular momentum involves the cross product of the position and velocity vector in 3D. However we are working in 2D thus it reduces to the determinant of the matrix I've constructed. I realize I could have just wrote the angular momentum as L = mass*r0*v0 but I chose to do the determinant way as it was more systematic. I explained this pretty clearly in the code. I'm not sure I understand the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs exactly. I'm updating L and w0 because the position and velocity are changing and if those values change then so must the L and w0. However I know that they are conserved quantities (angular momentum is at least) and thus shouldn't change from initial to final state. So you're saying I should just calculate w0 and L with the initial r0 and v0 and then just leave it as those should remain the values for the whole of the trajectory? The reason I've done it this way is we have been numerically integrating for the trajectory and I suppose I had allowed myself to fall into the same procedure for the angular momentum without really thinking about it exactly. If you could further expound I would appreciate that. My prof. seems to be claiming that changing the time step will improve the "error" in the initial and final values but I'm finding the only thing which does this is changing how long the trajectory runs for (i.e., decreasing nStep but leaving Tau alone). This seems trivial though as the equations in the for loop are essentially the initial values for these quantities plus some 'delta' value so it's obvious that shortening the number of sums will improve the error calculation. Do you think a professor would ask something as simple as this though; to just find how long to run the trajectory to keep the initial and final energies and angular momenta under a 1% difference. Thanks for hanging in there!
Look in the MATLAB documentation for interp(), I think that will provide a good starting point to solve your problem.
pretty sure you mean [interp1](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/interp1.html)
Well, firstly I would argue about your [angular velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_velocity). You're mentioning orbits, but again, I'm not clear on what your base equations are, so my arguments may not be valid, but the equation given on the [Wiki page for particles in three dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_velocity#Particle_in_three_dimensions) gives: dr_dt = cross(w, r); for the tangential velocity of a particle. That is, angular velocity is *not* the result of a cross product of position and linear speed. Instead, linear speed is the result of a cross product of angular speed and position. Second, branching from that - again, there's no integral in that equation. This was the brunt of my original comments - if you're going to numerically integrate, the form for numeric integration generally goes: accumulatingQuantity = priorQuantity + rateOfChange * elapsedMetric I'm most familiar with position and its derivatives, which would lead to an example like: speed = previousSpeed + acceleration * timeInterval Here, `acceleration` is allowed to be a **time-varying** quantity. You make a *discretization error* by *assuming* that acceleration is *constant* over the duration of `timeInterval`. By reducing the interval size, you "chop" `acceleration` into more granular pieces and better approximate whatever the original curve was. This reduces error. You appear to numerically integrate, but you fail to include any `elapsedMetric`. You have: L = L + mass*dot(w0); There is `qty = prevQty + acceleration`. Not `acceleration * timeInterval`, just `acceleration`. Ultimately, my point is that it looks like you should: 1. Integrate correctly, to be something like `L = L + (mass*det(w0)) * tau, **OR** 2. Leave out the integral *and the previous values*, for something like `L = mass*det(w0)`. One or the other. It looks like you're doing a hybrid, and I can't tell why, but it looks like you're stuck between two relatively common forms. My gut says you should be doing the latter. I would have expected you to calculate acceleration, *numerically integrate that into velocity*, then *numerically integrate* that *into position*, then use those new velocities and positions in a new (clean) expression of angular momentum, etc. I would imagine the accuracy gains come in better evaluations of the position of the object. But again, like I said before, I would *strongly urge* you to look back over the fundamental equations you're trying to use and just double check that you're using them how you think you're using them.
I tried but couldn't get any improvement. Since you have large arrays have you considered trying gpuArray? bsxfun supports it.
i always explicitly silence expected warnings per-line to make sure I notice new ones.
I will try that, thanks. Although I don't know about the overhead. I think it will not be faster
No unfortunately there are no more for loops left in the function. Every line is only called once
Sorry about that. When I pasted it in on the browser it looked fine until I posted it. Will format properly in the future. 
Figured that was the route I needed to take. Finally found a good example of how to actually use it. Thanks for the help. 
When the value is ==0, I think the variable AG_Filepath is never defined
Is the data just the gradient of the height?
I’ve done exactly this kind of work for tracking rising bubbles[0]. My code generates this kind of image as well as sub-pixel tracking of the bubble interface. I even managed to pull some rudimentary shadowgraph imagery from the images. To get the effect in Matlab load all your images into a 3D (or 4D array if it’s coloir) and then use max() img_out = max(img_stack, [], ndims(img_stack)) [0]https://twin.sci-hub.cc/c6b4a44e30335e2a8a9a85bbd310f82c/10.1016@j.ijheatmasstransfer.2017.01.017.pdf
&gt; max wow that's really helpful! Thank you very much!! I was particularly interested in the tracking capabilities of a code in matlab, is it too hard to track a bubble's trajectory with matlab? (I'll start googling it right now) Thanks!
Yes, just a matrix (or array of matrices in the case of a video) of pixel brightness values.
It’s relatively easy once you have good images to start with. This sound like a learning exercise so I won’t share my code, however it’s explained in our papers on the topic. 
So if the values in the array are the gradient of the height (dH/dx) that means you need to compute the antiderivative. 
That's 4 equations and 4 unknowns. Would you know how to solve it on paper?
it says 5 equations and 4 unknowns though. And i do know how on paper but how would that work in matlab? Is there any function for it or do i just have to write it out? 
Yes that is what I was thinking of aswell, however I'm not sure how to integrate values inside of a matrix. There's probably some existing algorithm to convert a gradient-map to a height-map I just cant find the name of it.
Overdetermined systems are fine, as long as they are consistent. Have you taken linear algebra? Do you know how to, in matrix notation, solve for a system of equations? Matlab stands for Matrix Laboratory, it's very good at solving matrix equations. 
Try using de \ command
cal 1 is the highest (the class this is for). I feel like I've done this with matrices before but quite a while ago.
I think the 4 unknowns is a typo. The 5 unknowns are a, b, c, d, and e. Even if it was 4 unknowns, you'd still have 4 equations, just one extra one that you could throw away.
inv is the function for matrix inversion.
if you just want to plot the the pixel value as a height, use the surf() function
You have 5 equations, (each point substituted in the function is an equation) and 5 unknowns (a,b,c,d,e). Rewrite these equations in matrix vector form: A*v = r Where v is a column vector containing your unknown coefficients. A your matrix of what your coefficients get multiplied by. r a column vector of the rest. This system then can be solved in whatever way you like.
So for A, i pretty much plug in the x values into each equation and that gives me the numbers I put into A. Also, each row represents a function. What would i put for e then? the column vector would just be the values "a b c d e" going down vertically? Does the order matter for them?
The order does matter, as long as the order in the matrix and vector match. I'll give the first row of the matrix as an example. [39.0625, -15.625, 6.25, 1] * [a;b;c;d;e] = -62
Thanks! So that's what I did but I put the entire matrix times the letters. Is that right or do I have to do what you did and multiply each row one individually by column? Also, I'm not sure if you actually ran it in matlab but what do you put for a b c d e at the beginning of the script? It tells me undefined, and giving it a predefined value would clearly be wrong. Also, our TA said we shouldn't need syms for most of the programs yet, if you did use it (it's still allowed though).
I have put any matlab code in any of my comments. That was just the quickest way to write down a matrix and vector. If you understand what I did for the first row of the matrix, then repeat the same for the rest of the rows. And then solve the equation of A*v = r for v
ok. And one more thing, i would set the matrices equation equal to -62 on the right, right?
For the first row, yes.

well mate you sure seem like a genius figuring this one out, you could make a career out of it
For a system of equations: A*x = b You can solve for x by the following: x = inv(A)*b. In Matlab this is done via: x = A/b; or x = inv(A)*b; Can you figure out how create the matrix A and the vector b? Or that is too advanced for you?
It's clear from the question that you have five equations and five unknowns. The "four unknowns" is a typo.
This is a linear system.

Could you be referring to the MATLAB installation manager? Have you logged in and chosen which packages you want to install already?
I figured it out, the actual launcher somehow was buried in an incorrect file, and so I had to dig through it methodically to find. Pain in the butt, but issue solved.

Not a bug. There are two diff functions. * For numeric inputs, [diff](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/diff.html?s_tid=doc_ta) computes the difference between each element, so the result is 1 element smaller. * For symbolic inputs, [diff](https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/diff.html?s_tid=doc_ta) differentiates the symbolic function. It looks like you're using the numeric function and expecting it to do the same thing as the symbolic one. 
works fine for me, I don't think 'bug' is the word you were looking for. you are entering the function arguments incorrectly. fun = @(x) x.^2; x = linspace(0,10,100); d_fun = diff(fun(x),1,2)/(x(2)-x(1)); plot(x,fun(x)); hold on plot(x(1:end-1),d_fun); legend('y=x^2', 'dy/dx=2x', 'Location', 'Northwest');
So that means if I just to diff (f(x),1) then it should work? The issue is I need the actual differentiated function rather than the values of the differential at defined points.
You can’t differentiate a function handle like that, it needs to be symbolic. Try calling “syms x” first to make x symbolic.
Ill try that thank you
It looks like bicg doesn't have an input option to suppress the messages. So I can think of two options: 1) Open the bicg script and comment out where it produces the messages. It is inadvisable to edit built-in functions, so I'd recommend copy-and-pasting the code into a new function, something you might call "my_bicg.m." You'll probably need to make some subtle changes within the function itself to make it work with the new filename. You can open a built-in function with: open bicg to see the code behind it. 2) [Use evalc](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/234689-how-to-suppress-the-command-window-output-of-a-function-that-contains-non-terminated-statements-no). evalc evaluates whatever text it is given and captures the output to the command window. That link describes someone doing what you want. This is actually one of the safest uses for the eval family of functions. It would look something like: [suppressedCommandWindowOutput, bicgOutput] = evalc('bicgOutput = bicg(...)');
Thanks! you just save me a whole lot of CPU time
a is a struct array, so it spits out every element one by one when you do this, also when you do it yourself. see this: g(1).a = 1 ; g(2).a = 2 ; g.a a dot operator on a struct array returns a stream, which is exactly the same as if the elements are seperated by commas. this means you can collect them in a cell array like this: {a.name} 
Right, ok think I get you. Just threw me as I wouldn't have seen that as being distinct from say: g.a = 1:10; g.b = 11:20; g.b Which, when you call g.b does return as I expected... But I see the difference in how they're constructed now. Ta very much.

`xdata` is a 2x10 matrix, so the output of `V` is a 1x2 array. If you make `xdada` a 10x2 matrix, then your sample works just fine. 
I'm trying to change the color of the 3 curves that are fitted to the points in my 3D plot.

[See my answer here](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/75lo2x/graph_surfaces_with_different_colormaps/) on using multiple colormaps. It's not easy to do out of the gate. You can either map each surface to a different part of a custom colormap or plot each surface on its own axis, then superimpose them onto one.

You could invoke a second instance of Matlab by calling the binary. The binary is located inside the Matlab application folder (which are just special folders with a ".app" extension that the OS hides from you). If you installed in the /Applications folder you should be able to find it here: /Applications/Matlab.app/bin/matlab You could call it from a wrapper shell script or something. I've done this before in the past as a poor man's distributed computing solution, though not on Mac OS, but I can't imagine it's materially different. I'd recommend looking at the [matlab for Mac page](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/matlabmac.html) I've said it before and I'll say it again, what makes Matlab better than most other technical computing environments is its top-notch documentation. If you make a habit of scouring it to answer your questions you'd be surprised at what you can learn there.
Before you even work on the Matlab aspect of this, you have to think about the basic mathematical issue. If f(x) is a gaussian distribution with mean u, you will only have f(a) = f(b) when (u - a) == (b - u) due to the symmetry of the distribution about its mean. So if a = 0 and b = 360, the values will only match up if u = 180. There is nothing that requires a normal distribution to be well behaved modulo 360. You need to understand the implications of this in the context of your particular problem. Maybe a normal distribution is a bad choice for your problem. Maybe it's a good approximation, but only in the region of the mean value. I don't know the details of your problem, but you will have to before making any progress. 
Hey, sorry for the delay. I had to go back to the lab to get a copy of the file. [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-XPdQH-kZBvZHRGLXI3Wk9PSEE/view?usp=sharing) is a link to the whole thing. It's supposed to be tab delimited plain text, but it's very obviously... something else.
This is very ambiguous and it seems you don’t have any questions about MATLAB, just an issue with your model. 
Pretty unclear what you're trying to do, but it sort of sounds like errorbar() is what you want.

Yep, the circular version of a normal distribution is called the von Mises distribution.
Oh I actually didn't know that but it's easily the kind of thing I'd have had to learn at some point. You just saved me bunch of Google time :) 
Are you perhaps trying to read CAN data? Take a look at Vehicle Network Toolbox: https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/can-network.html
Woah that opened up a whole lot of useful information about directional statistics and wrapped distributions in general. Very cool. 
Surfaces are patch objects. You can set the CData property with a similarly sized image array ([M, N ,3]) to override the colormap. 
this isn't really an anomaly from a Matlab perspective; in fact, it meets the only expected outcome, that the number of datapoints that pass for the higher threshold is less than or equal to the number of datapoints that pass for a lower threshold. It comes down to the distribution of the correlation coefficients in your data, which you can look at using a histogram: bins = 0:.1:1; hist(sigCorrMat, bins) or alternatively, look at how many of the data points would pass for different threshold values: sigCorData = sigCorrMat(:); thresholdValues = -1:.1:1; numThresholds = length(thresholdValues); for k = 1:numThresholds currentThreshold = thresholdValues(k); numDataPointsPass(k) = sum(sigCorData&gt;currentThreshold); end plot(thresholdValues, numDataPointsPass)
So I won't help too much, but I can recommend the videos by my professor. Look up Eric Davishahl on YouTube, my entire course was on those videos. Very informative, and he does a good job explaining the math
Thanks for the information. I appreciate it. I'm just really stuck on this one particular problem. 
I totally get that, I was there too. Hopefully those videos show you something useful, it's pretty well broken down mathematically. The code just comes on it's own

Ive started by creating a cell array containing the vowels like this and an input ustr = input('Please enter a string to check for vowels: '); vo = {'a','e','i','o','u'}; vcheck = 0 then a for loop like for i = 1:length(ustr) if ustr(i) == any(vo) vcheck = vcheck + 1 then I was gonna see if it added up to 5 and then give a logical 1 but that would recount multiple vowels of the same letter. Am I going about this the right way? 
updated.
So, the error you're getting is: Subscript indices must either be real positive integers or logicals The error messages in MATLAB are very descriptive. A.) Reading them will help you debug and B.) Sharing them will help us help you. Notice the part of the error which says "must be positive". -1 is a negative number. It's not allowed. 
It doesn’t make sense to call y(-1). You can’t ask for the “negative oneth” element of a vector. 
Thank you all! I've tried the Von mises distribution with CircStats in Matlab and it worked well. Ultimately though I would like to standardize the output so that the mean direction is set to 0 for each dataset I plot (each dataset has a slightly different mean direction, but I want to compare them directly), but I'm not sure what manipulations I can do to the data to get this.
Variable 'y' is a matrix not a function. You cant ask matlab to give you -1st element of a matrix. Indexes start from 1 in Matlab. The way you defined your initial conditions is wrong. I hope this helps. 
I used 'hex2dec()' a lot for a similar situation. You can use 'dec2bin(hex2dec())' I believe. I used this in Simulink, It is supported through code generation blocks.

 [B,I] = sort(___)
Can you post what you have? 
Use [tic and toc](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/tic.html) to time which method is faster for you system
This is the correct option. As a general MATLAB tip: if there is a function that does something close to what you want, but you need some intermediate variable from that calculation- read the documentation on that function. MATLAB functions return a whole bunch of optional outputs. 
I'm pretty sure the \ operator is the fastest. https://mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mldivide.html
Thank you! I didn't know you could do that. 
Awesome! Thanks, I didn't know that was a command. I'll compare it to the other two. 
If you need a local min you can easily use fmincon. It requires purchasing the optimization toolbox, though. I don't know of any comparisons, but I have used Matlabs and it's pretty good. Global optimization requires an additional toolbox, but it's also quite easy to add in from a coding perspective if you want it. 
What is your x, and what is your cost function?
Hi mate. Looks like you've come over from Python or similar, where y(-1) would give you the last element of y. In MATLAB, use (end) instead. So, simply change line 17 to y(end) = ...; and you should be good to go. In future, a minimum working example and a description of the error message would be a help. In any case, MATLAB has a massive community, so someone's probably had the problem before. HTH 
Yes, I am! Thanks, I will look into this.
It's because you've misread what the sum *actually is*. The sum that you put into symbolab **isn't** the full, from n=1 to n=3, sum of the series. That is how you represent each *term* in the series. 0.2667 is the final term in that sequence (i.e. the result for n=3.) You need to add in the terms for n=1, and n=2 to reach the full answer.
In addition to what the other poster said, I think you also have some fundamental misunderstanding with the way matlab works. The sum() in your matlab code does not do what I assume you think it does. Have a look at the documentation for sum. Take a close look what you are actually passing to the sum function.
What you've put into matlab is the representation of each term in the sum, and not the full sum. 0.2667 is the result for n=3. Since you defined n=3 in the beginning of the script, there's only one term for MATLAB to consider, so the sum is just the case for n=3.
No offense or anything, but this is kind of a solved problem. Just about any fMRI/MRI package has tools for alignment. Talairach space and MNI space both will linearly or non-linearly deform the brain so that the AC-PC midpoint is in a consistent location. As for your code, it looks right. After all, you handle the z-dimension the same way as the x-dimension, and according to you, the x-dimension looks right. One possibility is that with all of your subjects, the "tilt" component of rotation (think nodding "yes") is more variable than "yaw" (shaking "no") or "roll". This could make the z-alignment look worse.
Can't you subtract the mean from the data? 
how do i do it so that it considers all them? do I have to use the symsum function. I previously tried making all my n's (1:n) but it says "error using *, inner matrix dimensions must agree)
No offense taken, you're right! That being said, all the co-registration tools I've encountered perform a variety of affine transforms which negatively impact my (super tiny) ROI and any subsequent analysis- hence the need to write my own. To your angle hypothesis: The error is visible even using a sample of &lt;10, and it looks like true misalignment. Since I manually identify the central point, angles shouldn't affect the ability to align in z. I've double checked the central points as well. I have *no* idea what's causing the error, kinda getting frustrated at this point. Regardless, thank you for taking the time to reply! 
Ok, I think I know what could be one of the problems-- the coordinate system. As a super quick fix, try translating by -1*tmat. Your X and Y midpoints could be coincidentally close to about half of the field of view, whereas your z midpoint could be far away. In that case, a sign error would not be noticeable in x and y, but very noticeable in z. If the midpoint is high, you want to lower it, and if it is low, you want to raise it. This is why you need to translate in the opposite direction of where the midpoint is located.
MATLAB uses indices starting from 1, not 0. Your for loops should start from 1. You should use disp for displaying rather than sprintf. sprintf will return a string and will only output it to the screen without the semicolon at the end of the line.
Thanks so much! I figured it was something simple like that that I just couldn't find. Also good tip on the sprintf! The reason I'm using it here is because a different part of the instructions said to use that function without telling us about the semicolon thing
Yeah, good thought. I tried that before, but the same error resulted. I didn't get any further with checking for coordinate system errors, as I was unsure how to proceed. Can you think of any others? 
No problem. I figured you were using sprintf as they had in the instructions. I don't agree with using it as a method to display to the screen - but to each their own!
Check "help system" [status,cmdout] = system(...)
The sum function wouldn't work in this case, but you'd also need a '.' before your *. Symsum function would be a way to go. Otherwise, a for loop that simply adds each term would also be a very easy way of doing it, if computationally more expensive. Try help symsum In your MATLAB console. 
Hehe, looks like someone wants to aligne tuning curves :) You can use your fit results to get interpolated values at the corrected locations (or simply substract the fitted preferred direction from your directions)

No worries, I am a beginner myself, only started this year to learn it, and since it is so powerful, I want to learn as much as I can, also help others. If you have more questions, feel free to send me PM, I am interested in what people are doing in other countries :D
That's awesome dude! What country are you from? Are you an engineering student?
Not really, without seeing the problem (in an image), having a sample image or two, and looking at all of the code. I sort of guessed that solution because it was one of the only things that seemed like a reasonable fix within the snippet of code that you posted.
Mods, can we reference this post in the sidebar? It's a great example of how to ask a simple question in an effective way, as opposed to just saying "do my homework, lol". He even showed us his code and the error message! 
I'll PM you.
Sure, thx.
Okay, so it's basically the problem I thought, but in reverse. Unfortunately, it looks like you're not going to be able to recover everything. Probably the biggest loss is decimal precision on any of your numbers. When you do `double(char(1.2))`, you get `1`. It also looks there might be a problem with the patient number. More on that later. Before I say anything else, **to prevent this from happening in the future**, add the following just before `dlmwrite()`: if ischar(this_data_line) error('Error - Attempting to write a character array with dlmwrite!'); end Here's what happened: When you put a character array in a matrix, Matlab converts the entire matrix to a character array. It does this by essentially running `char()` on each element of the array. For example, try: [1, 2, 3, 4, 'hello'] and you get: ans = 'hello' Those "boxes" still have your data, it's just that Matlab doesn't have a character set to display them. If you try: double(ans) You get: ans = 1 2 3 4 104 101 108 108 111 Now, hopefully you can see that your data exists in one set or the other - it is either all in characters, or you can call `double()` and get it all in numbers. Here's the next problem: When you created your matrix to write with `dlmwrite`, you inadvertently cast the entire thing to a character array. This isn't *such* a big deal, if you had one text string, but you have *two* and they're *adjacent*. So, where you might have had something like: [1,2,3,4,'56','78'] Now you have: ans = '5678' Then you used `dlmwrite`, and it wrote each entry in your new character array as an individual entry into your file. That is, if you check the file, you would see `5 6 7 8`, and now there's no way of knowing if it was supposed to be `5` followed by `678` or `567` followed by `8`, etc. The only thing that's a little confusing for me is that it looks like your patient numbers are all `ÿ`, which coincidentally happens to be the limit for one byte - 255. If you enter `char(255)`, you get `ÿ`. So, I can't tell if this means your patient numbers all got capped at 255, or if you just happened to post a file where every entry in the file is for patient 255. The data getting capped *shouldn't* happen, and I wasn't able to produce a scenario where the data was getting capped. So, all that said, here's the best I was able to do with your file: 255, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 15, 0, 2, 0, 1, 6968 255, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 13, 0, 1, 1, 3, 33915 255, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 7, 0, 1, 0, 3, 42427 255, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 19, 0, 1, 0, 2, 43937 255, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 15, 0, 2, 1, 1, 9548 255, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6, 8, 0, 2, 1, 2, 150125 255, 1, 1, 1, 7, 7, 8, 0, 2, 1, 2, 13647 255, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 5, 0, 1, 0, 3, 31829 255, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 15, 0, 1, 1, 3, 39534 255, 1, 1, 1, 10, 10, 5, 0, 2, 1, 3, 13439 255, 1, 1, 1, 11, 11, 7, 0, 1, 1, 4, 37111 255, 1, 1, 1, 12, 12, 10, 0, 1, 1, 4, 36544 255, 1, 1, 1, 13, 13, 11, 0, 1, 1, 4, 38836 255, 1, 1, 1, 14, 14, 5, 0, 2, 1, 5, 7892 255, 1, 1, 1, 15, 15, 5, 0, 1, 1, 6, 33534 255, 1, 1, 1, 16, 16, 5, 0, 2, 1, 6, 12783 255, 1, 1, 1, 17, 17, 4, 0, 1, 0, 4, 30438 This is the first 17 lines of your file. As you can see, the last two columns have been jammed into one. I don't know if this is recoverable for you or not. And again, too, if you had decimal precision for any of your numbers, that data is all gone, too. If this is useful to you, here's the code that generated it: fileID = fopen('D:\Medical_DM_904'); fileData = fread(fileID,'*char'); fclose(fileID); outData = strsplit(fileData.',newline); %% currentLine = 1; nColumnsMin = 13; nLinesMax = 20; while true myLine = outData{currentLine}; while true if numel(myLine)&lt;nColumnsMin*2-1 currentLine = currentLine + 1; myLine = [myLine,newline,outData{currentLine}]; else break; end end currentColumn = 1; nChar = numel(myLine); for i = 1:2:nChar if currentColumn&lt;=11 fprintf('%d, ',double(myLine(i))) else fprintf('%s',myLine(i)); end currentColumn = currentColumn + 1; end fprintf('\n'); currentLine = currentLine + 1; if currentLine &gt; nLinesMax break; end if currentLine &gt; numel(outData) break; end end The outer loop has to be a `while` loop because you can't jump the loop variable in a `for` loop. This is important to note because the inner loop checks for a minimum line length and continues to accumulate line segments until the minimum length is met. The reason for that is, when the data was written, all of your numbers were converted to characters. `char(10)` is the code for a new line. The script can't distinguish between a newline that was generated because it's actually the end of the data line and a newline that was generated because your data happened to be 10 at that particular point. Also, because you wrote a string, there is not a fixed number of columns. For example, line 1 ends `6968`, and line 2 ends `33915`. So instead, I figured there has to be at least 13 columns - 11 columns plus your two text lines. Assuming one character in each text string as the minimum gives 13 columns, and then there's a `char(9)` (tab) between each column, leading to the `nColumnsMin*2-1` as the escape condition for the inner loop. I hope this helps, and I'm sorry if your data is lost. I know (firsthand, unfortunately), what a devastating feeling it is :(
I can see boxes if I edit the post, but it looks like Reddit isn't displaying the boxes when I post. If you try the examples in Matlab, though, you should see everything. 
Seconded. Please do this 
[Relevant XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1425/)
Is there one that talks about Eigenvalues? 
This has almost nothing to do specifically with Matlab and everything to do with your knowledge of image recognition algorithms. With minimal programming experience, you absolutely will not be able to code any reasonable image recognition algorithm on your own. Sorry, but it's just the truth. Do you know about convolutional neural networks?
:)
[Yeah](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=xkcd+Eigenvalues+site%3Axkcd.com)
Damn i needed that laugh i forgot that website existed
If you want to talk in MATLAB terms, then yes, you could rewrite the second one as `dot(A,B)` but my guess is they are asking using generic math terminology because it's not a MATLAB specific question. 
Can you explain the question and answer to me? I'm having trouble finding resources.
so my initial code actually did work, all I need to do was add '.' before the * and the /. I didn't end up using the symsum. But thanks for your help
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product
Haha np :P
I understand what a dot product is (I hope), I'm just unfamiliar with that notation.
I'll gladly explain the question to you. I won't do your homework for you. It's asking if taking the matrix product of a column vector and a row vector is the same as taking a dot product between two vectors. 
Awesome, thanks a ton!
Thanks for the reply. Like I said, I don't have much experience with MATLAB. I don't know about convolutions neural networks. I just thought MATLAB had a bunch of "toolboxes" built in, and I didn't know if any of them dealt with image recognition and how it it would be to implement if they did. 
MATLAB does have toolboxes to help you on a task like this but it’s important to understand the structure of the math behind image recognition before delving into it. In other words it’s not a simple function that takes in training data and spits out decisions for new images. It’s slightly more involved. There are a couple pages on the Mathworks website about this — they are definitely trying to make work like this more accessible to people. If you Google “image recognition MATLAB” the first couple results should be really helpful in showing what’s required to get it done. 
Funny, this [exact question was asked last week](https://reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/78hvjs/need_help_with_question_regarding_systems_of/). To be frank with you, this is extremely basic. You firstly need to understand how to solve a system of equations by using matrix form. This is a linear algebra lesson, not Matlab. Once you understand this, implementing it in Matlab is quite trivial. If you have no idea where to start, I have no idea where to start with you. Do you know what a vector is? A matrix? If you have a system of equations, how do you convert to matrix form? How do you solve the matrix equation Ax = b?
Ok. Thanks again
I think the question is worded badly. It wants you to set x to a range, evaluate the *time* it takes to get to point C for each X, and then work out the minimum using min(). Simply initialise X=1:1:5000, then iterate through it calculating the time to point C (you'll need to work out the new diagonal distance each time), storing it in an array. Then use min() to find the smallest time and it's corresponding X. HTH
What did you try?
Ok well I understand that each value of y in (x,y) must correspond with the imput x value. I also know how to write vectors in matlab. However, I don't know how to convert the information I'm given into a matrix form or how to use that conversion to solve for the values of a b c and .
Have you tried adding a dot (.) to all your multiplication, division, and power signs (*, \, ^) to make Matlab do the calculations element wise?
This is how I originally started the question: x = 0:1:5000; r = 8.6 %RunSpeed s = 3.9 %SwimSpeed diagSwim = sqrt((x^2)+(300^2)) %using pythagorian theorem to find the diagonal distance after running to C t = ((10,000-x)/r) + (diagSwim/s) 
... I'm going to assume your username is relevant. I figured out how to dump the text to a file which I can then read into Matlab and parse.

I'll comment on your MATLAB, not the maths: Your implementation of t is close, but you want to calculate t for every element, so you need to use elementwise operators (i.e. put '.' in front of them.) That should (I'm away from computer at the moment, so not sure) give you an array of values of t. Then just use min() to find the minimum time. Otherwise, since computation time probably isn't a factor for you, preallocating an array of 1x5000 for t and filling in each value using a for loop would also work. 
[REMEMBER THIS](https://blogs.mathworks.com/images/cleve/shirt.jpg) 
How would you do it by hand? *What work have you done so far?*
The question that no OP ever answers.
What you basically should do is a [polynomial fit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_regression#Matrix_form_and_calculation_of_estimates). In this case, since you have no errors you can simply invert the matrix without doing the least-squares stuff.
You realize I wrote what I tried in the other reply right ? 
[removed]
So the initial function has five unknown constants, but you want four unknowns. So first write out the five equations (plug in the x value into all the x’s and calculate what they should be depending on their exponent, and plug in the y value for f(x)) and then compare the equations to each other. Can you find one of the constants off the bat? (I’m pretty sure you can find e but I’m not actually working it out so I could be wrong). Once you find one unknown set the five equations with the unknown value subbed in and “stack” them on top of each other (it helps visually). You’re then going to turn these equations into a matrix. The x^4 values will be your first column going down, your x^3 will be the next all the way down to e. That’s your first matrix. The second matrix you need to make is the y values. Your first matrix should have 5 rows and 5 columns, and the second matrix should have 5 rows and 1 column. Matrix syntax is A = [1 1 1; 2 2 2]. That example sets up a 2 x 3 matrix, you need to start and end with brackets and use semicolons to mark off new rows. Your two matrices are part of the equation Ax=b. The x is the matrix made by unknowns but you don’t need to crest one for that. To solve Ax=b you would then use the command x = A\b and the unknown values will come out in a 5x1 matrix that correspond to a-e. This isn’t really a hard problem, but I get that sometimes new problems look tricky and you just need help. I would really suggest working on some similar problems since I basically solved it for you otherwise you’ll get fucked on your test.
Is there a matlab function that determines the value of x at the minimum value of t?
[removed]
The last line in the loop is not necessary. MATLAB automatically increments the index in a for loop.
Which is why you're going over matrix dimensions. Also, why start your loop with 0, MATLAB starts indices at 1. 
I start at 0 so that the first P = [M(1) M(2)]
Ok so I took out the ii = ii +1 which helped but it still says Pii = [M(1) M(2)] Pii = [M(3) M(4)] where Pii keep getting overwrited.
Look up lagrangian interpolation function I think wiki has a good explanation. I'd link but I'm on phone
you're assigning a vector of length two to a single index of a vector, giving an error
No by hand. Write each equation about by hand so you can see what you’re putting into matlab. 
Look at the documentation for min. It can give you an index where t was minimal.
https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/78hvjs/need_help_with_question_regarding_systems_of/ This deleted topic has exactly the same question, only deleted. A student colleague of yours?
`Pii` keeps being overwritten because you keep telling MATLAB to overwrite it. If you have a variable and you assign a new value to that variable, it will be overwritten. What you want is an `nx2` array, where each row of your array is one of your `M(1) M(2)` pairings. Do you know how to index a multidimensional array? For instance, you can say `A(2,4)` which would mean the second row and fourth column of an array `A`. Also, if you use the `:` operator, it means "all of the elements in this dimension." So `A(2,:)` would be "all of the elements of row 2." If you knew A was an `nx2` array, you could write `A(2,:) = [x, y]` which would assign the second row of `A` to the array `[x,y]`. Does this help you see what you need to do? 
very good http://www.matlabprozhe.com/
There is not a direct method (that I know of), but something like this should work: max_val = max(a); max_ind = find(a == max_val); rand_ind = randi(length(max_ind), 1);
Hey! It's me again. Could you please explain what the function "pp_darc2 = dl_squared(pp)" you wrote for me above does? It's perfect, but I have to write about it and I am not sure what each step does. Furthermore, why is: dl1 = sqrt(ppval(ppdl1,xi)); Same for dl2. Isn't the formula for distance between two points on a curve: int(sqrt(1+(dy/dx)), x, x1, x2); %? Thanks a ton :)
Thx so much. If I want to get index/position of the randomly chosen max-values, i would have to do: max_ind( randi(length(max_ind), 1) ) right? 
Ah yeah. Sorry missed the last step. You're correct
Why does it need to be in MATLAB? I'd suggest using something like openCV, even if you run it from MATLAB which is supported AFAIK.
No. If you read pretty much any scientific literature that involves computational data analysis, they usually just list somewhere that they used Matlab and behind it they put the city mathworks is in parentheses.
Seconded. Also I rarely ever see anyone write it MATLAB even if that is how MathWorks styles it. It's usually "We used Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA)" like you said. (And definitely don't write it MatLab, that's a noob error.)
No. And secondly, it's not a copyright, you dunce. If you wanted to use the right symbol it would be ®.
 iskeyword('else') == 1 Will always return true no matter what, because the string 'else' contains a keyword. But besides that I don't understand what you are trying to achieve with this code, so simplifying it seems impossible.
It's just a question for my class where he is asking us to simplify it, so I don't know.
Well, if the if statement always evaluates to true then there is no need to actually have an if statement there? So in other words you can simplify this code to 1 line with the same behavior. I'll let you decide on how to do that.
For the loglog portion of your question, that is as simple as using loglog(X,Y) the same way you use the plot() function. For adding multiple step sizes, you can just store the data from multiple and then use hold on immediately after plotting the first one and then use loglog() again for the next step size. Example: Say h=1:2 X and Y are the values from your numerical method with different columns referring to different step sizes loglog(X(:,1),Y(:,1)) %plots the first step size hold on %keeps your original plot and let's you add another line to it loglog(X(:,2),Y(:,2)) %plots the second step size hold off %makes it so no new plots can be added Then legend, title, and axis stuff.
I am not sure how you an input this in to Matlab and hold more than one value of h?
for i = 1:N NewC = [NewC NewColumn]; end Where NewC is your vertical vector of size Mx1 turning into a matrix of size MxN+1, and NewColumn has the values you want to add in the matrix. I hope that helps.
It would help if you posted the code in question.
Ode45, look it up, wonderful tool
 if subject(1).(property) == 20 I finally figured it out, I just had to put parentheses.
You sure it is not some add-on or custom functions messing you up? Try `which legend` to locate the function
Second line, you're clearing your function workspace. So you're deleting all your input arguments.
You could try cell arrays{}. These are different from matrices because each cell can hold a different type of variable. This is helpful for you because step size changes the number of elements in the x and y arrays and you are able to store the arrays into individual cells. Try this: %set step sizes Step=1:5 %iterate through step sizes For s =1:length(Step) h=Step(s) %generate x based on step size Xvec = [0:h:1] %Load it to your x cell array Xcell{s}=Xvec % iterate through x to generate y For i = 1: length (Xvec) X=Xvec(i) Yvec(i)=f(X) End %load complete y vector in to y cell array Ycell{s} = Yvec %clear old x and y vectors clearvars Yvec Xvec end %plot on loglog scale %start figure figure(1) For p =1:length(Step) %plotting function loglog() loglog(Xcell{p},Ycell{p}) %keep previous plots hold on End %stop plotting Hold off %do formatting stuff
do you want to solve equations symbolically or numerically? do you know how to convert a system to matrix form?
without more context for the assignment it's hard to help for what's being asked. but generally people want to see the actual output from matlab after running code and not some English-language summary of what you got.
based on your post history, you are incapable of learning things and attempting something on your own.

You have made a variable called ‘legend’ which is being indexed instead of calling the legend function. If you do ‘clear legend’ and try again it should work. Side note - this is one of the big fundamental design issues in Matlab (as in, unlikely they’ll ever fix it), which is that both function calls and array indexing use () whereas other languages like Python use () for calling functions and [] for indexing arrays. So bottom line is that in Matlab you always need to think twice about whether () is indexing or calling. In this case, the error message is what should tip you off
Here is the question https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/109784-need-help-creating-a-function-m-file-for-the-bisection-method-for-the-following-equation I'm just unsure what it means by a complete documented lsiting of MATLAB files and actual output from MATLAB, do I just copy and paste all my code and the M file names? 
thanks for that, I've moved it but I'm still getting the same error. 
For non stiff problems ode45 is the go to solver. For stuff problems try ode15s or ode23s. 
[removed]
Are you handing `dom` into the function when you call it?
Numerically, and no I don't :( Any tips would be appreciated 
1) learn how to write differential equations in matrix form 2) read up on mathworks documentation for solving ODEs. Google “numerically solve differential equation Matlab” and you’ll get a ton of results
Theirs to many of you stuff guys floating around get a life.
We all have lives because we know how to think for ourselves and solve problems. But nice one, very edgy. What’s the over/under on how long you stay in math fields before realizing you can’t handle it?
Not in a math field just a shitty class on a degree track
thank god I hope you never have to solve a problem that actually affects people in the real world
Yea because it's not like people make their own way in life without school or anything.
then why are you on a degree track when you clearly can't think for yourself?
I guess it's just a robot typing these responses, but nice one tho 
moved? you should remove the clear command. In this context it makes no sense to use it.
Howdy again, So let's start with the end of your post and work backwards! You said... &gt; Isn't the formula for distance between two points on a curve: &gt; int(sqrt(1+(dy/dx)), x, x1, x2); %? But that's not quite right, you're missing a squared term on the (dy/dx) . You can work it out from trig with dl as your hypotenuse, i.e. dl^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 = (1 + (dy/dx )^2) dx^2 dl/dx = sqrt(1 + (dy/dx)^2) l = int(sqrt(1 + (dy/dx)^2), x, x1, x2) Make sense? This leads us to your second question... basically polynomials are easy to use, but square roots of polynomials less so. So it's easier to calculate something like (dl/dx)^2 rather than (dl/dx) to avoid having to deal with the square root. This is essentially what I did, I wrote a function which returns (dl/dx)^2 and then to get your dl you square root it and multiply by your 'dx' distance... hence: dl1 = sqrt(ppval(ppdl1,xi)); This is using ppval to look up (dl/dx)^2 at all the points in the xi vector. Then we square root it to get dl/dx. Make sense? The first part of your question was how does the dl_squared function work. So essentially what this function does is given a set of polynomials which interpolate your surface [i.e. y = fn(x)] it then returns a different set of polynomials which interpolate (dl/dx)^2 on your surface [i.e. (dl/dx)^2 = fn(x)]. To do this we use the formular for (dl/dx)^2 which we came up with earlier i.e. (dl/dx)^2 = 1 + (dy/dx)^2 To get dy/dx we differentiate. So first I extract the polynomial coefficients. Let's say the first polynomial on your surface is: 11*x^3 + 7*x^2 + 5*x + 3 We want to differentiate this to get: 0*x^3 + 33*x^2 + 14*x + 5 If you think about how polynomial differentiation works you'll see that we can do this by multiplying the matrix of coefficients by the following matrix: M = [0 3 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0]; i.e. [11 7 5 3]*M = [0 33 14 5] This is what I a doing in the line: dcoefs = coefs*diag(k-1:-1:1,1); So we have the coefficients for (dy/dx) now, but we need (dy/dx)^2. If you were doing this on pen and paper you'd probably expand the brackets by multiplying every possible pair of coefficients. You won't have learnt it yet, but this is actually a type of "convolution". Essentially you can find the product of two polynomials by convolving their coefficients, this is something you'll likely address at university. But essentially that's all that the following line means: dcoefs2(ip,:) = conv(dcoefs(ip,2:end),dcoefs(ip,2:end)); i.e. the coefficients for the ip'th squared polynomial is the convolution of the coefficients of the ip'th polynomial convolved with itself. I also specified to ignore the first coefficients (e.g. the cubed term in our example) because we know that after differentiation it will always be zero. Make sense? We then just add one to each polynomial, as per our formula coefs_dl2 = dcoefs2 + [zeros(1,2*k -4) 1]; And then were done, the last line in this function with "mkpp" is just telling Matlab to reform our set of polynomials into a piecewise polynomial so you can evaluate it using the function ppval. Hopefully that made sense, sorry I'm a bit out of it atm but will happily clarify anything you didn't catch tomorrow!

okay so basically I want to define r such that it's like a (however many timesteps there are) x 3 array so that the 1st column is x values (with the time step being the elements of the columns (i.e., the rows)) and the 2nd column is y and the third is z. Correct? How exactly would I go about doing this? Could I create a column vector for the timestep and then concatenate it with a row vector like f = [x,y,x] and get what's desired?
Oh yea! After clear legend, it worked! Haha thank you! Oh and previously I had some problems with ode45 where I had another user defined function which I named the same as another function that ode45 uses in its calculations resulting in an error. How do I know in that case that it is a function that I made causing the error and why would my function override matlabs pre defined functions?
Is the text file a comma separated file? If not, `csvread` is not the correct function to use.
MATLAB can sense weakness and fear. Sometimes a code will work flawlessly, you save it and go to bed feeling good about yourself. You wake up the next day and it gives you an error on line 7 of 1786. You spend the rest of the day debugging your code that worked yesterday. Welcome to hell, aka MATLAB. But really though. Could be lots of things, we need more specifics to help. 
I'd send you the code but I don't think that's the problem as it works perfectly now. So I don't know what other details I could provide. 
chances are it's one of the following: 1) you didn't change the directory or add the folder that contains the function to the "path", so Matlab doesn't know what function you're talking about. 2) You didn't run a script that created the variable you tried to access, so the variable didn't exist.
In your code you're actually trying to set A(1) equal to I, not I is equal to A(1). Matlab always sets the left equal to the right, switch up those 4 statements.
How are you running the code? F5 in the script file while it's open, or typing the function into the command window? If it's the latter I would also suggest that your function is not on the PATH when you fail to run it. As mentioned in the other comment. If it doesn't work again, open the script and run it with F5.
Full error is: Reference to a cleared variable dom. Error in AB31 (line 12) T = diff(dom); % This is time domain for which you're solving for, i.e. 2-0 = 2. &gt;&gt; [y, t, h] = AB31([-1,2], @(t, y) -3*y+6*t+5, 2*exp(3)-1 , 39.1592, 39.1474, 10.^-4) Error: File: AB31.m Line: 11 Column: 22 Function with duplicate name "AB31" cannot be defined.
I have moved it to above the function shouldn't that be okay?
or 2b) Misspelling a variable name, and then fixing it in some places. this also causes a variable to not exist 
First, determine the steps you want your code to do [precisely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDA3_5982h8). Then use [smart websites](https://www.google.nl/search?dcr=0&amp;source=hp&amp;ei=0vr2WcaLA8TXwAKb9bO4DQ&amp;q=matlab+YOURSTEPHERE&amp;oq=matlab+YOURSTEPHERE&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...1186.8237.0.8528.31.30.1.0.0.0.138.2440.21j9.30.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.29.2223...0j0i131k1j0i10k1j0i22i30k1j33i160k1.0.eyEJbKGtvVk) to help you make those steps. After all is done and you have some code and you're still stuck, share that and we might be willing to help. There's a sidebar here too, if you care to read it.
I would look into the functions: input disp you'll also have to do some if/else loops for the input and giving the user feedback
quick and dirty way; add a loop around the whole thing over different values for h, and use hold on to not erase the figure you've drawn.
How can I do that?
aaa, its a function . In that case in the command window you can go hA = [1 2 3]; figure(1); hold on ; for ih = 1 : numel(hA) h = hA(hi) AB32(dom, f, F, F2, F3, h, G) end
Try GUIDE. You can make a GUI with four different axes handles, add buttons to change/clear plot parameters, etc. As long as the plots aren't updating in real-time, it should be okay. GUIs can get bogged down pretty quickly when plotting real-time data.
Alright. There will not be any real-time data being plotted. All my data is already saved in memory. Can I ask why I should use GUIDE over App Designer?
I mean, if you are making it work with App Designer, I would just stick with it. I don't have much experience with it, but it looks like its got some expanded functionality relative to GUIDE. GUIDE is super simple and easy to use with auto-generated callback functions in an associated m-file. You could do what you are after with four axes, some drop-down menus, and something like "plot now" buttons.
[why would you ask us that](https://www.google.nl/search?q=Can+you+train+your+Neural+Network+using+GPU%27s+on+MATLAB%3F&amp;oq=Can+you+train+your+Neural+Network+using+GPU%27s+on+MATLAB%3F&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.79j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) ?
thanks, I am putting this into the command window and getting the following error: Undefined function or variable 'hi'.
I made a typo. I could tell you, but then were would your sense of accomplishment be :p
If you name your own function the same as a matlab function AND you are working in the directory with that function, the matlab function will be overridden. This makes it easy to write a "shim", or a wrapper around the matlab function that does maybe more error checking, or fills in default arguments, or something. 
Please see [our rules for submitting homework](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/462uwe/submitting_homework_questions_read_this/). 
Isit h(i)? I've spent days on it this, skipping classes in other modules to try and get it completed :/. Thanks for your help aswell btw 
I added this in to my command window and am only getting a single point plotted for the graph, found the error and switched 'for ih' to 'for hi' Command used hA = [1 2 3]; figure(1); hold on ; for hi = 1 : numel(hA) h = hA(hi) [y, t, h] = AB32([-1,2], @(t, y) -3*y+6*t+5, 2*exp(3)-1 , 39.1592, 39.1474, 10.^-4, @(t) 2*exp(-3*t)+2*t+1) end
An issue with App designer is that it is relatively new, so not everything is supported yet. For instance last time I used it there seemed to be no easy way(Or any way for that matter) to update a plot instead you would need to replot all the data. This was a concern if you wanted to animate a plot, but maybe in your case this is not a big deal. Other than that I liked App designer and it was very easy to use. App designer can also make figures that can be opened without matlab which is neat. GUIDE has been around for longer, is more mature and has more functionality. But in my opinion App designer is easier to use and produces nicer looking GUIs by default. I would make sure that App designer supports what you want to do and stick to that. Another possibility is to use python with tkinter, I have used that with great success in the past.
Your code is really hard to understand in this format. Put it into pastebin and add the link to your post.
Thank you! Was easier than expected. Google failed me &gt;.&gt;
use the h in the command windows workspace as in input to the function, so probably in the place of 10.-4. 
my plot is very off, this is what I am getting (https://imgur.com/a/b09Ea). Any idea on what could be wrong?
^(Hi, I'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image) **https://i.imgur.com/H1Iy1z6.png** ^^[Source](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot) ^^| ^^[Why?](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot/blob/master/README.md) ^^| ^^[Creator](https://np.reddit.com/user/AUTplayed/) ^^| ^^[ignoreme](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&amp;subject=ignoreme&amp;message=ignoreme) ^^| ^^[deletthis](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&amp;subject=delet%20this&amp;message=delet%20this%20dp3x36a) 
So I decided to browse around numpy and scypy documentation and found function expand. It exists also in matlab, so I keep looking further.
Just write a for loop to iterate over the length of the phone number. At each step extract the number from the input string, convert to a number (str2num) and then play the sound 
Without knowing what the real question you are asking is, you might look into the .* method instead of just * for multiplication. But that will not fix the so called boolean algebra ( not sure thats what its called, but I haven't been in school for a while). Other than that, could you try to re-ask the question? 
so first of all your function really isn't written in the traditional way. your function should return some variable, then the user can decide if they'd want to suppress output with a semicolon. secondly, you have numerous warnings over your code that you should fix. hover your cursor over the warning lines to see what's going wrong. you have a couple things that need fixing. thirdly, 'find' returns the indices of where x is less than or greater than 4. you just need to obtain these indices and then use them to obtain the corresponding values from x, like: output = zeros(size(x)); output(find(x&lt;4)) = x(find(x&lt;4)); output(find(x&gt;=4)) = x(find(x&gt;=4))/2; this code is not written in the optimal form but it's written in a way that I hope you can see what it's doing. you should be careful because the instructions are pretty clear that you should be finding where *x is 4 or greater* (i.e., &gt;= not just &gt;)
I’m not at my desk to test this right now, but make the other window you want, then in the primary window, make a call with a pushbutton or what-have-you load() or open() directed at the new window. Basically make two guis, then call the second from the first.
the answer you got is basically a hack and I wouldn't advise it, my advice would be to use a GUI with different tabs: [see UITAB](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/uitab.html)
Thanks Google. Now how do I train my neural network with Matlab? /s
yes
+123abc-123xyz &lt; I dont know if i did that right? how exactly do I go about doing that. I looked up how to iterate over the lengths and extracting the numbers and it just gets me nowhere, I keep getting to where I started. https://pastebin.com/btuMVjch
You're iterating on the variable i, but calling str2num() and Lab8() on the variable x.
+_Sayeth_ I changed it to be variable i but i'm still having trouble actually getting the value from each individual number so i can run in Lab8 
You need to think about what your function inputs are. You want the input to Lab8, n, to be a single digit. You also need it to be a number, not a string. So you need to convert you phone number, x, from a number to a string, then take an individual element of that string, convert it back into a number, and pass it into your Lab8() function. Look up array indexing for grabbing pieces of a string.
Why not look at the Matlab documentation? 
what is uniformity?
Matlab has a very complete image processing toolbox. If you are interested in measuring the physical characteristics of objects in your image (grass height for instance), I would recommend using some image segmentation/thresholding function to classify features of your image. Then you can analyze height each column at a time. The tricky part would be distinguishing each blade of grass from another but you can figure that out with a little research.
Please see our [rules for submitting homework questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/462uwe/submitting_homework_questions_read_this/)
Uniformity (or evenness) of the cut. A flat plane created by the blades would be defined as the mathematical definition of a perfect cut.
where are you struggling, what don't you understand? this is a pretty simple function to write if you think about it
you need to define uniformity more rigorously than that.
Matlab for neural networks, R for pretty figures. Or Python for neural networks if you’re going to start from scratch anyway. 
Btw, the error refers to the line &gt;Msgbox(msg) I'll also gladly take any tips on making the code better, please ignore the notes, I have no idea what im doing. 
Fix the CSV files, check for formatting issues 
On mobile, but it looks a simple way to fix this could be to move the end of the first for-loop to include all of your code. You may need to use ‘hold on’ so the plot doesn’t redraw itself on each iteration. You could also make h an input, return the error, and move the plotting out of the function. Then just call your function in a loop for different h’s and save the resulting error so you can call plot. Good luck! 
Thanks for the answer, could I have a push button open a secondary tab, while hiding the tab bar?
Take a look at textscan(). Import the file line by line and see if the data you are looking for is present, then put that into a cell or array. Or you could also scan a block of the csv file at a time. 
Your explanations are crystal clear. This is genius. Thank you so much for all the time you have spent helping me. If I still find anything not too clear, I will surely ask.
So could I use this in the command function: for k = 1:5 H = 10.^-(1:0.5:4) h = H(k) [y, t, h] = AB32([-1,2], @(t, y) -3*y+6*t+5, 2*exp(3)-1 , 39.1592, 39.1474, 10^-4, @(t) 2*exp(-3*t)+2*t+1) end But where would I write hold on so it plots multiple values?
My guesses, you made a typo in the formula, or you treat strings as numbers and or vice versa. It's also much easer for us to help you if you share your code. 
https://imgur.com/a/B3UUX Note I was testing something and forgot to change output variable back to z before posting. So in the set() function, the var should be z.

You are only setting `msg` when it is inside of an `if` statement- if your conditional is never met then `msg` doesn't get set. Try having an `else` statement which says `no solution found` or something, and then you'll know the problem is with your root finding algorithm. 
what is the variable type of input? that is what is returned by the get(...,'string')?
That is because `get(handles.edit1, 'string')` returns a character vector. So if you input `10`, you get the character vector `'10'` (which is sometimes called a "string" in MATLAB, even though a `string` is a different data type). MATLAB character vectors are literally that: vectors of characters, so `['1', '0']` in this case. Internally, these two characters are stored as a pair of numbers uniquely identifying each character, and those numbers are not equal to the numeric value of the character. For the characters `'1'` and `'0'`, it will generally be `48` and `49`, respectively. So when you try to do math on the character vector `'10'`, MATLAB actually does the math on the numeric vector `[48, 49]`, giving you two results. The result depends on the characters you enter, but will almost certainly result in the wrong value. What you need to do is something like `input = str2double(get(handles.edit1, 'string'))`. The `str2double` will convert that character vector `'10'` to the actual numeric value `10`. `str2num` will also, but `str2double` is better in this case than `str2num` since it will always return a single value (or an `NaN` for invalid values, which you should check for), and prevents users from inputting unsafe values that could mess up your calculation or even your computer. For the future it is preferable to use something like [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) for sharing code since it lets us try it, search it, etc.
A character vector is returned.
You basically just click modules you want to add and tweak to code to behave how you want. Add a blank set of axes then plot your contour there. 
What isn't working? Are you using `uifigure` to create the plots instead of `figure`? Also, you must manually create the `uiaxes` object manually and pass that manually to all your plotting-related functions (so everything you linked to besides the `figure` call, which again should be a `uifigure`). See [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_guis/graphics-support-in-app-designer.html) for more info and some examples. Make sure to read all the way to the bottom since it explains some additional details.
I am not using uifigure right now. All I have done is written the code for each individual plot in my main source code and then I opened up App Designer and added "Axes" hoping to be able to add my contour plot there but I can't type anything into the code view. EDIT: I changed figure to uifigure...my contour plot appears as well as a separate window with nothing on it. EDIT 2:I guess uifigure is how you program apps programmatically. I'll continue working with this.
“A challenging Matlab problem...” [X Y] = meshgrid(D1,D2) To get a certain point from the grid: x = X(2,3); y = Y(2,3); And so on. You’ll probably need to map a ... e to numbers and then back to the corresponding letters. 
MATLAB preferably uses linear indexing, rather than a coordinate grid. Create a Matrix distortion where each column represents options of Distortion 1 and each row represents options of Distortion 2. Many ways to do so; D1 = [1,2,3,4,5]; D2 = [1;1;1;1;1]; distortion = D2*D1; Now Input Whichever distortion you want; say distortion(2,3); Ix = sub2ind(size(distortion),2,3); distortion(Ix); % This will be you chosen distortion option. Hope this helps in some distorted sense. 
Can you share your actual code? I did (what I think) you are describing, and `fzero` worked without any problem. But without seeing your code, I can't figure out what is causing you problems. 
You must have tspan defined as a function somewhere, causing Matlab to get confused when functions/scripts are calling tspan as a variable. 
Sure, thanks for taking the time. function [xp, yp] = Sp() %Returns the point where f1 and f2 intersect x = -2*pi:0.01:4*pi; f1 = (2\*x); %Defines the first equation f2 = (0.5\*x+2); %Defines the second equation f3 = f1-f2; %Formulate the problem in such a manner that fzero can be used hold on; plot (x, f1); %visual control for results plot (x, f2); fun = @(x) (f3); %Here's the problem x0 = 0; xp = fzero(fun, x0); yp = 2\*(xp); 
The problem is you didn't make `f1` and `f2` functions- you made them arrays. Then, `f3` is also an array, and is not a function of `x`. If you were to instead do this: f1 = @(x) 2*x f2 = @(x) x/2 + 2 f3 = @(x) f1(x) - f2(x) then things will work as you intend. 
+ Thanks a lot! Seems like I hadn't really understood what a function is in Matlab, but your explanation set that straight. Now how do I "start the reply with a plus sign"? Reddid keeps converting it into a dot.
As I said, you need to pass the resulting uifigure object as an argument to all the other lines of the code you posted.
You probably want to use [ndgrid](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ndgrid.html) in this case. With meshgrid you get that funky dimension flipping, which seems like it would be a hindrance here rather than a help. you could also do something like: [X1 X2]=ndgrid(D1,D2); X=permute(cat(3,X1,X2),[3 1 2]); Values can then be accessed by using something like: % vals_cur = [x_val; y_val] vals_cur=X(:,2,3)
so to put it in words, you did the first line to create a vector the size of the inputted vector. Then for the second line, for the spots where x&lt;4 on x, you put those values on output? (same for x&gt;=4, just half)
yeah
Here's a version of the second approach I mentioned: for k = 1:5 h(k) = 10.^-k [y, t, err(k)] = AB32([-1,2], @(t, y) -3*y+6*t+5, 2*exp(3)-1 , 39.1592, 39.1474, @(t) 2*exp(-3*t)+2*t+1, h(k)); end loglog(h, err); function [y, t, err] = AB32(dom, f, F, F2, F3, G, h) T = diff(dom); % This is length of the time interval for which you're solving for, i.e. 2-0 = 2. N = ceil(T/h); % total number of times steps h = T/N; % Preallocations: t = zeros(N+1, 1); y = zeros(N+1, 1); % Initializations: y(1) = F; % Initial value of the ODE IVP % Compute the solution at t = h by using the true solution: t(2) = -1+h; %To allow the process to start at t =-1 y(2) = F2; t(3) = -1+(2*h); %To allow the process to start at t =-1 y(3) = F3; % Main loop for marching N steps: for i = 3:N t(i+3) = -1+(i-1)*h; % time points y(i+3) = y(i+2) + (h/12)*(23*f(t(i+2), y(i+2)) - (16*f(t(i+1), y(i+1))) + 5*f(t(i), y(i))); % 3-step Adams-Bashforth method!!! %Find Error in Estimation err = (abs(y(i+3)-G(i+3))); end end Cheers!
If you want to pass all the outputs as one cell array, just do that. I'm not sure why you're trying to wrap a function in a concatenate. Maybe you can provide an example of how this would be useful? I can't imagine the scenario where this is the preferable way to solve the problem. That said, if you *were* going to concatenate inside the function, you can check to see how many outputs are being requested. Consider something like: function varargout = DummyFun(varargin) if nargout == 0 % Wrap your outputs into a cellArray varargout{1} = cellArray; else % Assign outputs normally varargout{1} = outputVar1; varargout{2} = outputVar2; % ... etc. end end

For trading, you may want to consider something else. There are some C like scripting languages for Meta trader 4 for example which let you set up automated trading within the platform itself. I guess it depends how far into the trading thing you're going. If it's just analyzing data for now, stick with MATLAB. Id be curious to collaborate a little if you don't mind working together. I've just recently started learning FOREX trading and want to implement a neural network to trade with. I'm still in the extreme early learning stages though.
[The book's solution. I'm not sure how they converted to matrix form. Did they use kirchoff's current law?](https://imgur.com/a/4bv4d)
I already know more or less what I want to do. I've been trading crypto for over 4 years now, and have already compiled a list of indicators that I want to build my neural network around. The network itself isn't going to be that difficult to create, and I won't be automating any trades because the volatility is a bit too high for me to walk away from. So yes, it's definitely going to be more on the analysis side. Getting a swing trading bot going on a crypto exchange has a huge startup cost, I can go into it in more detail if you'd like, but high frequency trades incur a lot of exchange fees. If you're just getting started with trading I'd say fuck FOREX and go into BTC or ETH. Way more money to be made.
They literally just rewrite the four equations written into matrix form. Multiply out the matrix by the current vector. You’ll notice that each row is exactly equal to one of the four equations. edit: [here's a link to a lesson on rewriting equations in to matrix form](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/precalc-matrices/solving-equations-with-inverse-matrices/e/writing-systems-of-equations-as-matrix-equations). this really should be a prerequisite before using Matlab to solve systems.
[this exact question was asked a day ago](https://reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/79qmbu/changing_specific_elements_in_vectors/) and looking at your code, it is littered with errors all over the place. I'd recommend familiarizing yourself with 1) how functions work in Matlab, 2) how to assign variables, 3) the proper syntax for a for-loop, and 4) the use of semicolons. you query y in the initialization of the for-loop in a way that doesn't make sense. and you can't do things like "7&lt;=y&lt;20"
Sorry, I'm still learning how to use the program. Thanks for the help.
This is the correct answer. OP, you are making this more complicated than it is! 
is the professor of your course assigning questions like this for students with truly 0 hours of matlab coding experience? it seems like a lot of the people in your course have been struggling
Idk if its just me, I have no experience coding before this so I really struggle to follow along when he teaches 
matlab is a coding language, so you need to figure out how to interpret this into code that matlab can read (i.e., you don't just type equations into matlab and expect it to solve them). first, the problem is asking about steady states. what does steady state mean? you should know the answer to this. using this knowledge part of the equation can be simplified (what can we say about d/dt(p(t))?) once you have the steady state equation, you can now think about how to tell matlab to solve this equation. it sounds like your professor wants an explicit solution, not a numerical one. matlab can work with symbolic expressions (i.e., it can solve equations with/without numbers in terms of other variables). check out [this page on solving algebraic equations in matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/solve-an-algebraic-equation.html), they have examples of solving equations similar to yours. that's basically all there is to it. you're going to have two equations to solve, one for the unregulated equation which will allow you to solve for p_ss_unreg, and another equation for the regulated model that will allow you to solve for p_ss_reg. for example: syms x beta k equation1 = beta*x-(x-1)/k == 0; % (note how the '=' is used for assignment of the variable 'equation1' and '==' is used to indicate 'equals to' in our equation) solution_for_x = solve(equation1, x); disp(solution_for_x); running this returns: solution_for_x = -1/(beta*k-1) Now, *if he wants you to solve this system numerically to confirm that the solution approaches the right steady states*, that is more open-ended. [see this page for solving a differential equation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/solve-a-single-differential-equation.html). you could solve the equation for a range of values and then show that asymptotic behavior of the solution approaches the right value.

So you rewrite the equation with v on the right hand side, then multiply out the brackets. Matrices multiply row by column, so everything in the first column is the coefficients of i1, the second column is i2 etc. Each row is a separate equation.
What have you tried? What part of the documentation wasn't clear? It's easier to help if you tell us what isn't clear. 
I wonder what the documentation says about it? 
Im total noob i dont know how to express belongs to or delta . It would be great if you wrote the script Thanks 
We won't do your homework for you. This is very simple to do by reading the documentation. Why don't you try that?
fair enough . 
&gt; The weird thing is that this is totally doable with an anonymous function: &gt; &gt; anonSpread = @(arr)mat2cell(arr, 1, ones(1, numel(arr))){:}; That **is** weird, but because it errors for me. Most of what you say you tried errors for me. This is a Matlab subreddit - are you asking about *Matlab* or are you asking about *Octave*? I ask because your `endfunction` lines are not commands in Matlab. :EDIT: I'll add, too, that I'm not sure why you're trying to pack inputs like this. If you're going to bother to make a variable that has all of the required inputs to `linspace` (or whatever else), why not just call `linspace` instead of creating `c`? What purpose does `c` serve? 
There's a built-in function that does this already. Another user showed it to me when I posted essentially the same thing. I'll see if I can find the post. :EDIT: [Here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/72i0zm/homework_isempty_and_default_values/dnj9bv9/). The function is called [inputparser](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/inputparser.addoptional.html). Thanks /u/Weed_O_Whirler !
I'm an idiot. Thanks so much!
I understand now, thanks a lot man!
Thanks :O, I didn't know that function, it's gonna be handy when the input validation and type checking are necesairy. But, I argue that it's not as fun. Default values have to be supplied using inpp = inputParser ; addOptional(inpp,'foo',3) ; Which has the downside of using the parameter as a string, which the m-lint doesn't warn you about ([also its ugly](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/inputparser.parse.html#mw_7f957987-1f17-489b-b3b1-b6699fa06919)). But you can achieve the same "one time defining" of your parameter by declaring them in the current workspace using for instance fn = fieldnames(inpp.Results) ; for pai = 1 : numel(fn) eval([fn{pai} '=' num2str(inpp.Results.(fn{pai})) ';'] ); end after parse, which is no improvement wrt my concoction.
These statements mean that X is a list, from -5 to 5, with a step size (Delta) of 0.05. It seems like you are from a place where comma and period are transposed in mathematical usage - in comparison with North American usage. I’m not sure if there is a regional setting in Matlab that will accommodate this, or if you will need to adjust your syntax within Matlab.
True, but I think the Matlab built-in functions let you use partial strings, as long as the partial string results in only one match. I've never (would never) use partial strings for name/value pairs (I'm not *that* lazy), but someone else could, if they wanted. 
I'd love some more details... any reason why BTC or ETH (or cryptos) are better than FOREX? From my research (only been looking into this for about 3 weeks now) it seems that FOREX would be the most fair market to trade in using any sort of analysis due to the volume and lack of any 'major player' so to speak. Is there something I'm missing? :). Feel free to PM me if this isn't the best place to talk.
I mean FOREX is definitely more stable, early adopters and hedge funds have a huge advantage in crypto, but this will be true in any market. Volume is not a concern because the 24 hour trade volume in the crypto space is comparable to the 24 hour FANGG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix etc...) volume (at peak). Hedge funds are really starting to move into crypto now, but there is still a lot of dumb money in crypto vs FOREX. The price swings (short time frames) are much larger and easier to time than FOREX, with the only downside being the propensity for "dumps". Combined with the general increase in perceived value of the space and you have what is currently the world's hottest market. It's not really for the faint of heart though, as tech cycles in the space are faster than anything I've ever seen. One month is equivalent to 6 months of development time in the traditional tech space. There are tons of scams, but there are some quality products that will persist through this uncertainty. I mean I'm obviously a biased source, but as someone who has traded through massive bear cycles and euphoric bull cycles, there's simply no investment that can outperform crypto over the next few years (as long as you don't speculate on ALT coins). As for the analysis side, the biggest reason that I don't want to automate trades is that I'm not confident in my work. Open up the market data for the last 4 months of any major exchange. GDAX is widely considered to be the best and most stable of the Western exchanges, and has all the features that professional traders want. Even on GDAX you have a combination of some poor trading engine mechanics and brain dead traders. A few months ago someone market sold 32 million worth of ETH during a period of low volume and crashed the market for a few seconds. Everyone who was stuck in a long position got liquidated and crashed the market from $320 --&gt; 10 cents. Even if this happens for one second, this is all it takes to wipe you out. 
depends on how clean your data is. matlab is built for signal analysis and has tools built-in to handle this with the fft function, [see this forum post.](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/114698-finding-out-phase-shift-in-time-domain-from-fft-result) you could programmatically find where each signal reaches it's maximum values, then find the average distance between where the two signals achieve their maximums within your measurement range. this could be done heuristically without the need of a fourier transform. or, you could be more sophisticated if the data is messy and use a fourier transform combined with a maximum-likelihood algorithm to compute the phase shift that is most likely to result in your observed data.
do you not have a lot of RAM or something? i can't imagine that a 10x16384 would be too large for a built-in function to handle, especially a function like xcorr which is designed for this edit: evidently if you feed xcorr a Y x X matrix it needs to handle a 32 x X x X matrix which will get very big lol your other option is to do each of the pairwise correlations for your 10 columns separately instead of feeding them all at once.
Great, I will go give that a shot and see what I can do!
okay, so if i do: for n = 1:10 [acn,lagn] = xcorr(p); plot(lagn,acn) hold on end that works but how would I combine the correlations into one single one?
Ok, this will not be a zero-phase filter unless you use the filtfilt function. Your code works for me just fine, without NaNs, so maybe check if anything in your data is a NaN: try &gt; sum(isnan(data)) which should come out to zero.
Yeah I just posted the filter design function. When I use the filtfilt function, all of my output values are NaN instead of having a smoothed curve of my data. Whereas the filter function works, but there's the shift in the data to the left.
That's odd. [This code](https://pastebin.com/xbniNXVh) works for me. Does it work for your data? (swapping d out for your data)
I tried the code near identical, but it still shows up as "NaN".
And, the code works fine as written, without using your own data?
Cool! Thanks a lot for all this info. I'm an engineer with 0 financial education outside econ 101 but a lot of state estimation background - modelling random processes. From a brief "literature review", it does seem that FOREX is not a truly random process and thus can be exploited with automatic trading. How is still a research project for me, but neural networks with pattern recognition seems to be what I'm converging to. I can't comment on things outside FOREX as I have not done the research yet. Thanks again.
did you just give up without even thinking about it?
Yeah. It's weird. Going to look into that
Ok, so I kept working on the data and am pretty sure it is clean enough to use fft but now I'm running into the issue of not knowing how to code it. I have some confusion in how to correctly import the csv data (csvread works in the workspace but not .m file) and so on. Any chance you could give me some guidance on that as well?
