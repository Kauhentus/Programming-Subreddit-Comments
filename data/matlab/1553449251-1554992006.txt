Don't forget the hold on command ;) 
That isn't needed if you only plot once?
You plotted it already my dude 
You are correct. I thought you wanted to make the line out of multiple plots. My bad! 
I don't want to be rude and I know it's a bit hypocritical coming from me, but for such simple question I think you should search engine \ read the matlab doc you will not go far if you ask help all the time.
In the past, I have either written my own Voronoi function or used another tool called [Neper](http://neper.sourceforge.net/) for generating grain structures. Writing your own Voronoi function is not all that challenging. You could start with a grid structure (a matrix) of all zeros, then initialize a bunch of grain centers, then find the grain center that each point in the grid is closest to. Neper is really cool too, and it's fast! 
Ah, ye olde tent map
function [num] = per(n, varargin) if nargin == 1 num = 0; else num = varargin{1}; end s = num2str(n); if (length(s) == 1) disp(['Persistence: ' num2str(num)]); return; end num = num + 1; res = 1; for i = 1:length(s) res = res * str2double(s(i)); end num = per(res, num); end
how? &amp;#x200B;
Ahh got it, works like a charm. Thanks so much!
It really depends on the nature of the nonlinearity in the system. In some cases you will have outputs that might be similar and in other cases not at all. 
Do linear regression in JMP
You can use plot3 or scatter to get 3d plots. Not exactly sure what you’re looking for
 for i = 1:length(ClReq) if ClReq(i)&gt;5.24 || ClReq(i)&lt;0.7 ClReq(i) = []; end end
 for i = 1:length(ClReq) if ClReq(i)&gt;5.24 || ClReq(i)&lt;0.7 ClReq(i) = []; i = i + 1; end end
 ClReq(ClReq &gt; 5.24) = []; ClReq(ClReq &lt; 0.7) = [];
 ClReq(ClReq &gt; 5.24 | ClReq &lt; 0.7) = []; but the or operator is || or | depending on context (logical vs short-circuit).
Can you explain your data more?
 indices = ClReq &gt; 5.24 | ClReq &lt; 0.7; newClReq = ClReq(~indices); % ~ is logical not delClReq = ClReq(indices); for i = find(delClReq) PowerReq.pop(i); % etc. end print(newClReq) | for vectors (arrays), || for scalars
Sure. So i have 3 variables that I have labeled as **A**, **B**, &amp; **C**. Each of these feed variable **D** experimentally. &amp;#x200B; To be specific, this data is obtained from a wind-tunnel experiment where **A**, **B**, &amp; **C** all pertain to an airfoil (sweep angle, lift coefficient, &amp; thickness-to-chord ratio). Each of these affect **D** which is a Mach number that is dependent on the design and operation of the airfoil. &amp;#x200B; The data is presented kind of weird but the figure above pertains to a *single* index of **A** (I have multiple sets similar to this one - one for each **A** index). Within this table, given **B** &amp; **C** values, **D** is the result. &amp;#x200B; Plotting these in 2-D, I do the following: `B = [0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6];` `C = [0.08 0.10 0.12];` &amp;#x200B; `D_B1 = [0.806 0.784 0.762]; %First row of D` `D_C1 = [0.806 0.785 0.763 0.742 0.720]; %First column of D` `%etc` &amp;#x200B; `figure` `hold on` `plot(B,D_C1);` `plot(B,D_C2);` `plot(B,D_C3);` `hold off` &amp;#x200B; `figure` `hold on` `plot(C,D_B1);` `plot(C,D_B2);` `plot(C,D_B3);` `plot(C,D_B4);` `plot(C,D_B5);` `hold off` &amp;#x200B; I would like to plot this in 3-D instead.
Have you tried using "cftool" in MATLAB?
I think plot3 might be what I'm looking for. I basically want to plot the above data as (x,y,z)=(B,C,D). It seems like plot3 wont work unless each vector is the same length though. &amp;#x200B; I'm going to keep messing around with this, thank you.
As for your second question, I'd imagine it something closer to this: for ~your range~ if (t &lt;= 10) s = 5*t*t; elseif (t( &gt; 10) s = (-1*t*t + (120*t) - 600; end end
Have you tried using "cftool"? it is a curve fitting tool, but it lets you plot 3D, for example: linear regression. https://i.imgur.com/44Mc90Z.jpg
Oh, I got you now. You are going to want to use mesh(x,y,z) or surf(x,y,z). Surf will give you a solid color surface, while mesh will......give you a mesh. &amp;#x200B; So with your function (the airfoil) has inputs *A*,*B*, and *C* with an output D. *A* is constant so don't worry about it. *B* and *C* vary producing *D*. *D* = f(a,b,c) &amp;#x200B; Think about it as a coordinate system at each point (*C*, *B*) in 2D get "height" result *D*. In 3D this point is just (*C*, *B*, *D*) or (C, B, f(a,b,c)). &amp;#x200B; For the mesh and surf function your inputs are a vector of *X* of length *n*, *C* in your case \[0.08 0.1 0.12\], a vector of *Y* of length m, *B* in your case *B* = \[0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6\], and a matrix *Z* of size m by n (m rows and n columns), *D* in your case. D = \[0.806,0.784,0.762;... 0.785 ,0.764,0.744;... 0.763 ,0.744,0.727;... 0.742 ,0.724,0.708;... 0.72 ,0.703,0.692\]; &amp;#x200B; If it doesn't plot in 3D use view(az,el). For your plot az = 115 and el=30 should be good. Hope this helps. :)
Inspired by Numberphile?
In this context you always want `|`. You use `||` for scalars. 
In Matlab, i = j = sqrt(-1), so it's a bad habit to use i or j as a loop index (or a variable at all, really). 
Wow this is *exactly* what I was looking for! &amp;#x200B; Thank you for the help :)
oops, it hasnt uploaed my image, will link &amp;#x200B;
Why not solve for the trajectory of the satellite using the ODE solver, and then use that trajectory to calculate your power generation afterwards? If the power generation numbers don't impact the ODE solution, then there's no reason to calculate them inside the ODE solver. It will just make it slower to solve the ODE. Why shoehorn an unnecessary calculation into a place where it doesn't make sense? It's just needless code complexity. 
Use the `plot` function. 
Any time you're typing `syms` you're using symbolic variables, not numbers. 
You loop over i and j, but only store the value indexed by i, so you're doing all those iterations over j and ignoring the output of all but the last. Why? Why even use a loop?
Read the documentation for fsolve. You don't need symbolic math and you don't need that loop over i. Also, in Matlab i = j = sqrt(-1), so it's a bad habit to use i or j as a loop index. 
It looks like you set `lambda` as an empty array. Later you calculate `stretch` as `lambda * l`. What do you think is the value of `stretch` at this point? Then you calculate the `lambda`-th value of `P` via that expression. Which element of the array `P` do you think contains the value resulting from that expression? Then you get an error that says "Vectors must be the same length". What do you think this might mean? It's quite a straightforward statement. Have you ever plotted something by hand? If I give a list of (x, y) pairs and ask you to plot them, you could do that, right? What if I gave you another list of values, but there were 10 x values and 7 y values. Would you be able to plot all 10 points? 
You need to solve the equation for lambda and then calculate lambda at both min and max P values. Then you get the min and max lambda values and you can plot the P function in between those. If you cannot solve the equation by hand then I suggest you just plot P with different lambda values and see what lambda has to be for it to be close to what your requirements are for P. Another way is to numerically solve the P, which matlab can do for you. See the vpasolve function or fzero, they might help you there. 
stretch is a quantity thats in my theory, but im not sure if i need it. for context, lamba = elongation/original length L0. im not sure if i need it in the program now you mention it, at least not for testing. lambda-th? i'm seeking to obtain lambda from each value of P, increasing stepwise between a range. vectors must be the same length; im guessing that means that the produced matrix has incompatible dimensions; im not sure why this would be the case though; i input varying values of P, do i not get an output value of lambda that corresponds to this? might i need to make lambda the subject, or does it not really matter? no, you wouldn't be able to do it without a pair for each one. im just confused as to why it isn't outputting what i want for each value of the P variable i want to use... 
so, rearrange for lambda and try it by hand/in excel?
Ok I'll try thanks
It would be crude, but should work, to do like this: 1. Initiate a global variable the length of your time span 2. Use t_out as an index, e.g. power_ext(ceil(t_out)) = power_int; 3. Filter out unassigned values. Will not give you perfect 1 second time resolution necessarily but it’s something. 
I try to plot with heaviside function but It doesn't look like in that pic exactly. Thanks you.
Yes first solve lambda(P) and then put your Pmin and Pmax values there to get some constraints for lambda. Then you take a bunch of points in between those lamda values and plot P(lambda_min) to P(lambda_max). You don't need excel really. 
Sorry I just dont know what function is it. I try heaviside function but It doesnt work. Thanks
That’s true about the vecs needing to be the same size. If they aren’t, then it means that you aren’t fully defining some of the points. In that case, how would you expect the plot to look for the points that don’t have 3 dimensions?
&gt;lambda-th? i'm seeking to obtain lambda from each value of P, increasing stepwise between a range. On the left hand side of the expression on line 18, you write `P(lambda)`. This is a reference to the `lambda`-th element of the array `P`. I think you should read the portion of the documentation on the topic of indexing. &gt; i input varying values of P, do i not get an output value of lambda that corresponds to this? You initially set P to an array containing a range of values, but you never use them, as the right hand side of the expression on line 18 does not involve P at all! &gt;might i need to make lambda the subject, or does it not really matter? I'm not sure what it means to be the "subject", but if you want to calculate something as a function of another, you will need an equation that is a function of that variable. Your expression on line 18 is a function of `lambda` but not `P`. And since `lambda` is an empty array, what do you think is the result of that expression? What did that expression yield when you tried running it in the console? What happens if you try evaluating a simple expression in the console, like `lambda*5`?
Sorry, you're right. I thought I had tried that and got 1. This seems like strange behaviour to me though as integer division in any other language normally results in truncation of the result. Just makes it difficult if I want to port Matlab code to C++. Oh well.
" On the left hand side of the expression on line 18, you write P(lambda) . This is a reference to the lambda \-th element of the array P . " Do i need to use lambda (P) instead then? " I'm not sure what it means to be the "subject", but if you want to calculate something as a function of another, you will need an equation that is a function of that variable " i input the equation as i found it in theory, with P = all other constants and lambda as arranged in the picture. so i would say P is the subject. When i tried running it in the console i got lots of zeros, and one value of 14.5.... which doesnt make sense in the context of my work.
 %if the value of i is even if mod(i,2) ~=0 This is telling you if i is odd.
Typo, sorry
Here's a quick and dirty solution: clc;clear all; A=1:10; B=11:20; C = [A;B]; D = []; %loops length of A for i = 1:size(C,2) for j = 1:size(C,1) D = [D C(j,i)]; end end disp(D);
In the code you wrote you only look at the value from either A or B but not both. If it takes a value from A it discards the value from B etc. What you want to do is to assign both the value from A and from B in every for-loop iteration. &amp;#x200B; Example using a counter (could be done more neatly for sure but it's a solution): %script interleaves A and B vector elements A=1:10; B=11:20; %preallocates vector [C] C=zeros(1,2*length(A)); counter = 1; %loops length of A for i = 1:length(A) C(counter) = A(i); C(counter+1) = B(i); counter = counter+2; end disp(C); &amp;#x200B;
You can avoid for-loops completely by pre-allocating an array of zeros and then indexing every other element: &amp;#x200B; A=1:10; B=11:20; C = zeros(1,length(A)+length(B)); C(1:2:end) = A; C(2:2:end) = B; This outputs: &amp;#x200B; A = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 B = 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 C = 1 11 2 12 3 13 4 14 5 15 6 16 7 17 8 18 9 19 10 20 &amp;#x200B;
This helped, thank you sooo much. I was about to add another for loop and make this so much more complex than it needed to be.
Unfortunately we have to use for loops for the assignment. Thanks anyway.
Oh dang. Well, the other answers should help I hope.
You solution is much better tho.
Yes, that's right.
&gt; integral Numerically evaluate integral. Q = integral(FUN,A,B) approximates the integral of function FUN from A to B using global adaptive quadrature and default error tolerances. What's your "B" in what you've typed? a point, or a vector? also, I'd recommend you also look at trapz if you would prefer to do this discretely.
Thanks for the reply. My B would be a point.
I hope you have your answer from your comment =). Let me know if you need anything further.
i've tried it in excel because matlab has me stumped, unfortunately. excel gives me some results, but creates a decreasing curve, which theory (shouldnt) support.... need to sort MATLAB to verify or unverify my results
&gt;Do i need to use lambda (P) instead then? I don't know. That would refer to the P-th element of the `lambda` array. Is that what you want to do? &gt;i input the equation as i found it in theory, with P = all other constants and lambda as arranged in the picture. so i would say P is the subject. Okay, that's fine, but I'm still not sure what "subject" means in this context. If that's a common term in your field of study, that's fine, but it doesn't necessarily have meaning in the context of programming in general. There is no guarantee that the equations as presented in a theoretical context will be appropriate for use in a computational context. It is your responsibility to make appropriate derivations or reformulations. In analytical math, it's entirely reasonable to define an equation with an expression on both the left and the right hand sides of the equals sign. In that context, the equals sign indicates equality, and it is assumed that the equation can be solved for various terms as necessary. In programming, = indicates *assignment* of the value of the expression on the rhs to the variable on the lhs. This is an instruction which the computer will follow, with no regard for what was meant, only for what was written. &gt;When i tried running it in the console i got lots of zeros, and one value of 14.5.... which doesnt make sense in the context of my work. Then you probably need to figure out where your code differs from your intent. I'd suggest reading a little bit about the language basics in the documentation. You should focus on the topics of indexing and assignment. If your expressions can't be explicitly solved for the variable of interest, you may also need to look into functions for numerical equation solving/root finding - `fzero` and `fsolve`. 
is each value of the NN array supposed to be the sum of 10 coin flips where true = 1 and false = -1?
Yes. Basically I am trying to create a NN long array then take a histogram of it. On average each should be zero, with a few above and below. Once it works I will take it out to 1000 flips and at least 10000 counts. Once I get this part worked out I then need to convert it to a probability density function (figured I could shortcut that process by using the histogram counts command to count each integer and divide by NN) and compare it to a "true" normal distribution PDF.
In the code above you would need to reset the 'Cointotal' variable at each new iteration of the NN for loop. However, a simpler approach would to omit the nested for loop altogether, for example: `nTrials = 1000000; %Number of elements in array` `nFlips = 10; %Number of tosses in group.` `probability = 0.5; %Set coin flip probability` `coinArray = NaN(nTrials,1);` &amp;#x200B; `for ii = 1:nTrials` `tenFlips = rand(10,1) &gt; probability;` `tenFlips = double(tenFlips);` `tenFlips(tenFlips == 0) = -1;` `coinArray(ii) = sum(tenFlips);` `end` &amp;#x200B; `fh = figure('name','Histogram of Coin Flip');` `histogram(coinArray,21);` `xlabel('Outcome'), ylabel('Number');` `title(``fh.Name``);`
I know that in what I've typed B is vector. But it's not a vector actually, it's row of values with each value needs to evaluated separately. So, this means the first integral is from 1 to 1, the second from 1 to 2, and so on until 1 to 10. In this way the results should be in a vector as well.
Do note that when you write equations in matlab you don't actually write "y(x)". Normally this would mean "function y where x is the variable" but in matlab you do not do this. In matlab you write something like x=1:10; % x is a vector with values 1, 2, 3, ... 10. z=11:20; % Another vector a = 7; % Just a constant y = a.*z./(x.^2); % equation would be y(x,z)=a*z/(x^2) plot(x,y); % Plot it with x being in the x-axis and y on y-axis Notice here for instance the ".\*" and "./" which means *element wise* multiplication and division. If you don't use the "." in front then it will be matrix multiplication / division.
Hm. Moved the reset line and ended up with an array of all 10's. However you show a way I would never have considered. I will have to play around with summing matrices. Is there an advantage to writing variables as a not-a-number upon creation versus zeros? I assume it is better because any particular cell may not get written to at all, yet zero is still exists as a (probably incorrect) value?
I understand now. For this, I'd suggest a for-loop, such as: x = [1:10]'; g = zeros(size(x)); fun=@(x) x.^2+x+5; for i = 1:length(x) g(i,1) = integral(fun,x(1),x(i,1)); end I'm not sure integral can do what you're asking directly. I'd also suggest cumtrapz for the same purpose, but it will only be accurate for a more continuous definition of x.
That's why I do it - sometimes you write 0 values to the array, so difficult to tell whether there was an error, or it wrote a value of 0. Initializing with NaNs will also cause functions like mean() or sum() to produce an error if not all the NaN values are overwritten.
I will have to remember this. I always just wrote zeros (probably left over from C++ class), but that is sloppy. Thanks.
Oh also in your code the rand(0,1) line is creating an empty array which causes an error. You'll need to change it to rand(1).
Well I'm essentially trying to plot an m by n matrix in 3-D and it looks like plot3 would require a square matrix. But I was able to figure it out using mesh.
&gt;I know that in what I've typed B is vector. But it's not a vector actually It is, actually. Matlab doesn't know what you mean, only what you write. 
I have a trimesh that I want to convert to a multi variable formula. How would I accomplish this?
Good question, i utilize euler angles calculated from quaternians to calculate the incidence angle of the sun. If i run the the program with a stop the angles being used inside the ode that gives me what appear to be nice results differ from what is finally exported from the solver. The result is essentially noise. 
Then you have a different problem to solve. That should be something you can calculate outside of the DE. if you're having trouble with that, you might be doing the calculations wrong. 
In your Arduino code you should write serial port lines with the sensor's data. Then create a serial object in matlab. s = serial('port','BaudRate',9600); Change 9600 for the baudrate your Arduino uses. Then you can retrieve the data using the command: data = fgetl(s); Then you can convert the data variable to a number if you want to.
And make sure you have [arduino support](https://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/arduino-matlab.html) installed
take a look at the Serial Port communication Toolbox for Scilab: https://gist.github.com/Foadsf/44fe9b5e2bcb02b22392adf6d8f7a871 There I have also provided one example code. you can see demos [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/b35xpk/live_plotting_of_sensor_data_using_scilab_serial/) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54960839/4999991)
R is awesome in all, but if the only reason you want to turn this into R is because you don't have a MATLAB license, then try Octave which is pretty much compliant with MATLAB syntax. If you want MATLAB GUI experiences and SIMULINK, then try Scilab / ScicosLab, which also have the xcos / scicos environment for visual programming. There is also FreeMat, but is not supported much anymore.

Fantastic 
Mmmmmm
You get an upvote for effort
makes no sense, how could a dog be a matrix laboratory
I actually need this crap today! thanx! (ಥ ͜ʖಥ)
That is correct. The primary purpose of Matlab is matrix and linear algebra. With the right programming you and have codes that solve entire problems based on a vector of inputs all at once without iterations which saves on a lot of computing time.
My dog gets stuck in a for loop all the time, sometimes don't function like I want it to, and every so often, leaves a nice little display of total bright coloured crap that I submit to my professor knowing full well it was either a) not the best I could do, and got lazy, or b) was the best I could do because my programming skills suck
That’s a piecewise function. You need some IF conditions and split it in 4 pieces. Heaviside is vertical
To answer this question, first type doc fzero Then you will see that fzero is used to estimate the root of a function given a first estimate. 
Line 4 defines an [anonymous function](https://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/anonymous-functions.html) and uses it as an input to the fzero() function. It could be broken down like this: myFunction = @(a) z1/k1+a) + z2/(k2+a) + z3/(k3+a); % Defien a function "myFunction" that takes one input "a" a = fzero(myFunction, 0.5); % try to find a point a where myFunction(a) = 0, start exploring at 0.5.
The @ is used to define an anonymous function. You should read the documentation on that topic. 
Which values? Are you trying to replace all 1.8e6 elements with new values? Or only the 110 elements specified by `X(:, a, b)` where `X` is your 110x128x128 array, and a and b are scalars? If you replace everything along one whole dimension of an array, you're replaced the whole array. In other words, `X(1:110, :, :)` references every element in the array. 
We're there homework assignments? You could ask your professor for practice problems. Or just think of an actual problem you'd like to solve with Matlab and work on it. 
You really need to read the documentation on indexing. I keep saying it and you ask questions that make it clear you haven't done it. It's not a minor part of my answer, it's the core of what you need. Then read about anonymous functions and fzero. 
Well how does it look? I wouldn't necessarily expect heaviside to look like this. 
Read this: https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/arduino-programming-matlab-simulink.html Matlab supports code generation for arduinos, so you should be able to define reading the sensor from the library and call your code, and then generate c code that can be deployed to your arduino
Go to offical website bro u can find directly
Cheers I just found it hidden away in there 
I’ve written a matlab code to query for encoder values on an arduino previously, I think it could be used for your purposes too. You basically want to ask the arduino for a given value and have it return the value to matlab, right? 
Pretty much, yes. The arduino compiles the data onto the serial monitor with a step time of 0.2s, so I basically would like to take the value which it is detecting at any given moment. The project is for a lift, where the tof sensor detects the location of the lift and compares it to the known height of the floor it wishes to be at. It will use the value to level the lifts cart with the floor it is going to. &amp;#x200B;
Okay I have done this and it gives me a result but its not exactly what I am looking for. It returns me the value defined first in the arduino code, "Serial.println("Adafruit VL53L0X test");", is there anyway to continually read the values as I believe just after this it would read the distance. Or could I try removing this line from the arduino code so it reads the number only. Only issue with this is i would need to keep reading these values so i believe i need the part mentioned before anyway
How big is the script? Could you paste it here?
Unfortunately I can’t paste it for a couple of reasons, my job is government and the script in question is on a secure workstation and even if I could, the script is big and the functions while straight forward do require some context and understanding about the data involved. My job sucks in that have to go back and forth between a secure room with no access to the outside world and a computer in a different(albeit really close) building lol
So normally when these issues come up when upgrading versions of MATLAB it actually has nothing to do with the new version of MATLAB and instead is the path differences between your installs. Things to look for: 1.) do you have any custom functions that are named the same as MATLAB built in functions, and the custom ones are no lower on the path? 2.) Do you have 2 versions of the same function, and the wrong one is higher on the path? 3.) This one is sort of version related, but do you create a variable which has the same name as a *new* MATLAB function? MATLAB is pretty good at maintaining compatibility between versions. They introduce new functions, but are very slow to break old ones. Normally if they are going to break something, they'll have a warning print out if you're using a function in a way that will break in future builds, but don't actually break it for several years later. 
Do you know how to program in any language? Or is programming in general new to you? Just asking to know how to answer your question
Oh cool I think you might have the answer I am looking for. So how would I fix path issues? Like if something doesn’t work for me but it works for someone else, what do I do to ensure consistency between users? How do I fix it so that for myself it works?
If it works somewhere else, have them save a [pathdef](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/savepath.html) file and put it in your boot-up folder, which will then over-ride your default path with that one. 
Oh cool thank you so much!!! 
To answer your title question, the only functional similarity between [`figure`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/figure.html) and [`drawnow`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/drawnow.html) of which I am aware is that both of them will refresh the display of graphics objects. Their usage is typically quite different. You would call `figure` either to create a new figure, or to make an existing figure the current figure (e.g. `figure(n)`), whereas you would call `drawnow` in a time-intensive calculation (typically a loop) to force an update of the display or allow interaction (clicks, resizing, etc.). Both will force the UI thread to update, meaning that some processor time is given to updating the display of information on the screen. Could you post a toy example? I guarantee your code is not unique in terms of graphics; it's all been done before. We don't need any of your data to help you with the commands.
We had homework assignments and I already asked my professor for practice problems but he said he didn’t have any other than the in class examples and the textbook. I just downloaded a different textbook and am working on that but I’m not sure if it’s the best approach 
I am familiar with programming, did some basic projects with javascript. 
Ah, I actually looked at your file. This isn't MATLAB, this is a [maple](https://www.maplesoft.com/) program. 
Feed it a bunch of faces and see how many it gets right?
ahh yes, after i rearranged for lambda and added in the . and undefined P it worked for me! well, i got some output at least. i'd like to do it in the form P = f(lambda), but it still doesnt seem to accept it in this form when i have a known range of P values, and am seeking lambda values on that basis. 
Well I feel stupid now. I'm in the wrong place then :,)
System Engineering I kind of get, even if it seems weird. But Projects? Why do I want to do project management in Matlab? 
It came out a week ago son!
Continuous integration and team project file management, primarily. Basically extending the capabilities from Simulink Projects for MATLAB-only users. &amp;#x200B; What came to mind when you heard Projects? &amp;#x200B; **NOTE: I work in MathWorks Product Marketing.**
Understood. I figured I'd ask.
Oops. I received the announcement today, and and a search of the sub didn't show anyone else mentioning it.
Ok! I was thinking more of GANT charts etc. Support for CI sounds nice! 
That makes sense. We don't have any plans for Gantt charts, by the way (in case you were worried we all went insane). Product naming is a tricky art.
They are deprecating `csvread` in favor of `readmatrix`, don't really know why.
Not deprecating, actually. Just not recommending. (Semantics, amiright?) &amp;#x200B; Quick look at [the doc](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/csvread.html?s_tid=srchtitle#mw_7b1de7d8-a3a6-4153-b607-9441ae811666): &amp;#x200B; csvread is not recommended. Use [readmatrix](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/writematrix.html) instead. There are no plans to remove csvread Starting in R2019a, use the readmatrix function to read a matrix from a csv file. The readmatrix function has these advantages over the csvread function: * Better cross-platform support and performance * Automatic detection of data format and types * Ability to use import options to control the data import process, including the handling of errors and missing data

Are the memory leaks that have been plagueing Matlab since forever fixed?
What memory leaks? As someone who writes a metric ton of matlab code I should have noticed by now but no, matlab is the most stable environment I ever developed on. 
haha no problems my man!
i am pretty sure this is a bit simpler that that, but never done piv (though it sounds cool for fluid mechanics and such)
Hi. I just want to know where can i be beaten by a security guard in your country.
Related to file management: Are there plans to integrate simulink models, or rather libraries, to better work with version control, i.e. text based for diffs opposed to binary? Bypass via XML lacks the import functionality iirc.
Someone is board at work/school.
Check out java.util.Date
 c = clock returns a six-element date vector containing the current date and time in decimal form
A few useful functions when working with time/date in matlab are: [datenum](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/datenum.html), [datestr](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/datestr.html), and [datetime](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/datetime.html). [duration](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/duration.html)may also be useful for what you're doing.

I dont know too much about this, but I did just implement motion control which I initially tried to use matlab for. As far as i understood you needed a Matlab add on to do this (I forgot which one) which was fairly expensive. If you get hardware to connect with the drive then this usually comes with software to connect with the drive and will likely give you the motion control you need. I went with National instruments SMD 7616 drives which are capable of single axis straight line moves. They connect to the computer via ethernet and then to the stepper drives. They utilize LabView for motion control which wasn't too bad to figure out and I inserted my matlab code into the labview environment. I'm surprised you can't find any resources on this though. (You can also use an arduino with labview instead of the smd drive)
Ah, I only looked for "r2019a", not just "2019a". Sorry.
Are they integers or strings? Array indices have to integers. 
no worries! not like mine got much attention anyways!
They're all integers
Wait so are you trying to have matlab get every TOF data point eery 0.2 seconds, or just querying arduino whenever you want to know the TOF data? If its continuous data collection, then you could just keep checking the buffer in matlab. If its querying, then its slightly harder, but doable (this is what I had to figure out for me awhile ago). 
I'd print elementsXweight and make sure your indexing right.

So it's just an array and not a matrix?
It's in rows of 5 tho, isn't that a matrix?
So it's just a vector and not a matrix? You're indexing has 2 dimensions!
mathworks offers great material: [https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/getting-started-with-matlab.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/getting-started-with-matlab.html) [https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/?s\_tid=getstart\_mlacad](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/?s_tid=getstart_mlacad) &amp;#x200B;
It’s in rows of 5 tho. Is it not a matrix?
In the sense that matlab is an IDE, project is a good name
Hi there! Since you're a MWer, are you aware of any future plans to improve the overhead performance of object creation and/or copying in Matlab? I was a bit disappointed to read the release notes for this new version and not see much in the way of performance enhancements. 
Well I couldn’t replicate your problem. I will suggest using Excel and xlsread instead of text files but I guess that’s just personal preference. 
No dark mode?
Does that give solutions if you can’t solve it?
No, I didn't see any description of the dark mode.
I thought there already was one 
It does not.
You can manually change the color scheme to whatever you would like! 
Click on the point where the poles intersect each other (around -2.4656+0j, be sure to click on the real axis very very close to the point where the poles diverge) Then display k (about 0.4186) and poles (the best I got was [-2.4656 -2.4656 -0.0689]) You can zoom into the intersection point before executing the rlocfind function to give yourself a more accurate clicking point.
It is much simpler to just find someone who is willing to do your homework for cash without the covert ops. 
Why the downvotes? This is a serious issue. Sometimes, when for loops are a necessity to loop over data, the program grinds to a halt after a few hundred iterations (YMMV) due to poor memory management.
Why the downvotes? This is a serious issue. Sometimes, when for loops are a necessity to loop over data, the program grinds to a halt after a few hundred iterations (YMMV) due to poor memory management. Improvements to look out for.
I don't know what version you are on, my last one is 2018 and since the early beginning of , I dunno, 2014, I had to regularly close Matlab itself and restart the PC because it hogged Memory. 
If you want to use that form then you need to solve it numerically. You ought to check out fzero function. 
You can make do with https://ch.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/53862-matlab-schemer But it would be nice for native support like RStudio.
Are you planning on using guide or appdesigner?
If it queries it every 0.2 seconds this is fine but I only need it for a limited time. I will use a open loop system to estimate the destination of the car and then when it finishes this it was begin a closed loop part where the ToF data will be used. So It can query it every 0.2 or just when it wants. I guess if it takes a significant amount of computation to constantly do the former, then I would need to figure out how to do the latter. Would you be able to expand more on how I could check the buffer in matlab? (I'm new to matlab/arduino and control in general, trying to do this for an honers project (So im in deep shit basically))
a bit of skepticism is fine here and there, but logically speaking this would be way too much work if i was finding people to do my homework
I'm confused. Excel can solve the problem but Matlab requires 70+ GB memory? More description of what you want to accomplish with Matlab would be helpful. Are you just plotting? Are you doing linear algebra?
The data is just stored in an excel file and brought into Matlab to give me X,Y,Z components. However, I require to use the Thin-plate spline interpolate option in the curve fitting toolbox. When I try to run run this it says there is not enough memory (my computer has 22GB RAM and this requires 70+ GB RAM). As I am using the curve fitting toolbox, is there a way to use Datastore or any other methods to run this simulation? :)
I can't comment on details or timing, but this is a well known issue, especially as customers push further into CI. Thanks for the feedback.
Unfortunately that's not my domain (I'm on the Simulink Verification and Validation team), but I'd strongly recommend reaching out via MATLAB Answers. Only a handful of us are regularly checking reddit at the moment (that may change). If you have a specific issue, I recommend asking on MATLAB Answers or (better yet) contacting MathWorks Support. Keep them on their toes!
So you're saying something about the fitting algorithm requires a lot of memory, even though your data is much smaller? If that's the case, I'm not sure using a datastore will help, since it's the variables inside the fitting algorithm that are becoming too large. I'm not sure though. It's possible that the fitting code is smart enough to use datastores internally if you provide input as datastores, but I wouldn't expect this to be the case. That said, I don't think it's necessary or reasonable for a fitting routine to require many times the memory of input data, so maybe this is a bug that you could resolve with Mathworks tech support. Of course, I don't know a lot about that particular type of fitting, so maybe it does unavoidably require a lot of memory. 
I would definitely reach out to MathWorks Support if you're running into memory leaks. That is a serious concern.
Great suggestion. I'll pass it along to the MATLAB team. I heard this at a conference from multiple users, and it was a Simulink booth! &amp;#x200B; (Any takers for xkcd mode in Simulink, by the way?)
I agree with /u/FrickinLazerBeams . It seems like the spline fit probably wasn't designed for large data problems. There's probably a dense matrix in there somewhere. Maybe try visualizing the data without smoothing? Otherwise you'll need some other algorithm... Good luck!
&gt;i'd like to do it in the form P = f(lambda), but it still doesnt seem to accept it in this form when i have a known range of P values Because "P = f(lambda)" is an instruction that says "evaluate the function `f` for the input value contained in the variable named `lambda`, and assign the result to a variable named `P`, overwriting any previous value of `P` if it exists". That's what that instruction means and what it always means, regardless of what you *want* it to mean. Matlab isn't designed to be a magic machine that you can just type equations into directly from a theoretical work and have it spit out the answers you expect. It's a programming language, and it is your job as the programmer to translate your theory equations into *instructions* for carrying out the necessary calculations. The most efficient way to do this (solve `y = f(x)` for values of x given known values of y) is to explicitly solve your equation for the variable of interest, so you have `x = f'(y)` where I'm using ' to indicate the functional inverse. In situations where such an inverse cannot be derived analytically, you would use a numerical equation solver (numerical root finding algorithm) such as Newtons method, bisection, the secant method, etc. This is provided in Matlab by the `fzero` and `fsolve` functions.
Thanks, I'll do that! Any suggestions for how to word my request?
Thanks! We'll get there eventually haha
Ye this makes sense, thank you!
This is more of a geometry question than a Matlab question. The euclidean distance between two position vectors, r1 and r2, can be expressed as the two norm of the difference of the two vectors. In Matlab, norm(r1-r2,2)
Just write in the formula with full stops before mathematical operators? Assuming the values you're using are in the same place in the matrix 
So enter in my variables like normal but with full stops before operators and I will get a matrix output with the result of the formula for each value in the respective location in the matrix? Very convoluted question sorry I’m woeful when it comes to explaining things like this 
Question: I don't work for MATLAB or anything, but could you post some sample code that demonstrates this behavior?
Its an exam dude.... Study or fail
Fail is whats going to happen. Unless... 
Say you have the matrices a,b and c which are all the same size Y = (a.*b)./c That would carry out the formula for each row (or column) of the matrix. It might not be what you're after, seems far too basic but it's what I understand from the question 
No you're right this is absolutely what I'm looking for thank you! Now just to figure out a way to apply it to find euclidean distance lol thanks again!
Hope you don't mind me asking but did you actually try tackle one of those projecst? :)
No idea what you want any of us to do in the next 1.5 hours.
transfer your knowledge to me after i take pics of the problem
I only know how to code in Matlab 2019, sorry
hahaha 
I understand the theory behind euclidean distance well, it's implementing the theory to matlab that's the problem. My x and y values are constant, but the z can take up a range of values so what i am struggling with is writing a formula to get a string of euclidean distance for my range of z.
I'm not super fluent in the lingo, but I beleive I am making it in guide.
Square root of sum of the squares. Same as 2-D. 
This isn't so different from your last question, and I would still recommend using `fminsearch` for this function. Were you able to use it last time? Did you have a specific question about how to use it?
 So this is what i have currently: a = ones(1,36)\* 2000; b = ones(1,36)\*70; Rc = 0:35; Tc = ones(1,36)\*40; c = Tc - Rc; D = a.\^2 + b.\^2 +c.\^2; d = sqrt.(D); &amp;#x200B; I'm trying to get a string of values for a b and c then add each respective element of the 3 matrices together then sqrt each value within the final matix. However, when i enter d i get a string of 1.6 when i should be getting a string of all different values? &amp;#x200B;
Apologies thought i formatted the code by putting 4 spaces before each line!
Hey ! :) Yeah I tried, but it is quite more difficult... Because, there is new problem to my initial one : I shoul fit the whole data at once to be sure that it does fit everything well (the transition region is very important for my work). But the problem is that the y\_left is not defined at x&gt;x0, and vise-versa for y\_right. 
In the normal interpretation of 3-space, you have something like the distance between two floors via elevator, no? So it's just the difference between the z values? In a typical right-handed position vector, you have `[x, y, z]`, so you could just use the third element of each for the difference. Have you learned how to use [indexing](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/array-indexing.html) to extract specific elements? In terms of making a string out of it, you could either use the [`num2str`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/num2str.html) command, or the [`sprintf`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/sprintf.html?searchHighlight=sprintf&amp;s_tid=doc_srchtitle) command (or [`fprintf`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fprintf.html) if you'd like to display the result directly).
That actually doesn't hurt you. You can do it all in one go with `fminsearch`. Make your function you're minimizing something like: function error = sample_fit_function(A, parameters) x0 = parameters(1); n = parameters(2); p = parameters(3); x1 = A(A(:,1) &lt;= x0,1); x2 = A(A(:,1) &gt; x0,1); y1 = 1 + (x0 - x1).^n; y2 = 1 + (x2 - x0).^p; error1 = sum((y1 - A(A(:,1) &lt;= x0, 2).^2); error2 = sum((y2 - A(A(:,1) &gt; x0, 2).^2); error = error1 + error2; (I'm not sure all of that is right, didn't test it in MATLAB, but something like that) 
I'm gonna start pretty vague, but if you try to implement something and you're still confused, let me know and I'll give some more detail. &gt; I do not know how to make it so that each player can take a turn Start a counter at 1 or 0 or whatever you want, whenever the user clicks a spot, increment it. For this example, let's say you start at 1. 1 corresponds to X, since X goes first in tic tac toe. That means that when the user clicks, counter will increment and now be 2. If counter is even, set the pushbutton text to 'o', otherwise, set the pushbutton text to 'x'. As for how to make it place a 1 in the matrix, if you have a 3x3 matrix set up and the 9 pushbuttons in the 3x3 configuration, then if the user clicks the top left (1,1) pushbutton, then the callback should be to make (1,1) = 1. If they press the middle PB, the callback would set (2,2) = 1. But you also need to be careful to add it ot the right matrix. Remember the counter though. If the counter vlaue is odd, replace the value in the x players matrix, and place it in the o players matrix if it is even.
The more specific you can be about any problems or concerns, the better. That being said, with the Support team, you're more likely to have success even if you are looking for advice. If it's just a general concern, it is harder for the Support and Development teams to help. One thing to keep in mind is that we don't share roadmap details, but we try to help and learn from current customers as often as possible. Going through Support is a good way of getting in contact with the right people.
Do you just want to alter the path string for each loop? sprintf('...\\sof10test%.0f.csv', yourCounter) should deliver that string.. If you also want to use different variables for each round, you may want to look into cell arrays and gather your data within one variable instead. 
Ahh I see, so there's no quick fix for doing a counter for the variables too without delving into the world of cell arrays?
I guess, since you already work with strings, you could also use different fields of a struct.. `accData= struct();` `accData.( 'sof101') = AccData;` Where .(string) would create a new field or adress an already existing field using a string.
Thanks gonna try it ones my computers running again
I shall have a look into that. Thanks!
Are you asking what is a complex pole physically? I guess I don't really understand your question. A complex pole is a pole that lies in the complex plane.
I think I did something similar, but it does not work (I had no curses on usining fitting tools)... &amp;#x200B; I created a function FullCurve : function output = FullCurve(coefs,x) Ti = 25e-3; sig = @(x)(1./(1+exp(-x))); Ii = zeros(size(x)); Ie = zeros(size(x)); Ii(x&lt;=coefs(3)) = (coefs(1)+coefs(2).*(coefs(3)-x(x&lt;=coefs(3))).^coefs(4))... .*sig((coefs(3)-x(x&lt;=coefs(3)))/Ti); Ie(x&gt;=coefs(3)) = (coefs(5)+coefs(6).*(x(x&gt;=coefs(3))-coefs(3)))... .*sig((x(x&gt;=coefs(3))-coefs(3))./coefs(7)); output = Ie + Ii; end And I the script I run : Chi2 = @(coefs) sum(FullCurve(coefs,xdat)-ydat); k0 = [-1e-5,... a1 Ii -1e-5,... a2 Ii 20,... Vp 0.75,... pow Ii 1e-5,... a5 Ie 1e-5,... a6 3]; % Te Final = fminsearch(Chi2,k0(:)) This gives me a FullCurve(Final,xdat) = Inf everywhere...
A complex pole has an imaginary component, they come in pairs (+/- j ) and represent the denominator of the transfer function that defines your system. 
Unless I'm missing something, you're returning just the sum of your outputs- not the sum of the errors of your outputs (unless I'm missing something). If you're fitting data, you have to hand in your measurements and then compute the error of the estimate to the measurement data. 
I'm an absolute novice with root loci. I've been ready for throwing this computer out for the past week ha. Ive plotted a root locus and the question states to apply the 9 rules to my locus. Ive done the other 8 except the rule above. Im unsure if my plot follows this rule and therefore wanted to see if i had a complex poles
Well I can't tell you if your tf has complex poles. Go on matlab, put your tf in (sys = tf([coefficients]), then do poles(sys) and see if there are any complex poles.
That tells me that theres an error so im assuming there are no complex poles. Below is my code anywho. Num = [1] Den = [16 80 140 100 24] sys=tf(Num,Den) rlocus(sys) x = [-64 -240 -280 -100] roots(x) grid
&gt;missing something, you're returning just the sum of your outputs- not the sum of the errors of your outputs (unless I'm missing something). If yo Hum, oh yes... I forgot a .\^2 in the definition of Chi2. But the output is not acceptable. The fitted curve is really far away from the experimental data ! &amp;#x200B;
Well don't make that assumption, it's just nonsensical lol. So your transfer function is: 1/(16s^4 + 80s^3 + 140s^2 + 100s +24) If you don't have symbolic toolbox poles wont work. But poles are the same thing as the zeros of the denominator. So you can do roots(Den) and see that the poles are at -2, -1.5, -1, and -0.5. So there are no complex poles for this system. 
I think the problem is to complicated to be solved in one time. I gonna make it by parts, hoping this would help. But thanks for your help. I will use this function to fit my curves. :)
Ok thank you very much! 
i'd say that you can, but i wouldn't do it in matlab if i had a choice
The sprintf answer from u/uNeijan is the correct way to do it. If you just want to process a folder full of cvs files, though, all you have to do is this: `files = dir('*.csv')` `for i = 1:length(files)` `data = csvread(files(i).name);` `...The rest of your processing` `end`
I see. You're right, that's an important clarification. Thanks for the information! I haven't installed 2019a yet, but I'll have to give the method a try to see if I can benefit from the improvements.
Its for a school project and the teacher said the we have to use MATLAB
the project is a "pick what you want to do" project? i'd honestly choose something different unless you know matlab really well and you're really sold on this project.
Downvotes because all of this claim of "memory mismanagement" has been extremely vague with no supporting evidence of some behavior that couldn't alternatively be explained by poor coding practices or simply running projects that require as many resources as the person's machine has.
My other option is a program that can count how many people are there in a crowd surveillance footage and a program that can translate sign languaje to text/ speech (input via an xbox one kinect)
You can zoom in for a more clear image. I'm basically running a simulation for a car and want to control the speed, set to 30mph. Whenever I try to run the system with the PID controller I get that error. I have an integration block in the car subsystem that's converting force applied to the car into speed. I guess this is where the issue is coming from, but how do I fix this? 
My other option is a program that can count how many people are there in a crowd surveillance footage and a program that can translate sign languaje to text/ speech (input via an xbox one kinect)
Crowd surveillance sounds easiest to me. Is it actual video or can you just take a single frame? What kind of class is this for? This seems a lot more comp-sci than MATLAB, to be honest. It actually sounds pretty fun, just not in the typical realm of MATLAB application (which is, in college, often used in an engineering context.)
I thinks its actual video, but yeah its called advance programming but the teacher just told us to think of any project and ask him if its okay to make it, just to see if its like either too easy or too hard 
What level of education is this? Depending on that, these could be reasonable, or totally unreasonable ideas. To do either of them to any success is non-trivial and require at least the matlab image acquisition and image processing toolboxes. 
Awesome thank you so much, I’ll try to do all this and see if I run into any other problems.
sign language doesnt sound viable, not only do you need to worry about the code itself... you also have to learn sign language. Languages have grammar and exceptions sometimes, which is difficult to teach a program. &amp;#x200B;
No problem, good luck. For what it's worth, there are other ways to do this. You don't have to replace the letters on the pushbutton, that's (imo) a kind of strange way to do it. I'd probably do it on a plot if I were you. Everything I posted will be the same, but you'll just open a figure and plot x's and o's to the figure on pushbutton press instead of changing the text.

I'm pretty sure that a Kinect doesn't have the resolution to discern individual fingers or different poses of individual fingers. The crowd thing might work if Matlab provides a facial recognition toolbox and your school provides access to it. I know when Matlab demos their ML toolbox, they show gathering data from the New York state power authority and graphing it. You can even get this data in real time. But then they use it to estimate demand based on time of day and the previous few weeks of behavior. If they could take any old picture and pick out the faces, I would think they would show that, but maybe not.
 Well, a pid is typically designed to be tuned by hand... You will loose more time to connect all the simulink stuff than tuning the pid by hand. Pid have only 4 parameter (kp, ki, kd plus time constant of the derivative filter). It seems strange to me to optimize mathematically a controller that may not be suited to your system (i.e. A pid is a second order controller with a specific structure, there is no à priori reason that it could be the best control structure for a particular system). If you are looking for performances, then do a basic model and do use a more serious control approach (pole placement using RST controller for instance). 
#1 is easily doable in a few lines of code. #2 is a PhD thesis.
I already have my model implemented in Simulink and I am able to tune it manually. I just want to know if I can use the Matlab Tuner app in Simulink External mode ( running on Arduino hardware).
Hi I ended up getting more Matlab tasks at work. It is good to get paid 👍

Something like this? https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ref/vision.peopledetector-system-object.html#mw_6c03411a-3516-4f90-a051-e6128dbe36fb
What is your application?
Definitely go with people counter. Look up peopleDetector in MATLAB documentation. Try to get the example to work for a video instead of an image. Be sure to post your work to Github.
Yes, it is possible. Here is an illustration in the documentation: https://www.mathworks.com/help/slcontrol/ug/tune-pid-controller-in-real-time-using-open-loop-pid-autotuner-block.html Out of curiosity, how do you plan to use a PID controller for temperature? Do you have an actuators capable of producing heat and cold (negative heat)? Typically the output of a PID controller can be both positive and negative. (or maybe you want to control a temperature to a set point high enough? I don't know. What's the exact application, if you don't mind?)
Well, actually, you could use strings instead of char array and do: for idx = 1:42 var = cvsread("C:\some_path\sof10test" + idx + ".csv"); % do your computation to get time and acc plot(time, acc) title("Acceleration for file " + idx) end I would probably take the approch to use the "dir" method from /u/neuro_exo personnaly, but it depends on what you need exactly. (I may also use table instead of matrix, so readtable instead of csvread, but that's definitevely a matter of preference)
Well im just learning matlab rn. I just wanted to know of a cheat sheet for beginners. 
Im just leaning matlab rn and i wanted a cheat sheet of the most important things in matlab as a beginner.

So now the question is: Does OP have access the necessary toolboxes? If yes, this should be fairly easy. If no, it's probably beyond an undergrad project.
Even if you don't do a school project about Melee, you may be interested in learning more about Project Slippi: https://medium.com/project-slippi/project-public-release-4080c81d7205 It's a really cool effort to create easy-to-parse Melee game data. It may be interesting to do some sort of analysis on a set of games (maybe building some sort of statistical model).
Are these topics you're interested in, or are they just things you think you can do in MATLAB that would fair well under the scrutiny of your professor? Honestly I think the best way to find a good MATLAB project for you to really dig into is to try to identify the technical aspects of any your main hobbies and come up with a way to simulate something, or interface with something and present some interesting data, etc. As long as the software is well-designed and shows you know how to implement the concepts you've been learning about in the class I'd guess there wouldn't necessarily be a "better" project topic to pick. &amp;#x200B; No malice intended at all - the projects sound good, I just figured it'd be worth mentioning. To answer your question, if I had to pick one I'd personally go with the surveillance footage one because the sign language interpretation project seems like it'd take more than a semester of individual work to get it right.
Google it, I found tons of them when I was just starting out. Pick on that's fairly condense, a page or two, print it, and keep on slogging.
Do you still have the documents?? It will make it easier. 
Do you have Google? It will make your life (not just the Matlab part) easier.

Press F1. 
Your metrics are good. Your results are common to machine learning and data science. It is hard to say if you should change anything until you perform [cross validation](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~schneide/tut5/node42.html) using all the data on hand. Running only one test doesn't quite paint the full picture of if your methods work or not. Your initial test data might work with 3, but if you used a different set of data it may need to be different.
The best cheat sheet is the included documentation.
No idea. What are you doing and what are you expecting? Need a better explanation because we can't read your mind
Matlab documentation comes with Matlab. Just press F1. 
What are you asking?
Numerical instability maybe? Evaluate your ODE for a point in the region that's having trouble and see if it's output agrees with known values. Then you can run it line by line and see where it starts going wrong. 
Even 1 is PhD thesis level, without some kind of restrictions on the problem space. Just off the top of my head: * Is this a view from above, over a region small enough that the view angle is approximately the same across the field of view? * Are the people densely packed - meaning, can you assume each one is visually non-contiguous with any other person, and is surrounded by some non-zero amount of the background? * Is the background and lighting fixed and known (e.g. Is it ever possible to image the room in a known-empty state? Are there windows to the outdoors?) * Does this need to function in real time? With any degree of video quality? * Color video? * Does this need to be robust against adversarial input (i.e. People who are aware of the counting system and actively trying to avoid it). In fact, to make this work reliably in real world scenarios, I think you'd need more than just one PhD thesis worth of development. This is the result of a team of researchers working for a few years. 
Alot of your code is missing. Where's the code to generate the plot and where's the function call to ode45
If the book has examples of using ode45 why don't you try those examples first and see if they make sense and then ask questions about that problem if you don't understand what they do. 
Type these, 1 by 1, into MATLAB and read: help det help inv help rank 
Do you mean A = \[ 2,1,1; 4,1,0; -2,2,1\] ?
I think it'd be quite difficult to get the bar chart to allow individual manipulation of both axes. Check out the "rectangle" function. For example see the output you get for this code: \`rectangle('Position',\[0 0 9 2\],'FaceColor','b','EdgeColor','k')\`
Can you post your code?

Thank you for the response! I ran some more tests today, doing CV with the data I had. The images were paired 1&amp;2, 3&amp;4, 5&amp;6 and 7&amp;8, for each pair I trained on the other 6 images and then used predict on the other two. This meant I had 1232 tests for each row in the tables [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vMOB-q5C8rc_M2BnfaDUpZjuJbkCxHtV/view?usp=sharing). (Ignore the laziness/errors with rounding, this is only rough as i'm still making tweaks). I know that 1232 in the grand scheme of things isn't much, but I can't do too much more with the little amount of data I have, unless I mix up the pairs (ie 8 choose 2 pairs) The results I have there are good enough for my project report. I guess my question now is do I need to do a set of tests which include people that haven't been in the training phase? (Essentially classes that haven't been seen before by the classifier). It doesn't feel right using the predict method as the probability from that is just split between it's neighbours. Do I need to use a different metric? Hopefully I'm making sense in what I'm trying to ask. In a lot of the papers in my research they don't mention doing tests with images that aren't enrolled in the database, so maybe it isn't necessary?
Many classification protocols are unable to to address data that was not present in their training or enrollment datasets. KNN is one such example of this because it attempts to label each test sample based upon what it learned during training. If it did not learn the class during training, it will naturally attempt to put the previously unseen subject into one of the existing classes. This will negatively impact sensitivity, but there are reasons one might want to do this sort of testing. There isn't much more you can do unless you wish to evaluate the similarity of these unknown subjects to the known subjects via the distance between them. Right now you make a judgement call based upon the similarity of the test to the known and label it. As such you can never produce answers if you don't have labels. If you wish to be able separate an unknown number of subjects that may not have been in the training data then you would need to switch to evaluating the distance between the test and each training model. Thus your metric would be distance between known subjects. This would at least allow you to identify subjects that were not seen in training and attempt to cluster them based on distances and not labels.
try using the time profiler in the run and time button just right of the play button on the editor tab. It'll tell you what's taking so long. It looks like you're already treating x and y in their full vector forms so there's not a ton of room there. Could just be the overhead on the high power exponents
Thank you again! So I know matlab has functions such as pdist2 to help calculate the distance. How do the tests work now in terms of 'enrolment'. i.e. would I use 1 image of each person as reference, then compare the distance between the feature vectors of the reference and the other images? Or would I give it multiple images to enrol with?
KNN already does a bit of this by allowing you to use different distance metrics, often called kernels, to resolve the 3/5/7/etc nearest neighbors it finds to build its model. KNN already has models of each subject because you've given it samples and labels. You would take the properties learned from the KNN you built and use those as your models (means, variances, and weights). Then for each test sample you evaluate the distance between a given test sample and all the models. The assumption is that test samples from identical subjects would produce similar distances to all the models you mapped. Thus you can evaluate the similarity of your test samples to each other while resolving which test samples map to known subjects. The distance tool you use to compare these models and the tests is up to you: mean square error, mahalanobis distance, cosine distance, GMM, on and on. However, if you wish to go this far it might be wise to consider other classifiers capable of leveraging the labeled data better than KNN.
I'm just kind of confused. You're just trying to plot (1/a) vs a? plot(a,1/a)?
Hi ! I woul do so : x = -10:0.1:10; a = input('What is a ?'); y = zero(size(x)); y(and(x&gt;=a,x&lt;=a))=1/a; &amp;#x200B; Let me know if it is good enought
My teacher told me that this is called continuous approximated Dirac and that is why i need to go with plot. That picture is resuld of that signal. &amp;#x200B;
&amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
It is good, but for some reason it put first X into -0.1 and not 0 . U have any idea why ?
Hum, maybe change the &lt;= and the &gt;= into &lt; and &gt;. I think this will do. 
You can make your function a function of more than your parameters for `lsqnonlin`. In your case, you'd call it something like this: fit_params = lsqnonlin(@(a) fun_x_polyn(a, x, y), a,[],[], options); and then make your `fun_x_polyn` a function of `a` `x` and `y`. 
Yes it solved it Thank you

Sorry I'm not fully understanding how to a) Extract/Use a model for a class from the KNN in this context. I can see that it has a mean and a standard deviation for each input image. b) How to test it against a sample image presented. I've been looking at the euclidean distance between the two feature vectors. Those which are of the same image, the distance is lower. I'm assuming I'm barking up the wrong/a different tree?
The class means (Mu) and variances (Sigma) [stored in the KNN](https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/classificationknn.html) should match the number of features for each sample. You would then pair the models means and variances against those of the features from your test samples. Any way of calculating a distance between two feature vectors should be sufficient. 
I think it's because you have vectors initialized improperly. You have initial conditions set to [0 1] but it should be [0;1] Furthermore your output is set as [v z] when it should be [v,z] Try that and get back to me. 
\[\~,ind\] = max(v)
Thank you so much! It works flawless now. Cheers
Thanks, tried that which gives 175 which I think is the index position of that maximum, but I can't get it to actually output the x value of that index position - do you know how?
All these different methods I'm trying give 175, which is clearly not the displacement (x) at which the maximum velocity (v) occurs so I'm stumped http://prntscr.com/n4aluq
Ah sorry to spam you, I've done it using this method: http://prntscr.com/n4apaf to find the index and then find the corresponding x value at that index position. Thanks for your help, I appreciate it!
I know this may be basic, but how would i set up the callback for the pushbutton. Also if I were to do what you suggested all I would have to do is place the pushbottons on a plot?
Uhh, no. You'd have two windows: your GUI, and a figure window. The GUI would have the 9 buttons. The figure window would have a plot of a tic-tac-toe board and on it, you'd need to plot X's and O's according to which pushbutton was pressed. As to setting up the callback, are you asking how to actually create a callback? Or what to put inside of your callback? For example, I'll just make a very simple GUI that will print something to the command line when the PB is pressed: - Open MATLAB. Type "guide". - Choose "Blank GUI", press Ok. - Drag the pushbutton (on the left column) onto your GUI. - Right click it, press "view callbacks", and press "callback". - Save your file. - your file should open in the MATLAB editor. - Find the function pushbutton1_callback - Inside of your function, type 'disp('this is a test') - Run your program. - Press the PB and you should see "this is a test' in the command line. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Is this what you're asking? Or do you know how to create the callback, and you're asking what should be inside the PB callback function?
I already have the gui setup with nine pushbuttons and I can see their callbacks in guide. I am asking what should be inside the PB callback function in order to make so that when they click the counter will increase and so that an X or O will appear inside of the pushbutton.
Check out something like [this](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/313999-help-with-tictactoe-code). All you're doing is replacing his input via command line (the input command) wiht your input through pushbuttons. 
So you have the index where the maximum occurs. That tells you which `x` the maximum occurs. For example, if `ind` was `1` then `x(1)` would be the `x` value where the max occurs
Their website has a ton of content and so does their youtube channel. 
Exactly what it says: your coe is trying to index an array (vector/matrix) using something that isn't an integer or a set of logical values. Try this: A = [1 2; 3 4]; A(3); % OK, we index A with an integer A(2,1); % OK, we index A with integers A([true true false false]); % OK, we index A with logical values A([3 4]); % NOT OK! We cannot index A with an array! But as always, place a breakpoint of the line on which your code crashes and check what's going on manually. 
Hello, Concerning the link you provided, I was asking about the PID Tuner app not the Simulink tuner block. As for your question, I have a DC 50W lamp for producing heat. I am using the PID output as duty cycle (I have restricted it between 0 and 255). I have no actuator producing cold, my goal is to maintain temperature at 37 degrees for an infant incubator. Since, there is a significant amount of heat dissipation I don't expect that I'll need to generate cold. I am also using the same technique to maintain humidity by controlling a water heater also with another PID.
I see students get this error most often when they're trying to call a function, but previously created (usually accidentally) a variable with the same name. So the line that looks like it's supposed to call the function with whatever arguments is *actually* trying to use those arguments to index the variable. If that is the case, you can `clear` the offending variable.
x(ind) should put out the x value at the index of the y maximum
You should read the documentation for `max` and also on the topic of indexing. 
This is a bizarre recursive function. I can't even see that it will terminate. Why is a being computed in a loop when it's not a function of the index? Why is matrix2 a cell array? 
&gt;Why is a being computed in a loop when it's not a function of the index? It is. Recall that the value x, is being passed in, is set by an index. Basically, this program just moves bit by bit to try every possible outcome.
Yes but that x was already passed in. I'm not sure you get how a recursive function works. At any single recursion depth, it's like a regular function. Also I'm now more sure that this won't ever complete. You call your function for every value of i between 1 and 10000. On each iteration you again call it for every value, etc. Since there's a special case for i = 1, each function call will return the first time, but the second time, it just recurses again. Forever. 
ind is the index at which the maximum value occurs. x(ind) is incorrect and v(ind) will yield the max value.
Ya you're right. This isn't a good representation. I'm just going to delete the question because it doesn't have enough information. Sorry.
Look at your loop. Read it line by line and explain what it's going to do at each step. 
It means exactly what it says. 
xmax = x(y==max(y)) xmax is the value of x when y is equal to the max of y. X and y must be the same dimension.
Are you getting stuck in the while loop? Perhaps toc is never exactly equal to 2 when evaluating. Maybe try &lt;= ?
For a better answer we'd need to know what your images look like because their complexity will affect how much filtering you'd need to do. Try googling counting objects through image segmentation in MATLAB, you might find the necessary information. Look into image segmentation and/or edge detection and image contours.
Also, your tic is inside your while loop... If the loop takes less than 2 seconds you'll never get out of it cause you're resetting your time. 
I wish MATLAB could offer torrent downloads... It is just a lot more robust for large downloads (as compared to regular browser downloads).
Cool, thanks for the response. Btw, have you contacted the mods about a custom flair for you, given that you write as a MW employee?
 for n = 1:N refnum = floor(numfiles/2+(n-1)); % define reference image refname = jpegFiles(refnum).name; % name of reference image ref = imread(refname); % read reference image nimnum = floor(numfiles/2+n); % define next image nimname = jpegFiles(nimnum).name; % name of next image nim = imread(nimname); % set image to be aligned [optimizer,metric] = imregconfig('monomodal'); % set imregconfig to monomodal nimreg = imregister(rgb2gray(nim), rgb2gray(ref), 'translation', optimizer, metric); % convert to grayscale, alignement wrimname = fullfile(destfolder, nimname); imwrite(nimreg,wrimname); % write image to folder /aligned % process images &lt; image in the middle refnum = floor(numfiles/2-(n-1)); % define reference image refname = jpegFiles(refnum).name; % name of reference image ref = imread(refname); % read reference image nimnum = floor(numfiles/2-n); % define next image nimname = jpegFiles(nimnum).name; % name of next image nim = imread(nimname); % set image to be aligned [optimizer,metric] = imregconfig('monomodal'); % set imregconfig to monomodal nimreg = imregister(rgb2gray(nim), rgb2gray(ref), 'translation', optimizer, metric); % convert to grayscale, alignement wrimname = fullfile(destfolder, nimname); imwrite(nimreg,wrimname); % write image to folder /aligned end Since n is only counting halfway and you are reusing variables names, you can put them in the same for loop. 
Made some changes based on this, basically placed the tic outside the loop so it starts a timer at the beginning, then inside the loop it will get the initial time (when the loop starts using a = toc) and then reads a second (b =) toc and takes the difference between the two (b-a) and if this differance is equal or greater than 2 it will hopefully = PWMvoltage=0 which should stop the motor (but doesnt). clearly some work needs to be done to figure this out. &amp;#x200B; I also have a motor which has a break cable, i was wondering if there might be a way for me to activate this when a variable is reached. I have no idea how to do this . any suggestions? &amp;#x200B;
For the pwm you probably need to set it to 0, I'm sure it doesn't reset itself. For the break cable, how do you plan to activate it?
Thanks for your reply! This takes as long as the solution with two for-loops since it is still serial but with a different order of processing. I intended to run the two for loops at the same time on two 'workers'. I have installed the Parallel Toolbox and thought that maybe parcluster was suitable for this but instead of reading the documentation on that I could as well read some ancient greek texts...
yea just realised that i was writing the voltage not the duty cycle, when writing the voltage=0 it doesnt stop. hopefully dutycycle =0 will work. I belive i have an option, I am considering using connecting it to the arduino and writing a PWM signal to it to when i need to. I belive this should work as this is basically what i am doing for the pwm voltage. If this works then it genuinely saves me a hell of alot of problems. Thank you for your help Btw
Is there any way to use double while? so the code would be like this; while First == 5 while (other variable == something) then the remainder of code end end &amp;#x200B;
ohhh, I thought you were asking something very different. If you have the parallel toolbox then switch the *for* command with *parfor* command. The loops will utilize multi-cores for the calculations. I wouldn't use parcluster until you are more familiar with the toolbox.
What have you tried? 
If you are running half the number of loop iterations but you now perform twice as many operations per loop, your code will take just as long to execute
First and foremost, I am using Matlab the third day today and my terminology might not be very accurate. The alignement has to be in a serial order, since the reference image in the middle is the basis for all the other images. The only chance to optimize this process - as far as I can see - is to run the two for loops on two cores at the same time. For example: if I have 5 images, the image no. 3 will be the reference, where the others are aligned to - in the first step images no. 2 and no. 4 are aligned to no. 3, then no. 1 is aligned to no. 2 and no. 5 to no. 4. Unfortunately it is not possible to align no. 1 directly to no. 3 since the differences are to big due to the different in-focus areas. A parfor-loop would do the latter. I use this skript to align 100-120 images. Somehow I need to encourage MATLAB to run the two for-loops on two cores. Thanks for your help again!
That's why I want MATLAB to run the two for-loops on two different cores somehow. Any ideas? I have Parallel Toolbox installed.
You can use parfor to run loops in parallel. I see that you’re using imread within your loops. Because you’re reading from the disk, rather than ram, I don’t know how much the parallelization will help. You could try preloading all of the images into 3D arrays. 
That's an idea, will try that, too. Thanks! Meanwhile I solved my problem using spmd: parpool(2) parfevalOnAll(@maxNumCompThreads, 0, 2) spmd if labindex == 1 first\_for-loop else second\_for-loop end end
type help contourf into the command line
Sounds good. Is it significantly faster?
Have done this with built in functions. I think there is a curve fit for Fourier sweeties though. Find your a0, an, bn terms and just write a for loop out for the summation including these terms in it. If you don’t want to integrate, just have wolfram alpha or any other silver do it for you. 
I have not, and that's a good point. I will do so. It would certainly save me a lot of time qualifying my posts!
**(Posting as a MathWorks employee)** &amp;#x200B; We recently launched a Simulink Onramp course, [available on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/69056-simulink-onramp). It walks you through the basics. It's the most decent tutorial we got! &amp;#x200B; For Simscape, [check out this article](https://www.mathworks.com/help/physmod/simscape/gs/essential-steps-for-constructing-a-physical-model.html) in Documentation to get started.
Matlab has two gridding functions: meshgrid and ndgrid. Your indicies into Z_vect follow ndgrid's convention. For meshgrid you'll need to flip ix &amp; iy: Z_vect(iy, ix) = X_vect(ix) + 2*Y_vect(iy); Also, I think you should rename Z_vect to Z_grid to be consistent with your other variables. 
I'd push for `rectangle` . It doesn't seem like you actually need `barh` to accomplish your goal.
Thanks for the advice! I've included two examples below: I think the complicated part is that hairs often overlap, so I wasn't sure if MATLAB would be able to make the distinction. &amp;#x200B; [https://imgur.com/a/aXS9EOZ](https://imgur.com/a/aXS9EOZ)
**If you try it out, be sure to add Matlab to you system's PATH**. It heavily relies on this and won't work without it. I do plan on perhaps adding an option to just paste the path to Matlab's installation folder in the VS Code settings.
I run Windows, and use VSCode for everything. I'm not able to look at this at the moment (busy day closing out before a long weekend), but I will definitely check this out when I get time. I'll be sure to give you some feedback when I do!
Thank you
That'd be great. Thanks!

Yes, you can do that but just a pointer, you're looking a little weird at while loops. Your while loops should usually look at values that are changing and for those that aren't you should use if statements. For instance, your original code has the while condition as something that's not read again in the while loop making it like an infinite loop you break out of with an if statement. Better practice would have been to make an if statement within which you have a while loop that checks the time. You normally want to break out of loops with a break if there's a condition you have which would need the loop not to finish executing. So for your original code I'd re-write it as If condition = 5 T=0 Toc While T&lt;2 Pwm code T=toc End End This is just a suggestion to have more proper code and avoid getting stuck in loops accidentally.
&gt;Okay, I think I get you, I'll give this a shot and get back to you. Thank you so much!
Thank you for this clear answer ! I didn't know ngrid, I see meshgrid used everywhere. I'll check the documentation for more details ! And you're right also about it the Zgrid two, makes it clearer.
I checked the documentation online but didn't found details about the Z input. Most examples use peaks() or meshgrid... Thus my question here. But thanks for the recommandation :) 
Not technically true. One hand doing a loop hasc quite a bit of overhead. In the other hand, Matlab had a jit compiler that can speed up some loops. Either way there will be some performance difference, and in some situations those differences can be significant.

 wordcloud() is pretty close to that.
Now, think about that code. Read it, without thinking about your assignment, just that code on its own. What would you expect it to do? 
I expect to plot a function with a period of 4 that from -2 to -1 the value is zero 
&gt; `t = linspace(-2,-1,4);` What do you think this actually does? I suggest you look at the documentation for `linspace`. &gt; `t = -2:2/400;` You need to look at t and understand what this is doing. &gt; `y = 0;` &gt; `plot(t,y)` Here, t is a vector but y is a scalar so this isn't going to work.
wat
I will like to plot e^(-abs(t)) and the code I came with is = exp(-1*abs(t));
Wat
I assume you're trying to code in that algorithm in a way MATLAB can interpret it. Not sure what the other commenters don't understand. Also, not sure how to do it.
You need to create a vector for time, with the desired spacing. Matlab can't work with continuous variables so you need to setup a vector with k samples...
This question deserves no attention until it is heavily clarified.
[Treemapping](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping) That’s a great question. Look at this [blog post](https://blogs.mathworks.com/pick/2016/07/15/treemap/) from math works referencing a file exchange upload. Should be a good start. 
Afaik, diff is not differential. Try help diff and thank me later.
I think your answer is correct. What's wrong?
I m so Sorry.. Uploaded Wrong pic.. But I figured it out right now by myself.. Thanks anyways.. 
i doubt it will work, there is no equivalent cli tool on windows for matlab. but i am interested as well keep us updated
is the idea here for the slider to move what row is getting histogrammed? you said there is going to be 4000 rows in your matrix. by default, the uitable will have its own slider that can scroll through the data. &amp;#x200B; I made a super fast example that you can use pasted below.

Did you check that the are sticky increasing values in input data of the map
You could try something like this for filtering: https://fr.mathworks.com/help/images/marker-controlled-watershed-segmentation.html You'll have to play around with it to get decent precision. The visible follicles will be much easier to count than the hairs since they're not overlapping and have distinguishable color.
Is there no variance in one of your columns after you removed the zeros?
no theres 100 different numbers ranging from 39 to 60
Well there goes my idea. Have you tried both corr and corrcoef? It might be easier to see what’s going on using corrcoef. 
Yes, I realize you think it will do what you want overall. I mean *line by line* what do you think is happening? &gt; t = linspace(-2,-1,4); What do you think is the value of `t` after this line executes? **Have you read the documentation for `linspace()`? &gt; y1 = 0; &gt; plot(t,y1) You're plotting `y1` as a function of `t`, yes? But you only have a single value for `y1`. I suspect you're getting an error that's telling you exactly why this doesn't work. Right? What's that error say? **have you read the documentation for `plot()`?** I could repeat the same comments for the second half of the code. **what do you think each line of your code does? How does this understanding compare to the documentation for the functions you've used?**
I'd use [`scatter` ](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/scatter.html) and make the density of traffic be the color. Put the markers dense enough and it will look like a solid line. 
You're having a scope problem. By default, MATLAB passes by value, so inside your sub-function you are only modifying a copy of your object. You can either make your sub-function a [nested function](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/nested-functions.html) or you can return the object back into your main function. 
Interesting. I thought this was the issue but I realized that in my previous code I never had to pass my object as an output and I still retained the properties I assigned in my methods. Perhaps there was something else going on in terms of the scope that wasn't making the issue present in my previous code. This did seem to fix the issue though. Thanks.
Depending on the structure of your data, I usually like binscatter() or images()
Ah I haven't seen this function before but I'm keen to give it a try. It was updated a year ago and is still receiving reviews, so I'm assuming it's still the best tool to use.
You could use the Leadscrew Joint Block, as shown in this example: https://www.mathworks.com/help/physmod/sm/examples/using-the-lead-screw-joint-block-linear-actuator.html The example is probably not exactly what you're trying to achieve, but it can get you started. You could also try the Rack and Pinion block, but it seems like you're describing a linear actuator, and many of the ones I've encountered use lead screws.
If you open the eps file in something like Illustrator or Inkscape you’ll probably see that the text is there it’s just got a clipping mask on top of it. So something in your code may be causing it. How does it behave with a simple plot? Can you provide a minimal working example?
But how do you 3d model them? The motion to be precise. 
As I understand it, you just need to solid bodies, and when you constrain them with this block, it will give you linear motion. Let's say you have two solid bodies (or two solids)- the lead screw and the nut. You would connect the lead screw to the "Base" part of the Leadscrew constraint, and the lead nut to the "Follower Side." Then, when the leadscrew body rotates, the nut body will move. That's exactly what you will see in the 3D animation. In order for the above scenario to work, the lead screw body must be connected to a Revolute Joint Block, which will allow it rotate. You can also specify rotation speed and torque of the revolute joint.
When I first found it ~2012, it was amazing. The Github page has a full explanation of all the neat extras it does.
It depends on what you are working. Personally, I save my fog with savefig or the saveas functions. And the one I need to print into pdf, I use the "print" option when the fig is open. It's in my opinion the best option if you only need few plots. 
Scatter definitely sounds like the way to go for this, thanks :) 
Would something like 100*x + 10*y' do the trick? Om mobile and mot sure if transpose indeed works but you could just use repmat if not. 
I tried it with two nested for-loops from 1:n and that appears to be working as of now.
n = numel(X); vector = \[ repmat(X',n,1) repelem(Y',n,1) zeros(n\*n,1) \];
Thank you, yes that's the idea. Except, instead of rotating , I want the lead screw to move linearly. Otherwise, I just end of creating a pendulum. But my idea is, the gear train move in linear steps and gimbals the engine nozzle. 
Personally, I like to use simscape multibody to model systems I've imported from CAD ( Solidworks is my go to but they support several systems ) Look into "simscape multibody link" if you are interested in modeling your assembly that way. Its best to limit your mates to only kinematically important ones so the imported model is not a mess. For your actuator, just pick a joint that gives you linear motion (like the cylinder joint) and set it's motion to be given via a physical signal (you will need to provide the trajectory) and it's force/torque to be simulated. Then you can create a sensor in the joint for force/torque assuming that is what you are interested in getting out of your simulation. 
If anyone has a similar issue using COMSOL, the fix I've found was to export the mesh as a NASTRAN file and manually clear it of any information other than the lines beginning with the string GRID, from there I scan it line per line with fgetl to get the index of the point in the mesh and to get the x, y and z coordinates. From there it's possible to work on the project :)

If you want to use a 3d model to represent this use vredit() to launCh a vr world editor. this can be linked to simulink and import a 3d cad model to animate your design.
You can use the function num2str to add both numbers together then convert it back to a double.
When you generate your points, just generate all of them instead of shifting your function. t=-3:0.01:3 Your evaluation for f remains unchanged and you just use a single plot command. Also, I'm not sure your current plot is correct because you have sharp discontinuities. I don't think this function is periodic on (-1,1) because of the t^2 term. Good luck!
thanks for the reply, but if i did change t to -3 to 3 then it wouldnt be repeating in the way i need it. i linked the actual work sheet in the imgur link if you want to have a look
thanks for the help but if i did change t to -3 to 3 then it wouldnt be the function i need. i linked the actual worksheet to the imgur link if you want to have a read
I see. I misunderstood. I'm not sure I'd call it efficient but you could just stack the vectors and you'd only need a single plot command. t = [t-2; t; t+2]; f = [f; f; f]; This would use more memory but the code may look cleaner. I'm not sure the shape of your vectors. Above would work for column vectors so you may need to transpose them first.
&gt;Above would work for column vectors so you may need to transpose them first. Or just skip the semicolons.
Matlab tells you exactly what the problem is: you are using "G" without defining it. Where does the error happen? (My quick scan says line 69 "compboard(guesscolumn, guessrow) = G;". Here you are using G but you haven't told Matlab what G is. But this seems to be a script. Is G supposed to be defined outside this script?)
Yes the error happens in line 69. That was me trying to define the variable as the value at compboard(guesscolumn, guessrow) . How should I structure it? Thanks
Here's a small script for you to play with: a = 3; % Create the variable "a" and assign it the value 3. b = a; % Create the variable "b" and assign it the value of variable "a" 2 = a; % ERROR! This doesn't make sense. You cannot assign the value 2 something, 2 is always 2! a = c; % ERROR! You are trying to assign "a" the value of "c", but "c" doesn't exist! You are doing this: compboard(guesscolumn, guessrow) = G; But you probably want to do this: G = compboard(guesscolumn, guessrow);
I took a look through your code (quickly - I'm not reading that much code in detail) and I didn't even see the variable `G` above line 69. What are you expecting the value of this variable to be at this point in the program? How should it have gotten this value? 
I was trying to set the value of the variable to the value at the point (guesscolumn, guessrow) of the compboard matrix.
Use meshgrid. I.e [X1,Y1] = meshgrid (X(:),Y(:)); V=[X1(:), Y1(:), zeros (size(X1(:)))]; Then, if you need it as a string, I believe you can use num2str on an array.
Then it looks like you have written it backwards. The instruction A = B; means "take the value of `B` and assign it to `A`". It never means "take the value of `A` and assign it to `B`", no matter what you wanted. Matlab only knows what you wrote, not what you meant. 
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to see here. I use eps for everything and have not encountered a problem.
I use print for everything. It's dead simple and just works.
You could try this: t1 = -3:0.001:3; t = mod(t1+3,2)-1; f = (1 - t.^2).*cos(3.*pi.*t); plot(t1,f) 
I guess so, at least it fells like that. For the next stack I will take the time.
You're trying to sum matrices with different dimensions. My linear algebra's pretty rusty, but unless you're using a different type of matrix addition, this will always generate an error.
what do you mean with combine? Do you want to plot two histograms together ? If yes you can do: hold on histogram(data1) histogram(data2) hold off 
Ah yes, my mistake! I wonder how I should go about finding a linear combination of R(A) and N(A) that satisfies x differently? Maybe I should pad the matrices with zeros? Anyways, thanks for taking your time!
Oh, I mean to add each bin of the first histogram to the same bin of the other histogram. But I’m not sure this is the best approach. In the end I want a histogram of the average over the 1000 randomisations. (If that makes sense!!)
You'd want to use `histcounts`. Call it first outside the loop to capture the automatic bins: [N0,edges] = histcounts(X) then call it inside the loop passing passing the previous bins: N = histcounts(X,edges) all you have to do then is accumulate the counts inside the loop: N0 = N0 + N; once finished you can plot the final histogram. 
Besides piracy and paying the money, the main option is [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) -- it's a free version of MATLAB, and there's a good chance it can run the code you have as-is.
Run a virtual box and just reformat it monthly if you insist. Your university should have cheap licenses for students available - like $50-75. It's easily worth the price for the software. Octave is a free alternative with similar functionality, but this sub isn't the place for that. I'd generally try to discourage piracy, so try your best to pursue legitimate means... Even if that means doing your work on a campus computer.
Home license is also ~$150...totally worth it
it would be worth it if i used it a lot, but i literally have one program to write for my course thats it
Thanks for your reply. I've solved it, and believe it was to do with the way I was using subplot. Essentially I was making some changes to the geometry of the figure boundaries, which was causing the plot to shift outside of the window (I think). Also having '-loose' within my print command helped too. This problem only occurred while using eps. Cheers!
Thank you for documenting! I'll be sure to look out for this one.
This worked, thank you!
I am using a barh() not a histogram, i struggled to get your code to work how would i go about using the uitable method? &amp;#x200B;
That fundamentally makes no sense. There's no way to element-wise sum 5 numbers with 4 numbers. What would that even mean? 
you dont have enough variables for a polynomial fit but using the cftool() you should be able to use an interpolated spline curve to represent your results.
How are you computing z? If it's a function only of x and y then something like [X, Y] = meshgrid(x,y); Z = myFunc(X,Y); contour(Z) is a really good way to do it. If your z comes from something like expensive experiments like drilling for gold then you may want to do something like a kriging interpolation with [fitrgp](https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/fitrgp.html) and then use the prediction method on that result applied to the mesh grid above.
the main thing going on here is the uitable1\_CellSelectionCallback function. alter that for your use case. if you are using GUIDE to make your GUI, right click on the table and select "callback functions", then "cellSelectionCallback". &amp;#x200B; % --- Executes when selected cell(s) is changed in uitable1. function uitable1\_CellSelectionCallback(hObject, eventdata, handles) % hObject handle to uitable1 (see GCBO) % eventdata structure with the following fields (see MATLAB.UI.CONTROL.TABLE) % Indices: row and column indices of the cell(s) currently selecteds % handles structure with handles and user data (see GUIDATA) selectionIndices = eventdata.Indices; selectedRow = selectionIndices(1); axes(handles.axes1) data = get(handles.uitable1,'data'); plotData = data(selectedRow,:); plot(plotData)
May want to consider a pseudoinverse and the [Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra](http://www.souravsengupta.com/cds2016/lectures/Strang_Paper1.pdf).
Thank you!
Thank you!
Without context it's pretty meaningless. 
Why would you want to use symbolic variables for this? If you have a numerical description of your problem and want a numerical result, just use numerical integration. 
its in a modelling module, the notes refer to the parasitic solution/ computational mode, but i dont actaully know the definition of a mode, i understand what the parasitic solution is though, sorry i did not explain 
Sounds like something related to what you are working on. 
What's the topic of what you're working on?
basically we numerically solve an ode and the solution is in the form x= e^-...t + e^...t and he says that last exponential term is called the parasitic solution which i geet, as t gets large the solution becomes corrupted because of it. he also called it the computational mode and says roundoff error projects onto it and grows to corrupt the solution. i was just curious as to what mode actually means but its not that important 
It sounds like you are doing [Eigenmode Decomposition/Expansion ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenmode_expansion). The modes can be thought of as fundamental building blocks of the solution.

As in most languages, there are multiple ways of doing something and everyone picks their standards based on their preferences. I understand the search for standard practices, but as far as I know, there are none in Matlab and it's high flexibility doesn't "help". I think a "local consensus" could be more helpful, take a look around at code made by colleagues and mimick that. As for documentation, I always try to mimick Matlab's own style as much as possible. Reference: I'm a neuroscience PhD student working day and night with Matlab with a supervisor who has quite a different programming style than I have
That's what I was thinking, but to calculate the moment of inertia I need a symbolic y^2 in the integrand I think?
May I ask... why?
A few things I can think of immediately: * Vectorize whenever possible. Avoid for loops. This simplifies code and will speed up code. * Comment everywhere. But don't write bad comments. Errors in comments are errors in code. * Specific to Matlab, use sparse matrices efficiently. They can extremely speedup your code if used properly. Or, they can be a great waste of time.
Thank you! This worked great.
Z is a separate variable representing quality and isn't directly related to X and Y. Nevertheless, I'll look into fitrgp. Thank you!
I'm just as confused as you. The assignment I was given had the question phrased like that. 
Thank you, these are excellent suggestions. I already comment a ton and I make sure my variables are names well. I may even take too much care, like I use "qq" or "ii" for loop progression variables just in case a single letter may unintentionally interact with a built in matlab variable. Its an old habit from college I never dropped. I definitely need to work on vectorization instead of for loops and I will look into using sparse matrices more as well. The current bodies of data I deal with are small enough to where suboptimal functions still work well but I really shouldn't get complacent with that situation
Or just use Matlab? What am I missing here?
You never need symbols to do numerical integration. I'm not sure I understand what you're saying. 
s = serial('COM4','BaudRate',115200,'Terminator','CR') fopen(s); fread(s) fclose(s); (i am guessing the terminator)
Command output too long to comment, i will send if someone needs to see it 
I can recommend [this very nice style guide](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46056-matlab-style-guidelines-2-0?s_tid=FX_rc1_behav) on FileExchange written by Richard Johnson. There's also [a paperback version](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Matlab-Style-Richard-Johnson/dp/0521732581), which I bought when I started grad school. It's got quite a lot of handy information like syntax and naming conventions, vectorization tips, shortcuts to take and those to avoid, data structure choices, and so on. A style guide is one of the first things I look for when learning a new language.
My guess is they want the sexy Atom dark theme?
Did you read the thread over at [atom.io](https://atom.io)? [https://discuss.atom.io/t/running-matlab-code-from-atom/38939](https://discuss.atom.io/t/running-matlab-code-from-atom/38939) 
I'm not sure if this will do the trick, but instead of fclose(s) use fclose(instrfind). That seemed to do the trick when I executed my script when I needed to write to the serial port. Hope this helps!
Hi, a follow up.... any reason why matlab is stripping off the CRS coordinate from my jp2 when i convert to a tiff? and any way to retain that info?
Without an example of what you get and what you expect it's hard to tell... Assuming the baud rate you're using is correct and you're not trying to read from the com via Matlab and Arduino IDE at the same time I'd say try fscanf instead of fread.
R is a matrix defined by yoy starting at -10 with a 0.1 increment and finishing in 10.
Tried it and didnt seem to do anything. thanks anyway
This is awesome, thank you for bringing it to my attention!
You're most welcome!
its a distance sensor so the expected values would be the distance my hand is from the sensor. the values which are coming out when i change what you said are this; [https://imgur.com/il98Ovg](https://imgur.com/il98Ovg) &amp;#x200B;
You're reading a buffer. So if you do it once, you'll only get as much data as fits in the buffer once. You'll have to put fscanf into a loop and maybe set how much data you want to read at a time (usually third argument of fscanf after format). I'd also put the format of data you want (string? -&gt; fscanf(s,'%s') ) You could keep using fread but you'd probably need to use sscanf to convert it to the right format after it's read. 
You can split your y equation like this: y1 = y(find(y&lt;0.5)); y2 = y(find(y&gt;=0.5)); You'd have to double both arrays. Your y1 should be doubled and flipped. You can flip it by making y1=max(y1)-y1 or using flip function directly zhen plotting. Your y2 should be doubled and shifted down by 1 (y2=y2*2-1)
This solved it! Thank you so much. &amp;#x200B; One last question: How do i plot y1 and y2 in the same graph ?
You can either split your t and use "hold on" to plot two plots on the same graph or better, use horzcat or vertcat. If your arrays are horizontal, y = horzcat(y1,y2) and plot that
That nearly solved it! Now i got this: [https://imgur.com/cjwUpl9](https://imgur.com/cjwUpl9) Is there a way to push the start of the graph to 1 ?
To adjust axis you should be using xlim and ylim
Because I don’t like Matlab’s native editor. 
I guess i can't make it better than that... THANK YOU SO MUCH! 
Because it is a crappy editor. 
because of the comma before the ellipsis 
So set your Matlab IDE preferences to use a different editor. Preferences -&gt; Editor/Debugger -&gt; Text Editor.

I tried deleting them and still ran into errors, Error: File: PolyIntMain.m Line: 6 Column: 5 Invalid expression. Check for missing multiplication operator, missing or unbalanced delimiters, or other syntax error. To construct matrices, use brackets instead of parentheses. 
It might be simpler to code if you fprintf the instructions and then input A in a separate command.
Double check your data types and sizes.
Couple things. First, the terminator is much more likely to be LF than CR. CR is used in windows or doors type systems, but not often elsewhere. Outputting a \n on the Arduino will correspond to a LF. Second, it's important to remember that the Arduino will reset when new serial connections are made. Your program should wait an appropriate amount of time for your Arduino code (and sensor) to start up, before you make serial requests.
Adding to my previous comment, how does the Arduino know when to send the data? You open the serial port, attempt to read from it, and then close it, but how does the Arduino know to send during this exact time? It's common to set up the Arduino to wait for some string (could be any serial data, or something like a '?'), and then respond to it with your sensor reading. You'd send that out in Matlab, and then wait for the response.
Hi, I really enjoyed reading this. Thanks for the detailed background on the problem description. I smooth a lot of 2D slices of 3D datasets, but I typically take a spline approach to it. Specifically, I'd recommend checking out slmengine - it's a free add-on for Matlab that requires the fitting toolbox. It's quite powerful for the additional constraints that may be imposed on the fit, e.g. positive first and or second derivatives over certain fit ranges. To smooth the entire dataset you have in a broad manner, check out fit or smooth3, which should give you access to different smoothing criteria such as Lowess/loess, and a gaussian blur, respectably Good luck!
Another thing to check out on file exchange: [regularizeNd](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/61436-regularizend) Made by a coworker of mine, I think it could be useful for you.
So what did you try?
This seems simple; you need a function that selects even numbers in a sequence and identifies spaces between words so as to identify the second word. Take your time to figure out how you could do these mathematically.
Actually, what I'm doing does make sense fundamentally. A 5x3 matrix multiplied with a 3x1 vector gives me a 5x1 vector and a 5x2 matrix multiplied with a 2x1 vector gives me a 5x1 vector. I want to find these two, 3x1 and 2x1 vectors that satisfy this equation. Shouldn't matlab be capable of solving that? 
Udemy or direct matlab website
Matlab documentation is very good for learning how functions work. Personally I like to learn by doing and Mathworks have a special place with interactive problems. You can find some problems to solve on www.mathworks.com/matlabcenter/cody/
I also vote for mathworks website. There are not a ton of 3rd party options partially because mathworks offers good training and docs: &amp;#x200B; [https://www.mathworks.com/support/learn-with-matlab-tutorials.html](https://www.mathworks.com/support/learn-with-matlab-tutorials.html) 
i just spent about an hour trying to get fprintf to work the way i wanted haha.
So the thing about a freshman level MATLAB course is that, typically, the professor will give assignments that some freshmen will likely have forgotten how to do or have never seen before. &gt; We had roughly 6 hours of lessons but none of the stuff covered in the lessons are things we need to use for the assignment It sounds like the professor taught you the syntax of MATLAB with those six hours and wants you to expand on it by solving problems with a bit more depth to them. My professor did the same thing. &gt; i find it very hard to learn from there as a lot of time they want to provide a solution and that solution doesnt help with my understanding of what I am actually doing Do you know how to do those problems by hand but not in MATLAB? Or can you do those problems in MATLAB but not by hand? I might be misunderstanding your situation. Regardless, without giving you a solution, the first two specific questions you have can both be done by using [this Wiki page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line–line_intersection) as a reference. The trajectory problem can be done in multiple ways, depending on what information you have to work with.

**Line–line intersection** In Euclidean geometry, the intersection of a line and a line can be the empty set, a point, or a line. Distinguishing these cases and finding the intersection point have use, for example, in computer graphics, motion planning, and collision detection. In three-dimensional Euclidean geometry, if two lines are not in the same plane they are called skew lines and have no point of intersection. If they are in the same plane there are three possibilities: if they coincide (are not distinct lines) they have an infinitude of points in common (namely all of the points on either of them); if they are distinct but have the same slope they are said to be parallel and have no points in common; otherwise they have a single point of intersection. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/matlab/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
I can do the logical steps on paper. Like I know what I’m trying to do. It’s making matlab do it that’s hard. I just spent about an hour trying to get fprintf to display two coordinates with a line saying “the coordinates of intersection = “. It’s stuff like that I find so hard to understand. YouTube helped a lot with that one and a lot of trial and error. 
Well to be honest fprintf has never really been intuitive (not completely unintuitive either though) to anyone using MATLAB the first time, especially if it’s their first programming language. MATLAB shines in numerical applications. 
Mathworks website for sure and their youtube channel is amazing.
Please see our [rules for submitting homework questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/462uwe/submitting_homework_questions_read_this/), specifically the part where you share what you've tried and where you're stuck. 
This is actually something really easy to do in MATLAB, and it uses a special feature that I'm pretty sure is only in MATLAB (and probably some Python packages emulating it), which is [logical indexing](https://blogs.mathworks.com/loren/2013/02/20/logical-indexing-multiple-conditions/). In this case, it's as simple as: td = dataset1 == dataset2;
You need to use the isequal's output to get the value from the from the initial vectors. As in, c=isequal(a, b) then use a(c) to get the exact values.
tl;dr improving your search skills is a must for effective learning. Try to break down your problem into chunks that might have generic solutions, then string together your solutions. It may seem like a long time but a few hours for learning fprintf probably gave you more than a print function. The experience of googling stuff, watching youtube videos, and overall searching for resources to get you from knowing nothing to being able to do the thing is an important skill to have. You’re on the right track, keep it up :) You’ll improve your search skills over time and be able to find the resources that best fit your problem. Consume a variety of resources and figure out which ones helped you understand the best. Then look for more of those kinds of resources. As for resources, I recommend breaking your problem down into independent steps that you can find generic examples for. For example, try searching for examples of calculating the intersection of two (lines or planes), generating data points to represent a given function (such as sine), plotting a set of points, etc. Searching for independent components might yield results that are more relevant than if you had searched for something like “plot the intersection of two planes” or “plot the trajectories of a projectile”. 
That’s what I struggle with mathworks so much. I ask for a solution to a smaller problem so I can learn it step by step. They then ask what am I trying to do and write a the whole solution in one line and I’m like - ok what? I’ll get there with it. Spend a long time today working on it and was getting into my grove then had to stop and go to work. 
Yeah I feel... Posting on mathworks is good for mathworks specific issues (like license problems). I avoid asking on mathworks for generic programming problems because that community has a culture of focusing on the solution rather than the process. I almost always end up on stackoverflow when searching for help. At your experience level, chances are someone has asked the same (or similar question) in another programming language. The more popular languages (Java or Python) might be foreign languages to you at this point but the answers might still be similar enough for you to translate into matlab. Unfortunately, you might not be able to avoid this time consuming process when learning. Look for pseudocode or try to decipher the steps involved in generating the result by reading other people’s code.

Okay that worked, thanks a lot :D
If you're getting that error, that means you have a vector somewhere that requires the dot modifier. The easiest way to ensure you fix that problem is to simply use the dot modifier everywhere you use multiplication or division when you aren't trying to do matrix math.
This would be my advice too. There's no drawback to multiplying scalars with the elementwise multiplication, so I usually get in the habit of using '.\*' for all multiplication unless I'm specifically doing matrix math. For reference, though, if 't' is a vector, then I believe your problem is the matrix multiplication indicated in the first line below: [Vector] [Matrix mult] [Vector] exp(.05*2*pi*t-.5) * ((.0018*cos(6.275*t-.5)) ... [Scalar] [Vector] +((-1.3256e-18+.05*2*pi*.0018)/6.275)*sin(6.275*t-.5))) &amp;#x200B;
Your problem consists of two parts; the first is detecting the even lines and the second is storing or printing the second word of every even line. &amp;#x200B; For the first part, you can simply use any loop with an increment of 2 to only access the even lines. For the second part, I would have another loop (so you will have to use nested loops) that keeps accessing every letter in the sentence and storing it anywhere (a variable for example). It should only "break" out of the loop whenever an empty variable is detected. Do the exact same thing again to detect where the next empty variable is. You will then be able to locate the second word and print it out. &amp;#x200B; Good luck! 
Try the onramps, [https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/), also find out if your school has access to their other courses.
Depends on if you're in app designer or guide. Something similar to this would work in guide: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/25483-change-button-color-and-text-after-it-is-clicked
Matlab has no syntax for multiline strings. Instead, you must concatenate them with the concatenation `[]` operator, like so: A=input(['Input an array with the first two number equal to the bounds of integration,/n', ... 'the third number equal to the number of pieces for the intigrand to be broken into,/n',... 'and numbers after that equal to the numbers in front of each coefficiant/n',... 'counting downwards the last numbers coefficiant is equal to zero.']); What you are doing here is concatenating four separate strings, each defined on a separate line. FYI, for readability, you'd be better off defining your string earlier: input_str = ['Input an array with the first two number equal to the bounds of integration,/n', ... 'the third number equal to the number of pieces for the intigrand to be broken into,/n',... 'and numbers after that equal to the numbers in front of each coefficiant/n',... 'counting downwards the last numbers coefficiant is equal to zero.']; A = input(input_str);
off-topic, but you should use anonymous functions instead of `inline`: P = @(t) exp(.05*2*pi*t-.5)*... 
when using an anonymous function, how would you plot a situation where P is Y for t&lt;.5 and P is X for t&gt;=.5? 
I don't see any complex numbers in your code anywhere, so complex conjugation should be an identity. 
Usually, I think a Kalman filter is used for this. Unless somebody has already written a Kalman filter that suits your purposes, you'll have to do it yourself. There won't always be nice pre-written functions to do highly complex and domain specific tasks for you. 
&gt; for length = 418 &gt; td = isequal(dataset1, dataset2) &gt; end I think you need to look at the documentation on for loops. Nowhere in your loop body do you use the loop index. Also, your loop index is named the same as a built-in Matlab function, which is bad. 
What do you mean exactly? I have terms like i*x6(z), which when I make i*x6 actually produces the result I want. The problem is that I then have to find the partial derivative of this conjugate with respect to z. 
Quick question, is there something like the ``==`` operator but for tables instead? I want to compare every row in two different tables and output 1 if the values are the same, and 0 if they're not (so just like in this one). I tried the ``==`` but I guess it only works on simple matrices.
`ix6` is a variable name. `i * x6` is a complex number with imaginary part equal to `x6`
Thanks for this link, might check it out for my own purposes.
I figured it out. I probably should of been more specific in my pots but I was having an issue with the fget1 function, as it wasn't working correctly, so I copied the fget1 function into it's "function" file and saved it, and got it working. Here's the finished product; &amp;#x200B; fn = input('file name: ', 's'); fh = fopen( fn, 'r' ); ln = ''; count=0; while ischar( ln ) ln=fget1(fh); ln=fget1(fh); if mod(count,2)==0 \[tk, ln\] = strtok( ln ); \[tk, ln\] = strtok( ln ); count=count+2; disp(tk); end end fclose( fh );
Hm, I never realized logical indexing wasn't common in other languages - I use it relentlessly.
I've changed that and I'm still getting conj(x2(z)) etc. It's odd that if I make it just x2 , x3, etc, it works.
You can't index all those at the same time like that.
What are the 9 degree of freedom out of interest? The 6 would be translation of the local coordinate system x, y, z and rotations pitch, roll and yaw.
This disp([t,ax,ay,az](1:10,:)); isn't allowed. You can either index each variable independently or you can max a different variables which is all of those things, and then index it. 
He did it and it worked fine when he ran it, any ideas why? I thought the same thing that you couldn’t index like that but he did.
That’s what I thought to, but it worked for him, the only difference is that he’s using octave.
Did you see it actually run? Cause that doesn't work in MATLAB. 
Yep, no errors on his part.
He must be a magical wizard of some kind
Maybe lol, thanks for your help though!
&gt; the only difference is that he’s using ~~octave~~ different software than I am. Octave and Matlab are similar, but they're not the same software. This doesn't work in MATLAB. 
Got you, thanks for your help!
I'm not sure but you could use xlsread to read only part of the file. 
I can't because that's not how he wants it done. However, I thought you could only use xlsread on xls files only, not csv ones?
if these are column vectors then you can merge them side by side by doing: [t ax ay az]; You are not then indexing multiple variables but 1 matrix which should be fine as far as I can tell. 
Having an imu alone is not enough. You need a GPS or any position measurement system to avoid integration drift. This problem is far from being straightforward. There are major. Issue with gyros drift, gravity management in the accelerometer, etc. You can find several algorithms in the diy drone community. They may provide open-source code for arduino, etc. 
Usually Matlab code will work in Octave, but Octave code frequently doesn't work in Matlab. This is one of those times. Fortunately, the differences are well documented. In this case, the issue is that Octave has what they call "[coherent syntax](http://wiki.octave.org/FAQ#Coherent_syntax)" Here are a few pages that list differences between Matlab and Octave: [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/MATLAB\_Programming/Differences\_between\_Octave\_and\_MATLAB](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/MATLAB_Programming/Differences_between_Octave_and_MATLAB) [http://wiki.octave.org/FAQ#Differences\_between\_Octave\_and\_Matlab](http://wiki.octave.org/FAQ#Differences_between_Octave_and_Matlab) [http://wiki.octave.org/FAQ#What\_features\_are\_unique\_to\_Octave.3F](http://wiki.octave.org/FAQ#What_features_are_unique_to_Octave.3F) 
I guess I'm not sure what else it would show? 
Thank you! Someone below said the same that although they are very similar they do have differences and I’m guessing this being one of them.
This is what I thought about doing originally as I figured matlab couldn’t index it that way, but I thought maybe I was doing something wrong. Turns out that is one of the differences between matlab and octave. In octave it works but not in matlab.
x1 etc are dependent on a variable z, I need this to perform the partial differentiation on the conjugate. 
Thanks, this helped me figure out what i need! i just downloaded the home version with curve fitting toolbox. I'm excited to pick up where i left off in college.
Thanks I too will be checking this out
No, I might have not clearly explained this. A 3 axis magnetometer is also in the IMU. So 3 axis accelerometer, 3 axis gyro, and 3 axis magnetometer. However, I will be using this sensor underground so the magnetometer can't really be utilized. 
How does a while loop work? Can you figure out a way to keep it running or make it exit based on the user entry?
UCM??
Pass a second parameter through for the value of P. May not work if you want to evaluate t over the full range without some more modifications. 
The documentation. 
There is a lot going on in this homework assignment, so try to work on it in terms of things you can test most easily. In this case, the easiest bit to test would be prompting the user for a value and rejecting the value with a warning when it is out of bounds. It sounds like this works? So then the next step would be getting the program to repeatedly ask the user for inputs. A major component of the while loop structure you need is making sure you can end it! As you have a valid range of values, select a value that isn't valid (perhaps -1) and build that into your if-else logic to turn your while loop off. while( run_loop == 1 ) if( input == -1 ) end end
I dont understand. Please elaborate
What woukd the negative one do in the while loop
Take a look at the examples in the documentation for [mean](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mean.html). It may cover what you want. I wasn't using Matlab 10 years ago, so maybe this wasn't the case back then, but now the documentation is very thorough and altogether excellent, so much so that regular users lean on it heavily. 
Awesome thanks! I will check it out
The while loop runs as long as its condition is true. So if you need to keep taking inputs, you need it to run until you tell it to stop. So the user has to be the one to stop it.
I understand the while loop now, thanks but i still get confuse with the syntax. Would you care to help me out?
Also, it’s best practice to not use i as the complex number since it is a common index variable. Instead, use 1i or 1j to remove any ambiguity
As far as I know, the symbolic toolbox does not allow you to make assumptions about functions. Instead of using x1(z), etc. what if you use real(x1(z)), or just define x1, etc as variables, then manually replacing them with functions later on?
You will need something like an extended Kalman filter to track the orientation/position (extended because you have a nonlinear system). There are lots of papers and books about creating an EKF for your exact purpose. At a glance, I found a paper on arxiv about tracking position and orientation: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.06053.pdf It also looks like matlab provides an example: https://www.mathworks.com/help/fusion/examples/imu-and-gps-fusion-for-inertial-navigation.html
hmmm are you making sure when you are outputting to workspace you are chosing the correct data type? (ie timeseries, array, etc) the default maybe different. I have not installed 19a yet. Good luck!
Try reading up on clf, rather than hold off. It would work like clf(h) If h is your figure handle.
I have some advice. Stop this craziness immediately. In my experience there is NEVER a good reason to use the symbolic toolbox. The fact is, MATLAB does a lot of things extremely well and symbolic computation is not one of those things. What you are proposing is to spend an insane amount of time coding up a hacky version of a piece of software which isn't very useful to being with. I can't help but ask why? If you need symbolic computation, use an actual CAS. I recommend SAGE. 
xleft=0; xriqht=(9*pi)/2; N=20; x=linspace(xleft,xright,N); x=x' dx=(xright-xleft)/(N-1); yleft=1; yright=1; a=1; b=-2; c=-2; M2=(diag(-2.ones(N,1),0)+diag(ones(N-1,1),-1)+diag(ones(N-1,1),1))/dx^2; M1=(diag(ones(N-1,1),1)-diag(ones(N-1,1),-1))/(2*.dx); M0=eye(N) M=aM2+bM1+cM0 b= b(l) = yleft; b(end) = yright; y=M\b;
I couldn’t put the full code in but how do I enter the second order function in here I know it goes to where b is at 
xleft=0; xriqht=(9*pi)/2; N=20; x=linspace(xleft,xright,N); x=x' dx=(xright-xleft)/(N-1); yleft=1; yright=1; a=1; b=-2; c=-2; M2=(diag(-2.ones(N,1),0)+diag(ones(N-1,1),-1)+diag(ones(N-1,1),1))/dx^2; M1=(diag(ones(N-1,1),1)-diag(ones(N-1,1),-1))/(2*.dx); M0=eye(N) M=aM2+bM1+cM0 b= b(l) = yleft; b(end) = yright; y=M\b;
B is where I think I need to enter in the ode but how do I do it 
Really just for enjoyment and so I can implement some Numerical Analysis techniques that require symbolic derivatives, like Newton's method and whatnot
It should not be used as an index variable. 
In no way, shape, or form does Newton’s method require symbolic derivatives. In fact, just about anything that falls under the umbrella of numerical analysis doesn’t require symbolic derivatives and that’s kinda the point. 
I have a career based almost completely on solving a particular type of inverse problem via optimization with Newtons method -like algorithms. I have never needed the symbolic toolkit. The 4 inch thick table of integrals on my bookshelf? Yes, many times. Symbolic Toolbox? Lolno. 
Same as any other time you want to plot something. 
Pirate that shit
Why would you want one? The classic definition is classic for a reason. It is the first moment of the data. Also, all of statistics is based on that number. If you came up with a new number, how would you use it to describe a normal distribution?
I'll give that a go, thank you! 
Can't remember correctly, but some time ago I used isonormals or isosurface to create 3d object from ultrsound data.
Are you asking if there is a different way in the case the data isn't a normal distribution? If it is normal I don't think there is a much better way than SSD.
Yes, like for e.g. the noise in an image, or the image details, a part more flat, and another one more textured. 
I just created a simple model in R2018b with a double timeseries output and ran it again in R2019a. No issues. &amp;#x200B; Can you provide more details on the model? Perhaps it's a configuration issue.
The values of partitions of the empirical distribution, quartiles for example, may be handy. It's particularly nice on data like net worth of the US population because there are acutually several different overlapping sub populations.
Matlab is real cool. See those orange squigly lines in the editor (where you type your script), if you mouse over them matlab gives you hints. 
But they don't help with my problem.
What does it say when you mouseover the '=' in \` b=ismember(0,a\_column(i,1)\^2-a\_column)\`
Hm, intereseting. Yeah, [here](http://prntscr.com/n6wshy) is a screenshot of the model with to workspace parameters dialog box open. And [here](http://prntscr.com/n6wzia) is a screenshot of the code. Interestingly enough, I just ran a sim I made in 2018b (super similar, just a loop to solve a differential equation with one to workspace block) and it worked fine. Could it be something with the default settings for 2019a or something? Thanks for offering your thoughts! What other detail would you like?
"Terminate statement with semicolon...." But then my answer is only "ans=0" and this is exactly not what I want! 
Your answer was only b=0 even before adding the semi-colon. Look at how you store a. How would you make b take the same format as a in order to return the same number of answers?
right. So, you need to supress output of the line that generates ans = 0 with a semicolon, and not the lines with the b. Where do you think that comes from? 
 b doesn't have to take the same format as a. The output format of my answer is fine, it's just the last "ans" I want to suppress.
&gt; So, you need to supress output of the line that generates ans = 0 with a semicolon...Where do you think that comes from? Idk?! That is my question?! If I put after the for-loop, the "ans" turns into a "b" and then I have 4x b, instead of 3. 
If you indent by four spaces your code will be formatted as code. It is hard to read right now.
I'm going to ~~anoy~~ help you learn some more with hints in the form of questions. what do you do to make this code run?
Don't bother. I will figure it out by myself! Thanks for your time!
In other words, the issue is not in the function... look the piece of code that calls the function, the issue is after calling the function.
If you put a variable on a new line without a semi-colon, what happens? It prints what value that variable has, right? Now if you combined that with my previous comment, where does that get you? (I'm trying to help you figure it out along the way with hints rather than just giving it to you. I've found that I remember best that way and am trying to give you that same benefit, not trying to be obnoxious about it.)
Thanks for your reply, but If I call it from command window with `isItSquared(a);` the "ans" turns into a "b" and then I have 4x b, what doesn't correlate with the 3 values in "a".
Are you sure? That's not what I see. I just see three `b` values 
I'm sorry, my mistake. After clearing the workspace it did work. If I remove the `b=...` after `Function` it would also work. Would that be a recommended workaround from within the Function? &amp;#x200B;
The coefficient matrix PCA returns should be 954x954. Can you post your code?
It depends on your intention when calling the function, if you want to assign the result of variable b or not.
Are you linking the model to a data dictionary? That could be the issue. [From our Doc] (https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/release-notes.html?s_cid=doc_ftr) Look under "Data Management" -&gt; "Enable model to access data directly from base workspace and data dictionary " "Before R2019a, a model could have direct access to the base workspace or a data dictionary. In R2019a, this limitation no longer exists. A new model still has access to the base workspace by default, but does not automatically lose access when it is linked to a data dictionary. If you have code that is based on the assumption that the model has access to either the base workspace or a data dictionary, this code must be modified to account for models with access to both. Other model configuration issues to consider with this change: For models created in previous releases, Enable access to base workspace is selected only if the model is not currently linked to a data dictionary. You cannot set Data Dictionary to ' ' unless you select Enable access to base workspace ." 
I think by Transposing it I've got it to work. (At least it produced a matrix of that size) trainingLabel{featureCount} = int2str(person); trainingFeatures(featureCount,:) = extractHOGFeatures(MaskedRot,'CellSize',HOGcellsize); % ^ How the matrix of features is set up. 954 (row) x1764 (col) ... T = transpose(trainingFeatures); [coeff,score,latent,tsquared,explained,mu] = pca(T); %I then want to pass to classifier palmClassifier = fitcecoc(trainingFeatures, trainingLabel) Do I need to transpose it back before creating the classifier?
Nah that should be it. You can transpose a matrix using ' (i.e. pca(trainingFeatures');)
I, for one, thought you were doing a good job. Props to you, dude
Thanks! Do you know how I would apply this to new data? Ie I have the features for one image (1x1764) and I want to reduce it to 1x954 to use the ***predict*** function. I was looking on the website [here](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/stats/pca.html#mw_259c3eec-4b87-4fa7-841c-69bae48cc504) and I think I'm doing what it suggests, however I'm getting a 1764x954 matrix now. I'm using all columns of coeff currently rather than calculating how many it needs for 95% of the representation. queryFeatures = extractHOGFeatures(MaskedRot,'CellSize',HOGcellsize); queryFeatures = (queryFeatures'-mu)*coeff(:,:); &amp;#x200B;
Thanks :), i appreciate that
If you use all of the columns, you'll just get back a perfect reconstruction. All the coeffs do is a change of basis into a coordinate system where most of the variance of the data is along the 'principle axes'. &amp;#x200B;
Ah yeah I understand what you mean, so I need to work out for the 95%. But how do I apply this to the new data for 1 image before using the predict function? (ie reduce it's feature vector from 1x1764 the size needed) &amp;#x200B;
I sometimes use [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)) in my research, it can be used on images.
I'm sorry I made a dumb mistake. You actually want coeff to be 1764x1764, so the matrix you call pca on should be 954x1764. Then you figure out `idx`, the # of principle components to keep to retain 95% of variance in your data. Then you can project an image into the lower dimensional space like this: z = coeff(:, 1:idx); smallimg = img \* z; z is 1764 by idx, since it's a transformation matrix to change basis from the 1764 pixels to the idx principle components. Note that img there can be a single vectorized image (1x1764) or a collection of N images (Nx1764), it will still work out and project all of them.
The reason your result from PCA is 1764x953 instead of 1764x1764 is because you have fewer data points than you do dimensions, which means that your covariance matrix is degenerate. In other words, you have redundant information and you don't need 1764 dimensions to represent your data--you need 953. If you want the full 1764x1764 matrix, you can call pca with `econ` turned off, as in: &gt;&gt; coeff = pca(X,'econ',false); For more of a description: when you perform PCA on your 954 points, you only need 954 dimensions to represent them compactly. The result is that the values in the remaining dimensions 954...1764 all have value 0 for each point. Imagine that you have two 3D points located at (x1,y1,0) and (x2,y2,0). PCA will project these onto the 2-dimensional XY plane; the 3rd dimension isn't necessary. By default, `pca` leaves out these extranneous dimensions.
I think this is achieving what I set out to do (produced a 93% accuracy with predict on 320 tests). However the sizes are confusing me. coeff is 1764x953, score is 954x953. Not sure why I have lost an observation? Score95 is 954x183 which makes sense to me I think? How I interpret this is that it takes 183 of the variables to retain 95% variance, so this is the reduced down version of the original features vector? [coeff,score,latent,tsquared,explained,mu] = pca(trainingFeatures); sum_explained = 0; idx = 0; while sum_explained &lt; 95 idx = idx + 1; sum_explained = sum_explained + explained(idx); end score95 = score(:,1:idx); %%Create Classifier palmClassifier = fitcecoc(score95, trainingLabel); Then with the predict call queryFeatures = extractHOGFeatures(MaskedRot,'CellSize',HOGcellsize); queryFeatures = (queryFeatures-mu)*coeff(:,1:idx); [palmLabel,NegLoss, PBScore] = predict(palmClassifier, queryFeatures); &amp;#x200B;
Thank you, that makes sense! I think I've achieved what I set out to do now!
Since this seems to be confusing you a bit, here's an explanation... When you call a function that has a return value, that value usually gets assigned to something else: &gt;&gt; x = func(); `x` now equals whatever value `func` produced. If you leave out the semicolon, Matlab will print the value of `x` to the screen: &gt;&gt; x = func() x = ... If you don't assign the output of `func` to anything, Matlab by default creates the variable `ans` and assigns the result to that: &gt;&gt; func() ans = ... Even if you terminate it with a semicolon, you'll still get the value placed into `ans`. It just doesn't get printed out to the screen, because of the semicolon.
Could you explain more about what exactly you are trying to achieve? Are you looking for image quality metrics like ssim/psnr/etc? There are a bunch of them in the Image Processing Toolbox.
Something weird is going on there. If trainingFeatures is 954x1754 (the rows correspond to different images, cols are pixel values), coeff should be 1754x1754 and score should be 954x1754. coeffs has to be square, and score has to be the same size as trainingFeatures. You're checking matrix sizes by calling size(), and not overwriting the variables later, right? The code all looks good though, and your interpretation is right. PCA managed to find a representation of the data where most of the variability is on 183 axes, allowing you to throw out a lot of information that doesn't tell you much. Re: the missing sample. Are you certain that all of the images were valid? PCA may have come across a NaN or something and thrown it out.
No, I'm already using PSNR and mssim to compare the quality of the output denoise image. What I want exactly is to modify the "group by block matching step" [here](https://imgur.com/a/ArF16EY), where the authors are using SSD. I suppose there must be other ways to do this than SSD. 
Are you using [HDL Verifier](https://www.mathworks.com/products/hdl-verifier.html) to cosimulate?
Try isempty(n)
To test if something (such as your 'n') is empty, you have to use the isempty function. Simply replace the third line above with: if isempty(n)
tyyyy love u guys
If you have problem with a new version of a software (any software)) that you didn’t had before, you should take a look at the release notes. In the MATLAB /Simulink case, you can even filter to only display the compatibility changes. [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/release-notes.html?rntext=&amp;startrelease=R2016a&amp;endrelease=R2019a&amp;rntype=incompatibility&amp;groupby=release&amp;sortby=descending&amp;searchHighlight=) is the direct link. In this case: &gt; Return simulation outputs as a single simulation output by default for new Simulink models For simulation of new Simulink models, the output is returned as a single output object, Simulink.SimulationOutput. The Simulink.SimulationOutput object encapsulates all the resulting enabled simulation data (signal, state, output, data store logging, toworkspace block logging, and scope). To follow the same behavior while simulating with the sim command, ReturnWorkspaceOutputs is set to On by default. Compatibility Considerations For Simulink models built in previous releases, ReturnWorkspaceOutputs argument remains off. Set the ReturnWorkspaceOutputs argument to on to return the simulation result as a single output object.
Is there a reason you want to implement non local means yourself? It’s in the IPT in the last year or two.
So trainingFeatures isn't changed after the PCA and is 954x1764. coeff is 1764x953, score is 954x953. All sizes taken from the workspace or hovering over the variable. &amp;#x200B; I checked and there's no NaN in trainingFeatures. I think the other comment explains the sizes unless I'm wrong? I'm not fully sure I have a missing sample, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the variable sizes? Thanks! &amp;#x200B;
Sorry to confuse you again, I edited my comment a little bit ago. The other comment is right, and you should be all set

um i am not sure if ur being real or sarcastic either way i need help
Are you asking to blind the domain of the function or to find all the roots in a given range? Note that fsolve only finds a single root. If an equation has multiple roots, fsolve will only find one of them and which one is due to the initial condition. 
Yes.
Three sigma is three standard deviations about the mean. If your distribution is gaussian normal it should give you a 99.7% case scenario... Definitely not a Matlab question.
Maybe we can turn it into a matlab question: How can I calculate the mean and determine the range where 99.9% of my values are expected to fall (3.5 sigma)? &amp;#x200B; Great question! I'd find the average value of the data using matlab's mean function. Then calculate the standard deviation using matlab's std function and determine the 3.5 sigma range. Like this: &amp;#x200B; % assume data already imported to variable d...but we'll generate some for this d = randn(10000, 1)\*4 + 37 x\_bar = mean(d); sigma = std(d); lower\_3\_5\_sigma = x\_bar - 3.5\*sigma; upper\_3\_5\_sigma = x\_bar + 3.5\*sigma;
I didn't go that far because we haven't even heard if OP's dataset is gaussian normal. Also, while I like helping, I find people learn better when they've at least tried to do it themselves. Finally, OP never explicitly asked for help in matlab - they asked a stats problem. I don't disagree with your solution, I just wouldn't have posted it until I received more feedback from OP.
Very true on all points. Just felt like doing a little matlab. It's been all python and go for me lately (yuck). Also, ran it with d = rand(n,1) before making the post and the results really didn't make sense...def going to want some data that is close to Gaussian
Its not perfectly gaussian... this is real data, and its more Poisson I believe.
You are very kind. Thank you for responding! Its not perfectly gaussian... this is real data, and its more Poisson I believe. It's like a guassian except skewed to one side. So the question is: is 3 x RMS an accurate representation or the 99.9% case? When you only have 10,000 samples it's hard to trust the 99.9 percent case. This is exactly what I said the person above, but maybe you have a different take.
the whole "3 sigma" thing is true for the Normal distribution because of the underlying Probability Density Function of the Normal. It is not guaranteed to hold up for other distributions. There is something called the Chebyshev Inequality which is more appropriate: &amp;#x200B; [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev%27s\_inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev%27s_inequality) &amp;#x200B; if you're trying to get an idea for your situation, you have two options: &amp;#x200B; 1) fit a distribution to your data (look up Chi-Square Goodness of Fit tests as a starting point), then find a 99.9% interval from the fitted PDF to get your range. &amp;#x200B; 2) use your example data directly to estimate the range. This would work if you have "a lot" of data, but isn't very good if you don't.
to add another perspective, the "sum of squared differences" shows up quite a bit due to the "best fit" for the Normal Equations: &amp;#x200B; [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalEquation.html](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalEquation.html) &amp;#x200B; This is the basis for Multiple Linear Regressions and is one of those concepts in math that pops up over and over again.
If ı write a range instead of initial condition Can ı find All of the roots on given range . Or how can i find the all roots 
There are examples in MathWorks documentation that can help you. Try searching for "import text" or "import data."
&gt; documentation ok. thanks you think i need to use fopen() to open file fgetl() to extract the values of file or load() which one is better?? 
Import the data into Matlab using the GUI and ask Matlab to "generate code" of the event. It will generate a code that does the importing and sorting into columns/cells using a tab or space delimited approach (like in Excel). From there, modify the code as necessary, i.e. clean it up.
xt and yt are points, they need to be vectors. Store all of the data you plan to plot, not just the final point
so that will be where i need to create a loop?
Not necessarily, if t is a vector, you will make x and y a vector when you multiply by t
how do i know if t is a vector or not?
Well right now it's not. Look at how you set it: &gt; t1 = (v0*sind(theta))/g; %working out the time to max height where vertical velocity = 0 &gt; t2 = sqrt(2*maxheight/g); %time to hit the ground from max height &gt; t = t1 + t2; %total flight time Both of those variables (t1, t2) are constant. You can verify this by checking the workspace.
that calculates the flight time. so would i need to create a different time vector for the coordinates of the projectile?
Yes, then tmax is going to be t.
so i should probably change t to tmax then create a vector for t for the location of the projectile with respect to time?
 tmax = t1+t2 t = 1:tmax You could try that. Like I said, I haven't looked too closely at the whole kinematics portion of your problem, but I'd imagine that'd give you somethnig closer to what you're looking for.
i think that is definitely on the right track, but because my yt = y0 + vy\*t-0.5\*g\*t\^2 has the t squared it through up an issue. I tried changing it to t\*t but that didnt fix the problem. Error using \^ Incorrect dimensions for raising a matrix to a power. Check that the matrix is square and the power is a scalar. To perform elementwise matrix powers, use '.\^'. &amp;#x200B; Error in matlabs\_engineering\_academy\_assignment\_2019\_q2 (line 29) yt = y0 + vy\*t-0.5\*g\*t\^2; %points in time of the projectile

ok one final question. I have to plot it for 3 different angles. can i create a loop for that? can i just stick in a for theta = 15 v0 = 150 theta = 45 v0 = 150 theta = 60 v0 = 150 end
fopen and fgetl are options. Don't use load() - that's for .mat or ASCII files. See reply from **ExtendedDeadline**. 
I recommend [contacting MathWorks Support](https://www.mathworks.com/support/contact_us.html?s_tid=sp_ban_cs). Some one should be able to help you - I'd be pleasantly surprised if someone here had a good answer.
That's not how for loops work. What you could do is something like: theta = [15; 45; 60];]
i tried that, that was my first idea but it went a bit mental. maybe because i did theta = [15 45 60] rather than what you have done. im just going to repeat the code two more times and use hold on to put them all on the one graph and change all the variables to 1, 2 and 3s. I know thats not really the best way to do it but ive started now.
Lol, "not the best way to do it" is what I do most of the time. As long as you get the job done, you're good to go (unless you're dealing with something that needs to be super efficient, which your code does not need to be.) 
Nice! Yeah, you need to use '.' for elementwise multiplication
Thanks for the answer. I don't want to implement it myself, I want to modify it a bit, by using a different weighting function, and also change the search window shape, etc... Btu actually, in the photo is the first step of the BM3D algorithm, implemented and shared by Dabov et al, and I want to also modify here the step of "grouping by bm". So, the BM3D is a further development of the NLM, and then other versions of it appeared, BM4D, V-BM3D... Regards
Ah, it says NLM in the figure title. But cool, have fun.
yes, sorry about that. I'm working on implementing and modifying the NLM denoising technique in Matlab, but in the same time researching some future modifications for BM3D, that's why I mixed them. 
Can you post the plot?
In general no. I actually just had to deal with this in the context of finding roots of a characteristic equation of Bessel functions. Finding successive roots of a non-linear function is not trivial and I could not find a simple built in way to do it. It is especially difficult if your function has multiple arguments.
Yes it is. If you'd like a better answer I'd read our rules for submitting homework questions, especially the part about showing what you've tried and where you're stuck. 
First of all, thank You for the answer. I have a velocity of molar flow depending on the mass of the catalyst along the tube reactor and it is necessary to obtain the optimized values of the kinetic parameters k0, Ea, A, and B. The value of T (temperature) along the reactor tube is also known. My knowledge of Matlab is very weak and I have a problem with determining the specified optimized values of the kinetic parameters. Do you need further explanations? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
I added a link to some sample plots. They should be viewable now.
Can you share your code? If you're plotting 3D normal data points you should be getting a point cloud. I think the relationship you're seeing is because of what "surf" is doing.
Read the documentation on for loops
You can use [interp2](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/interp2.html). There are options for 'linear', 'nearest', 'cubic', 'makima', or 'spline' interpolation.
Thnx
You can use the [Curve fitting toolbox with a custom nonlinear model](https://www.mathworks.com/help/curvefit/custom-nonlinear-models.html).
`surf` is what you want. If you're getting errors it's because you aren't provided it the proper inputs.
Just added the script to the body text. I believe the surf command is connecting each randomized point - that would explain the clean edges. However, it seems each point is connected to other specific points to form these 2D figures. 
It looks to me like you are just modelling the effects of gravity rather than any drag etc. I would have thought in that case you need to: Define angle to either the vertical or horizontal. Define initial velocity Then if you define a time base like t=0:0.01:10; You can then use the equations of motion for each time step. Firstly seperate out the X and Y components of velocity. Then use the gravitational acceleration on the y component. Using the equation of motion. V = U + a*t; as your time base is a vector you will get a load of changing velocities. As you have not conaidered any drag the x direction velocity will remain constant. 
Thank you!! That's really helpful! 
On mobile now, so won't be able to go into too much detail, but this is due to "surf". If you look at the documentation you'll see that your x and y inputs should be making a grid of some sort, and the z gives the height at each of those points. The jagged nature is probably occuring because your x and y aren't sorted as surf expects it to be. You probably want to look at plot3 instead. (Also, you can just do rand(10,1) to create a 10x1 vector)
Why are you taking mass as a vector? Masses are not vector quantities to my understanding...
Don't have the Arduino package so not sure what latencies readvoltage might have, but you might be able to speed this up if you do the reading in C in the Arduino IDE and communicate it to MATLAB by serial communication instead of using the readvoltage command.
Honestly I found Matlab to be a pain in the rear for stuff like this. There are better, free visualization software options. I used Matlab to obtain the values and coordinates and Visit (visit.llnl.gov) to plot the results. The VTK database for Visit is plain text and simple to write in Matlab
I think he just means an array of mass values. Which to matlab is equivalent to a vector
`str2num()` returns two values, the second tells you if the conversion to a number was successful. That saves you from having to explicitly check for an empty result. [https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/str2num.html](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/str2num.html): &gt;\[X,tf\] = str2num(chr) additionally returns a second output argument that is 1 (true) if str2num successfully converts chr. Otherwise, str2num returns 0 (false).
You just need to add square brackets around the text to concatenate a text. Currently, your right hand side is a 1x2 cell array rather than a single piece of text. for i=1:20 cord(i,1) = {['id_' num2str(i)]} end If you can use the new string datatype in your workflow, you could just do: "id_" + (1:20)'
Thanks a lot! Your help was really useful :D
Okay, I'll give it a try using the plot3 command. Thanks for the info!
If you just want to plot, I would use surf, contour plot.. One line of code.. 
Took a quick look, a few thoughts... &gt; function \[e,m\] = energy ( ) why are you using the 'input' call instead of just inputting m values into the function, also why are you returning m, which is a user input that is unchanged in the function? &gt;clc &gt; &gt;close all Other people may not agree, but I think it's a terrible habit to have statements like this in a function &gt; Case = input('Enter Y for yes or N for No=','s'); Use *switch* &gt; e = 'NA'; here you're writing a string to something that would typically store numbers, makes more sense to have *e = NaN;* or *e = -999;* &gt; min(m)&lt;0 code like this can be confusing and prone to error, just use something like any(m&lt;0) &gt; if (Case=='Y')||(Case=='y') things like this are replaceable by *lower(Case) == 'y';* also I don't see why the case should ONLY run for multiple inputs... also if the input is not acceptable (i.e. negative) you should exit the function - as it is right now, it will ask whether or not you want a plot, but e is a string and attempting to plot will produce an error...
There’s a function called “compose” that you might be interested it.
Thanks for your reply
You’re welcome. The way I did root finding was to discretize the domain and then check for zero crossings and narrow in from there. It requires knowing something about how close your roots are (to guide how fine the discretization is) and would only work for a 1D problem as mine is. 
If the data from fscanf is just a number you can change the format so it reads a number which you can add to an array. See [the fscanf ](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/serial.fscanf.html) and [the sscanf ](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/sscanf.html?s_tid=doc_ta#bvjmcrm_sep_shared-formatSpec) for how to format your format string
Were you performing eigenvalue analysis on those sized matrices? Matlab must not like you much.
You can use cell arrays to have columns of different lengths
Your are so using a BI section algorithm. Badicslly
Not sure how smoothing data will improve anything in term of air/fuel ratio, power, knock.. Considering the variation of the physics in the engine and the relatively low density of points, I m very doubt full. 
Yes I am, but I figured using such high level terminology wouldn’t be helpful for OP
| Is that because the xt1 and yt1 are vectors? Correct! | Is that because the xt1 and yt1 are vectors? is there a way to solve that without drastically changing all the programming that has gone before? Man, you're gonna be flabergasted. There is a &amp; operator which works on arrays. But you still need to use another 3 lettered function (which i leave as an excersize for the reader to find) that checks all values in a logical array. Do you still need the &amp; operator? and can you do without? if so which approach is better? | Also is there a way to work in a margin for error so that the intersection point can be close enough to count as a "hit"? This is also quite straight forward. Try to make a formula that calculates distances between points (pythagoras much?), and use a comparison operator.
so i couldnt figure out what you were hinting at, so what i decided to do was to work out the point of impact as a scalar then compare the two scalars. ive got intersection = \[725 50\] and shotfired = \[725.000 50.000\] then said if shotfired == intersection disp('BULLSEY!!! The Space Aliens are all Dead!') disp('Are you ready to move planets? ') else disp('You missed! The Space Aliens are mocking you! Fire again!') end &amp;#x200B; but it is still displaying You missed! The Space Aliens are mocking you! Fire again! is that because the shotfired has decimal points in it?
yeah it was the rounding. god damn you matlabs!!!
It is (also shotfired == intersection is still an array, which you do not want for an if) . And the only way to fix this is by implementing a margin of error. This is always the case when working with floating point ('with a decimal') numbers, because round of errors you get at the 7th place behind the decimal matter when you use ==. Try to run this: \`0.15+0.15 == 0.2 + 0.1\` . What you want is how for the intersection point is from the shotfired. Image the 2d carthesian plane with two points. How would you calculate the distance between the two points given their x and y coordinates? 
i want the x-coordinate to be +-1 15. the y-coorinate should always be accurate because of the time of flight calculate ive done. So then really do i need it in the code? xfinal = x0 + vx1\*tmax1; %x-coordinate of final position yfinal = y0 + vy1\*tmax1-0.5\*g\*tmax1\^2; %y-coordinate of final position xland = round(xfinal); yland = round(yfinal); shotfired = \[xland yland\] &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; if shotfired == intersection disp('BULLSEY!!! The Space Aliens are all Dead!') disp('Are you ready to move planets? ') else disp('You missed! The Space Aliens are mocking you! Fire again!') end &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; could i just remove the yland and then just have xland? i dont understand this - Try to run this: \`0.15+0.15 == 0.2 + 0.1\` is that the full line?
| could i just remove the yland and then just have xland? Ofcourse you could, but you will be calculating a different thing. If you only compare to xland, you will check how far from the target you land on the ground. If you use both xland and yland and the whole trajectory, you calculate how close to the target you'll get. Decide what you want and do that. &amp;#x200B; In any case, don't use round to 'solve' floating point comparison errors. For three reasons in this case: (1) it hinges on the fact that intersection uis an integer which is not always the case (2) It impliclty defines a 0.5 margin of error which you want to (3) There is a better way. Look at the difference ([abs](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/abs.html) [-](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/minus.html)) and compare ([&lt;](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/lt.html)) that to the target value. &amp;#x200B; |is that the full line? It is a full line, It's obviously a true statement but results might be surprising if you dont take into account floating point precision errors. Paste it in the matlab console and see what is up 
this is what i've done. seems to work. xfinal = x0 + vx1\*tmax1; %x-coordinate of final position xland = round(xfinal); %x-coordinate of landing point rounded &amp;#x200B; ximin = xi - xi\*0.025; %minimum margin of error 2.5% ximax = xi + xi\*0.025; %maximum margin of error 2.5% &amp;#x200B; if xland &gt;= ximin &amp;&amp; xland &lt;= ximax disp('BULLSEY!!! The Space Aliens are all Dead!') disp('Are you ready to move planets? ') else disp('You missed! The Space Aliens are mocking you! Fire again!') end
Now you're implementing a fractional margini of error. Do you want that? how far can you be off you you shoot at xi = 100.000? and how far off can you be if you aim at xi = 1? does that make sense?
yeah, i think that should be ok. I can make the maps of the right size so that my margin of error is appropriate. i can also adjust that for future levels.
wrong answer :P. Your solution works, but that is not the only thing to keep in mind when you're programming. Its at least as important for stuff to work sensibly. You're implementing a dependency of the shot precision based on the size of the world, which does not make sense and is unnecesairy. Stuff like this will confuse other people who read your code, or yourself if you'de continue working on it a couple months in the future. It's best to never teach yourself poor coding practices, then you don't have to unlearn them, which can be hard. &amp;#x200B; If you just remove the second xi from the ximin lines you'll be fine. e.g.: `ximin = xi - 1` &amp;#x200B; There's a better way (because you dont write 0.025 twice, code duplication should be avoided, and this method is still easily readable code) to do it than with implementing ximin and ximax seperately. What does this calculate?: `abs(xland - xi)` 
is there a way to get matlab to run the program again but from a specific point?
Several depending on the circumstance. In scripts, i use f9 a lot to run the selected lines. in functions you'd need to combine that with the debugger ( [https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab\_prog/debugging-process-and-features.html](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/debugging-process-and-features.html) ) in order to get the right variables in the workspace
i was meaning to loop the programme from a certain point while it is running. my understand of loops is not good. i really struggle with adding in loop variables and stuff. it melts my brain.
but i dont want to have xi - 1. i want to have it as a percentage less? rather than a specific value.

Looks like you could also use the bvp4c built in function as a check/verification for the boundary value problem.

If the lines are determined by equations then simply solve for which X they have the same value for both lines equations. You might get multiple solutions for that so additional conditions should be added, like minimum and maximum distance or time. 
Two functions intersect at the point(s) where their difference is zero. You could use fzero for that. If these are not equation defined you can use an interpolator. 
I grabbed a thinkpad P1 a little while ago. I would definitely recommend. The 2/1 is a little pricey though. 
Hey, I don’t really understand what your question is... But I did similar things recently and I think I could help. PM me if you want.
I don’t know if this is really related to your question but its a good thing to know: you can use the “import” button on the toolbar to open an excel file, choose the data you want to read, and import it into MATLAB. The nice thing is you *then* have the option to generate a code that will repeat what you did. 
So what shape and data type are DMP and TMP?
N = 4; a =[]; for n = 1:N a = [a n*ones(1,N-1)]; end b=reshape(a,N,N-1); c=flipud(b) Does that give you what you want?
 [X,Y] = meshgrid(1:N); Y(X~=Y);
Close. I tried your pre-edit one too. The problem is the result is a column vector not a matrix.

Could OP still use Matlab in a web browser? I've used Matlab Online for some simple things on a Windows computer, but I don't know if it would work on an ARM device, or what the limitations of Matlab Online are.
Away from my computer so this is a complete guess: `A = ones(4)*transpose(1:4)` ( i.e. A = [1,2,3,4; 1,2,3,4; 1,2,3,4; 1,2,3,4] ) `B = ~logical(eye(4))` ( i.e. B = [0,1,1,1; 1,0,1,1; 1,1,0,1; 1,1,1,0] ) `C = A.*B` `C(C==0) = []` I don't know if that last line will generate an error though
No.
Nope. Buy it; if you're a student (and I don't know why you'd want it and not have it provided if you're not a student) it's pretty reasonable for software like this.

Whoups, on my computer the matrix you posted appeared as a vector. I don’t know why. You’re just one reshape function away from your matrix. The other post in the thread has it. I just thought that my way of generating the numbers was cleaner. 
Yeah its much cleaner! Thanks!
Don’t ask me why it’s working or how I manage to write this line, but this seems to work: N = 10; a = flipud(reshape(ones(N-1,1)*(1:N),N,[])) That’s not easy to read, so don’t use it, or explain clearly in a comment what this is doing.

/u/EatMyPossum has been giving some good advice. Try their ideas about Pythagoras and &lt; operator. `Absolute_distance = (yt1, xt1) - (xi, yi)` You can use Pythagoras with that to get an absolute distance between the two. Then, use `&lt;` to identify if the difference is less than your tolerance.

Thank You. Can you explain to me how this task can be done in matlab. d(t)/d(xa) = Na0 / ((-ra) \* V) Na0 = 5 ra = -k \* Ca \^ 2 V = V0 \* (1 + eps \* xa) k = 0.023 Ca = Ca0 \* (1 - xa) / (1 + eps \* xa) Ca0 = Na0 / V0 eps = 1 V0 = 10 t(0) = 0 xa(0) = 0 xa(f) = 0.75 This is copied from polymath and it's clear to me. I would ask for the code in the matlab of this example. Thanks a lot
What have you tried? 
What you mean?
i think ive got myself into a bit of trouble with the way ive made the equation of the ground line. Ive used this x1 = 0; y1 = 50; %ground level x2 = 1000; y2 = 200; %ground level x3 = 600; %x distance to target y3 = 139; x4 = 600; %x distance to target y4 = 141; &amp;#x200B; then used MatrixA = \[x1 x2 x3; y1 y2 y3; 1 1 1\]; MatrixB = \[x1 x2 x4; y1 y2 y4; 1 1 1\]; MatrixC = \[x1 x3 x4; y1 y3 y4; 1 1 1\]; MatrixD = \[x2 x3 x4; y2 y3 y4; 1 1 1\]; &amp;#x200B; if det(MatrixA)\*det(MatrixB) &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; det(MatrixC)\*det(MatrixD) &lt; 0 xi = ((x4-x3)\*(x2\*y1-x1\*y2)+(x2-x1)\*(x3\*y4-x4\*y3))/((x2-x1)\*(y4-y3)-(x4-x3)\*(y2-y1)); yi = ((y4-y3)\*(x2\*y1-x1\*y2)+(y2-y1)\*(x3\*y4-x4\*y3))/((x2-x1)\*(y4-y3)-(x4-x3)\*(y2-y1)); intersection = \[xi yi\]; &amp;#x200B; to get my "target" to aim at. That works fine, but in my second level i have made the ground a sloping line. but because ive used time of flight to calculate the x position where it lands, it thinks the ground is still at y1 = 50 so gives me a hit when its not a hit. i can do a bit of Pythagoras to fix that, but i dont know if that will fix it if i had the ground as a sine wave or something like that. 
I mean what have you already tried? Surely you tried on your own, and don't expect us to just do your work for you? 
I believe there are algorithms for generating random numbers from any arbitrary distribution. I assume there is a function in the statistics toolkit that implements this. If not, you'll need to find an algorithm that works for your particular distribution, or implement one that works in general (e.g. Metropolis-Hastings or some Markov chain tricks).
 R = mvnrnd(mu,sigma,n) Will generate samples from a gaussian distribution. Not sure if this will help. 
to get some idea i am using normrnd() function, but many a time error occur as stated in the text of this thread. Is my custom function wrong or what please follow the wikipedia link in the text above.
I would do a change of variable in t to 'normalize' the time constant to one. Basically perform t2=t/1000 and rewrite the dynamics using t2. This may improve the numerical conditioning a bit. 
1. One single plot with both time series. So you'll have to use the plot function multiple times. MATLAB makes a new figure every time you plot values, so use "hold on" to plot multiple series' on one plot. 2. No clue 3. Total duration is T, which is a value of 500 (seconds maybe?). 50 realizations in that domain means a step size of 10. So for each series, you'll have 50 unique datapoints. 4. You're welcome &amp;#x200B;
Gotta be honest I was gonna suggest a way higher initialstep value for odeset but...you have 100 orders of magnitude spanning your Km, unless I am totally misunderstanding your issue, this is not a trivial exercise to solve. Basically even if you could get time evolution of your OP example (you likely hit machine accuracy and simulate noise anyway even if you do optimal normalization), you aren't actually gonna be able to reproduce experiment because all but your large rate coefficients are going to mean your smaller ones may as well be 0. 10-20, maybe 30 orders of magnitude is a challenge...100? errr... has this been done?
I like this solution. Not a Matlab solution, but a good one.
Sorry, missed that. Does your function indeed return non-positive values? That's obviously not kosher for a probability distribution. You should check the behavior of your function for a few thousand points across it's domain. 
Your first try should be to scale your equations but scanning your code makes it look like that isn't an option. I may try scaling so dy is reasonable (say, dy=1) and solving for a small duration. Then, rescale again so dy=1 and solve for a small duration. Continue until you solve for the end time.
Actually I forgot the zero rows. You can use kron and [0;1].

Most likely you don't want to be using syms, but rather a system solver like lsqnonlin
Thanks! I'm new to Matlab and not really aware of what tools I have available
You don't want to use symbols for a numerical problem (or ever, really) so vpa() and digits() have no relevance here. The traditional solution to this problem is to scale your equations into a different system of units (possibly non-traditional units) where the values in question are all near unity. 
I've been using MATLAB for about 15 years and I've never had a legitimate usage for syms. Sometimes I think I need it, but then realize there's a more elegant engineering approach. Good luck.
I wish I could upvote this twice. 
I'm just trying to solve transfer functions in terms of certain variables for now. The elegant solutions can wait until I get my bearings haha
Yeah it's definitely a normal random variable
If you want to record accelerometer data on the go, I've had good luck with the Physics Toolbox Suite app, which also lets you record gyro and other sensors your phone has.
the function returned positive values, if i consider the vector that i have stated above, the pdf function produces positive values, you can check if you want, just by stripping of the custom details in the pdf given above and putting lets say a=0.2, b=0.2 and using x (given above). the output is a positive vector. now if i do mle with lets say with same a=0.2 , b=0.2 and x it produces error.
Is it possible to reconsider how you model this problem? Replace whatever influence these small values represent with a simpler model. Or neglect. 
[This section](https://www.mathworks.com/help/pde/examples/contour-slices-through-a-3-d-solution.html) might help you. I played with your code and tried to drop it in, but I'm getting stuck on the interpolateSolution command. I have the PDE Toolbox as well and apparently I have the interpolateSolution function too, but it's having trouble knowing which one to call? [This question](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/329899-toolbox-problems-some-functions-missing) is the only place I can see this error referenced. I'm not sure what to do with that information though. How do I call the interpolateSolution function and tell it which one to use?
I tried doing as suggested and it didn't work. I would appreciate any advice: &amp;#x200B; disp('Would you like to see the graph') Case = input('Enter Y for yes or N for No=','s'); switch Case case 1 lower(Case)='y'; %Linear plot ... case 2 lower(Case)='n'; disp('Thank you for using this function') end &amp;#x200B;
cases aren't numeric they are cell strings, refer to the documentation for example 
Did you also look at BVP solver:bvp4c or bvp5c as well as bvpsuite (you should google for that one). You can solve classical Cauchy pb (i.e ode integration using them). The good thing is that they use collocation and therefore do not experience the same numerical issue that classical explicit integration scheme...

A seance might work better 😉
Thanks again for the explanation 
Your code only prints a and b because you didn't terminate them with ; Some pointers: Your for loop isn't actually a loop. You're setting a single value for c. So this never enters your if condition. To do a matrix multiplication you need them to be the same dimensions. The logic of your code does not do what you want. If you want to test the sum of squares for each a and each b, you need a nested for loop where you go for a = 1:1:120 and within that for loop a for b =1:1:150
Step through the code yourself and spend some effort learning what it is doing. Its absolutely absurd to take a code snippet like this and ask others to figure out what its doing and explain it to you. Stop being lazy and do the work. 
Thank you for the feedback, I really appreciate it. I have updated my code accordingly. I am hoping now that C enters my if condition. However, the 'dis' function does not seem to write. Am I using the correct function for my application? Or am I missing another function? str='a=%4i b=%4i c=%4i'; for c=1:1:100; for a=1:1:100; for b=1:1:100; if c==sqrt(a.^2+b.^2) dis(sprintf(str,a,b,c)) end end end end commandwindow 
I don’t know what the dis command does. You are probably looking for the disp command, with a p.
Maybe you could use 'mod' in some way. All the hardcoding in your code is making my head hurt.
Just save the file a new name that ends in .dxf instead of .txt. Then it will be a dxf file. It might not be formatted properly for a dxf, and it might not work with code designed to read valid dxf, but that's about the best I can manage since you've told us nothing about what a dxf file is supposed to look like, or what you've already tried. 
I'd put it into a nested function called makematrix or something
Afraid I've tried that already. I have also tried importing the txt file on to Autocad and importing the file there to convert it alas that did not work. To start with i have a txt file which has 3 columns representing x y z. I want to convert the file to a dxf file. I thought it would be as you say, just import then save as a .dxf. I don't have the option though. Thanks and apologies for lack of info
If your data is in datetime format consider [posixtime.](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/datetime.posixtime.html) You can then convert the epoch to time in hours which have passed.
So two things might help. (1) Bring “No(i)” outside of the “j” for-loop (2) Set “N=[]” before the “j” for-loop
 No = zeros(no-1,1) N = zeros(1,no) for i = 1:no-1 for j = i+1:no N(j) = abs(t(i)-t(j)) &lt; tau; end No(i) = sum(N) end Still having the same problem
Do you have access to solidworks? I’m pretty sure you could do it in there
Set “N=[]” in the “i” loop but before the “j” loop. Also, you can try replacing the whole double for loop with: “No = sum( triu(abs(t-t.’)&lt;tau) , 2 )” or for earlier versions of MATLAB: “No = sum( triu(abs(bsxfun(@minus,t,t.’))&lt;tau) , 2 )” or
The problem you are having has to do with the fact that every time your i loops, de N vector is already fill. Which will result in this case in No = [9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9] You can simply solve this, if you write "N = zeros(1,no-1)" before your j loop starts, so between your 2 loops. 
Hero, having N in the "i" loop worked. I'm unsure why this is the case though, as I would've thought having it set before would be enough. Thank you for your help
Thank you for your help, I understand now. Cheers
Glad I could help!
You don't need the c loop I'd do it as: For a = 1:1:120 For b = 1:1:150 c = sqrt(a^2+b^2); If c==137 % or whatever value you're looking for Sprintf(str,a,b,c) End End End You don't need disp if you sprintf
I'll try this now
Worked! Thank you!

Hi, Thanks for taking the time out to point that out. I have no issues with trying my hand at learning the language, but apart from SQL I have zero programming knowledge/experience, also the reason I asked for help here was that I have to submit this by next weekend so I am constrained by time. Also if I can't then I will have to repeat a semester. 
Anychance you know how to join the points on solidworks? Kind of like a massive dot to dot currently
You can use the [Timeseries](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/time-series-objects.html) object to store the data and then create plots for them that will have the proper spacing on the x-axis. One thing to note is this method assumes you have no gaps in the data (if you do actually have gaps, the plot will show a line connecting the points on either side of the gap). I actually wrote a custom plotting function a while ago that handled gaps (along with some other methods to add single points and a vertical line to the plots, available here: [https://github.com/imciner2/MATLAB\_Toolbox/tree/master/plotting](https://github.com/imciner2/MATLAB_Toolbox/tree/master/plotting)).
I totally agree with the previous commenter. Getting an answer on here will not prove you know anything and possibly won't teach you anything. If you need help you should be asking your school. If you have already been taught what you need to know and still can't answer, maybe repeating a semester wouldn't be such a bad thing. It really frustrates me that half the posts on here are asking for people to do homework. I'm just glad that when people do help they mostly try to help the poster learn and don't just provide a solution. My advice, read through or step through the code and look at the help for each called function. Then try to work out what it's doing and what you need to change. Also be warned your empty catch might be hiding errors, maybe put a debug print to let you know that path has been taken.
This is more of a general math question, but: signed = can be positive or negative (have a + or - sign recorded by the first bit) unsigned all bits are used to store the value. For example, for 16-bit integers, Signed can have values from -32768 to 32768. The first bit is used to indicate whether or not it's positive or negative, then the other 25 bits are used to store the value. (2^15=32768) Unsigned 16bit integer can have values from 0 to 2^16 or 65536.
Mind sending a screenshot? I’m not sure exactly what you mean
You could implement an already built algorithm that generates you ABC given an input k (such that a = k; b = (k²-1)/2; c = (k²+1)/2), where if you know c, you can calculate k and therefore a and b; and implement it. Idk if it will work with all the triples, but it works.
Unsigned integers are all numbers you know when you are five. Signed integers are all number you know once you learn negative numbers. Sometimes signed integers don't make sense for the data you are storing so it is safer and better (more available numbers) to store it as unsigned. 
You can also let matlab do the expansion &amp;#x200B; No = sum(triu(abs(t(1:end-1)' - t) &lt; tau, 1), 2); &amp;#x200B;
Adding to what the others said: an important related concept is integer overflow. Wikipedia explains it best: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow
Desktop link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow *** ^^/r/HelperBot_ ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove. ^^Counter: ^^249593
To add on to this, signed integers are often stored using their [Two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) representation. Here are a couple of signed 4-bit integers as an example: 0000 -&gt; 0*-8 + 0*4 + 0*2 + 0*1 = 0 0111 -&gt; 0*-8 + 1*4 + 1*2 + 1*1 = 7 1000 -&gt; 1*-8 + 0*4 + 0*2 + 0*1 = -8 1111 -&gt; 1*-8 + 1*4 + 1*2 + 1*1 = -1 1011 -&gt; 1*-8 + 0*4 + 1*2 + 1*1 = -5 Note that the largest positive number that can be represented using N bits in this form is 2^(N-1) - 1 = 7, while the largest (by magnitude) negative number that can be represented is -2^(N-1) = -8.
You will need to use [annotations](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/annotation.html) if you want to add those. The function plot itself won't include the information anywhere but the title (and those outputs you're storing).
Also I think it would be better if you moved No(i) outside the j loop, because it seems like you only want the last value and you're currently doing unneciacry calculations doing it every time the j loop runs
I'm using this to separate an image into it's rgb components. https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/Display-Separated-Color-Channels-of-an-RGB-Image.html
Thank you! That's exactly what I was looking for.
I had used that toolbox already, but as you mentioned wasn't useful for using data in real time. Thank you anyways!
DMP and TMP are the combined Cell array of both Spheres and Aluminum Rods
Yes! The issue that I am having is that we have to solve for the cooling variable and we need to plot it.
&gt; I know I can just put the strings in a cell, but I really need them in a struct for later on in my code. (Unless there's a way to get fprintf to accept cells.) Why not both? Put a cell array of character vectors in the struct. When you use `[str1, str2, ..., strN]` it always concatenates the strings. [`fprintf`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fprintf.html) can most certainly access the cell elements individually, you just need to use [cell indexing](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/access-data-in-a-cell-array.html#AccessDataInCellArrayExample-2), rather than array indexing. For example: fprintf('The third element is %s.\n', mystruct.strings{3});
This has nothing to do with the structure. You're concatenating the strings. Try this at the command line: strings = \['one','two','three'\]; You'll get the same result without the structure.
As /u/angrmgmt00 said, "['one', 'two', 'three']" will always concatenate strings into one megastring. If you want each string to live in a happy little container, you need to use a cell array. Try replacing the square brackets with curly ones, e.g. &gt;&gt;mystruct.strings = {'one','two','three'}; mystruct = struct with fields: strings: {'one' 'two' 'three'}
This is correct. Square brackets build a character array. Curly brackets build an array of strings. Square brackets come in handy when printing numeric values. Example: disp(['x = ', num2str(x)])
This is what i would do also.
How are you reading in the data from excel? You'll probably need to post more of the code for someone to look at.
I used the import tab to bring the data in from excel
Are you sure the loads didn't get imported as a table?
It does say table. I have to import it as a matrix then.

What is your error? I have a guess, and to that guess I'll offer the advice that Matlab is case sensitive. All function calls to inherent Matlab functions are all lowercase. &amp;#x200B; As to the question regarding rounding up or down. Matlab's round function rounds to the nearest integer. While floor and ceil round down and up respectively.
No, but it sounds like fun. Shouldn't be too difficult to make.
Thanks! This is the error I am getting "Undefined function 'Ceil' for input arguments of type 'double'."" The other problem is on the right the Workspace isn't showing any results only for x value, so no m or s value?? is my approach here is right do I need to define each round step with a new variable or just right the command directly!
the only thing I see that may be problematic is the capital C in 'Ceil'. Should be all lowercase. &amp;#x200B; Also thought that 6\*rand would not work, but tried it and it does. If it were me, I would write it as 'x = rand()\*6' &amp;#x200B; As for differences between round(), ceil(), and floor(): ceil() ALWAYS rounds up, floor() ALWAYS round down, and round() will round either up or down depending on the value after the decimal point. it will round up if &gt;= 0.5 and down if &lt; 0.5.
Ok, thanks it worked appreciated what a confusing thing a lower or capital letter changes everything! LOL, I am getting this When the random value of x= 3.2872 celi is is 4 floor is 3 and the round to the nearest number is 3 which I think is right! !
1. To understand these equations you need a basic knowledge of mechanics and circuits (I'll assume that you do since you're attempting to model this) For equation 3, you should look at the relationship of torque, moment of inertia and angular friction. This equation is a common way to model the torque of circular motion For equation 4, it's a simple equation of the sum of voltages equaling 0. VL = L*di/dt VR = i*R So, going from the bottom left corner: -V+L*di/dt+i*R +e = 0 So, L*di/dt + i*R = V - e -&gt; L*di/dt + iR = V - k*d(theta)/dt 2. You should review or learn how to take a Laplace transform. The Laplace form of these equations comes from the Laplace dx/dt &lt;-&gt; s*X(s). So your derivatives become an s. 3. Try to work out the above two points mathematically, going through it in steps (especially Laplace) and you'll be able to get the state space, it's just a rearrangement of the equations to have each of the two variables represented. I know this isn't an in-depth explanation, but this question is hard to explain if you don't have a grasp on the concepts I mentioned above, so look over them, and try to work it out step-by-step
I hope you're not as new as you say, cause I'm in my last quarter of graduate school and my state-space controls class kicked my ass as a mechanical engineer.
What kind of simulation are you doing?
it's for the josephus problem
If you need help with visualizing the concept this is a good video from numberphile. https://youtu.be/uCsD3ZGzMgE I’m not sure how you are supposed to go about creating this simulation, so if you have more details feel free to share.
You're making a char array instead of a string array. If you have a newer version of matlab, try ["one", "two", "three"] instead of ['one', 'two', 'three']
Hmm. What's a practical application for concatenating this way?
I will try this, thanks! I'm trying to pick up Matlab for work, so far it's going well but there are simple little things here and there that keep throwing me.
I didn't even know you could do that, but I'll give it a shot in the morning. Thanks!
Will do, thanks!
You're most welcome.
I'm afraid so! Thanks :)
Thanks, I'll take your advice and maybe go back to review the maths behind this before trying to tackle it.
I see this a lot in code I work with, but I don't like to do it. People use it for formatting things like filenames and strings for display. So, if they wanted to load a bunch of data-files which are numbered like "file1", "file2", it might look like this: filename = ['file', num2str(n), '.mat'] I really don't like to do this, I think it's bulky, and does not give very fine grained control. My preferred approach is: filename = sprintf('file%g.mat, n) You're likely to see both as you work with code from others.
You are calling your nested anonymous functions without arguments, you need to supply both arguments each time you want to use the function (even in another anonymous function). It should be something like diff1 = @(S,I) diff(func1(S,I), S) for each of the cell components. The matrix function then should be: matrix = @(S,I) {diff1(S,I), diff2(S,I); diff3(S,I) diff4(S,I)}
This is not a special thing for strings. Array concatenation always works this way. Try [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] Strings are just character arrays. Like the arrays I wrote are double arrays.
I don't see an error. Although I would expect an error because you capitalized ceil().
Good to know, I haven't seen much like your first example before, but I have run across a fair amount like the second example.
Update: just wrote a program for Newton's method that for the "derivative" just calculates (f(x*1.0001)-f(x*0.9999))/(x*0.0002) And it works pretty well! I don't know why this wasn't more obvious to me sooner
Have you defined a bus object in your workspace which you can use to define the output port data type?
Yes I have. Problem it works by itself but not when it is referenced
My idea is that with Matlab crate all the code for Arudino, without the Arduino IDE, it is posible to do this ?
Your comment equation isn’t displaying too great for me on mobile but your numerical derivative is probably right. You just want to do a finite difference: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference
**Finite difference** A finite difference is a mathematical expression of the form f (x + b) − f (x + a). If a finite difference is divided by b − a, one gets a difference quotient. The approximation of derivatives by finite differences plays a central role in finite difference methods for the numerical solution of differential equations, especially boundary value problems. Certain recurrence relations can be written as difference equations by replacing iteration notation with finite differences. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/matlab/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Exactly what I'm doing! Didn't know there was a fancy term for it
Do you have the required hardware add on for arduino. What error does it generate ?
https://uk.mathworks.com/help/install/ug/activate-an-installation.html
AZfdeg = double(AZfdeg); This should return a double instead of such an obscenely large answer.
Are you using symbolic math? If you want a numerical result, don't use symbols. If you must use symbols, you can use vpa() to produce a numerical answer, but it's better just to use numbers from the beginning.
You can use eval() to have it solve a symbolic output. https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/eval.html On a side note, if your output is symbolic, you can use pretty() to view a more legible version of the output. https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/sym.pretty.html
Yes! Once your trial period ends, you can choose to activate matlab with an activation key. Which is what your school gave you i guess ! Thats how I did it with my school
Deactivate and then reactivate.
They do it (here)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18560050/new-line-in-axis-tick-labels-in-matlab], give that a go. (fyi I googled: matlab newline XtickLabel )
From matlab documentation: " dynamic system represented by the transfer function sys(s) = N(s)/D(s), where s = jw and N(s) and D(s) are called the numerator and denominator polynomials, respectively. The tf model object can represent SISO or MIMO transfer functions in continuous time or discrete time. " &amp;#x200B; So yes!
You can also do s = tf('s') and then: G = RC1 / ( (R2*C1*C4)\*s\^2+(RC4+RC1)\*s+1); bode(G);
There is almost always a much better way to do something than to use `eval`
Background that may give some clarification: s is simply a complex number, which we normally write as σ+jω. However in the context of dynamical systems we assume the σ to be 0. &amp;#x200B; Why? Recall that Fourier/Laplace analysis in this context only describes the steady-state behavior of periodic (sinusoidal) signals. In this context, σ describes the (exponential) growth or decay but since we are looking at steady-state we can ignore the σ term.
Another 'pro'-tip, start your script with s=tf('s'). You can now use s directly as the Laplace variable (without doing the num den thing) &amp;#x200B; s=tf('s'), after which you can directly type &amp;#x200B; G = R\*C1/((R2\**C1\**C4)\*s\^2+(RC4+RC1)\*s+1) Writing this real quick without actually checking the code, but you get the idea
So I have Matlab 2018a on my mac and I am trying to learn Matlab from [MATLAB Onramp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/) and I realized the web version has suggestions like the one on the photo as I type and as a new learner I found it very useful. I updated my 2016 version to 2018 in a hope to get this but sadly wasnt the case. Does anyone know how to turn it on? With some googling I found about the tab suggestion but I am looking for the suggestion box thast comes up as I type
You're getting high frequency spikes at the seam because of the phase discontinuity at the boundary. Are these sounds combinations of pure sine tones? Can you artificially generate the whole thing or are you required to do this by filtering? I don't think it's possible to do this by filtering alone, as a linear filter cannot create a signal at a frequency where it's input has no energy, so those continuous transitions are impossible. If you want to generate the signal completely from scratch, your approach of producing sine tones with frequency changing as a function of time will work fine. You do appear to have gotten the starting and ending frequencies wrong, though. That's simply a mistake on your part, not a problem with the approach in total.
I don't understand your question. If you have what you want to plot in 2D just add a third dimension to space it out for plot3(). You already know what you want each dimension to be so just pass those vectors to plot3(). I guess distance is what you are splitting into four sections? Then make the distance vector the same length as the distance and magnitude vectors, but only fill it 1s, 2s, 3s, or 4s depending on which it represents.
Thanks for the answer, these 2 sounds they are filtered from a manually created wave using a software called GoldWave, (1 pulse looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/zo0jxzJ.png)), the sound is just a concatenation of many of these pulses). This is an approximation of what the fundamental frequency of human voicing looks like, and so by applying filters to it, much like our mouth applies filters to the sound coming from our throat, I'll be achieving vowel sounds. However, some vowel are a combination of two tones, and it's this transition I'm trying to achieve here. Ideally it would be by applying a filter to the sounds, so that I could maintain the intensities in the frequencies, revising my previous illustration, this would be the [ideal solution](https://i.imgur.com/cHeyGQI.png). However, I don't know what type of filter will let me vary the frequencies like this, so that a straight line becomes a slope.
Can you please upload your model(s), making sure to include the Simulink.Bus definition, somewhere?
What have you tried? Using googling “matlab legend change color” gives some solutions, but not sure they are applicable. One solution, ish, would to only include the text in the legend and color it with the corresponding color;)
I've never tried to do exactly what you're doing, but I'll take a stab at it anyway. You can see that the color inside the box on the legend is the color at the "middle" of each surface (the mean RGB color values of the entire surface). The legend itself samples colors from the plot by default, regardless of which type of plot (i.e. this is true for line plots, scatter plots, surface plots, etc.). That behavior gives you three options: 1. Make an invisible axes (`'Visible', 'Off'`) in the same figure with objects having the color properties you want (face and edge color values the same), then use `legend('show')` on that. This will allow you to still use the gradient on the actual surface plot. Things can get weird with size, so you may have to play with it a bit. 2. Use the [`copyobj`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/copyobj.html) function on the handle to the first axes and delete the children of the new axes. Change the properties of the new axes and use the associated legend instead of the legend for the first axes. This is about the same as option 1, just a slightly different approach. 3. Change your `surf` properties to use a single face and edge color per surface instead of a gradient. This will be a loss of visual clarity, but is more straightforward that the previous two approaches. There are some examples of using these approaches to display two legends for a single figure scattered around the internet (MathWorks, StackExchange, etc.), if you need more clarity. Hope that helps!
Linear filters do not let you alter frequency at all. You can suppress, amplify, or phase shift the input frequency, but you cannot generate a frequency that does not exist in the input.
Is this for a mechanical/electrical controls course? Have they introduced you to transfer functions yet? If so, you should check out sisotool in matlab.
Thanks for the clarication
Maybe you're looking for mesh ? I don't really understand your question ?
I had an idea similar to your first option where I’d make a ‘pseudo plot’ with a non-gradient colormap and have ‘FaceAlpha’ set to 0, but it didn’t work how I wanted so I’m down to try your suggestion. I’ll let you know how it goes, thanks!
Haha yeah I’ve been considering just loading the image into microsoft paint and just adding the colors manually
I don't know of a way to do it graphically. If your functions are f1 and f2, you can use the Matlab command fzero() to find where f1-f2=0.
I have a Gaussian pulse defined as G = x*exp(-t^2/y^2) for which it changes over a significant distance z. At each value of z, it has corresponding x and y values. This pulse has significant points of change along z which I want to document. I want my graph to show each of these Gaussian pulses at their respective significant z positions. I also want to show all Gaussian pulses for all z values too but I'm not sure how to do that either.
I'm looking for mesh next, which I'm also not sure how to do. I've replied above.
I think I see what you want. You want some kind of heat map at a given height z ? I already did that... In think I must check my code on the office. I'll come back tomorrow morning.
get the xdata and ydata properties of the lines and do it mathematically. easy algebra.
I have run into a somewhat similar issue before when trying to read CSV files into Matlab. In my case it was just that the CSV delimited the blank spaces in a very large sheet and it took far too long for the csvread and xlsread functions to process one file let alone hundreds. My solution was to do basically what you suggested and read it in as a string using fread (fgetl may work better in your case). I indexed the string looking for commas and newline characters in order to organize the data into a cell array. If your data is fairly well organized (it sounds like it is) then it shouldn't be too difficult to predict where a comma may be missing and write in an if statement that deals with it. There may be a more elegant solution out there, but I couldn't find one in the time I needed so this is how I dealt with it. It got the job done though and it was fast enough that it didn't cause any issues.
So you have four dimensions of data to account for: **t**, **x**, **y**, and **z**? Can you produce a figure with four subplots showing the four distinct z value plots? If that can be done it would be the first step toward either plot3() or surf() or mesh().
Yeah, except height is actually a distance at which the Gaussian has a particular shape due to that z positions respective x and y values. If you can find something that would be great, thanks for your help!
Yeah! I can produce those. I've also got a 2d figure showing the pulses at those positions overlaid with each other. I'll see what I can do tomorrow and get back to you, if that's okay? Thanks for your help!
Sounds like a quadratic programming problem Have you the optimization toolbox?
You are off base on how Matlab works, it's not a graphing calculator. Matlab doesn't solve problems like this graphically (and neither did your graphing calculator but that's besides the point). Use the find command: These two examples likely won't produce any equal values since It uses the random number generation, but just sub in your x and y vectors. If you have matrices the output of find is just [col, row] = find.... To find all indices of equal values of 2 vectors (essentially compares respective values in each vector): X =rand(1,200) Y =rand(1,200) Index = find(X ==Y) To find indices of all Y values equal to the ith X value (comparing every Y value to every X value). This outputs index to a cell array and not a matrix since the size of index for each iteration is likely going to change: For i = 1:length(X) Index{i} = find( X(i) ==Y) end I'm on mobile and just typed this code from memory, but I'm pretty sure its syntaxially correct. I have nothing to do rn sitting it bed but this stuff is SUPER well documented on the math works website and learning how to understand the syntax based on their explanations will help you in the long run when your questions become more convoluted and people can't just answer them for you. It sounds like you're new to matlab, so I suggest you watch some videos about data structures and how to use them. Learn to use cells, something I wish I learned earlier. Also dont just take what I wrote (granted I didn't mess something up from memory) and simply use it, go to the search 'find matlab' and figure out how it actually works. I feel like this thread has become a place for college kids new to matlab have come to get people to figure out their homework for them (which admittedly I just did), and it's getting a little annoying. Put some research in before you go asking for help - that's how it will be in the real world for ya one day.
You could try using fmincon, where your constraints would be x(j)&gt;x(j+1) for each pair of terms in x
There's a great addon from the matlab download section. The script is called "intersections' and it works quite well imo.
What command are you using to read the CSV files? The "readmatrix" command lets you specify delimiters, so you can delimit only on ',' and maybe ' '.
If you are using a recent version of matlab, look through the toolbars and find the “Import” command. That opens an interactive import wizard that allows you to choose the settings such that the date shows up the way you want. You can even export it as a function so you can run it with other files.
I always used Matlab’s import wizard. It seems to skip the hastle and I get what I want correctly every time. It even allows you to write the execution to a function or script so you can run it with several data files of similar formatting.
Another idea is to first plot six elements, in the desired colors, outside of the scope of your data. Then you plot your data and set the axis as above and make your legend only contain six elements.
What is this for? This is a nonlinear problem which does not behave well with linear control techniques.
Well I did not find my code, [but I found from where I took it.](http://www.peteryu.ca/tutorials/matlab/image_in_3d_surface_plot_with_multiple_colormaps) If I understood what you want, you do not need the first surf. And change the `imgzposition = -10;` by your z value. Let me know if this helped you ! :)
I'm not sure what problem you are having. Is findpeaks not working?
In the `'Format'` argument for `readtable` you can specify dates like `%{MM/dd/uuuu}D`. The syntax is documented in the page for `textscan`, I think; and weirdly there's no link to it from the `readtable` documentation. You might also want to specify a`'DateLocale'`. Not sure.
I can’t get a physical list of the peaks
Sisotool!
Right but... What happens? Is there an error message? Does your computer crash? Do you get output that doesn't make sense? It's not easy to be helpful when you're being secretive about what your problem is.
I mean, I'm sure you learned this in class? Matlab cannot do for you what is fundamentaly impossible. Either your problem is unsolvable or you have misunderstood the assignment. Knowing that should help you to figure out what your actually want to do, because certainly it isn't what you asked, which is impossible.
That seems fine if you're going to to be working with one value at a time at a low volume. However if your code is vectorized you'll get better performance with something like vA = zeros(size(t)); vA(t &lt; 2/24) = 139.072; vA((t &gt;= 2/24) &amp; (mod(floor(t),7) == 0) &amp; ((t-floor(t)) &lt;= 1/24)) = 173.840; vA(treatment(:,3) == 1) = 0;
Yea but if your simulating a nonlinear ode then you need to treat one at a time. Still though you'll need a derivatives routine that takes time and the state as a variable and then use something like ode45 to integrate. Check out implementing ode45 on YouTube.
Check out the documentation for the findpeaks command, specifically the section that uses the format [pks, locs] = findpeaks(data) https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/findpeaks.html#bufbbs1-locs
The calculation of Delta\_rho\_num, is that meant to be taking the inverse of the matrix? It might not help, but I typically use the built-in function for matrix inverses `inv().` If it's being multiplied by a vector or another matrix, you can also do `A\b` instead of `inv(A)*b` or `A^(-1)*b` Or you may need to look at your matrix, since it sounds like it is not invertible given the error message.
Would it be possible for you to give me an example of that code?
it's complicated, this is my honours project and it's practically completely alien to anything I learnt in class (CS degree)
Yes the inverse of HessianMatrix_num gave an error. I have tried all the above methods you mentioned but to no avail. It is due to the PART_y_PART_rho_num = lsim(PART_y_u_PART_rho_tf,SpecialExperimentOutput_num(:,1),TimeVector_num); then PART_y_PART_rho_num(i,:)'*PART_y_PART_rho_num(i,:) produces a matrix that is invertible but I just don't understand why.
Something like this: num = 64; % the other number mn = min(16,num); mx = max(16,num); idx = (array(:,2) &gt;= mn &amp; array(:,2) &lt;= mx) | isnan(array(:,2)); then use logical indexing to filter the rows: result = array(idx,:);
My general suggestion is to get everything into matlab and then do analysis. So load a file, extract and store in (cell)arrays all data that is relevant for whatever you need to do next and then load the next file. In a next step you can e.g. `unique` (or sort if you know there are 4 of each) to find which files belong together.
[Regular expressions](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/regexp.html), a running list of product numbers and the [`ismember`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ismember.html) function, and a standardized folder naming convention (implementable with [`sprintf`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/sprintf.html)) could be useful for solving this type of problem. That's the first thing that came to mind; there may be other/better routes. I'm assuming you already know how to work with files.
If I understood correctly, you have a bunch of existing files that you'd like to organize into folders according to a pattern in the filename. For example, say you had the following files ("yyyy, product number xxx.txt" for year and product number): 2011, product number 573.txt 2013, product number 573.txt 2015, product number 573.txt 2012, product number 600.txt 2013, product number 600.txt 2014, product number 600.txt 2012, product number 700.txt 2013, product number 700.txt 2015, product number 700.txt What I would do is first get a listing of all the file names (`dir` function), extract the pattern from the filenames (`regexp` is quite handy here), then move the files into their corresponding folder. Something like this: cd('C:\path\to\base\folder'); % navigate to directory containing files files = dir('*.txt'); for i=1:numel(files) % parse pattern in file name fname = files(i).name; tok = regexp(fname, '(\d+), product number (\d+)', 'tokens', 'once'); [year, num] = deal(tok{:}); % create dir if necessary and move file if ~isdir(num) mkdir(num); end movefile(fname, num); end The result for the above example would be: &gt;&gt; !tree /F . +---573 ¦ 2011, product number 573.txt ¦ 2013, product number 573.txt ¦ 2015, product number 573.txt ¦ +---600 ¦ 2012, product number 600.txt ¦ 2013, product number 600.txt ¦ 2014, product number 600.txt ¦ +---700 2012, product number 700.txt 2013, product number 700.txt 2015, product number 700.txt
Post what you need help with, how far are you with the problem, what have you tried so far?
Everything. I just need the MATLAB code / solutions to the probs.
I'll give that a go, thank you! :)
I can help. My suggestion would be to write some Matlab code to calculate the answer.
You're welcome !!
Yeah thats what Im asking help for
Good! I'm glad I could help :)
Attempt the problem and ask for specific help when you get stuck. We can help but we’re not going to do it for you.
Your parents must have dropped you when you were a baby its fine
Go do your mom
Can you post your entire input for your function? i.e.: NewtonMeth(f,g,a,b) Just exactly what you're typing in when you're running your code.
sure. calling NewtonMeth(f,g,0.2,1.8) Where: f = @(x,y)x*(1+y^2)-1 g = @(x,y) (y* (1+x^2 ) -2)
I'm not the one who can't figure out his homework. Good luck with that career!
What's this for, anyway? EECS 1028? You should check the academic honesty policy: http://www.cs.yorku.ca/admin/coscOnAcadHonesty.html Does Suprakash teach that? I wonder what his email is...
Hi, To me it looks like one of your derivations might have an error in it. The transfer function is third order but the state space model is second order. You can use the functions ss2tf() and tf2ss() to convert between state space and transfer functions to compare them and make sure they're correct. Hope this helped.
I think the output from your space state model is angular velocity and the output from the transfer function is angular position.
I figured it out. Since it was data from an FTIR, I was in wave numbers where you measure from high to low I had to invert the two list to find the peaks and position.
Hello, thanks for responding. Apologies but I'm still stuck, if I could ask for a little more help.. &amp;#x200B; Can you please show me how I use the two functions you mentioned? I don't know how I'm supposed to use them as I'm not familiar with them Also can you please explain how you new that the transfer function was 3rd order and state space was 2nd order? I cannot tell...
I’m going to go out on a limb here and say your professor or TA would gladly sit down with you and help you.
Forger about excel and use CSV, you will like yourself better in the long run.
Proprietary Microsoft knows what’s best for you! Man, that sucks... I’m feeling you
You should review Newton's method. The goal is to update your guess by computing x_{n+1} = x_n - v where v is the solution to the linear equation DF(x_n)*v = F(x_n). Starting from the line `j = ...` I don't have a clue what you are doing but it isn't Newton's method. For starters, you shouldn't be computing the determinant of anything.
So you would want to set up your constraints in matrix form as follows C=[-1,1,0;0,-1,1]; D=[0;0]; These will be for your inequality constraints, which are C*x&lt;=D. This is equivalent to saying that we want x(1)&gt;=x(2) and x(2)&gt;=x(1). Next you have to define your objective function fun=@(x)(A*x-B)’* (A*x-B); By minimizing this, you will find the x that will best solve A*x=B in the least-squares sense. Finally, you need to define an initial guess x0 that satisfies the constraints C*x&lt;=D and then solve the problem via fmincon x=fmincon(fun,x0,C,D); Depending on the problem, you may have to look further into fmincon in terms of controlling the algorithm and various parameters.
Someone who asked for help cheating on a final probably didn't spend a lot of time in office hours.
Very true
Ouch
What do you have so far?
Google the function. Highest order of transfer function (TF) denominator 's' is the order. For state space (ss) it's the size of A
&gt;Please help me, I'm new to MATLAB and somehow I need a crash course on how to do this Sure! You read the problem, and understand it. You think about how you would solve it by hand. You write code that does that, reading the documentation when you don't know how to express your ideas.
All my W10 systems today decided it was time for an update. I don't know how to disable this!
Linux! So that only your boss can accidentally stop your code from running
Yea do a file save as CSV and use importdata instead of xlsread.
If you have Windows 10 Pro, you can use the group policy editor to disable this behaviour!

Have you tried readtable instead?
14 hour code? God damn how long is it lol
I wrote the code for my thesis in Matlab and due to some oversights wound up finding it my results were no good a month before graduation. So I actually left to start my job before graduating and finished my thesis remotely, using my home PC because it was beefier than the lab machine I had. I moved into a shitty old apartment with electric that was never meant for the amount of appliances we had (and every time the breaker tried it was a walk across the building to flip the dude box switch). Anyway whenever I ran code we corkscrew use the microwave for the 20 hours it took to complete. My wife and I forgot enough times, and crashed enough of my runs, that I rewrote the output to basically write the output and even intermediate steps to files every step so I could read in the last bit used and have my code hop in from there when it started up again. It bumped my run time by like 15-20% but saved me a ton of time overall since I wouldn't randomly have 18 hours of a run scrapped by accident. Point is, I feel your pain my dude.
My PhD work took ten days to run in parallel on a 20 CPU cluster.
Have you tried writing your problems in pseudocode/algorithm? That might help you start.
What exactly are you having problem with? The reading part? The compression part?
Reading, the compression I can get.
Semi-protip: Matlab has a very well-written documentation. Just type in `doc` and start reading from there. You can get everything you need there.
Bad news. You can't disable it.
I feel you. I have run simulations that take a weekend to run only to return and find my computer restarted. 72 hours to the trash. It really sucks.
Are you running the Home edition? Had that shit happen to me for overnight jobs a couple times (doesn't let you disable autoupdates). Ended up disabling the WiFi every time I had to do overnight or weekend runs.
Nah what is that?
Well I can't provide you with the solution, that's not what this sub is about, show us how far you've gotten with your code, we might be able to help you solve it.
On my last program I was running analysis that took 4 days to complete, on 12 cores plus a GPU.
I've tried doing it with the code you sent to me and it actually lowered performance and stop one of the ODEs producing solutions. I have been told that maybe an else if statement should be used instead. For another if statement that depends on only two time ranges, the if statement works as intended. Does this mean an else if is needed for more than two?
I have implemented the ode45 to solve the numerical solutions but to produce the correct numerical solution for one of the ODEs, I need vA to be a specific value depending on time
What error are you getting? There's absolutely nothing wrong with using an array of doubles as input to trapz.
Sucks for sure! Just make sure to be proactive with security updates and you should be fine so it doesn't happen next time. Also, you probably have it set to do restarts in the middle of the night. Forget where that setting is, just that it exists in W10.

Jesus christ. Was it necessary to post hundreds of lines of text output? ode45 will output a solution point for each input value for the time variable, when you provide it more than 2 points, as documented here: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ode45.html Keep in mind that what ode45 considers the "time" variable and what you're calling time are inverted, but that's simply a matter of labeling. ode45 solves DEs of the form dy/dt = f(x, t), but in your case t is xa and x is t, which is quite confusing but not a problem. In any case there's no way that the solution to a DE is a single number, particularly when you ask for the solution at multiple time values.
What would it even mean to form the triangulation of an image? A delauny triangulation is an operation defined on points (coordinate value pairs).
There isn't necessarily a general solution to this but you could look at the unwrap() function.
Ah I see. I was supposed to find local minima in an audio spectrogram and then apply Delaunay triangulation to connect those points
I understand that but is VA an independent variable? If so you just you just need to add those if statements to your derivatives routine in your ode45 routine. Ode45 though is for differential equations of motion. Perhaps you're going down the wrong direction. The photo you linked is just a time dependent piecewise continuous function not an ordinary differential equation. Either you left some information out or you shouldn't be using ode45. -C.
Oh I see. That's not a pre-written routine, you'll have to do that yourself. Break it up into parts and work on each piece separately. First you need to focus on a way to find local minima, which isn't hard but isn't trivial either.
 Maybe I was badly expressed. To be more detailed, it's about reaction in the reactor. It is necessary to find the time for which a conversion of 75% or 0.75 is achieved. So I need the reaction time in the reactor. Is it clearer now?
So I have the spectrogram values which is a 4097 x 8 size matrix. If I run islocalmin function on it, I am able to get a same sized matrix with 0s and 1s (1s corresponding to local minimas) I am not sure how they find a local minima (whether they consider the 2d information or just column information), but I wanted to visualize the output. How do I plot those points corresponding to 1s on top of my spectrogram plot? Here's what I have done so far: [audio, fs] = audioread(path); f = figure(); [S,F,T] = spectrogram(audio, [], [], [], fs); S = 10*log10(abs(s)); [TF1,P] = islocalmin(S); imagesc(T, F, S) % this is plotting the spectrogram perfectly hold on; Now what do I write to plot TF1 matrix (which is the matrix of 0s and 1s)?
Try and look at the doc, type `help linspace` or `doc linspace` (whichever has your personal prefrence). If you still have troubles, come back and explain to my what you think the doc means. (i'll be back in an hour, but there's tons of helpfull people here)
Yes, I’ve referred to the help linspace page. It’s a useful command if you know the size of the vector already, and you just want to know the step size between a starting and ending point with that number that correspond to that size. I’m not sure how to utilize it to give me how many steps of 0.04 are between -5 and 5 though. Probably just because I’m not understanding.
Actually, I just found out I can make a vector V= [-5:0.04:5]; size(V) it returns that v is a 1 by 251 matrix which is what I needed. That’s a pretty simple way to do this, but is there another way you know of?
The code runs in a loop, and as such if I use fzero I would have to have different initial guesses for the equation for each iteration of the loop. I'd rather it be more 'robust' so to speak. I've tried quad as well, but is there any other way to solve the equation to get a numerical result then? Also, so I can't convert this tcd_value to anything else?
Through the power of math! But there are some considerations. V= \[-5:0.04:5\] is the preferable way to generate a linearly spaced array **with given stepsize,** while linspace also generates a linearly spaced array but **with known number of steps.** If you insist on using linspace (because homework? idk), its a straight forward calculation which I hope you'll be able to figure out after i rephrase it like this: &amp;#x200B; You want to divide the space from -5 to 5 in N equal steps, such that each step is 0.04 long, how many steps do you need? Note that the total space between -5 and 5 is 10. &amp;#x200B; If you consider the above question in the way i intended, you'll be off by one. Try to figure out where that one comes from. (something something space and edges)
Thank you!

I don't really need to know the details of your field to talk about the mathematical issues. Maybe you're expecting ode45 to behave differently than it actually does. Have you taken a look at the documentation?
