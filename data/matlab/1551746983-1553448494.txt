You kind of have a point but MATLAB's table is more similar to Pandas Dataframe. Numpy array is more or less the same as a MATLAB array. Overall you have to keep better track of the data types in Python. You can use different data types in MATLAB but they are not something you have to consiously think about unless you really want to.
Coming at it from a graduate level research standpoint in the US, I can definitely confirm that Python is definitely becoming a big deal in the US. But it’s my impression that most professors who have experience in both are more inclined to use Matlab.
Those are software companies, not engineering or research organizations. It's really no surprise you'd move away from Matlab if you're trying prepare students for careers NOT in science or engineering. 
Then should this line: p = p0 - (f(p0)/df(p0)); &amp;#x200B; be p = p0 - (FCN2(p0)/FCN2(p0)) ? How do I know if the numerator will call f and denominator will call df? &amp;#x200B;
&gt;First of all, that’s an engineering firm. Yes. Matlab is intended specifically for engineering applications. 
You need to call your function and have it return outputs, then use them: [f,df] = FCN2(p0); p = p0 - (f/df); 
Ohhh I see. I appreciate your help. Also, I'm getting an error "unexpected MATLAB expression." for this code. &amp;#x200B; function \[f,df\] = FCN2(x) f = x\^3+2\*x\^2+10\*x-20; df = 3x\*\^2+4\*x+10; end &amp;#x200B; Specifically, There's a red squiggly line on line 3, below the x (for the term 3x\*\^2). What is the issue?
Thank you very much for your help. I ran the code in the command window, and now it's giving me the following error: "Subscript indices must either be real positive integers or logicals." &amp;#x200B; I'm not even sure which part of the code is causing the error. Any idea?
you should run it from a script, not the command line. That way, when there's an error, it will tell you what line the error is on. You can also set breakpoints and/or run the code line by line to see that it's working correctly.
Cost difference between student license and no-longer-a-student license was one reason I switched from MATLAB to Python. The idea that science should be open-source (i.e. open to inspection), easily reproducible, and help the poor was another. (I mean, poor countries should also be able to reproduce my work as a scientist.)
I see. I tried to run the following code from the script as you suggested. &gt;i = 1; &gt; &gt;p0 = 1; &gt; &gt;imax = 100; &gt; &gt;error = 0.000000000000001; &gt; &gt;\[f,df\] = FCN2(p0); &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;while i &lt;= i &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;p = p0 - (f/df); &gt; &gt;if (abs(p-p0)/abs(p)) &lt; error &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;fprintf('Solution is %f \\n', double(p)) &gt; &gt;return &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;end &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;i = i + 1; &gt; &gt;p0 = p; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;end &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;fprintf('Solution did not converge within %d iterations at a required precision of %d \\n', i, error') &gt; &gt;end &amp;#x200B; Now there's an issue with the "end" function at the very end. "Illegal use of reserved keyword "end". Why is this happening? &amp;#x200B;
Are you new to coding in MATLAB? Each if and while statement requires a matching end statement. (Hint: select all and then use the green smart indent button to see where it pairs each end statement)
Correct. Very new to MATLAB. I just did what you suggested and it looks like the last end is not needed. I don't understand why my solution is not converging though...
This is kind of broad. Some questions that will help us help you better: * How much time will you dedicate to the project? * Is it mainly a programming project or will you do music, pixel art, balance game mechanics etc. as well? How do you want to balance them, and what are your interests? * Will the project die when you are done with it, or do you want to be able to continue working with it indefinitely? Some very broad tips: * Use git. Or at least some kind of version control system. This is helpful when you program alone, and essential when you are two people working together. * Start small. Build a "minimal viable product" ASAP. Don't get stuck on some attack animation for unit #74 the first week. * Are you sure Matlab is your language? Matlab is mainly used for scientific computing, not game programming. You can make a game in Matlab, and it will be a good learning experience, but it probably won't be "optimal". I would suggest you use python and [pygame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygame). There are good tutorials for it. 
IMO: Not going anywhere as far as control-systems or signal-processing is concerned. However, for general data-processing and plotting my tool of choice would be R.
There’s more to learn with Python, which is probably quite important in an educational environment. It requires python + numpy + scipy + matplotlib to get the same basic functionality as Matlab, which is a lot of baggage to get through if it’s just a semester course on DSP or whatever. On the other hand Python is open source, runs everywhere and is useful in many other contexts as well. I did machine learning in Matlab, but these days it’s all about Python in that field. 
We do most our engineering calculations in MathCad. We use excel to analyse data and a few of us use MatLab. If you work in a large company then someone will likely be using it somewhere evem if you don't know about it.
I suggest your error is too small. Try something like 4*eps. Due to numerical errors there won’t be real convergence. 
You need to talk to your university administration about the cost of the campus license. That is incredibly expensive. If you add toolboxes it goes through the roof even with student license.
Not really. People are leaving OOP especially in scientific code. It is not for everyone and you really don't need it. Besides OOP in matlab is something I don't wish anybody gets stuck with
Come to the dark side https://github.com/ilayn/harold The more the number of users the more I am tempted to implement stuff. Quite a number of companies that can't afford matlab already using it ;) Simulink is another story though. We are working on it.
For ML? Possible, yeah, Python might become the king (or it may already be the king!) &amp;#x200B; But I can't see Python overtaking Matlab in Control Systems, Fuzzy Logic, Signal Processing etc
“None of the big tech companies are using ML” This is simply not true. No many how many times it gets repeated by you. Still not true.
My university only uses MATLAB for a few math courses, everything else has been changed to Python. 
does this documentation help at all? I'm not positive if that's what you're looking for, but it sounds like it. [https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab\_prog/combine-date-and-time-from-separate-variables.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/combine-date-and-time-from-separate-variables.html)
When I was teaching Economics and Finance we switched from MATLAB to Python exactly for these reasons. 
MATLAB is super cheap for what you get. If AGI Systems Tool Kit (STK) is still a thing when it is $10,000 per seat without modules, then MathWorks has a long way to go until it is overtaken by freeware.
That’s not what I said
By ML I meant MATLAB. 
No one abbreviates it that way but it’s still wrong. Kaggle’s survey puts the “most used language” at 54% to 2.3% Python to Matlab; JetBrains’ survey puts it at 53% to 3%; Oreilly’s puts it at something like 54% to 12%. Big tech companies don’t use matlab because it’s bad practice, super fucking expensive, opaque, and alternatives exist. The engineering companies still use it but I was think more FAANG
I was talking FAANG’s. I don’t doubt engineering firms still use it
Matlab just simply doesn’t have access to all the tools that Keras/TensorFlow, PyTorch, Apache Spark give you and that’s the end of it.
Okay but research organizations are shifting from Matlab to python. I know because I work at the one initiating this change in the field of neuroscience 
I would have thought given the quote attributed to you, you could have pattern matched what I meant, but cool. I agree with you that Python is much more widely used as a general purpose language. I think that's totally reasonable, Python is a better general purpose language by its nature. My point was that in specific domains and groups such as camera and computer vision groups at Apple and Google, MATLAB is still in use. So, your blanket statement is just not true from my personal experience. From your other statements about OOP, I get a distinct sense that you have pretty limited personal experience and perhaps zero commercial software development experience.
The fact is, OOP is best practices for teams working on codebases at any software company and Matlab just doesn’t support this well. Obviously there are other ways of programming but you’re missing the point I was making
This is why I hate on Matlab. It instills bad practices and encourages spaghetti code. Maybe you can code just fine in it because you have experiences in other languages (I actually really learned in Java) but, if you start on Matlab, you’re pretty hamstrung
I've worked as a commercial software developer for 15 years. I think you were making a false choice between OO and other valid programming paradigms that have a legitimate place because you aren't aware of those other paradigms and are speaking from a very limited place of personal experience and a tremendous place of inflated ego.
I agree with that too. PyTorch and TensorFlow are great tools and Python is a great language. No one here said otherwise I don't think.
I wasn’t making a statement of OOP vs other paradigms. I was making a statement about OOP vs the typical script-writing that’s so pervasive in Matlab programmers especially coming from science or engineering backgrounds
Let me clarify, Matlab is not the primary language in use at any large software or data science companies. I’m sure it’s being used in research teams that benefit from some of its packages which are superior to python but it’s not used company-wide.
Yes. That is absolutely true. We agree on that. None of the big software companies are deploying MATLAB code.
so the last value corresponds to 21-May-2018 16:05:14 ?
The waveform you want looks like the output of a three phase diode rectifier. The thyristor rectifier waveform will only look like that if you set the firing angle so the thyristors always conduct. Since you're using a capacitor inductor and a DC source as part of the output network it will not really look like that anyways. If you want to see that waveform you should make the load completely resistive.
I’ve had to learn matlab with my uni and the teacher was shocked we hadn’t touched it for the first 3 years, before we would use python with jupyter notebook and other than easily seeing variables it does the same. 
It's quite possible to write bad code in any language. In fact OO concepts allow for even greater heights of absurdity. That doesn't mean they're bad but they're certainly no magical cure for bad programming. 
If you convert the dates to a Matlab date number (using `datenum()`) you can do whatever arithmetic with your dates that you'd like. A datenum is in units of days, expressed relative to some start date. 
I worked for ASML. They are trying to get out of matlab as soon as possible (which is admittedly not very fast because legacy). I did a lot of control work there before I left.
You can't really do that if the functions are not local to that function .m file. Inside an .m file you can't do function definitions and custom code. 
Yeah you can since like .. 2016? You can have a script that calls a function that you define inside that script. Is that what you mean?
You can't expose those functions. Everything has to be either in the same file or must be in separate .m files in the path. That's not really changing anything since I would have to just keep the functions in the path. These are all matlab's struggle with trying to build a working namespace concept other languages had for decades. 
I mean compared to using no paradigm at all
What would that even mean. 
I thought that the completely resistor load but today I set the constant as zero then I got the output as [like](https://imgur.com/t2Yyk0A) that and [here](https://imgur.com/oBK2LwK) is general wiew of blocks. 
yep I just renamed the conflicted one and it works great now. The awkward thing was it was in a package I didn't create, so I was hesitant to mess with it
Whoa cool! I'll definitely give that a look, thanks!
I'd put a break point at the line where your error occurs and then check the size of your inputs. The error message is telling you what the problem is, so one of the inputs is not the size you think. 
Yeah I've tried fixing these problems one by one like that, I've actually managed to get things the right size and get past that error, but that just creates errors down the line and I think it messes with the integrity of the code. Like, I feel like the fixes I've found to make things the right size mean that it is no longer doing what I want it to do. So I figure there is something fundamental with the way it's set up initially that I can't figure out.
I can help you with this, but I first want to make sure you’re doing this correctly... how and why are you solving for the local element displacements? Usually you’d want to 1) find the local stiffnesses for each element, then 2) assemble them into a global stiffness matrix. Solving K global\ forces will then give you the global displacements. 
B=ColumnB + ColumnA(end); A= ColumnA(1:end-1); NewCol= [A; B]; (I may not understand what you are trying to do but thought this may give you some data manipulation ideas)
Thanks for the response! The code hopefully is designed for 3 node line elements acting under axial forces. I am using a predetermined stiffness matrix for a 3 node element and with that I have calculated the global stiffness matrix. I have calculated the global displacements at each of these nodes from this stiffness and the external forces. Part of the assignment asks for the displacement along the beam, for this I have used the shape function for each 3 node element to work out the displacement at incremental length along the element. Now i have multiple columns of local displacements that I think need to be placed like the format above to plot a graph for the global displacement. 
Thank you, I will attempt it again!
&gt; I feel like the fixes I've found to make things the right size mean that it is no longer doing what I want it to do Do you know what inputs you want to put into your regression model? You shouldn't just make changes to get the code to run, you need to know why you're putting the data into different places. 
Is there a required textbook for the course? I like Gilat's Numerical Methods for Engineers and Scientists, as many of the examples and problems are pulled from real world examples. Your school library hopefully should have a copy, but also just looking at other Matlab books in the library could be useful. Also, office hours with the Prof. and/or TAs will help you get a better idea of how the specific course expects you to program/format/types of problems.
Thanks for your response! So this project is a semester long project that is starting kinda late, which means we have until early march, roughly 2 months. It is mainly just a programming project so the main visuals of the characters moving, doing damage, each having a certain number of hit points etc. is the main concern. The MatLab project itself will technically die because will we be presenting and turning it in for a grade. Moving to the next portion of your response; Unfortunately because it is a MatLab class, we are limited to using MatLab to program the game and I have been told that MatLab isn't the best for making games. However, I am super interested in doing the same project on my own time but instead learning to use python. Ill link a video to some gameplay of the game that we are modeling. The changes that we will be making to the game: - taking away the princess/archer towers, making it just a one tower versus one tower - making the troops we include only have single target damage - all troops will move the same speed Mostly everything else will be staying the same. Quick rundown of the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hNxfiXmeAE 
How does one run something like this using a .m file?
I think Jesus Salazar has a good book and I'm pretty sure there's a PDF out there somewhere. 
Yes, we have to use Essential MATLAB for Engineers and Scientists by Hahn and Valentine. The degree is online, so there are no TA hours. I did contact my professor and he recommended doing more examples from the Matlab site. I have a perfect score for my all my homework so far, but I usually spend 8-10 hours just to complete 3 or 4 problems that are assigned. I can brute force my way through them with the book, but that's not helping me learn how to program.
Thanks! I'll check it out.
I would recommend [Cody](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/cody/), and specifically the [Cody Challenge](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/cody/problems?term=group%3A%22Cody+Challenge%22&amp;sort=created+asc). It gives you a variety of problems to work on, and covers tons of ground. It's one of the best learning tools available for MATLAB.
Are things better now OP? Or do you still need help with any of this?
https://github.com/sunnypatel18/CS-1371-Homework/tree/master/Homework Old homework’s from the intro MATLAB class at my school. They’re pretty good practice 
Cool! Two months isn't a lot of time, especially if you are learning at the same time. My two old tips of version control and starting small still holds. It is nice that you already know what you want to simplify, but the game should be a lot simpler than that. Aim to have something "playable" that has the core mechanics by the end of the week. You should probably do some kind of design. An object oriented approach work well for games. Figure out what classes you need and what behavior they should have. I'm not really sure hos to make a game in Matlab, but people have done it. See if you can find any open source examples to steal from.

Looks a little like (1/tan x). I might start with that.
r/AspenPlusHelp is a new subreddit for this as well
What documentation do you have for the RGB LED? Can you get the colours you want manually setting the inputs with a DC power supply? Next step would be to emulate this entirely with Arduino. There should be plenty of relavant examples online that don’t require Matlab. All Matlab is actually doing is sending text commands down a serial port to tell the Arduino how to set the analog out pins. So if you then want some quality of life code that takes an input like `RED’ and turns that into the command that makes the LED turn red you can use something like a switch/case loop. Have a look at the example code called `why’. Enter open why At the Matlab command line and take a read of the code. Run it a few times by simply typing why
It's line-to-line back-emf signals of BLDC motors after divide, Eab/Ebc,.... Thanks for your attention, NormP.
https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/8nuom7/truss_element/ I added the assembler as one of the comments. That might help you 
I can change the color by manually sending DC voltage to certain pins. My code to simulate a traffic light worked, but my professor claimed I was doing things “the long way” and was told to just figure it out. The only documentation I can find for controlling an LED is the giving voltage one at a time. I understand *how * it works, it’s just that the way he wants me to do it seems impossible.
And there is a problem with my pulses. They should be [like](https://imgur.com/WK5c39j) that. There should be 60 degree between each pulse but my pulses are [like](https://imgur.com/mFGmz0Z) that. They don't have 60 degree between each other and width for same pulse is not same,some are thin, some are thick. How set 60 degree between the pulses?
Maybe the [area plot function](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/area.html) ?
Assuming you use relatively high transparency if two signals overlap, they should create a darker area. Although tuning could be tricky. The other option is taking your data and turning it into a 3D plot via binning (e.g. taking squares of X,Y values and seeing how many 1D signals fall into each one giving you Z). Maybe look at something like a 3-D histogram to see where most of your data is using hist3() or other type of surface plot. In general I would recommend this, as you will have a matrix corresponding to intensity to work with, and it will me much easier to manipulate and adjust things.
Do you know what the Normal distribution is? Do you know what 'mean' and 'variance' are? Or do you have some other question. Reading it, the question seems very clear, so I'm not sure how to help.
Hey Weed_O_Whirler, I hope you have a wonderful day.
this problem is trying to demonstrate this: &amp;#x200B; [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/NYW-confidence-interval.svg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/NYW-confidence-interval.svg) &amp;#x200B; Taken from the "Interpretation" section of the Wikipedia article: &amp;#x200B; [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence\_interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval)
So what does your Matlab code do? You just input a number and that sets the voltage to match for a single pin?
&amp;#x200B; You need to store the values using an index, for example: alpha\_lower(i) = bint(1,1); It's good practice to initialize them first, outside the for loop, for example: alpha\_lower = zeros(100,1); However, it might reduce the total number of variables if you just store 'bint' in a 3-dimensional array, for example: bint2(:,:,i) = bint; This will produce a 2x2x100 array. Finally, you can do this directly in the function call, for example for i=1:100; \[b(:,i),bint(:,:,i)\] = regress(); end
I know what these mean but i don't know what he meant by 10,000 samples of size 10, do i need 10,000 different distributions? And if so am i not gonna get the same values if the parameters of the samples are the same? And for part 3 is there a way to do it automatically on matlab? I'm sure they don't expect us to check for 10,000 intervals... Thanks 
Okay, thank you
So you can think of it this way. If I have a normal distribution of some "true" mean and variance, and I get 100,000 samples from it, and then estimate the mean and variance, my estimate for the mean and variance will probably be very, very close to the "true" mean and variance. However, if I only take a handful of random samples from that distribution, my ability to estimate the true mean and variance will be limited. If my mean is, say, 10, with a variance of 2, and I only get 5 random samples, for instance, it's possible all 5 will be greater than 10 (just by luck of the draw) so I would estimate a mean greater than 10. So, this is showing that for small sample spaces (only 10 at a time), your estimate of the mean and variance won't be great for any single sample. However, if you have 10,000 samples of 10 each, you'll be able to estimate the mean and variance better. And no, you won't get the values every time, because your random number generator will output different random values from your distribution every time. And yes, there are tools in MATLAB to help you with this. Collect your outputs for your sample mean and variance in vectors, and then you can use MATLAB's built in tools to help you. 
Okay, got it. Thanks a lot.
Basically. It’s digital logic so I have the individual pins of the LED getting sent voltage using the writeDigitalPin command. I had it working that way, he just told me I was doing it wrong and was taking the long way and shouldn’t create colors by individually lighting the pins (1 writeDigitalPin per pin of the LED)
A1) Not really. You may need to define RandomCoordinate as an array, such that you have something like RandomCoordinate = [12*rand, 12*rand] then for example, RandomCoordinate(1) will be the x coordinate of the random coordinate. A2) From the documentation: y = linspace(x1,x2,n) generates n points. The spacing between the points is (x2-x1)/(n-1). So you'd need something like theta = linspace(0, 360, 200) (Might need to take into account some rad/deg issues) 
How do I solve this using “if”, “while”, “for” and “logical operators”? I don’t need the solution, I just want to know how and where do I start I’m so lost in this problem...
For Q3, you can do something like this for the last section of code: storedData = []; %initializes array of indefinite size (memory-expensive) for ii = 1:runVariable if(xPoints)&gt;= -12 &amp;&amp; (xPoints)&lt;= 12 storedData(ii) = 1; else storedData(ii) = 0; end yesRows = sum(storedData == 1); noRows = sum(storedData == 0); yesAnswers = sum(yesRows); noAnswers = sum(noRows); end &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
try: x=[0:0.01:0.5]; y=1-cos(x); x2=[0.5:0.01:1] n=max(size(x)); n2=n+max(size(x2)); y(n:n2)=sin(x)
x1 = 0:0.01:0.5; y1 = 1 - cos(x); x2 = 0.5:0.01:1.0; y2 = sin(x); x = [x1 x2]; y = [y1 y2]; plot(x,y)
Have you looked at table arrays? [https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/table.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/table.html) You can access the values using the string directly. For your example: Tablename('X',2) it will give you 25. &amp;#x200B; In almost any case generating thousands of dynamically named variables is a bad idea which will be very difficult to deal with. 
I am struggling to see the need to programmatically create so many names for these variables, and am inclined to think it is a bad ideal. I can see (at least I think) the logic of what you want to do. For example, you'd like to import a column of data, with locations from "A1" to "AN", so you'd get a collection of variables named "A1", "A2", "A3".... At the end of the day though, I think it will be a great struggle to do anything with data stored in such a format. For example, if you want to do a loop over all these variables, there is no way to tell Matlab to select "A3" or "A4" on it's own: if you had 100 variables, you'd have to type out something like "SUM = A1 + A2 + A3 + .... + A100." Furthermore, using any kind of features in Matlab such as plotting will be extremely difficult with this data. If this is indeed what you want to do, there is a [forum post on the Matlab Website](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/105936-how-to-make-dynamic-variable-names-a1-a2-an-with-for-loop-using-eval-num2str) that describes some approaches (and more of why it is not the best idea). The better approach, would be to store all these different values in an array. Instead of having values called "A1", "A2" etc., you'll have an array called "A", which you can access different elements of using "A(1)", "A(2)". A different approach, is if you want to associate numbers (or other information) with text strings. For example, say I had some people with names (Jim, Bob, etc), and I want to store their age in a "container" named by their real name, there is the [containers.Map](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/containers.map.html;jsessionid=605f805b09e3313b341486923b42) function, where you could store data referenced by text. In your problem, you could assign this text to be the column names from Excel.
Of course it's possible. MATLAB is Turing complete, it is capable of making literally any program you want. You'd likely want to use the machine learning toolbox. 
Also agree with others, I don't think this is the best approach if you are trying to process alot of numbers. Why do you need it to be done that way? Maybe there is an easier approach if you leave everything in Col B and work with that? 
You could do this with matrices. x = [2 -4 0 0...; 1 -4 1 0 0 ... ; 0 1 -4 1 0 0... ; ...; ..0 0 1 -4 1; ...0 0 0 -5 2] y = [-12;30; 30; 30;30;...;30;-20] xA = y A = inv(x)*y; and then A will be your matrix of solutions
You can use structures var ={a,b}; val = [1.2]; for i =1:numel(var) x.(var[i]) = val[i]; end You could use the eval() function too. 
cell2(1) is a cell from a cell array. Use cell2{1} to get the object from inside the cell. 
This tip should definitely help you out.
I've been struggling with this, too, in the context of defining a large number of constants to use in a Simulink model of a control software I'm developing. I don't want to hard code them in the model, nor do I want them to be buried in a mat file, since I want to use the same table of constants directly in my software requirements. I'm leaning towards using a csv file and the eval command to put them into parameters in the MATLAB workspace that can be natively read by Simulink. 
 Use anonymous functions: u = @(x) 1.0.*(x&gt;=0) F = @(x) 1 - cos(x).*(u(x) - u(x-.5) + sin(x).*u(x-.5) fplot(F) xlim([0 1]) grid on 
you have the right path. Here is the code to show how it is done: clc; clear all; n = 1000; %test number x_test = zeros(n); %creates the x square matrix for iterations y_test = zeros(1, n); %creates the y matrix for i = 1:1000 if i == 1 %setting the first equation x_test(1,1) = 2; x_test(1,2) = 4; y_test(i) = -12; elseif i == 1000 %setting the final equation x_test(n,n-1) = -5; x_test(n,n) = 2; y_test(n) = -20; else % making the pattern x_test(i, i-1) = 1; x_test(i, i) = -4; x_test(i, i+1) = 1; y_test(i) = 30; end end result = y_test/x_test; display(result); When it comes to for loops and manipulating the matrix, look for the pattern.
I like cellfun for things like this. Use it to map a function like @(x)eq(x, cell2{1}) onto each entry contained in cell1. Go to town from there.

Just to put it out there: &gt; https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/string-evaluation.html 
Try step (f)
it would help if you draw it by hand in paint or something and post a picture of said shape.. 
I've used it to provide a mechanism for executing arbitrary code within the context of an already running program. For example, lets say I have a matlab script that shows me live video, but I want to pause it an inspect the contents of a specific subset of pixels, just push my eval button and type what I want to do, which `eval`s the code with access to variables within the program. I think the real answer is that eval is only useful when you need runtime execution of arbitrary code, but even then a plugin architecture might be a little less gross.
it's all on [this doc page\]([https://nl.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/matrix-indexing-in-matlab.html](https://nl.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/matrix-indexing-in-matlab.html). look at the examples near:"Usually the number of elements on the right must be the same as the number of elements referred to by the indexing expression on the left. You can always, however, use a scalar on the right side", and combine that with logical indexing explained further below.
I can't post a picture but it would look like a finger in 2d from the side.
Still doesn't work, same error :(
Perhaps try a [global](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/global.html) variable? However, are you sure you don’t just want your variable to be a function of t? For example, make sure you don’t want “myVar=2*t+1”. Some of MATLAB’s ode solvers are variable step size, so the number of steps might not always be meaningful.
Why not use something like:
Using diag() instead of a for loop (and then directly assigning the first and last rows) will be much more efficient, and end up with the same result. 
I would like the variable to be independent of time ie, i specify each value for it to change too, but just at each new time step the next value is taken 
Have you tried taking the Laplace transform and simulating it with lsim or just a ramp input?
how would I do that? I’ve not got much knowledge in this area unfortunately. 
Do you have the image processing toolbox? I don't have it, but I think there's an easier way to do this with the image processing toolbox. I'll work on a solution without it in the meantime.
I don't know if this is the fastest/best way to do this, but I would use the command [inpolygon](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/inpolygon.html). First you'd have to define the query polygon by taking the points of your line then adding the top corners (to actually inclose a polygon). Then you'd have some code that's something like: `sumIntensities = sum(sum(img(inpolygon(...))))` I left the arguments for inpolygon out because I've only used it a bit and didn't want to steer you wrong, but with a little studying of the documentation you should be fine. If your image isn't grayscale you'll have to do it for all the color channels.
The curves can be any orientation. They do not have to pass the vertical line test. Yes, I have the image processing toolbox
To solve your connecting the boundary to the line problem: Use bwmorph to find the endpoints of the curve. Then find the closest edge to your endpoint. Draw a straight line (up/down/left/right) to that edge by converting all the blacks to white on that row (and you can do this for multiple rows to adjust thickness) Honestly, not really sure what you mean by pixel intensity. Do you mean just if the area is fully white and contains (in this example) 10 pixels, your total intensity is just 2550? 
&gt; First you'd have to define the query polygon by taking the points of your line then adding the top corners (to actually inclose a polygon). And how would you do that?
I'm dealing with grayscale images, so the area in blue for the images I have is not just pure black, unlike in the example I showed. The actual pixels in that region have grayscale values
You can use a while loop to go through the image until you hit the line, then go to the next row until you hit the line, and again, etc. until there are no rows remaining. That being said, someone out there probably has an easier solution using some MATLAB function that already exists
Let's say your x coordinates of the curve are curveX and your ys are curveY. If it's always the top boundary of the image that you're going to be using (like your example images), I would do something like this: `curveX = [curveX(1), curveX, curveX(end)];` `curveY = [0,curveY,0];` That might not be appropriate for all of the curves you need to do this for, but that would work for curves like your example curve. &amp;#x200B;
Should be able to do this using ode45 or any other ode solver
Can you describe to me what you expect to see when you plot x^(1/3) if x &lt; 0?
I'm expecting to see exactly the same as when plotting cbrt(x)
[cbrt](https://octave.sourceforge.io/octave/function/cbrt.html) is an Octave-specific function not in Matlab. When Matlab computes a negative number to a non integer power it's giving you the complex-valued solution.
Ah ok, I see. Well I suppose there would be an equivalent for the cube root function in Matlab? But anyway, how do you plot a function like x^1/5 then? And do you know of a way to do the same in Octave? It's quite confusing to me this outcome
I’ve been trying with ODE45 for a while but because dL depends on X which isnt defined until I get a solution for L I’m at a loss for how to use it
Try running these commands and see if they help you figure out what's going on: x = -3:0.1:3; plot(x, x.^(1/3), x, abs(x.^(1/3)), x, real(x.^(1/3)), x, imag(x.^(1/3))); legend('raw', 'abs', 'real', 'imag')
Did you set the correct StartUpWMClass attribute when writing your .desktop file ?
Yes thank you, but even though I understand there's a difference between the real and imaginary part, I don't understand why real(x.^(1/3)) plots the complex part for x&lt;0, and not what I would expect from the domain of a cube root function. e.g. How could you plot this function : f(x) = x^1/5 ?
Have you looked into bwboundaries()? https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/bwboundaries.html
Yes, I already have
Because the cbrt of a negative number is not a real number. Matlab is returning the correct values which are complex. You want the real solution to x^3 - c = 0 which you can get either by using Matlab's roots function, or by squaring the principal complex root of 1 and then scaling by abs(x)^(1/3). 
So like binning or finding the number of unique instances and than counting based on those instances?
Is it just this one array, or do you need a solution that works for more general applications? If not: tabnew = [tab(1:2), 0, tab(3:4)] 
I have a position variable that is randomly generated so the way you do it will work just fine thanks :)
In DOS, "\\" refers to the root of the current drive. If Matlab translates "/" to "\\", then at least if you're in any subdirectory of C:, "/" should point to "C:\\".
Remember that the cube root of a negative number has multiple solutions. Octave is giving you the principal root, and it sounds like you want the real root. Try using `nthroot()`, or make your own using `abs()` and `sign()`: x = -3:0.1:3; y = x.^(1/5); plot(x, abs(y), x, nthroot(x, 5), x, sign(x).*abs(y))
Oh thank you! Didn't thought of multiplying the absolute for the sign function. nthroot() is also a function I didn't find when looking online, thanks 
I think so. My .desktop file looks like this: [Desktop Entry] Version=1.0 Terminal=false Type=Application Name=MATLAB R2018b Exec=matlab -desktop Icon=/usr/local/MATLAB/R2018b/bin/glnxa64/cef_resources/matlab_icon.png StartupWMClass=MATLAB R2018b - academic use It still shows two icons after launch. Did I miss anything?
You can use fprinf(“Use mesh(X,Y,Z) to plot\n”) to write text to the command line. Is this what you’re looking for?
Since your assignment doesn't specify the mean value and distribution of the random variables, you should be free to set them to whatever you want. In practice, you probably want to use mu=0, sigma=1 to get the standardized normal distribution. Also checkout the "randn()" command. 
Thanks lolol, I think I made it work with the randn command! :)
No, I'm not merely looking to display text. I'm trying to write to the current line without running (as if I had typed after running the function without hitting Enter). Do you understand my examples? The goal is to get a pre-typed suggestion of the next command to run
Ah, you want the equivalent of the “did you mean...” commands? I don’t have a good answer for that. I will do a little digging when I get a chance and let you know if I come up with anything.
I appreciate that!
The [error command](http://matlab.izmiran.ru/help/techdoc/ref/error.html) should do it. 
This may be possible with [try/catch](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/try.html) statements. You are afford the opportunity to see what Matlab thinks is the problem and do some error handling yourself. You could likely use the catch statement to through the error via fprintf or something else.
So i should write assert(functions,error'message') ??
Basically the error command is just like any other command; you place it in an "if" statement, and if the conditions are not met you have an else statement with the error command. The command is used as error('error message to display')
I haven’t found a true solution, but have a workaround solution that should effectively accomplish what you’re looking for. Instead of having it prompt you with the command, you can use the following: function Output=myFun(Input) % do some computations here input(“mesh(X,Y)\n”) mesh(X,Y); end Here, your command window will look as if you are being prompted to run the mesh command. If you want to run it, simply press enter. If you don’t want to run it, you can just press ctrl+c, or you could actually receive some input and give the function a response that tells it whether or not to plot. I realize that this is not exactly what you were looking for, but in terms of number of keystrokes, this should be comparable, since in the true version of what you were looking for, you would either hit enter to run the plot command, or hit ctrl+c or a bunch of back spaces to clear the command.
I would think long and hard about doing this. Is it really necessary for what you're trying to accomplish? The problem with this approach is you will constantly have growing arrays. It's terribly inefficient memory management.
You will need to look at the ode functions on matlab. First thing would be to create a function script. If you click on the down arrow on the new script then you will see it. From there, you replicate T'(t) and it should look like this: function dTdt = therm_coup(~, T) dTdt = -1.27575 * (10^(-10)) * T^4 - T +479.39; end the ~ symbol is replacing time because it is not a factor in the equation. **Now save the function as the same name as the function (IMPORTANT)** Ode compilers in matlab look for the function name to find them. Afterwards, you can create another script with the following: tspan = [0 10]; Temp_0 = 298; [time, results] = ode45(@therm_coup, tspan, Temp_0); plot(time, results) and you will see the same results. I do suggest that you look at the mathworks ode sections to get a better handle on them.
for whatever it's worth: you don't have to do this in separate files. You can define functions in-line. This runs on its own: tspan = [0 10]; % range of time to solve over Temp_0 = 298; % initial temp dTdt = @(t,T) -1.27575 * (10^(-10)) * T^4 - T +479.39; % define the ODE for T(t) [time, results] = ode45(dTdt , tspan, Temp_0); plot(time, results)
That's true. I prefer showing this method because it is easier to figure out what's wrong by keeping the code bite-size.
Nothing wrong with creating variables in a loop. What you don't want to do is have your variables changing size on each iteration. This reduces Matlab efficiency and is generally poor coding practice. Better to pre-assign variables outside of the loop to their expected sizes. With the above in mind... For most applications where people are just learning, like with smallish loops and variables, you won't really notice the performance hit doing what you've suggested. If your problem follows.some kind of obvious pattern, you could probably do the whole thing without a loop, though.
It is horrible to create variables in a loop. 
Are all the V_n the same size? If so, you want a 3D array, so you'd index it V(a, b, n) as opposed to V_n(a, b). If not, you want a cell array, so V_n is stored in V{n}. 
Yeah they’re all the same size, that’s a great idea! Didn’t know you could do that, thanks!
To add to this, if you dont know the size of the iterative results (or they change), using cell arrays is a good choice, since (iirc) the individual elements of a cell array are inherently stored separately in memory. Expanding the cell array would still have a (minor) hit, as would expanding an array in a given cell, but not for assigning whole new arrays to (preferably preallocated) cells in the cell array.
If the arrays are all the same size and you only need the previous one, you can do V0=&lt;...&gt; Vcur=f(V0) for nn=[1:t] V0=Vcur Vcur=f(V0); end 
&gt; what are some widely-held "justified" uses of eval? IDK about the "widely-help" part, but one justified use of eval ive found is "dealing with situations where, for whatever reason, you cant know the name of a variable you need to use ahead of time". This is a unusual situation, but `eval` is afaik the *only* way to solve it. (if your familiar with bash, this is sort of like using `$(eval echo \$$varname)` to refer to the variable whose name is `$varname`, i.e. the value of variable `varname`) FYI - if you want "semi-global" variables you can use nested functions. function fun0(...) x=... y=... fun1 function fun1 x=fx(...) y=fy(...) end end In the above code, x and y will be shared between the main function and the nested one, but arent shared with anything outside of the main function.
stack all the data you want plotted into a 3D array (call it `Z`) of size `[201 x 201 x n]`, then do ff=figure; fa=gca; for nn=[1:size(Z,3)] if nn == 1 surfc(fa,Xp,Yp,Z(:,:,nn)); title(fa,...); axes(fa,...); % etc. set up how you want the figure to look here else fa.CData=Z(:,:,nn); fa.ZData=Z(:,:,nn); end pause(1) end if you cant get something like that to work you can just do ff=figure fa=gca for nn=[1:size(Z,3)] surfc(fa,Xp,Yp,Z(:,:,nn)); pause(1) end But youll have a lot more overhead since you regerate the entire figure each iteration instead of just updating the data part of it
Try meshgrid https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/meshgrid.html Been a while since I’ve done this but I think this is a pretty straightforward way if I’m remembering right. 
I appreciate your help, thank you!
Have a large array is terrible memory management? 
I didn't say having a large array is terrible memory management, I said a growing array is. Arrays should be pre-allocated, if possible. Many times you can do math to predict the resulting array size - but I understand sometimes it is unpredictable.
Because you're doing matrix multiplication of the matrix cosh(x) and the matrix sin(y). You need the piece-wise multiplication operator .\*
Ah, the whole "everything is an array" thing in Matlab strikes again. It's taking me a while to get used to that.
I don't see anything that says M and N need to be the same, e.g. you could have 10 numbers between 1 and 100.
The instructions on a later portion of the project say that M and N have to be 10 in just curious if I’m filling them properly. 
The 'surf' command doesn't work by just taking x, y, and z data -- it requires a full array for z data. Go look at some examples in the surf documentation
Let's assume M=N=10 as you say. x is not a vector that goes from 1 to 10, it's a vector of 10 elements, where each element could be between 1 and 10. So you may have repeated values depending on what the RNG comes up with. I think your main function should contain something like: x = randi(M,N,1); x2 = sortfunction(x); plot(x2)
More precisely, your code generate data only for a slice of the surface. You could plot this 3d slice using plot3(x, y, z) To plot the surface you need to generate a matrix Z with that provide the altitude for each sampled x and y. You can use meshgrid function to generate easily the x and y data for that or alternatively you can use to loops: X=linspace(0,10,100); Y=linspace(0,58,101); for i=1:length(X) for j=1:length(Y) Z(j, i) =X(i)*Y(j) whatever you want end end Surf(X, Y, Z) 
Please do not share your code as screenshots. Use pastebin or a similar site. This way people can easily run your code if they need to. 
Sorry, figuring this out is part of the exercise. \-Patrick
randomVariables' class is a struct whereas stepwiselm expects a table.
Your interpretation is correct. It's asking you to generate N random numbers.
Not everything is an array in Matlab.
Matlab version? Have you tried an older version?
Hey man, thanks for the reply! Nope. Would that make a difference? Let me try later.
The oldest MATLAB version that supports Ubuntu 18.04 is R2018b. I actually had R2018a on my Ubuntu 18.04 initially and it has some issues that were remedied after upgrading to R2018b. If there is an issue with the downloader, I highly recommend the original poster download the .iso first, perform a cheksum and then install it from a mount. You can retrieve the .iso from the admin of the your institutional account. Though at first, the admin might think it's a bit odd for such a request and may need to do a minute or two of digging to find the links. Unfortunately even with an active license and Mathworks account, you can't download the offline installer from the website, officially, unless you're the account admin.
The **end** of your **for** loop is in the wrong location.
Thank you! I was losing my mind over this.
Thanks for the tip, it's always good to know alternate approaches.
Are you running the installer as root? I remember needing to go to the command line and run the installer script with sudo. 
Bingo. I think contacting the licensing admin is waaaaaaaay harder than solving the installer issue. Thanks for the input by the way!
Yeap I was running sudo with root access :)
Not clear what you're Matlab question is here, but if you're looking for an FFT explainer I really like the one on simplyexplained.com
Wrapping a complex output in real() or abs() will return only the real-valued part 
I believe your main problem is with lines 31 - 34: func=@(x) abs(F(1))/32; for i = 1:length(C) func =@(x) func(x)+C(i)*cos(W(i)*x+P(i)); end It is not doing at all what you think it is doing. Look at the output of func in the Command Window, and it will show you that func is NOT a recreation of the original signal using the most powerful harmonics. I would recommend doing everything numerically instead; something like... signal = abs(F(1))/32 * ones(size(x)); for i = 1:length(C) signal = signal + C(i)*cos(W(i)*x+P(i)); end

There are a few ways, but id use a structure as a lookup table. You can do it via something like this. foods=struct; foods.egg=[1 2 3 4]; foods.banana=[2 4 6 8]; userIn=input('input a food: ','s'); if any(cellfun(@(x)strcmp(x,lower(userIn)),fields(foods))) value=foods.(lower(userIn)); else fprintf('input not recognized!') value=NaN; end 
This should work. Thanks for your response.
Heh, I suppose it's not exactly a Matlab question. It is more of a question for mathematics, but I figured asking /r/Matlab would make sense, seeing as I'm computing everything with Matlab. &amp;#x200B; I'll check out betterexplained. Thanks!
Thanks. I'll have a look at the differences at test it!
Heh, yes I know that the func isn't doing what I want it to, and when I see the plot I can see that it's not matching up with the original data at all. Another user pointed out that there was some oddball stuff with the way I assigned frequencies and stuff. Thanks for looking at it!
Could use the "containers.Map" datatype. It is similar to the 'dict' in Python. Basically, this datatype lets you create an array of values, where the index is not a number, but a text string. In the case of your example, it would look something like: M = containers.Map(); % Make the "Map" object, and call it M M('egg') = [6 5 0.6 78]; % Adding values to the map M('avocado') = [2 8 1 65]; % I made up these values disp(M('egg')); % Fetch the values for 'egg' and display them disp(keys(M)); % List all the keys saved in M (would output 'egg' 'avocado') One advantage of this, is that you can easily get a list of all the food items stored in the map (using the "keys" function). This is helpful if you wanted to loop through all the foods (if you wanted to make a "master list" of all your nutrition information). &amp;#x200B;
This is either a super passive aggressive comment on people not responding in a timely manner, or a reply that was mistakenly typed independently of the parent comment
The latter! 
I do want to make a master list where I can easily add new foods. This will work great. Thanks for the help. 
Why doesn't it work? What error do you get? Matlab has excellent support for break points. Place a breakpoint where your code "fail" and see what happens. A good start is to place a breakpoint at the "while"-row. Check the variables "square", "r" and "c" manually. Do they look as you would expect? 
I dont get any error, but for example I enter a 2x2 matrix and it gives no warning.
What do "square", "r" and "c" look like when you set a breakpoint?
What is a breakpoint? Is it the point where an error shows? Cause I'm not getting any error. But I noticed that everytime the entered matrix has 4 in both or one of its dimensions, the loop ends. I find that strange cause I'm using &amp;&amp;, so why should it accept a 3x4? 
You can use a website called google to find the answer to questions: https://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/set-breakpoints.html ;) You seem to have identified that there's something wrong with your condition "r ~= 4 &amp;&amp; c ~= 4". Try to run it in the terminal for different values of "r" and "c" and see what the results. 
Ahh. Apparently I have to use OR instead of AND. Thanks for the guidance! 
You are a life saver, thank you so much
I have tried but without success, do not know hot to do the loop and it does not work, please help. &amp;#x200B; myDir = uigetdir; % Gets directory myFiles = dir(fullfile(myDir,'\*.txt')); % Gets all txt files in struct &amp;#x200B; for k = 1:length(myFiles) baseFileName = myFiles(k).name; fullFileName = fullfile(myDir, baseFileName); num = load(fullFileName); save( test, fullFileName) end &amp;#x200B; File names are: xxx\_20170104\_yyy.txt xxx\_20170108\_yyy.txt xxx\_20170115\_yyy.txt xxx\_20170119\_yyy.txt &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Check out the text() function
Think about what you're writing in the second versus first example. Isempty aside, do they have the same structure?
Also, it's poor practice to name your variables "range".
Its not a numerical artifact. the root finder should be trusted here. I'm not sure what dynamics you are referring to. Maybe it would help if you explain what are you expecting to see here and in what way is the animation different? 
Look up de Morgan's laws if you want to learn more about identities in Boolean logic.
X-post to [/r/chaos](https://www.reddit.com/r/chaos/comments/azh1w6/roots_of_expx_taylor_polynomials/) 
Thanks for your insight. The fact that the canonical form is I’ll conditioned is new to me. I expected to see a convergent trend, but the behavior I am observing looks chaotic starting at about 30 iterations. 
Your function is supposed to be generating estimated values for your raw data. What would it even mean for those to be different sizes? 
I'm a bit confused as to your question. What do you mean by sizes? 
The size of a variable is the output of size(). It's the number of rows and columns of elements in the array. If you're trying to fit a function to some data, then you'd expect the output of the function to have the same number of elements as that data, right? 
Yes. So the values the function gives out should have both x and y values (and I assume 6 of them since I have 6 data points). 
What type of data is returned by input()? 
&gt; looks chaotic starting at about 30 iterations. &gt; ` p(i+1) = 1 / factorial(i)` You used the entire `p` vector and keep making the last value smaller, which continually increases the dynamic range. at i=30, 1/factorial(30) is around 10^-32, which is basically `eps^2`. The underlying algorithm probably requires, at the least, the square root of the ratio of the largest and smallest coefficients to be less than numeric epsilon, which isnt true for `i&gt;30`
Do you have a wiring diagram for that already? I'm not sure people here know exactly what you're trying to accomplish? Maybe check out an electrical engineering sub as well?
So the error comes from the save command. Variables need to be in single quotes. A corrected version of the code is below: ​ myDir = uigetdir; % Gets directory myFiles = dir(fullfile(myDir,'\*.txt')); % Gets all txt files in struct for k = 1:length(myFiles) baseFileName = myFiles(k).name; % Separate the name and the extension \[\~,fileName,fileExtension\] = fileparts(baseFileName); fullFileName = fullfile(myDir, baseFileName); num = load(fullFileName); % Put together name and new extension newFileName = \[fileName '.mat'\]; % Save needs the variable name in single quotes save( newFileName, 'num'); end 
Sorry dude, but this is pretty big. I would start with the main while loop: * Make the displayBoard() function. * Make a function that makes random moves. Ignore flipping and checking legality for now. When you get this going, you can move on to legality, user input and flipping. 
 [McGrilled](https://www.reddit.com/user/McGrilled) Your code works! Thanks I just started to build something but stacked at last stage in loop, how to load files and save it, thanks again. %% This is working example files = dir('\*.txt'); for i = 1:numel(files) numberStr = regexp (files(i).name,'xxx\_(\\d\*).txt','tokens'); numberStr = numberStr{1}; number(i) = str2double(numberStr); end &amp;#x200B;
How to incorporate all, instead of saving like in [McGrilled](https://www.reddit.com/user/McGrilled) code "xxx\_20170104.mat" save all files in format "data\_20170104.mat"
Thats a great explanation.
Modify the string "fileName".
 &gt;SOLVED: &gt; &gt;This is why I hate programming/code etc. My problem was my data set and my 3rd line were missing ; at the end of it. No that almost certainly was not the problem. 
That appears to be the problem. I have been able to properly run my function and get a proper fit. Considering that was the only thing I changed, and now everything runs smoothly. I don't see what else it could have been. 
 a = [1 2; 3 4]; i = 1; while i &lt;= numel(a) disp(a(i)); end Something like that? 
Well the only functions I can use is length/input /size. Let say the matrix is 5x1. A = [1;2;3;4;5] 
Well the only functions I can use is length/input /size. Let say the matrix is 5x1. A = [1;2;3;4;5] 
I am not sure that I understood your question very well, but you might find something interesting if you Google "logical indexing". If that does not help please provide a more accurate description of the problem. 
Its an "educated guess" more than an explaination lol, but it makes sense. It also explains why it eventually starts to stagnate - at some point rather than running an inaccurate calculation new inputs are all rounding down to 0. Id guess most of the "wiggling" at the i&gt;100 iterations is just numeric artifacts from re-running the same input (plus 0) over and over again. idk if it is compatible with `roots` or not, but you might be able to get past this (for a little bit, idk about all the way up to i=200) using `vpa`. warning: vpa is going to be slow. really slow. Running it once is one thing, but if youll need to do this many times id look for a different solution./
try running `sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/MATLAB; sudo chown $USER:$USER /usr/local/MATLAB` and then try installing as your normal (non-root) user
The first issue is how you are initializing the scoreboard struct in Line 14. Take a look at the examples here: [https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/struct.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/struct.html) HINT: What are the field names for scoreboard?
I used player name and score as fields
It's fine, don't worry about it 
Good luck.
Ahh now I understand. This is a fairly common misconception I think. The problem is that the Taylor series for exp converges uniformly (at least on compact subsets of R) to the values of exp(x) but this does NOT mean it preserves any other properties. The roots of the n^th Taylor polynomial don't necessarily have anything to do with the (n+1)^st. Maybe an obvious way to see this is to note that exp(x) has exactly 0 roots but if T_n is the n^th Taylor polynomial, then T_n has n roots (and generically these are distinct). So while T_n ---&gt; exp pointwise for all x, their number of roots could not be more different. 
You can access any matrix input using a single index. So i=1; while i&lt;=size(A, 1)*size(A,2) disp(A(i)) ; i=i+1; end
This is actually what got me interested in investigating this problem in the first place. A polynomial of degree n has n roots. For something like sin(x) it makes sense that the series approximation, a polynomial of infinite degree will have infinitely many roots. So, I was curious about the dynamics of the roots in the case of exp(x) which has no roots. What I saw in my simulations seemed to say more about eig and finite precision arithmetic than it did about the problem I was interested in. 
Do it manually to turn off the balancing p = [1]; for i = 1:200 p(i+1) = 1 / factorial(i); z = eig(compan(p), 'nobalance'); plot(real(z), imag(z), 'o') drawnow end 
It sounds like you want to use the "sort" function. From the documentation, you can pass out the indices of the sorted array in terms of the original array. Look at the description of the output argument "I": https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/sort.html#bt8nojg-4 x = [1 3 5 4 2 6 7]; y = ['a'; 'c'; 'e'; 'd'; 'b'; 'f'; 'g']; [x2, I] = sort(x) y2 = y(I)
Unfortunately, I can’t use any built in functions to do this... any other way you know of?
If it were me, I would probably just write my own sorting algorithm with a similar syntax to the built-in (a.k.a. [x2, I] = mySort(x)). Bubble-sort is a fairly straightforward sorting algorithm to implement (though it's not always the fastest). Take a look at some of the GIFs and the pseudocode on the Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort To construct "I": 1. Initialize I to be 1:length(x) % [1 2 3 ... n] 2. Whenever you swap x(i) and x(i), also swap I(i) and I(j)
Unfortunately, I’m not allowed to do that either... I’m just gonna use sort anyway and see if it’ll get me partial credit at least. This is due at midnight so I don’t have much time to sit here and learn other ways to do it
Have you tried sorting the ASCII codes for each character? You could use the double() functions (on mobile, sorry for formatting): double('A')=65; double('B')=66, etc That should work if you know all the characters will be upper/lowercase.
Then what are you allowed to do? How do you expect help when you don't tell us basics of what you can and can't do?
I already mentioned above that I’m not allowed to use any of MATLAB’s built in functions.
So he showed you how to write your own...
fprintf
disp()
Can you explain how I would do this? I’ve only been using matlab for this semester so I’m still very new.
I tried to use disp(‘...’) but when I did it just displayed the statement with the variable names instead of their values. Is there a way to display the values as opposed to the names?
For your problem, you should use fprintf("") just like in C language. `fprintf('The highest point of the mountain is : %d feet.\n', hp);` Here, hp is the variable name and "%d" is the formatter indicating that it is an integer. 
So I would format all of the variables in the statement in this way?
Yes, you can use multiple identifers in the string, %d for double, %s for string, and others. There are modifiers to change alignment, number of decimal places, etc. Read the examples in the documentation page for fprintf and also look at the formatSpec examples toward the bottom.
"Hey let me post on reddit so someone can figure out my homework for me...oh yeah it's due tonight." Sorting algorithms are literally the easiest functions to write if you put any effort in. 
I mean, the only reason I posted was because the ways I tried failed. And this is the first semester I’ve used MATLAB. I’m not inclined to coding, and it takes me some time to figure stuff like this out. The only reason I came here was because I had a Calc test 2 days ago and was only able to start on Saturday.
I'm sure you could find a YouTube video on this 
I mean, normally I just try to find stuff like this on the MathWorks website, but all the solutions they gave used the function “sort” which I wouldn’t be able to use...a
%d is for integers FYI. But to OP just read the mathworks documentation clearly and it highlights examples and the correct use cases. https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fprintf.html
matlab image processing documentations, or try the app they design, generate code after you done
At university we analysed images of coins to count the amount....? Depends how big you are thinking.
Read the documentation for it. 
Wait, you mean inside your definition of `Data`? Oh, yeah okay that makes sense. Now I see it. How did you expect to index `Data(:, 1)` and `Data(:, 2)` without making 2 columns in `Data` in the first place? And why even bother creating `Data` when you immediately split it apart into `t` and `y`? This is what I'm talking about. It's clear from your code that you aren't thinking about what you want to achieve. You're writing things you've seen before and hoping they just happen to give you what you want. Think about what process steps need to happen to get you what you want, then write code that does those things. If you don't know how to express yourself in the language, check the documentation to clarify. 
Depends on what your goals are and how many experience you have. &amp;#x200B; I would suggest you to take some pics of something and try to extract it. For example, coins, try and take some pics of coins with different backgrounds, different angles, lights, etc. Than go an try to segment them all, count them and if you want to go next level, count the total value...
Just use a name-value pair to set the Stop Time to whatever you want. E.g.: sim(modelName, 'StopTime', 120)
You can make a script that count the amount of geometrical shapes in one picture based on the contrast.
you can set the value of the time to a variable, then set the value of the variable in a startup script.
https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fprintf.html
Data is in 2 columns. Data is literally where my data is in, I split it into t and y because that's what my function is fitting. And I don't know the language, or how to use matlab. I'm learning as I go basically. 
Not for your problem specifically, but in general MATLAB has a help command. help YourCommandHere This has SO much info, and has helped me tons over the years.
First, welcome to the subreddit and the process of learning Matlab. I hope you're able to find the help you need here. For your initial problem, can you post your code? The ordering of those commands should not matter, as long as you call them after the axis is created (i.e., after you call `plot` or `bar` or `scatter` or some other plotting command). Generally speaking it will be easiest to get help if you share the code you've written so far, and especially for debugging, it's important to share the code so that others can reproduce and diagnose the issue.
If you used a code through say an educational institution, it may be outdated. If so your school probably has a new one in the same place you found the first one.
Thanks. Ive already edited the code but I appreciate the advice. I will edit the post when I get home with the code.
Thanks. Appreciate the help. Huge learning curve for me.
MathWorks provides installation support if you have valid license. Might be worth it to reach out here https://www.mathworks.com/support/contact_us.html
In AutoCAD, you can use the polygon command to create a shape of n sides. It does this by circumscribing it inside of a circle with n points equally spaced and lines drawn between adjacent points. I'd start by using this sort of logic
Thank you, will trt using this
This procedure actually comes from an even older algorithm, in the times of Euclid there were procedures/proof for constructing regular polygons.
Awesome! Definitely gonna try this out.
There is also the doc command, which opens the (html) documentation in another windows. The documentation usually contains more information than the help command, and tons of examples. Also includes a search bar if you are looking for something but don't know the command. Press F1 when the cursor is on the command that interest you, or type in the command window: doc myCommand 
Thank you guys for your replies! It turned out to be a small syntax error that took all day to discover 
There is no function that will do that for you. You have to write that function. That's the assignment. 
since it is just a warning you can most likely ignore it unless your final results are bad, but the warning basically just tells you that there are values in the matrix that are within the area of a numerical error, in the case of a convergence this happens a lot, and sometimes you might just want to suppress the warning
How would you install matlab in the raspberry ? 
Thanks for the great info, will dig into it more when I get a chance!
have you tried this page?: &amp;#x200B; [https://www.google.com/search?q=rotate+image+in+matlab&amp;oq=rotate+image+in+matlab&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3487j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8](https://www.google.com/search?q=rotate+image+in+matlab&amp;oq=rotate+image+in+matlab&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3487j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)
i'm not looking to rotate the *image* but the data.
I thought your data is an image.. Now i'm confused. If i try my best to understand your problem imrotate still is (part of) the solution. Have you tried it?
No need to be confused at all. That's why I said in the title I'm looking to rotate the data. After that I want to view the corresponding image. I have tried it and it isn't what I'm looking for. No problem if either I'm not explaining this well or if you aren't following me. 
1) Your engineering problem sounds outside the purview of MATLAB knowledge. 2) Your matrix is poorly conditioned. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_number 3) We can't read your code. You could at least go to the line that the warning references and paste relevant sections of the code for us.
I didnt look through all the code, but id imagine the functioin call throwing that warning is a matrix inversion (probably via left/right matrix division to solve a linear system). Youll want to change A \ B into pinv(A) * B `pinv` does exactly what you want - ignores any singular values below some threshold so they dont de-stabalize the matrix inversion. Its a bit slower, but shouls be much more stable
Are you actually solving a linear system? Or is this occurring internally to some ode solving algorithm? You have removed the line numbers from the error message, and I'm not going to read through 500 lines of code. Either way this often means some of your variables are taking on values near the limit of machine precision. Typically, heavy duty modeling tasks like this are done in unit systems chosen to avoid very large or very small values. If you're expressing something in meters but have values of 10^-9 m, consider converting your calculations (and associated physical constants, etc.) to us nanometers, for example. Ideally, everything would have values on the order of 1.
It would greatly help to know what line you get the warning on. My experience with this warning is that it becomes very apparent when you actually inspect the matrix that's being solved. If you enter the debugger, just before the offending line, you can look at the values being input, and it may become obvious what the warning is about. A couple possibilities: \- badly scaled: Equations of vastly different orders of magnitude can be tough to solve. This can sometimes be resolved by normalizing the equations. An example would be: 1e21x + 2e22y = 4e21; 2e-20x + 1e-20y = 6e-20. The above can be reexpressed as: 1x + 20y = 4; 2x + 1y = 6. \- overlapping or nearly overlapping equations: sometimes some of your equations actually reduce to the same value or nearly similar value. An example would be 1x + 2y = 4; 2x + 4y = 8.00000000001. The above can technically be solved, but is very suspect - the second equation may accidentally be a rewritten form of the first with some numerical error, for example. In the above case, you should look for a new second equation that is independent of the first. \- straight up error: Sometimes we screw up our inputs and fail to set something as we thought we had. This is often easiest to do when you have a sparse matrix and you miss a row/column. An example: 1x + 2y = 4; 0x +0y = 0; The second equation above is an example where the coefficients weren't set for some reason. The equations thus cannot be solved.
What some people are neglecting here is that using `disp` with multiple parts in the string requires they be put in as an array. Example: if you want it to say 'He is X years old', you would NOT use `disp('He is ', num2str(X), ' years old')` but rather `disp(['He is ', num2str(X), ' years old'])`
A vector element can only hold one number, or one character. You could use a cell array to hold three different strings
oduncu{1}='ali'; oduncu{2}='veli'; oduncu{3}='deli'; for i=1:3 scoreboard(struct(oduncu{i},num2str(....
Thanks a lot for your answers
I mean, if you think about it, a regular polygon is just a bunch of equidistant dots on a circle. Just figure out how much angle you need based on the number of signs and just plot location based on &lt;cos theta, sin theta&gt; * radius of the polygon. And boom.
Looks like there's a dimension mismatch in your subscripted assignment. No surprise, since you're assigning a 3-element array to a single element of another array. 
I am new on matlab but I got it thank you 
I'm still kind of new with matlab, but it would probably be easier to do this with a different language. Matlab is slow at many tasks and has a limited library list compared to more popular languages. Even though effects can be added as you mentioned, can they be done in real time with low enough latency on such a low power device? Also, does matlab have raspberry pi support at all? If you understand how to do it in matlab it shouldn't be difficult to pick up the syntax of another language like c or java, and apply your idea to them. 
You don't install MATLAB on a RasPi, rather you use **MATLAB Coder** to generate C code from MATLAB code and deploy it as standalone application on a RasPi. Simulink also has similar solution. Some links for reference: - https://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/raspberry-pi-matlab-coder.html - https://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/raspberry-pi-matlab.html - https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/raspberry-pi-programming-matlab-simulink.html 
I know, but I wanted some advice or idea in order to create it for the assignment
This is the right answer if you insist on doing this with MATLAB. I would recommend just doing it in C or C++ if you have the coding chops for that. If you are not familiar with using compilers, makefiles, etc. then MATLAB code generators are probably the way to go, especially if you have significant time constraints.

I'm not sure but i think that if you import them as a column vectors ( one for every variable) you can just plot it the normal way I don't mean 20000 vectors, one for the x axis and one for y
Can you give a snippet (like 5x5 points) of your .txt file?). Reading a .txt file depends a lot on the syntax in the .txt file
I can right click and open in Excel and see numbers in Row 1 to 3000 and Column A to DPJ (I think this is just how the lab equipment saves the data). with each cell having numbers. Is that what you're asking? 
We just want to see an example of how the data is written in the file. Just because it's a text file doesn't mean we know how to import it. If you can just post a little screenshot that shows a small sample set of the data written in the file that can help someone here write an import script. 
Oh got it. Like this? https://imgur.com/JrEz4qp
Yes I wasn't sure if Matlab was even the best way to do this - guess I was just trying to skip a few steps since I had an idea of how to do some effects in it already. If it's best to go down the C/C++ route I wonder would an Arduino be a better suit than the Pi, since I've heard Arduino is based on that? Guess it doesn't matter really. Thanks for the help, will definitely look into these! 
What were you taught in class about doing this? 
Um... At the moment we're being taught numerical differentiation.
Okay, great, that's exactly what this requires! So what have you learned about it? How would you get a derivative from data like this? 
Basically these two formulas https://i.gyazo.com/cd6701a67b8a91ac94fea51616fbfe11.png . I can't understand how to do it, if I knew the function I could but... I'm just clueless what to do here
Same thing applies to Arduino: - https://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/arduino-matlab.html - https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/arduino-programming-matlab-simulink.html - https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/242924-arduino-support-from-matlab-and-simulink-across-releases 
There is a function to obtain epsilon built in to Matlab. You will find it easily when you search the documentation. 
Here's a little snippet of the .txt file: [https://imgur.com/JrEz4qp](https://imgur.com/JrEz4qp). Is that what you're looking for? &amp;#x200B;
You gotta remember, the definition of a derivative is just the slope of a tangent line. So if you have a curvy function like x^2 you slap a tangent line at the point you care about and get its slope. [See this image for example](https://www.dummies.com/wp-content/uploads/504533.image0.png) But sometimes someone gives you a bunch of x/y coordinates instead of a function. Then you have to get a little creative and pretend you had a function. In some ways it can be misleading to call it a derivative, because really you're just looking for the slope. There may be more than one correct answer for the slope, but I'm not going to complicate this for you.
You'd likely want to start by parsing the Hue, Saturation, and Value generated from rgb2hsv. If the color of interest is blue, Value may be weighted more towards blue than red or green. It is likely you could simply flatten the image to only the blue components of the hsv data.
Given: &gt;&gt; P = py.tuple({py.list({py.list({1,3}), py.list({2,5}), py.list({4,6})})}) P = Python tuple with no properties. ([[1.0, 3.0], [2.0, 5.0], [4.0, 6.0]],) You can extract the data using: P1 = cellfun(@(x) cell2mat(cell(x)), cell(P{1}), 'Uniform',false); P1 = vertcat(P1{:}); same thing for `Q`. 
What do you mean by flatten the image and how would I go about that? 
It depends entirely on what you are doing.
What is a case that i-9990 is better than i9-7940 and what will be the other case? 
This is completely wrong. The warning means the smallest singular value of the matrix is nearly 0. This is far from a harmless warning since it essentially means (among other things) that if you solve the equation Ax = b for any b, then the solution, x, will be approximately as accurate as a solution obtained by randomly writing down any vector (i.e. the solution is completely worthless).
I tried formatting this one my phone to no avail, I guess my first question is how do I effectively show people my code?
Right. You can pull only the blue values from the HSV dataset. And use that matrix to search for your wrinkles. At each x-y pairing of your HSV data you should be able to grab a variety of data from the [HSV array](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/rgb2hsv.html#d120e1064974).
When you write code that has a lot of parallel code. If you're worried about performance that much, then matlab is the wrong language for you.
Have you defined conditions already? In the code you provided, you call conditions before it is defined. Also, in your loop, you’re comparing the full array of conditions in each step, rather than a single element of conditions. 
Agreed! My professor works on project Euler problems in his free time and he found that python runs on average 4 times faster than matlab for an identical task.
Excellent thanks for this. I looked through that documentation but I guess i missed the information i needed.
I think you meant to type T(i) in your anonymous function z.
take a look at Amdahl's Law to get the theoretical answer. &amp;#x200B; practically and speaking from experience, it REALLY depends on what you're doing. loops with "quick" iterations have a tendency to be slower when using parfor due to the overhead it introduces. an example of this is something like: &amp;#x200B; parfor k = 1:100 rand; end &amp;#x200B; alternatively, if the loops contain "long" iterations, you can get much closer to the 1/n theoretical speedup. &amp;#x200B; the Instructions Per Cycle (IPC) probably comes into play too when comparing the two CPUs. unfortunately there's no universal answer to this question since it really comes down to what types of work you're doing. some types of operations favor single core performance, while others can take advantage of multiple cores. &amp;#x200B;
Ah a fellow student with Dr. benson I see?
I'm also interested in how you would properly import this as I had to manipulate data in a similarly formatted txt file with matlab before. I think there's a bit extra to it in this case because the data is separated by spaces instead of commas. This is definitely **not** the "right" way to do it but what I did for my data was open the file in notepad++ and use find/replaced to replace each clusters of spaces with a single comma using regular expressions. Then I imported the "cleaned-up" data to matlab with *uigetfile(".txt)*. Problem is uigetfile is for importing each file one-by-one and requires manual input as you have to choose which file to import each time. Alternatively, you could write a program to properly format each file for you, while also outputting the surface plots. Looking at what others have had to say on the mathworks forums, seems that you'll need to create a for loop to import each file one-by-one. So each loop would import a new file and outputting a plot, while the loops runs for 1 to "number of files." [forum post](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/326541-multiple-txt-input-files) As for the surface plots I'm not sure how you'd go about doing them (so far I've only needed to make 2-D plots). [This](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/visualize/representing-a-matrix-as-a-surface.html) might help you get started. P.S.: Sorry about the run-on sentences.
Thanks for this suggestion, I got the furthest with this technique. Still only gets to about 70 terms but the trend is clearer. Here's an update https://imgur.com/a/ahhRiqq

yup, i figured it out tho
Well in the case of a system where you solve the equation Ax=b it would be bad but if you solve an equation iteratively with a check of a convergence criteria where you essentially want to things to cancel out totally, I’ve been able to ignore this warning many times while still having adequate results. I did not read all his code, but solving heat equations and such can often give that warning... the singular warning can be thrown out from any matrix with close to singular values.
python would also be the wrong choice. Once you start running into matlab's performance limitations, c/c++/fortran are all two orders+ of magnitude faster. Hence why you very rarely see python or matlab code running on a cluster, it's just wasting valuable supercomputer time. &amp;#x200B; On the python vs matlab performance thing, it was certainly true four years ago, it's increasingly less true these days. They're about comparable depending on what you're doing, and how bad your matlab code is. The new JIT backend is pretty magic
You might be able to get a bit more by [manually specifying a higher precision](https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/vpa.html#buyr1k6-1) By default vpa uses 32 digits + some extra to prevent roundoff error, so effective maybe 40-ish. 70! is around 1e100, if you assume the same dependence on `sqrt(largest/smallest)` and assume that it takes a few iterations for the errors to "build up" enough to see, then iteration 70 is pretty close to where id expect running into numerical limits with vpa using default vpa precision.
something like \[firstvarname, secondvarname, thirdvarname, blah, blah, blah\] = importdata('filename.txt','\\t',8) would work, where '\\t' says the columns are tab delimited, and the 8 tells it to skip the first 8 lines where you've got your header. &amp;#x200B; Try it out and see how you go. If I were you, and there's really that much data, import it all once, and then export it all as a .mat (hdf5). Loading the mat each time you need to reload will be a lot faster and less error prone than reimporting from the text files each time
If you can vectorize your code to implement the parallel stuff using matrix operations (and NOT using the parallel toolbox) the i9-7940 will blow away an i9-9900. Otherwise it depends. Source: have an i9-7940x. Have recorded ~4 TFKLOPS on largescale matrix opsd (based on O(N^3) operations - in reality its doing fewer computations due to algorithmic trickery, but is still probably &gt;90% its theoredical peak of just under 3.4/1/7 TFLOPS single/double precision compute)
Are displaying an HSV image as RGB? So the blue in that image represents areas of high V? 
First of all, if your code breaks if they input an odd number, I would suggest changing the text to "input the number of trials". Say that number is n. Then just set n=2n. Now for random allocation. You need to consider if you need the exact same amount of 1s as 0s. If not, use something like randi(2,n)-1. If so, then I suggest a vector of equal number of 1,s and 0s, then create a vector of random numbers from any continuous distibution, then order the first by the sorted index values of the second. 
Whilst sounding like a cunt this bloke isn't wrong .
Well I'm sorry you feel that way, I certainly wasnt trying to be abrasive. Just answered the question honestly in context, based on my experience. What in particular did I say you found offensive?
I didn't find any of it offensive, I just thought you came across like a person with very low social skills. That part is irrelevant though your point was correct.
Not to worry, hurling insults just cause you feel like it makes you sound very high functioning in that department
Sorry it was an observation, if it offended you then I suppose that's on you.
Check out the colorThresholder app. It’s designed exactly for exploring this problem.
Try this: uniqueIds = unique(array(4, :)); for i = uniqueIds plot(array(1, array(4, :) == i), array(2, array(4, :) == i)); hold in end 
As others have said Python isn't any better in terms of performance. Also, Project Euler problems don't require highly performant code to get correct, it requires good algorithm design.
What do you mean by "JIT backend is pretty magic?" &amp;#x200B;
Impressive. What do you mean by "NOT using the parallel toolbox "? &amp;#x200B;
mathworks have replaced their entire backend execution engine in the last couple of years. JIT means just in time compilation, in effect in the background these days, the execution compiles your code just before it is needed to run to something vaguely higher performance. This is still nowhere near as good as truly compiled languages, but it's resulted in about 2x or 3x speedups for a lot of real world code, it's pretty great. Fairly similar to what pypy does for python code, but the speedups mathworks have achieved seem to be higher, at least for my test codes. &amp;#x200B;
Even with 16gigs of ram, it's not like Matlab can access it all. Your OS alone is probably stealing a couple of gigs. I suspect this is less of a Matlab issue and more of a configuration issue? Could it be how your pagefile system in windows is setup versus his, i.e. windows allocates a certain portion of your hard drive as a bit of a cache or "very slow ram"? I'm just spitballing know this one, but maybe the reason your colleague would have it setup already and you don't is because you've always had more real ram?
I have been having memory problems with Matlab for as long as I can remember. &amp;#x200B; Nevertheless type &gt;&gt;memory&lt;&lt; in the console and show what you and your partner get
Matlab's parallel computing toolbox is not very efficient. Matlab simply doesnt have the requisite tools to parallelize somethiing from scratch. Using a natively parallelized function (things like `fft`, `conv`, matrix multiplication) will always be faster. To give an idea of just how much faster matrix mutlipcation is, i wrote up a little something that replicates a matrix multiply with serial/parallel for loops. Granted I never (almost) use the parallel toolbox so these can likely be improved on a bit, but absolute best case scenario itll be linear speedup (w/ number workers) relative to the single threaded case, and likely youll only get half that, maybe (at most on a few special problems) 60-70%, due to parpool overhead. clear all pp=gcp('nocreate'); [~,numproc]=system('nproc','-echo'); numproc=str2double(numproc)-1; if ~isempty(pp) delete(pp); end N=2000; N=numproc*ceil(N/numproc); A=randn(N); B=randn(N); pause(1) tic C1=zeros(N,N); for n1=1:N for n2=1:N C1(n1,n2)=sum(A(n1,:).*B(:,n2)'); end end t1=toc; fprintf('\nsimple loop took %.2f Seconds\n',t1); pause(1) pp=parpool(numproc); A=randn(N); B=randn(N); pause(1) tic CC2=cell(1,numproc); Np=round(size(B,2)/numproc); parfor np=[1:numproc] Btmp=B(:,[1:Np]+(np-1)*Np); CC2{np}=zeros(N,Np); for n1=1:N for n2=1:Np CC2{np}(n1,n2)=sum(A(n1,:).*Btmp(:,n2)'); end end end C2=cat(2,CC2{:}); t2=toc; fprintf('\nparallel loop (1/2) took %.2f Seconds\n',t2); pause(1) A=randn(N); B=randn(N); pause(1) tic C2a=zeros(N,N); parfor n1=1:N for n2=1:N C2a(n1,n2)=sum(A(n1,:).*B(:,n2)'); end end t2a=toc; fprintf('\nparallel loop (2/2) took %.2f Seconds\n',t2a); pause(1) delete(pp); A=randn(N); B=randn(N); pause(1) tic C3=A*B; t3=toc; fprintf('\nmatrix multiplication took %.4f Seconds\n',t3); On my machine, this gives simple loop took 25.30 Seconds parallel loop (1/2) took 59.28 Seconds parallel loop (2/2) took 27.46 Seconds matrix multiplication took 0.0423 Seconds As i said my parallel code could probably be improved, so you might be able to get it down to 3-4 seconds...which is still 100x slower than matrix multiplication. 
BTW I realized i screwed up my previous recorded test - Im actually recording just over 1.2 TFLOPS for double precision compute. Which is more like what id expect, since theoretical max is 1.6-1.7 and im thermal throttling a litle bit on the workload (plus matlab adds a bit of overhead, though not much. 70-75% of theoretical maximum isnt bad, considering its MATLAB and all)
Many who work with large data sets have run into this. Usually the solution was batch processing chunks of the data and concatenating at the end.
Not sure if this applies but it might be worth checking your data import and make sure Matlab does not leave any of the files open from the import. I once accidentally commented out fclose and ended up with memory issues. You may want to add fclose('all') after the data has been loaded into Matlab.
What do you have so far?
Try using Matlab's built-in profiler to see where it's chewing up memory. To turn it on, use: profile -memory on Run your code, then run: profile report Remember to clear your profiler between each run profile clear There's some more information on stack overflow [here] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21997579/memory-profiling-of-matlab-columns-meaning/22585099#22585099)
Hmm, well all I know is that the same algorithm he would write in Matlab would run much faster in Python. Even a lot of brute force methods seem to run faster. 
I'll probably end up splitting it in to chunks, or I'll just get the exported file of results from my partner. I'm not sure how the concatenation will work out when combining two 300,000*3 double arrays, but hey I'll give it a go later!
You might be looking for cumsum(V) function.
I have not defined conditions already. Could you give an example of how to define the conditions?
haha yes I am
Yes, that was indeed one of my problems
I mentioned pagefile in my post and am sitting at -1, you've got it and you're sitting at 3 SMH. It's almost certainly something to consider, given the other details OP mentioned, i.e. their colleague with inferior memory runs fine.
So after I ask the user to input the number of trials (that should be even): N = input ('Input the number of trials for this discrimination task:'); N=2N; Matlab says there's a parse error at N: usage might be invalid matlab syntax. When I put N=2(N) matlab says there's is a parse error at '(': usage might be invalid matlab syntax. And yes, I would need an equal amount of 1s and 0s, my professor told me to use the randperm function for this but did not explain how
So it means that one should use natively parallelized functions as much as one can. So is it that these functions automatically detect multi-cores and run parallel in the above example? Where can I find the list of such natively parallelized functions?

Change the “Unit” field to “pixels”
Yes, they will inherently use multiple cpu cores. And are able to utalize the cpu much better (some can utalize avx, some are optimized to reduce caxhe misses, etc). Idk of a list oc wgst is/isnt parallelizes, but if your not sure check cpu utalization while it runs. It should be obvious uf its singlet threaded or not. Matrix ops, ffts, convolution, bitwise operations are a few examples off the top of my head
You need some kind of distance metric. A simple one could be the sum of all distances between different curves at all time points. Another one could be to find the highest-energy frequency and use that value to represent each curve. Exactly what metric to use depends on what your data looks like. 
[I'm sorry, but I had to](https://i.imgur.com/01wtqyw.gif)
I was looking at something like this. The problem I'm trying to figure out right now is that, to compare any two conditions, requires me to make an average of the curves in said conditions. I know there's a substantial amount of variance in my data that I've yet to figure out a way to discard other than curve fitting... If that makes sense/ sound scorrect? 
If for some reason you want a more “mathy” way of doing this, what came to mind not knowing about the cumsum() function was to multiply your vector by a lower triangular matrix of ones. `J = tril(ones(60))*V`
Thank you! This is a great starting point and works. [https://imgur.com/UrejeHm](https://imgur.com/UrejeHm) \------ How do I go about coloring the line based on the velocity components in Row:5 ad Row:6? Do I combine velocity components (u,v) into a new velocity in Row:9 and then normalize this value by dividing it by the largest velocity? &amp;#x200B; Then have the Coloring inserted into plot() where color = array(9, j)\*RGB from Blue to Red? (blue slow, red fast)
&gt; The problem I'm trying to figure out right now is that, to compare any two conditions, requires me to make an average of the curves in said conditions. No. Imagine that the first curve is a1=[1 2 3] and the second is a2=[1.5 2 1.5]. Then the distance between them can be norm(a1-a2). 
?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? Just started coding, theirs things other than a for or while loop ?!?!?!?!?
`parfor` = parallel for Works great when you have an SSD or pci drive for writing data. ...or really anything that can be ran in parallel (need to check how things are indexed to prevent collisions...it'll yell at you). Also has issues if you try to stack it...check the man.
Have you tried the nprtool in Matlab for time series classification??
I'll give that a go in the morning. Not sure I really have any priors about what should be coming out the other side as a target but can't hurt to fiddle about! Thank you.
Have you looked at Mathwork's guide on this? https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/resolving-out-of-memory-errors.html They also have a guide on how Matlab allocates memory that is worth reading: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/memory-allocation.html Sorry I've got no specific tips, but hopefully there is something useful in those links.
Probably one should ask the Matlab support for the list since it would be a useful information. &amp;#x200B;
Are the places where files are opening and not being closed? Often when my code does this I put a "fclose('all')" at the end of a loop or something to clear up some room
Similarly make sure there arent any large arrays being unecessarily copied or stored. And you should reallocate array space if you haven't already particularly if an array is being updated lots of times (e.g. appending a new row to an array is very memory expensive as it copies the whole array to add on)
I assume you'd need to modify the original .m file on which the p-file function is based, but I don't have any first-hand experience in this area.
If your function accepts and returns vectors, you can do something like: y = myFunction(x); myVal = trapz(x, y); Where `myFunction` is the name of your mystery function. This will evaluate the function at the values in `x` and return the vector of values corresponding to those inputs as `y`. If it's not a vector-capable function: y = arrayfun(@(p) myFunction(p), x); myVal = trazp(x, y); This uses an [anonymous function](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/anonymous-functions.html) (aka "[lambda expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function)") to evaluate your mystery function at each value in `x` one-by-one (where each is temporarily assigned to `p`, the "predicate"), assigning each result to the corresponding position in vector `y`. If the function does everything behind the scenes and just returns that plot window after acting on your input, you may be out of luck. In this case, try checking the documentation to see if it gives you access to the data after running the command. Hope that helps! --- [`arrayfun` Documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/arrayfun.html)
Ooo this seems like that I want! My dumb question is how do I find the name of the function? Is it possible in code running from a p-file?
I assumed the p-file was the function, and the name would simply be the same. If the p-file is a whole script, with many functions, then you're in the third category (out of luck). Double-check the documentation for that tool to make sure, though.
I got upto setting the vector (n=15000:20000) and setting up v=length(collatz(i))
gotcha, might be out of luck. Thanks for the help!
All the best!
Use for spaces to format your code as code. This is unreadable. To repeat something multiple times, you typically use a for loop. for myIteration = 1:4 % Code to be repeated end
Oo actually, giving up on a direct access to the function led me to a partial version of your second approach. Excuse my inability to say this clearly, using the Basic Fitting functionality in Tools on the GUI, fitting a spline to my inaccessible function, then I can save the f(x)s to an array. The spline seems reasonably accurate for my purposes. 
Excellent! Glad you found a workaround.

I think you can do it as you said. Just build the color directly from the normalized velocity: color = [array(9, j), 0, (maxVelocity - array(9, j))];
What are v and i?
Quick method: use guide or app designer 
meant n, my bad, and v is just the variable I assigned to keep track of number of steps it takes to run a collatz for the numbers in n
If it just needs to be an array with entries that are randomly assigned a 0 or 1, you could just use conditions=randn(N,1)&gt;0;
I’m not at my computer to check it, but I think eval() Will convert your fraction to a decimal.
Meant to clarify, sorry - I know how to convert any individual value (double() does it too), but want to change the default at a system level so I don't have to do it every time.
`vpa( ... )` is what I use to convert expressions to a decimal form. Whether or not MATLAB uses an exact form or an approximate form depends on how you arrived at that solution. You could try to use something like `var_A = 1.0` instead of `var_A = 1` earlier in the code that produced the expression. I'm not aware of a system-wide approach to implementing your preference. You could try to add `format long` to your startup.m file, not sure if it'd work though.
There are tons of ways to measure "distance" between curves. The method you use should depend on what this data is and other properties. For example, is the data noisy? Are the time points uniform between each curve? Are these curves measuring comparable things? All of this matters. As a rough first pass, what would prevent you from doing something simple such as interpolating with smooth splines and then computing the C^0 norm on the error? 
You can possibly use sequence classification workflow using the Deep Neural Networks in MATLAB as well. Obviously for this you have to pass in the labels for each signal (sequence) during the training part of the workflow.
Is this the result for symbolic computations? If so, I think that's kind of expected. You need to usually call simply() on the output of such computations. But if this is the result of numerical computation, then that's quite surprising.
Simply calling plot should work : https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/plot-dates-and-durations.html#bvgg722
Use AppDesigner. It's the recommended approach for creating GUIs now.
[https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab\_env/format-output.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/format-output.html)
So looking on the interwebs, someone else recommended using format long Let me know if that works out
This works for me (Python 2.7): runRSK = py.importlib.import_module('RSKAlgPy'); PQ = runRSK.RSK('43512') P = PQ{1} Q = PQ{2} P1 = cellfun(@(x) cell2mat(cell(x)), cell(P), 'Uniform',false) Q1 = cellfun(@(x) cell2mat(cell(x)), cell(Q), 'Uniform',false) The output I get: PQ = Python tuple with no properties. ([[1, 2], [3, 5], [4]], [[1, 3], [2, 5], [4]]) P = Python list with no properties. [[1, 2], [3, 5], [4]] Q = Python list with no properties. [[1, 3], [2, 5], [4]] P1 = 1×3 cell array {1×2 int64} {1×2 int64} {[4]} Q1 = 1×3 cell array {1×2 int64} {1×2 int64} {[4]} Obviously you can't concatenate with `vertcat` since the dimension sizes are not consistent, so you have to keep the result in a cell-array: &gt;&gt; celldisp(P1) P1{1} = 1 2 P1{2} = 3 5 P1{3} = 4 &gt;&gt; celldisp(Q1) Q1{1} = 1 3 Q1{2} = 2 5 Q1{3} = 4 
Apology accepted but that doesn't mean I'm not downvoting you
Yeah I also prefer app designer nowadays Guide has poor code readability and extra procedure 
You're on the right track, you just need to make a *for* loop that iterates over each *n*.
In the third image you have a label for every region, you can use the label corresponding to the center in the image as a new binary image and use that for circle detection
That's what I was thinking. Thanks mate!
I do have a label for every region, i want to build a new binary image based on the regions that have a boundingbox smaller then a set value... the circle will not always be in the center, it is a video of an eye moving 
The matlab help function is very helpful. Your university most likely had a free copy of matlab you can download from somewhere on their site. 
Unfortunately that's not the case, the students have to pay for it if they want to use it outside of the uni campus 
sin(4x 3 ) or sin(4x\^3 )
Hey, Idk if you already figured it out or not but you can use Octave. It is essentially an open source version of MATLAB in which you can write equivalent code and it is totally free. You can even run it in your browser! Other than that the cheapest MATLAB you can get is the student edition for like 50 bucks. 
Sorry, I didn't realise it didn't keep the formatting, the formula should be; &amp;#x200B; f(x) = 0.1e\^(-x)sin(4x\^3)
ok, cheers, I've just found the online version of Octave so I'll see if I can figure it out there.
x=\[-2:.01:3\]; %Define various x values &amp;#x200B; for i=1:length(x) %Solve for each x and store in f an g arrays f(i) = 0.1\*exp(-x(i)\*sin((4\*x(i)).\^3)); g(i) = -f(i); end &amp;#x200B; hold on%plot plot(x,f) plot(x,g) &amp;#x200B; zoom on%Zoom waitfor(gcf, 'CurrentCharacter', char(13))% click to zoom until you hit enter then script ends

At my university it seems that the science and math faculties lean towards Python and (and maybe R?), whereas the engineering faculty still goes strong with MATLAB.

This is pretty straightforward. Start by reading the documentation for the `plot` and `hold` functions. You'll probably also want to use `linspace`. The additional functions that you'll use to label axes and add titles should be easy to find while you're reading the documentation for the functions I've already mentioned.
Thanks guys! guide is confusing and my class didn’t go much into designing GUIs
Awesome, thank you so much 
No problem :) 
N=2*n. No parentheses, and use the the asterisk for multiplication. Then If you call randperm, you would have an equal amount of even and odd numbers. You could then find a way to replace those with zeros and ones using a model function. 
 `1.0` versus `1` doesn't make a difference in Matlab. It did in some languages. This is likely either a display format setting or he's using symbolic toolkit functions. 
Either you're using symbolic variables - in which case this is the expected behavior, and you probably don't want to be using symbolic variables - or somebody has set the default display format to `rat`, which displays numbers as rational values (ratios of integers). https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/format.html You can fix this by setting the format in the preferences window, or by using the `format` command in the console. 
That's a terrible way to do this, algorithmicaly. 
I suppose so, but it is the only one-line method I could think of off the top of my head 🤷‍♀️
That is very weird. What happens if you change it to a traditional `for` loop as a test? Does this only happen for 401? Or is it any number? Are you sure that your `data` variable has size 401 in that 3^rd dimension? 
Best way to learn is to pick a problem and do it. I strongly advise against reading about Matlab in a textbook. If you run into any issues while trying to solve a problem, I can almost guarantee googling the thing you're stuck on will help substantially. Once you know the basics, textbooks might be helpful for improving the efficiency of your code/how you do things, though.
Could you be more specific. It looks like you re asking a solution for a whole project. What did you try. Where are you stuck? 
Depending on your university, try to find out if you can remote in to access the Matlab resource. A lot of universities have this setup in some way, shape, or form. Notably universities with split commuter-on campus students. The others have covered the Matlab problem easy enough, so I'll defer to them.
I'd start by hiring an expert on image processing and machine learning. 
I’d suggest using the matlab academy for the basics. 
MathWorks provides an online tutorial designed for beginners. It doesn't go into great detail, but it's completely free and a great place to start.
Impossible to say without more information. Maybe optimization, and econometrics of course. Often if there's just one function you need from another toolbox you can code it yourself. 
Why go from R to Matlab? In the way of econometric type modeling (e.g., AR models at simplest), I think R has significantly more options. If it’s really necessary, I would say optimization, econometrics, signal processing, and system identification.

It works fine as a `for` loop. 401 is in the 3rd dimension. It runs perfectly fine if I copy/paste the csvwrite an extra time when the loop is done to spit out 401. Yes, it fails to give me a corresponding fprintf. It just stops at 400. 
I have done something similar in the past. Ended up selecting the region with centroid closest to last centroid
Repmat might be what you are looking for
Not sure if this will be helpful but for normal model I use linmod() it generates a state space matrix, but not equations. And I am not sure if this works with Simscape.
 &gt;&gt; syms x; &gt;&gt; int(exp(16*x)*sin(x),x) ans = -(exp(16*x)*(cos(x) - 16*sin(x)))/257
Optimization is the only real must have. Econometric’s is nice to have. The rest I have never used personally. 
Thanks for the input that's a good idea, I was hoping to have a couple independent methods and use proximity to weight the answer later.
That's super bizarre. If you remove the csvwrite so that it just does the printf, does it get to 401? Also, when you say it doesn't print the output for 401, are you sure it's not just printing it somewhere other than the last line? Parfor iterations don't necessarily happen in order. Iteration 401 could happen somewhere in the middle. 
I'm not on 2018 yet, and you didn't really describe exactly what's going wrong for you; but I've got code that was written in about 2007 that is still running unmodified today on 2017b. Your assertion that there are monthly changes to function behavior is simply untrue. Mathworks is very good at adhering to an established interface once they define it. Perhaps you're using a lot of undocumented or unintended features? 
I agree that more detail needs to be provided, perhaps a minmimum working example? I have identical code running on 2016b (Unix/HPC) and 2018a (Windows/Local) that uses load() without issue. 
I agree that project based learning is much more effective. The help from math works is acceptable. Once you get familiar with the difference between scripts and function, control structures, etc. you can get a lot done just by googling example questions and by typing doc &lt;command name&gt; in the command window. So I would just focus on the minimum you need to get started playing with it yourself. 
Thanks for the assertion. I went back and found a code related issue, that solved it. load() is okay. I think, some warning system changed in 2018b, hence confused me about the function itself. 
Thanks. Load() turns out to be good. conflict was just a warning. &amp;#x200B; Did you face any problem of 'uninitialized parameter' (paraphrased) error for custom defined functions? I was using a tool , that I did not code myself. 2018b is giving me 'uninitialized parameter' (paraphrased) error. That's what frustrated me in the first place. 
What assertion? You still haven't told us what was wrong, besides something with your code. 
My guess is your path needs to be reset. Most likely you had a custom path set when you were on 2017b, and when they reinstalled MATLAB, you reverted to the default path. 
my bad. thanks for your time.
So, do you know how to program at all and just want to learn how to use MATLAB more efficiently, or are you new to programming?
Yes. That's exactly what happened. Thanks.
Your best bet is to use [scatter](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/scatter.html) and set your velocity as the 4th input to vary the color. 
New to matlab
'Introduction to programming with Matlab' on coursera is a great course to get you started.
You're welcome. I'm happy you find your way
Yes. Just create a function: create a file called "audioProcesser.m" (or whatever you want your function to be called. Add this to the file: function audioProcesser(audioFileName) [y, Fs] = audioread(audioFileName); % do desired operations end
Thank you so much. I new it was a dumb, simple question :) Thank you however to take the time to help out.
I might be confused. Do you just want a function that you pass in a filename, and then it would a preset order of functions on that file? Something like (and I don't do DSP, so forgive me if this is a set of stupid instructions, but something like this): 1. Open the file 2. Cut out the silent parts 3. Perform a FFT on what remains 4. Extract the frequency of the first order FFT Or is it something like "based on the file name, I want to either do this set of instructions, or this other set of instructions"? Or something else entirely?
No worries, everyone starts somewhere. This link might also help: https://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/create-functions-in-files.html
Are you asking how to determine the condition for the if statement in this piece of example code? validInput = false; while validInput == false if (input is valid) validInput = true; else m = input('Invalid input! What is your move?'); end end 
Thanks for the response. The idea is to get the nxn array in ascending order by moving the numbers around. For example 3 6 5 1 2 3 1 NaN 8 ------&gt; 4 5 6 2 4 7 7 8 NaN A legal "move" would be, say, the user entering 1, 6, 8, or 4 in the above (left) example as their first move, and NaN swapping spots with that inputted value. An illegal move would be entering any non-bordering number or a number diagonal to NaN (3,5,7,2)The goal is the configuration above on the right, 1-NaN in ascending order. Sorry I didn't clarify this in post. &amp;#x200B;
Yes, 2018 did produce a warning when using load() without specifying a name for what was to be loaded. load(file_name,'s'); What I saved was a single structure, but 2018 requested I specify the name of the variable.
Okay, so you're basically just asking how to determine if the move is illegal? Which is just a check to see if the number you enter is one of the 4 numbers immediately surrounding NaN.
The initial question would be how to 1. Identify the position of the inputted value and 2. Use the position to swap the value with NaN. I have looked into the find function but can't put my finger on using, say, n in the below example m=input('') n = find(puzzle==m)
&gt; Identify the position of the inputted value [ii,jj] = find(puzzle == m); &gt; Use the position to swap the value with NaN. I have looked into the find function but can't put my finger on using, say, n in the below example [m_ii m_jj] = find(puzzle == m); [n_ii n_jj] = find(isnan(puzzle)); puzzleTemp = puzzle; puzzleTemp(m_ii,m_jj) = puzzle(n_ii,n_jj); puzzleTemp(n_ii,n_jj) = puzzle(m_ii,m_jj);
Appreciate it very much!

Nonlinear functions? Polynomials? Do you have symbolic toolbox?
https://se.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/solve.html 
I got help in the discord and have it working with Sufrace() I didnt want to use Scatter because I wanted the lines to be connected. &amp;#x200B; All thats left is to get the scaling of the velocity just right so that I dont suppress all the movement. 
Yes, it is exactly that. This is an introductory class to DSP, so we have barely scratched the surface, but i just wanted to try to make as many functions in matlab to just practice my coding skills.
What exactly is your question? Are you unsure about how "randn()" works? Play with it! Try: randn randn() randn(5) randn(5,1)
&gt;Generate a set of N (\~10,000) samples from a Normal (0, 1) distribution using the function randn Thanks for the feedback. ..So how would I "Generate a set of N (\~10,000) samples from a Normal (0, 1) distribution using the function randn". I see that the commands you mentioned are generating a matrix of sorts?
No problem...looks like one of your classmates [might be on reddit too](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/b14pc6/15_piece_puzzle/).
Sounds like a fun project. I would start with a "puzzle" class. It would hold a matrix that represents the puzzle board. It should have methods like: * display() % prints the board * move(x, dir) % move number x in direction dir * resize(n) % resize the puzzle to size n * scramble() % scrambles the puzzle
Hint: randn generates numbers from the standard normal distribution (i.e. "Normal(0,1)"). 
Got it... I think I've got it from here. I'm doing a randn(10000,1) which is giving me my 10000x1 array of samples.
Having an extremely hard time addressing invalid inputs... n = input('Please enter the number of rows/columns you would like in your puzzle\n '); puzzle = randperm(n^2,n^2); puzzle = reshape(puzzle,[n,n]); padjust = (puzzle ==n^2) ; puzzle(padjust) = NaN; solvedpuzzle = [(1:n^2)]; solvedpuzzle = reshape(solvedpuzzle.', n,n).'; spadjust = (solvedpuzzle ==n^2) ; solvedpuzzle(spadjust) = NaN; while puzzle~= solvedpuzzle display(puzzle); m = input('What is your move? '); [m_a , m_b] = find(puzzle == m); [n_a , n_b] = find(isnan(puzzle)); validinput1 = [n_a + 1 , n_b]; validinput2 = [n_a - 1 , n_b]; validinput3 = [n_a , n_b + 1]; validinput4 = [n_a , n_b - 1]; if [m_a , m_b] ~= validinput1 fprintf('Invalid input, try again'); end if [m_a , m_b] ~= validinput2 fprintf('Invalid input, try again'); end if [m_a , m_b] ~= validinput3 fprintf('Invalid input, try again'); end if [m_a , m_b] ~= validinput4 fprintf('Invalid input, try again'); end newpuzzle = puzzle; newpuzzle(m_a,m_b) = puzzle(n_a,n_b); newpuzzle(n_a,n_b) = puzzle(m_a,m_b); puzzle = newpuzzle; display(puzzle); end Is it possible to use logical '|' in an if statement? I tried but it wasn't working for me
Can you not just do if/elseif?
Here's what I did: clc; clear all; validInput = false; n = input('Please enter the number of rows/columns you would like in your puzzle\n '); puzzle = randperm(n^2,n^2); puzzle = reshape(puzzle,[n,n]); padjust = (puzzle ==n^2) ; puzzle(padjust) = NaN; solvedpuzzle = [(1:n^2)]; solvedpuzzle = reshape(solvedpuzzle.', n,n).'; spadjust = (solvedpuzzle ==n^2) ; solvedpuzzle(spadjust) = NaN; while ~isequal(puzzle,solvedpuzzle) while validInput == false display(puzzle); m = input('What is your move? '); [m_a , m_b] = find(puzzle == m); [n_a , n_b] = find(isnan(puzzle)); validinput1 = [n_a + 1 , n_b]; validinput2 = [n_a - 1 , n_b]; validinput3 = [n_a , n_b + 1]; validinput4 = [n_a , n_b - 1]; if [m_a , m_b] == validinput1 | [m_a, m_b] == validinput2 | [m_a, m_b] == validinput3 &amp; [m_a, m_b] == validinput4 validInput = true; else fprintf('Invalid input. Try again.'); end end [m_a , m_b] = find(puzzle == m); [n_a , n_b] = find(isnan(puzzle)); newpuzzle = puzzle; newpuzzle(m_a,m_b) = puzzle(n_a,n_b); newpuzzle(n_a,n_b) = puzzle(m_a,m_b); puzzle = newpuzzle; display(puzzle); validInput = false; end
You can also use fzero().
You're on your way! Keep asking questions.
It's worth noting there are some differences in how a few things are done, so if you're submitting homework, double check that oot works on the school computers. 
Given the latency and overhead of transferring from RAM to VRAM, a GPU in a laptop is probably best suited for development work, not actual calculation. Furthermore, if you can run your matlab scripts on a cluster, I would spec a laptop for portability over performance.
Seem to make sense. 
The [robot_localization](http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/robot_localization/html/index.html) ROS package would be a good start on the ROS side.
For work: Surface Pro I5. Not very fast but it's okay for coding. Also for work when I bring it in: MSI GE63VR 7RE Raider. It's mostly about the processing power you have than the GPU, but the GPU helps with graphics intensive problems. I bought the surface pro for note taking and the MSI for gaming. They seem to work for me.
That's *extremely* application specific. Do whatever works for your situation. 
Yeah, I've used TeamViewer and there is also a Chrome Remote Desktop. Just leave the tower and remote into it. You can sync output folders to dropbox or google drive to make it even easier. The output will auto download to your laptop.
Thank you. Do you use a remote access card? 
Thank you. Does it mean that you run matlab on Surface Pro? 
Directly, yes. Its inadequate for anything other than coding and basic troubleshooting but anything that has a decent size doesn’t work well at all.
If you have jobs you need to run, I had mine set up so that as soon as I pushed my code to the Visual Studio Team Services online repository, it would take that code, and then use my computer at home to run the code and compile. All automated. Are you trying to do run stuff on matlab? Or just use it as a predetermined processor?
What do you mean?

That would be cool... I try to run on matlab. But a laptop can have a limited number of cores for example. Thus one needs to connect a laptop to the workstation to run matlab at the workstation. 
I haven't. I would try the web based first see if it works personally. If you are using TeamViewer for work you should get a license. I think Chrome remote doesn't stipulate that though. 
Nothing beats a smart code. But still one wants to have a good hardware. 
I use git to commit and push matlab codes onto my cloud repository(VSTS, from wherever I want. My team even collaborated) and then use their 'build' features to push that code to my high-powered computer, which was connected to VSTS though the internet. Once my high powered computer was done with the simulations, I would have it make a report(Also though scripting) and then email it out to me. It worked great, and didn't require a ton of programming either. 
I’m assuming you are using a Step source block and a Transport Delay block, right?
If your workstation is or can be switched to running linux, this can be easily and conveniently achieved for MATLAB and any other program through `ssh`.
I have a laptop &amp; remote work station. I remote into it using Microsoft *Remote Desktop.* Works well enough when network isn't saturated.
I second TeamViewer. I’ve used TV to remote into my work PC and run code, and to support others across the globe. It is an impressive cross-platform utility.
It is pretty solid. I've run remote machines from an airplane lol. 
Nice. My most extreme were: - configuring TCP/IP settings in a Win8 (ugh) machine in Mandarin from my MacBook. - giving a software demonstration of live data collection to multiple clients via GoToMeeting on my work Win7 desktop, using TV on my MacBook from home. 
Hmm. i guess the parallel computing toolbox isnt quite working right on my machine. It is, however, nice to see that my parallel code isnt nearly as bad as I thought lol. Im going to make an educated guess that this is a 16-core sandy-bridge xeon, since a whole bunch of those exit out in the wild and the results make sense (relative to mine). Single threaded is mostly dominated by rawclock speed, and my machine has a fairly decent 4.2 GHz clock for non-avx workloads. Id guess this is nearly double the clock of your server (cpu architecture + memory improvements also help a bit) Those parallel times are about what id expect. As I mentioned before due to parpool overhead going from single threaded to N threaded only tends to give at most a factor of 0.5-0.7 N speedup, so 8-10x speedup of 16 cores is about right most of the difference on the matrix multiply is AVX. sandy/ivy bridge avx is, clock-for-clock, 4x less capable than skylake-x (you get 2x from adding AVX2/FMA3, allowing simultaneous add+multiply , and 2x from the jump to avx512, which doubles the simd pipeline width).The rest of the difference is the clockspeed and the memory speed (matrix operations are optimized enough that memory throughput and latency actually matter, so going from ddr3 to ddr4 helps a good bit, and my system has rather good ddr4 too)
Roots, fsolve, fzero depending on the type of equation and what toolboxes you have. 
 fplot(@(x) log*abs(cos*x), [-2*pi, 2*pi, 100])
Not sure if that's the code you've tried, but you've used improper syntax fplot(@(x) log(abs(cos(x))), [-2*pi, 2*pi])
Thankyou I’m just starting so I’m not to familiar with it yet 
Something that would work is simply adding an i=i-1 within your if statement. That would revert i to the previous iteration, then upon recycling it will be the next iteration which was wrong. side note: I recommend the "warning" command as it uses the orange text you see when you do something wrong but it's not an error
You can use nargin to set default values. If you want to add a structure in your input you can code it like that but using nargin you can provide default values if no graphics structure is provided function(input1,input2,..., graphics_input) if nargin &lt; (n inputs - 1) graphics_input = [set some defaults or use a blank vector since plot functions usually recognize [] as an empty input for defaults but I could be wrong]
I don't know if this will work for sure but you could try reassigning i. Try setting it back to 1 if you want to start again or if you just want that particular input to be acquired again then try doing i=i-1. You can put this in your if condition. Then make an else statement where you can say i=i+1 in it.
You now have an if statement that checks if the value is negative. Maybe make this into a while loop that keeps prompting the user to put in a number? Or alternatively, take the absolute value of the negative number! 
Why do you have that `looper` variable? It looks like it's exactly equal to `i`. Although, it's a really bad habit to use i as a loop index, because in Matlab `i == j == sqrt(-1)`. The typical way I've seen people do this is to put their question/response code inside a while loop that will end if the user provides correct input. You can have a while loop *inside* a for loop, if that helps. Also, Matlab is underlining that variable with a squiggly yellow line for a reason. You should take its advice and correct the problem. If you don't know what it's trying to tell you, read the documentation on the issue it's pointing out. It won't matter much for code this simple, but it's good to start following good habits early so they're second nature when it matters. 
+
Put 4 spaces before your code on its own line, or surround it in backticks (\`) to format it properly, like this: fplot(@(x) log*abs(cos*x), [-2*pi, 2*pi, 100]. (k, :)) It looks like you're trying to multiply `log` with the absolute value of cosine times x. Multiplying a function and a number doesn't really make sense, but that's more of a mathematical misunderstanding than a Matlab problem. I think you should work on learning the math required for this class before you tackle programming problems. 
Thank you for info. I will work on it. &amp;#x200B;
How long? 
Reach out to mathworks support, they'll give you some tips.
I'll check. It mostly hangs on the splash screen, but everything else also takes a long time.
 It is Intel Xeon E5-2660. Thank you for your comments. 
Try to figure out where it is coming from: [https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/92566-why-does-matlab-get-stuck-in-the-initializing-or-busy-state-or-take-a-long-time-to-start](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/92566-why-does-matlab-get-stuck-in-the-initializing-or-busy-state-or-take-a-long-time-to-start)
I don't see how it's a very specific problem, I'm just wondering if that type of solution is sloppy coding or not. 
Cool, thank you - that's a good idea, I'll add a default case to fall back on. 
What kind of license are you using? Network or local? I've seen this issue when using a network license. Even after you get past the splash screen, it would report as Busy for ~5 minutes even on a simple command. After that, it would work as normal.
No I have a local license.
Both are fine, although a script would be a bit odd. You could just manipulate the plot in your regular code, or in whatever plotting function you've created already. This is entirely dependent on what you're working on and what you need in that situation. What's reasonable in a polished gui application may be different from what's reasonable in a polished gui with a different code structure, different from what is reasonable in a single-use script to generate a single plot once, different than what's reasonable when experimenting in the console, different from what is reasonable in an analysis script that is used often but never published or shared, etc. 
Assuming you are using Step and Transport Delay: there is fundamentally no difference in behavior between changing the Time delay parameter in a Transport Delay block and adding a longer Step time to a Step block. &amp;#x200B; For example, let's say you have two Step blocks (Step 1 and Step 2) hooked up to a scope. Both have a Step time of 1. Let's add a Transport Delay between Step 2 and the scope, and set the Time delay to 1. Let's change Step time for the "Step 1" block to 2. &amp;#x200B; Run simulation. Look at the scope plots. No difference in behavior.
I've had that where Matlab is trying to do things our IT won't allow so it sits and spins for a while 
Try resetting your path to default. It worked for me.
No idea except that I would get as much as RAM as you can. IIRC Matlab can hog quite a bit when working on large image data sets.
Thank you so much! This is exactly what I'm looking for! 
Good point — I didn’t think about that. Thanks 
lot's of fast ram, fast processor. I have an acer swift 3 during a sale. I've been extremely happy with it so far.

MacBook Pro User here. The RAM of my laptop is 16GB and I'm happy with it so far. A friend of mine use MacBook air but her laptop freezes when running Matlab now and then. I am not sure if it is the problem of RAM or the laptop is just too old (bought before 2011, I recall)
Can you remote over internet?
Yes but it is through a VPN. The setup works great inside a trusted network.
Sorry that I took ages to respond to your fast reply ! So I changed everything to pixels, but it kept not letting me increase the height of the window. So I changed my layout a bit and selected "characters" and now everything even scales properly !
/r/SuggestALaptop 
https://youtu.be/spUNpyF58BY Check out Fourier transform by 3brown1blue or whatever his name is. That’s all you will need to know about transforms for something like this. You would have to have function data to do it without a computer, and then still would want a computer. Basically, it doesn’t matter if you know the math or not. Essentially, a F.T. uses a complex exponential to generate a new function where all time components are turned into frequency components. This new function, when plotted using the stem() plot in matlab will generate a bunch of discrete points and visually display signal make up. The magnitudes of frequency is what your looking for/at. The big frequency spikes will be the main compositions of the signal data, and you can then put a low pass, high pass, or bandpass filter on the signal. Sorry, I’ve only used FFT once so I can’t debug your code, but it’s probably what I would use for this. I would definitely generate stem plots to verify my work visually (if possible). 
Disable all the packages you don't use often and see if that helps.
I haven’t looked at the sidebar, but I would hope it outlines the following guidelines for posting: - Be clear in your question and provide context and relevant code, data, etc. - Ask for help with something specific and don’t expect others to do your work for you. As far as I can tell, you have a plot of frequency-vs-amplitude and are trying to determine the frequency that corresponds to a peak in amplitude. This can be done by clicking on data in the figure, or procedurally with functions such as *max()*.
Do you have a “startup.m” file? Do you have folders on your MATLAB path that are on a network or in the cloud? 
I know (generally) what FFT does, and I made other tools to make power spectrum plots and such. Butter and Filter are the only functions I know of for bandpass filtering and they're explicitly not permitted for the assignment. I tried using them and could only get the tone isolated, and the sounds underneath were basically gone. Usually I see this problem stated as finding the tone and removing everything else. This is the opposite. I am trying to do a manual sort of band stop I guess. I've found the signal/tone to remove, but when it try to delete it, I always get some kind of popping sound. I guess I'm looking for techniques to reduce that popping sound. Otherwise, I'm experimenting with how many and by how much I should reduce the FFT terms corresponding to the unwanted tone.
That is right sorry I was not clear. As soon as I try something I will post it for checking
Not sure is there a squeeze equilvalent for cell arrays 
Use higher ram and faster processors Been comparing mine to my friend's crappy laptop The running speed is different 
I think you can feed square brackets to *reshape()* to let it determine the output size in a given dimension. Supposing matrix M: M2 = reshape( M, size( M, 1), [] ) 
My university had a license where we could install in our laptops. Not sure why would you use illegal copy when you get it for free. ;)
for x = size(coms,1):-1:1 if ~any(cellfun('isempty', coms(x,:))) coms(x,:) = []; end end for y = size(coms,2):-1:1 if ~any(cellfun('isempty', coms(:,y))) coms(:,y) = []; end end
I do have a startup.m file. All path folders are local.
Thank u 
You must have a feedback from position. Usually in literature the output is given as rotational velocity. If your model has the output as velocity you must integrate it and then feedback to controller. If you already have a position output you just make a feedback. When motor reaches position the output signal output is equally to the input desired position hence the error is 0 and motor turns off.
You cannot control the position if your measurement is speed. Just because that would imply that you have a perfect knowledge of the initial position and perfect measurement. Any bias in the speed measurement would lead to an increasing error in the position. Formally, using the speed to control the position will lead to a non contrôlable system. Moreover, most of the sensors are position sensors: incremental encoders, hall effects.. So basically you need a pi control loop plus some switching logic (state flow for instance) 
What are you trying to do in the startup file?
If I remember well `ratings(:,1) == FSPlace(1,1)` should return a column vector with 1 in the positions of the column ratings(:,1) which have the desired value.
Yaa it helped quite a bit! thanks! is there a way I can limit it to finding just one? like find(k,n,1) or find(k,n,first)?
Can one choose which of Windows/Linux to be booted remotely? 
Can one work over the internet, without VPN?
Wow! Sounds like you're trying to solve a black box problem. For simple regressions, I like to use fminsearch to minimize residual. If you really have no idea what the function is, this sounds like it could be an opportunity for a machine learning algorithm.
Thank you for the info. &amp;#x200B;
I'm not sure what you mean
With Matlab, you can do automatically a multivariable linear regression with unknown coefficients... Matlab figure out the coefficients. But you have to plot your variables
Firstly, you really want to do so inme kind of dimensionality reduction (PCA is a decent first choice) to see if you can project down to a linear space that is smaller than 40 variables. Secondly, polynomials are a fine basis function, but based on your data sin waves or wavelets or something might be better
I suppose so however it is not a good idea. You would be allowing pretty much anyone access to that computer.
Find should work pretty much exactly like this. Read the documentation to make sure you get the syntax correct. 
Sorry, was away for a day. I ran the code again just now on a new data set, which had tsteps=501. It also stopped at file 500. I copied the contents of the command window to excel, checked it, and it never had an fprintf for. Next, I commented out the csv write, leaving only the fprintf statement, it blasted through that instantly, and again, when the contents of the cmd window was copied to excel and sorted, it ended at file 500. Confirmed in both instances at the end that tsteps=501 and my counter z=501. ...wtf?!
First of all, you can use find with two indices like: [row,col] = find() But still I think its better if you use the function ismember(). Check it out, its pretty simple and should work for your case
Woah dude, that's really weird. It sounds to me like you've found a legitimate bug. I'd get in touch with Mathworks tech support. You've done a great job isolating and testing the problem and this is definitely not intended behavior for `parfor`. If you're not personally the license holder, your university or employer (whoever owns the license) should have account information you can use to get support from Mathworks. They're very helpful. 
I'll reach out! It seems like a basic implementation of a variable. 
Yeah definitely. As far as I can see, that is an entirely appropriate method of invoking a parfor loop. There shouldn't be any prohibition on using a variable for the loop endpoint, and if there is there ought to also be a warning displayed about it at runtime. 
Then what will be a good alternative that one has to go through the Internet? Or do you set up VPN for remote connection? 
Thanks for the response. coms( all(cellfun(@isempty,coms),2),:) = []; This is working without the loop, but it only removes rows that are entirely blank across all columns, not all blank rows for a particular column. I'll keep trying with this. 
Thanks for the response. For some reason this isn't doing anything.

Sorry, I missed the cell array part.
Nothing just checked my path destinations.
Can you explain what you're doing with `t`, `t1`, and `t2`? I'm having a hard time understanding that part. 
What the other guy said. Also, your t2 definition in the loop seems to index the 2(i+2)^th element of t, which *eventually* has fewer than 2(i+2) elements. Did you mean `2*t(i+2)` instead of `t(2*(i+2))`?
I'm trying to separate the Sinx chart at intervals. For example, from 0 to 4pi to sinx chart t1 (0 to pi) and t2 (pi to 2pi) after t1 (0 to 2pi) and t2 (2pi to 4pi) if the average is equal. we have found period
You could simulate fuel consumption, stages, pressure reading, any kind of reading tbh!! 
recently did this for a homework, Do some orbital mechanics to find the orbital speed you want to avhieve, look up equations of motion for a rocket. Code them into Matlab, use ode45, plot downrange vs altitude in a loop to get an interesting animation.
Do you think solving altitude as a function of time by solving some differential equations using euler's method would be silly/ good enough?
Well, I would suggest a couple of places to start: * Identify a vehicle whose stats are known. I'd say look at a redstone rocket. It was a simple beastie and i believe all of it's flight characteristics are easily found. You are looking for mass, engine performance, fuel load, fuel flow rate (which gives you your mass time derivative). You might also be able to find a listing for it's max dynamic pressure. * atmospheric drag ( coefficient -0.02v^2 is the accepted value for approximations, i think (then multiply by cross-sectional area, if i remember correctly, and it changes with altitude) * Depending on what exactly you decided to model, the [rocket equation] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation) might be helpful (exhaust gas velocity * ln(wet mass/dry mass) With these bits of information, you can proximate velocity at any time in a vertical flight. Sadly, rockets don't do purely vertical flight for very long Why? they need to build up speed (angular velocity might be worth looking into), so you could then look into launch shape - add theta to your model. In fact, you could use numeric approximation with the fest set of properties to show approximate speed at a specific altitude for different launch shapes, ship mass vs velocity in atmosphere, etc. It'll be complex either way, but it'll be really damned !FUN! And then go play kerbal space program and feel like a boss. 
Im not a big matlab programmer !! Just picked it up at school this semester but i started enjoying programming. So im no genius in matlab:( However, as a mechanical engineer i think that using a simulation of a rocket sounds really nice!! You could even use your altitude formula/script to affect the gravity inside the shuttle!
I own a MacBook Pro and I would not recommend the current generation due to issues with the keyboard and with the display cable. The most recent model of the previous design is 2015, but they can be hard to find.
You have quite a few options, all depending on how deep down the rabbit hole you want to go: &amp;#x200B; 1) A very basic, single stage vehicle with predefined burn rate and fuel mass, ignoring aerodynamics or maneuvering. While this is basic, you will still need to simulate the thrust and decreasing mass of the vehicle to get accelerations right. Then, you simply integrate the accelerations twice to get position. A \*very\* simple simulation would lock the rocket to one orientation, say straight up from the surface, and ignore rotating motion. This would probably be a good venue for you to compare different integration schemes, something that will probably apply very well to a numerical methods class. 2) Stepping it up a bit, and moving into multiple stage vehicles. Once you've done a single stage, this should require no more than a bit of refactoring of your code to allow for repeating the process once staging occurs. &amp;#x200B; 3) Stepping up further, adding aerodynamics. You'll need some data on the cross sectional area of the vehicle, it's drag coefficient at various conditions, and an atmospheric model. Matlab has the US76 atmosphere model built into the aerospace toolbox to make this a bit easier. &amp;#x200B; 4) Finally, you could really let loose and let the rocket maneuver. You could even put in TVC (thrust vector control) and try to close the loop with an autopilot to get the rocket to follow a certain trajectory, despite disturbances from small misalignments in thrust, aero forces, etc. Reader beware, this particular topic (control and guidance of an ascent vehicle) gets really deep and really complicated, really fast.

You can definitely use Euler's method to solve your ode, just make sure your time step is small enough to get an accurate solution (but not so small that it takes hours to calculate).
Thank you very much. yeah I don't want to develop any bad habits and I guess my code will be ugly for a bit. "You can have a while loop inside a for loop, if that helps." This does help, thank you a lot, I really appreciate it.
Thanks heaps. I'll look into it and see what I can do, I'll update you guys by tomorrow seeing how it went. Ended up getting pretty caught up with some other work/family stuff.
Thank you so much for the lengthy reply. I'll look into this and see what I can do. I'll give you an update by tomorrow night and see how it goes. Sorry for not replying earlier, I really appreciate it though.
Oh, I think I misunderstood what you meant originally, you dont care about preserving rows, you just want all empty cells in a particular column erased?
Depends which part you want to simulate. We do trajectory analaysis by co-simulating with MSC Adams and simulink compiled DLLs. I wouldnt have said creating this is something to take on lightly though.
 N = input('please enter a whole number bigger than 1: '); k=[1:N]'; R = ((N+10*k)/(N^2)); C= (((4*N^2)-(4*k.^2))/(N^2)); nR=1.0-R; nC=1.0-C; out=R*nC'-C*nR'; That's my attempt based on my understanding of what you wrote. The last line might actually be `R*nC'-nR*C` though. I can't tell from what you've written 
Use hold on. SubplotPlot(...) Hold on Plot(X) Plot(Y)
You could create two figures with handles and then assign plots to specified figure through its handle.
Hi, thank you for your help Do you know how it would look like in term of code?
Try something like f1 = figure; f2 = figure; for i =1:n figure(f1) subplot() plot(x) figure(f2) subplot() plot(y) end 
You don't want nor need a symbolic variable for this. You can make a matrix where you have an expression for each element as a function of its subscripts by using meshgrid. 
Worked like a charm, thank you so much !
This I been using subplots in for loops to plot array of signals 
&gt;I also would like to obtain a visual effect similar Mathematica where the math symbols like an integral or differentiation appear. I tried prettify but it's not the desired effect. You could use LaTeX for that. 
Don’t forget to assign your axis labels in the loop. Usually you are working with very similar data when doing this and can save some lines by doing this. 
The trick is that equation (5b) is still only dependent on t, and t0 is one of your initial conditions. You would have to give the ODE solver t0 as a variable, and then it would be easy to solve. 
That's correct. The columns pertain to fixed categories. The rows are just instances of entering comments on a form. I want to delete the blank comments per column.
I think you may be better served by having rand produce a matrix of random values which you use for each component. This will remove the need for a for loop and allow you to see which combinations produce the largest deviations. variants = rand(15,1)-1; This gives 15 normally distributed random values centered around 0 allowing you to have +/- 0.5 percent as the range. However, it will occasional exceed 0.5 as one standard deviation is only 66% of the area.
Wait a sec, rand is uniformly distributed. You want randn for normally distributed. But since op only has a range, I think rand is the right tool for the job.
It probably is a USB serial device. [See here for using serial devices with Matlab.](https://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/serial-port-devices.html)
Try going through an iteration or two by hand to see what each of your variables evaluates to. Also, how will you ensure you've actually found one period? For example, two periods will have the same average as one period. 
you rock! 
i'm not going to dig through all of that for you, but you need to find that actual processing function that gets called when you hit the button. this function may live within a callback function for the button. if there is a .fig file included in the repo, you can open it up in GUIDE, find the button, right click and select "go to call back function". if it doesn't have a .fig and everything is generated programmatically, i don't think there's an easy way to do it except to go through the .m file. &amp;#x200B;
There is a callback funtion. How can I call it programmatically?
On my machine if I run the following syms t int(35*t,0,128) It returns a number When I try your humongous expression I get nothing. I'm thinking you either have a typo in your function or MATLAB can't solve it. Have you tried Wolfram Alpha? 
 height = max(sum(~cellfun('isempty', coms))); newComs = cell(height, size(coms,2)); for x = 1:size(coms,2) col = coms(~cellfun('isempty', coms(:,x)),x); newComs(1:length(col),x) = col; end coms = newComs; Something like that may do what you want.
two different cases: &amp;#x200B; 1) if that callback function is calling another function to do the actual processing, that's the .m file you'd be able to call programmatically. &amp;#x200B; 2) the actual processing occurs natively within the callback function. copy that section into your own .m file and call it programmatically. &amp;#x200B; either way the big hurdle you're going to face is making sure your inputs match the inputs of the code that's already written. sometimes people will use "handles" as a catch-all for all the data, so you'll need to figure out how your desired inputs would match up to the inputs of the code already written. if you put in some break points and step through line by line, it should be relatively straightforward to see what's going on.
+ Thanks for the assistance!
After reviewing your code and trying to rap my head around what you're saying, I still can't figure it out honestly. I do appreciate the help and I'd understand if it's pretty frustrating when you're trying to help someone and they just don't get it.
From the doc page for int(): &gt; When int cannot compute a definite integral, numerically approximate the integral by using vpa. &gt; To approximate integrals directly, use vpaintegral instead of vpa. The vpaintegral function is faster and provides control over integration tolerances. So just do vpa(A), or use the alternate way they suggest. I'm not sure why int() can't compute the integral, the integrand looks pretty well behaved. For almost all definite integrals I don't bother with symbolic math and just start with integral(), which uses adaptive quadrature.
Instead of a for loop, use a while loop. Where a for loop is defined by a vector and it sequentially moves through each iteration (ie, i=1:5), a while loop checks a variable against a boolean test, such as less than, equals, etc. In order to make a while loop work, you need a line of code to change the variable. In this case, you need an if statement to test if the value is negative. If it is, you don't change the test variable. If it's not, you add 1 to the test variable. Specifically for your code, you need to replace "for i=1:5" with "while i&lt;5". Before the loop, set i=1, and in an if statement include a line that says i=i+1 which is just to add 1 to the current check variable. When i=5 in my example, the code will exit and move on.
Use `[iscolumn()](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/iscolumn.html)` and `[transpose()](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/transpose.html?searchHighlight=transpose&amp;s_tid=doc_srchtitle)` (or the `'` operator).
You should make your for loop work for your column vector, or if a lot of code has been prewritten, temporarily transpose your current vector. 
How would I make it work for a column vector? 
I cannot use built in functions, so I'm limited to loops 
Something like this: A = [1 2 3 4] B = zeros(length(A), 1) for i =1:length(A) B(i) = A (i); end 
That would have been helpful to know in advance. Using `try` and `catch` you should be able to make your own `length()` and `size()` functions. Then just build another variable with the `(i,j)` positions transposed to `(j,i)` using a double for loop.
If you want a number, why are you using symbolic variables? 
Can you instead just do: while C ~= 0 C = Co + Av * t; t = t + 1; end 
Its running in the loop not terminating
Is t initially 0? Have you checked to see that it's actually possible for C to equal 0? What's the range of Av and Co?
I put t=0, I used the formula for random value of Co and Av and I get it at t=6.7235 seconds C is zero for the test case provided
Actually I have to find out t , such that C becomes zero at the end
Okay, and what is the domain of t? Can t be negative? Is t non-zero? The value of t which makes C = 0 totally depends on the possibilites of t, Av, and Co.
Av is negative value always and it will less than C0 always , so t is positive, max C0 is 1700 and Av around - 30
Okay, well the reason the loop isn't terminating is probably because the way that that while loop is set up, t must be an integer. To be clear, you're just trying to find the zeros of the function C? Check out some threads like [this](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/126810-how-to-find-numerical-roots-for-multivariable-functions)
I did , not of much help &amp;#x200B;
Is there any chance you can share your entire script and your data?
I’m trying to get matlab to compute the analytic solution (I’d do it myself but I need it to work for hundreds of different intervals) so that I can evaluate the error for each interval of my homemade quadrature method.
I get that too, I’ll check wolfram alpha
I absolutely would in any other situation but I’m seeking the analytic solution as I need to compare it to my quadrature method to evaluate the error. 
Just use A = A(:)'; It will leave a row vector unchanged and convert a column vector into a row vector.
You have to define a function handle for EOTH() that includes and specifies inputs. You cannot just pass "@EOTH" in directly I believe. See the documentation for ODE45.
I did define it in first line of code 1
When doing floating point arithmetic (aka- dealing with decimal numbers) never check for equality, check if you are "close enough" to your solution. Due to the way computers store information, two things which are "equal" might not show as equal. For instance, If you type `if 1 + 1/3 == 2/3 + 2/3` which is obviously equal, that will evaluate false. Instead, you should do something like: eps = !E-6 % a sufficiently small number to be "zero" if abs(C) &lt; eps % this is your "is C == 0" check 
You defined a function, not a handle to that function for use as an input to ODE45.
So can you tell me what points it is that you're looking to identify? Like x=40ish to 75ish?
Yeah that's right, essentially when they starts to be a big deviation in signal below 0 (when response starts) and when signal gets back to 0 (response ends)
Perhaps some sort of thresholds could be used? So when the signal goes below them and over them again, I can select those points, save them and plot them?
So I don't know what is noise and what isn't here. Is the data around x = 100 noise?
Main trough is my response I'm interested in, the rest is noise 
You can create a rolling average of your y values and if the value exceeds some (arbitrary) limit, you can deem that the start. Or you can do it with the slope.
Would I have to implement an if statement to do that?
 indx = 1; limitExceeded = false; while limitExceeded == false if (abs(y(indx)) &gt; limit) limitExceeded = true; end indx = indx + 1; end
Evaluate the integral by hand then just iterate over the different intervals. This is like the easiest integral possible...
I see, that makes sense thank you. Do you know how I would locate the point at which the signal then goes back to a flatline? Another threshold perhaps?
Just do the same thing in reverse. while limitExceeded = true if (abs(y(indx)) &lt;= limit) limitExceeded = false; end indx = indx + 1; end 
thanks i'll try that today &amp;#x200B;
Not sure what's going on in MATLAB, but I solved it in Mathematica for your reference: T = 128; Integrate[35 * (1 - exp(-t/(3*T) + (t/(2*T))^2 - (t/T)^3)) ,{t,0,128}] Answer: 4480+(4480 exp)/3
I see! Thank you for your help!
Change your last two lines to this: newFileName = strcat(baseFileNameYeet,'.tiff'); imwrite(img, newFileName);
No problem. Hope it works, lol. Even if it does, it's probably not the best way to do this (there's probably an existing matlab function that will do this in an error-free, more efficient manner.)
It seems MATLAB cannot evaluate integrals of the form &gt;&gt; syms t n &gt;&gt; int(exp(-t^n)) ans = int(exp(-t^n), t) In Mathematica: Integrate[Exp[-t^n],t] -((t (t^n)^(-1/n) Gamma[1/n,t^n])/n)
Integrals of that form are not straightforward. Even Mathematica doesn't give me a result when I input your entire expression. But see that: Integrate[Exp[t^n],t] answer -((t (-t^n)^(-1/n) Gamma[1/n,-t^n])/n)
Numerical C will not equal zero. You should use a stopping tolerance such as abs(C) &gt; eps
Can it compute the indefinite integral? Can't you do this by hand? It's not a complicated integral. 
for ii = 1:3 load(strcat('data_',num2str(ii))); end
I would probably built a string with the filename and then load the file for i=1:n Filename =sprintf('data_%i', i) ; load(Filename) ; end
So are array1 and array2 the same thing?
You can also use [baseFileNameYeet '.tiff'] because the file name is just a character vector/array, and this combines the two arrays.
oo, yeah. cleaner!
Adaptive quadrature comes with error estimation built-in, you can do something like: f = @(t) 35 * (1 - exp(-t/(3*T) + (t/(2*T)).^2 - (t/T).^3)); I = integral(f, 0, 128, 'RelTol', 1e-16) MATLAB will complain if it can't reach your desired tolerance. Since this function is smooth (and it's derivatives are smooth and bounded) classical quadrature methods converge very rapidly, and it has no trouble computing the integral to within machine precision. Fuctionally speaking, an answer accurate within machine precision *is* an exact answer, it isn't possible tom compute a more accurate one. 
 [x, y] = meshgrid(array1, array2); z = [ x(:) y(:) ]; z = unique(z, 'rows'); Without know what your things are (struct? string? number?), it is difficult to determine if they are the same thing. 
This is an integral of the form exp(t^n) which is not straightforward without the use of something like a gamma function. For exp(t^n) Mathematica gives -((t (-t^n)^(-1/n) Gamma[1/n,-t^n])/n) where Gamma there is the incomplete Gamma function.
MATLAB posts tutorials all the time! I subscribe to it on Facebook. If you're looking to practice something more basic, I did project Euler problems to practice processing data with MATLAB when I first started learning it and it helped a lot! 
Maybe i'm not getting your intention right, but why not (assuming 8bit grayscale): count = zeros(num_lines, 256) for a=1:num_lines count(a,:) = histcounts(gray(:,a)) end or something like this? 
Instead of using a structure, in this case it seems easier to use a cell array. In this case "count" would be a cell array (curly brackets) referring to each position of "gray", which in turn would contain your vector which is the output of histcounts. [https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/cell-arrays.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/cell-arrays.html)
Thank you!
That looks pretty easy to me. 
It's very unclear what you're asking. In the first two answers, you s the result "0", or something with length 0?
The documentation. 
Stop and think about what each line of your code does. 
read the sidebar. Provide information. We are not mind readers. Although have you tried ./ and .* and .^ instead of / * ^ ?
The whole result is: `Process[] with properties:` `Length: 0` `LongLength: 0` `Rank: 1` `SyncRoot: [1×1 System.Diagnostics.Process[]]` `IsReadOnly: 0` `IsFixedSize: 1` `IsSynchronized: 0` I just didn't want to clutter my question too much. Sorry for the confusion.
Okay that's an object with some properties, one of which happens to be called "Length". So it's length isn't going to be zero because then it wouldn't exist. I mean you could make a struct: mystruct.length = 0; length(mystruct) ans = 1
For a .NET array variable `arr`, use `arr.Length` and not `numel(arr)` to get its length. For example: arr = System.Diagnostics.Process.GetProcessesByName('notepad'); for i=0:arr.Length-1 p = arr.Get(i); disp(char(p.MainWindowTitle)) end 
In general, you can dynamically create a field name by putting it in parentheses. myFieldName = ‘test’; myStructure.(myFieldName) = ‘test2’; results in: myStructure.test = ‘test2’ Your field name will have to be a valid MATLAB variable name though, so it must start with a letter and have only letters, numbers, or underscores.
To be honest, this question appears to be more of a thermodynamics question rather than a Matlab question, since you're asking how to express the equations, not how to program this in Matlab. Maybe ask in a thermodynamics sub?
But then all I achieved is that I created a new struct...how can I use that to get information about the state of the process? My objective here is to test whether a process is running and if no, then end the loop (and then start another one). I actually tried to see whether I can get out the PID of `system('tasklist /FI "imagename eq photoshop.exe"')` and if it's null then end the loop but it doesn't seem like I can do that either.
Thank you for your answer. However, this code doesn't seem to be functioning? The `while e.MoveNext()` `p = e.Current;` `disp(char(p.MainWindowTitle))` `end` loop doesn't seem to run a single time (no char displayed). Am I the one messing up here?
It would run if you have "notepad" instances running. Obviously if no notepad processes are running, the array is empty and nothing is displayed.
I see from your comments that you're only interested in checking if a certain process is running or not. For that you can forgo the loop or iterating over the array, just check the `Length` property is not zero. arr = System.Diagnostics.Process.GetProcessesByName('notepad'); if arr.Length &gt; 0 disp('notepad is running') else disp('notepad is not running') end
&gt; gray(a,:) for "horizontal lines".
I find it helpful to use a consistent histogram bin size for all columns in the image: [~,edges] = histcounts(gray(:),256) count = zeros(num_lines, 256) for a=1:num_lines count(a,:) = histcounts(gray(:,a),edges) end
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit: - [/r/thermodynamics] [Help with PDE (Heat Storage)](https://www.reddit.com/r/thermodynamics/comments/b2p8fb/help_with_pde_heat_storage/) &amp;nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
&gt;arr = System.Diagnostics.Process.GetProcessesByName('notepad'); if arr.Length &gt; 0 disp('notepad is running') else disp('notepad is not running') end From this I can deduce 2 things: 1) you're a literal god and a life saver 2) I'm pretty dumb for not realizing I should test the length like that for 5 hours...5 hours...
&gt; 5 hours hehe happens to the best of us.. Maybe time for a short break ;)
&gt;Apologies, the 'things' are the samples of audio files. So each thing is an audioread of a .WAV. Essentially I'm comparing and processing stems of audio, however I don't want to compare the same two stems together. &amp;#x200B;
Yeah, I just assumed it would be easier to compare the data if they were in two separate arrays. I'm not opposed to having it in one array if it's possible though.
this, only I would build a set of indices instead, that way you can use the indices no matter what the "things" are.
Consider using [histcounts2](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/histcounts2.html). Set Y to be the grayscale values, and X to be the column index of each value. Then set the Xedges to “0.5:nCols+0.5”.
and then pick a problem in another engineering class and solve it using things you know and don't know in MATLAB. that's going to be one of the best ways to stretch and grow.
You haven't specified anywhere a vector corresponding to your independent variable. The vector t=1:N should do it, just declare it outside the loop (note: the loop isn't storing your indices in the variable n, you'd need to include a counter in your loop for that)
It definitely works! I haven't used matlab in a while (I made the move to R) however matlab does have some nice peak analysis utilities that I want to make use of
Why are you redefining the loop index variable inside the loop? I think you should read the documentation on for loops. 
`% Steps to take:` `% 1. Define angles` `% 2. Calculate expressions (with pi converted to degrees)` `% 3. In a loop, print the results to the console` `% 4. Do this excercise again using the cos and tan functions instead of` `% using the cosd and tand functions.` &amp;#x200B; `% Define angles` `deg = [0 15 45 180 210 279];` &amp;#x200B; `% Calculate both sides for each expression.` `cos_left = cosd(-deg);` `cos_right = cosd(deg);` `tan_left = tand(pi*180/pi-deg);` `tan_right = -tand(deg);` &amp;#x200B; `% For every defined angle, display` `for i = 1:length(deg)` `% Print lines of text with the results from the expression formatted to` `% display 4 decimals.` `fprintf('COS: for theta = %.4f left side = %.4f right side = %.4f\n',deg(i),cos_left(i),cos_right(i));` `fprintf('TAN: for theta = %.4f left side = %.4f right side = %.4f\n',deg(i),tan_left(i),tan_right(i));` `end`
It looks like this should successfully calculate a sequence of yn, but it only stores the most recent value, not the entire sequence. If you want to plot it, the easiest way to do it is to store the entire sequence in an array. You should look at the documentation on the topic of indexing and preallocation. That should explain what you need in order to have your function return the whole sequence of yn, and then you can use `plot` to plot it. 
Yup, I just copied from OP without thinking. 
https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/analysis-of-covariance.html
This is not a Matlab question. This is a statistics question.
Thanks.
What do you mean
&gt;Thank you for the detailed reproduction script. I have been testing your code on my end, and from what I can determine, the issue you are facing is caused by a known issue related to the int64 casting on the parpool indices. When I tried running the parallel pool with my reproduction script using int64 as the type value for tsteps, I also encountered the same issue you did. &gt;As a workaround, you can cast the value of tsteps in your code to int32 instead of int64. Furthermore, this issue has been resolved as of MATLAB R2018b and later versions if changing MATLAB versions is an option you are open to considering. &gt;Thank you again for your information during the course of this case. Since it seems like my suggestion should resolve your issue, I will be closing this case for now. If my suggestions do not work for you or if you have any further questions regarding this issue, please let me know and I will be more than happy to reopen this case and look into your issue further. :)
Have you tried `[start:step:end]` with `:`'s?
I’m a long time matlab user just now exploring the machine learning tool box too. I got exposed to data science-y projects using python and R. R was a pretty straightforward, just different, but I absolutely hate python. Anyway, I’m finding the matlab machine learning toolbox (and examples on mathworks) easy to follow and apply. If you understand the underlying concept of what you’re trying do I think your existing matlab skills will get you through. 
I can't use that in my case as the end value changes with each iteration, and as each iteration takes a while to run I am trying to knock it all on the head with one iteration. My start value is always 0 and the end value is worked out by a function to be a random number such as 620 so I just want around 8 integer points within that range so that a plot can be produced. Would rounding be possible and if so, how?
The end value can be a variable. Rounding is possible. Just look it up in the documentation.
Uh x = 1:10? You should probably read the first chapter in your book.
Thanks for the reply. I believe the deep learning toolbox is distinct from the machine learning one, the former being geared toward neural networks. I'd like to understand how it compares to the front-runners in this arena, such as Tensorflow. I know the performance won't be as good, but I could accept that (to a point) for an easier interface and faster prototyping.
`x=[1 1.5 0.5];` `h=10^-100;` `x1 = x;` `for j=1:3` `x1(j)=complex(x(j),h);` `f1=(x1(1)*x1(2)*sin(x1(3))+exp(x1(1)*x1(2)))/x1(3);` `dfdx(j)=imag(f1)/h;` `x1 = x;` `end` `dfdx` &amp;#x200B; Hey, I'm sorry I don't have a good answer to your question, but for future reference, formatting your code like above makes it easier for everyone to understand and respond to you!
numList = round(linspace(0,maxNum,8));
Ill try this out. Ill let you know what happends 
Hi, &amp;#x200B; I am also having the same issue! were you able to solve this? It seems impossible to contact coursera &amp;#x200B; thanks!
this won't give linearly spaced integers...
This is the correct answer. If you'd rather not specify an integer step, you can do the following check `mod(numElements,numSteps) == 0`. For example you can use linspace to break 1:10 into 20 ticks, but the number if ticks will only be an integer if the aforementioned check is satisfied.
I'm guessing you either want to use a Repeated Sequence Stair or a Signal Generator. If all else fails, use From Workspace. https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/repeatingsequencestair.html https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/signalgenerator.html
Thank you. I knew it was trivial, maybe I should have done more research on my own...
No worries. Happy to help.
I have written two (non deep) neural network matlab tutorials on my YT channel, you can grab them from my post history. When I have compared my professionally produced tensor flow (shallow) neural nets to matlabs, the performance has been similar. The only down side is the lack of certain features like batching in the default training engine, and certain filters. I'm not sure how much is fixed but the matlab cnn tools rather than stock neural network though. And yes, python drives me nuts too.
Might want to contact MathWorks directly about this one.
I think that as of the last release or two, the deep learning toolbox is finally STARTING to get decently flexible. From my experience, it can seem like the toolbox is limited to only doing a few things, but in reality it's just that getting it to do a wider variety of things requires getting way more into the nitty gritty details. But that's no different from if you were trying to work in pure tensorflow. Bottom line, the higher level / easiest tip use deep learning tools in MatLab are generally limited to the most common use cases. 
They're asking you to use [input](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/input.html) to ask the user for a number and a format string, and then you print the number they input in that format string. A format string looks something like `'4.3f'`which means "4 digits, 3 to the right of the decimal place." You can print them using [fprintf](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fprintf.html). 
Ohh. Kk In regards with the loop. I have to use a while loop do you have an idea of how to set it up?? 
Yep. Definitely that. 
I'm not sure what the termination conditions for the while loop are, here are two ways you could stop it. 1. Have it run for a certain number of iterations. Have a counter and the loop look for when the counter exceeds the desired amount Code: counterNumber = 1; while counterNumber &lt;= 10 %your code here counterNumber = counterNumber+1; end &amp;nbsp; 2. Have the code look for a specific string or numerical input with "input". When it sees that, terminate the loop Code: stopCondition = -123456789; while true %loop runs forever %your code here if inputVariable == stopCondition disp('loop termination'); break end end 
Thnx
I absolutely love the detailed documentation there is for each of the layers in the Deep Learning Toolbox. Moreover, there is also end-to-end workflow examples that guide you through formulating the deep network as well as training it. The docs definitely helps a lot and I think Keras/Tensorflow is lacking in that. Also, the toolbox have support for importing/exporting models from/to Keras, Caffe, ONNX. This area is still lacking in that not all Keras (or other types) layers can be imported currently but that support is continuously being improved.
I get an error when I run "Uh x = 1:10? " 
Your function name can't be the same as your output variable. That's what is causing the error. Name your function something more descriptive.
Looks like you've named a script `plot.m` somewhere, which conflicts with the built-in function name
I changed the name of the funciton to 'bapples' and tried to plot with this in the new script: &amp;#x200B; lambda(1:10) y = bapples(lambda); plot(lambda, y) grid on hold on &amp;#x200B; Same error as before :'( 
Did you ensure to change the name of the file as well? The function seems to work fine for me.
My advice would be to ditch Matlabs database toolbox. Spend an hour or two creating a C# class with the same exact functionality, and compile it as a .Net assembly that you can reference from Matlab. Not only will it be much more reliable than the Java based odbc driver for SQL, but it's free.
https://imgur.com/13DNTbi I don't get this at all
[https://imgur.com/a/M8AoD2I](https://imgur.com/a/M8AoD2I) &amp;#x200B; I don't get this at all how are you getting a plot and I'm not? 
Oh, on second thought - looks like you might have a function named plot.m in your working directory. If so, it will conflict with MATLAB's plot function.
Can you write which('plot.m') to Matlab command line and write us the output 
Ahh yes, you were correct. Thanks for catching that. But also (if you don't mind telling me): Why? (I'm new to MATLAB, sorry) Why does my separate . m file conflict with MATLAB's own built-in function??
https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/function-precedence-order.html
No need, solved my problem with the help of u/half_a_lime, in the previous thread
All of the MATLAB program directories are added to working path, which is what allows you to call functions. When functions have conflicting names, there's no way for MATLAB to discriminate them. Maybe you could call the function and include the full file path (not sure if this even works) but it would be a terrible workaround. You could also remove the MATLAB directories from your working path, but this is also a bad idea (since you would not be able to plot anything, for example). Common practice is just to never name functions or variables the same as built-in functions.
TIL about private functions - neat, I wonder if I'll ever find a need for them.
So I'm a little confused about your problem tbh, but if I understand correctly (without referencing your current code) you're trying to extract data at certain points in time that you have sample times for? If you have a defined sample time and it isn't just random time points you can use a while loop where you search your samples time array for a a difference in time and find the smallest difference and take the index of this value and use it on your data array. So like: Tdesired = whatever time you're looking for Ttemp = Tdesired+sampling time (to avoid issues if your start time is zéro) i = 1 While Ttemp &gt; abs (Tdesired-EEG.times(i)) Ttemp = abs(Tdesired-EEG.times(i)); i=i+1; End This loop will quit once you have the closest value to your desired time and you'll have it's index. Is this what you're trying to find? Sorry for poor formatting I'm on my phone
There are thousands of way to do this. Quantifying a continuous signal (sinus, sawtooth, etc). Repeating sequence block Signal builder Summing different steps Programming a recurrence equation that only generate with a very low sampling period Using a state flow chart Clock plus lookup table From workspace Random block with low sampling period 
i have this but its not working properly. num = input('Enter a numerical value: ' ); strg = 'Enter a format string: '; value = input(strg,'s'); fprintf(1,'%stg\\n', num)
I dont know c# :( 
I think Keras is superior for the fact that you can train using your gpu without spending several thousand on the gpu package for matlab. Keras also has excellent documentation. 
Please take a closer look at the fprintf documentation. You are now trying to print a number as a string and you are not supplying the user supplied string format (which you store in `value`) as a parameter. This might help you (bases on your own code). Now try to get the loop around it by implementing r/HuntrTrakr 's suggestions. You can use another `input` and a `strcmp` within this loop. % Ask for the numerical value. num = input('Enter a numerical value: ' ); % Ask for the format string value = input('Enter a format string: ','s'); % Add newline character to make it prettier. value = strcat(value,'\n'); % Print the numerical value in the supplied format. fprintf(value, num); &amp;#x200B;
i meant is there a way to do it in matlab?
It sounds like there are two parts to this question. First, you can pass a function handle to another function. For example, let’s say my func that I want the derivative of is: mySum=@(a,b) a+b; Now I want to pass it to your differentiation func. I would call a0=10; b0=5; dfdx=myDiffFunc(@mySum,a0,b0); Now to get your myDiffFunc to accept multiple input parameters (a and b), we’ll have to setup your function as follows function dfdx=myDiffFunc(fun,varargin) Now, within your function you can pass the params to the user specified function (known locally as fun) as follows someVar=fun(varargin{:}); Basically, varargin is a cell array that catches any additional variables that are passed to a function. Let me know if you need more explanation. 
That's good, at least we weren't just being dumb. 
I'm surprised that tout is not generated (but I've verified, and I have the same behaviour, so it's not just you ;-) ) I will try to find a better solution, and I will post it here if I find it, but in the meantime, here are two possible workarounds. 1. Modify the configuration of your "To Workspace block", to output a "struct with time" instead of "array" ("timeseries would be better, but does not work in external mode...) Instead of doing _plot(tout, humidity)_, you will have to explore the struct with timeseries and do something like _plot(humidity.Time, squeeze(humidity.signal.Values))_ (You will have both Time and values available inside the struct) 2. Use a clock block connected to a "To Workspace block". You now have a new array containing simulation time. (not very elegant, but easy to use after simulation)
I tried your second solution but the generated time array goes like 0 1 2 3 4... That's not what I had in mind at all. As the first solution, my original intention was to actually avoid working with structs.
The time saved in the clock (and it would be the same with tout, if it was working) is the time since the start of the simulation. If you get 0,1,2... it is probably because your model is setup to be at a 1 second sample time. (To verify the sample time of your model, you can use the "Display" menu &gt; Sample Time &gt; All) If you need a faster acquisition, and having for example 0,0.5,1,... you should change the sample time in the acquisition block that you use from the arduino support package. But maybe what you would like to have is the "Wall-clock" time? (Not the seconds since the start, but something like 2019-03-20 14:18") In that case, I don't think there is an easy way to do it in pure Simulink, but I guess that registering the time at the start in a variable, and adding the array that say [0 1 2 3 ,...] should do it. If you add t_start = datetime(); to the StartFcn callback of your model, you can just do (assuming that the clock saved in workspace is called "my_clock" wall_time = t_start + seconds(my_clock) in matlab, after the simulation. (or put this in a callback at the end, if you always need it)
I'm confused. It seems like you just directly want to use [unique](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/unique.html). What does it do that you don't want?
There are two built-ins called [`join`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/table.join.html) and [`union`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/union.html) that will allow you to do just about what you want. The `union` command should allow you to join two tables "vertically", while `join` will allow you to add additional variables as long as any are shared between the two tables (not clear from your explanation if you need that)... [Here's the documentation for operations with tables](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/tables.html) from MathWorks for future reference.
That's not entirely true I think. Yes, you need the Parallel Computing Toolbox for using GPUs but that's nowhere close to a thousand dollars even for commercial licenses. For Home licenses it's around 50 I believe and for Student it comes included with the student suite.
Please see our [rules for submitting homework](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/462uwe/submitting_homework_questions_read_this/). 
I've been quoted for it before and it's a substantial cost. The basic Parallel Computing toolbox is $1000. The website basically says to call for info for the Gpu toolbox pricing. So it's probably 2 or 3k total. But you're right, Home edition of any toolbox is 50 bucks, so it's not bad at all. 
Plotting is easy. Get your data, and call figure(1); subplot(2,2,1) plot(data1, data2) subplot(2,2,2) plot(data3, data4) and keep going until you fill fill the 2x2 grid. Cheers!
Starting off with plots is 100% the right thing to do. (We can get into deep learning later, though check this video out: [https://www.mathworks.com/videos/deep-learning-for-signals-and-sound-1544467789023.html](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/deep-learning-for-signals-and-sound-1544467789023.html)). &amp;#x200B; First, how is the data organized? Do you have data sets containing specific test drives? What other signals would you be using in a prediction algorithm? &amp;#x200B; Second, it sounds like you are essentially trying to calculate the jerk coefficient, and looking to find cases where it is higher or lower. &amp;#x200B; To get you started, you'll probably want to figure out where in the data an event occurs. One initial suggestion is to look into the ischange function to identify where in the data a sudden change occurs. [https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ischange.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ischange.html) &amp;#x200B; Let's assume I'm looking to find all cases within a flight that a right turn occurs: `% Find cases where yaw changes and rate is above 0` `idxRightTurn = ischange(flightYaw) &amp; flightYawRate &gt; 0;` `% To crunch through a data set, maybe something like this:` &amp;#x200B; `for ii = 1:sum(idxRightTurn)` `turnTimes = find(idxRightTurn);` `turnData(:,ii) = flightData(turnTimes(ii):turnTimes(ii)+10);` `end` `plot(turnData)` &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
I would start to plot the lateral and longitudinal accelerations as points. From this you can clearly see in the data the hard braking and accelerations as the extreme cases. By now dividing the data set into 4 regions: braking, accelerating, cornering left and cornering. I would take as dividing lines the xacc=yacc and xacc =-yacc but could play around with this. At last I would throw out the data points close to the center. Since the mean is probably 0 acc just calculate the variance of the x and y accelerations and take the average (or something more fancy) to define a circle from which you throw out all the data point which have a distance to the center less than this variance.
Thank you kind stranger, i was able to make the matlab program work!! num = input('Enter a numerical value: '); value = input('Enter a format string: ', 's'); value = strcat(value,'\n'); fprintf(value, num); flag = true; while flag; response = input('Do you want to continue y/n? ','s'); if response == 'y'; num = input('Enter a numerical value: '); value = input('Enter a format string: ', 's'); value = strcat(value,'\n'); fprintf(value, num); end if response == 'n'; disp('loop termination'); break end end 
Yup. I'm considered a design engineer here at my workplace. I'm in the telecom business and my team and I have been using MATLAB as our modeling tool of choice to model our algorithms for various products related to the LTE field. It's a great tool for quickly doing math models, plotting for presentations, and multicore number crunching. I don't do any low-end development so no need to move anywhere outside of MATLAB. &amp;#x200B; There are quite a few of us over at the discord channel (stickied here on the sub-reddit) 
I'm a consultant who uses MATLAB for signal processing and communications system design.
What's the problem you're having in importing it? Have you tried using xlsread?
Ive only been using MATLAB for a month or so, so im quite the novice. I want to accurately plot Stagnation Temps against altitude, but I dont know how to import the information from excel which has listed air temp against altitude. 
I'm a professional who uses matlab for visualization and pattern recognition applications.
Yes, use xlsread, a MATLAB command.
&gt; Have you tried using xlsread 
Thanks, Ill try give it a whirl.
This is really good. Will start with average for initial trials and then move to something more fancy. Thank you very much.
Right, bit of playing around, but how does this look? % Stagnation Temperatures at Rocket Nose R = 286 %J/kg/K Constant Gamma = 1.4 %Constant V = 1500 % m/s a = sqrt(Gamma*R*T) M = V/a numData = xlsread('myExample'); Alt = numData(:,1); T = numData(:,2); Tt = T(1+((Gamma-1)/2)*M^2) Plot(Tt,Alt) 
The dataset contains velocity, acceleration, lateral acceleration and Pitch of various test drives. I am looking for datasets with GPS coordinates. With road curvature data from GPS, To nearly predict how a driver would take on a new road. This is what's on my mind as a final step. I am a automotive engineer(dominantly from mechanical background). Deep learning seemed a feasible tool for this and I am still working out 'How'. I will look in to jerk coefficient and ischange function and learn more Thank you very much!
Have you tried it?
Set a breakpoint in the loop and see what the value of S and k are when you get the error
&gt; I tried setting v(1) = v0 (which is a given initial velocity) but it doesn't really care. &gt; I guess what I need to know how to do is how to set a v(1) for a "for loop". And then once I've done that do I do for k = 2:10 instead of 1:10? This is a perfectly reasonable approach. MATLAB uses 1-based indexing, as opposed to 0-based indexing, so the first element of an array is accessed by `myArray(1)`. Looking at your code, I have a piece of advice/info for you: anything you do *inside* the loop will be done on *every iteration* of the loop. Think about what kinds of things can be done once (perhaps before or after the loop), and what kinds of things need to be inside the loop. ;) Hopefully that gets you going again.
Try this: For n : 1:100 plot(eval(strcat('xvalues',num2str(n))),(eval(strcat('yvalues',num2str(n))))) Hold End Check that the parentheses are good (I'm on my phone) Basically you make the names into strings and then use eval to get it as variable names. 
Matlab is my main tool at work. I develop system functions and make simulations in automotive industry. 
I would try to feed this data into simulink, and then use it as a way of modelling. Apart from that, as long as you integrate properly sampled acceleration, you can get whatever movement data you want. No clue about the AI part. 
I am a scientist at a pharma company and work in MATLAB all the time. I use it to automate our experiments (data acquisition and analysis), and to score histological data (Lots of image processing and computer vision). I also write GUI's for all of this stuff so my less technically inclined colleagues can use the stuff that I write as well. Could probably do all of this in python, but I have been using MATLAB for 15 years, and speed of development was the #1 priority when it came time to start coding everything up. 
A million rows and 55 columns makes for 55 Megabytes if each entry was assigned a single byte. We know that Matlab stores data in an array as a double using 64 bits (8 bytes). This means as an array it would be 440,000,000 bytes or roughly half a gig with some overhead. The Table datatype has [loads of additional overhead](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/table.html) and take in whatever data types are necessary. If you are using the rowname property of table you've just added an extra 8 million of whatever length/type of data assigned to it. A factor of ten seems steep, but I have no idea how you are using the table and what fields you may have activated. Ideally you if the dataset is purely numeric of the same type float/long/int/etc write a class that saves/loads it as a binary file into and out of your preferred table setup. Then you can use tables interactively, but reduce your overhead as much as possible. Unless you wish to actually save the entire table which seems to be unwise given the information on hand.
Think i solved it, not used to this software at all... Bring me ANSYS/ Solidworks any day. Anyway, this has plotted the stag temps against alttitude. numData = xlsread('myResults'); Alt = numData(:,1); T = numData(:,2); R = 286; % Gas Constant (J/kg/K) Gamma = 1.4; % Heat Capacity Ratio V = 1500; % Velocity (m/s) a = sqrt(Gamma*R*T); % Speed of Sound M = V./a; % Mach Number Tt = T.*(1+((Gamma-1)/2)*M.^2); % Stagnation Temperature (K) figure;plot(Tt,Alt)
A `table` is basically a container for data (internally stored as **cell-array of columns**) along with metadata (like row/col names, descriptions, units, etc.) both encapsulated in a class that exposes fancy indexing and slicing, along with useful manipulation functions. Tables are suitable for storing heterogeneous column-oriented data: load patients; t = table(LastName,Gender,Age,Height,Weight,Smoker,Systolic,Diastolic); s = struct(t); % a way to peek inside class properties s.data % this is where the data is stored, corresponding to the patient variables In fact even if the table data is plain numeric array, it will still be split across columns stored in a cell array. Example: &gt;&gt; t = array2table(magic(5)) t = 5×5 table Var1 Var2 Var3 Var4 Var5 ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ 17 24 1 8 15 23 5 7 14 16 4 6 13 20 22 10 12 19 21 3 11 18 25 2 9 &gt;&gt; s = struct(t); &gt;&gt; s.data ans = 1×5 cell array {5×1 double} {5×1 double} {5×1 double} {5×1 double} {5×1 double} &gt;&gt; celldisp(s.data) Despite what the doc says about [fundamental types](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/fundamental-matlab-classes.html), a table is not really an intrinsic data type in MATLAB (it is defined as a `classdef` class), and thus is treated like any other class regarding [object serialization](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/save-and-load.html) (i.e a lot more overhead than a plain homogeneous numeric array).

You bet! You have to pass the arguments as a part of a cell array. When you declare val1=varargin{:}, val1 is no longer a cell array. Instead, just pass varargin{:} in to your function. If you have to declare a variable, leave it as a cell array (don’t use the {:} until you pass the cell array to the function).

it really doesn't help to just give someone the answer
i know someone already basically gave you the answer, which helps nobody btw. next time I recommend post what you have tried. You gave no indication that you tried anything yet. The instructions were pretty clear.
Could you give us a hint on what you already try? I do not know this specific toolbox. Displaying images is straightgorward with imshow function and handling clicks can be handled using a callback function. On top of that you can use tic and toc functions to measure time. Of course there are plenty of way to do this, ranging from a simple script up to a gui... 
I'm a physicist working as an aerospace analyst for the US Navy. I use MATLAB daily to perform statistical analysis, design experiments, automate simulation study workflows, apply machine learning and descriptive statistics to simulation output, plot telemetry, model systems of weapons systems, solve guidance problems, convert data formats, and make beautiful plots of to give people a clear picture of what we are up against and what we are learning so they can make good decisions.
I would start by not posting [essentially the same thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/b3dj87/2_homework_problems/) twice in a day.
I use PTB a lot and here is how I would do it. Specify a ‘rect’ in pixels where your zone of interest is, and once a click is detected, check if it falls within this rect. For instance, [0 0 500 500] would be top left corner of the screen. Function GetClicks can return x and y coordinates of the click. From there it’s a comparison and maybe an if...then statement to continue showing the image or move on to the next one. 
What you have are indexed variable names. This is very bad. You should use a cell array so that instead of 3 variables, you have one array with 3 elements, so you'd do for n = 1:3 plot(xvalues{n}, yvalues{n}); end Never create indexed variable names. The only way to handle them is through eval, and eval is horrible. 
In term of memory usage, a table containing only numbers should have a relatively low memory overhead (but there will be an overhead) Here is what I get for a 1e7x50 array vs table: Name Size Bytes Class Attributes a 10000000x50 4000000000 double t 10000000x50 4000012490 table My hypothesis here is that I don't use RowNames (and my variable/column names are called "Var1", "Var2", ..., "Var50"), and this is done using R2019a. I've done a test using a table with a fixed number of columns, and varying number of row from 1 to 10^7. As you can see in the [result table in the pdf](http://moules.org/olcc/attach/20190321101732_compare_table_array.pdf), I have a constant overhead, which is expected (the table meta data should be the same all the time, as I keep the number of column fixed, and don't use row names), so by increasing the number of lines, the ratio array size over table size tends towards 1. If I save the table and array (10^6 rows, not 10^7) in a mat file (Only the table/array by themselves, nothing else, just using "save as" with the mouse, no specific options) I get these file size: array.mat: 376225 kB vs table.mat 376229 kB.
I want to piggyback on OP's question.. Are there any rules of thumb or general best practices for when to store data in a table vs. in separate arrays? I often use tables when I have inherently tabular data, and I plan on slicing the data a lot, and using tables just makes the code a million times more readable. Typically I don't use row names, and the data columns are mostly numeric columns (a mix of floating point, logical, and integer types), as well as some cell array columns (often multidimensional, so it's not feasible to just concatenate them into a numeric column). I often wonder, though, if repeated indexing into those tables within a loop is introducing significant overhead vs. just using arrays. Do you think that's likely to be the case?

Try allocation the bigger matrix with the zeros function, yielding a matrix filled with zeros.: newmatrix=Zeros(m+1,n+1); Then: newmatrix(2:m+1,2:n+1)= oldmatrix;
I guess the part that I find confusing is that the text files I loaded them from was ~700 meg, so I figured if anything the MATLAB .mat files should be that size or smaller. I just don't get why it would store it less efficiently than plain text. 
Yes, that's not a valid name. Pick names without special characters, or use [`matlab.lang.makeValidName`](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/matlab.lang.makevalidname.html) to convert them like so: array2table(z,'VariableNames', matlab.lang.makeValidName({'f(Xn)','b','c','d','e','f'}))
Thanks. This is interesting. When I get back to my data I am going to see if I can figure out what part of my data is taking up all of the room, because by looking at this I just don't expect it to be as large as MATLAB is making it. 
Hmm that's annoying. is there a way I can create a table that looks like this with a single function: https://i.imgur.com/xzydrMF.png
As you have noticed, those names are not valid Matlab table variable names. You could use the variable description field to store the label, see here: https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/modify-units-descriptions-and-table-variable-names.html.

My general rule of thumbs is that file sizes tend to increase as you step from binary -&gt; plain text -&gt; proprietary file structures. So if you start with 700 MBytes of data you should anticipate a larger file size after running them through Matlab. The notion that you started with 700MB and ended up with a smaller sized array is curious to me. As other posters pointed out Tables are efficient at storing numeric data, but 200MB of overhead seems excessive for 400MB of numeric data. What else is in these files? I suspect that answer that question may provide insight into the ballooning resultant .mat file. 
So, the original text file was a combination of text and numbers. When I convert it into a numeric array, I use enumerations to convert the text to numbers. However, in the table, I left the text in to make it easier to read. Turns out it isn't quite as bad as I originally thought. The table is actually only 2 gb, not 5. I had two copies of the table in my workspace on accident. But still, quite a ballooning. 
I've decided to stick with the Clock block since tout seems to be out of the question. Also, the reason why I was getting a time step of 1s was because I had changed the decimation in some To Workspace blocks into 2. When I reset them into 1, I got the time step of 0.5 which is the Arduino sampling time I'm using. Thank for your answers.
What exactly are you meaning? You have three options (I'm not considering using in-MATLAB latex commands, since this would not work with your document and how you define equations, vectors, symbols, etc.) 1) psfrag. This one will require a latex-&gt;dvi-&gt;ps-&gt;pdf workflow. I believe there's a pdffrag, but I haven't tested it. The idea is that you would place simple labels like "R1" and "R2" for each item of text in your figure (from matlab). Export your image as an EPS, and then import this into latex the usual way. However, using psfrag, when you includegraphics, you can specify how you want to replace the text tags. There's a couple of alignment items to workout, but you can then have consistent fonts in your final document (and, for example, if you define vectors to be bolded, and later change to have a hat or a bar over them, this is easily accommodated without re-creating the figure.) 2) pgfplots. In this, the idea would be that you export just the data without axis or text, and load the image into pgfplots and use latex to place the axes and labels. (I will say, for simple graphs, it may be easier to just export the data as a CSV and have pgfplots load and plot the data internally. This will not be sustainable for larger data sets though.) I've done this with an exported PNG from MATLAB of 3D data, and used latex(pgfplots) to place the axes and text. \begin{tikzpicture} \begin{axis}[axis on top,title=Graphics Import] \addplot graphics % instead of the min/max things: [points={(0,1) (1,0)}, % trim=left bottom right top includegraphics={trim=12 9 12 8,clip}] {external2.png}; \addplot coordinates {(0,0) (1,1)}; \end{axis} \end{tikzpicture} Output: [http://pgfplots.sourceforge.net/example_233.pdf]( http://pgfplots.sourceforge.net/example_233.pdf ) 3) And I thought I had another idea, but its lost on me at this point. 
You make `c` a regular array in the `cell2mat` function, and then try to access `c` like it is a cell-array when you use the `{:}` command. 
&gt; {:}) Thanks for the response. But if I change it to val1=c; and then call the function with: f1=f(val1{:}) it gives me the same error but in line 9, f1=f(val1{:});
So, look at what you're doing. You have a cell array (varargin- not sure why that's a varargin, if you just need a single cell array, but ok), you turn it into a matrix when you call `cell2mat` and then you assign `val1 = c` which makes `val1` a matrix as well (since `c` is a matrix). 
Obviously tables are convenient containers that can make code more readable, but there is definitely overhead when repeatedly indexing a table inside a loop. How significant it is is a matter for you to decide (with the help of the "profiler"). The fact is MATLAB has a non-negligible overhead when calling class methods, even though it is improving with newer releases: &gt; https://stackoverflow.com/a/1745686/97160 The `table` class is no different as it implements its fancy indexing by overloading the `subsref` and `subsasgn` functions`: &gt; https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/code-patterns-for-subsref-and-subsasgn-methods.html 
Alright, I changed my code into this: function [grad]=grad(f,varargin) `h=10^-100;` `val1=varargin{:};` for j=1:length(val1) val1(j)=complex(val1(j),h); f1=f(val1); grad(j)=imag(f1)/h; val1 = varargin{:}; end grad
Actually I already manage to get latex font everywhere using this code : `set(0,'DefaultTextInterpreter','latex')` `set(0,'DefaultAxesTickLabelInterpreter','latex')` `set(0,'DefaultLegendInterpreter','latex')` So everithing on the graph looks like generated on latex (using only matlab) with math, equations and stuff. But using tex intrepeter on matlab does not allow you to "bold" the text. And I want to know if there is a way to use a command line (as I did above) to do that. &amp;#x200B;
But thank you, I will try out your idea !! 
If I make a dummy variable m: `m=val1{:}` and then call the function with: `f1=f(m)` it gives me this error: `Cell contents reference from a non-cell array object.`
One thing to keep in mind regarding `save` is the MAT-file format: &gt; https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/import_export/mat-file-versions.html By default MATLAB uses v7, which has a limitation of 2GB as maximum variable size. If exceeded (which might be happening in OP case) it uses v7.3; a HDF5-based format which is a lot more verbose and tends to be quite bigger in size especially when storing heterogeneous data (recall that tables internally store data as cell arrays of columns along with metadata). 
Ah, that I have no clue about. You could define a function that basically just sprintf's the text to prepend a \bfseries to it (or \boldmath). I use a lot of \\newcommands and to define various symbols in my tex files, and try to make sure that my plots and labels are consistent with the text. Its annoying to setup, but is then very nice to change various formatting or symbols without re-running (or even opening) matlab.
https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/cd.html 
Yes, you can use "cd", like you said.
So, if the scripts are on your [path](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/path.html) you can just reference them by script name, not requiring that you mention their location. 
There are built in solvers like ODE45, they take a little getting used to (you'll need to create a function to evaluate the derivative and give the routine a function handle. Take a look at this example [https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/solve-nonstiff-odes.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/solve-nonstiff-odes.html)
If the file is in your current folder you and is named "scriptfile.m" you can just use the command "scriptfile" which will run that script file. &amp;#x200B; If for some reason your really want to know the directory you can find it with "pwd"
What are you trying to do with line 12? You're saying f1 = f(something), but in the first line of your function, you're defining f as an input to the function. You can't really take an input and manipulate it the way you're doing in that line. You'll have to "dissect" the input f before you perform operations on it, if that makes sense.
Thanks for helping! I realized I could express my problem like this so it could be easier to understand but still helpful to me.
There is a script that converts matlab figures into tikz figures. See [matlab2tikz](https://github.com/matlab2tikz/matlab2tikz) I've been using it for drawing figures for scientific papers, specifically IEEE journals. I'd recommend it.
Ahhhh I was doing run(script) instead of run('script').
Yeah, turns out I needed to do run('script'). instead of run(script)
Maybe just go on Wikipedia and search for Runge And Kutta method and try to write the code by yourself. If it's the first time you use it, it's a good exercice :) let me know if you need help
I will have a look on this :) thanks
I'd use `fminsearch` for this- it's fairly robust for these types of problems. I've used it to piece together a cubic function which transitioned to quadratic function where 'x' was a parameter it iterated on, and it worked quite well. The nice thing about using a function like `fminsearch` is you can pretty easily enforce things like making the function continuous (although, yours is by design). 
So, I can't see your code here, and my guess is, there is an easier way. But, to answer your question, you can use the `exists` function in MATLAB. So, in psuedocode, you say: if exists('iter') iter = 0; end (that's not quite right, not at a computer with MATLAB right now, but if you type `doc exists` into MATLAB you'll get the documentation page for it. 
Just use run('C:/ThePathOfTheCode/MyCode.m'); I use it for a routine to get the figure layout I want
I'm not sure what you're asking. You need help with the arithmetic? Or you are getting a different number of results than you expect? 
Right before you call f(val1{:}), you redefine val1 as a non-cell array by calling val1=c{:}; Instead, you should just call your complex function on all of the terms at once using cellfun c=cellfun(@complex,val1,’uniformoutput’,false); Then you will have all of the now complex c values in a cell array, and you can pass that to f f(c{:})
No, you can absolutely do that if f is a function handle. 
My mistake. OP edited the post around the time I was commenting, it makes more sense now the way it is. 
You're passing a single array to a function that wants 3 inputs. 
Just need help with the arithmetic. Hoe do I instead find the total crabs caught and divide it by the number of pots. I can't seem to figure out how to sort the data to that point
I’m going to break up your graph cold, as I am on my phone and can’t keep checking which col is which. crabs=survey(:,11)+survey(:,12); pots=survey(:,4); dists=survey(:,1); Now, if I understand you correctly, for each district, you want the number of crabs in the entire district divided by the number of pots in the district. If this is correct, I would solve it as follows avgs=crabs*0; % allocate the solution array uDists=unique(dists); % get list of the districts for j=1:length(uDists) avgs(dists==uSists(j))=sum(crabs (dists==uSists(j)))/sum(pots (dists==uSists(j))); end Now you should have an array called avgs with the same number of rows as your original array, with the nub per of crabs per pot in each district.
From everything I can tell your output is correct. It looks like a step voltage applied to a DC motor with a load arm attached to the rotor? If that is the case then your output (angle) should be increasing at a (sorta) constant rate. This is exactly the output you're getting. What makes this answer incorrect?
Interesting observation. You are correct about the dc motor/robot arm part. The reason why I think its incorrect is because its different from linear system step response. Shouldn't both have similar step response? Linear system stabilizes at around 13 but non linear just increases. 
Well your linearization is likely incorrect or inaccurate. How did you get to that linearized transfer function?
I've been given some differential equations and I calculated the transfer function from there. Step response is equal to transfer function gain (numerator) of linear step response but non linear as you said keeps increasing to infinity. 
`hold on` will freeze the current figure so if you use another plot command, it will not replace the previous plot.
Mind letting me see the differential equations?
I've been using it for a while too, it really does produce utterly gorgeous output. Only downside is it doesnt work on some kinds of plots, and if your matlab figure has a lot of points it can cause pdflatex to curl up in a ball and scream like a wild creature. lualatex hacks it better
Yes, but is there a way to break it into 3 inputs?
Thank you very much for helpinngg, I will try that at my class in about an hour and give you feedback.
Thank you!

Hey man, I contacted my professor and he told me that all integrators need to have initial condition. That appears to have fixed my problem. Now, both responses are the same. Thanks for trying to help! 
**\*UPDATE\*** &amp;#x200B; All integrators need to have initial condition. That appears to have fixed my problem. 
Another update. While adding initial conditions fixed the output function, numerical values are not the same for linear and non-linear systems. Do you know what could be causing this error? It's pretty big I might add...
[I answered this question for you 20 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/aw75zx/help_with_understanding_a_matlab_function/). Since the block in question is labeled "Get the First Harmonic A", it's a reasonable assumption that it is doing exactly what it says. Where did you get this model? Have you tried asking the author for clarification? --- Since part of your question is actually about data representation in MATLAB, it bears at least a bit of explanation. You can think of multidimensional arrays by their index positions (e.g. `myArray(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...)`) kind of like the following library analogy (which breaks down the further you go...): 1. The first index is the line number on a page (the row) 2. The second index is the character position on that line (the column) 3. The third index is the page number in the book 4. The fourth index is the book number on the shelf 5. The fifth index is the shelf number in the library 6. The sixth index is the library number in the city ... and so on.
No, [as per the documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/integers.html), it rounds to the nearest endpoint, which in this case, by [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754#Rounding_rules) (under "round ties away from zero"), would round 0.5 to 1. This is consistent with the implementation of [`round`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/round.html) in MATLAB.
You can use idivide to control exactly how you want integer division to happen. The default is to round if you just use the / or ./ symbols. &amp;#x200B; [**https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/idivide.html**](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/idivide.html)
yep, for integer data types, `A./B` is the same as `idivide(A,B,'round')` where: - `'round'` rounds to the nearest integers. If an element has a fractional part of exactly 0.5, then it rounds away from zero to the integer with larger magnitude.
But int16(3)/int16(2) is 1 as expected, not 2 as you would suggest.
Your post has been removed. It is against the rules for this sub. If you ask again, you'll be banned from the sub. 
No it doesn't. On R2018a: &gt;&gt; int16(3)/int16(2) ans = int16 2
I don't understand your issue. As far as I know, the order of the data is irrelevant for fitting methods. Could you provide some additional information about the data you're trying to input.
If I may ask, what exactly do you use MATLAB for? I thought most of the development in the automotive industry are model-based and so needed simulink rather than MATLAB. Am I wrong?
I got xdat and ydat that I want to fit with the fittype 'a*(x0-x)^n-b'. As an option you can specify the starting point (a vector with as much components as the number of parameters). TheFit = fit(xdat,ydat,myfittype,startpoint,[....]); But what is the order of the parameters is that vector ? [a,b,n,x0] or alphabetical order, or occurrence order [a,x0,n,b]... Or even another one ?? ? I searched but I did not fount the answer :/ The code works but it gives fasle results because it takes the wrong initial conditions (my parameters do not have the same order of magnitude) 
According to the documentation you need to use the [coeffnames](https://www.mathworks.com/help/curvefit/sfit.coeffnames.html) function
Post the initial conditions and I can take a look
Integrator 2: fi0=-pi/3 Integrator 1: omega0=0 Integrator : Ia0=tau0/K Step - initial value: Ua0=Ia0*Ra - final value: Ua0+0.003 tau0=0.5*(M+2*m)*cos(fi0) Parameter numerical values are in .m file.

Hey, thanks for replying. Again. I hate sounding like a broken record on this one. My issue with the block is not what it does but how it does it. I am sure that the block does extract the first harmonic component but what I can't seem to get my head around is why the first harmonic is at the position in the matrix it is at. Theoretically, the matrix found when a sine wave is Fourier transformed, gives the first harmonic component at 2X1 position in the matrix. Now, if this is replicated in the FFT block in the Simulink, my issue is null and void. What I have been trying to get is a confirmation for that. I hope that clears up a bit. I found this model on an authors page on researchgate.com. And yes, I did send a message( and an email) to him asking for a clarification. Unfortunately I haven't had a reply from him yet. And finally, thanks for ELI5ing the data representation in the matrix bit again. I was able to understand that to certain extent the last time you replied, but this really makes it a whole lot clearer. Again thank you for taking the time to reply in such detail on my posts. 
Let's just look at it logically: * The extracted element is `u(2, 1, 1)`. We know this corresponds to the second row, first column, first page. Whatever is stored in those, we don't need to worry about right now (you could scope them and look if you were interested). * The block is labeled "Get the First Harmonic A". * We know that [the "first" harmonic is actually also called the fundamental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic). * The [discrete Fourier transform returns a Fourier series](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DiscreteFourierTransform.html), each term of which is an amplitude of a frequency component of the transformed signal. * Such a list of associated frequencies might go something like `{0, f, 2f, 3f, ..., Nf}`. * The second element of this particular list is the fundamental, or "first harmonic". * From the above, that's almost certainly what's being extracted in the indicated block. Now maybe we guess that the signal being passed into this subsystem has a "page" of frequencies (taken from three such pages) representing a single phase of a three phase voltage/current measurement. Then we might guess that the columns are time samples. That would give us a pretty nice fit. But this is entirely guesswork, because we didn't make it, and I can't even see the rest of the model. If you don't trust it, you could always do it yourself!
[removed]
You are right. Most of the time I use Simulink, but I also do some signal processing from measurements. I estimate multiple transfer functions, state spaces, bode plots. Also multiple tools I use must be written and maintained in MATLAB. For example based on measurement and the linearized model of the system I must identify multiple parameters of it. To do that I have a tool that I wrote with gui. We don't have all the toolboxes like at the university, because they are very expensive, so many functions need to be created as a substitute of those toolboxes. Sometimes I also use python for symbolic math.
Oh.. I will have a look at it thanks a lot for your help 
It looks like "ezplot" returns a Contour graphics object, so you should be able to use its "ContourMatrix" property to get the data that you're looking for: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/matlab.graphics.function.functioncontour-properties.html#d117e759743 As an example, syms x y f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 h = ezplot(f == 1); C = h.ContourMatrix; C(:, 1) % As per documentation, first column of C contains "meta-data" x = C(1, 2:end); % Grab actual contour x-data y = C(2, 2:end); % Grab actual contour y-data close plot(x, y);
Thanks for your response! But currently I did something like this: (I stopped using ezplot because of the warnings I got and started using fimplicit) f = symfun(...,[x,y]); h = fimplicit(f,[-lim lim]) %lim small enough x = get(h,'Xdata'); y = get(h,'Ydata'); And this seems to work fine, except that I still have to plot it first. Which might have it's problems aswell... 
Nice one! I've used "fimplicit" in the past for this exact kind of problem, but completely forgot about it :) &gt;&gt; fp = fimplicit(f == 1); &gt;&gt; x = fp.XData; &gt;&gt; y = fp.YData; &gt;&gt; plot(x, y);
Try a [scatter3](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/scatter3.html) plot where the color is time. To find the peak acceleration, you can use [ peakAcc , timeIndAtPeak] = max( sqrt(sum(m(:,2:4).^2,2)) )
As an alternative solution, I've used a program I found on the file exchange for this purpose: [C2xyz](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/43162-c2xyz-contour-matrix-to-coordinates). I also use `contourc` to generate the contour matrix without generating a plot. For example: C = contourc(x,y,Z,[0 0]); if ~isempty(C) [xcont,ycont]=C2xyz(C); end Then xcont and ycont are cell arrays of size n, where n is the number of distinct contours (for instance, if the level surface is not connected). 
Thanks! I was actually having a think and wanted to change what I was doing. So I was thinking that I want to use columns 2, 3 and 4 to calculate total acceleration; and plot that against the 1st column which is time. Do you know how I'd do that? Sorry my knowledge is so basic lol 
Np! Try: totAcc = sqrt( sum(m(:,2:4).^ 2,2) ); time = m(:,1); figure; plot( time , totAcc );
Ahh thank you so much, you're an absolute star!
figure() subplot(2,2,1) title("Plot 1") subplot(2,2,2) title("Plot 2") subplot(2,2,3) title("Plot 3") subplot(2,2,4) title("Plot 4")
Not sure if that is possible without doing some hacking. But, one easy alternative is “set( gcf , ‘Name’ , ‘My Title’ );”. This should stay even if you reload the figure from a saved .fig
For matlab r2018b or later, you can use [sgtitle](https://fr.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2018b/matlab/ref/sgtitle.html)
You probably have too many output variables. 
I'm using tool. So how can I change that? I mean I should get output for 8 variables
Please start by posting your code and more detail about what you are doing. 
 function y = genetic (x) y=1000000+2000000+1500000+300000+500000+350000+3*x(1)+4*x(1)*0.6+3*x(1)*0.6*0.3+8*x(2)+40*x(3)+4*x(1)*0.6*0.2+4*x(1)*0.6*0.3*0.35+2*x(2)*0.15+80*x(4)+15*x(1)+8*200*x(1)+8*150*x(2)+3*150*x(5)+8*100*(x(3)+x(6))+8*50*(x(7)+x(8))+20*(x(3)+x(6)-x(7)-x(8))+60*(10000-x(7)-x(6)+500-x(8)); end This is the fitness/objective function for my problem.
And?
Put them all inside a uipanel &amp;#x200B; clf(figure(gcf)) hp = uipanel(gcf,'Title','These are four graphs showing blah blah blah',... 'Bordertype', 'none',... 'TitlePosition', 'centertop',... 'FontSize', 14); subplot(2,2,1,'parent',hp) plot(randn(1,100)) title('plot one') subplot(2,2,2,'parent',hp) plot(randn(1,100)) title('plot two') subplot(2,2,3,'parent',hp) plot(randn(1,100)) title('plot three') subplot(2,2,4,'parent',hp) plot(randn(1,100)) title('plot four') &amp;#x200B;
 The lower bound for all the variables is 100 and the upper bound is 10000 For the constraints: A is [X(1) X(3)+X(6) X(2) X(6) X(7)] b is [15000 50000 X(1) X(2) X(3)]
Please share your code. All of it. The above bit you shared tells us absolutely nothing. 
I'm sorry I'm very new to this. There is no code except this. From what my professor told this is all I needed if I use optimtool. So this is all I have. If you don't mind can you tell what is it that I'm missing because from what I see I don't need any other data for running optimtool
[https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/sgtitle.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/sgtitle.html)
Add a static function that generates a random number and selects a color in a simple if statement.
Other DSP experts may have better ideas than I, but I think essentially what you’ll need to do is first put the signals into the frequency domain using the fft function, filter into the bandwidth regions you (probably a million ways to do this-there is a bunch of built in filter functionality in the dsp toolbox), and then measure the magnitude in each frequency bin (if that’s your ultimate goal). Matlab also has a built in spectrogram function that will let you get an idea visually of what your end outputs should be. If this isn’t for an assignment, there are definitely functions that already exist that can do this for you. 
So a static function to rng between 1-3 and associating the enumeration to a number like so?: 1-A 2-B 3-C Randi(3) Kind of?
Amazing
I would try this. x = {‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’}; c = Color.(x{randi(3)})
I imaged something like this, using /u/nodgeOnBrah's code: ``` classdef Color enumeration A B C end methods (Static) function c = Random() x = {‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’}; c = Color.(x{randi(3)}); end end end ``` You can use this like `Color.Random()`.
Nice thats PERFECT!!
In addition to the now built-in command sgtitle which others have referenced, you can also use [suplabel](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/7772-suplabel) from the file exchange, for instance if you have an older version. 
You might want to look into the FieldTrip toolbox. It's a free/open source toolbox for MATLAB specifically designed for EEG/MEG signal processing and analysis. I find it very intuitive and easy to use, could be useful for you as well.
This does individual plots I think they want one title for the figure
Check out the profiler, and the `profile` function.
Here's what I've found: tau0=0.5(M**-**2m)*cos(fi0)**\*L\*g** (correction in parameters) Since the system is already linearized about -pi/3, the step into the linearized TF should be 0 -&gt; 0.003 If you directly compare the outputs of your functions you should see that at the instant of the step both outputs are very similar. They diverge very quickly due to the fact that the linearized system is only valid near the operating point -pi/3. Physically it makes sense since you perturb the physical system (a robotic arm at steady state) this perturbance makes the chaotic nonlinear system behave erratically and shifts the final position to a new steady state value. The linear system has no nonlinear properties so behaves exactly as a linear system should to a small perturbance - just a small step input. Let me know if this is satisfactory or if you need any further explanation.
You could construct an index vector. I don't have Matlab in front of me so I'm trying to piece together pseudo code in my head here, but you'd start with just `(1:10)` then apply repmat to make it into an Nx10 matrix, then bsxfun to multiply by `[1, 3, 5,...]`, then stretch it out into a vector. 
Wow thanks. I have 1 question. Is there a way to make both outputs the same? 
From your description, it seems you want to divide the vector into two. One with every 10th number and the other with the rest. This is not sorting. You can make the first vector by simply writing something like y = x(1 : 10: end). Where x is the original vector. The second vector can be easily constructed and I would leave it for you to figure it out since this is a HW question. PS: sorry for the formatting. I am on mobile 
In this case no there is no way to make the outputs behave the same. Out of curiosity what course is this for? Have you learned any nonlinear system analysis?
Yep, I see that now. Thanks!
I think you mean LabChart software? But you can export it as a text file and then perform PSD functions. Eeglab is a free package for some of this analysis but seems like overkill, as it has a learning curve itself. Sounds like you need to do your homework. It appears you've done barely any research on how to do this.
I'll give it a try thanks for pointing me in some direction!
Right right, it's the Labchart software. And I've to submit my homework by tomorrow! ಠ\_ಠ I'll use Eeglab and see if it helps. Thank you.
I actually think this is probably due to the mathematics by your use of vpasolve. I would venture to think that numeric solver is finding another mathematically viable solution that is not physically possible because the solution isn’t being constrained appropriately. Is there a constraint you can set on the variables that would eliminate that option for the solver? Are you getting any warnings when you plot?
I would tend to agree with you until more details are provided. I read on the vpasolve reference page that you can add an initial guess as input. I would use the last known value (i.e. R(i-1) ) as initial guess, to make sure that the search begins close to the expected value. OP I would gladly help you more if provided more info (values of e, La, etc.)
I use type('function_name')
Try to think about how you can generate the following pattern: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... So, 10 zeroes followed by 10 ones, followed by 10 zeroes, etc.
Automation. The reason Im asking is because in a previous example both linear and non linear outputs were the same. 
The step() command should do exactly what you are looking for! Check out the Matlab help for the input arguments :) 
thank
Wait to the day before and then post on Reddit to try to get answers because you have no idea. My chemistry teacher used to tell me "don't get caught with your pants down".
Sure I will try using it. Thank you.
I know, right ? :p
Just curious, how does impulse() not give you what you want for the impulse response? If impulse() isn't giving you what you want, step() won't either...
So one thing: in Matlab if you want a numeric output, like you do here, don't use symbolic math. MATLAB is terrible at symbolic math. It's slow, it's clunky, and it's numeric solvers are way better. Just keep in numeric and use fzero
Where am I using symbolic math? Vpasolve isnt a numeric? Instead of symbolic?
No, any warnings. I will try putting constrains.
e is \[0,0.05,0.1,0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8,1,1.5,2\] and La=1:1:200 How do I constrain the variables?
But i know the function, as the intended graph shows need to be decreasing
`vpasolve` finds the numeric solution of a symbolic equation. Where something like `fsolve` or `fzero` give numeric solutions to numeric equations- aka no `syms` required. 
Use plot() to plot two lines. Use axis to set the limits on the axes. Use grid() to turn on the background grid. 
I know what function in each range but I don't know how to code it. 
Play around a bit with plot(). What does plot([0 2 1]) look like? What does plot([0 2 5], [0 2 1]) look like? Why?
This worked marvelously! Thanks
