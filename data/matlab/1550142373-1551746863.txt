It's not really clear what you're trying to do here. Simply shifting an image laterally is pretty easy to do. Are you saying you want to automatically detect these image features? That can be extremely difficult. 
That method works because it returns a matrix without a unique solution. You don't have to do a psuedoinverse to get to reduced row echelon form. There probably YouTube videos out there on this
If its your first matlab course, they probably expect the dozen if statements. Better to go with it and not turn in something too weird. 
Thanks. I've read some examples of how people track objects and points. Seems fairly intuitive. I think the global coordinate tracking in the space is more the challenge.
It's digital image correlation. I have a rigid body with a few points on it. I'm focused on the center point and as the body moves, I want to know the coordinates of all those points and detect if there are any distance changes from the center point to the others.
But I already know how to do that... I like to challenge my knowledge by learning new techniques
That's pretty close to how I solved the problem. I'm posting my solution in the event anyone ever sees it. Thanks!
Here's how I solved my problem, in case anyone ever sees this. &amp;#x200B; (Before this snippet, both the Maximum HR and Current HR are calculated) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; RangeTable = {0,.60,.70,.80,.90; 'Below Level','Weight Loss','Cardio','Anaerobic (Hardcore)','Above Level'} &amp;#x200B; for RangeIndex = 9:-2:1 if CHR &gt;=cell2mat(RangeTable(RangeIndex))\*MHR newline; disp("Exercise Intensity Level: ") disp(RangeTable(RangeIndex+1)) break end end &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
You can also type ‘open variablename’ in the command window. 
This is nearly impossible to answer without seeing the function. Can you identify any operations which would cause error?
I’m using matlabFunction to convert a symbolic matrix into a function so that I can generate said matrix numerically. There aren’t any operations other than the ones that matlabFunction is generating. The matrix itself consists of high degree polynomials and possibly rational expressions.
x = *r* cos(theta) y = *r* sin(theta)

Pretty sure you have to renew all matlab licenses annually(?) Unsure about putting it on multiple machines...would have thought that would defeat the purpose of a license...So probably not. 
Yes you have to renew it every year. About multiple machine I have no knowledge because I only have one laptop.
You can put it on two machines at maximum (two machine changes per year). If I'm not mistaken, the licence is forever, you just won't get upgrades (though this may only apply for older versions like R2010, which I'm using)
I can second that these subscriptions are forever for two computers but they don’t give you the biannual upgrades. I can also say that they will send emails to the student account to re-confirm your student status after a while. If you graduate and lose access to the email account, they will lock your license.
Ohhh I see. Okay, thank you!
Would the basic student bundle be good or the vip package for 99 that includes a bunch of add ones?
Would the basic student bundle be good or the vip package for 99 that includes a bunch of add ones?
I mean it depends on if you use the add-ons or not because if you use at least two, it's pretty worth it. I do use the curve fitting and optimization toolboxes for my work (well I did when I bought it) but the biggest selling point is Simulink. If you don't expect to do any control systems or engineering then just get the standard.
The packages can be very useful depending on what specifically you're doing. Sometimes a tool you think should be built into the base Matlab is actually in a toolbox, which can be frustrating if you don't have it. They hook you in with the inexpensive student license: you'll write code that you don't even realize is using toolboxes, until you try to run it at work or somewhere that doesn't have the toolbox.
It expired for me after my graduation year (which I dumbly gave to the program.. somehow). If it asks you, Graduate in 2070. 
Just try using a screen capture or the snipping tool. This always comes out with better resolution than exporting through matlab. 
How are you trying to save this figure? Are you using a command, like [print()](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/print.html), or doing it manually?
Manually
Just define it with an if statement instead 
From the Mathworks [website]( https://www.mathworks.com/store/faq#student ) &gt; For how long can I use student software? &gt; &gt;You can use student software indefinitely. After you graduate you may need to purchase a professional license. You just won't get the annual update refresh. To be honest, after having gone through this, if its just basic stuff, you'll be better off learning [Julia]( http://julialang.org ) as its mostly Matlab compatible syntax, and free. Python (and scipy / bumpy) is also a good option, but it takes much more of a learning curve coming from MATLAB style syntax. 
Below is a comprehensive list of all the good reasons to use the symbolic toolbox. --end of list Seriously just use an if/else block. 
If you have access to Antenna Toolbox then your life will be simple. 
`plot3`
I would use the saveas function and export the image to eps. That's encapsulated postscricpt that you can later export to a hi res jpeg. You can also use the saveas function to export a jpeg to a certain DPI. Check out the Mathworks website for more information
When I tried that I just a blank plot with no data points.
https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export_fig
so a few separate problems: you initialize xyuv and z as 1:N, which means each of them are equal, and their values are \[1,2,3,4,5,....10\^4\] and then you go in and rewrite them. So redundantly, you then set xyzuv(1) = 1, which it already was. Might want to do something like x = zeros(1,N); instead of 1:N, then the rest. Were you trying to watch it live as it goes? Why not do all the calculation first, then plot2(x,y,z) what you want at the end, either as a path, or a step by step animation if you want. pause(#seconds) might be helpful. Usually it won't plot until there's a pause in the action. Might want to start with a step size of like 10, watch it run using break points, see that it's doing what you want, before jacking up the size. You might also try scatter3(), and maybe using the arguments for point type like plot(x,y, 'rx') for red x's. also maybe leave some % comments so we know what the variables are meant to be &amp;#x200B;
I had no idea what this was, but looked it up and I am fascinated by it. There is a pde solver on MATLAB which you can use to compute strain from a static system. The modifications done each iterations would have to computed manually.
TIL
Thanks for the help so far. My plan is to watch it live and compile it as a GIF eventually, but right now I just want an overall trajectory. It's now compiling, but it's just a blank 2d plot with no data points.
Static methods are often used to create utility functions. And yes, it can be called from anywhere, as long as you use the fully qualified name `MyClass.MyStaticFunction()`
 set(gcf, 'PaperPositionMode','auto') print -djpeg -r0 out.jpg 
Or rather MyClass::myStaticFunction();
You want to plot a point in 3D space and you are actually doing it. However, the default behaviour of plot3 is to draw a line, but this line is only in one point and therefore very hard to see. Like was mentioned by the previous poster you can change the way Matlab plots points. Examples, plot(1,1) % will produce a very small dot at x=1 and y=1 plot(1,1,’o’) %w Will produce at circular marker at x=1 and y=1 I think plot3 takes the same kind of additional input as the normal plot function does. But you can read the documentation for that. 
Just to be sure, if you are a student, you could check first if your School/University have a campus wide license, if not done already. If it has this type of license, you can install and use MATLAB on your personal computer for free (from your point of you) In that case, the license will have to be renewed every year (basically you will need to prove that you are still a student probably by showing that you still have access to a student email account)(also I'm assuming that the University don't decide to terminate it's license agreement) If not, then the answer to your question is there: https://www.mathworks.com/store/link/faq#student But to summarize: If you buy today, you will be able to use it forever, but not to install new version after one year. So you should have access to to the current and previous versions (up to R2018b), and then the version published in the next 365 days (that should be R2019a and b) but not to the following versions (R2020a and later)
You could de-couple the plotting from the rest of the code. After the for-loop, just call: plot3(x,y,z) grid on; axis vis3d; xlabel x; ylabel y; zlabel z; If you want, you can replace the `plot3` call with `comet3` for a small animation. If you wanna create a GIF, you could use `animatedline` inside a loop to create the frames and capture them in a GIF animation. 
Let me give you an example that uses vecitization, so suitable for different solvers: Dydt=(y&gt;0)*y.^2+(y&lt;=0).*y.^3;
You can use matlabFunction to convert your symbolic function to a function handle that can be used in ode45 https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/matlabfunction.html However, you didn't have to create the piece wise function using symbolic math in the first place. You don't even have to use if-else loop (this would be much easier though since you are new). You could use logical indexing instead. See Walter's comment here https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/90014-how-we-can-define-piecewise-function-in-matlab If you plan on using MATLAB for long, do get yourself familiarized with logical indexing. It'll come in handy a lot.
What're you trying to embed the figure into? There's often better solutions than jpeg
The matlab compiler toolbox will do that for you. 
I don't know about Antenna Toolbox, but a finite element model will probably serve you better. Something like COMSOL. 
Sometimes. 
Don't use the print function it is not as portable as it should be. Saveas is much better. 
Will also be very simple without. This is not really Antenna related apart from the application. 
Finite element is probably not suited to this, fresnel / Fraun is probably better. 
but how do i do it? like what is the code for it? i mean how do i go about ? could you please help me out
but how do i do it? like what is the code for it? i mean how do i go about ? could you please help me out
HFSS is the industry standard FEM suite for antenna design. It costs about $100k. COMSOL can do the same thing and is cheaper - not sure what else is available. In fact, COMSOL has a patch antenna model built into the application builder as an example which could be extended to OPs geometry, most likely. You can get out dBi, EIRP, investigate port impedance matching and all that good stuff. 
I am aware of this. I have two matrices that when added together should give me another matrix to machine precision. When I check the relationship using subs with my symbolic matrixes it is exact. But when I use matlabFunction to generate the matrices numerically the relationship only holds to about 6 decimal places which is quite awful. I don’t believe changing the vpa accuracy will affect anything since matlabFuncrion works in doubles.
Hm I am sorry this is a mess, I'm on the phone. I wrote the code giving it 4 spaces thought it didn't really considered as such.. 
Yep, I ran into this too. I ended up re-writing a ton of tools afterwards because they weren't in base matlab. Matlab does a very good job of obscuring what you're using.
- https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/recognize-and-avoid-roundoff-errors.html - https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/increase-precision-of-numeric-calculations.html When converting symbolic expressions that suffer from internal cancellation or round-off errors, increase the working precision using `digits` for more accurate conversion. I think this includes code generated by`matlabFunction` when converting to double-precision.
check `edit saveas.m`, it just calls `print` internally. All these function eventually end up calling the undocumented function `hardcopy`. (`hardcopy` is mentioned [here](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/99925-why-does-the-screensaver-get-captured-when-i-use-getframe-on-a-matlab-figure-window-while-creating-a)) 
Hello, I've conceptualized my problem a bit more, and I wanted to run it by you. Essentially I have two probability distributions, my porosity data is normally distributed and my permeability is log-normally distributed. So, what I'm actually trying to do is to pick a random number from my porosity distribution. From that number, lets say it's within +/- 1 standard deviation from the porosity mean, then I want to select a random permeability that's within +/- 1 standard deviation from the permeability mean. Likewise, if a porosity is selected that is within +1 to +2 standard deviations from the porosity mean, then I want to select a random permeability that is also within +1 to +2 standard deviations from the permeability mean. If the porosity is -1 to -2 standard deviations from the porosity mean, then I want to select a permeability that is -1 to -2 standard deviations from the permeability mean. This is how I figure it should look: 1) Select random of porosity based on it's normal probability distribution 2) if porosity is &lt; or = to +/-1 σ (plus/minus one standard deviation of porosity) then select a random permeability that is within +/-1 σ (plus/minus one standard deviation of permeability) if porosity is &lt; or = to -2 σ then select a random permeability that is within -2 σ if porosity is &lt; or = to +2 σ then select a random permeability that is within +2 σ if porosity is &lt; or = to -3 σ then select a random permeability that is within -3 σ if porosity is &lt; or = to +3 σ then select a random permeability that is within +3 σ 3) Print out the selected porosity and permeability in two cells (that I can copy and paste from) 4) Apply e^x to permeability to convert back into the appropriate units 5) Repeat process x number of times An issue I'm having is that two standard deviations less than the porosity mean enters negative numbers, which doesn't make sense. How would I go about addressing this? This is what I've done so far with the "coding": number_of_runs = 1200; for n = number_of_runs for i = random(pdpor); if i &lt;= 0.0265 AND &gt;= 0.0975 perm = random I know this is not complete, but like I said, I am trying to slowly learn and your help would be greatly appreciated. I've entered my two probability distributions as pdpor and pdperm. Basically what the code says (or what I want it to say) is that if my random value for porosity is within 1 standard deviation (0.0265 to 0.0975) then I want to select a random permeability that is within 1 standard deviation. I am not sure how to write the command in the latter part of my previous sentence, or if there's a way to refer to the standard deviations from my distributions rather than writing the exact numbers. After that part of the code, I imagine there would be an else if statement which would say something like else if pdpor &lt;= 0.0265 (-1 standard deviation) then pdperm would randomly be selected as a value that is less than one standard deviation from the permeability mean. Then an else statement that says if pdpor &gt;= 0.0975, then pdperm value would be randomly selected as a value greater than +1 standard deviation from the permeability mean. I would like to expand this (as shown in my written algorithm) to include random porosity values that are greater/lesser than three standard deviations, but I'm not sure if this is necessary, especially when knowing the issue that two standard deviations less than the porosity mean enters negative values. Thanks again for reading through this, I hope it all makes sense. The reason I am doing it this way rather than a linear regression approach is because my porosity and permeability data doesn't follow the normal linear relationship (an artifact of the specific rock type I am studying). But, it still would not make sense to have a highly permeable rock with nearly zero porosity.
Assuming you aren't asking how to tune the gains, and are just asking how to implement it. You need to break down the PID to its basic components using a differential and integrator block. Then you can multiply the states (x, integral(x) and dx) by your desired value of the gains from a secondary system (where you have mapped out the gains needed, I would recommend a lookup table) and just add them all up
The default value of digits is 32. It doesn’t make sense that 32 digits is not significant enough to fix round off error in double precision.
My guess is that your model takes twice as long to compute as your base sampling rate, so everything is slowed down by roughly a factor of two. Arduinos are great, but they're also only 8 bit machines running at 16 MHz - It's fine, but it's slow. My suggestion would be to divide your code based on the necessary sampling rate of each function. Your LCD probably doesn't need to update at your base rate. Put it in a subsystem that executes at a tolerable rate - like 0.1 seconds. See if your loop still functions as intended. If your model isn't reporting the sample rate, you can use a constant block and a weighted sample time block to measure the turn around time. The measured turn around time divided by your set sample rate gives you a rough estimate of CPU loading.
Just define values for A, k and θ. Now define G=A*cos(k*θ) where your θ goes from -180 to 180. So define it as θ=-180:1:179 (as -180 and 180 are the same). This should give you the G function modelled on MATLAB. Now if you convert it to dB scale you should get your angle corresponding to 3dbi value using comparison
With some checking though. 
Indeed this to me doesn't sound like he needs anything in terms of antenna design software. 
First define what you want to do mathematically. 
I think it may best practice to explicitly gather() the data from the GPU to avoid such a situation. This allows you to control what data you are using in your loop. Otherwise it sounds like you are asking if Matlab is smart enough to compare a gpuArray to it's gathered counterpart and know when to gather again as it is called. I assume it would gather again by default. The only way I can think to check for this behavior is to time it out with tic/toc. Benchmark your current code and then use explicit gather statements to see if it is faster. Of course, such speed difference may be negligible depending on the size of the arrays involved.
This is right. The whole model of gpuArray is that a gpuArray object stays in gpu memory until you explicitly gather. So, it’s up to you to manage the lifecycle of variables in gpu memory with control flow.
This post led me down the right track, the inherited sample rate would have been 0.01 from the throttle feed. I've dialled it back to 0.2 on the runs into the LCD subsystem and it's fixed the problem. Thank you.
If you are using simulink, the way to dynamically change the value of a gain would be to use the 1D lookup table. 
You can't directly change the internal step size, but you can force it to start with a different step size, which will change subsequent step sizes, and you can also limit the max step size. Try using something like: opts = odeset('MaxStep', 1, 'InitialStep', 0.01); [T,Y] = ode113(deq1,[0 30],[50 10], opts); When I run that with `a = b = c = d = 1` I get a lovely, smooth plot. You can tune the max and initial steps to your liking. You can also give it a full vector of points instead of just the start and end points (e.g. `0:0.1:30` instead of `[0 30]`), which will cause it to change step size, though not necessarily to exactly what you provide. See [the documentation for `ode113`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ode113.html) and the [documentation for `odeset`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/summary-of-ode-options.html) for more info.
Yeah I know about that option to just provide your vector with exact steps to compute. Although I'm not sure if it's optimal as ode methods in Matlab compute variable step sizes so I guess this might have some effect on result. When I look on the Web for examples of phase planes for Lotka-Volttera I can see images like [this](https://mathecolic.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/lotkavolterraphase1.jpg). And it's pretty smooth. So I don't know if I'm doing something wrong. My vars are a=2 b =0.2 c=1 d=0.1 by the way. Using 1 for all of them gives me a smooth output but in different shape obviously. Thank you for your response /u/angrmgmt00 
You're welcome.
+ Thanks a lot !
+ /u/wg90506 Thanks a lot ! 
My advice: 1. Spend more time thinking about your problem. Most likely you still should not be inverting this matrix. Without knowing more about your problem, I would think about what information you need to get from the entries in the inverse. Is this information you can get cheaper? Are they specific entries you need to look at or all of them? 2. If you finish thinking about this and can't determine how to get your data without inverting it, I would describe this problem to a peer or advisor and discuss ways to avoid inverting the matrix. 3. If together you have concluded you actually need to invert the matrix (probably you are still both wrong, but it might be difficult to see), then first check if W is nice enough to compute the inverse via the following theorem. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neumann_series If so then you can compute that series one time by getting a Jordan decomposition for W first and then scaling it appropriately by rho. 4. If all else fails, then you can still get a large speedup over calling "inv" since your matrix has a very specific form: I-rhoW. Compute an LU factorization for W which only has to be done once. Then write a faster inverse for your type of matrix using *\eye(N). 
The way I would approach a problem like this when it comes to computation speed is I would look at the code that performs the inverse function and find out how many computations it has to complete in order to provide an output. If you can find a different way to invert it with fewer computations, you have a more efficient operation. 
Define "completely different". 
One answer was +7. The other was -6 lol
Oh well that seems fishy. Are they both runga kutta methods? They should represent the true solution but with different error margins. The order if the error is different for different RK methods. 
Forcing your own step size instead of an ODE solvers variable step size won’t change the result if your step size is small enough (if your ODE isn’t stiff, which it isn’t), it will just increase the compute time. So it is definitely worth trying.
You need to place an electrical reference as well as a solver configuration block in your system. For the measurements you are looking for a PS-Simulink Converter. This will make the physical signal into a data type which can be read by a scope. The input to the controlled source should have a Simulink-PS Converter which will turn a simscape signal into a physical signal which can control the voltage source.
So when ode113 solves your equations, it is solving them in time-sequential order. When you then plot Y1 vs Y2, you are connecting the dots so to speak in time-sequential order also because that’s the order of the elements in Y. Try plotting with dots or circles instead of a continuous line, and if that works then perhaps there is a way to sort your Y array to plot it as a smooth line.
Yep one is the Heun method and one is the mid point method. I'm really not sure what's happening haha. One produces a negative gradient and the other is positive.
As far as the Von Neumann sum goes, the largest eigenvalue of W is 1, and the rhos should have absolute value less than 1, so while the infinite sum of rho*W is defined (and is actually why I need the inverse of I-rhoW) I’m not sure that I can compute it initially for just the Ws and then scale unless there is some work around. Can I just compute this sum for something like .5, and then multiply this sum by 2*rho for each rho I draw in the Monte Carlo? I need the elements of the inverse of this matrix because it is essentially a matrix of derivatives, on spillover effects in a network. We’re interested on what are the specific spillovers between each of the individual nodes.
Seems weird. Post the code and maybe we can figure something out
 What's your step size?
Would a faster route to inversion be diagonalization, or is that how inv calculates the inverse? i.e. A = V^-1DV
0.004
is there is any tutorial or something that will get me familiar with things you said ? 
Okay, that is odd
[Here](https://youtu.be/SK7ZKzELPK8) is a video which walks through constructing a simple circuit. [Solver configuration](https://www.mathworks.com/help/physmod/simscape/ref/solverconfiguration.html) [PS-Simulink Converter](https://www.mathworks.com/help/physmod/simscape/ref/pssimulinkconverter.html) [Simulink-PS Converter](https://www.mathworks.com/help/physmod/simscape/ref/simulinkpsconverter.html)
Sorry I think I get it now. So I would do something like this: [P,D] = eig(W); And then for each rho I would do: R = P*diag(1./(1-rho*diag(D)))/P; Thanks your suggestion was very helpful!
Does twitching the step by a relatively small amount (~10%) cause the solution to change considerably, by any chance?
I will have a look but the time step I have to use is 0.004
In addition to this you should note that your compile errors are likely also coming from not having a Solver Configuration block attached which is necessary for Simscape models. 
Are these main brand arduinos or off brand? Also have you already upload code from the arduino IDE to test them?
&gt;when I try to upload a Matlab server on the arduino board I am not sure what this means. Was this part of some kind of how-to you are following? If so, would you mind sharing that? &amp;#x200B; Also, just FYI, sometimes you need appropriate permissions to allow MATLAB to access external hardware devices. It would be worthwhile to just run it as administrator on your Mac and see if that changes anything. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Main brand. Part of a partnership kit with mathworks. And yes 
I’m confident you’ll get it working. I’ve done it before (and it was a pain to set up). I don’t quite remember the process though. I will try to look for my code today. 
Matlab interacts with an Arduino board by uploading a server onto it. But it finally worked on windows for some reason. Idk wtf
Finally worked on windows, I don't know what is up. I wonder if matlab is not an identified developer by apple. 
Your second method is called Heuns method which is second order accurate. Your first method is like nothing I've seen before but it looks first order so even with a step size of 0.004 it's possible to get different results. I would plot both solutions on top of each other and make sure that at least your initial conditions match. Then I would compute the first two iterations by hand and make sure that your code is producing what you think it should. 
What does this mean? The Lorenz equations are a 3D vector field so I don't know what +7 or -6 are supposed to mean here. Your "answer" from any ODE integrator should be a sequence of vectors in R^3. 
Yes I did get X, Y and Z coordinates, I was just giving the two X coordinates. The Y and Z ones were also very different.
This difference is after a single timestep or a longer integration? 
Iterating from 0 to 40, time step 0.004.
Well yeah... You're simulating a chaotic system. Chaos is literally defined as where tiny differences can snowball into huge differences down the line. Also first-order integration methods tend to be pretty inaccurate regardless. Two things to check: 1. How do they perform on a simple problem? 2. If you integrate the Lorenz equations for a long time, do the plots look similar? I.e. are you seeing attractors in the locations that analytic theory would predict?
Actually if I recall there is a guidata() function that refreshes data once the callback triggered Check documentation for more details 
You can specify the parallel pool Matlab uses via the [parpool() command](https://www.mathworks.com/help/distcomp/parpool.html). Calling this from the command line should return the default setting showing you how many workers(cpus) are available. Additionally, you can directly set this via the [parfor() command](https://www.mathworks.com/help/distcomp/parfor.html) itself by passing in the number of workers. Depending on your setup, Matlab can do any number of things but it cannot exceed what the computer/node allows it to access. If you run a job manager, Matlab will be capped by that, OR whatever it sees on the local machine. In those instances calling parfor() without specify a cluster or number of workers will grab ALL, no matter if other resources are dedicated to them outside of Matlab. If your server has multiple nodes Matlab may not be able to run jobs across all nodes. You would need to check without System Admin if you have the necessary packages to support Matlab functioning in that manner.
There are several tools that you can use to verify which cores are being used. If you have a GUI then KSysGuard is one, maybe top would work too.
Put a breakpoint in your script on the "convertTime(timeformat,h,amorpm);" line. You will see that getInputs() hasn't actually created any variables! There are nothing called "h", "m", "s", "timeformat" or "amorpm". Why? Because you don't create them. These variables only exists inside the function. So when you call convertTime(), Matlab correctly notices that a variable named "timeformat" doesn't exist (it existed in the function, but it doesn't exists in the script). If you want them in the script as well, you have to create them as well. [my_h, my_m, my_s, my_timeformat, my_amorpm] = getInputs(); convertTime(my_timeformat, my_h, my_amorpm);
Mathworks requires a parallel toolbox for your client and another license for the parallel server workers. The number of workers you can call on the server is capped by the license, how many the company affords. workers run on real cores, they do not really use hyper threading. I usually start my parallel pool asking for 1024 workers and the server gives as many as are free. For a fair benchmark, how many cores will the user of your software have access? mathworks has great documentation just google "mathworks, question"
Thank you so much for the response! I attempted to do what you said, but now the error is saying that the 'AM' variable is still undefined. In the workspace, my\_amorpm has the value of 'AM' and i have changed every instance of the original amorpm variable with my\_amorpm. What you said about needing to define the variables makes sense to me, but I am now confused on why the variable is defined and still creating an error. Do you have any idea why this would happen?
 amorpm == AM; % This checks if the variable amorph is equal to the variable AM strcmp(amorpm,"AM"); % This checks if the variable amorph contains a string that is equal to the string "AM" amorpm = "AM"; % Warning! "==" doesn't work for strings! Use strcmp()! 
thanks for the help :) , it worked.

I will try iterating for longer t see if I end up with similar results and curves. Cheers!
Heun's method is all over the internet, the "mid point" method we learnt in lectures. It is achieved by choosing different constants int he derivation.
Ahh. I see. Seems silly to not just use RK4. that's pretty much the industry standard. 
Just use imresize for both downsampling and upsampling operations and make your life easy. Imresize already implements anti-aliasing, so you don’t have to explicitly low pass filter that way either.
Thank you so much for the help. I wasn't sure if # of workers == # or cpus or # of cores. Now I am sure that the program is running on 12 processes, each process is occupying 1 cpu with full utilization of cores. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
take a look at my responses here: &amp;#x200B; [https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/995ei0/sequential\_datagenerated\_gui\_elements\_in\_app/](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/995ei0/sequential_datagenerated_gui_elements_in_app/)
Thank you so much for your help!! 
 if (x &gt; my_integer) || (y &lt; my_value) "||" is "or". "&amp;&amp;" is "and". There are other ways to do it, google "matlab logical operators". 
Thanks but isn't this more of an "and" operator?
"||" is "or". "&amp;&amp;" is "and". If you don't trust me, google "matlab logical operators".
I just finished phone interview and online assessment. When will I get a response from MathWorks? I made a mistake and had no time to correct in the coding. Will you look into my code if it doesn't compile? Thank you!
Why don't you just inspect the matrices you are trying to multiply? 
&gt; I am guessing its because Im multyplying in this order? 2 x 1 * 2 x 2 so the dimensions dont match up. Maybe I dont understand how this process works fully, but I thought in order to solve the system I would have to eliminate L by multiplying both sides by L inverse. Yes and yes. [Matrix multiplication](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MatrixMultiplication.html) is not commutative. As you've written it, you're computing: `L*Lt*x*Linv = B*Linv`
Quick tip: just use “for” and see how many cpu core your function is using. Sometimes a worker can use multiple cores if the built-in function is implemented for multi-threading (e.g. matrix multiplication, filter, fft,...). So adding more workers actually hurts the overall performance as they complete with each other for cpu time.
Use conv and deconv. 
the "whos *variableName*" command is your friend in cases like this. 
why dont you create new figure window for the second plot load system figure(1) plot figure(2) plot i forgot the correct syntax for figure, try to look at the documentation
yeah imma delete this I had a TOTAL brainfart and realized it before reading your relpy. figure 1 figure 2 nomenclature was literally all i needed. thanks. 
 d=((A*R)^(1/3)); That isn’t a function? How is Csize “embedded”? Anyway, if what you are saying is right, you have to break out “d” analytically (by hand). Or you could just brute force it by trying a million values of “d” and see if any of them works.
I am not really sure if your equations are in correct order. Variables to solve d are constants already? Also, how is this a function without any I/O? Everything you need as variables are already in your script-like function. 
`Sf==Se` What do you think this line does? &gt;Csize=.869\*(d\^-.097); &gt; &gt;d=((A\*R)\^(1/3)); %ASME Looks like Csize is a function of d? 
There is no way this code runs. Guaranteed you're getting a variable not defined error. 
I think they should get back to you within a couple weeks but I suggest following up with your recruiter to get a better idea of what to expect and when. It’s been a long time since i interviewed so I’m not knowledgeable of the current process. I definitely suggest asking your recruiter these questions. 
Try clicking on the "Try it in MATLAB" button in the upper-right of the example page: https://www.mathworks.com/help/predmaint/examples/similarity-based-remaining-useful-life-estimation.html It should display a command that you can run to open up this example in MATLAB: &gt;&gt; openExample('predmaint/SimilarityBasedRULExample') In the most recent version of the example, it looks like the local function "helperLoadData" was renamed to "loadData". You can find the declaration for this function in the "Helper Functions" section at the bottom of the Live Script that opens up.
Do you know of any resources online that go over implementation of this kind of system? I can find content on theory, but nothing on implementation (also it doesn't help that I'm not familiar with Simulink). We are in a time crunch (as always) to figure this out for my senior design and being an Ocean Engineer my group members and myself are not too experienced in this sort of thing. 
Please show us the code you're using, otherwise we don't know what you're doing wrong. 
Just a guess, since you haven't shown us your code, but you probably need to read the documentation on the topic of indexing. 
 for i = 1:5 result = log(i^2); % calculate something x(i) = result; % save it in the i:th position in an array. (Note that the "result" variable is unnecessary and that the code might as well be "x(i)=log(i^2);") end disp(x(3)); % display the third value Something like that? 
I think the shape of x and y are causing the issue. In 2015b, if I do z = cross(x,y) dot(x,z) % Returns non-zero dot(x,z') % Returns zero But if I do z = cross(x',y') dot(x,z) % Returns zero dot(x,z') % Returns non-zero
What version of Matlab are you working in? The documentation says it was introduced in r2018b.
So, the `'` command in MATLAB is the complex conjugate and you can show `cross(x',y') == cross(x,y)'` However, if you do element-wise transpose (`.'`) then it still won't be perpendicular. 
Ah, yep. That would be it. I'm working on campus today, and they only have 2018a. Do you know what would have similar functionality that I could use?
Oh, I see. I've been using ' as the transpose operator for so long, I forgot it had other functions. If I change the shape of x and y, I still get the same problem. 
You may be right, but i tried to compare the filtered result with the resize result ..and found the max pixel value difference..it was above 70 which a bit high. + I would like to know ho to upsample if possible. Any help appreciated.
Did you use the nearest neighbor interpolation option in imresize? If you did, it's exactly equivalent to what you were doing, except the low pass filtering on the downsampling is different. I also don't see why having code numerically equivalent to what you are currently doing has any bearing on reproducing JPEG compression.
No i did not do the neighbor interpolation. I will look into it and see how to do it. The jpeg compression is a key part of our capstone project ( final year ) 
I think suptitle() works if you have the Bioinformatics toolbox
Please see our [rules for submitting homework questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/462uwe/submitting_homework_questions_read_this/). You have to be able to give us at least something. Can you do the math but don't know how to write it in MATLAB? Show us in math what you're wanting, etc. 
Google “spherical coordinates”. You can express the particle as two angles: azimuth and elevation. You could write a function that moves gives the new azimuth and elevation of the particle after an 1-mile random move, based on the old azimuth and elevation. This will require some non-trivial trigonometrics. When you have this function, you are basically done.
It is not a mater on how long or large the number is. The issue is that with a fixed number of bits, you can only represent a finite set of values. The error in your Cas is very small. It is related to the machine accuracy (32, 64, bits) In general the numbers are represented using power of 2 so from a decimal number, it is not that easy to figure out where and why the error comes from
thankyou very much i will try this !!! 
yh sorry i only read that after i submitted 
There’s no elegant way to do this. I usually use: isInteger = x==floor(x);
Csize is a function of d. I have tried the iterative loop, but I'm trying to see if there is another way to solve it, like fsolve
well the inputs are the constants, out put is d. the main issue is one of the inputs is based on d.
Sf takes the value of Se. yes Csize is a function of d, and I want to solve for d
clear Nf=2.5;Ma=63.9;Tm=73.1;Sy=38000;Sut=65000; Cl=1;Ct=1;Cr=1;Csurf=.84; Ktb=3.5;%bending Kta=2; %Torsion Kf=2.25;Ks=1.57; &amp;#x200B; for d=.25:.0001:.75 % syms d Csize=0.869\*(d\^(-.097)); Sedot=.5\*Sut; Se=Cl\*Ct\*Cr\*Csurf\*Csize\*Sedot; Sf=Se; A=32\*Nf/(pi()); B=(Kf\*Ma/Sf)\^2; C=3\*((Ks\*Tm/Sy)\^2)/4; R=sqrt(B+C); %Radical d2=(A\*R)\^(1/3); %ASME &amp;#x200B; if d == round(d2,3) solution = d2 end end
 mod(x,1) == 0
This won't work for negative numbers because `floor`
Likely, if you're doing a bunch of calculations and hoping to end up with an integer, you'll actually end up close to an integer, but maybe not exactly. So, what you want to do is define what's "close enough" (maybe 1E-7 or so?), call that `d` (or whatever) and then say if abs(x - round(x)) &lt; d % do stuff here end
You could just use two fprints. One to print the start text and the next will then print the B's.
== is a comparison operator. Why do you use it here an a single equal sign elsewhere? If you define d after Csize, how will you be able to evaluate that function to get a value for Csize? 
Oh if you're trying to do numerical equation solving you can use fzero. 
There are some subtleties in complexifying the cross-product, but the essence is that you **need to conjugate the output of `cross`**, precisely to preserve the orthogonality condition you describe. See for example this [discussion on stackexchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/129227/cross-product-in-complex-vector-spaces). It's definitional, not a bug, though I agree with you the Matlab documentation provides no useful information here, and since they autodetect conjugates in `dot` to perform the correct operation, they could have done the same for `cross` (I just looked quickly at the code, and they don't).
Right, I understand the math behind it, I'm more wondering if there is any reason they don't return the conjugate? Like, is there a use-case I'm not thinking of where you wouldn't want the conjugate? Because in the MATLAB documentation they say that the output will be perpendicular to the two input vectors, which it isn't. 
1. n represents the dimension of the matrix. Here you have a 3x3 matrix. 2. x = zeros(n,n) creates an nxn matrix filled with 0 in the variable x. 3. e = zeros(n,1) creates a column vector of zeros. e(i)=1 will set the i-th component of the vector e to 1, so you will basically obtain the canonical base vector e\_i . 4. X(:,i) represents the i-th column of the matrix X. The colon ":" is a "wildcard" in MATLAB, meaning "every index". So basically, you could translate this by "every element at the i-th column". 5. This algorithm uses the PLU factorization, so it finds matrices P, L and U such that A=PLU, L being a lower triangular matrix, U an upper triangular matrix and P a permutation matrix. 6. P\*e will permute the lines of the canonical vector e\_i 7. The backslash "\\" operator is a linear solver. The code " x = M\\b " is solving the linear system Mx=b.
The output of `cross` *is* perpendicular for real valued vectors, which is all they describe in the documentation, at least in my version. I guess they wanted to leave `cross` as general as possible in other cases, so people could make their own definitional choices for non-real spaces. I've never heard of a non-conjugated dot product, so it makes more sense to automatically include conjugation in `dot`; the cross product is a more ambiguous object.
This is it. One line for the text you want then the next one for the data. 
That's better
Thank you so much!
Thanks a bunch! I'm a noob at matlab but I got it going. &amp;#x200B;
Glad to hear it!
for n=1:N vec[n] = 1/n;
 isa(x,’integer’) or isinteger(x)
You are on the right track, but you need to index the column and the rows. `n = 5;` `b = zeros(n,n);` `for i = 1:n` `for j = 1:n` `b(i,j) = 1/(j+i-1);` `end` `end` &amp;#x200B;
wouldnt b(i,j) just create a matrix? I want it to be a vector I'm trying to sum `1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/n` for the first entry of the vector `1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + .. + 1/(n+1)` for the next vector entry and up until, `1/n + 1/(n+1) + 1/(n+2) + ... + 1/(2n-1)` for the final entry &amp;#x200B;
I under stand you now. Here is what you want to do. `n = 5;` `a = zeros(n,1);` `b = zeros(n,1);` `for i = 1:n` `for j = 1:n` `b(j) = 1/(j+i-1);` `end` `a(i) = sum(b(:));` `end`
I think i understand your code woould a(i) be the final column vector in this case?
Yes, **a**, would save as a column vector where each element is the sum of 1/(i+j-1) for all i and j up to n
running your code I get a column vector full of zeros. for `a`
Here's the modified code I'm using that has the changes I've made: Nx = 101; Ny = 101; mpx = ceil(Nx/2); mpy = ceil(Ny/2); Ni = 500; V = zeros(Nx,Ny); T = 1; %assumed boundary for V_0 = 1V B = 0; L = 0; R = 0; %Setting boundary potentials V(1,:) = L; %left V(Nx,:) = R; %right V(:,1) = B; %bottom V(:,Ny) = T; %top, since not specified, this boundary will have the potential v_0 = 1V charge_order = 10^-9; n = 0; Q = [0]*charge_order; X = 0.5*[0.1]; Y = 0.5*[0.05]; X = X+mpx; Y = Y+mpy; Rho = zeros(Nx,Ny); for k = 1:n Rho(X(k),Y(k)) = Q(k)/eps; end for l = 1:n % Repeat for all charges for z = 1:Ni % Number of iterations for i=2:Nx-1 for j=2:Ny-1 V(i,j)=0.25*(V(i+1,j)+V(i-1,j)+V(i,j+1)+V(i,j- 1)+Rho(i,j)); end end end end V = V'; E = gradient(V); E = -E; [Ex,Ey] =gradient(V); Ex = -Ex; Ey = -Ey; x_range = (1:Nx)-mpx; y_range = (1:Ny)-mpy; figure(1) contour_range_V = -130:1:130; contour(x_range,y_range,V,contour_range_V,'linewidth',3); axis([min(x_range) max(x_range) min(y_range) max(y_range)]); colorbar('location','eastoutside','fontsize',14); xlabel('x ','fontsize',14); ylabel('y ','fontsize',14); title('Electric Potential distribution, V in volts','fontsize',14); h1=gca; set(h1,'fontsize',14); fh1 = figure(1); set(fh1, 'color', 'white') figure(2) contour(x_range,y_range,E,'linewidth',0.5); hold on; quiver(x_range,y_range,Ex,Ey,4); axis([-10 10 -10 10]); title('Electric field Lines, E (x,y) in V/m','fontsize',14); colorbar('location','eastoutside','fontsize',14); xlabel('x-axis in meters','fontsize',14); ylabel('y-axis in meters','fontsize',14); h2=gca; set(h2,'fontsize',14); fh2 = figure(2); set(fh2, 'color', 'white') 
Are you positive you copied it correctly?
&gt;EDIT AGAIN: I think its working! Did you learn anything? If yes, please do a little recap in your post as an edit for all those with similar questions!
Will do here in a second, I really need to brush up on my forloop skills
You're off to a good start :) Pretty interesting challenge you had there.
Look in the documentation for the functions findgroups and splitapply. They can be combined to do what you want. Take some time to read the example in splitapply, it takes a little bit of effort to understand it.
You can use the hankel matrix to get it in one line: sum(1./hankel(1:n, n:(2*n-1)))
UNIQUE is the function your are looking for. Try something like this. I do not have Matlab here so you may have to adapt a little bit. Unique may work on matrix (so your problem could be solved in one line of code) , you have too check. Here is a version assuming that unique only works with vectors X=[] ; for i=1:size(M, 1) X=[X;unique(M(i, :)] ; end
The variable RF seems to be a structure. Have you looked at all the attributes of that variable?
All good answers already, but here's one more: `isAnInt = isequal(x, round(x));` I also want to echo /u/Weed_O_Whirler in suggesting you evaluate your number in the context of the computation that produced it. --- [Documentation for `isequal`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/isequal.html) [Documentation for `round`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/round.html?s_tid=doc_ta)
My application is antenna but the thing i need to do on matlab is mathematical and just create a function using g(theta) = a cos(k\*theta)
Hey, just a quick note that MATLAB's documentation is awesome! Check out [the entry for `zeros`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/zeros.html), for example. For one of your other questions, see how [indexing](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/learn_matlab/array-indexing.html?searchHighlight=indexing&amp;s_tid=doc_srchtitle) works in MATLAB. Understanding MATLAB fundamentals will help you understand programs written in the language. Best of luck in your course!
[Logical indexing](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/array-indexing.html#d120e1410) will work for this.
Hi, i did try this. But what i was getting is multiple vertical curves ranging from -180 to 180. (looked Like oscillation). **However, i want one single curve with cos 0 = 1 (The highest point in the centre).** &amp;#x200B; So this was how i defined it: &amp;#x200B; A = 3; k = 1/3; t = \[-180:1:179\]; G = A\*cos(k\*t); figure plot(t,G)
Actually you are getting a single curve. However I realised you have to convert degrees into radians. So G=A*cos(k*t*pi/180) should do the trick. 
You'll want to use the [`xlim` command](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/xlim.html) and friends (`ylim` and `zlim`). Alternatively, since there are already commands included in your code, you can modify the [`axis` command](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/axis.html) to re-set desired axis limits.
Oh man! BLESS YOU! seriously! thank you very much indeed. I did not think about the degrees and radians at all! I am still not getting the perfect curve that i want, but at least instead of multiple ones, i am getting one single curve after making those changes! A bit of tweaking will hopefully give me exactly what i want. thank you so much.
MATLAB exposes the same interface for multiple classes that implement different optical flow algorithms. So depending on how you create the object, you get different implementations all exposing the same function `estimateFlow`: - `opticalFlowFarneback`: Estimate optical flow using Farneback method - `opticalFlowHS: Estimate optical flow using Horn-Schunck method -` opticalFlowLK`: Estimate optical flow using Lucas-Kanade method - `opticalFlowLKDoG`: Estimate optical flow using Lucas-Kanade derivative of Gaussian method https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/motion-estimation.html 
The information that I want should be on `model`. But I'll look at that variable
What you want to do to the matrix is called shifting in Matlab parlance.
Those patterns don’t really make sense. Could you go more into detail on what patterns your trying to achieve for each array? 
I think u/linuxlib solved it for me, it's just shifting the array over one each time. Thank you though! 
That's what I needed, thank you!
I didn’t even know you were able to shift arrays. Huh, well learned something new. 
Sometimes it's just knowing where to look in the docs. Took me a couple of tries. I was thinking about bit patterns and tried `rotate` first. But then I thought "dummy, what did you *think* `rotate` would mean in MATRIX Lab?" So I just thought "well what else might be applicable?" Glad I could help. Honestly, I thought it would be harder.
You'd need a for-loop, inside calling [`circshift`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/circshift.html) and storing the results in a [cell-array](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/cell-arrays.html).
So are you asking this: Given x = 10 (arbitrary, but just for the sake of simplicity), find all pairs of even integers between 1 and x: 2 4 6 8 10 2,4; 2,6; 2,8; 2,10; 4,6; 4,8; 4,10; 6,8; 6,10 
What do you mean by “all possible pairs of even integers”? Pairs based on what?
Yea, that is example answer he provided of how he wants the pairs organized in a new variable. 
I dont think my prof is basing it on anything. I sounds like he just wants even numbers together in pairs in a different variable
Okay, there's two functions you want to look into here: mod, and nchoosek. Here's a brief breakdown of how to accomplish this: 1. Assign x (i.e. 10 in my example above.) 2. Make an array from 1:x. 3. Use mod to find which values in that array are even. Assign those values to a new array (you could do this using a for loop, but there's an easy one-line solution. look up vectorization to start understanding how to eliminate unnecessary loops.) 4. Use nchoosek to generate a matrix of pairs. 
Thank you! I'll let you know in a bit my results!
Ahh ok I think I see what you're saying. So in pseudo code: &amp;#x200B; `for first_digit = 1 to some_number` `for second_digit = 1 to some_number` `if first_digit is even and second_digit is even then` `Combine first_digit and second_digit` `Add combo to an array` `next second_digit` `next first_digit` `output array`
Sorry for the formatting. Idk why it didn’t leave my indents 🙄
indents are 4 spaces in front to force reddit to block it as 'code' formatting. for first_digit = 1 to some_number for second_digit = 1 to some_number if first_digit is even and second_digit is even then Combine first_digit and second_digit Add combo to an array next second_digit next first_digit output array
Ahh thank you!
Web application is enough to get a recruiter to call you if you have the background for the position. If you know someone you can ask them to put you in as a referral and you'll have a better chance of getting the first call. (I.e., I would phone screen a referral almost no matter what.) That person would net a bit of cash too if you got hired and made it to 6 months. 
Well that answers my question, so thanks! Now a new problem arises in that I need to alter the code somehow to make that top boundary at y = 0.05 1V. Since there is no boundary initially set for V_0, I have attempted to switch from top to bottom, left, and right, but the data doesn't show up. (I'm assuming that it's still where is was before I limited the axes.)
Write a solution on paper in pseudocode first. This way you avoid worrying about syntax while you work out what it should do. Then once you have the algorithm done, you can worry about syntax. 
When you say "nested for loops" are you allowed to nest an if statement in the for loop?
worth noting though, I think I transcribed it wrong because you'll miss the last digits the way I rewrote what you did.
I’m looking through Matlab’s Loops and Conditionals about how they work, and his lecture isn’t making much sense (the one he recorded and uploaded). For the first matrix, can I use a 5x5 of ones and replace columns 2 and 4 with 0’s?
I mean, you could even just have 1s in all of the columns unless your prof specifically said you needed 0s in the others. Your proposed solution is totally viable to me. g = ones(5,5); g(:,[2,4]) = 0; or do the reverse?
Huh, thanks man. I’ll try and figure out how to do it using if/then statements or loops maybe
What have you done so far?
So what I have done was go ahead and put in the given info and made them each a variable. I made V=7 etc. I then was going to set up the equation to find mechanical energy on matlab. I just wasn't sure if I was going in the right direction. 
Write how to solve it equation by equation in there
So I would input in the equation for mass flow rate and etc? So when I graph it how would I be able to graph the range of numbers? if that makes sense. 
Your prof said to do it using conditional or loops. I think you could just do something like this for conditional? g(1:5,1:5) = 1; g(:,[2,4]) = 0; For a loop, try something like gg(1:5,1:5) = 0 % Initiating matrix for i = 1:2:5 gg(:,i) = 1; end
Learning to read the documentation is extremely important. (I don't mean that in a demeaning way, I genuinely believe that doing so will give you a huge leg up over your peers) It'll take some time to learn how to find what you're looking for though. check out the example on this page, and see if you can adapt it for what you need. https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/plot.html
Dang, that’s perfect! So what’s happening in the code is that i is pulling out columns 1,3,5 because counting 1 to 5 by 2 gives you that, and then gg(:,i) is what actually gives us the actual columns in the code, and then they are turned to ones... Makes sense!
See: Nx = 101; Ny = 101; mpx = ceil(Nx/2); mpy = ceil(Ny/2); And: X = 0.5*[0.1]; Y = 0.5*[0.05]; X = X+mpx; Y = Y+mpy; And: x_range = (1:Nx)-mpx; y_range = (1:Ny)-mpy; It's something to do with those, from the looks of it.

The phone interview is mostly about your thought process and approach to problem solving. Don't be afraid to ask questions or state any assumptions that you make. There are normally 3 phone interviews (zero onsite) for the internship: HR, technical, and a short interview with a hiring manager to get a feel for your goals and interests. Here's a couple of recent threads on this topic: https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/af9wwn/mathwork_edg_internship/ https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/a17z42/anyone_interview_at_or_work_for_the_mathworks/ I'd be happy to answer any other questions that you have regarding the interview process or internship as a whole.
I don't see you calling `plot` anywhere in your code. If you type `help plot` into the command window, that should get you going.
No worries; I hope this helps you better understand. A lot of Matlab is just learning by doing.
So what I did in the beginning was plot all three of the data figure plot3(d\_array,v\_array, W\_eDotarray, '.b') xlabel('Blade Diameter (m)', 'interpreter','latex') ylabel('Velocity (m/s)', 'interpreter','latex') zlabel('$\\dot{W}\_e$(kW) ', 'interpreter','latex') But for some reason it would not show? &amp;#x200B;
I’m sorry whoever down-voted you cause that’s bullcrap
Did you plot before populating the arrays v_array and such or after the two for loops. If you plotted before, then nothing will show as the arrays are empty at that time. Try plotting after you populate those arrays.
Did you plot it before you calculate `d_array`, `v_array`, and `W_eDotarray`?
I learned in grad school because I decided to use MATLAB for my research, and the fantastic documentation. I definitely learned programming the wrong way because I am still picking up a lot of the formal CS foundations; I code in python now for research and a lot of things I've taken for granted in MATLAB don't translate very well to python, *particularly* mutable/immutable objects, and function pass by reference, variables actually being labels, etc .. If you're still in undergrad and you have time, I would recommend some actual CS 101 classes.
Ask questions and understand what the code means. Just copying the professor's code will not allow you to learn. Matlab is coding logic so if you understand how to think like a code you can implement. Matlab also has a great help feature that can guide you through almost everything as long as you understand the coding logic. 
Honestly, I think a great way to learn is just to pick a project you want to do and then google your way through it. A lot of what I’ve learned really just came because I’ve had assignments that contained various tasks I didn’t know how to do. You look up how to do a specific thing, learn about new functions, some clever ways to index vectors and matrices, and just tricks in general. You could just google things, but there’s so many things MATLAB can do you’ll just be overwhelmed and probably not retain much of it. If you pick a project though it’ll help you focus on specific things you might find useful, and over time you’ll be surprised at how much you’ve actually picked up. There’s no one trick or resource that’ll teach you everything you need to know, you’ll just have to keep pushing yourself and you’ll start figuring out how to do what you need. 
CS101 was awful imo, and steered me away from programming. We learned SCHEME which is basically LISP. It is a horrible, useless language. I learned MATLAB because I had a goal in mind and it was all I had available at the time. But I didn't realize how terrible my programming skills were until I learned Python. I agree with your sentiment here, but be careful which class you take.
Sounds like the best bet. I do have assignments to complete in matlab and they do help me learn a lot, but I find that some of it were discussed in class and I didn't pick it up. Sometimes I don't know what the prof is even talking about. Some of my friends had the same problem as me, so I guess it could be that we are just new and slowly absorbing the information. 
&gt; Matlab also has a great help feature that can guide you through almost everything as long as you understand the coding logic. Slowly getting the hang of it. The terminology however sometimes confuses me a bit, and the documentation feels a bit hard to understand. 
Yeah, I think assignments are great. It does depend on your professor, but usually it’ll be something relevant to what you’re studying and will be a reasonable difficulty (since it’s definitely easy to underestimate how difficult a project can be, especially if you’re not familiar with MATLAB). I remember when I first started really learning MATLAB. It was the same thing, my professor posted a bunch of notes with code and how to do things and all that. The notes were really good and everything, but just looking at someone else’s code isn’t going to really teach you how to use MATLAB on your own. But then we got to our final project, which was almost entirely in MATLAB, and the notes were a great reference. But it was figuring out how to piece together everything he’d written in the notes in order to do something different that really helped me learn my way around. I think you’ll find the same thing. You’re probably not gunna get a lot out of just staring at the notes, and you shouldn’t feel like you’re just doing it wrong if you don’t. But you can use the notes for help when actually doing your assignments, and doing all of that is what’ll help you get to know it. 
I know for instance opticalFlowLK does it use the pyramids or it uses only the frame as it is? , what I'm trying to say if it does it won't be necessary to compute flow in each level of the pyramid, and thanks for your response :) 
I believe this `opticalFlowLK` implementation doesn't use image pyramids (see the algorithm description in the docs): &gt; https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ref/opticalflowlk-class.html#buq1d3v-10_head Also if you compare it against `opticalFlowFarneback`, you notice that the Farneback method exposes options related to pyramids like 'NumPyramidLevels' and 'PyramidScale', but not the LK method. 
You can use ‘findpeaks’ to find the peak locations and then use curvefitting routines from there. You’ll probably need to try different window sizes around the peak to get the best result. https://uk.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/findpeaks.html What does the data look like? Can you post a sample image?
I have been using findpeaks to locate the peaks , but as you will see from the attached image, the peaks aren't all the same shape and consequently can't be fitted in curvefitting toolbox. Equally I have 556 different datasets (reaction over time) and therefore the curvefitting toolbox won't work. &amp;#x200B;
The best way to learn Matlab is to use it. Read/search the documentation when you don't know how to do something you're trying to do. Try stuff. The whole point (well one of the major benefits at least) to an interpreted language like Matlab is that you can try stuff in the console and see exactly what it does. Hold yourself to some standards in how you write code. You'll improve more by taking the time to figure out how to do something right than by slapping it together quickly. Think about what you want your code to do before writing code. Then write code that does what you want. Never program by guessing, writing random code and changing it until you get an answer that "looks right".
The issues you describe is why a lot of people think of Matlab as "programming with training wheels", which I think is fine since it's used in research and engineering where the goal is results not production quality software. That said, understanding those concepts is helpful in Matlab too. Variable names are labels in Matlab too, and you can create pass-by-reference objects. Really, once you learn 2 or 3 languages, you realize that they're all more or less the same, just with syntax differences and different standard libraries. 
Are all these 556 curves evolutions of the one in your image? If so you could stack them into a 2D array and use the coherence between them to extract the information you need. Also I wonder if wavelets are a good option for processing this data.
First of all I'd suggest viewing the documentation in the full size browser, not the shitty little pop up that appears by default the first time you hit f1. If the documentation is hard to understand you might need to read some of the sections on the basics of the language. It's very clearly written, the same words always mean the same thing, and everything means exactly what it says, as is typical in programming. If it's not clear to you, it's likely that you are simply missing some knowledge of the basics that you can remedy by reading the appropriate documentation sections. 
Yes, essentially the other 555 datasets looks very similar to this one with peaks dissapearing over time/datasets and new peaks forming. I have all of them in a matrix with the first column as X (wavenumber) and each y column with a dataset from 1-556, so I have a 3526 x 556 matrix (3526 as that is the number of wavenumber data points). &amp;#x200B; When you say use the coherence between them as a measure of difference between the data sets, is there a matlab function for that? I will look into wavelets, thank you for your help!
Do you have some physical model that dictates the peak shapes? Or are you just approximating them as Gaussian? Some important things to learn about fitting (peaks or any other function) are that: 1. If your fit function cannot model all aspects of the data, it's never going to give you a good fit. In your case the data seems to have a significant "shelf" that the peaks are sitting on top of. A simple Gaussian will never capture this. 2. If you want the fit parameters to have meaning, you must have both a good fit and a fit function that you have a priori expectation will describe the data. If you know ahead of time how many peaks you have, say N of them, you could construct a fit function that is the sum of N Gaussians, each with a different amplitude, position, and width. You could add a few extra parameters like a linear slope and offset to capture the "shelf". If you don't know how many peaks to expect, it's more difficult to do this via fitting. Without taking any extraordinary steps, I'd say the best bet is just to use findpeaks() or similar to give you peak locations. If you really do need a fitted model, you could then use the output of findpeaks to determine how many Gaussians to use in the approach I described previously, but you'd need to write code to model an arbitrary number of peaks rather than a fixed number. This is pretty straightforward really, but not quite as easy as a predefined number of peaks. 
If you have them in an array called `data' use use: images(data) This will plot the contents of the array as an image.
I send you a pm
I never used the map plotting, i'm quite sure it'll work like all other matlab using graphics handles. When you use plot, you can update the XData and Ydata properties to speed up plotting as explained [here](https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/332188-how-to-speed-up-live-plotting-over-time). I bet there are similair properties in your map tool to achieve the speedup you want.
Thanks, ill give it a go.
Scheme/Lisp is incredible for learning foundational concepts of computer science and programming, though. Recursion, dynamic programming, trees, stacks, the list goes on. Proper mastery of a low-level language like Scheme makes things like MATLAB and Python a total breeze.
I guess I missed that point, I just wanted to learn something more applicable to the real world.
I like using both help and doc. The info seems to be complementary in a way.
Agreed. As a matrix language MATLAB is unsurpassed, and the developers made a lot of smart decisions that make that intuitive, such as arrays being first class citizens, and things like lazy copy on write, whereas python nothing is copied unless you tell it. Since objects are (I think?) first class citizens in python, numpy is much clunkier, although I do think dot notation is very elegant, i.e. a.max()
Another try perhaps is to make use of the 'drawnow' command. I've used it to animate plots on maps and was quite satisfied with the outcome
Thank you for this, I have tried it and it hasn't clarified anything. But will keep it in mind for future analysis.
I am using the fit('gauss') model to specific data sets, which is laborious and what I suspect is wrong. I know there are 12 peaks to monitor (can see by eye) however the positions of these peaks changes over the reaction and therefore peak locations will be able to tell me where they are, I agree. The spectrum has already been background and baseline corrected, suggesting this shelf is illustrating spectral overlap (a.k.a overtone vibrations). I can't get rid of it as I'd be removing spectral information. I am assuming they will fit Gaussian peaks (by eye), so are you suggesting I write an model that uses fitpeak to find the peaks throughout the dataset: `for j = 1:size(signal_y,2);[pks,locs,widths,proms]=findpeaks(signal_y(:,j),signal_x,'MinPeakProminence',0.0002,'Annotate','extents');` `end` Something like this? Assuming signal\_y is a matrix full of eat data set as a column and signal\_x is my wavenumber data? Thanks for the help! &amp;#x200B;
Can't even refractor a for loop but she knows things 😅🙄
If the apparent shelf truly is due to the overlap of the various spectral peaks, then a fit to a multiple Gaussian function should work fine. I don't think fit('Gauss') will work though, since that only fits a single peak and therefore won't describe the overlap. You could write your own function representing 12 Gaussians, and fit it to the data with something like lsqcurvefit. Findpeaks() would be a good way to make an initial guess at the peak locations for the fit. 
Use it
You can actually manually edit the .slx file to point to the correct version. Assuming you didn't use any blocks that were new to r2018b, this should work just fine. https://stackoverflow.com/a/53540972/6242347
How do you expect us to help without posting the (relevant part of) code? What starting points are you providing your fit? What are the output of the fit for a good fit vs one that fails? Have you e.g. tried to increase max number of iterations? Or provide better starting guesses?
With nine points you don't have enough information in the data to render something nice. There is no way to create new information. You may interpolate but that is just a poor workaroud. The only solution I see would be to take into account for some additional external information such as geometric description of the patches around the measurement point. Thus would allow genzrate much better points than a spline or a linear interp..but I do not have a clue how you could get these info... 
Just added the code, hope that helps. But it is not so much about the fit, because that works perfectly, it's more about the graphs not showing up. &amp;#x200B; As to your questions. I have biological data of size, so I am starting at the smallest value going to the biggest. And each iteration is one cell. So I cannot really increase the iterations, because I only have data for 30 cells. I tried minimizing, only doing the first 10 or so, but even then I had a couple of graphs not complete. 
Are there NaN’s in your data?
You can convert points to a surface via [Delaunay triangulation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/delaunay.html). 
Thank you! I was actually just looking into this. The only examples I can find are with random points. Do you know of good example code with user defined points?
I'm not certain what you're looking to do.. Maybe just plot the points with `scatter3` or `stem3`? Or are you trying to interpolate irregularly sampled points? i.e `scatteredInterpolant` then create a regular grid with `meshgrid` and plot the surface with `surf` or `mesh`. See here for examples: &gt; https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/visualize/representing-a-matrix-as-a-surface.html 
No, everything has a datapoint. No zeros or anything either. 
I didn't mean the iterations over spinearea, but the iterations of the fit for each cell. Try to take a look at the documentation for fit, and maybe increase the "MaxIter". Also look at the starting point for the fits. It might be that Matlab chooses random starting points and therefore it the fit might not converge if the the starting point is too far from the solution. If you give the fits a fixed starting point I'm guessing you would at least see the same fits fail. 
Thank you, I agree I'm not sure how I would collect that data. It doesn't have to be pretty, but as someone else mentioned, could I use Delaunay Triangulation? and maybe increase the number of trianles ( if that is possible) to smooth the surface a bit more.
scatter3 does work, however I end up with scattered points in 3D space. I would like to connect those points with planes to create a surface.
you can use `patch` and pass the vertices and faces you define. 
In combination with scatter3/stem3? or scatteredInterpolant?
no that's different, please review the doc links I posted.
will do, thank you
If you indent the code by four spaces it will be formatted as code. Also, what is the error you are getting?
You could consider using a laser range finder of some sort to measure height. Make a rig where the laser points downwards some distance from where the rig is standing. Then you can use that to measure the relative height distance between where the rig is standing and where the laser is pointing. And then use that to move across the floor in steps. Maybe you would need to somehow measure some points coming from multiple directions as the errors might stack up. What kind of "unlevelness" of the floor are you expecting? cm? or mm?
Thank you, I actually used a similar method to collect the points I have. Just didn’t have that much time at the location and it’s cluttered. Unfortunately I’m looking at differences by inches. I’m doing this to estimate a cost for floor leveling. 
thanks for the reply, here's the error: "not enough input arguments error in mean (line 67) [flag, omitnan] = parseInputs(flag, flag2, inflag2set)"
I think I might know the problem: you probably want `boxplot(ests(:,1),`, not `bobxplot(mean,`, since `mean` is a function not a variable name. Similarly, you probably want `boxplot(ests(:,2),` instead of `boxplot(std,` and `boxplot(ests(i,3),` instead of `boxplot(Q75,`.
Thank you, I actually used a similar method to collect the points I have. Just didn’t have that much time at the location and it’s cluttered. Unfortunately I’m looking at differences by inches. I’m doing this to estimate a cost for floor leveling. 
thanks for the reply, here's the error: not enough input arguments error in mean (line 67) [flag, omitnan] = parseInputs(flag, flag2, inflag2set)
thanks, that partially worked hahahaha i got 2 subplots and then this error: error using subplot (line 326) index exceeds subplot limit
That is because you are trying to use the third subplot when you only defined two subplots. You need to have `subplot(1,3,` rather than `subplot(1,2` everywhere.
I'm not sure what you're asking, but I think you want to type `hold on` so plots don't overwrite each other. 
it worked! thanks a lot
I'll explain better! I'm bad at this. &amp;#x200B; I have one matrix that has the values 20, 1, 0 with 0 being an interior point, 1 being an exterior point, and then 20 being a nonessential point, I call it boundaryr. &amp;#x200B; I have another matrix that represents the probability that the deer will be in a particular square over time, I call it sol\_final. &amp;#x200B; Whenever I've tried hold on it will completely obliberate the sol\_final values and I think it's due to the fact that the value differences are so large within my graph. 
There are two aspects being discussed. One is how to learn or why to learn. For how, lots of good suggestions already. I would say pick a project and use documentation to learn language. Other thing being discussed here is CS101. Well, that is important if someone is going to spend a lot of time programming. In my opinion however, Python or MATLAB are not right languages for learning those things (other than if you don’t have need to use other languages). For learning the concepts in detail, I would start with C for functional paradigm and C++ for object oriented. Once you know how to program in those languages, other languages become easy. However, to truly become expert in a language you simply need to put in time, deal with fact that some things would be different and try to implement the good design patterns. Also wanted to say here MATLAB can be used for production code (too general a term) in different ways either using MATLAB Compiler or coder products and I am not even talking about Simulink. 
If you plan on programming in the real world, understanding those fundamental concepts is critical. The idea that they're irrelevant to practical applications is very wrong. 
any idea what this part of the question means: "and calculate suitable numerical summaries."
Thank you, I will look into it, and hopefully it’ll help. :) As for the starting points, that is a good argument, because Matlab is warning me that it chooses random points, because I haven’t fixed them, but it hasn’t occurred to me, since it wasn’t a “real” error, that I might need to change something there. 
No, that would depend on the teacher.
okay
Yep, understanding side effects in general would be a huge boon to a lot of bootcamp type programmers.
That's just learning how to program. It sucks, but the only way to really learn it, in whatever langauge, is to bang your head on it for hours until you can see whats going on. The problem is no one can do it for you, and there really isn't a shortcut. I can't train you to see the subtle syntax errors you are writing, or really guide you through understanding why your stuff doesn't work. We've all been there. This fucking code looks right, why doesn't it work. I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY THE FUCKING COMPILER IS GIVING ME A SYNTAX ERROR!?! It's just par for the course man. My suggestion, as others have already said. Do yourself a favor and take a legitimate CS sequence. It should be roughly a year in length, if not a bit longer. It shouldn't be easy, because whats the point. A strong course will allow you to pick whatever language you think will solve the problem at hand well and quickly become proficient. Steer clear of the bootcamp stuff. It's alright if you just need to write some excel macros or whatever, but a profressional who would use something like MATLAB can and will benefit greatly from a legitimate course. They do EE's a diservice by telling you that you only need one MATLAB course and maybe a C/Assembly micro course. It's just not true. No EE grad that is actually useful in any capacity in industry is getting away with having no programming skills.
&gt; "programming with training wheels" I can't see how someone would think that. They try to make it accesible, but it's just as fully featured of a language as Python. Frankly some of their design approaches at this point are superior to Python because they aren't as hampered by a design committee. 
&gt; C++ for object oriented Except C++ is a shit show compared to modern languages. Their approach to generics is just so ass. Not that I don't use it all the time or anything xD.
You can also just adjust the axis by using the command: axis([xmin xmax ymin ymax]) 
Hahaha!! To master you must go through the shit 😆. I hated it all the time I was working in it. But I think I value it more when I am working with other languages. But I won’t go back unless I really need to xD
Thank you so much, I just added StartPoint and now all graphs show everything, and it works perfectly fine! Thank you again, I would have probably spent a lot more unnecessary time on this. :) 
good to hear, that you fixed it!
well, I'd guess that inches should be resolvable with a laser range finder.
The floor is fairly cluttered so it’s tough. But it’s something I’ll consider. 
It's just a thought off the top of my head. There are probably better solutions
I don't think that plotting two `pcolor` plots on top of each other is going to give a good result. However, if you really want to do this, you can change the transparency of the top plot like so: figure ; pcolor(X,Y,DATA); hold on ; h = pcolor(X,Y,DATA2); set(h,'facealapha',0.5); The `facealpha` property controls the transparency, where a value of 1 is completely opaque, and 0 is completely transparent. Using commands like above will make the top plot somewhat transparent. I hope this helps. 
I don't understand why having user defined data or random data would matter? The inputs are just vectors, the source of those vectors is immaterial. 
Thanks for your answering, can you send me the email, so I can send the attachment file for you. Thanh Binh.
Thanks for your link, I have taken it a try, but it doesn't help.
That typically means mean, standard deviation, and the 5# summary (min, Q1, median, Q3, max) but might also depend on what your teacher may have said about what they expect.
You want to find the normal using only your z1 and z2 functions, without taking advantage of your knowledge of the equation coefficients? Well, think about how you would do that by hand. What defines a normal vector to a plane? If you had two vectors parallel to the plane (but not each other) could you calculate a normal from that? How might you obtain two such vectors? 
&gt; data = [4dunit1, 4dunit2, 4dunit3] Are you sure of the shape of your data? This will concatenate horizontally. Is that what you want? What is size(4dunit1) and size(data)? &gt; for i = 1:5 &gt; for i = 1:3 You're using i as the loop index for both the inner and outer loop. What do you expect this to do? Also, in Matlab i = j = sqrt(-1) so it's bad practice to use them as variables. &gt; d = data(i); So d is a scalar, equal to the i-th element of data. &gt; myextract = d(:,:,1,i); Yeah this is going to error. size(d) is [1 1] so indexing the fourth dimension is going to fail. &gt; end;
say `x1` is your large matrix of 0's and 1's: x1 = double(rand(5) &gt; 0.7); first we find the indices of the non-zero columns: indices = find(sum(x) ~= 0); next we pick a random one: ind = indices(randi(numel(indices), 1)); now you can extract said column: col = x1(:,ind); 
Sorry I meant to swap the two for loops. The first loop is for each camera and the second loop is for each frame. After triggering, I use getdata(vidobj, vidobj.FramesAvailable) to store in data1 and then the same for each of the cameras (data2, data3). Those frames are in 4Duint8. What I'm trying to figure out is how to loop over these matrices (data1, data2 and data3) so that I can extract out each frame. 
It doesn't really matter what order you have them in, you're still using the same variable to index both loops. I'm surprised that even runs. I'm also unclear how you're getting 4D data out of the process you describe. 3D, maybe. I have never heard of a 4duint8 data type. 
Idk that is the data type it shows me in ny workspace. I dont want to loop over the row or column of the individual data type, I want to loop over the data type itself. I'm coming from python so I normally just put each variable in a list and then loop over the list. List1 = [obj1, obj2, obj3]
[a, b, c] is array concatenation in Matlab. 
Each frame is a 3D array--height, width, color channel. And you can store multiple frames in a 4th dimension. That is why its 4D
what is the name of the variable stored in the mat-files? i.e what is the output of this: whos -file 'r 75 p.mat' then you can plug this variable name in the code below, i.e replace `xxx` below with the var name): for ... % loop over params fname = sprintf('%s %d %s.mat', r, i, p); S = load(fname); m = mean(S.xxx); end (I'm assuming all mat-files use the same variable name) notice how `load` returns a structure. 
Aah, I wasn't thinking of color information. That makes sense. He'll still need to concatenate along the 4th subscript though. 
What he pointed out was probably your usage of the same variable name for both loops. You use i =1:x and again i = 1:y. Basically the inner loop replaces the value of the outer one 
Ah ok. That was a typo
&gt; data = [4dunit1, 4dunit2, 4dunit3] I think you mean to use cell arrays instead, i.e: data = {4dunit1, 4dunit2, 4dunit3} which is then indexed as: d = data{i} 
+ extremely helpful- thank you so much! pushes me over a major hump in my project.
OK, so a few things I am noticing about your code: &amp;#x200B; 1) you use the variable r\_or\_t at several points (in sprintf and if statements), but that variable does not appear to be defined. &amp;#x200B; 2) It assumes the names of your files. This will crash any time you try to open a file that does not exist. May be fine for your purposes now, but this is not good practice in general. I would suggest generating a list of your file names with the dir() command, i.e.: files = dir('\*.mat'); %get all .mat files in current working directory for i = 1:length(files) data = load(files(i).name); I suspect if you get fancy with your filename definitions in the dir() function, you can automatically sort your files. &amp;#x200B; 3) Once you have generated a list of filenames with the dir() command, you can use strsplit() to break filenames into their respective parts. You can use you file name components to sort your data into appropriate arrays. &amp;#x200B; 4) With that in mind, any time you know you are going to get a string that is one of a few different types, switch-case statements are probably your best practice. You could use a bunch of if-else statements with strcmp(), but switch-case will handle most of that for you. The == statement you use here will only work well for single character comparisons. If you use it on a string, it does a character by character comparison and returns a logical array. Not saying this doesn't work for your specific purpose, but it is generally bad practice. &amp;#x200B; 5) I know MATLAB probably warns you to pre-allocate your arrays for speed, but I seriously doubt your arrays are getting large enough for that to make a difference, and the way you are writing things now your arrays are much larger than necessary. &amp;#x200B; 6) It seems like your loop indexing variable will sweep over all of your angles of incedence, but that you will not get all angles for all measurements (i.e. you wont get transmitted, reflected, and polarization data at all angles). Using the dir() command and looping over files as suggested above should help with that. 
I can't tell you the amount of times I wanted to change something in a visual representation (figures, GUIs) and found the answer "nope, not possible, you have to change the underlying java code". Just a quick example, I wanted to get any sort of handle when I click on the very top of a figure, the part that let's you move the whole window around. It's not possible. It's mind blowing. Or let's say I want to change the ResizeFcn of a window such that it does not refresh every milisecond I resize a window (because it causes ugly flickering). Also not possible unless you do some very clunky tic toc pauses. If you want to make a nice visual for you clients with matlab then may god help you.
So your first plane is 3x+4y-5z=0 If you compute the gradient of the plane you will get the vector that is perpendicular. v1 = [dP/dx ; dP/dy ; dP/dz] = [3,4,-5] The gradient of the second plane is the same. With that vector you need to normalize it. v1norm = v1/norm(v1) Since the planes are parallel you can pick any point (x,y,z) that passes through the first plane call it point A1. Then you need to compute a line that passes through both planes that moves along v1norm where A2 passes through plane 2. A2 = A1 + d*v1norm. In this case A1 is a known coordinate and v1norm is a known vector. To solve for d you simply dot the entire equation with v1. This will give. v1^T A2 = v1^T A1 + d*v1^T v1norm Because A1 and A2 lie in their respective planes you get the following equation. 20 = 0 + d * v1^T v1norm. Then just use that equation to find d. 
&gt; Try stuff. The whole point (well one of the major benefits at least) to an interpreted language like Matlab is that you can try stuff in the console and see exactly what it does. This is the main thing that will help you. If you have code from your teacher, run the code one line at a time and see what happens to the variables. You can peek at their sizes in the workspace window, or the actual values in the variable editor, or just see what's inside on the command line (just type the variable name and hit enter, or use the size function). This has helped me catch so many instances where I've missed the fact that one of my vectors got assigned as a row and the other is a column so I can't add/subtract/etc. them until I transpose one. Also learn how to use the debugging tools if you haven't yet! They can help you step through a program line by line, or automatically stop inside a function at the line where you're getting an error ("dbstop if error" and "dbclear if error" are super useful commands to know), so you can see what the variables look like at that point and figure out why your code doesn't work, and test your fixes. I definitely agree about planning out the logic of your code before you actually write it (see pseudocode if you're not familiar with the idea). Especially for long scripts/functions/projects with many steps. Think about the format you want your data to be in at the end so that it's accessible, and work backwards from there to figure out how to make that happen. But sometimes functions do not do what it seems like they logically should do, especially with regards to the format of outputs (see: my love-hate relationship with cellfun when I was learning). So don't get discouraged if you have to keep changing code to see if it works - as long as your problem is syntax and not logic, sometimes you do just have to say, fuck it, let me try curly brackets even though I swear I should already be inside this cell. The important part of doing this is that when it does work, you then go dig into the code and figure out why you have a cell inside your cell in the first place.
First, you have two ‘hold on’ statements. Only one is necessary. Take out the first one. I would also try plotting all the lines in one command instead of two. So you’d have: plot(t,v, t,x) instead of 2 separate plot commands. That should probably fix your legend issues. Hope that helps!
your loop isn't actually doing anything here, you could simply have the following: x = zeros(5,5) x(:,5) = 1:5;
Seems like you figured it out, but as feedback for your homework question. 1) You do not need loops to do this, 2) If the homework explicitly asked to use for loops, then yes you have done it, but there is a solution that only uses one loop. Hint: You technically have only one loop here even though you have two for loops
Use broadcasting for low rank matrices x = [1:5]'*[0 0 0 0 1]
But i Guess this would need a second loop to cover the case og transmission and s polarization (r is t instead, and p is s)? Is there not a smarter way to do it?
So if i understand correctly: using dir will find all files in current directory og type .mat and store them in the variable files. You then ude strsplit to break filename strings into its three components (as variables?) , And use (nested?) switch statements to cover the different cases? Im not very proficient with switch statements, could you point me in the right direction? Thanks for your help

Thank you for this,with my very basic knowledge of matlab I'm not sure how I'd do this, but I will read up on modelling Gaussians. I am monitoring a chemical reaction over time , so the features seen are vibrational modes. Thank you for your help again!
That mess of code is pretty much unreadable. If you post code, please indent it with four spaces like this As for your question, my first guess is that y1 and y2 are matrices, not vectors, probably because you did elementwise multiplication or division of a row vector and a column vector somewhere in your code.
Start with the documentation for lsqcurvefit. Most of the work will be in writing the model function, which should just take a vector of x axis values and a vector of parameters that define the peaks. The parameter vector could be, for instance, a length 3*n vector that contains [amplitude width location] repeated n times for n Gaussians. You'll end up providing that function and your measured spectrum to lsqcurvefit along with a reasonable initial guess at the parameter vector. Sometimes it helps understand what's happening if you have your model function plot the spectrum it's generating. This is inefficient but good for debugging. You'll be able to see what's happening at each iteration. 
I don't entirely understand your assignment, but often you can use a while or for loop to solve the same problem. I'm not really clear on what you're asking for though. Nobody is going to give you the answer. It's good that you've shown us your attempt so far, but why don't you tell us what you are not understanding? 
Sounds like you mean the midpoint algorithm https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midpoint_circle_algorithm
It looks like you're overwriting your Force variable in the while loop. You need to store in a vector, like you are with the diameter, so you dont just have one point to plot your diameter values against.
Obviously my answer was more of a pseudo-code, that's because you never defined the actual variables `r_or_t`, `i`, and `polarizationType`.. To sweep over these three parameters, either write nested loops one for each param, or you could do something like this to collapse them all as one for-loop: % assuming these are the possible values for each params r_vals = {'r', 'g', 'b'}; % reflected light i_vals = [75, 150]; % 75 degrees incident angle p_vals = {'p', 'n'}; % polarization % create all possible combinations stored as rows of cell array [r,i,p] = ndgrid(r_vals, i_vals, p_vals); params = [r(:) num2cell(i(:)) p(:)]; % loop over params for i=1:size(params,1) fname = sprintf('%s %d %s.mat', params{i,:}); % ... end 
Should we support Scilab a Free Alternative to MATLAB.?
Done
This can be done, but it will require a bit of effort. The [problem sounds like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-locked_loop#Jitter_and_noise_reduction) one for a phase-locked loop circuit. Such a circuit strives to keep a target signal synced with a known static signal. Thus the known tone of video stream would be used to correct the errors in the audio stream from the difference in the two signals, which are supposed to be at the same frequency. I am not aware of Matlab having such a function built into it, but [they have a guide](https://www.mathworks.com/help/comm/ug/synchronization.html). However, there are likely other ways to approach this based on your accuracy needs and also how badly out of sync the two signals can become over the course of a recording. You could possibly keep track of the two tracking signals by using an offset vector that notes the total offset of the audio signal. This could then be used to approximate a re-sampling pattern of the audio signal to match the video signal. This approach would likely not be able to operate in real time since it would effectively need to see into the future to know what sample to produce for the upcoming segment if the audio slows down too much. This is an interesting question.
Thanks. To be clear - we're dealing strictly with audio here, no picture, and the input wouldn't be a realtime stream rather a multi-track WAV (one track with reference tone, one with audio) or two WAV files. The idea would be to figure out how off from the nominal 60Hz sine wave the 60-ish Hz recorded reference tone is, align it with a perfect 60Hz and either simultaneously apply the same adjustment to speed to the audio, or generate a map of the speed changes that could be applied to the audio file in a second pass. 
You are spot on so far. Now that I think about it though, since you only have two 'cases' with a value in your file name, you can probably use strcmp with four if/elseif statements to avoid nested switch-case statements. As for strsplit, it will give you a cell array containing each of the string fragments it recovered after splitting based on your specific case. Your code would look something like this: &amp;#x200B; `splitvals = strsplit(files(i).name);` `if strcmp(splitvals{1},r_to_t value1) &amp;&amp; strcmp(splitvals{3},polarizationType1)` `- put data in appropriate array` `elseif strcmp(splitvals{1},r_to_t value2) &amp;&amp; strcmp(splitvals{3},polarizationType1)` `- put data in appropriate array` `...` `end`
Why don't you just ask your question here, so you can get dozens of people helping you instead of one?
If you're just looking to insert a line break in the output, use the '\n' character; if you're looking to break up the line in your code use '...' at the end of the line and then continue on the next line. Otherwise, I'm a bit confused by your question-- what do you want your output to look like?
Edited
What dorylinus said. Every time you need a like break in a print statement, input, or basically anything you’re putting in the command window you can use \n to do that. 
Instead of using input, you could use prompt and specify the text using fprintf. However, the input function should recognize \n as well.
The other answers here are telling you how to *print* a string over two lines. I think you're looking to split code over two lines to clean up your code. There are two answers here. To provide line continuation between each argument of a function, or element of an array, you use ..., like this: function(A,... B, C) Or A = [x,... y,... z] To split a single string across multiple lines, you actually use the second example I gave, to use array concatenation on the strings (actually, char arrays): function(['this is a very long ',... 'string argument to a function.' ]) 
A couple of things which might help: 1.) You don't have to check all the way to `x-1` since if a number is prime is must have at least one divisor less than or equal to the square root of that number 2.) You keep writing over `res` so `res` will be false unless `x-1` is a divisor of `x` (which of course it isn't) What you want to do is find a way to break out of your check the first time you find a `true` value. You might benefit from using a `while` loop, or looking at `break`. 3.) You are implementing the most basic of all prime number tests, but you [can read about better ones here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primality_test). 
Alright, step one is to determine what makes a number prime. Prime numbers are only divisible by themselves and one. So if a number is divisible by something else then it is not prime. Do you need to check all the numbers from 1 to x-1? What happens when you find the value of rem(8,2)? Do you need to check rem(8,4)? What does that information tell you about where the search should start and how/when the search should end?
Let's answer this question: What is a prime number? A prime number is a few things: 1) an integer 2) &gt;1 3) only divisible by 1 and itself So how do we implement this programmatically? 1) if floor(x) == x 2) if x&gt;1 3) This is the part you're primarily concerned with. Here's what we want to do: - Create a for loop from 2 to x. We do not care if x is divisible by 1 or by itself. - As you iterate through the loop, check to see if x is divisible by your loop variable (ii, jj, kk , whatever you want to name it.) This can be done using the rem function. If so, throw a "1" or a "true" into a vector. If not, add a 0 to the end of that vector. - Once you're out of the loop, check to see if all of your vector elements are equal to 1 and that x is a positive integer. If so, x is prime. Otherwise, it isn't. This is not the most efficient way to do this, or even necessarily the most logical, but it does work. 
This was very helpful, thank you so much!
Thank you!
Perfect, thank you!
thanks :) the \\n worked for what I needed, next I'll try the ... in the code to see if that'll make it look nicer.
Thanks a lot!
Think about it this way. Let's say I want to check if a number is divisible by 16. I could check if its divisible by 16...or I could check if it's divisible by 8 and 2, since 16 is also divisible by 8 and 2. Imagine then, writing out the prime factorization tree of 16. You'd get 2*2*2*2. Every composite number (e.g. every non-prime) can be written as the product of prime numbers. That means that, if you want to check if a number is prime, you could just check whether it's divisible by only the primes preceding it. So if I wanted to check if 27 was prime, all I would need to check is: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23. There are a lot of other ways you can check for prime number status, but this is a good way to get started.
Please read [our rules for submitting homework questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/462uwe/submitting_homework_questions_read_this/). 
Just put i in the loop. 
in what loop I already have i in the loop?
Not quite sure what this does, but when I run it, I get this output: clear xnew; iterlimit = 2; n = 4; A = rand(n,n); x = rand(n,1); b = rand(n,1); for iteration = 1 : iterlimit for i = 1 : n sum = 0; for j=1:n if j ~= i sum = sum + A(i,j)*x(j); end end xnew(i) = (-1)/A(i,i)*(sum-b(i)); disp(xnew) end end x = xnew; xnew &gt;&gt; loops 0.4812 0.4812 0.7649 0.4812 0.7649 0.4637 0.4812 0.7649 0.4637 -0.2289 0.4812 0.7649 0.4637 -0.2289 0.4812 0.7649 0.4637 -0.2289 0.4812 0.7649 0.4637 -0.2289 0.4812 0.7649 0.4637 -0.2289 xnew = 0.4812 0.7649 0.4637 -0.2289 &gt;&gt; 
Oh I think I misunderstood the problem. You just want to see each xnew? Just get rid of semicolon on xnew(i) line 
It's the jacobi iterative method, I want to see each individual xnew vector as it approximates it iteratively.
okay, so that isn't printing the final xnew over and over again? I was looking up other ways to do it and people were trying to store each vector in a table.
How did you manage to print the individual vectors produced by each step?
&gt;`sum = 0;` &gt;`if j ~= i` This hurts my brain. In Matlab, i = j = sqrt(-1), and `sum` is a built in function which you've redefined as a variable. 
It just did. I'm curious what your variable values are. I defined what you had as variables ambiguously. Also, do not use "sum" as a variable name. The other comment is correct.
Can you describe what distance you want to compute? 
I provided an image of the code. It’s just the standard distance formula between two points. 
It's actually not clear to me that you have interpreted the instructions for your assignment correctly, which is why I think you might want to reconsider what it is asking of you. 
Write a MATLAB function that will: 1. Take in a matrix that contains x-y data pairs. The first column contains the x-values, that is the horizontal distance from the origin; the second column contains the y-values, the vertical distance from the origin. Your function should work for a matrix with any number of rows. 2. Calculate and return a vector of the straight line distance for each x-y pair from the origin that uses a for loop. Those are the instructions word for word. 
So the assignment is to find the distance of each (x, y) point from the origin. Is that what you're doing in the code? Think about what the distance equation in your code is actually computing.
The algorithm you've written computes the distance between two consecutive (x, y) pairs as determined by their index. It is not computing the distance from one pair to the origin. There is nothing wrong with your coding, although it is inefficient, but rather your algorithm is off.
This sounds like it might be an [XY problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem). What, exactly, is it that you are trying to accomplish?
so you have an image that has dimensions of height x width x 3 (RGB) you can make a logical index for each layer - for example, for an image IMG, you can create a mask for red using the following: IMG(:,:,1) &gt; 200. This will return a height x width x 1 logical index, with values of 1 (true) if the R value is greater than 200, and 0 (false) if the R value is below the threshold. Anyways you do this 3 times and get 3 logical masks. Then you can combine them to have the same dimensions of the image using the cat() function: mask = cat(3,maskR,maskG,maskB) Once you have this mask, you can apply it to the image by converting the logical mask to an array and doing element-wise multiplication as follows: IMG .\* double(mask), then check if it worked using imshow().
Nothing looks obviously wrong in your code, but I'm not qualified to say whether you are implementing the correct equations. Have you tried basic debugging techniques? Construct an artificial input data set with a known curvature, and see what your code does with it. Maybe put a breakpoint in surfature.m and check each calculation step along the way. Maybe make a small surface (say, 3x3 or 4x4) so you can hand calculate the correct value at each step and compare to your code. 
A quick Google search led me here: https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/ug/algebraic-loops.html Does the section under the heading "Use The Algebraic Loop Diagnostic" help at all? Have you tried that yet? 
This is pretty straightforward in SQL but I don't remember the syntax. It's not a Matlab question though. I assume /r/sql exists? 
It wont work in sql i want to do the same thing sql would do but in matlab
Oh. You could do this with `ismember()` or `intersect()` and logical indexing. Read the documentation on logical indexing and those functions and you should be able to figure it out pretty easily. 
Thats what I was looking at yesterday and ended up getting the ismember part down, ill be at my desk any see what exactly my question is in about 2 hrs 
Oh I just realized you probably don't necessarily want logical indexing. Probably normal numerical indexing using the second output from `ismember`. 
Ah, I didn't think of looking in the simulink settings to disable it; I was looking for something similar to warning('off') but turning it off in simulink should work fine, just fine. Thanks again!
If you view the mask, what should it look like visually? I get weird looking things, so I'm not sure if my numbers are right. Also I don't follow the part where I'm supposed to apply it to the image by converting it to an array. Where does the "double" come from? Apologies if my questions seem ignorant, I've just never done anything like this before. 
It's not "warning('off')" but I think you could try to replace your sim() command with the same command, but more arguments: % replace sim('your_model') with: sim('your_model', 'AlgebraicLoopMsg', 'off') You can stop here, but I want to convince you to try to not do this now. If possible, you should try to resolve the fact that there is a algebraic loop, for several reason: 1. algebraic loop make the simulation slower 2. you cannot generate code from the model (ok, most people don't generate code, so that's not a problem for most) 3. the results may not be what you expect. Long story short, a model with an algebraic loop may have more than one solution mathematicaly correct (or actually 0 solution, or 1), like when you have a second degree equation. If you have x² = 4, if a computer tells you x = -2, it's correct, but you may have expected the answer to be positive (+2). If you don't pay attention, you may have some problems. Simulink with an algebraic behave like this (granted, most of the time I get the expected solution, but in theory, you may have some surprises)
What I'm trying to accomplish is clearly spelled out in the original post. But in case you don't want to bother reading it: I need a way to resolve a recorded reference tone to a known frequency and take the corresponding audio along with it so that it's in sync with separately captured picture. There are a few different ways the reference tone was recorded but they're conceptually similar. The example above was just one method. I am simply looking to do digitally what has been done in the analog world for 60+ years - it works, reliably, and I'm not looking to reinvent the wheel. The issue is that the hardware to do it in analog is harder and harder to come by, there aren't parts readily available to fix the tape decks when they break and the engineers who have the institutional knowledge to fix them are dying off. These were specialty items, sometimes modified versions of off the shelf hardware, with little to no documentation. 
This is the exact command I was looking for. Thanks for the elaborate response. I am well aware of the other drawbacks of an algebraic loop (I just have to convince my supervisor to agree with me to put some effort in eliminating this pesky loop). For the time bein I am looking to stop Matlab telling me things I already know. problem 1 is actually the major problem; I a solving an EOM in simulink so "wrong" solutions are usually obvious, but the third reason is definitely valid!
That is not what you are trying to accomplish, that is the solution you have come up with to accomplish it. There may be better solutions available now depending on exactly what you want to do. There may not be, but you are more likely to get useful help if you explain what you want to do rather than how you want to do it (of course explaining both is best).
Sure. But my question isn't "what's the best way to accomplish this task" -- my question is "how do I do X?" As I said, I'm not looking to reinvent the wheel, i'm looking to emulate a system I'm familiar with after 30 years of experience with it. I don't want a new way, I want a digital way to do what I've done in analog for decades. An age-old problem with asking for help on the internet: Someone always thinks they know a better way. I have a specific need, and am looking for a way to do that specific thing in a tool I know little about. If I can't do this in matlab, fine. I'm here to ask if I can, and if so, how. It's a subtle distinction. I simply don't care if one method is slightly faster or more efficient. I just need to get something done within a framework I understand and can troubleshoot. Rather than telling me I'm asking the question wrong, why not just help someone else? Thanks
Too many different things im just gonna write a ton of for/while loops. At least those have been much improved since 2012
The mask will basically be a black and white image. All the white (value of 1) is the pixel you keep and all the black (value of 0) is the pixels you don't keep. The array comes from the object type. By default, logical statement produce logical arrays. However, you can't multiply logical array with a regular array (for example 6 x False would produce an error) , so it has to be converted to a numerical array, hence the double statement.
Having the same problems with my HP15 running on AMD Ryzen 3 and Radeon Vega, Ubuntu 18.04. Also found the problem in: [https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/419563-matlab-2018b-and-ubuntu-18-04](https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/419563-matlab-2018b-and-ubuntu-18-04) [https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/405904-matlab-crashes-on-startup-when-using-jvm-ubuntu-16-04-1](https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/405904-matlab-crashes-on-startup-when-using-jvm-ubuntu-16-04-1) but no solution unfortunately. I'll try switching to an earlier kernel, see if that works.
I you like, but this is a 2 line solution with ismember. In fact it's possible in 1 line but that would be ugly to look at. 
Yup used array2table(ismember(T1(:,1),T2(:,1) thanks! 
I finally got it! Thank you for your help 
Equations and how the graphs should look: https://imgur.com/a/z51fazs
Using 3 dots only splits the line in the editor window. It seems OP was trying to split the text in the command window.
Do you know how to transform a second order ODE into a system of two first order ODEs? Because that is really something that you should learn how to do by hand first instead of asking someone to provide it for you. It's an important transformation that will come up often when you are trying to solve complicated ODEs on computers, like the problem you have posted. 
I addressed that point in my first sentence. 
The toolbox is not compiled and the relevant line is in files/bear_toolbox_main_code.m
There's various ways to do what you're describing. One way, keeping with your 'set' paradigm for graphing, is to copy the object first, then set a new xdata/ydata: data = zeros(1,250); %preallocating data for performance time = zeros(1,250); graph = figure; drawnow limitrate; i = 1; tic; while(conditions for program to stay open) data(i) = (reads data from arduino); time(i) = toc; figureCopy = copyobj(graph,gca); set(figureCopy , 'xdata', time(1,[i:end 1:i-1]), 'ydata', data(1,[i:end, i-1]); drawnow limitrate; if i == 250 i = 1; else i = i + 1; end end 
You’re right, my eyes skipped right to the solution and I was hasty
Make a meshgrid of dimensions (lat,lon,altitude) and then use interpolator = griddenInterpolant(lat,lon,alt,data) and call it with interpolator(query\_lat,query\_lon,query\_alt)
thank you! I'll give that a shot and see where it goes!
Im guessing you need to break the input audio signal into 8 seperate chuncks, ach of which roughly covers a single lette, then repeate the workflow on each. Just sorting by the 8 best correlations doesnt guarantee your getting the single best correlation for all 8 of your letters
Yes, I know how to transform 2 first order ODEs, but these ones are confusing me a bit (variables dependent on time). I'm on a deadline schedule and just posted this to get as much help as possible. I'm reviewing diff eq and matlabs ode45 function this weekend to try and figure out how you would do it after you decompose them into 3 1st order ODEs. I'll post my work later for someone to check if I converted them right. 
It sounds like you want to use the [symbolic toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/examples/symbolic-matrix-computation.html) to solve for your coefficients with your variables. Is this helpful?
You could set a breakpoint in your xcorr loop and debug it line by line so you can see when and maybe why the problem exists. The Code looks okey to me.
Sure but I was referring to the sintaxis I have to us. What are my Syms and which ones not. Short of like an example of how could it be done. Thanks btw 
What kind of 3d plot? You could theoretically convert it to a stl or obj and open it in Unity drag and drop. I've done that before.
Just to be clear, griddedInterpolant won’t give you the closest location, it’ll give you the value at the closest location, if using nearest neighbor interpolation. Or, it’ll give you a blend of close by neighboring values if using the other interpolation options.
I’m pretty sure Mathworks has an online course for just that. 
https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/ 
Your syms will be x y and z (your unknowns) and you will need one equation per unknown. So, for the equations you typed, this is one way to do it: syms x y z eqn1 = x-6*y == 0; eqn2 = 5*x+9*y-z == 3; eqn3 = 4*y+6*z == 0; sol = solve([eqn1, eqn2, eqn3]); x = sol.x y = sol.y z = sol.z You can find more details on the mathwork site if you search "linear systems of equations"
Well, you have a lot of unknowns, but it looks like you could possible get away with only 4 equations focused on the **C** terms, one through four. The system of equations would need to be reworked a bit into an answer vector and a coefficient matrix. After that, the [symbolic toolbox in Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/mldivide.html) should be able to handle the rest.
It's a line/scatter plot of a wireframe structure with nodes that is animated. I have no experience with Unity. Any references you could share?
Thanks a lot dude. The problem is that how can I input variables such as "L" without finding values of this. What I meant is to get results in values of L. So to speak.
Thanks dude. I'll try it out.
you want *sortrows* instead of *sort*. 
I'm sorry are you suggesting that the symbolic toolbox should be used for solving linear equations.......in MATLAB....? This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever read on this sub. 
This was indeed my mistake. On every row, the highest (because descending) number was placed in the first column and because 24 &gt; 20, row 24 was inverted. Thank you very much.
https://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_plots/default-property-values.html this might be of use. You can use this to edit the Matlab's default plot arguments, such as the ones you mentioned. If you put those `set(groot, 'default...')` commands in the `startup.m`file you should be good to go.
+1, this sounds interesting!
If you have a grid with fixed spacing wouldn’t that just be something like div(x,dx)+1
Specifically, https://www.mathworks.com/training-schedule/matlab-for-financial-applications?class_format=SPO Right? 
I believe the OP wishes to solve for the values of C1, C2, C3, and C4 with respect to their variables B, L, w, and y. As such they wish to be given answers to a series of equations to see what C1, C2, C3, and C4 should equal with respect to these variables. So yes, the symbolic toolbox supports such functionality which is what I think the OP is after.
Let us support Scilab Xcos a Free version of Simulink
Normally yes, but I’m not going to be going along a fixed space. I’m moving in intervals smaller than the fixed spacing so I’ll be passing barely through some grid boxes and all the way through others 
You do not need loops or hoops to make the second matrix C2. C2 = C(:,2:3)
The new matrix is composed of the upper right 3 x 3 matrix and the lower right 3 x 3 matrix transposed. This can be done with indexing and transposing. C2 = [C(1:3,3:5);C(4:6 ,3:5)’]
 C2 = [C(1:3,3:5)';C(4:6 ,3:5)'] works like a dream thx
If you've spent all that time, have you tried reading the error messages? I can't help without reading your source, but the first error shows that you're trying to call a function that's doesn't exist.

Thanks! Exactly what I wanted:)
Hi again XD. I used syms c3 c4 w L By c1 eq1=3*L*c3+c4==0; eq2=((By*L^3)/9)+c1*L==(5*w*L^4)/24; eq3=(4*By*L^3)/9+c3*L+c4==(4*w*L^4)/3 eq4=(5*By*L^2)/3+c1-c3==(21*w*L^3)/4 sol=solve([eq1,eq2,eq3,eq4] The problem is that it game this [Wut](https://i.imgur.com/jntSFXT.jpg) and I dont want resulst for w and L. I want By in terms of L and w 
Nevermind. I got it. Thanks
Yeah I wanted to get the values of all my constants (c1,C2,...) And when finding those values I can find the value of By in terms of L and W. I already find it how. Thank a lot.
I think I fixed it. I added a period in front of the the divide symbol(./) of my equation. RV = ((w.\*R.\*C)**.**/(sqrt((1-(w.\^2).\*L.\*C).\^2)+((w.\*R.\*C).\^2))); (period is in bold). I don't know why matlab needs a period in front of the slash but ok. &amp;#x200B;
I thin
Matlab needs a dot to specify that you want to apply the operator not in a matrix way but as an element to element wayt. For instance A=[1 2 3]; B=A. ^2; B contains element of A squared. Note that A being a vector, A^2 is not defined due to size issue. You cannot mulyiolyba vector with himself. Btw: in your code, use the logspace(-2,7,100) instead of linspace. This will makes the bode plot nicer
Try the fill function [https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fill.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fill.html)
&gt;I don't know why matlab needs a period in front of the slash but ok. because dividing two matrices and diving each value pair in two matrices are very different
If you are interested in neuroimaging, try the SPM tutorial: https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/data/
There are a lot of routes you can go, so it may be most productive to focus on one particular goal or project. Someone suggested SPM, which you could use to measure brain data spatially if you have access to MRI scans (some data sets are available online such as HBN). Another is EEG Fieldbox which you could use to analyze brain activity temporally. If you want to include Machine Learning, a fun beginner project would be to classify brain waves into sleep stages.
I appreciate you reply, and made it work using this method.
That's a really cool homework. It should be a bit of work for a carefully prepared video. If it's for a random video, it will be a lot harder. I would do something like this: 1. Get a video. Maybe film it of yourself. Make sure that there are no disturbances in the video. Beware of high-frequency things, like flicker from some types of light bulbs and computer screens. Make sure that you are breathing rhythmically (maybe play a song in the background and make sure that your breathing match the beat?). 2. Post process the video. I.e. cut out the "best" part. 3. Treat the video as a signal and calculate something from it. Maybe total energy? I'm bad at image processing. 4. Calculate the spectrum of the energy (or whatever you chose). 5. The spectrum should have a peak at your breathing frequency. Done!
Matlab tells you exactly what the problem is: one of your indexes is larger than the array it is accessing. There are two suspects: 1. That the length of "CD" is lower than "frameinterval" 2. That "TrainingCD(end+1:end+length(frameinterval))" is invalid somehow. I would suspect the first option. To investigate: put a breakpoint on line 187. Make it conditional frameinterval &gt; numel(CD)
This really depends on what you're studying, at what level etc. But check this out to start maybe: http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/vidmag/ 
Step 3, an easy thing to try would be to run a feature extractor (SURF/SIFT/Harris, etc) on every frame and calculate the "centroid" of the feature on every frame. The time domain data could be the position of the centroid on every frame. Using the FPS of the camera, you can figure out the where the centroid is in every second. &amp;#x200B; I should warn though - this is very, very rough, and may not work at all depending on what kind of video data you have. If you're allowed to create your own video, I would put some kind of detectable feature like an ArUco tag, or a big green dot, on the chest of whomever you're capturing. 
You could learn the file format of a popular 3D modeling program. For example, Blender 3D (FOSS) uses [.obj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) to store vertex and face information. If you just have a 3D scatter plot with no face data, you could easily just export a file in the .obj format with a vertex from the plot on every line.
A naive approach is to set up thresholds like "Level 0 is a disparity between x and y", "Level 1 is a ...." and bin all the pixels according to that. You might be surprised to learn that segmentation is a hot topic of research especially due to its application in autonomous driving. The most promising techniques use [deep learning](https://sthalles.github.io/deep_segmentation_network/).
Exactly the place I was going to suggest starting!
Have you checked on the issues that those error messages describe? 
I have indeed although I keep running into more problems.
And what did you find? In the "unable to perform assignment..." situation, was the lhs indeed the wrong number of elements? Why? How did you address that? 
What class is this? This is a really cool problem
I’m not entirely sure. It’s not for a class or anything - I’m a maths student writing my dissertation on numerical solutions to stiff differential equations, so, I’ve had to self teach myself Matlab these last few weeks. I think it’s that I need to set up an empty vector(s) to input my y(i+1) values but I’m not at all sure how. 
Well, you're attempting to assign to a scalar. Is linsolve outputting a scalar? 
Nope, how do I assign to a vector? Thanks for helping 
You have accounted for that different random number generators are used? The results shouldn't be exactly the same. 
I thought since drand48 generates numbers between 0-1 I thought the closest one is rand() I knew that i won't get similar results , How I get a similar function as drand48 on Matlab ?
You should read the documentation section on indexing. If you want to specify a vector you need to provide more than just a scalar index. BTW in Matlab, i = j = sqrt(-1) so it's bad practice to use them for loop indexing. 
TrainingCD(end+1: ... ) looks super suspicious 
It's a good practice to use the word filesep instead of / ou \. It makes your code compatible with many plateform
This might be ignorant of me, but is it because the numbers generated by `rand()` in Matlab aren't guassian-distributed?
If you want Gaussian noise why not use randn? And why use all those loops? 
You're probably looking for the `hold` command. 
If you are at Uni, I suggest making sure you've installed the [Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/statistics.html). There is not a whole you can do to 'learn' Matlab unless you mean memorize specific commands. It supports classes and/or lots of functions in scripts so if you have some programming knowledge you will get on just fine. I am not entirely sure what you mean by data management, as you also bring up not being strong in math. Perhaps if you expand on your OP you will find others are better able to help you out.
Figure(i) right before each plot command where i is the number of that graph like 1,2,3... 
https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/randn.html I suggest you look at randn. I wouldn’t expect the same numeric results unless the C++ version is using the same random number generator seeded the same way.
Sound similar to my professor's project : Remote sound acquisition from video 
Thanks, I'll give it a try!!!
Model an action potential in an axon. It will teach you how to use ODEs in matlab 
*Hewwo sushi drake!* It's your **7th Cakeday** Carpetfizz! ^(hug)
Of course there's a way, but you have to decide what "compare" means in this context. 
Rank from best to worst on what criterias?
Check out the [MATLAB On-ramp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com) Spend 1-2 hours and you should be good to use simple functions and to get comfortable with the syntax. 
rand() and drand48() does similar things: they generate random numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. But if you have a program that only consists of "rand()" and another who only consists of "drand()", they will give you different results, since they generate different random numbers. The first program might generate 0.17436 and the second 0.71052.

This is a cool project. Are you allowed to put anything on the person in the video? Might be easiest to track a colored marker 
Yes I think I’m allowed to do that since there we no restrictions specified 
Awesome this sounds awesome thank you!
tracking colors in recorded or live video using image subtraction is fairly straightforward in matlab. check out something like this: [https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28757-tracking-red-color-objects-using-matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28757-tracking-red-color-objects-using-matlab)
The error message really does explain the exact problem: Your data is in a data type of table (which you mention in your write-up) and histogram expects numeric, logical, datetime or durations as the input. Thus, you have to convert your table into one of those formats. 
You've pretty much already answered your own question. The data type is a table, and the histogram function needs numeric inputs. Look up how to access the data in Matlab tables. Here's a reference: [https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab\_prog/access-data-in-a-table.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/access-data-in-a-table.html) Additionally, if adding code in your post, it makes it much more readable to paste it in a code block. Like this: % Histograms figure('Name','histograms') histogram(FEV1,'Normalization','pdf','FaceColor','b','EdgeColor','w','NumBins',10); xlabel('Volume (L)'); &amp;#x200B;
Thanks! I will look it up How do i paste it in a code block? I tried using 4 spaces before the code but it doesn't do anything... 
Thanks, i will do that.
i tried replacing FEV1 with FEV{rows,vars} to extract the data, but now i'm getting an other error. Undefined function or variable 'rows' any ideas?
i got it, i used FEV1.variable
Here's someone with a similar problem. They seem to have found a solution. https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/266306-how-to-normalize-a-histogram
The output shouldn't be 1200. That doesn't take cumulative interest into account. Your code should be correct. 
thanks, i replaced pdf with probability in the second line of my code, but now the area i 0.1, is the width of every bar 1 by default or does it depend on my unit/values, because my bars go from n to n+0.1 (ie:2.8 to 2.9) so if the width is 1 regardless, it worked. what do you think?
'probability' doesn't care about the width of the bar. Maybe try 'countdensity' instead? 'Normalization' has many options. 
that gave me huge values (&gt;200) hahaha i meant when calculating the area, is the width 1 by default, because it depends on the unit, if i used deciliters instead of liters, the width would be one instead of 0.1 
I had to do something similar previously, but I only used the histogram function to return the data and bins. Then I normalized the data to 1 myself and used the bins to produce my own version of a histogram plot.
okay i'll give it a shot thanks for the idea!
%%Formula for you op Borrowed = 1000; Rate = 0.1; Time = 2; NumRate= 1; %assuming this is annually compounded Debt = Borrowed*(1+ Rate/NumRate)^(NumRate*Time); 
Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure I won't be able to help you as I have no experience with what you're trying to do. But for to make it easier for other to help, you really should provide a bit more info. A sentence describing what you are trying to do and why. Any errors Matlab is giving you. etc.
Ok thank you for that I'll add in some more description
If you want troubleshooting, it is typically a good form to include the error message. Potentially also if you're on Win/Mac/Linux for stuff involving files. The simple answer is that you could try using some utility to convert the file into e.g. comma-separated values file (.csv), and then load that into Matlab.
Depending on how you control the colors in Matlab, there are different ways to set them. For plots you can specific a color via a string 'b', 'r', or 'k' what calling the plot. However, you can also pass [RGB values ranging from 0 to 1](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/matlab.graphics.chart.primitive.bar-properties.html). Your professor was instructing you to divide the values you found by 255 since those values range from 0 to 255 (256 steps).
I see what you are trying to do. I have tried to do the same many times. This is code smell: your code is probably "wrong" somehow. I'm guessing that you need the ranking to index some other data: * Can't you just sort the array? You can sort the other data the same way, Matlabs sort() is flexible. * Can you create a struct or class that holds the data instead of spreading it out over multiple arrays?
The array variables in question are the magnitude values of a frame of audio data. Sorting the array would mean the bins would go out of order and would essentially not make any sense when ifft. Sort works, just the B variable is somewhat redundant. 
Assuming your function is called myfun, you can type "which myfun" in the command window and it should return the path to the function. Delete that file and there you go. Also, be careful not to name your function with the same name as a built-in function. Hope this helps 
This is a neat problem. As long as your original vector does not get too large, you should be able to do this with repmat() and matrix comparisons. &gt;&gt; X = [ 4,2,7,5,9,12 ]; &gt;&gt; Z = repmat(X,numel(X),1); &gt;&gt; Y = sum(Z&lt;X')+1 Y = 5 6 3 4 2 1 I added +1 because Matlab hates indexing from zero, but you might not need that depending on how your write the next part of your code.
Thanks it worked
Protected models are supposed to be used in the Simulink version they were generated from. See here: https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/ug/use-a-protected-model-in-simulation.html#br65taf-1 You are using the same platform and version of Simulink used to create the protected model. The software stores the protected model as a compiled MEX binary. It might work by chance, but it's not recommended
You're not sorting you're data X in this way, you're using sort(X) to find the indices of a sorted matrix B. Check the documentation of sort(), the first output argument gives a sorted array and the second the original indices of the array B, sorted by decreasing magnitude.
ok....would the "generate S-function" approach work in such a case ?
no, you would run into the same issue, s-functions also should be used in the release they are generated in
Your problem is under defined. If you wish to simulate a point, it's a simple Dynamics problem, where you must define gravity, decide on friction, and produce a mass-acceleration diagram and a free body diagram for your analysis. If you want to simulate a real 2d ball, some approximations must be improved, and you must account for ball rotation, rotational inertia, slipe vs non-slip rotation, and other related concepts. Both of the above are relatively standard for an undergraduate mechanical.engineering Dynamics course. I can't offer you insight on how to animate this since I'm not familiar with that aspect of Matlab, but the above considerations should be useful for modelling the object. Good luck.
one way to animate is as simple as saving the calculation for each 'frame' and then running a loop where you delete the data and then plot the next time step, and then pause for some amount of time. It's not exactly perfect since it might not run smooth enough to look like an animation in all cases, but it's pretty decent.
Ya, for a point, I get that. I guess you could do it for a circle too and have the circle plotting based on updated coordinates. It's been a while, but I'm pretty sure the solution to OP's problem can be analytically done, so no need for a compute heavy loop or ode solver... Just store for very small timesteps and animate as you've mentioned.
Also, note that the math for a real ball will break down or get much much harder if your radius is big relative to the nose of the parabola, such that the ball might be able to contact both the 'left' and 'right' sides simultaneously...
Since he said it's a circle sliding, the math is effectively the same as for a point anyway, if I'm remembering right, just a little bit of scaling to make the surfaces tangent. However, based on the English used, it wouldn't surprise me if some portion of the problem is described less than completely accurately. Regardless, until OP shows some work that demonstrates an attempt to solve it, there's not much more to add imo.
This is a fair point, if it's touching 2 points at once, it's doing something that can not happen with a point, so I wonder if that's what's intended or not.
My Code I'm still fairly new to MATLAB so this is very much not optimal but... n=[4, 2, 7, 5, 9, 12]; n_test=n; value=zeros(size(n)); for j=1:length(n_test) [X,Y]=max(n_test) Test=rem(n_test,max(n_test))==0 z=find(Test) value(z)=j n_test(z)=-1.5 end 
Nah, circle vs point would have different math for most scenarios since a circle will have rotational inertia and a point will not. Only exception would, maybe, be in frictionless conditions, since friction is what would cause the rotation in the first point (unless an initial spin was placed on the object in question). This is essentially particle kinematics vs simple body kinematics. Both should have closed form solutions, if I recall... But it's been a while :).
Ya, op needs a bit more clarification before they can move forward.
I assumed 'sliding' implied friction-less since no mu is provided. 
Found a solution yet? i don't mind bad UI but when they actively breaks a working UI it really pisses me off.
repmat() 
I would probably use an uncompressed 16-bit grayscale TIFF for that.
It sounds like you are using the image processing toolbox to try to save your image. Those tools can certainly work, but may be "overpowered" if you are trying to do something simple, for example, by making non-intuitive choices in a lookup table as SynbiosVyse suggests. You can adjust those choices, but it may not be worth your time to figure out how. Is there a reason you are not displaying the data in a figure (with `imagesc(data)`) and then printing/saving from there? Do you need an exact size, or a precise mapping from bits to intensity? If you want to avoid the appearance of axes, you can add a `set(gca,'visible','off')` after you've made the figure, and you should see nothing but the image itself (with some additional space around the border). Slightly expanding on the all-black issue: most data in a 16 bit image does not actually have a 16 bit range (e.g. many cameras, even in scientific settings, have sensors that are only 10 or 12 bit). So different applications make different choices of how to scale the values in each pixel to a displayed intensity. If they choose the "low order bits", and you have 10 bit data, your *brightest* possible pixel is only `2^10/2^16=1/64` the maximum possible intensity, and all the pixels might get rounded off to black. You have to adjust the mapping from pixel values to intensities if you want the display to appear differently. There's also something I've seen on Windows that just garbles the display of `imwrite` output files, but I never tracked it down. 
I would go for something like a text-based adventure/RPG game. Program a bunch of responses to commands ('character' gives the stats/equipment, 'location' describes the room/area, 'fight' starts a fight, 'take' takes a thing, etc.), a short story, some NPC's, gear, etc. If that's not clear, [check out Zork](http://zorkonline.net/). Obviously include [the grue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grue_\(monster\)).
**Grue (monster)** A grue is a fictional predatory monster that dwells in the dark. The word was first used as a fictional predator in Jack Vance's Dying Earth universe (described as being part "ocular bat", part "unusual hoon", and part man).Dave Lebling introduced a similar monster, whose name was borrowed from Vance's grues, into the interactive fiction computer game Zork, published by Infocom. Zork's grues fear light and devour human adventurers, making it impossible to explore the game's dark areas without a light source. The grue subsequently appeared in other Infocom games, including Wishbringer. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/matlab/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Although some of the GUI components can be used for interaction, Matlab is definitely not the language for building a game. Another language with wider library access like Java would be better, because the students would then be able to extrapolate what they learned to other languages. Matlab is a closed language, and although it’s extremely useful, it is very application specific.
I need to preserve the resolution of the image. If I display as a figure in matlab it shrinks the resolution. I would also like to preserve the bit information. 
Maybe a board game like checkers or backgammon with the Matlab GUI. If you need more complexity, you can make a basic Artificial Inteligence to be the player 2
that expression will give you a complex number anytime t &gt; 1 since you'll have a negative square root. Is this expected?
I'm only showing the plot up to 1 (even though I set t to 4 I just realized. Habit)
it seems to be working for me with linespace(0,1) and the period before the division
Got it!! Wow such a simple solution /facepalm. Thanks for your help!
Make ticket a char array, use num2str on MAT (if MAT is a num), and replace element 2,2 by MAT.
MAT is the name. &gt;name = 'TOM' &gt;symbol = '*' &gt;ticket = * * * * * * T O M * * * * * * Thats what i want
alright I've got a meeting but gimme a bit and i'll get back to you with the solution
Thanks!! Ill send you my code asap
If you want to preserve the resolution when displaying it in MATLAB, I recommend imshow with Initial Magnification set to 100. However, you do need the image processing toolbox to do this.
Unless you are required to use a for loop, you do not actually need to use it. The initial error check is asking if any of the elements are not positive. How would you check if a single variable is positive? Can the same be done for an entire matrix? Once valid, you need to double only those elements that are odd. Odd and evens are either or, so they only change based upon the size of the matrix. Is there a way to find the size of the matrix and use that to build an index of which indices are odd (or even)?
So the size of the matrix is determined by the size of the word (in this case "TOM")? Will the matrix always be 3 rows?
This sounds like a great idea and definitely one I’ll pitch to my professor, Thank you!
 name = 'TOM' rowTicket = size(name,1) + 2 columnTicket = size(name,2) + 2 ticket = zeros(rowTicket,columnTicket) And this is what i expect ticket to look like: &gt; * * * * * * T O M * * * * * * 
Tbh all i need to know now is how to change the 42 in my matrix to a *
 integral is aware of singularities. https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/singularity-on-interior-of-integration-domain.html It may help to work in spherical coordinates.
just do char(ticket)
That doesn't work. It transforms ALL the numbers into an individual char. So "42" becomes "4" and "2"
dunno how you're using it, but char(42) def returns '*'
Will try this thanks :)!
&gt; I thought at first the first line of the *for*\-loop that sets B = A was overriding the *if* statement That is what's happening. Once you execute an if statement, you continue with the next part of the code. If you want to have two sets of instructions, you will need to use if-else constructions. One set of instructions goes in the 'if' block, and the other set goes in the 'else' block (if you need more, you can use 'elseif' blocks to add more conditions). Btw, there are more Matlab-friendly ways to do this checking, but I suspect your homework is focused on teaching loops and if-statements, so I've put the above advice with that in mind.
No problem with the edits and I’ll definitely look into these though I’m unsure about how hard this would be to get done and I’m not all that creative.
Can you share your code? `imwrite(round(randn(512,512)*65536), 'test.png')` works for me.
Hey thank you! I went based off your tips and got a pretty good mark on my assignment :)
Glad to hear it!
Yea, I understand that. That was in response to op's question 'Can't you just sort the array? You can sort the other data the same way' I thought they were referring to using the B matrix and creating the rest of the code around that. 
The first one is a fair bit of writing, and maybe classes if you're feeling fancy (structures or just plain ol' arrays would work too). The second is really just arbitrage; the goal is to buy low, sell high. Have the prices fluctuate based on supply and demand, etc. Have a random number roll to see if something happens each turn like getting busted by the cops or a bad batch of whatever. The third is hard, no doubt, but you could just restrict things like the size of the galaxy, number of ships and fittings, one player, etc. Each restriction would reduce the difficulty. No matter what you choose, there will be some degree of difficulty, and that's the fun of programming: figuring out how to solve the problems in front of you so that your program does the thing you want it to do! I hope it turns out to be a fun project, no matter what you choose to do.
There hasn’t been a reason to use inline for at least 15 years. Check out anonymous functions.
What the heck is inline and why can't that be an anonymous function? 
Are the EEG channels time series?
First, use ‘pwelch’ to get both the PSD and the frequency arrays (i.e. capture both outputs). If you’ve done that correctly, you would be able to make a plot of power vs frequency in Hz. Then, find the indices where the frequency is within one of the bands. Sum up all of the power values at those same indices. Then multiply the result by the frequency bin size - the difference between successive frequency values in your array (because what you are doing is integrating over frequency). Repeat for all bands you’re interested in 
Each sample is of code I'm analyzing is a recording of x minutes every day, so like 15 minutes Monday, 20 minutes Tuesday, etc. whatever. I split these all up into 30 second intervals, respectively, to analyze. So yes they are. 
I follow your logic completely and it is what I am trying to enact. I guess my question is simply how to sum up all the power values at each index? I am lost on the command to do this. I have found ones for averaging the power at each index, like I said before, but nothing for summing. Is it even a command or just math of sorts?
sum() https://au.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/sum.html
Shit is it really? The MATLAB website had me confused with: " The power of a signal is the sum of the absolute squares of its time-domain samples divided by the signal length, or, equivalently, the square of its RMS level. " as their definition of power of a signal. Do I just use sum(input,frequency dimension) and repeat for each interval of frequency I have?
You just sum the power for the indices where the frequency is within the bin e.g. `sum(P(idx))` and then multiply by `f(2)-f(1)` from pwelch. That definition for power is correct, but that's how you calculate power in the time domain, not the frequency domain 
Is each channel frequency specific? What is the sample rate, sorry I’m trying to grasp if fft and windowing is what you are after. 
Alright, I understand that thank you so much! Can you elaborate more on what you mean by f(1), -- ' the difference between successive frequency values in your array '? I don't think I quite grasp what you are saying, sorry. 
Each channel is not frequency specific, no, there are many different frequencies of neuronal oscillations in each channel. The sample rate is downsampled to 1000 bits/second. 
It's just saying, when you integrate something,you need to multiply your result by the difference between the points. It's exactly the same as the multiplication by `\delta x` in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule In fact, if you wanted to be a little more accurate, you could use the `trapz()` function to actually do the trapezoidal integration - doing `sum(P(idx))` is a coarser approximation (for other readers perhaps - it's sometimes preferable because it preserves some numerical properties of the dfft, for example if you want the power in the time domain and the frequency domain to match to within numerical precision as a validation check)
Oh I see what you mean! Thank you for the explanation! I don't really have a math background at all -- just neuroscience biology -- so I am learning all this for the first time, really.
You probably should learn to google and use the Matlab documentation, which are very good. You will need to do it in the future. &amp;#x200B; gamma = @(t) 1/30 + heaviside(t-90) \* (9/150 - 1/30); t = 1:100; figure plot(t,gamma(t))
Works fine: img_out = zeros(256, 256, 3, 'uint16'); img_alpha = zeros(256, 256, 'uint16'); color_grad = uint16(reshape(0:2^16-1, 256, [])); img_out(:, :, 1) = color_grad; img_out(:, :, 2) = rot90(color_grad, 1); img_out(:, :, 3) = rot90(color_grad, 2); img_out_alpha = rot90(color_grad, 3); fprintf('Write unique values: R=%u, G=%u, B=%u, A=%u\n', ... length(unique(img_out(:, :, 1))), ... length(unique(img_out(:, :, 2))), ... length(unique(img_out(:, :, 3))), ... length(unique(img_out_alpha))) imwrite(img_out, '64bit_MATLAB.png', 'Alpha', img_out_alpha, 'BitDepth', 16) [img_in, ~, img_in_alpha] = imread('64bit_MATLAB.png'); fprintf('MATLAB PNG unique values: R=%u, G=%u, B=%u, A=%u\n', ... length(unique(img_in(:, :, 1))), ... length(unique(img_in(:, :, 2))), ... length(unique(img_in(:, :, 3))), ... length(unique(img_in_alpha)))
In addition to what the other posters have said, there is also the "tiedrank" function: https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/tiedrank.html It ranks an array of numbers from least to greatest, so you can achieve your desired behavior with: &gt;&gt; rank = tiedrank(-array)
I can’t look at the code myself, but theres a good chance you want an if statement that uses the “break” command. If balance&lt;payment payment = balance End
Please don't do homework for people. 
how would i split an integral if it's just a point causing the singularity?
Answer is in the link ... and the title of the link.
Instead of starting B at 1, start B at A.
Sorry, can you elaborate? How would the code look like? If I ran it like this: for A = 1:1:5 for B = A:1:5 I assume the combinations would run as: A1B1, A2B2, A3B3, A4B4, A5B5, then?...
 for A = 1:1:5 for B = A:1:5 A1B1, A1B2, A1B3, A1B4, A1B5, A2B2, A2B3, A2B4, A2B5, A3B3,... And not a single A2B1 or A3B2 in sight. Thanks for that.
Hey, thank you so much! It does end where I want it to now and I'm able to remove the iteration step without causing the endless loop. However, I think I'm still doing something wrong as the payment did not change to be equal to the balance and still shows the value for the monthly payment. 
No problem. Also, just for your information, you could also have put the condition : if B&gt;=A DO STUFF HERE end inside the second loop, it would have been the same. It is just cleaner to start your second counter at A, because you don't do "useless validation".
Great, this is a more generalized solution that I can roll with in case I have a more complex problem. Also your username is pretty hilarious
From your description, I'm guessing that each time you change the slider, you are re-plotting the point, while "hold on" is set. Instead what you could do is just change the (x,y) coordinates of your data when you change the slider value. For instance, consider figure h = plot(1,2,'o'); hold on for i = 3:10 plot(1,i,'o'); pause(.1); end hold off In this case, you will end up with points at (1,2), (1,3), ..., all the way to (1,10). If instead you wanted to plot at (1,2), then at (1,3) only (without keeping (1,2)), etc, you could do something like: figure h = plot(1,2,'o'); for i = 3:10 set(h,'xdata',1,'ydata',i,'o'); pause(.1); end hold off Then this will appear to "move" the single data point across the graph without leaving a "streak" of the past positions of the point. If that is basically what you want to do, then you will want to re-write your function which takes the slider data to do something like the latter case. 
This has nothing to do with any 0s after the decimal and the issue isn't with the exp function. The error message literally spells out what is wrong. You are trying to index into a matrix using entries from zeta. Which entry of an array is the "0.1^th"?
 test(zeta); % This doesn't make sense. You are trying to index the variable "test" with the array "zeta". Matlab is telling you that this doesn't work, since "zeta" isn't an integer or an logical array. test(i); % Are you sure that you don't want to do this? 
Something like this: x = linspace(0,4*pi,100); y = sin(x); plot(x, y, '-') hold on h = plot(nan, nan, 'o'); hold off for i=1:numel(x) set(h, 'XData',x(i), 'YData',y(i)) pause(0.1) % drawnow end Instead of the for-loop, you'd be updating the point in an event-handler function responding to slider change events. 
So if you look into Fourier transforms. Sounds like what you want to do is Fourier transform then multiply by a window function then Fourier transform back. It’s basically a convolution with a top hat window function.
No worries, but definitely worth asking for help (especially within your lab). In my experience, people don't really learn FFTs in undergrad properly (unless doing it via engineering perhaps) - you might get Fourier Transforms in a third-year level maths course, but it's quite theoretical and a bit far removed from the actual hands-on steps required when working with discrete transforms. The way most people seem to learn is when actually working on projects. So your current knowledge as an undergrad is in line with what I'd expect, don't worry! Undergrad is a good time to be learning this stuff
Add an if b~=a 
Any chance you could give me your inputs (u,T,n)? Just to test with?
Yes ofc. I'll edit my post aswell. (\[0,0.5\]',5,0.1) &amp;#x200B;
Okay, well the problem begins with line 15: t=linspace(0,T+1,n); What's your intent here? A vector from 0 to T+1 (0 to 5) with 0.1 step size?
What I'm trying to do is to create a vector "t" from 0 to 5 with h step size, and plot it against the Y-vector. I'm not trying to hard code it because later on I will change the n to see the differences between the plots. 
t = 0:h:T+1 then
But in your function (w/ the inputs you provided), h = 50. How can you have a vector from 0 to 5 with a step size of 50? The first step results in 50.
If it might be possible to do it the first way, rather than with a conditional, it would usually be desirable to do it because it cuts out a LOT of operations
Thanks! That helped me realize that my input was wrong. The step size should be 0.01 and to get it I need a bigger n, so the new "n" is 500 instead. Now I get a vector" t" that's 500 x 1, and a vector "u" that's 501 x 1. So I'm closer to my goal. but I still think that the problem is at line 15. 
Is there anything wrong with defining t as t = 0:h:T? That would be starting at 0, with a step size of 0.01, ending at T = 5.
Ye I can see what u mean, going from what is essentially a permutation number of operations down to combinatorial is a huge ass chunk
"u" is still one row more than t, even after I defined t as 0:h:T. 
Err, I dunno if I'm doing something wrong, but "u" is 2x1 vector for me (when I make the replacement t = 0:h:T.) t is a 1x501.
Create new columns, like write to a new file? 
Thank you! That is good to know -- as far as what intervals of frequency go my PI wants me to "find the limit of each band in your f" (f being frequency). It turns out the variables for frequency intervals I was using were char variables, not num. Would I use the "bandpass" command for this? y=bandpass(f,[3 7],fs) sum(Power,y) something like this (for 3 - 7 hz)? My PI is rather hard for me to understand sometimes -- her native language is French haha.
start by reading the help file for "surf", it is also possible to use imagesc or contour.
The data shown is pretty clearly 2D. You could plot it in 3D, but I'm not sure how that would really look any different than it does here. Imagine a cube. Then imagine printing this out and sticking that onto one face of the cube. I don't think that's what you really want. &amp;#x200B; What do you mean by 3D? I'm not sure you mean the same thing as what Matlab means by "3D".
I think what he wants is instead of plotting coutour lines, make the z-axis represent the values labeled on the lines. 
For that you would have to change the definition somewhere in your loop and that depends on your specific code situation. 
The command window line is two separate codes. In the first one you are creating M_a1 and the second part you are creating a zeros matrix of 2x2. That is what ans represents. If you are looking for a complicated way to make the matrix you want, you have to use indices. Setting M_a1(1,1) = 0 would change the first value to zero, for example.
The comma is separating two commands. m_al=ones(2,3); zeros(2,2); Also, in MATLAB, you join two matrices using [], like so: x = [ones(1,3) zeros(1,3)]; I recommend you read the doc (or just play with them for a minute) on ones and zeros to see how they work. I can't figure out exactly what you were expecting with the inputs to those two functions and the expected output.
yeahhh , thats exactly what I want.
You can't write the variable "u" like that, ofc you're gonna get an empty vector. Idiot.
Thanks, your answer solved everything I didn't understand! :)
Yaa I can't figure out either heh, just started with Matlab today and didn't find any videos so I just play around till something fits, it mostly looks like a mess but I get the job done
Managed to solve my problem, but thank you either way!
Here is a list with 5 elements: [5 9 5 4 22] Please tell me what the value of element 3.7 is. 
if a&gt;2 continue else blah blah blah end 
I realize 'bandpass' command isn't what she wanted - she wants me to define the limits of my band on the x-axis of frequency. Do i want to do the 'xlim' command here then?
Whats the problem? Plot one figure, use "hold on" plot next. Or plot the first, open a new plot window and plot the next.
I work in the aerospace industry and I use it daily
Very valid question. It is used somewhat, but it isn't as prevalent in engineering as classwork makes it sound. It's convenient as a tool for 'prototyping' code because it can be made to work quickly and the syntax is easy. Particularly with things like image processing and matrix manipulations, it can be a good choice. I used it exclusively in all of my work as a graduate student to do image and data processing. I typically only see it used in a research setting however; it's common in academic research, and somewhat common in industrial research depending on the discipline. There are two main reasons it's not used as much in industry. First, Matlab is only really useful as a prototyping tool. It can do some things well, but overall it is not a very fast programming language. If you want to package something with an actuall consumer product, Matlab usually won't be the code base. Second, and this is related, the cost of licenses is an issue. You need to have a license on every machine that the code is running typically. If you're making a product, this isn't a great business model, and even if you use it for research work, unless you're a big company that can afford it, there's no need to use it vs. other free languages and IDEs. Additionally, there are other alternatives for programming in industry. In engineering, I've most commonly seen C/C++ used for embedded coding for most projects, and Python has been increasingly used as a prototyping and/or standalone processing base. Both are free, and have a lot more versatility; the downside is they can be more of a pain to deal with. IMO these two languages would give you the most utility in industry if you are able to learn them well. 
Optics/aerospace. We use it heavily. 
I use it outside of school when school is closed.
Great response. I started out with Matlab and have started using Python as my go to laguage for numerical processing. 
I do not understand your problem. Plotting a sphere into Matlab is a thing, generating objects for stl software is another one. For simple object as half sphere, using Matlab may be possible but it is likely to be over complex:any cad soft can do an half sphere. Matlab is a soft to do scientific computatio (to a very broad sense). Results may be exported to other software, but this is not the primary goal of matlab. 
Biomedical: Medtronic Inc uses it.
Matlab is targeting R&amp;D activities mostly. It used a lot in automotive R&amp;D for work related to 1d simulation, control and some code generation 
Used daily in aero &amp; power generation engineering.
Same, as my role advanced beyond new hire I’m starting to use it more. It’s faster than manually moving data between excel files. 
I eventually have to add points along the sphere according to an equation based on fermats spiral, and extrude those points at specific phi and theta angles. I figured it would be easier in the long run to make the sphere and points in mat lab then import in into a cad software like inventor or solid works. I know how you do it individually in inventor but there will be a minimum of 64 points to start with. The idea was to have a program that would allow me to input a specific radius, be able to change the thickness, and choose a number of points to plot along it with an offset. I do have code for the points in spherical formation in python. 
On top of prototyping, it's good for quick data analysis. Also I've seen a lot of internal development tools being made using GUIDE/app designer. Nothing you're going to ship, but just for internal use.
Both. You should of course know more than one language. The more you know, the better. At the same time, a lot of places use MATLAB. In Aerospace, for data analysis and prototyping, it seems to be a de-facto standard. Other industries, it is barely used. For a lot of places, it will depend on what the team you end up on uses. At the end of the day, Matlab is a tool and what is most important is to use the right tool for the job. 
I work as an ME doing air purification, use it almost daily for fluids calculations
Matlab, python, and C++ are all good languages to know 
OK I understand it better now.... 
I work in optics/aerospace. Matlab is critical to my daily life. 
My bad, I should have included that in the main post. Still, any suggestions? I'm trying to avoid individually making every point at the right angles. 
OK thanks for the clarifications. There are a few programs available on Matlab central. You should have a look there... For instance :https://fr.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/20922-stlwrite-write-ascii-or-binary-stl-files
I know that MATLAB is used EXTENSIVELY in the aerospace sector. So I think depending on industry, "There are two main reasons it's not used as much in industry" is incorrect. 
plot(x1, y1, x2, y2)
Any reason you can't just use spyder/python? Basically same thing at this point
Working in R&amp;D for a med device company, I used Matlab regularly for algorithm prototyping and data analysis. The team also used Python, C++, and spreadsheet software like Excel and Minitab. 
Are you sure you want to do all those matrix divisions? magic(3)/magic(3) ans = 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 That probably is not what you want to happen given you've used meshgrid to build specific instances of variables. magic(3)./magic(3) ans = 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Is what you get when Matlab is told to operate on an element by element basis, which might be what you are after with your script. I tried it and it renders when I insert the element-wise operator into your equation for **deltaP_prime**.
I know I need to do element wise operation, I just am unsure where it needs to be and where it doesn't if that makes sense
In every car made after like 2010ish, on Mars, in tons of the aerospace platforms in use, R&amp;D, data analysis, etc. Learn Simulink too and the impact increases drastically.
Could you reply with what you tried??
Usually everywhere if you’re not intending to do matrix calcs. 
From a cursory look I _think_ all of your 2D stuff wants to be element-wise. 
I do neuroscience research and use it to analyze imaging data, analyze electrophysiology, and great computational models.
I made every division element wise.
Yeah I know about that, the thing is that I have for the second figure F2 = real(sqrt(9\*(X\^2 /2 + Y\^2 / 2)-1)+3); (it's a hyperboloid of one sheet) and I don't know how to set the 0&lt;z&lt;6 limit that I need without messing the axis and therefore the previous figure.
Emm... what?
Simulink, all the matlab toolboxes, support services, also matlab is faster in certain areas than python
You're cutting off the rest of the statement, which is 'as much as in classwork'. I'm not saying it's not used at all or minimally; it's even used quite a bit in my field as well (medical imaging). It's quite true that it isn't as prevalent in the majority of industries, and certainly not as a production code base. 
But in the aerospace industry I am saying it is used as much, if not MORE than in coursework. So your comment is heavily industry specific. 
It's pretty standard for controls applications. So automotive, aerospace, some robotics, etc.
Again, that is literally what I said in my original comment - it depends on the sector as well as the type of engineering you are doing. The whole point was in response to the question, which is regarding compared to school. All engineers learn matlab, but the majority do not use it in industry specifically. It is not pushed in college because it is a ubiquitous programming language for engineering. 
Chemical Engineer here. MATLAB is used at all the companies I've worked for (includes a major oil &amp; gas company, and a major chemical company). 
Admittedly still at school, but I moved from a mechanical engineering degree to a creative music technology degree (disappointing the parents with maximum efficiency) and, being a bit familiar at MatLab and thanks to their awesome sound package, ended up prototyping a cool original sound fx plugin. Once you get into it a bit, it's a brilliant tool at your disposal for a huge variety of stuff. I think "oh I could do that in Matlab quickly", whilst other people are faffing about with Excel or random software, way more times than I thought I would. On the other hand, it's one of the most expensive bits of kit and a lot of smaller employers may not be able to afford it. However, all the skills, methods and applications of Matlab are quite easily transferable, so don't worry too much about whether or not what you're learning is valuable.
Looking for jobs?
I wrote an automotive diagnostics interface using matlab, I believe many companies use matlab for making automotive software. You find it a lot less now due to partnerships such as AUTOSAR.
I work in neuroscience research. If I didn't know Matlab I'd be screwed - it's absolutely critical to my work. But yes, look at other languages. You don't want to be a one-trick pony. Python is also very useful, although (in the neuroscience world at least) Matlab is still more widely utilised. We also use R a lot, but I'm not sure whether R is useful for mechanical engineers. 
You probably want to use [meshgrid](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/meshgrid.html) with either [surf](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/surf.html) or [contour](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/contour.html?). 
Worked. Thanks for the help. Any idea why it doesn’t matter if I do element wise operations on the ^?
I’m an analytical chemist and I specialize in chemometrics (advanced data analysis). MATLAB has been invaluable when I need to do my own data analysis using algorithms/codes that simply don’t exist in software.
I'm going to assume you are asking about squaring terms? maigc(3)^2 versus magic(3).^2 If so, it does matter *but* both operations return a [3x3] matrix. However their values are different, thus you likely need to adjust that as well in your equations to make the values correct.
Same here! Did PhD in ephys, currently work with in vivo imaging. Only drawback (and the one case where I've had to use python) is that in working with an HPC cluster, matlab is of limited use because a limited number of licenses are available, effectively preventing me from using more than a tiny fraction of the cluster's resources (basically not much better than my workstation).
What DO you know how to do in matlab? I thought you just needed help plotting 2 things at once. 
Oh nvm, I didn't realize you were plotting in 3D, sorry 
I'll give it a try. Thanks again. :)
Such an interesting mix in this sub... a ton of engineers, but then always a sprinkling of neuroscientists. What kind of stuff do you do? I did my PhD in in vivo ephys, and now I do in vivo calcium imaging. 
Yeah I know about that, what I mean is that for example I have one figure already and the second one is F2 = real(sqrt(9\*(x.\^2 / 2+ y.\^2 / 2) - 1)) + 3 and I don't how how to give it the 0 &lt; z &lt; 6 limits that I need without messing with the axis and therefore the previous figure.
Just in case it gives a better insight the first one is F1 = -X.\^2 / 4 + Y.\^2 / 9 and I used fsurf(F1,\[-5 5 -5 5\]) to set the limits but it only seems to work with x and y limits.
Major defense contractors...we have tons of data.
I worked with it in a geological context and a climate modeling context. 
Ha, yes!
aerospace, mechanical, whatever. matlab's great. I like python better personally for most things, but there's a lot that's just so damn convenient with matlab. it's used in industry.
Can confirm! Signal Processing and Machine Learning at MDT
Optics. My friend works for MagicLeap, and thats all he uses.
I got to where I liked PythonXY as a great all in one package (including spyder), but it looks like it isn't updated anymore. Is there an equivalent these days?
Im not sure about Z limits in 3d plots in matlab. Have almost never used the feature. This should be a quite googleable question tho. You cant be the first to wonder
What about finance?
I think that instead of changing to gray tone do it to black and white tone and increase the pixels range, like: A = im2bw(imread('Capture.PNG')); and add the 'objectpolarity' to 'bright'.
can I ask why? it seems like C++ or something like it would be heavily preferred. do they allow you to install and run compute on matlab on academic clusters? here they are getting stricter with badly optimized code wasting compute time. especially our aerospace guys.
Ok! Don't know why you got wrong vectors tbh. Thanks for your help, it made me realize that the input was wrong first, and afterwards I managed to find the error to why I got an extra column in my vector. 
The frequency with which I write an application-specific piece of analysis code would make C++ completely impractical. Compute power is way cheaper than the time it would take to do everything in C++. Besides, a lot of day to day work isn't massively computationally demanding. On very rare occasions, there will be something that we intend to reuse frequently and needs to be very efficient, which we will write in C++. That is extremely rare. 
I see, I've been pushed to use matlab for a class and I'm very confused by it. let's say i write a script and want to run it on a new server instance with let's say Ubuntu 18.04 clean install. how do I do that? like with python I can just sftp the scripts over, ssh in, do apt install for my stuff and then type python3 filename.py. 
Just like with python, you have to have Matlab installed on the new machine to run your code. Unfortunately it's not as lightweight as python and you can't treat a .m file as an executable the way you can a python script. At least not as easily as can with python on \*nix. Matlab has its downsides but in a lot of industrial settings the upsides matter much more than the downsides.
Excel is for managers, accountants, and children. It's the ez-bake oven of analysis tools. 
You'll probably need to modify the existing plot components (via set/get) rather than repeatedly calling plot() in the slider callback. 
Mostly in R&amp;D. Simulink is super useful and the application specific toolboxes are great for analysis and save a lot of time over C++ or python where you would have to write the functions yourself.
Matlab neural network implementation is far from being optimal, to my opinion, with respect to all the available framework (pytorch, etc). Simply Matlab. Is not today specialized in neural network. It only provides some basic functionalities and misses some important ones (automatic differentiation, etc). First check that the neural network toolbox gives you all the required layers. Matlab includes the capability to generate some c++/cuda code, which is really nice. So if Matlab neural network capabilities are enough for you, then maybe using the code generation plus a c++ main program could be a solution. 
I've seen some interesting Matlab projects on the internet and given the simplicity of Matlab, it seems the most time saving. But let's say it is lackluster, what software then is capable of doing the three things mentioned, and do them simultaneously (note that I am not planning on using external hardware boards to do the speech processing)
that's the only way I know how to make functions, I don't know what an anon function is
Set the x, y, and z axis limits manually after plotting everything, with: set (gca,’XLim’,[xmin xmax],’YLim’,[ymin ymax],’ZLim’,[zmin zmax]); 
Also used in most cognitive psych labs (especially vision research) primarily because of a toolbox developed in the late 90s for stimulus presentation (PsychToolbox). Some are starting to switch over to Python, but the tools (psychopy) aren't quite there yet. 
I'm an electroacoustics engineer and I use MatLab on a daily basis. It's used in most R&amp;D / Engineering jobs, really. 
What would you consider an "acceptable latency"? MATLAB, in general, is not optimal for most real-time applications. Depending on what you need to do, I would expect you would need to spend time coding in C (via a MEX file) to optimize the throughput.
https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/function.html https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/anonymous-functions.html
just import it and then resize the matrix. I think the command is called reshape or resize or something to that effect.
My main question is are the numbers the height, rows the x, columns the y?
B = reshape(A,sz) reshapes Ausing the size vector, sz, to define size(B). For example, reshape(A,[2,3]) reshapes A into a 2-by-3 matrix. sz must contain at least 2 elements, and prod(sz) must be the same as numel(A)
I have no idea. Where did the data come from?
It's a text file an old coworker left 
Do you have any idea what the result is supposed to look like? Also are the values of x an y likely to be small integers? I would format it a few ways and plot it until it looks like I feel it should look
Surface profile of a sphere 
Is it a delimited text file or was it really just written in no particular order?
To be more precise. Yes Matlab should probably able to do things. Simultaneously, maybe. Will it be the more efficient way to do it. I don't think so. BUT it is possible. If you prefer Matlab than other soft due to the simplicity of the language and all the high end features provided, then it's your choice and why not after all. If you do not want to I vest your time in c++ coding it is a possible alternative but I would also have a look at python+some Api that should also be able to do things more efficiently. Nb: I use Matlab everyday as for hybrid vehicle energy management and other control tasks. So it is not about trolling about Matlab capabilities but discussion its suitability. 
Are you doing ODE45 in a loop? Maybe able to assign it to 3d matrix. Output(:,:,i) 
I am running the ODE45 in a for loop. I thought the output for an ODE 45 was only \[t, y\] At the moment I have my y being a (1,7) array for 7 coupled ODEs. Are you saying I can alter my y output argument to include those outputs?
So it's a 1024x1024 matrix where the row represents the x, y is the column and number is the height (z). Howver when I read it using dlmread I'm getting a 1024x1824 matrix
Have you tried using the import feature? It allows you to view the data and rearrange it as you require.
The issue I'm getting using dlmread is its getting a 1024x1824 matrix but I thought it should be a 1024x1024. At least that is how the code to write to the file was written
That’s what is taking up most of the time. Extracting values from ode45 will not take that much time as it’s just an array of numerical values. You should abstract ode45 to handle higher dimensions as opposed to running it in a for loop.
That works thanks! Gives me struct with data (1024x1024) now just need to figure how to get matrix out,
I need to run it in a for loop due to my material properties changing after every time step and because of discontinuities surrounding the problem. Within the ODE45 I get a function listing and the time for each line. For example the line below eats up a lot of my time. Time: 5.708 Calls: 610000 Line 794: global Q\_dry Q\_wet 
Yeah I feel that. I don’t think there’s a way to reasonably cut time of your program unless you set your changing material properties as a state in your function file if that’s possible. I’d also shy away from using global variables from a practical standpoint but I doubt that even that would cut down your time
Are you the same person as OP?
Its used in analyzing animal tracker data, or at least for elephant seal trackers
Hello HAI_LISTEN, I hope you have a wonderful day!
sutely it is basically already a matrix?
Theres a setting for output (drop down arrow). The default is structure or table and you need to make it a matrix.
I know what you mean by avoiding global variables. I was desperate and tried to see if it would improve the speed over Evalin function.
Aw, thanks automated program
Is q a matrix of solutions from ODE45? What is the size of Q and does it grow each iteration? How many iterations are you running? Basically what I’m getting at is are you preallocating?
I mean, you can define something by writing it down. What do you want to *do* with it once you've defined it?

I don't know all the details of your problem, but I think you should find a way to run the integration without the loop. If you have material properties that are a function of time or y, you should preferably implement this inside the rate function. 
Ah, I'm not a cellular neuroscientist - my background is cognitive neuro, but these days I'm working in the clinical neuroscience dept of my university. My work primarily concerns cochlear implants - specifically, modelling current spread in the cochleae of implanted patients. It's something of a strange situation for me; although I'm technically part of the clinical neuro dept, I barely get to do any neuroscience! It's mostly engineering and ENT stuff (my prof, and most of my colleagues, are ENT surgeons. We operate out of a dingy little lab nestled within a hospital. Could you tell me a bit about your work in calcium imaging? I must admit that I don't know much about it. 
The q's are simply doubles. Heat flux from the nodes. They don't grow each iteration. I have 3 nodes that I'm interested in and after each iteration returns the heat flux from different phenomena (condensation, evaporation, etc). My time steps are really small 0.001 and I'm running to about 1200 to 12000 seconds. Thousands of iterations 
I may be off-base here as this is /r/matlab but if you need something custom done have you thought about using something like C++ or even just python using numpy + numbajit to speed it up? I'm sure you can code up your own runge-kutta 5 step algorithm (as long as you don't need tolerance measures which can make it tougher), and then you can use it as you please. Should give you significant speed up.
I'm starting to see more and more people use psychopy - the kind of people who would have been using e-prime a few years ago. You're right, the tools are crude, but it's impossible to avoid the impression that python will be widely used in this field in the near future. For the sake of my own professional development, I'm spending a lot of time learning python, even though I barely use it in my current role. 
PsychoPy has a point and click GUI which you can use for basic experiments like presenting text or pictures on a screen that does not require doing any actual programming. I suspect that's part of the appeal (and the fact that it's free). If you want to do anything more complicated than that, you have to insert code snippets or write the whole thing without the GUI.
The question is a bit vague, but assuming the values are in ascending order and you wish to find the row with the first value greater than 100 it would go something like this: elements = 1:numel(data,1); index = data&gt;100; row_num = elements.*index; The first entry of row_num should be the row index of the first time it exceeds 100. Then remaining entries, if any, will be the ensuing row numbers. 
I work in automotive and without MATLAB it would be hard to do anything. Starting at signal analysis of measurements, simulations of a vehicle dynamics, functionality of car subsystems and ending in code generation that is used for production. You would be surprised how many software components are now made with Matlab/Simulink for automotive. I assume similar thing is with aerospace industry.

If what you’re saying is true then q is 3x1? So you never actually get a as a function of t. 
A = rand(100,3) * 100; % 3 random columns B = A(:,1) &gt; 50; % find where in columns one values are greater than 50 index = find(B); % this will return the number of the index where value is greater than 50 If you would like to know how many numbers are greater than 50 you can use for example N = sum(B); 
This worked great! Thanks!
Thanks!
Isn't this the normal output of ode45? 
Why is this NSFW? 
Why is this NSFW?
lmao
why lmao? bad idea?
To get people to click on it and see what the question is probably lol
extract the total power of the bands in those intervals (sum all the power up within those frequency bands). 
Besides examples in textbooks, there are almost never equations already derived, ready for whatever situation you're trying to model. Most of the time you have to figure it out. 
Because ode45 is runge-kutta and Matlab's solvers are fast
yes of course they are, unless you need to extract values after every step, which is OPs problem I thought. then they become extremely slow. what OP is trying to do is not the intended use case, RK45 is runge kutta implementation for matlab is not meant for this type of single step compute.
Why do you need to monitor the heat flows after every time step? ode45 chooses step sizes dynamically, so it feels off that those are the specific times that you need the heat flow values at. This might be an [XY problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem).
I' realized I can just just evaluate my heat flows as a function of temperature after my ODE finishes. I just have to store how my material changes after each iteration and evaluate my heat flow equations with my ode solutions. Much faster to do it all at once at the end vs every iteration.
Yes you can try to do it. You basically should try to look at the image regression problem with image as output. In Matlab, you just need a table with the file name of the input image in one column and the output image filename in a second column. Concerning the neural network structure, it depends on what kind of effect you want to learn but a kind of hour glass approach should work. Maybe add some skip connections. You may be inspired by all the work on image deblurring and super resolution (plenty of papers available, just Google). 
You should be integrating PSD over the frequency ranges, not summing. You need to account for the bin width
Just a stupid idea... Why not using simulink? It may be more flexible than Matlab and you may be able to dynamically update the parameter by programming them as part of the dynamics. You can use state flow and S function to do so. Or maybe you can use the stop block to stop the solver when a condition is met. This way the solver could be running many steps (since running a standard solver for a single major step is unefficiant) 
That's a valid point. I've never used Simulink before. Perhaps ill look into it.
Post your code. 
I have a few questions, i'm assuming image regression is a type of NN setup, how would I choose for matlab to create an image as the output. I see what you mean on only working on a certain component, either h or s, I don't know what V is. Before I only had one pair of images and was trying to do this using fft's but was suggested to use an NN. Would using information from the fft of the original and/or processed image be useful or could be analyzed in the same way? I would want the NN to account for both a non-linear and linear effects if that is any clue of what I should do. Also not sure of what is meant by skip connections
I'm not sure if this will work... But outside the loop initialize your output as Output = zeros(length(tspan), length(output), length( iteration steps)) Inside the loop and below ode45: Output(:,:,i) = y
This example demonstrates the workflow you are describing. https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/examples/image-processing-operator-approximation-using-deep-learning.html Any Fully Convolutional architecture would likely work. This one uses a CAN. Using U-Net is another popular choice.
Edited
how would I go about doing that? Sorry, I am rather new to all this
Sample data too? Is it possible there is some garbage value in there? 
There is something called Simulink IO on Arduino that can help you do the processing on the computer and while peripheral communications on the Arduino. &amp;#x200B; You can check out the video here - [https://youtu.be/vw3DH6\_P30w](https://youtu.be/vw3DH6_P30w) . This should give you an idea on the implementation. 
A ground truth of simply "good" seems pretty subjective, and I doubt the model would perform well. You're correct that conv nets are the way to go. 
My good measurement would occur statistically for sure. Thanks for your suggestion!
 B=zeros(50,10); for j =1:10 for i=1:50 if j==1 B(i,j)=i; else B(i,j)=i+j-1; end if B(i,j)&gt;50 B(i,j)=B(i,j)-50; end end end for k=1:10 eval(['B',num2str(k),'=B(:,k);']) end This is another way to go about it. Will result in 10 column vectors 
Maybe add `shading interp`.
As /trialofmiles I would also suggest looking at the doc examples:[https://fr.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/examples/image-processing-operator-approximation-using-deep-learning.html](https://fr.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/examples/image-processing-operator-approximation-using-deep-learning.html) This is exactly what you are requesting. The main point is that you did not really explain what you want to do. What is you "unknown effect". This is strange, since to apply the effect, somehow you have a code for it. So why is is code not sufficient. Why do you need to approximate the effect of this code? If you want to work with FFT, I would try to model the "transfert function". BTW, I come from the control engineering field, so apologize for not using the correct terms, but I'm pretty sure the following is a correct way to do it although it may need adjustment for image (2D), I'm used to do this on 1D signal: compute Filter(w)=FFT(imgOut)/FFT(imgIn) with imgOut and imgIn some patches taken on input &amp; output images. Probably you would have to average to "smooth" the filter. Then to get the kernel, I would use invFFT(Filter\_average). &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
I'm planning on pitching proof of concept and with the help of voice command I want to manipulate visualization. So understandably, I hope not to wait more than 4 seconds in order to see the effects. So what does the processing chain look like? (My speech) =&gt; \[MATLAB speech processing =&gt; MATLAB deciphering speech command =&gt; MATLAB issuing to FPGA over UART =&gt; FPGA command processing =&gt; FPGA displaying something on the screen\]. I guess 4 seconds is optimistic to say the least right?
Thanks for the advice, I will look into those.
I just tested this, it worked like a charm. I think it's what you're looking for. 
It's a method for recording the activity of many individual neurons in an awake and behaving animal. Either by injecting a virus or by some germline manipulation, we cause some of the subject's neurons to express a protein that fluoresces in the presence of calcium (when excited by a certain wavelength of light). We then implant a very small lens, terminating right above the brain area we want to image. When it's time to do a recording, we attach a miniature microscope (weighing about 2 grams, and also containing the excitation light source) to the lens, which the animal wears on its head. This captures images, where bursts of a neuron's activity are visible. I don't actually do any of that, though, my job is all data analysis.
Can you give us a bit of a fighting chance on this one? There's a good chance it's reading of NaN because your input at some point is a NaN, run it line by line until you stop getting real number values and start getting NaNs. Not all functions treat NaNs the same way. If I had to guess, put in NaN flags for your min/max - https://ch.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/min.html 
Step through each command and watch the values of the variable until you see something that isn't what you expect. Aka, debug it.
Considering that "data should be coming from this part of the code" part defines exactly none of the variables in "filling in this part", I'd say that you should read the code carefully to check what part is doing what. If you aren't using functions (which have their own namespaces), it is also a good form to load only the data you need and occasionally clear your variables, so that if you've forgotten to define a variable you aren't using one that you've defined manually (and then later on forget to define that and wonder why previously working code doesn't work any more).
In solidworks you can define many features using parametric equations, this is probably true in most CAD software. Working out the equations for your system then applying them directly in the CAD software is probably the easiest way to go about this.
It's not throwing an error because a Nan is not the result of an error. Standard IEEE math operations have well defined and allowed behaviors for Nan inputs and outputs. You've simply written code that doesn't do what you want. Matlab doesn't know what you meant to do, only what you actually told it to do. You should try basic debugging techniques. Look at your code. Run it line by line. See where the actual behavior diverges from what you intended. Then fix it. 
It's used with control systems in the electrical engineering industry. 
not exactly sure what your question is here, but if it's related to importing data from .txt files: check out the build in MATLAB gui. MATLAB will automatically generate a function for importing the data. Generate a list of the files you want to create using the dir() function. Loop through the dir and open/save the data with the import function you just created &amp;#x200B; Top Bar &gt;&gt; HOME &gt;&gt; IMPORT DATA &gt;&gt; Generate Function
&gt;zoombackcameraa &gt; &gt;1 point &gt; &gt; · &gt; &gt;3 minutes ago You are right but I do not know how to loop it. Steps would be: 1. Import data with part name that contain in the name "20170104" 2. Save this work-space with name "data\_20170104.mat" 3. Than import name with part name that contain in the name "20170108 " 4. Save this work-space with name "data\_20170108.mat" 5. And so on with hundreds of file with different names as described. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
It looks like your script is working well, but maybe you need a new colormap. I'd recommend viridis because it's what I use. https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/51986-perceptually-uniform-colormaps There're also plenty of others built in to Matlab. https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/colormap.html
Thank you for your help! Actually jet seems to be pretty good for color maps :) 
Oof... Jet is common but that doesn't mean it's good. For example, you can't print jet in black and white and anyone who is moderately color blind can't use it. There're lots of journal articles on why not to use jet. In general, it doesn't matter much but you should be aware. https://www.kennethmoreland.com/color-advice/
That is true! Thank you for your insights
I think you will need to see it. Matlab won't scale it ubless you told it to in the script
As zoomback says, I would approach this by using the directory (folder) which contains all the files. The basic steps I use are: 1) use "uigetdir" to select directory name 2) use "dir" to get a list of file names 3) Create a for loop to go through all the file names generated by the output of step 2 (all steps labeled 3 are inside the for loop) 3a) create the full file name by combining directory path and file names using "fullfile" 3b) Variable = load(fullfilename) 3c) save( nameyouwant, Variable) &amp;#x200B; Note that you may want to create the "nameyouwant" from the original file name but I would recommend replacing the '.txt' extension but cutting and replacing the string. Any manipulations you want to do to the data should be done between steps 3b and 3c. You can also use the import function instead of load in step 3b, or use a series of fopen(), textscan(),fclose(). Hope this helps. 
Nvm, I think I got it. The values were near zero so it was rounding down, I just used format long g and it works now. Thanks for the offered help tho! Cheers, Jartopian
It's a 1024x1024 matrix so I don't know the best way to share that data. I'm semi confident the issue is due to having too many points. IF I index my matrix to 100x100, I'm able to see the mesh grid.
Try setting the linestyle to 'none' and see what that gets you. I would double check your data and make sure you don't have any NaNs or other junk just to be sure. 
I see. Well I am glad you sorted it
How do you transfer the data from the arduino to MATLAB? 
That’s exactly what I’m trying to find. I can connect and interface them, but I can’t transfer the Data. 
Aha I see. SD card is a real easy option however you mentioned the word "online" so I guess it's not an option
Function blocks work by acting on the input `u`. In this case, it's simply taking the element in the second row of the first column on the first page of the 3D array fed to the input, and passing that to the output `y`, hence `u(2, 1, 1)`. In context, this makes sense as it's taking the first non-DC signal out of the matrix (i.e. "Get the First Harmonic A"). You can read more about [function blocks starting here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/simulinkfunction.html).
I've done this before. I set up a serial object to connect to the serial port that the Arduino is using. Then, I wrote the software on the Arduino so that all of the data would be tranferred over the serial port. Then just write a receiver end in MATLAB to get the data and then plot it as it comes in.

Not sure what your question is. I would recommend first working with import data GUI and get your data in a usable format (numerical array or table). Once you have the data organized it seems as simple using figure; hold on; plot(X,columnh11); plot(X,h12) etc. 
Thanks for idea, I will have to try myself and not sure how good will I be but I will get back to all of you. 
First thing. PID is not designed in the way you have in the model, look in Google or YouTube how it looks. Second thing which signal do you want to control, and make a feedback from only that one signal, don't put any gains in the feedback, unless you simulate sensor with that gain. When you implement the PID correctly (there is a block in simulibk), you can use Simulink autotune or use more analytical approach like root locus.
Just realized that you might wanted to use full state feedback for pole placement. You should look at it.
Your are not doing pid but a state feedback. Then assuming the state matrix to be A and the input matrix to be B, then the pole placement is achieved by the 'place' command: L=place(A, B, [p0, p1]) Where p0 and p1 are the desired closed loop poles (you need as many poles as the system order) and L the state feedback gain. These are the values to be entered in the simulink feedback gains. They are the entry of the matrix L. For instance, choosing real negative values allows avoiding damping. By the way, there is a numerical restriction with the 'place' command: all the p0, p1, etc must be different. They can be as close as you want but not equal: for instance use p0=-3 and p1=-2.9999
Oh Thank you. I will try this method . 
I can potentially store them and use them later , but for now I need Real time data plot . Thanks for the suggestion 
You could do this with strcmp() and find(). 
I have said this about the PID control loop to my supervisor before and he is adamant that the way I have it now is correct and stabilization can be achieved with this process. But that's my problem, because of how he wants it done I can't find any effective way to tune the system. The A matrix in the model is a 4X1 matrix of state data hence the 4 output avenues of output data. From what he has said the entire system emulates PID control and a well tuned system should be achieved. It's a pain in the ass. There's 4 different models I have and by feeding back certain data from the model it should be able to be stabilized depending on what control input is in the system. At this point I have a stable system, it's just trying to get it in accordance with design requirements I am having problems with. I'll check out that simulink autotune though and see if I can place a PID controller Infront of the state space model and just feedback the data with no gains. Will post update 
I'll have a look thanks
Sorry I haven't posted in this sub in a while. But in another sub I belong to once your question has been answered, you are supposed to mark it NSFW to indicate it's been answered. Just a bit of a habit.
AHH ok, I'll look into the full state feedback systems and how to tune them. Only got two weeks before the final report is due for my dissertation and I've worked my ass off to try get this far and feel like I've fallen at the last hurdle
https://se.mathworks.com/hardware-support/arduino-matlab.html Seems like theres lots of info on the matlab webpage
https://se.mathworks.com/help/supportpkg/arduinoio/examples/getting-started-with-matlab-support-package-for-arduino-hardware.html?prodcode=ML Here is some examples. Seems like MATLAB has built in support for wifi/BT/USB communication.
You need to add a LOT more detail. ANY text editor (including text edit) will be able to create text files that can be loaded into matlab. You just have to format them correctly. Often text files are comma delimited to tab delimited. What have you tried so far? What is the data you’re trying to load? 
I've used pwelch for a similar thing. If you message me I could send you my script...can't don it now tho 
What is this
Well, linear interpolation in 1-d is pretty simple to check with known values and query points. If I was to guess, I’d bet my entire life savings on MATLAB being the correct answer.
You might try out WebPlotDigitizer to get ideas for how to approach this issue. Personally the interpolation feature has been really useful for me when the data points shares a color with other parts of the plot.
Thank you for the feedback. So,am I correct in assuming the matrix we obtain from the FFT block is composed of elements of the various harmonics of the signal? And the element corresponding to u(2,1,1) denotes the first non-DC signal out of the Matrix? 
Matlab 
That would be my guess, based on what's in the model and how it's labeled. I didn't make the model, so I can't be sure.
Thanks. I would think so too, seeing as the FFT block is producing elements with various harmonics from the input phase A. Could you help me in understanding how to know that the element at u(2,1,1) would correspond to the first non-DC signal component?
It was indeed, I just used the wrong scale when interpolating with matlab... 
Thanks for the offer, but you don't have too. I'll take a quick look myself at pwelch.
Lots of options here, but you need to be clear about the format of your .txt or .dat file. Could use [importdata](https://mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/importdata.html), other ways to do it too. 
You should have a read of the [FFT block documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/dsp/ref/fft.html), and then back out of the subsystem you're in and track down where the signal labeled 'Phase A' comes from. With that information, you should hopefully be able to determine what's what.
In your application, do you care about the real and imaginary parts as separate quantities, or would visualizing the complex numbers in terms of magnitude and phase be more useful? I’d recommend 2 3-D magnitude and phase curves based on how I generally use complex numbers.
I want to be able to see the path taken in C^2 so taking magnitude wouldn't work for that. I'm not familiar with using phase curves, how does that work? 
Magnitude and phase is still a view of the same C2 information, just encoded as a magnitude and phase angle. For many applications, that would be a more meaningful view of complex data than the real and imaginary quantities viewed separately in 3 dimensions. 
That's a good point. I was thinking that it wouldn't extend well to the idea of viewing a path but phase might be a good way to go especially for looking at large scale behaviour. 
&gt;simulink Extracting the Y values is not the problem, I have something similar written. I want to extract certain values using the final Y values after each iteration: q\_0=U\_0\*(Y(1)-Y(2)) For example I want to know what q\_0 is for each loop. Using assignin or Global returns q\_0 for every single time within in ODE45 until it converges. I just want the final q\_0 for the converged y values.

I didn't see you say C2 until I clicked in from mobile, so this isn't as good an idea, but I visualize 4d data with video footage of 3d data usually. But you need an isolated 4th variable to sweep for that. I've posted a video on making videos in matlab on my youtube before. In your position, given you want the gradients, I know of no good solution where you don't implicitly set a term gradient to zero, because the plot location and the vector have different dimensionality for any 2d or 3d plot you might do.
I've found this to be the best tool for saving videos in matlab https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/63239-gif
for ODE45 you need a file which includes your EOMs only and another file which is your integrator. You specify your tspan and initial conditions in the file that has your integrator. Aslong as you have the same amount of initial conditions as you do for outputs of the ODE it should work.
After you have all the data, sounds like you can parse it for what you need outside of your ODE/ loop
I forgot that the ODE45 calls a function and that I could use the solutions to my ODE . I did exactly what you mentioned. \[\~,q\_0,q\_12, q\_23,...\] = myODE(tspan(1,n+1),Y(end,:)) [https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/92701-how-do-i-pass-out-extra-parameters-using-ode23-or-ode45-from-the-matlab-ode-suite](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/92701-how-do-i-pass-out-extra-parameters-using-ode23-or-ode45-from-the-matlab-ode-suite)

Hello guys. I have a home work, I am try to do 6 pulse controlled full bridge rectifier but for trigger to gates of thyristor I have to use Pulse Generator but I do not know how to use thşs block. Can you help me?
Yes, and put a semicolon at then end of each line to suppress the output, as in: x = [...] ;
My philosophy : if you need to do it more than twice, automatize it. I would do something like that. I just give you the sketch, you will have to adapt. 
Thanks i'll try it when I go to the library this week.
Could I ask also - what will this graph look like? I am find with just a blue line and a red line with points.
Something like this https://waterprogramming.wordpress.com/2014/09/18/scientific-figures-in-illustrator/amp/
One last thing... do I put a semicolon at the end of each line apart from the last line(ylabel('mev'))? Thanks again
Not having semicolons won't throw any errors like in c++ I would just write the code and experiment with it to get what you want. Stack overflow and Mathworks forums will be your friend here

You generally put a semicolon to suppress whatever output you don't want to see on-screen. However, all of these commands, apart from the ones where you actually define the x, y1 and y2 vectors, have outputs you either can't or will see, no matter what. For instance, the set() command is like changing the settings, no visible output there. Or the plot() command that opens up a new figure, but it does that no matter what you put at the end of the line. You have to play around to understand what commands give visible outputs and which ones don't, but I have found a general rule is that when you define something or make a calculation, the output will be visible. I suggest you put semi-colons only to suppress the output of commands that define and calculate stuff, because it is a dangerous practice to suppress errors, unless you really really know what you're doing. 
Use the demux block with 6 outputs to separate the gate signals. The alpha input to the pulse generator is the delay angle in degrees. You can leave the block input unconnected. [Here's](https://i.imgur.com/LMnoohk.png) an example image of how to wire everything.
Am I misunderstanding this? If ypu already have the data in Matlab just assign it in one go. P1_stat=A.data(:,2)
Well, yes I have all the data here. But I would like to split the data into two trials for everything so that every variable would have a \_t1 and a \_t2. I could assign everything in one go but I would then have to worry about specifying the exact array components every time a calculation is done for specific trial. &amp;#x200B; That is one way to do it, I'm just trying to simplify early so that it's less complicated later on.
I like your philosophy. And thanks, very insightful - i'll mess around with this and see if I can get anywhere with it. This seems like it'll also be useful in the future too.
Good practice would be to save this code in a file named "bisection.m". Then, in a separate file in the same directory, define your function and interval and call the bisection code. It would look something like: a = 1; b = 2; f = (x) x^3-2*x^2+10*x-20; p = bisection(f, a, b); The key is really in learning how to define [anonymous functions](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/anonymous-functions.html), and how to create and call functions from other files or subroutines.
Most likely the error you're getting now is because you're trying to put a function in a script. If I recall correctly, you can't do that. A script is code that is not encapsulated by function \[...\] end, and if you try to put a function inside a script it won't work.
Pexit_t1=A.data(1:5,2) Pexit_t2=A.data(7:end,2) 
I set up the files as you suggested but I'm not sure what i need to do next. Do I modify the 1st line of the code function p = bisection(f,a,b) ?
What happens if you just run the second file?
actually can I just define f in the command window?
Then I get an error in line 4 (p= bisection(f,a,b))
It would help if you said what the error message was. Did you save the bisection.m file in the same directory that you're running the script from? Read up on running functions: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/create-functions-in-files.html Also looks like my info was out of date, as of r2016 you can put functions in scripts. I last used 2015.
Is your issue with coding in general the logic or the specific commands you need?
It's a bit of both. I think i don't understand the basics yet, and then my professor gives us homework assignments that are extremely difficult to understand because he gets either too wordy and overcomplicates the problem. so i think that if I learn the basics, then I may have a chance at tackling these problems better. 
So for the logic the best way to think about it is, in my opinion, to originally not think about how you would code it but the underlying math behind the issue. For learning commands, MATLAB has excellent documentation both online and in the program. If you ever need help with a command type "help" and then the name of the command. If you want to know if there is a command for something Google can be your best friend. 
 I added an axis and pause command after my plots and moved my "for" statement to the top encompassing everything with one more end statement at the bottom and the simulation ran. 
Here's a quick-and-dirty solution using [regular expressions](https://regexr.com/49ffq): function tab = parse_equation(eq) tok = regexp(eq, '([+-]\s*)?(\d+)\s+x(\d+)', 'tokens'); tok = strtrim(cat(1, tok{:})); coeffs = str2double(strcat(tok(:,1), tok(:,2))); factors = str2double(tok(:,3)); tab = zeros(1, max(factors)); tab(factors) = coeffs; end And some examples to verify results: &gt;&gt; tab = parse_equation('2 x1 + 3 x2 &lt;= 9') tab = 2 3 &gt;&gt; tab = parse_equation('2 x2 + 3 x4 &lt;= 9') tab = 0 2 0 3 &gt;&gt; tab = parse_equation('- 2 x3 + 1 x1 &lt;= 9') tab = 1 0 -2 One limitation is that you cannot omit the coefficients, e.g `2 x1 + x2 &lt;= 9`, you have to use an explicit "1" `2 x1 + 1 x2 &lt;= 9` 
I think the main problem is that you're probably trying to start writing your solution in MATLAB code the second you start working on the homework assignment. First, you should try to solve, or at least sketch out, a solution on pencil and paper in simple math. Think about what kind of algorithm you'll need first before trying to write computer code. Also, MATLAB is a terrible first language to teach engineering students and engineering schools should stop teaching "programming" courses and should instead teach "algorithm design" courses, but you don't really have a say in that at this point...
Yep. Think to yourself, "If I were doing this problem with a pencil and paper, how would I do it?"
In addition to what the others have said, I'll take a stab and offer a specific suggestion that at least seems to be useful generally: **logical indexing**. Matlab handles loops comparatively slowly, so while for- and while-loops might get the job done eventually, they tend to be inefficient in larger data situations. For example: suppose you had a vector A of randoms between 0 and 1 (as is default for `rand`), such as `[0.1; 0.48; 0.82; 0.37; 0.63; 0.75]`. If you wanted to produce some vector B that contains only the values of A greater than 0.5, you *could* write a for-loop that runs for each element in A and concatenates it to B if it's greater than 0.5, and be sure that this will work. In fact it will be instantaneous as far as you can tell because A only has 6 elements. But if A were a vector of, say, 30,000 elements, this code would be slow to finish. Loops of this type work especially slowly because an array (B) is repeatedly changing size—and you do not know how many elements *N* it will have in the end, so you cannot pre-allocate it as an N-by-1. Logical syntax does the job in one fell swoop and completes very quickly. With your vector A whose size is N-by-1, you could get an N-by-1 of logicals (1 for true and 0 for false) corresponding with whether the values are &gt; 0.5 with `A &gt; 0.5`. I know of two one-step ways to make B such that it's a vector of the values of A &gt; 0.5. The first and more obvious is `B = A(A &gt; 0.5)` and the other is `B = A(find(A &gt; 0.5))`. Note that "A &gt; 0.5" stands alone in both cases—its result in both these cases does not depend on the function for which it's used as an argument. If A is that from the example above, `A &gt; 0.5` gives the logical `[0; 0; 1; 0; 1; 1]`, so `A(A&gt;0.5)` is the same as `A([0; 0; 1; 0; 1; 1])` where the 1s and 0s are logical (not doubles, not integers). The function `find` is more useful (in my opinion) for finding starting values or "first cases." This is accomplished by including a second argument that gives the number of terms wanted to be found that satisfy the condition of the first argument. For example, `A(find(A&gt;0.5,2))` gives `[0.82;0.63]`. Had you wanted only the first value (0.82), you'd have used `1` where I used `2` Well there's a beginner crash course on logical syntax. I hope you found this helpful and useful!
Commenting to help you get some more traction here. u/brimacki gave good advice, and then once you know the steps you need, try to google the actual syntax for that. It'll help to memorize (you'll need to) the basics like how to store and alter a vector/matrix, linspace, rand, plotting, etc. Sometimes your best friend is copying old code you made so you don't have to memorize every bit of syntax. My only original point would be: do all the steps above, and then GO TO OFFICE HOURS! If you can get in front of the prof/TA and show them that you have made an actual attempt (this is vital), they can help get you the rest of the way, or farther, and will see you as a model student. Good luck!
thank you so much for this response!!!! It's so helpful! I feel so dumb taking this class, but it's required as an engineering student. I've gone to tutoring, and I'm still having a hard time with this class. I can do math and physics all day long, but this stuff is a bit complicated. I hope that doesn't mean I can't be an engineer. Anyhow, I'm very thankful for this response. Appreciate it!!!
I'm happy to help! Feel free to message me whenever you have more questions. I first picked up matlab 2 years ago (and had no one to help me learn it) and had absolutely no idea what I was doing. Wasn't really until this past year that I've gotten the hang of it—and it's now one of my favorite tools and I use it every day! I'd be happy to share what I know
I will take you up on that because I really feel pretty clueless taking this. If you don’t mind, I would definitely appreciate the help. :)
What does the documentation say? 
The easiest option is to make a for loop that iterates over possible values of x and finds the best fit. But that's pretty naive. You seem to use solve() correctly. Is the payper() function broken? Does "payper(0.08,30,0.1,0,0)" work? What does it return?
That's not how symbolic math works. But you don't even need or want to use symbols. You're trying to obtain a numerical value, right? You want to use fzero. 
Are you trolling? 
Thank you for your help, but when I run the simulation the voltage output is like that [https://imgur.com/bw6sjhq](https://imgur.com/bw6sjhq) It should be like that [https://imgur.com/WSjt7Gx](https://imgur.com/WSjt7Gx) . Why is it so? 
Haven't used Matlab in a while so might be a bit rusty on the syntax but I think you'll want to have a look at the ismember() function. It would be something along the lines of the following: If ismember(x, A) &amp;&amp; ismember(y, B) Do thing Else ismember(x,A) || ismember(y,B) Do thing
Try x==A should give you an array with conditional values
x = \[0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 3.72\]; y1 = \[3.7174E-05 3.6500E-05 2.5909E-05 2.0186E-05 1.1587E-05 7.5309E-06 2.6081E-06 6.1819E-07 0.0000E+00\]; y2 = \[5.7765E-06 5.6523E-06 4.4921E-06 3.1057E-06 2.5458E-06 9.1415E-07 5.1943E-07 6.5605E-08 0.0000E+00\]; set(0,'defaultFigureColor','w') set(0,'DefaultAxesFontSize',18) plot(x,y1,'LineWidth',2) hold on plot(x,y2,'LineWidth',2) grid on xlabel('Distance (cm)') ylabel('Deposition Energy (MeV)')
Hi again, if I type the following into MATLAB will it produce my graph or do I need to add anything else? I would like to add a legend (y1 is detector 1 and y2 is detector 2) but I don't know how to do it. Thanks again! &amp;#x200B; x = \[0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 3.72\]; y1 = \[3.7174E-05 3.6500E-05 2.5909E-05 2.0186E-05 1.1587E-05 7.5309E-06 2.6081E-06 6.1819E-07 0.0000E+00\]; y2 = \[5.7765E-06 5.6523E-06 4.4921E-06 3.1057E-06 2.5458E-06 9.1415E-07 5.1943E-07 6.5605E-08 0.0000E+00\]; set(0,'defaultFigureColor','w') set(0,'DefaultAxesFontSize',18) plot(x,y1,'LineWidth',2) hold on plot(x,y2,'LineWidth',2) grid on xlabel('Distance (cm)') ylabel('Deposition Energy (MeV)')
That’s the issue. It looks like a no ?

While I agree with your premise- that logical indexing it amazing, your specific reasoning is incorrect and I think illustrates bad coding practices. First off, the concept that `for` loops are slow in MATLAB hasn't been true since 2016a. The JIT since then automatically vectorizes for-loops for you. So while I still prefer to writing vectorized code for ease of readability and compactness you don't actually get a speed-up from it. Secondly, your example of "not being able to pre-allocate B" is a bad example because you should always pre-allocate your arrays. If you don't know the final size, pre-allocate them to the maximum size they could be, and then chop them off at the end. So in this case, you could make B an array of zero's the size of A, keep track of how many elements you add, and then remove the trailing elements. In fact, if you did this, it would be the exact same thing that MATLAB does when you use logical indexing. So, yes- you should use logical indexing. It is powerful and fast to type and very transparent to anyone reading your code what you're doing- it's a great trick. But I just don't think for the reasons you say. 
This is literally exactly what I was looking for. Thank you so much!
Hi Dimitris, do you know how I could add a legend to this? Y1 is detector 1 and Y2 is detector 2. &amp;#x200B; x = \[0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 3.72\]; y1 = \[3.7174E-05 3.6500E-05 2.5909E-05 2.0186E-05 1.1587E-05 7.5309E-06 2.6081E-06 6.1819E-07 0.0000E+00\]; y2 = \[5.7765E-06 5.6523E-06 4.4921E-06 3.1057E-06 2.5458E-06 9.1415E-07 5.1943E-07 6.5605E-08 0.0000E+00\]; set(0,'defaultFigureColor','w') set(0,'DefaultAxesFontSize',18) plot(x,y1,'LineWidth',2) hold on plot(x,y2,'LineWidth',2) grid on xlabel('Distance (cm)') ylabel('Deposition Energy (MeV)')
Thank you this is what I needed!
That should work. Without testing on a computer though I can't say 100% unless you tell me if the code produces an error. As for the legend another user posted a useful link to some Mathworks forums. 
&gt; Secondly, your example of "not being able to pre-allocate B" is a bad example because you should always pre-allocate your arrays. If you don't know the final size, pre-allocate them to the maximum size they could be, and then chop them off at the end. So in this case, you could make B an array of zero's the size of A, keep track of how many elements you add, and then remove the trailing elements. Well I didn't want to assume we were using logical syntax to get the job done. Totally agree with you, but it's beside the point I was trying to make
My solution would be: 1) Create a for loop to loop over each value of the first column (aka number of rows). 2) use an if statement to check if A(index,1) == 4 3) assign index value to a vector if 2 is true 4) The index vector will have all the relevant rows, pull these from the original matrix into a new one.
You want to match a value stored in column one of a matrix and use it as an index for the native matrix? new_data =data(data(:,1)==4,col_selection);
Thank you! This is exactly what I was looking for. I had something very close to this at first, but I messed up the indexing slightly so it was giving me an answer that looked correct but was pointing at a different set of values in my matrix.
As long as there's no real competitor for Simulink, MATLAB won't suffer.
There is a Block-Model Simulator in Python (still far from Simulink)..so I guess it's just a question of time.
I believe that the price has actually gone down. Not sure how far further you can haggle that... but our local beancounters did agree to buy an everything-included total academic headcount (i.e. no limit on consecutive instances running) license instead of our old license server.
My comment was unnecessarily specific. Simulink certainly gives a major boost to MATLAB, but it's not just Simulink. MATLAB has a dedicated support structure, Simulink, and a number of other very useful toolboxes. On top of this, it's pretty easy to use, plug and play, has excellent plotting capabilities, and honestly is just generally easier to use. Python is great, don't get me wrong, but the syntax can be somewhat confusing.
There is also octave which is basically open source MatLab
I found that doing math in Python with numpy and pandas is kind of a pain. MATLAB will remain a more straightforward math and plotting package. R is probably a more direct competitor. For example: In MATLAB, a matrix is a matrix. In Python, it might be a base Python array, a numpy array, a pandas data frame, or a pandas column. There are so many different data types, it's a struggle for me to write code that doesn't produce type errors. In MATLAB, functions always take the form of function(). In Python, some functions work that way too, but others are methods so you have to evoke as object.method(). 
There are still some areas where it's not totally compatible. I was working with another software package written in Matlab (called USPEX), and ironically, the error handling it used only worked in Matlab and would just crash out on Octave.
Is MATLAB usage in universities decreasing? I'd be interested in seeing the stats in it. And I'm not sure MATLAB is "prohibitively expensive" for universities. I think they cut them a really good deal, precisely for the reason you mention- to get people hooked when they go onto careers. 
Industry places high value on solutions that are a complete package, with all the tools you'll need, professionally curated, and with continuous tech support. I'm not an uncompromising Matlab fan boy, despite being a power user. I think Python is great for scientific computing and I'd encourage anybody to learn it. But just being good on technical grounds isn't the whole story in the real world, and Matlab isn't going anywhere. 
 &gt;1) Create a for loop to loop No. Stop. 
Matlab is losing ground because data science and machine learning are becoming increasingly popular. No one in their right mind would do serious work in either of these with matlab and no one in industry uses matlab for these purposes. I use both but the only times I use matlab is when I need to access some package that isn’t available in Python. I could also never get away with the terrible coding conventions and restrictions that matlab allows/enforced in a production environment.
As a general rule, if you are an expert in MATLAB and think you need to use `eval` then maybe you need to use `eval`. If you're a beginner in MATLAB and think you need to use `eval`- you don't need or want to use `eval`. Eval is evil, and the only reason it's not removed is because out of a million people who think they need to use it, 1 of them do. I know this sounds hyperbolic, but I it is hard to impress how bad of an idea this is. Basicallyh, whenever you think you need `eval` most likely you need to use a data structure, like a cell array or structure. I know you think "well, I want them all in named variables named for the trial they are" but while maybe that's easier when you have 2 or 4 trails, what about when you have 200 or 400 trials? Suddenly, having all of your trials as separate variables sucks. This seems like a [cell array](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/cell-arrays.html) might be your best bet- put each trial into a separate cell, so trial number is indexed simply by which cell you are in. 
&gt; In your case, I would use the eval function A much better sentence would be "in no case would I use the `eval` function." The eval function should almost never be used, and instead a data structure should be used to store your data. 
My experience is vastly different. Most companies DON'T have a license. From what I have seen, I'm tempted to say that 99 % of all engineering calculations are done in Excel (including VBA). But perhaps others can share their views on this 
I agree with you, but that's not the point of my post (i.e comparing the merit/limitations of Matlab). 
Don't have stats in hands...but I know of a few big universities turning to Python (and now Julia).
A disgusting amount of industrial stuff runs on top of Excel. I'd personally guess that by number of installs Excel is probably the most common ERP and MES (Enterprise Resource Planning; Manufacturing Execution System).
&gt; Given the prohibitive costs for a Matlab License, Do you actually know how much it costs for a university license?
I mean, there are a lot of companies in a lot of industries. Any one person only ever gets to see a small fraction. I never said all, or even most companies are using Matlab, but certainly a lot are. People doing engineering calculations in Excel are likely not in particularly high end markets. I can tell you that designing a space telescope in Excel would be like catering a royal wedding with an ez-bake oven.

other answer is better, no contest.
You're either creating a new file on your path called audioread.m, or changing your path to include a directory containing an alternate audioread.m. When the problem occurs, try running `which audioread` and see what it says. 
Running which audioread just returns: C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2018a\toolbox\matlab\audiovideo\audioread.m which I think is expected. From what I can see a new audioread is not being defined, but I'll keep looking.
Matlab isn't losing any ground, it's simply not growing in the machine learning field. It's still in heavy use in other areas. The conventions and syntax of Matlab aren't bad simply because you're less comfortable with them. I've seen Matlab, and implemented it myself many time, in a production environment. It may not be perfect, but robust code can absolutely be written in Matlab by a sufficiently skilled author. 
Expensive enough that most University have a limited number of tokens. This creates limitations on campus (max number of users) AND the students have to buy a license to use it at home (a lot of them use illegal copies).
Then I was wrong about the cause of your problem. After the error occurs, go to the line where it happened and place a breakpoint. Then run it again so you can see what's happening. 
Maybe it isn’t losing userbase but it is losing market share (anecdotal). I beg to differ: matlab conventions and restrictions are bad full stop. I’m completely comfortable with them because I’ve been using it for 3 years but learning other languages have shown me of deficient matlab is. Matlab doesn’t have proper closure. Matlab only allows for one function per file. Matlab encourages writing scripts rather than properly object oriented packages which doesn’t scale. Matlab doesn’t permit the usage of global vars in one file like a config. Indexing by one isn’t ideal. Matlab is locked to one IDE.
Actually, you were totally right. It's just the wrong version of the assert() function that was being used, not audioread. How should I go about ensuring the default assert function is used instead? Thanks!!
There was recently a thread on this exact topic. https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/avhrt9/where_is_matlab_utilized_outside_of_school/
&gt; No one in their right mind would do serious work in either of these with matlab and no one in industry uses matlab for these purposes. This seems to be a hot take as [Medtroinc does not see any problem with hiring](https://jobs.medtronic.com/jobs/data-scientist-33628) such staff. &gt; Experience with machine learning and statistical modelling algorithms &gt;MATLAB experience &gt;SQL language &gt;Medical data analytics (e.g. data discovery, pattern recognition, machine learning and data modeling algorithms) &gt;Experience developing clinical decision support algorithm using data driven informatics
First of all, that’s an engineering firm. Second of all, they have Python in their “desired” qualifications. Looks like someone is trying to port their codebase.
Do you know how much a commercial license costs? 
Students getting hooked in illegal Matlab will provide more lifetime revenue for Mathworks than students who only buy legal student copies. Let's assume a 5 year bachelor degree (thanks, Co-op!), 2 year masters, and 4 year PhD. That's only $1100 USD to get a student license every year. The "standard" license for Matlab costs close to that per year.
Using the standard of where “engineering calculations” are done is a low bar for any programming language because most engineering calculations do not require programming. My company is in the top 500 design firm and while we don’t use MATLAB on the daily, but we have it available. My company is also a large global company so it naturally goes breadth in technology offering instead of just what needed at hands. I think your “most company” quantity may be biased toward your personal experience. 
There’s a lot of misconceptions and not totally accurate information out there. Academia is a huge area of interest for MATLAB and in fact, they’re opening campus wide licenses one after the other to give students access, so it seems like it would be going the opposite way. Secondly, there’s the misconception that a commercial license costs thousands of thousands, and while for major corporations this is true when they have a lot of licenses and deep tool chains, it’s not true for the majority. A license costs $860 and there are other programs including a startup program where you can get the tools for just a fraction, plus all of the support and resources that alternatives don’t have with it. 
I’m a course leader for a Maths course in a UK university and we are moving from MATLAB to Python. The reasons for this are demands from industry, students asking for Python, Python now being taught in schools and that it encourages better programming practice than MATLAB. From the research we did into other similar institutions we aren’t alone in doing this. 
&gt; No one in their right mind would do serious work in either of these with matlab and no one in industry uses matlab for these purposes You should share your conclusions with Gardner to help them to avoid the mistake to suggest that Mathworks is a big player in that sector next year. https://rapidminer.com/resource/gartner-magic-quadrant-data-science-platforms/
Manchester, Liverpool, ucl, Bristol, Hertfordshire and Edinburgh are moving to python at the moment.
Python syntax confusing .......
“Only vendors with commercially licensable products are included”. You may want to read more closely the things you link. 
God no if you are actually decent at data science you would never use Matlab 
&gt; Do you know how much a commercial license costs? Yes, I know. Do you often answer to a question by a question before answering it? Fun fact, you cited 6 tech firms in your comment. 5 have jobs offers containing the word matlab.
An academic student license is $50 or $100 for students (I know because I have one) while commercial licenses are ~$2300 per seat (I know because mathworks reps try to sell them to us every year). It’s a fact that data science and software development are dominated by python relative to matlab and for good reason. If you don’t know that, you haven’t spent much time doing either seriously.
I am an engineer with 15 years experience and I've never worked at a company that didn't have a ton of MATLAB licenses. All three places I've worked gave me a stand-alone license a number of toolboxes.
Yes, Python tries too hard to be super generic and it honestly just makes things worse.
Sounds like you’re treating it wrong python is a base to work on. Once you decide how to go about your problem and selected the tool sets it’s far from generic . 
&gt; “Only vendors with commercially licensable products are included”. You may want to read more closely the things you link. I keep my comment exactly as I have posted it. You say: "No one in their right mind would do serious work in either of these with matlab and no one in industry uses matlab for these purposes" The Gartner analysis is basically saying that using Mathworks product says "Yep, that's definitively something usable for that purpose". The fact that Python (I guess that's what you mean) is not evaluated don't changed anything. If "no one on their right mind would do serious work" with it, it should not be listed there. &gt; Once again, show me that these large companies are using matlab as their language of choice and I’ll change my mind. You can’t because they don’t. Is ASML big enough for you? https://mathworks.com/company/user_stories/asml-develops-virtual-metrology-technology-for-semiconductor-manufacturing-with-machine-learning.html
Don't name functions the same as other existing functions. 
It can do all those things, and you can use any IDE you like, although the debugger is proprietary. The OO features aren't great but they aren't bad and they're improving. Although it's debatable whether technical computing ought to be OO anyway. It sounds like your complaints are more symptomatic of your own programming habits. 
&gt; “As a process engineer I had no experience with neural networks or machine learning. I worked through the MATLAB examples to find the best machine learning functions for generating virtual metrology. I couldn’t have done this in C or Python—it would’ve taken too long to find, validate, and integrate the right packages.” This is exactly the sort of comment I would expect from someone who shouldn’t be doing machine learning. None of the big tech companies are using matlab. Sure you can find me an engineering firm that is using it but those companies aren’t exactly known for their programming acumen
Using OOP isn’t just “habit” holy shit. It’s how serious development is done right. If you’re just writing scripts all day, it makes for an exceedingly brittle codebase that is impossible to understand or modify. I’ve used matlab for years but I switched to python and my programming ability has grown exponentially
Err no, maybe I've explained myself poorly. I know that Python is not generic. I have used Python extensively and I really like it. I'm just saying that the syntax is (IMO) shit compared to many other languages.
I can assure you that MATLAB is still a major tool at big 4 companies that do Computer Vision work for prototyping. I’m happy for data science people like you that love Python. I like Python too. Doesn’t mean you can speak for trends of “serious software development” as a whole based on your own personal experience.
There are many other paradigms such as functional programming which may be better for specific applications than the state transitions that arise from OOP. There is a pretty big chasm between your false choice between OOP vs “writing scripts all day”.
Wow these goalpost are moving fast. Also I kind of see some sort of circular logic here (maybe I'm wrong), but I have the feeling that you would classify anyone using Matlab for ML as "someone who shouldn't be doing machine learning", just like you did here. If that's the case, then yes, it's impossible for me to show you a successful example, as any such example would be rejected. But here we have someone with no prior experience in ML, that use matlab, and is successful at doing ML. Seems that for his case, that may have been one good tool. Sure, he is not a researcher at the forefront of ML or DL (and matlab is not for people there, I can definitively agree with that), but that seems to show that you can definitively use it for engineering applications. (fun fact, engineer is mainly what mathworks is targeting)
Yes I think you did. This is a separate argument, base language choices which you consider stupid are not really anything to do with a ‘confusing syntax, 
My University went from user licensing to a site wide license. It saved us a lot of money on the whole plus made it easier for renewals (once a year instead of each group/user doing renews and package management). We basically get all the toolboxes and support we need. Many professors prefer to use this and we do a lot of heavy development with it in my civil department. The hardware support for both Matlab and Simulink is unrivaled. 
What do you mean Matlab has only one function per file? You mean defining multiple functions in a script? Because that's easy... You just... Define them.
Sorry I meant more than one externally accessible file
Syntax is a base language choice.
Ok you’re confused no problem.
I didn't say OOP was a habit. If you're just looking to argue, there are better subs for it. 
To be fair this is a real limitation of Matlab. There can only be one externally accessible function per file. Local functions are fine, but serve a different role. In most other languages, you can write a whole library of functions in a single file and call them from another. It's really quite odd that this isn't possible in Matlab. That said, it's nothing more than an annoyance really. It doesn't impede anything besides organization, which can be done in other ways. Especially now that you can make your own modules and packages. 
I figured it out. Thank you.
I’d suggest that being actually decent at Data Science is fundamentally about mathematics and statistics insight. And programming ability, agnostic to a language and hopefully shaped by having used several languages and understanding their place as tools on the shelf.
I’d suggest it’s actually about understanding the field and being able to implement ideas given a tool set.
You literally restated what I said.
You're welcome!
You didn't make a function called f or a function called df. You made a function called FC2N. 
True. This is why I use Octave. For fairly basic linear algebra or automation to voltage to resistance conversions for 20x10^6 data points, it’s not *that* different of an experience than Matlab. With that being said, the refinement, stability, and efficiency of Matlab cannot overstated. Realistically, if I was using Octave on a daily basis, convincing my company to buy a license of Matlab would take all of ten minutes, just by running a Matlab script next to an identical Octave script for the aforementioned 20 million data points (the script did a bit more than just voltage to resistance), in which Matlab would be done generating 20ish plots, whole Octave wouldn’t be don’t with the raw calculations.
That is quite a broad generalization and it will further depend on the industry.
I like octave on my personal projects, because it's mostly compatible with Matlab and it's free. The big "buts" though: it lacks HPC features, it's a bit slower in general, and support on Mac is iffy. Also, the GUI is far behind Matlab.
Object oriented code exists in Matlab, and is likely to become more common over time. Like it or not (I don't, personally) this is a programming aspect that you're going to have to get familiar with, eventually.
