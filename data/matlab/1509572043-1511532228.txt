Which dimension do you want to calculate the shifted correlations on? Because, I suspect you may want to transpose your matrix first, taking correlations along the 16384 values, rather than across the 10. Also, you may want to look into setting maxlag as well, if you think your periodicity may be relatively short compared to the full length.
we can't give any guidance if we don't know what your code looks like so far. the documentation for [fft is very thorough](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fft.html) on how to use it and that forum post from my initial comment shows an implementation. if csvread works in the workspace but not the script then you have something else going on
I have *occasionally* had weird bugs like this with data in "single" format. If your data is single, you could try converting to double.
Have you looked at [is](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/is.html) variants for type tests? You could check if it is a string with *isstring* or *ischar*, or make sure it is numeric with *isnumeric*, *isfloat/isint*. 
I hope this doesn’t sound too harsh but how do you not know that if you are in some sort of class that presumably teaches you these things if they are giving you matlab homework. Defining a Matrix is basically the most fundamental thing you can do in matlab. Any tutorial should cover this. This sub is usually pretty friendly with homework help as long as you can show that you put some work in and have specific questions on some aspect of the code. Basically show what you have tried so far.
Nah I understand you, this is all really new to me and the lectures haven't been too helpful so I'm self teaching myself a lot of it so most of the time I don't know if my code is good or not
Thank you so much. That really helped. He did want it numerically for a few values as well as an algebraic solution. He's given us extra time on it so I'll use your links and get through it tonight. Thanks again!
I got isnan to work by doing this If isnan (a | b | c | d)==0 *Execute rest of script pretty much* Else Msgbox('enter numerical values only') End Thanks for the help. 
 Z(Z&gt;h) = h;
my biggest suggestion would be to get rid of the "rng('shuffle')" and set it to a constant seed, then store some info within your loops to track where stuff starts to blow up. It's a HUGE pain in the ass to debug when you have different random numbers since the randomness can influence where the bug starts to manifest itself. Other than that, step through your code either line-by-line or using breakpoints to make sure it's doing exactly what you want it to do.
First thing I noticed was that your Runge Kutta implemention that you posted on that link is not the same as what you wrote in your explanation. The argument f should be the name of the function that describes your differential equations. The contents of your RK4 code are right in your explanation, you just need to properly define f. 
That is a great suggestion, thanks! And you're right, it is indeed a huge pain in the ass. I'm going to bypass the whole random thing with a fixed speed and work my way in.
In general, trying to make one language behave like another language is a bad idea. This is horrible ugly Matlab code. Just learn to use the tools you're using instead of trying to make a hammer into a wrench. 
try **adding** noise: v = v + (randn - 0.5) ;
What do you mean by "it doesn't do anything"? Your code obviously does something. What about what it does is not what you like?
Sorry I mean v is not being re-assigned as I am expecting it to when it exceeds the limit
My bad, first * was meant to be a +. Either way the velocity ends up being anywhere from -0.7 to 15 after 150 iterations.
First of all, you should understand that if there is a hard upper or lower bound, the noise is no longer Gaussian. If you wanted to be technical it's probably a truncated normal distribution. Second, when you say "nothing happens" it's very vague. Something definitely happens, it's just not what you're expecting. Try using the debugger to step through the code and see what goes wrong. 
He is adding a normally distributed random value with std dev of 0.5 and zero mean. You are adding a normally distributed random value with std dev of 1 and mean of -0.5.
Oh, I bet v is a vector. You're treating it like a scalar. 
Well the code you showed will def work. So it must be in the code you're not showing us. A guess: is v a vector? If so, your if statement will not work that way. If v is a vector, look up logical indexing to find a quick way to do what you're trying to do. 
Yes I understand that. The instruction I was given is that the velocity should always be in the range of -0.5 to 0.5 and that gaussian noise should be added to it in each iteration of the particle filter to maintain diversity in the particles. 
v is just a 1x1 double
Oh, never mind then. 
I rewrote the if statements and now it works, which is odd because there was no syntax error before. Cheers for helping out anyway.
I tried re writing the if statements and it works. Thanks for input anyway
Is there a question somewhere?
You found a complete Matlab implementation of the algorithm, post it, and then ask how to do it in Matlab?
gosh that's stupid of me, I fixed it
Sixth degree polynomial, so there are up to six values. But the highest exponent is even, so there also could be no values. Consider that, instead of solving: 5 = a*x^6 + b*x^5 + ... + constant; You could solve: 0 = a*x^6 + b*x^5 + ... + (constant - 5); Then you're finding the roots, which is a problem that Matlab can solve a bunch of different ways.
ya but i am having problems with the code, thats why i was asking here. Unable to understand how to run the thing cause some of the stuff is not defined i guess. Like the conditionLines() thing.
You don't need to plot a line through x and y for all the values of theta. Matlab "connects the dots" automatically when you plot. If you want the figure to be closed, then just append a zero to your definition of theta: dTheta = 1; % degree theta = 0:dTheta:360; % degrees theta = [theta, 0]; theta = (pi/180)*theta; r = % function of theta; x = r.*cos(theta); y = r.*sin(theta); plot(x, y); If you change dTheta, the angular resolution between points in theta, then your plot gets more or less "jagged." Try dTheta of 0.1 degree, 1 degree, and 10 degrees. You'll see what I mean. In the future, if you *don't* want Matlab to connect the dots, you need to specify a *marker*: plotMarker = '.'; plot(x, y, plotMarker); Markers that I normally use are `'o'`, `'x'`, `'+'`, `'--'`, `'-.'`, and `'.'`.
Warning: I've changed my comment based on FrickinLazerBeams comment
There's nothing I saw in the algorithm that would prohibit vertical or horizontal lines, and the `conditionlines()` function doesn't return anything. There is a comment above the function calls, though, that says, `% Make sure there are no horizontal or vertical lines`. My *guess* would be that it should error if it detects horizontal or vertical lines because, again, the functions don't *output* anything. That's easy to do - function conditionlines(inputVar) if size(inputVar,1) &gt; size(inputVar,2) inputVar = inputVar.'; end if (sum(abs(diff(inputVar(:,1)))) &gt;0) || (sum(abs(diff(inputVar(:,2)))) &gt; 0) error('conditionlines - inputVar is horizontal or vertical line.'); end end Your question isn't clear on what you're having trouble with. You say, &gt; i dont get how to run this program. Like what should i take as input and all. The function definition is clear: &gt; function morphed = bnmorph( im, inputLines, targetLines ) An image, how the image is currently oriented, and how you want the image to be transformed. 
new to matlab so i apologise but its still not working, like can you give an example. Since whatever i put in place of inpulines and tragetlines i get Index exceeds matrix dimensions error.
Your input lines look like the should be of size `[nPoints, 2]`. I don't know if that's what you've provided or not - *You haven't posted anywhere how you're calling the function, what your inputs are, what your image is, etc.* Where is the error? The error will give you a line number. You didn't paste the error. 
image is just random titled square. to run it im doing, gnmorph('imagefile.png',inputline,targetline) here i tried diff values for inputline and targetline but i guess inputline has to be something diff. cant really say about error since i have been doing the input wrong, ssry. So i know that targetlines has to be an int right, but what to input for inputlines, since using int there gives me: Index exceeds matrix dimensions. Error in test_img/conditionlines (line 13) if (sum(abs(diff(inputVar(:,1)))) &gt;0) || (sum(abs(diff(inputVar(:,2)))) &gt; 0) Error in test_img (line 19) conditionlines(inputLines);
Of course it's possible. Have you contacted the developers? Are the developers even active anymore? Could anything have gotten overwritten in the new Matlab install? Have you done any amount of debugging at all?????
You need to read the code and think critically about what it's doing. I can't (won't) walk through all the problems you're having or are going to have, but I'll help with with this one by explaining how I would figure out what's going on. **Problem:** You don't know what to use for `inputLines`. **Problem-solving steps:** 1. Look where `inputLines` is used. - a. `Pisource = inputLines(i1,:);` 2. What is `i1`? Why would that matter? - a. `i1` is a function of `i`: `i1 = (i-1)*2 + 1;` 3. What is `i`? How is it defined? - a. `for i = 1:numLineSegments` 4. What is `numLineSegments`? - a. `numLineSegments = int32(numPoints/2);` 5. What is `numPoints`? - a. `[numPoints,~] = size(targetLines);` Okay, now we've walked all the way back to an input. Now we can "step forward" from here: 1. `numPoints` is the number of *rows* in `targetLines`, because the `size()` command returns `[nRows, nCols]`. - a. This implies, then, that `targetLines` is a matrix of points, where each point is represented by a *row* in `targetLines`. 2. `numLineSegments` is half the number of rows in `targetLines`. - a. This implies that `targetLines` should have an *even* number of rows and, based on the (descriptive!) variable name, there are two entries that define a line segment. 3. The code loops for the number of line segments and selects indices from `targetLines` and `inputLines`. 4. The code selected row indices for line segments: - a. `i1` is calculated to be odd numbers from 1 to `2*numLineSegments-1`. - b. `i2` is calculated to be `i1 + 1`, which would be all positive numbers from 2 to `2*numLineSegments`. 5. A line/ray is usually defined as `endPoint - startPoint`, so you can see that `QPi = Qi - Pi` generates a line defined by an origin at `Pi = targetLines(i1, :);` and an end point at `Qi = targetLines(i2, :);`. 6. You can see that `QPisource` is defined the same way as `QPi`, but using `inputLines` instead of `targetLines`. So, by looking through the code where the inputs are used, you can see what they're doing and how they relate to the rest of the code. Explicitly, to answer your question, it looks like you need to define: inputLines(1,1) = inputStartingX; inputLines(1,2) = inputStartingY; inputLines(2,1) = inputEndingX; inputLines(2,2) = inputEndingY; and targetLines(1,1) = targetStartingX; targetLines(1,2) = targetStartingY; targetLines(2,1) = targetEndingX; targetLines(2,2) = targetEndingY; The only other thing that looks like it's holding you back might be `perp()`, but that's defined in the function comments. Don't forget also that the code in the question statement is broken; the OP posted the fix in the answer. Also in the answer, OP mentions adding "A horizontal [line] spanning the image like the vertical one," which may imply that the `conditionlines()` function doesn't stop the program or were disabled. If you want to rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise, try: inputLines = [0,0; 0,1]; targetLines = [0,0; 1,0]; And finally, note that `targetLines` and `inputLines` are both indexed the same, but there's no explicit check that they're the same size. If `inputLines` has fewer rows than `targetLines` then you'll get an error. 
ok ssry for not putting edit but i had managed to fix the problem :) thanks for all the help though.
Are you typing "GUIDE" or "guide"? Only the latter one will work. What version of Matlab are you using, and what OS? Is there any error message? Does Matlab stay busy after executing the command? If so, how long have you waited?
Thanks for the response. 'guide' in lower case. Matlab R2017b, Windows 10. No error message. Busy does not even show, in the way that it does when I type appdesigner.
Had a try and got this, is it correct? https://imgur.com/vxeAjc1
Almost! Your aVec and bVec are correct, but your cVec needs some work. If you read the help file, it tells you that logspace(x1,x2,n) creates a vector of length n between points 10^x1 and 10^x2. Your code so far calls for 10 points between 10^0 and 10^1, but the problem is asking for something else. 
Thanks :) andwould it be 1 and 10 then instead of 0 and 1?
Oh is it asking for lots and lots of values between 10^0 and 10^1??
Sorry I took so long to get back to you on this, but you totally saved my bacon. The script worked almost perfectly. There were a couple cells that were corrupted, but the bulk was recovered. I don't really have another way to show my appreciation, and I felt that simply saying thank you didn't make up for the amount of work you did, and the help you offered. So have a month of gold on me, and thanks again for your help.
Wow popped my golden cherry! Thanks! Really glad to have helped, too &lt;3 Thanks again!
Yeah, those would be your bounds, and then you would look at the exponents they want and figure out the pattern that you'd have to pick your n to satisfy.
If you type: which guide what do you get in return?
C:\Users\[me]\Documents\MATLAB\guide.m
Well there's your problem, that script is shadowing the proper guide file. Go in that folder, and rename or delete that guide.m file. That should solve your issue.
Ah, wonderful diagnosis, thank you a lot :)
Here's a lazy way for those of us that refuse to check the manual: index = 0:0.01:1; tens = 10*ones(1,length(index)); cVec = tens.^index; Another possibility: j = 1; for i = 0:0.01:1 cVec(1,j) = 10^i; j = j+1; end Probably not what your professor is asking for though...
the loop seems to be working for me, but i would say that going through the whole sorted_matrix is wasteful. Instead, pull out the unique values of sorted_matrix, and loop over that instead (use the "unique" function). The homework assignment is to probably provide some code to do this, but there's nothing holding you back from comparing your results with Matlab's built in functions. 
&gt; array indexing for grabbing pieces of a string +_Sayeth_ I tried to look it up and I couldn't find anything useful and the only times I've made it actually make a sound of multiple tones was when I set str2num and lab8 to variable i which doesn't make any sense 
Yes, [this](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_plots/how-surface-plot-data-relates-to-a-colormap.html) is definitely possible.
I would make it into a function similar to the following: function displacement = forced(F0, w, w0) That way you can write a for loop around this function for the different w0 values and plot them all in a single figure using "hold on". 
For this assignment, you could simply have t defined within the function itself, but if this was going to be used in other assignments you could include that as an input.
thanks Matt, worked like a charm! So when a question asks for defined values in a function like that does it mean inputs?
If you just need to import it one time, you can use the Import Wizard, just open it in the File Explorer in MATLAB. If you need a code version of it, you can create a function from the import wizard of what you want to import. If you want to code it yourself you can use [textscan](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/textscan.html) or [fscanf](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fscanf.html) You can also take a look at this topic as well talking about [Importing a Non Rectangular Text File](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/import_export/import-data-from-a-nonrectangular-text-file.html) 
honestly, i'm not sure. you really only have two options: have the variable as an input, or have it defined within the function itself. might be worth an email to your TA/professor to clarify, but i'd be willing to bet they'd be happy with treating them as inputs since it makes your code more flexible for use in the future.
[dlmread](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/dlmread.html)
Not sure if I fully understand what you are trying to do based on the description, but you can use "varargin" to handle a variable number of inputs. mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/varargin.html
So I want it to be so that a user could enter [a1 +a2 , a1-a2; a1*a2, a1/a2] and [1;2] or they could enter [a1 +a2 + a3 , a1-a2-a3; a1a2a3, a1/a2/a3] and [1;2;3] and both would produce a matrix of solutions ie [3,-1;2;.5] and [6,-4; 6, 1/6] From what I understand (and this is very little so if I'm wrong here my bad) varargin makes it so that one function applies to several different inputs and produces as many results? Which isn't exactly what I'm trying to do here. 
 f = {@plus, @minus; @times, @rdivide}; x = {1, 2}; y = cellfun(@(f) f(x{:}), f);
Thank you so much for this. In between computers atm so can't test. Can you explain what {:} does exactly? 
after the loop, the iterator i will retain its last value, which in this case is 25. Table uses columnar cell arrays as inputs to define different entries when you use the table command. This probably does what you want: table(num2cell(1:25)',num2cell(f)')
It's always bothered me that Matlab makes row vectors by default, but that's what it does. A couple problems - 1. When you make your table, you're only giving it two values, which is why you're only getting two values out. You give `i`, which is equal to 25 (from the end of the loop), and `f(i)`, which is equal to 1.2139e+05. If you want more values, you need to pass more values to `table()`. 2. If you want a row in your `table` for each entry in `f`, then you need to tranpose `f` such that it is a column vector. You'll need to do the same for `1:i`, too.
That did it! Thanks! I tried num2cell earlier but I was doing it earlier in the code, not in the table itself. That makes sense though.
This makes sense. I had a feeling it was only reading the two values but wasn't sure. Thanks for the info!
Can confirm - code looks okay to me, so I tried it and it seems to work fine. &gt; Everything in the code above is acceptable except for the sum function. This is the problem with your question - *what's wrong with the sum function?* &gt; I have been trying to use loops and what not but it doesn't come out with the right answer half the time or just doesn't run completely. What are your inputs and what is the output you are getting? If you don't give us the scenario that breaks your code, then we're stuck guessing at what's wrong with it. When I try: sorted_matrix = floor(100*rand(100,1)); count = 0; m = 0; for ii = 1:length(sorted_matrix) if count &lt; sum(sorted_matrix(ii) == sorted_matrix) m = sorted_matrix(ii); count = sum(sorted_matrix(ii) == sorted_matrix); end end I get the right answer every time, so again I'm not sure what you're expecting or what you're providing to the function, what your error is, or why you're thinking the problem lies with `sum()`. 
I realize I'm a bit late to this, but I use the [68-95-99 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule) when I generate noise that I want to be within some band. You want a mean of zero and a max value of 0.5: noiseMean = 0; noisePk = 0.5; noiseStd = noisePk/3; v = v + noiseStd*randn; You set `noiseStd`, the standard deviation of your noise, to be 1/3 of your peak noise value. Now, following the rule, 99.7% of all noisy samples should fall within +/- 3 standard deviations, which means that 99.7% of all noisy samples should be +/- 0.5. 
I don't think it needs to be a cell array, though, FYI. `table(1:25.', f.')` worked fine for me. 
You're right about the cell things, your code could use some brackets though. I don't like tables anyways... table((1:25).', f.') 
I think it helps to formulate the math first. The first questions require you to come up with equations for the position and velocity of the point. That has very little to do with matlab. So work on that first and once you get to the matlab part and get stuck there you can ask some specific questions. BTW: If this is the whole question and there are no external fields like gravity, this will be a very boring result with those initial conditions
Very boring indeed... 
So I don't think this works? Doesn't this assume that there are 2 a's? 
Ah shit yeah. Made the same mistake when I did it in Matlab the first time, then typed from memory here instead of copy/paste. 
Matlab is built for vectorization. Any time you find yourself operating on individual elements of a matrix one at a time, take a second to reflect on your method. In this case, you want to create a logical index by saving the result of some logical test or comparison to a new variable. For example, x = [1 2 3 4]; ix = x &lt; 3; % ix is now [1 1 0 0]
I would start by looking at the community for NIH image/ ImageJ. This has been the software of choice in R&amp;D labs for ages, and as such, there is a large body of scripts for image analysis— scripts that could easily be converted into m code.
Your code hurst my eyes. I'm going to tell you some stuff you can use to solve your problem. Results of logical operations are variables too logicalVariable= a/2 == a .* 0.5 most matlab functions work arrays too: A = [1 2 3 4]; modOfA= mod(A,3) you can combine these things too to get an array of logicals: thisEntryToAis3 = A == 3 and for the love of god, [format if else statements like a sane person](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/if.html#bt7zdb5-4), and don't put the else clause PARTIALY on the same line as the else keyword.
You have `== 0.7`. That means it only triggers if the signal is equal to `0.7000000000000000` etc. If your value is off by a ten-billionth, then it's not *exactly* equal. I'm not sure why you're toggling which wave you're looking at, but that might be an issue, too. If, for example, one wave were at a value of 1 when the other wave was passing 0.7, then you'd miss the trigger. If you're looking to get the first moment after the wave passes 0.7, try replacing the `== 0.7` block with a `&gt;= 0.7` block, and then putting a `Logic and Bit Operations` --&gt; `Detect Increase` block after it. This would trigger the first time the `&gt;=0.7` block fired and would then output zero for all instances after it.
Image toolbox, instrument control toolbox if you need to control some shit.
Holy crap that formatting gave me cancer. As stated in the documentation, an if statement works on a scalar, not a vector. I'm not sure how this algorithm works, mathematically. Do you know know what condition is satisfied by whole numbers? 
sorry to bother you again mate, i set f0 as a constant and it turns out that wasn't correct. Do you how to calculate f0?
No. For any arrays of functions f and inputs x, the third line will evaluate each function with the inputs and return an array with the same shape as the function array. Just make sure that f and x are the right type (cell array v function returning an array for f and cell array v regular array for x, depending on which alternative you use). Although I've provided examples that use two inputs, it could be any number. The # of inputs needs to be consistent, but that is the user's responsibility. 
 sin(R)./R;
This worked, thank you! 
Since it's just space delimited text, you can just use the load function. i.e. A = load('nodes.txt'); 
You forgot to ask a question.
solve pls
Reddit pls
according to that problem, F0 is the amplitude of the forcing function. Is that changing with time, or a constant value? If it is a function itself, you can write another Matlab file or have it calculated in the forced.m.
Competent computer programmers, particularly with an additional background in numerical analysis, expect to be paid 6 figures plus benefits. 
+1, If you are not willing to pay that much (which is the *average* for anyone decent) then don't really bother...
Try finding someone on a freelance site
If this is going to be part time work for the programmer, I would contact the CS departments of any neighbor colleges/universities. Undergrads are always looking for experience
Line 9, you should actually call your nested function to get a value for Df. h=-f(x)/Df; replace by: h=-f(x)/diffkvot(f,x);
Of course, can't believe I missed that. Will try it out, thanks!
Thanks. I haven’t used matlab before and the tut on YouTube doesn’t really help for me somehow...
The asterisks (*) is used to indicate matrix multiplication. So if A is a 3x3 matrix and b a 3x1 vector: A*b Will return a 3x1 vector in the traditional linear algebra sense. Is B a matrix of numbers or is it a symbolic matrix?
There's one called AMATH 301 I believe. They're not really MATLAB tutorials, but rather lectures on different topics in maths and physics, but during each of the lectures the guy writes up a program to implement the theory covered. I've watched a number of them. As a beginner it really helped me get more comfortable with MATLAB
Still says "undefined function diffkvot" instead :/
Nevermind, messed up with a capital letter. Seems to work now!
I’m in the wrong job. 
B is a Nx3 matrix. I've tried using the Jacobian function, but kept getting errors in regards to it being symbolic. My problem lies in writing the equations properly since (B * nabla)|B| should end out as a scalar (so a vector of scalars in this case). But nabla, as a gradient needs an input in matlab so writing vecNorm(B).*gradient(B,[x,y,z],2) would end out in an Nx3 matrix so in this sense it should be a dot product ?
I would be very interested in this if you happen to be in the Baltimore area. 
Perhaps i should have specificed that i meant more in the ballpark of freelance work instead of a position. 
Any specific sites you have in mind?
NYC, sadly.
Good idea. Thanks for the input!
Just out of curiosity, what kind of lab do you work in? academia? 
Yea, I'm a graduate student
 tic and toc should help you along the way.
Me too, What field?
Visual Neuroscience lol
6 figure divided by 52 plus a premium for on-demand labor would probably be in the right ballpark. Around $50 per hour.
Does it have to be matlab?
And you can pay them much less
Replace your colons with commas. What you have written will extract the 5th through to 6th through to 9th elements of A and assign them to the variable B. Look at MATLAB documentation for matrix indexing. 
Well, I don't want to give too much away if this is homework, but Matlab does have a sign() function...
That’s all I need, thank you so much! 
I'd be interested if it's remote work!
&gt; It seems matlab does not have a way of multiplying a vector with a matrix, from what i've been able to read from the documentation. What? If I had to pick the most fundamental thing that Matlab does, it's matrix and vector math. &gt; vecNorm is a function i made that looks like Why did you call it vecNorm? Did you realize there is a *built-in function* called norm?
What’s wrong with this logical statement? If sign(x_r) = sign(x_l);
To test for equality, use two equal signs: If sign(x_r) == sign(x_l);
It's a good suggestion! I've made solid money doing contract MATLAB cleaning up for grad students.
What's the project? I'll give you a bid. Though honestly I like to start doing the job first, for free, to get a feel for it, then I give the client a quote. Seems more fair that way, for both me and them.
Yes, we do, but sometimes we just like the problem/work.
no problem. I’m actually doing this exact thing for one of the research labs at my university. Writing matlab code for one of their projects l
ode45 requires a function with two inputs not three. You can use anonymous functions to set the value of const immediately before calling ode45.
Then how is my f1 version working by itself? I can run ode45 with 3 parameters just fine on f1. 
The [documentation](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ode45.html#inputarg_odefun) defines odefun with two inputs. The ode45.m code itself evaluates odefun(t,y). Is there a different version of f1 that ode45 might be calling?
You have a few mistakes. First, when you're calculating the difference between an approximated and actual result, you don't necessarily know which will be larger so you could get either a positive or negative number. But only the magnitude of that number matters. So you should take the absolute value of the difference calculation. Second, you want the loop to run while the error ( the difference) is greater than your tolerance for error. You have your inequality facing the wrong direction - you're telling your loop to run while the error is less than the tolerance. If you deal with those two issues, your code should run. But you'll get the wrong answer. The question is asking you to approximate e until |e_{approx}-e| &lt; 0.0002. But what you're checking is 1/e_{approx}-1/e. In both cases the error decreases as n increases, but not at the same speed. If you use your method you'll get the wrong value for n. 
I've found out that doing matrix multiplication on matlab2016a gives a matrix multiplication error when trying it on Nx1 * Nx3 however when i do it on my stationary that runs 2016b it's not a problem. the function norm gives the norm of the matrix, but not the norm of the row-wise elements in that matrix, my function does that. I think my problem was 2016a, since 2016b doesn't give the same errors when doing vector and matrix operations
I would have thought that's a *Windows* setting, not a Matlab setting. 
it doesn't use it as the default device despite it being so in windows.
Really? Dude same here but we write all our codes ourselves. Including preprocessing. Come on. It's a good learning experience because analysis is exploration. You should do it yourself.
Don't worry, as soon as you said "lab" literally no one expected you to offer a reasonable salary. 
Ol' debian420 rather do the work for free. Why academia is fucked. 
You also can just disable the other input devices in windows... Google says that by default, Matlab should be selecting your default audio input device from Windows. Otherwise, Google also says that psychtoolbox allows selection of audio devices.
Do you have the link for the google's wisdom about audio device selection with psychtoolbox? 
are you suggesting my while loop to be while abs(exp(1) - (1-(1/n))^(-n)) &gt; 0.002 n = n + 1;
Show us your code. We can't help you without seeing your code
 function res = Trisection(f,a0,b0,err,Maxn,info) N = 20; for n = 0:N xn = (an+bn)/2 c1 = an+(bn-an)/3; c2 = an+2*(bn-an)/3; if (f(an)*f(c1) &lt; 0) an+1 = an; bn+1 = c1; else an+1 = c2; bn+1 = bn; end end res = cn; end
Also not sure how to define variables as MATLAB is saying they must be within the function?
You use inputs titled a0 and b0, but in your loop you are using an and bn, which haven't been defined anywhere. Before your loop, you can set an = a0 and bn=b0
Also, your an+1 =c2 and similar lines don't make sense in Matlab. If you want to store those values so that you have all of them, put it in a vector doing where the index is getting incremented up
So, you're handing in variables `a0` and `b0`but you're not using them. You're suddenly using variables `an` and `bn` though. However, the way you write `an + 1 = an` and `bn + 1 = c1` makes me think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of how to index variables. If you want a variable, `a` to be a vector (that is, have values for 1 through n) you need to index it with a counter variable. So you'd say `a(n + 1) = c1` for instance, since `n` is your counter. 
What an+1 means is the next iteration of an if that makes sense
I know what you're trying to do, and I'm showing you the correct way of doing it. 
That's the issue I'm currently having, I have changed my code but I'm not sure how to index the variables
 function res = Trisection(f,a0,b0,err,Maxn,info) Maxn = 100; a0 = 0; b0 = 1; err = 10^-9; an = a0; bn = b0; for n = 0:Maxn c = an+(bn-an)/3; d = an + 2*(bn-an)/3; if (f(an)*f(c) &lt; 0) an+1 = an; bn+1 = c; elseif f(an)*f(d) &lt; 0 an+1 = c; bn+1 = d; else an+1 = d; bn+1 = bn end end res = c; end I have changed my code slightly, but I still don't understand how I would index the variables an+1 and bn+1.. I am pretty much trying to put this into MATLAB - https://gyazo.com/30d6ac6f7caea0557675fe88480390d8

So, write a little script that just does this, to see what I mean: a(1) = 1; for n = 1:5 a(n + 1) = 2*a(n); end This isn't your code, exactly, but it showcases what I mean. You are defining the "n'th plus 1" element, inside a for-loop. That's how you index variables in MATLAB. Also, the top of your code is wrong. Inputs to your function are defined outside of the function, and then handed into the function. There is no point is making those variables inputs, if you're just going to overwrite them right away. 
1. Your code isn’t formatted correctly 2. clearvars tbh
1. This is a command, not code 2. This is a shit post
I mean you need to use four spaces % to post code 
If I try to define variables outside of the function, I get an error saying this statement is not inside any function
In your previous version of your code you never defined an or bn, just a0 and b0. Then in your new code, you define everything inside. What you want to do is hand in a0 and b0, then define an and bn inside
Yes. But I think your question had a tolerance of 0.0002, not 0.002. Did this work?
my full new code: n=0; diff = abs((1-(1/n))^(-n) - exp(-1)); while diff &gt; 0.002 n = n +1; end when I run it, it won't stop running and when I stop it, my n is usually enormous
That's because you aren't modifying the value of diff. You recalculate n but you don't recalculate diff so diff will always be over 0.0002 n=0; diff = abs((1-(1/n))^(-n) - exp(-1)); while diff &gt; 0.0002 n = n +1; diff = abs((1-(1/n))^(-n) - exp(-1)); end THAT WILL ALSO NOT WORK. Since that's not the mathematical definition of e. it's 1+1/n not 1-1/n so while diff &gt; 0.0002 n = n +1; diff = abs((1+(1/n))^(-n) - exp(-1)); end will get you a n of 920
I thought that by putting diff on the while line, it would modify it as it went through the loops and I'm put sure we have to approximate e^-1 hence the 1-1/n my new code: n=0; diff = 1; while diff &gt; 0.0002 n = n +1; diff = abs((1-(1/n))^(n) - exp(-1)); end and I get n = 921
Can you manually move the figure there and read what the position is?
There is a lot wrong here, so I will start with a few that jump out. Look up how functions are defined in the documentation. Usually, this code is saved in an .m file in the Matlab Path, and then is called from either the command line or another .m file like the built-in functions. If you are just trying to run this in the command line or as an .m file, then drop the function part and use it as a script. If you make a function, the the inputs are things that are unknown until you call the function. It look me like you built a function with a few unknowns - to be passed to the function at calling time - but then define them again within the function. Either define them in the function OR pass them to the function. N=length(10).... try this on the command line. Basically, you are defining N to be the length of the integer ‘10’, which I think will give you 1. You should either set N=10 if it will always be this length, or N=length(some array) if it will vary. Length will tell you how many numbers are in an array. Hope this gives you a start!
Hey, thanks so much for the help! I changed my code up a bit but i'm still having some difficulty. This is what it's at currently: P = [0 0 1 0 0 0; 1/2 0 0 0 0 0; 0 1/2 0 1 0 0; 1/2 1/2 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 1; 0 0 0 0 1 0]; beta = 0.15; u0 = [1/6; 1/6; 1/6; 1/6; 1/6; 1/6;]; N=10; a=(1-beta)*P; b= beta*u0; N=10; u=zeros(size(N)); u(1)=[0.1667;0.0958;0.2375;0.1667;0.1667;0.1667]; for k = 2:N u(k) = a * u(k-1) + b; end What I know is wrong is that the function u is not defined, so it can't register what u(1) is or what u(k) is. How do I go about defining my u function? Setting it to zeros of size N doesn't work. I've set it as the a 1x6 matrix composing of either 0's or 1's, but nothing seems to be working.
Are there constraints on the type of function that f can be? If none, then there are an infinite number of solutions because a finite number of data points is not sufficient to determine a unique function in the space of all possible functions... if the constraint is that the functions must be quadratic, then you might be able to proceed. I think the questions need to be more clearly written. For example, the data points you gave - are they of the form (x, y), and if so, the fact that you mention that x and y are both n-vectors is confusing because n=1.
Yeah, sorry that it's unclear. The constraint is that it must be quadratic. For example, say we have f(x)=-x2/6+bx+2 and we are given the three points that lie on the line: (0,2), (2,5), (3,6). How can I determine the value of b?
Do you know how to put a *stop* in a .m file? I would advance your code line-by-line, and check that the variables are the size you expect. For example, you set u=zeros(size(N)), so zeros(1), instead of zeros(10). It is usually a pain when you try to dynamically assign elements such as u(k)=u(k-1). When you assign multiple variables, it is usually safer to use u(k,:) - or u(:,k). The ‘:’ operator means ‘All’, so you are saying ‘set all values in the k-th row/column to this list of numbers’. The best approach is to advance code line-by-line to check that the variables you are assigning make sense. Then you can determine where the errors occur and, hopefully, why they occur. This looks a lot closer to working than your original function!
Nice comparison! If you haven’t tried the Matlab profiler, it can really help to speed up complex bits of code. I have even had the profiler ‘step in’ to a C+ mex function and make recommendations that reduced the execution time of a function from 0.05s to .0001s. Doesn’t sound like much, but the function was being called thousands of times, and the difference was startling.
Is any of this new information?
Dude you have no idea what you’re doing 
Can you use mp = get(0, ‘monitorpositions’) to find the position of the monitors and then set the figure position based on this? If you have 2 monitors connected then mp should have 2 rows. 
The problem is still ill-defined. f(x) may be an arbitrary quadratic but can you write down exactly how it depends on b? Thx.
You probably mean multiple processes instead of multithreading. Matlab runs its backends multithreaded by default. What you are doing here is to start up multiple single threaded matlab processes. To gain access to the multithreading you would need to vectorize your loop. That would also increase performance on the GPU as matlab can’t translate the loop like you have there properly. Supposedly the newer Matlab versions improve on the abysmal loop performance but the proper multithreaded vectorized approach should blow your parallel loop out of the water, especially if you include the setup time for the parallel pool in the duration. Having a parallel pool active might force matlab backend to single threaded so check for that if you are testing the vectorized variant. Of course in the wild you might have something in your loop that is awkward to vectorize and you just chose this as an example but as this stands it’s not really something you would do like this in matlab. In languages like Julia the loops would be the preferred method as you avoid temporary arrays and Julia has fast loops.
Depending on how `Efficiency` was generated, you may need to plot `[Y, X] = meshgrid(B, A)`, or plot the transpose of `Efficiency` (`Efficiency'`)
It has to do with the way matlab displays these grids. Internally a matrix is indexed from the top left corner in a column row order approach. That means if you walk along the first dimension of the matrix you walk downwards from the top left. This clashes with the plotting convention that the first dimension in a xy plot is in the left-right direction. With meshgrid matlab will do some trickery to reconcile that. If you generate a meshgrid it will actually have its first two dimensions swapped. For example if you form a 4d meshgrid its size won’t be [Nx,Ny,Nz,Nt] but [Ny,Nx,Nz,Nt]. So it’s strange that didn’t help you. 
Additionally a tip: Matlab stores it’s matrices in column major format so you should construct your loops so that the first dimension is the inner loop. That way you avoid unnecessary jumps in memory locations.
Wait can you elaborate? Why is my Y being switched with my X in only the surface plot? Is it going through an entire row and then going one column down and going through the next row, or is it going through an entire column and then going one row down and going through the next column?
Also why TF does meshgrid do that and why is there indication that that happens in the Matlab documentation for surf()?
Don't you just call `fit(x, y, 'Fourier5')`? Or is this a home brew solution? If the former, just change y to whatever you want. If the latter, post the method you're trying to implement and your version that's broken. 
Yes. That's how I determined that I wanted the default position to be [-1267 44 1256 872] 
I can. mp = 1 1 2560 1440 -1279 1 1280 1024 
Simple fix. Make A and B vectors of different length. Then it is impossible to plot them flipped/switched.
You don't have the first part correct. Check your results with `size(yourMatrix)`.
Looks like he has generated a fit for a particular dataset, and now wants to find ‘goodness of fit’ parameters of that curve against a different dataset. OP, you have a curve, for which you can input the x-values from your second dataset, and output y-values. Then you can compare the output y-values to the second dataset for rms etc.
I'd start with the built in MATLAB [outlier detection algorithm](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/isoutlier.html), and just use the sliding window method, unless there is something about that method which you don't like?
Have you looked into [structures](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/structures.html)? You could have fields such as *Name* as a string, and *Faults* as the corresponding date/number of faults.
 sum(find(day==n))
Ohhh awesome! I had tried that method already but hadn't thought to use a sliding window method. Thanks!
But why is this the case? This doesn't make any sense, and I don't think I've run into this problem before. Also, Surf() won't plot unless the vectors are the same length...
That's the point. If A is 1x10 and B is 1x12 and Eff is 12x10, just transpose and plot and move on with life. It's just the way it is.
Just pointing out, MATLAB will do the sliding window for you as an input parameter to the function, so you don't have to do it yourself. 
Please see [our rules for submitting homework](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/462uwe/submitting_homework_questions_read_this/). You have to show us that you've tried, and ask a good question about where you're stuck. We don't do homework for you. 
I'm not entirely sure what you are asking. this should help https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/creating-and-concatenating-matrices.html 
Also, in the surf() function, it states X is the first variable. But then, the xlabel corresponds to the 2nd variable which is y? This doesn't make any sense...how can this be right...
Try adding a pause(0.01) after the strings are set. Sometimes when you make multiple changes to a figure at once it will wait until the code is completed before it actually updates the figure to it’s final state. 
You might be able to do it with Matlabs built in ODE solvers but I don't think the solve function could handle it. You would call the function by something like this [t, output] = ode15s(@(t, myinputs) myfunc(t, input1, input2, input3), [t_start t_end], [ic1 ic2]); then the main function would start like this function [derivative] = myfunc(t, myinputs) input1 = myinputs(1); % if it's just a value input2 = myinputs(2:10); % if it's a vector Let me know if you need more help. 
Yeah that worked, thank you!!
Gross. The command you're looking for is drawnow. 
Ok
To answer your specific question: You could use the eval function for that. It interprets the string that you give it as a command and executes it just as if you had typed it in. That way you could use a loop or something to build a string that contains exactly the amount of c_i that you need. Then do the same for w. I must warn you though, using eval is usually a sign that something is wrong. It can make code hard to read and debug. Most of the situations where one thinks of using it there is something wrong with the approach. Either because messing around with Arrays would be more sensible or a wholly different look at the problem is necessary. In your case, with the use of symbolic variables and the wish to have a flexible amount of terms it might be warranted.
Use the following resource: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/vectorization.html It explains the benefits of vectorizing your code in MATLAB and provides several easy to follow examples.
If you want to continue your name as index idea you could look into the sparse arrays and it’s related functions. Since these only store nonzero entries it should be possible to create an array of humongous size as long as only relatively very few positions are filled. That’s still a bit of a misuse of the index system so I wouldn’t recommend it. A saner approach would be to have an additional vector which contains the site numbers. If you have 300 sites this allows you to map a site name to a number in 1:300. that way you can work with small numbers while still being able to look up which site is referred to.
And looking at your code, [logical indexing](https://blogs.mathworks.com/loren/2013/02/20/logical-indexing-multiple-conditions/) will also help a lot. 
I read this before, but I don't see how I can go on to vectorize a conditional statement within a double for loop. I haven't used Matlab much, I just know how to do basic things really
Well I've given it a go over 6 hours and I feel like I'm getting nowhere. Essentially just looking at one of the sections (eg. x component): [a, b] = meshgrid(1:N,1:N); case1 = pos(1,a)&lt;=0.25 &amp; pos(1,b)&gt;=0.75; case2 = pos(1,a)&gt;=0.25 &amp; pos(1,b)&lt;=0.25; off = case1 - case2; s1(a,b) = s1(a,b) + (pos(1,a) - pos(1,b)+off).^2; but first of all, this essentially doesn't match the original code as s1 is the last row of s in the unedited code repeated in 100 rows, and the arrays it uses to get there are huge and won't scale well. **I should say, I'm using seed = 1234 and N=100 for testing, but N will be 20000.**
I don't see anything wrong with the code, as such, other than the lack of semicolons. You may have your Matlab script setup for page width when printed. You can do a line break by typing "..." then pressing the "Return/enter" key. My ellipses like this mess up frequently but they're a very useful tool. It's a good idea to format your code to page width because it's easier to print or share.
See if you're setting the terminal width somewhere in your preferences.
Thanks! \^^
Try meshgrid the values of "pos" and construct "case1" and "case2" from the new matricies you make, instead of generating a matrix of numerical indexes. When vectorizing, you shouldn't need to create the matricies "a" and "b" to index "pos". Look up using ":" to slice your matricies. Example: [posA,posB] = meshgrid(pos(1,:),pos(1,:)); Look at the outputs posA and posB and think about how you can use them to generate case1 and case2. This might help: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/matrix-indexing.html#bq7egb6-1
You can make arrays of symbolic variables, see the [second form of `sym()`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/sym.html).
Thanks, that helps a bit. So with posA and posB, I understand that I want to compare essentially every value in the same index of each for the cases, but I don't know how to code that after reading the help on logical indexing. I appreciate the help though, and what you said kind of made sense
Hey! so I kind of managed to get it working, only the s1 generated has values that are slightly different to the original s generated by the unedited code, and I'm not sure why (rounding or something?) So I used the code (just looking at x component): N=input('N = '); seed=input('Random number seed = '); rng(seed) pos=rand(3,N); [posA,posB] = meshgrid(pos(1,:),pos(1,:)); case1 = posA&lt;=0.25 &amp; posB&gt;=0.75; case2 = posA&gt;=0.25 &amp; posB&lt;=0.25; off = case1 - case2; s1 = s1 + (posA - posB + off).^2;
Similar to what u/PClough said, if you just want to simply solve initial value problems you can just use a built in solver like ode45. The code would look something like: myode = @(t,f) [f(2);d2x(t,f(1));y(4);d2y(t,f(1))] %this is your system of odes, Matlab has a funny way %of doing 2nd order odes, I would check the documentation. %set initial conditions and time interval f0 = [1,2,3,4]; times = [0, 1] %Now use built in solver [T,Y] = ode45(myode,f0,times) 
I am however still struggling to apply the same techniques to the last bit of the code, any hints? for a=1:N mindist=1e10; match(a)=0; for c=1:N if (a~=c) mindist=min(s(a,c),mindist); if (mindist==s(a,c)) match(a)=c; end end end end
Glad it’s working! I’m on mobile right now so it’s hard to give feedback, but that section may benefit from some logical indexing too. You can replace statements like this: N=length(x) for j = 1:N if x(j) &gt; .5 y = 3; else y=0; end end With: y = zeros(size(x)); y(x&gt;.5) = 3; The second statement forgoes the for loop with vectorization and makes the code cleaner and faster.
Nope, not set
I deleted the ellipses long ago, but the break is still there. I'm just going to have to deal with it
The line down the middle represents the 80 or 100 character line. As you type a long comment it will wrap to the next like for you. Traditionally, old programming languages (Fortran) didn't let you program past 80 characters. Also, good programmers try to code everything still within this width but it's mostly for ego (simple explanation). Anyways, there should be a setting for that in your preferences. For the future, never copy and paste from word doc as it changes formatting. Try notepad++ or wordpad.
I don't see anything wrong. That line is just telling you where the lines end if you were to print out the code. You can type past it if you want: code automatically will extend pass the line, comments will wrap to the next line by default but you can revert back to single line usage by deleting the new line character and continuing. You can change the appearance/color of the line in Settings.
90% sure you made something called size which isn't the build in function. That is, eithe r a variable in the workspace, or a function. you can use the functions 'whos' and 'which' to find out what's up
A bit late but... You can also combine all your columns into 1 matrix using square brackets. Then write 1 single fprintf(). With all your placeholders. Since MATLAB goes in columns when it pulls out the numbers but you want it to go through rows, use the apostrophe to flip your matrix. Something like this: fprintf('%15d %15.2f %15.2f\n', [COL1, COL2, COL3]' ); the trick is to have only 2 arguments: the format string and 1 matrix. (Don't forget the apostrophe after the square bracket and before the parenthese.)
Perfect, this is exactly what I wanted! I was trying with `eval()` as /u/annuges mentioned but was having a hard time, this is as simple as it comes. This is the code I used: num=input('select number of approximation functions\n'); w=0; for i=1:num C=sym('c', [1 i]); w=C(i)*((x/L)^(i+1)-(x/L)^(i+2))+w; end;
A month late... There is an easy way if all your data is numerical. Combine the columns into 1 matrix. [col1, col2, col3... etc]. Write 1 fprintf() only, with all your placeholders. However, flip the matrix because it reads it column wise, but you want it to print "row wise". For example: fprintf('%15d %15.2f %15.2f\n',[col1,col2,col3]' ); %don't forget the apostrophe after the bracket, and before the last parenthese.
.
That's a very legitimate point you have there. Honestly I never thought about it that way before.
This looks like an exercise in modelling/simulation class, does it not? Anyway, what I would do is work out the mathematical equations on paper first and then write that in matlab.
Great idea, your second idea is what I tried. My problem is how do I change translate a string such as E09000124 to be site number 1, then convert it back at the end? The site names don’t make much sense either for example E09000124 may is followed by S05040001
Not sure this is possible with scatter. What you could do is to use the primitive function plot, and create one plot for each marker in a loop. This way every marker can be of different size and color. A drawback of course is graphical performance, since you have a lot of graphical objects. But for a few points, this should work fine.
Reddit has a save feature for just this purpose...
Can you post your actual code? And the actual error message? Because looking at what I think you're doing, I did something like this: x = 1:10 y = 10:-1:1; z = cos(x) + sin(y); scatter3(x,y,z,[],z); and it works just fine. Obviously this is a contrived example, but it seems to illustrate what you want. My first guess is: is `z` a vector, the same size of `x` and `y` or is it an array, size `length(x) by length(y)` (like, made from a `meshgrid` command)?
 clear; clc; then re-run your code
Yep, this was it. MATLAB doesn't differentiate between function and variable names?
nope, the syntax for array indexing and passing parameters is the same (brackets () ), so matlab can't differentiate on syntax alone. Thats why you should ** Never shadow built-in functions by variables!**
a = ones(1,4); for i = 0:5 if(a%2 != 0) disp(a[i]); end end
What would you expect Matlab to do if you called size(1)? Just guess if you’re calling the variable or the function? You should never shadow a function with a variable name, that’s standard coding practice not even specific to Matlab.
&gt;app.app1.Value = app.Tview; Well do you have an app1 property of the object app? 
Use the input function then parse the equation as necessary and solve with the nonlinear optimizer of your choice 
I do not have an app1 property. I'm fairly new to MATLAB so what does this mean exactly?
 Your code: function TviewEditFieldValueChanged(app, event) app.Tview = app.TviewEditField.Value; app.app1.Value = app.Tview; end Not knowing more about your app I would suggest something like this: function TviewEditFieldValueChanged(app, event) TviewVal = app.TviewEditField.Value; putvar(TviewVal); end Which should produce a variable in your main workspace called TviewVal
&gt;MATLAB topics will be drawn from: advanced graphics (2D/3D plotting, graphics handles, publication quality graphics, animation), MATLAB tools (debugger, profiler), code optimization (vectorization, memory management), object-oriented programming, compiled MATLAB (MEX files and MATLAB coder), interfacing with external programs, toolboxes (optimization, parallel computing, symbolic math, PDEs). Seems like a 300 level math course for undergrads. 
from the plotting perspective, you'll want to look at the "plot" documentation with additional fields like LineWidth and Color: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/plot.html#btzpnds-1 using "figure; hold on" will allow you to plot multiple lines on the same axes. in terms of closest analogues, that's more of a mathematical-similarity problem, and there are lots of ways of doing this. A few options: 1) you could look at the slope from start to end 2) use an R^2 value between the data points for your reference signal and each of the other series regardless of the approach you use, you'll need some basic matlab knowledge on how to perform the operations; check the "Places to learn" section on the sub's summary on the right side of the screen (on desktop).
On the main window click "Layout" and select the one you want, one of which is "Default." You can just click the external editor close before you reset the layout.
You aren't sampling your signal fast enough to capture the actual behavior of the function. The theoretical minimum sampling rate to resolve a signal of frequency Fc is 2*Fc (look up Nyquist frequency). Change Fs to 2* Fc, at minimum. If you want it to look better, up Fs even more. What you're seeing is aliasing of the cosine you calculated at the frequency Fs you've sampled at. 
2Fc is 39,600 Fs is 80,000 That should be fine.
But why would you learn Matlab when you could learn python?
He's right about the sampling, but if you just choose a smaller scaling for X (try 1:10, in steps of 0.1, instead of 1:100 in steps of 1) you may avoid the aliasing. The function itself is fine, it's how you are plotting it that makes it look funny.
Hey guys, thank you for answering. It turns out you were right and it does work, I just had some kind of bug in my files, which made me unable to use that feature :) It was something with having a NaN value hiding somewhere
While Python may be more universal and you can do more things with it, Matlab is explicitly amazing for science and engineering fields. It was created for these fields. You can read more here on pros and cons: https://se.mathworks.com/products/matlab/matlab-vs-python.html#learn_why
Don’t make me laugh - Matlab was designed to *profit* off of these fields. Python, by its very nature, is open and transparent just as the best science and engineering are. Matlab is dying and the only reason it still exists is because of inertia and it’s use as a “teaching language” for undergrads but even then it’s advantage is waning. 
What is causing it to simulate that though?
If your on an older version like 2013...try ctrl-d. 
It’s aliasing, caused by under sampling. I suggest you use `fplot ` to plot functions.
Thanks
If you plot x alone as the y values, then it uses the indices as the x values. If you want to plot x vs. T, use plot (t,x); You can of course slice all you want too 
https://ibb.co/kPP9cb
Have you tried anything?
Here's what I've attempted! It's only one out of multiple tries. http://www.scribd.com/document/363855031/LWR
Yes, this is a MATLAB task, not a Simulink task. You can import your data into MATLAB using `dlmread`. As for your data- you'd have to ask the person who made the data or who is familiar with how the data was made to know where to define your radius of curvature. That's not a MATLAB question, and there's not "right" way- it's just however the person decided to do it. 
Can you post a photo of what you want your plot to look like and one that is wrong? 
So for each displacement ie (5 meters, 10 meters, 15 meters etc) Would I have to convert those points as a x,y point based on the curvature value for that displacement point using normal, tangential co-ordinates. And then, use a plot command to plot the x,y coordinates created, and thus, define my race track?
yes, use element wise division (A-B) ./ B
Also, jpeg (lossy) compressions seems like a bad idea for this operation
I also have the RAW format.
work on this bit: &gt; the Bowman sequence stored inside of a vector. Google should help you with the details. This may sound dickish, but I say this because 50% of learning how to code is learning what to google, and i dont want to take this opportunity away from you. doing that will probably allow you to see what other things you've done wrong so far. 
go with the RAW! jpeg introduces way to much compression artifacts that will mess with your planned operation.
But it's harder to deal with in MatLab, since it doesn't support NEF, so you have to convert etc. And conversions also seem to create loss of data (even to DNG).
(should work)[https://www.google.nl/search?ei=gSsDWtKZNZHCwQKExpLwBw&amp;q=load+raw+nef+file+in+matlab&amp;oq=load+raw+nef+file+in+matlab&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..33i21k1.14516.20381.0.20478.15.14.0.0.0.0.177.1405.1j10.11.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..6.8.1000...0i22i30k1j0i13i30k1j0i13i5i30k1j0i8i13i30k1j33i22i29i30k1j33i160k1.0.lWtDF3v5b-Q]
How about this? cmodel=(zeros(300,100,1)); fid=fopen('blackimage.raw','w+'); cnt=fwrite(fid,cmodel,'uint8'); fclose(fid); [Source](https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/94407-how-do-i-create-raw-image-files-in-matlab)
Nope. I opened nearly all of them and they all suggest converting, which is a pita.
Hmm even the [file exchange entry](https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/7412-raw-camera-file-reader) at the top has comments saying nef doesn't work great. Still, don't convert to jpeg, look for a file format you can convert to from NEF that you can import in matlab that is lossless
That sounds basically right. MATLAB will import the data as an array. You can then write a function which converts the points into (x,y) pairs, and then store those in a new array. And then plot your points. 
Your if's and elsif's aren't doing anything. You say "if(op == '+'), but then there isn't any code to execute there- so all of those statements don't do anything. Secondly, your `r = a op b` is invalid. You can't write MATLAB commands like that. If you want a string representation of a MATLAB command to be evaluated, you have to use `eval` but that is very much frowned upon and is not the way you should do it. Instead, you should make your if's and ifelse's do something- that is, inside of each of those statements write the appropriate command. And finally, don't use `==` to compare strings, use [strcmp](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/strcmp.html) instead. 
No, your Fc is 2*pi*Fc, so you need to double that number, which comes to 248,000.
https://i.imgur.com/HAMwZo9.png That's what I've changed so far. For the assignment the stuff I had in printf is supposed to be help text, and apparently by the end I'm supposed to have something where I can input calc(2,5,'+') and it works, so I took out the inputs. The if statements were working when I still had inputs in the code, so I don't think "==" is a problem (it was actually an example given by the assignment for something we should have) &gt;You can't write MATLAB commands like that. If you want a string representation of a MATLAB command to be evaluated, you have to use eval but that is very much frowned upon and is not the way you should do it. So what is the correct, non-frowned-upon way to do it? Honest question because the professor hasn't gone over this and usually when I define variables in the command window and write an expression (like "a + b") it works out fine. 
&gt; unspecified error hmm. &gt; I keep getting the error: Error using quad2d (line 100) A must be a finite, scalar, floating point constant That's a pretty specific error. It's tell you that 'a' (the second argument) isn't an appropriate value for what quad2d expects. Check what value sMin has.
The unspecified error and the error I wrote down are different errors. The unspecified error simply said that there was an error in the line using quad2d, with no other information. Although thanks for explaining the other error. I've got the code to run by changing the order of the pairs of integral limits. however I had to replace the r terms in my integrand, instead just copying in the expression for my anonymous function r
fplot yielded strange results. I still do not understand why it is adding aliasing in when I am not telling it to.
[Aliasing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing) 
**Aliasing** In signal processing and related disciplines, aliasing is an effect that causes different signals to become indistinguishable (or aliases of one another) when sampled. It also refers to the distortion or artifact that results when the signal reconstructed from samples is different from the original continuous signal. Aliasing can occur in signals sampled in time, for instance digital audio, and is referred to as temporal aliasing. Aliasing can also occur in spatially sampled signals, for instance moiré patterns in digital images. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/matlab/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
What data type is it ? If you're allocating a double matrix, that's about 7.6 gigs of memory for the 1 matrix alone. How much memory is on each of the machines? I can see how manipulating a 7.6 gig matrix could be a problem though. Depending on what you're doing to it (passing it to functions, etc) you could also be inadvertently making an intermediate copy of it somewhere too.
Is there a difference in RAM between the two machines?
It's a double yes. I am aware that it is a lot, but my mac handles it well. My mac has 8GB of RAM and the other machine 12GB.
If your matrix contains a lot of zeros you can use sparse matrix (https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/sparse.html?s_tid=gn_loc_drop) to reduce the amount of necessary memory. 
Sorry if I posted incorrectly, new to this sub and new to MATLAB in general I have been lurking but have not had a reason to post until now
Thanks for the help. One final question - how do you draw curved lines connected to straight lines? I've found this tutorial which tells you how to plot connected line segments which is exactly what I will be doing, however obviously not all my segments will be straight lines, and neither will my corners by constant radius. Here's the link which i'm referring to. https://uk.mathworks.com/help/vision/ug/draw-shapes-and-lines.html
thank you! this helped me a lot, and I actually managed to do it.
can you use single? that would cut your memory in half and has enough precision for many use cases. You could also look at the "Tall" array data type. I think they were introduced in R2016b. It lets you do some supported operations on very large arrays without loading the entire thing into memory. 
The `plot` command will connect the points you input with straight lines (the link you looked at is for a specialized toolbox for plotting shapes for vision studies- not what you want). If you don't like the resolution of the plot you'd make (thus, it doesn't look like a smooth curve) you'll have to interpolate more points between them and use those to "fill out" the curve. 
Are you running a 64 bit OS on your Windows and Linux Machine? 
Yes.
I can, but I don't want to since it's running fine on mac :) I just want to offload it to my other machine, because it has more resources and I am not using it most of the time.
If you know how to solve it by hand, you're well on your way to solving it in MATLAB. Basically, you write the commands of what you'd do by hand using MATLAB's "math language" to get your answer. However, if you don't know programming at all, this is a pretty big first task to tackle. Have you used MATLAB at all before? Do you have any code of at least setting up the problem? It's easier to help you if you show any code (even if it's awful) than none. If you really are starting from nothing, there are links in the sidebar for getting you started in MATLAB. The Mathworks one is pretty good, and has videos as well which is nice. 
There really aren't any good TLC references out there. I think the best info you're gonna find is either in the MathWorks doc or on your own by poring over TLC code shipped with the product and doing a tremendous amount of TLC debugging. As someone who has gone down this road, I'd suggest that you either 1. Use Legacy Code Tool (which generates TLC and S-Function source for you) 2. Deal with unlined S-Functions instead 3. Abandon S-Functions altogether and use System Blocks I've also heard it's being gradually phased out in favor of better ways to customize generated code, so even if you became the world's first TLC master you'd quickly become irrelevant.
It yielded a how bunch of different colored lines going horizontal across the screen. I just did fplot(x(1:100));
`fplot` is used to plot function handles, not numbers/vectors. Just look into the documentation 
Have you looked up where the memory is going on windows (for example using the task manager)? For example, you may have other windows processes taking up a lot memory outside of MATLAB. 
I have. Everything goes straight to MATLAB. I can't even take a screenshot it freezes so quickly.
&gt; better ways to customize generated code I've heard this as well but it's impossible to get a definitive answer as to what the 'current best practices' are. Because of how much legacy Mathworks has to support (or face a customer revolt) all of the 'old' ways still have active documentation in R2017b. I've seen back end code bases are largely unchanged from R13 because "it works" and no one is paying to start from scratch. Even 'new' product for us are sadly just copy, paste, and edited. 90% of our TLC/S-functions don't have any logic in them, they're just used as an interface between our embedded and MBD developers. Before that they were quite literally using global variables and data stores. (And wondering why the stack was huge). The few I've helped with I went with Level-2 MATLAB S-functions because they're easy to write &amp; maintain. But doing the TLC is still largely guess and check. &gt; you'd quickly become irrelevant. Given where I've seen TLC used and knowing how much COBOL and FORTRAN is still out there, learning TLC should be a nice path to retirement. Especially with how much MBD is in military aerospace projects. 
It's not that you're telling it too, it's an inherent result of taking points from a cosine at a non-multiple of the natural frequency. You might have learned about beat frequency - this is the same effect. Because 80000/19800 is around 4.04, your sampling will gradually drift away from the peaks. Try running these commands: Fs = 2* Fc StopTime = 0.1;Fc=198;Fs = Fc*2;dt = 1/Fs;t = (0:dt:StopTime)';x = cos(2 * pi * Fc * t);plot(t,x,'k'); hold on; Fs = 16*Fc StopTime = 0.1;Fc=198;Fs = Fc*16;dt = 1/Fs;t = (0:dt:StopTime)';x = cos(2 * pi * Fc * t);plot(t,x,'b'); Fs = 4.04*Fc StopTime = 0.1;Fc=198;Fs = Fc*4.04;dt = 1/Fs;t = (0:dt:StopTime)';x = cos(2 * pi * Fc * t);plot(t,x,'r'); Fs = 1.04*Fc StopTime = 0.1;Fc=198;Fs = Fc*1.04;dt = 1/Fs;t = (0:dt:StopTime)';x = cos(2 * pi * Fc * t);plot(t,x,'g'); Notice that the last two aren't sampling at an integer multiple of the natural frequency, so they end up missing the proper shape of the signal.
I think it’s rare that people deal with data of this size without breaking it up into more manageable pieces. If your math allows it, try breaking the matrix up into smaller components to process separately, then join up the results at the end (which are hopefully much smaller).
I'm not entirely sure how to solve it by hand either, the only code I have an idea of would be declaring a temperature for the north, east, south, and west nodes based on my bday but I'm not sure how to solve for the inner points using lu decomposition or gauss elimination at all. I mostly know how to do it if given a complete matrix but this is a totally unknown matrix. Would you happen to have a resource that shows how to solve such a problem? I've been googling how to do it for the past few days with horrible results, they all just show how to solve for 3 unknowns given a whole matrix 
Does the mac machine have an SSD and the windows/linux machine have a HDD?
if you don't mind me asking, what approach did you use for the similarity measure?
Please see [our rules for submitting homework](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/462uwe/submitting_homework_questions_read_this/) and show you've at least attempted the problem. 
Since your call to *figure* is nested under *if isempty(f)*, could it be that f is sometimes not empty? 
Yes. Is that the reason? Or a reason?
Have the Arduino print the values over the serial port and use a serial object in Matlab to read in the text as a string and parse out the values.
Would this be using fread(...)? I am trying to get that working but how do I specify which measurement I want to be read? 
not at all. the website where i get the spacecraft data from (cdaweb) allows you to select a timeframe and you can either download the data or plot it. i decided to plot the data starting on 11/06/2003-13/06/2003. from there i was able to click on "see previous time range". i looked for plots that most resembled what i wanted, i.e.: starting solar wind speed of ~700km/s and a steady decline during a 24 hour period. i then downloaded those similar analogues and plotted them on matlab. computed the median (this would be the forecast) and then compared it to the actual observations. took me a while to go through the data, i went back a little over 10 years and stopped when huge data gaps started to appear. but it's done!
fread reads binary data, not text. Since you have multiple values per data point, I would send each as a line and read that line in with fgetl (and then parse with the string with another command) or use fscanf.
I'm on mobile so only skimmed your code, but if you want the plot to draw on command, look up _drawnow_.
 # show image and get the image handle obj = imshow(...) # change image properties, including position set(obj, NAME, VALUE) See matlab documentation for more info
Try y=x.*sin(x) The dot might be on the other side of *, can’t remember and am on mobile
 y=x.*sin(x) The dot before the asterisk indicates a vector operation, which does what you asked. If you only the dot, MATLAb will do matrix multiplication of the vector X and the vector sin(x). You should also read up on For loops.
What does your error say?
Plot a vector vs a matrix
https://pastebin.com/ss5bxzQa this is my current code, how do you mean? Could you show?
For 1. The index of x cannot be 0. Your index k needs to starts at 1. 
what's wrong is that this gives you an error that apparently you didn't even look at, because the error this gives you is crystal clear.
You don't know element-wise multiplication vs. matrix multiplication?
[hold on](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/hold.html)
this is pretty vague, what do you mean specifically? you're going to need two cameras unless one camera can also sense depth
Oh missed to write that I have tried with hold on but doesnt get it to work :/
it works but you aren't using it correctly. you need to decide if you want to plot all the data at once using the matrix of data for all N, or if you want to plot each case separately using hold and loop over N
I see. This is frustrating lol Tried something like this below but doesnt work... :/ I pasted my code in pastebin above if you'd like to have a look and help me. plot(T,U,'r') hold on N=100; plot(T,U,'g') 
That's just plotting the exact same dataset twice. When you say plot(T,U,'r'), it's plotting the data in U over T. When you say N=100, that doesn't change anything about U, you need to recompute U with N=100 if you want to obtain that data. So with the code you posted you're just plotting the same data twice after changing the value of N, you aren't actually recomputing U with N=100 before plotting that case.
Sorry about that, I'm new to this part of the language. What I meant to say was, [to do this ](https://youtu.be/be6Iw0QrI8w?t=20m17s) , will I need two cameras?
You need a stereo camera, or two different cameras to make a stereo camera system. In theory if your robot is able to move, you can get away with just one camera, but such an application is much more advanced and doesn't work well to capturing other moving objects.
Yes, you syntax is incorrect, see the documentation [for impixel](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/impixel.html) and what it says the arguments 'c' and 'r' should correspond to.
I'm not really sure why the duplicate point occurs or is necessary, are there two y-values associated with the same x-coordinate? That seems a little strange, but... that being said, can you just remove the duplicate point? Or assign the y-value at that point as the mean of the duplicates?
You would use [plot3](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/plot3.html)
Thank you
Duplicate point is required for defining a multi-point BVP.
Can you use `deval` instead of `interp1` ?
Yeah, reading the documentation, it really is a duplicated point (x,y pair). So, just remove that pair. 
I actually ended up getting something that was able to constantly update the images + move with the arrow keys!: while(1) h = figure(1); imshow([World{1,:};World{2,:};World{3,:};World{4,:};World{5,:};World{6,:};World{7,:};World{8,:};World{9,:};World{10,:}]); waitforbuttonpress; g = get(h,'CurrentKey'); if strcmp(g,'rightarrow') World{x, y} = Blank; y = y+1; elseif(strcmp(g,'leftarrow')) World{x, y} = Blank; y = y-1; elseif(strcmp(g,'uparrow')) World{x, y} = Blank; x = x - 1; elseif(strcmp(g,'downarrow')) World{x, y} = Blank; x = x + 1; end World{x, y} = Player; end 
 figure hold on for n=1:100 [T,U] = yourfunctionhere(x*n+y); plot(T,U,'r'); end You have to iterate what the data you're plotting is. Also note that the above is all going to be the same color.
This is not a technical question
ESPN doesn't have [an API for Fantasy](http://www.espn.com/apis/devcenter/docs/) so you have really limited options. Basically you have to [page scrape](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) which is a pain in the butt. 
And if you do scrape the webpage, [this guide](https://blogs.mathworks.com/loren/2017/07/10/web-scraping-and-mining-unstructured-data-with-matlab/) will be probably be useful. Unfortunately, MATLAB does does not really have any HTML parsing tools, so you basically have to use something like regex which is a terrible waste of time. MATLAB is not at all the right tool for the job to do web scraping.
Simplify a lot. There is no need for symbolic variables. Just use your parameter variables straight into each expression. MATLAB will evaluate each expression based on the actual values of x and y that it has pre-set in the test suites.
It says "Undefined function 'sub' for input arguments of type 'double'" what does that mean?
To answer your original question "why doesn't it work"? You created x as a symbolic var. but right after, you overwrite that by giving it the value from the parameter. So right there, there is no more symbolic variable. When you write your expr1, MATLAB's now using values on the right side (NOT symbolic vars). So by the time you reach sub(), well there is no "symbolic expression" to substitute anything into.
That's why I mean below. It's like you wrote sub(22.3, x, y).... expr1 is a double by now, so there is nothing to "substitute". sub() works for symbolic vars, but not double. 
I figured it out. I didn't even have to use the subs function 
correct! just 2 lines of code. :)
Just google the regular expression to use, it's only a few lines of code to clean up the HTML. The webread and urlread functions come to mind to read in the raw HTML on the page.
Thanks man
That’s one way to do it lol
Stop using symbolic variables. Forever. 
Yeah ok... But I want them in different colours of course :/
Yeah true.
Even if I do the for loop again but with other variables my plot just says "index ecxceeds matrix dimensions"
What's your training data? 
Well I agree you shouldn't use it in any kind of computation in matlab. I did find the symbolic variables handy in some of my courses. For example if you have an integral you are working out by hand and you want to double-check if it is correct or not. Or if you have a matrix with theoretical coefficients and you need to compute eigenvalues. So I wouldn't say, never ever use it, but it can be good in the applications meant for it.
It's common practice to indent after the use of figure or it is just you?
The norm of one row would be `norm(A(n,:)) ` Where A is the matrix, n is the row you want the norm of, and the colon selects the entire row instead of one value. No need to write your own function 
I suspect you're getting caught on one of two points: callback functions and callback arguments. For callback functions, the app won't do anything until it receives an appropriate command. Basically you have to tell the app that when "X" happens, it needs to run "Y" code. "X" can be many things - pushing a button, releasing a button, moving a slider, etc. You'll have to decide what the best choice is, but for a user entered number, probably you want the code to run when the user clicks a button. Here's a page that shows a simple example of adding a callback function in the App Designer (step 5-7): https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_guis/create-and-run-a-simple-app-using-app-designer.html for more detail, read here: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_guis/app-designer-callbacks.html For callback arguments, the properties of the app are stored in the app object. In general, things are stored as *app.Component.Property*. You should be able to rename the Component as needed, but the Property is fixed based on the type of component. This page has some details that should help: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_guis/app-designer-callbacks.html
&gt; process some data in chucks This is pretty vague, are you doing a rolling window over the image or are you just splitting the image into 250 chunks and analyzing them? The code you posted isn't really doing much in relation to chunks. Right now your question is similar to: "I'd like to deep-fry a turkey, I don't know where to begin, I think I'd need to use knives somewhere, I've found this recipe for making a turkey sandwich, can someone help?" You need to think about how to write a loop (or nested loops!) to iterate over all chunks. Something like: img = randn(100,100) for i = 1:10 for j = 1:10 chunk = img(10*i-9:10*i,10*j-9:10*j); % Do something with chunk end end
Do I need both a callback argument and callback function for what I want to do? From my understanding I should make a callback function for a push button that when it is clicked, the values in my editfields will be stored as some corresponding numeric variable in my source code?
I'm honestly really trying. I'm going mental over this. My lecturer basically took us from 'here's how to add and multiply, and here's what for loops do' and a week later gave us this problem. I'm gonna try what you wrote and tweak it however well I can. Thanks a truckload for helping me out I fly appreciate it. I'm gonna look up with image processing toolbox is and try that too.
When you create a callback function, it will automatically use callback arguments. The callback arguments will be how you access the values in your editfields. An example, if you create a callback function "doStuff()", you will end up with something like this: function doStuff(app,event) variable = num2str(app.EditField.Value); variable = 4*variable; app.Label.Text = variable; end The above code reads the value from a field called "EditField", multiplies that value by 4, and then displays the result in a label called "Label". The default layout of the App Designer has valid objects on the top right. You can select these objects and see their properties on the bottom right. The top left can help locate and rename your functions.
Step 1) create a vector, *n*, that goes from 1 to 1000 in increments of one. Step 2) using element-wise operations, raise (-1) to the *n + 1* power and divide by *n*. Step 3) use the **sum** function to sum the vector. 
What is your system? Run bench 
Use the delay function to pause the program after plotting, then plot the next point. If you are plotting multiple things at each time point, I think you'll have to give each plot a handle, and delete it before plotting the new points 
You want to use [drawnow](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/drawnow.html) paired with `pause`. Reading the doc on drawnow offers some good examples. 
[removed]
I want to draw points or dots that basically represent a drone going from one point to another. I see the example only have normal plots. Do they have examples with dots? 
What!!! No loops?!?!?!?!
MATLAB doesn't plot dots differently from lines, dots are just a lines with a different style. But if it helps, the process will be basically this: h_drone = plot(drone_x_data(1), drone_y_data(2), '.'); for ii = 2:100 set(h_drone, 'XData', drone_x_data(ii), 'YData', drone_y_data(ii)); drawnow pause(0.1); end

I'll read the examples and test this out. Thanks.
Loops are for cucks! Vectorised implementations are the new alpha.
The best answer is just to reformat your functions so that it accepts any size of vector size as a single input argument, instead of splitting over the elements of the vector over multiple input arguments. If you really do not want to do that.. I know its possible to use the contents of a cell into a stream of input arguments. For example: p = {1,2}; a = plus(p{:}); Will have 1 as the first input argument and 2 as the second input argument. So in theory you could just convert your vector X0 to a cell via num2cell and then just do X0{:}. But that seems like a hackish way of doing this.. instead of properly formatting your functions.
use a gpuarray.... parallelism to the max.
Perhaps the issue is your system.
&gt;&gt; bench ans = 0.3767 0.1787 0.0654 0.1213 0.8455 0.7371 i5, 8gb ram, ssd OS: fedora
I have an i5 and 8gb ram and an ssd, what do I need to start matlab in under 10 seconds?
res=0; for n=1:1000 tmp = ((-1)^(n+1))/n; res = res + tmp; end
I think quantum computing could really speed things up.
Why does it have to be under 10 seconds?
but I like loops.
I simply don't understand, why would it need more? My operating system starts in 10 seconds.
As a reference: i5-4300U, 8Gb Ram, Matlab on non-ssd: 0.2817 0.2163 0.0903 0.1511 0.5584 0.5314 i7-2700K, 32Gb RAM, Matlab on SSD 0.1697 0.1455 0.0918 0.1215 0.3412 0.3546 
Your operating system ~= MATLAB. Don't compare them as equals.
Honestly, I'd stay away from the toolbox until you get more comfortable with the basics. The toolboxes can be great and are super powerful, that's kind of running before you can walk.
I can assure you that there's no need to lecture me on their equivalence, I studied Computer Science. This stupid program is simply inefficient. There's absolutely no need for it to spend 10 minutes on startup loading anything. If there is that much to load, then load it on demand. It's not like that loading makes matlab faster, it's still slow, the GUI, the functions, everything is slow about it.
I can tell you, it's not the speed of your machine. Your machine might be screwed up, but I've run MATLAB on much less machine no problem. Some troubleshooting: Is MATLAB installed locally, or are you running it remotely? If you're at a university, a lot of times you're actually running MATLAB through a virtual machine. If that's the case, I'd check my internet connection. Even if your connection to the internet is good, perhaps something between you and the school? Like, your virus protection not liking the VPN? Other things to check. Do you have a script named startup.m in your path? If so, that runs whenever you boot up MATLAB. It might be causing you a problem if it's doing something nasty. Maybe your pathdef is all screwed up. Trying resetting it following [these instructions](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/restoredefaultpath.html).
&gt; I can assure you that there's no need to lecture me on their equivalence, I studied Computer Science. *eyeroll* OK, whatever. &gt;This stupid program is simply inefficient. There's absolutely no need for it to spend 10 minutes on startup loading anything. If there is that much to load, then load it on demand. It's not like that loading makes matlab faster, it's still slow, the GUI, the functions, everything is slow about it. So don't use MATLAB. *wow, that was easy*
Naw man, don't you know? The OP studied Computer Science! He can't possibly be wrong, it's TOTALLY MATLAB'S fault. /s. Thanks for giving another avenue for troubleshooting.
loop is way unnecessary here. if you want to compute a mathematical sum you're mind should always think about enumerating the set and then using the [sum](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/sum.html) function
If you want that kind of launch speed convenience open a terminal, launch python and import numpy. Matlab runs on a Java VM and it is not fast by any stretch but it’s easy to use for us unwashed engineers. R2016b launches in about 15 seconds on my 15” rMBP (i7, 16GB, 512GB SSD) so clearly something is wrong. How fast does it take to launch in a terminal without GUI?
I wish, man. But for some reason, everyone in academia is hell bent on using matlab even for stuff that it completely fails at. I wish python was used more often, but I'm forced to use MATLAB. Of course, in this case, that I hate its guts.
you mean `matlab -nodesktop`? it takes about 5 seconds, more towards less, than more
So what does tell you?
about half a second I'm really not sure what's the issue, I don't think it's related to graphics
a convolution should work if the "do something with chunk" is an operation that can be expressed as such. then, sample from the outputs of the convolution if the chunks are supposed to be non-overlapping (which the loop appears to be doing). if the OP is new to this though, i'd recommend using the loops to get more familiar with segmenting images/matrices.

I'm not certain that's possible. Is there LabVIEW format proprietary? If it's a proprietary binary file format, then reading it would require reverse engineering the format, or getting code from National Instruments to read it. If it's some kind of text format then you can probably read it as text and parse out the data. 
Well when I open the .lvm file it just opens in a text editor file so I would assume I can just read it in that way I just don't really know how to get that done.
Eps is a built in Matlab function. Don't use it as a variable name. 
So go use your *Computer Science* brain, and your *Computer Science* skills, and your *Computer Science* google-fu, and the things others have figured it out and wait not even I want to do all that. *Computer Science*
Did you try just importing it? If it's just a txt file it should work like anything else 
I feel dumb for not knowing how to set it up in LabView (our VI is set up by another team), but at work we do this all the time by saving our LabView data as CSV or TXT files. You can then use a variety of Matlab commands to read them in. I personally like "readtable" for LabView data since it handles header lines and variable names well. 
First you inform me of the obvious fact that OS != MATLAB, ok. Now what do you want? I told you that I study CS so that you know that I know what an OS is and I understand how software works, in general terms, in terms of abstraction. What you're saying now is that I can understand a proprietary piece of software that probably has millions of lines of code just because I have a CS degree. It's just quicker to ask other people that probably had the same problem you had, as I imagined that this issue is very common.
I've always saved the data through LabVIEW as a .txt file and read it in using MATLAB's load command. Don't mess with LabVIEW's format. It may be slightly faster, but is mostly useful for only their stuff.
&gt;It's just quicker to ask other people that probably had the same problem you had, as I imagined that this issue is very common. So then if it's so common *Why haven't you found the solution in your own googling? * Or was it too hard and did you give up? Or is it actually relatively rare?
Thanks for the info, guys! I ended up just pasting stats in excel and reading off excel. 
I did this a while back in Torch. To simplify the logic, I made a rotated copy of the board after it receives an action so that it always shifts up. Then, just loop through every element and check for nonzero values above it. Add a few if-statements and you're set! You can see my old code [here](https://github.com/patrick-klein/game-ai/blob/master/games/twenty48.lua). Relevant code is in the method `updateBoard`. Note: My implementation differs from 2048 when there are three values that can be merged together. I think mine merges the last two instead of the first two. 
While I truly appreciate it, I really only know the basics of matlab as that's all we've been taught thus far so I was kinda more hoping that someone could guide me through coding it and also explain how it works. I've found various completed versions of it online, but I would rather understand what to do with the menu function thing as our teacher only introduced how to make it, not what to do after you have it and in case anyone asks questions about it if it has to be projected to my class it would probably be good to know what i'm talking about instead of just copying someone else.
Short answer: this is not Matlab's fault. When you type fprintf('\b'); then Matlab prints the byte 0x08 to the terminal. (that is, from 0-255 as possible values of a byte, Matlab prints a byte with the value "8"). It is up to the terminal to interpret the "8" as a backspace character, which [is its meaning in the ASCII spec.](http://www.asciitable.com/) You can tell this is the case by executing: double(sprintf('\b')) ... and by casting that char to a double array, you can see it has the value "8". So Matlab is doing everything right-- it is your terminal that is not properly interpreting the "8" as a backspace. The solution is to instruct your terminal to handle backspace properly before running Matlab. These two links have some hints: [http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard.html](http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard.html) [https://www.unix.com/shell-programming-and-scripting/156900-stty-erase-h-not-working-backspace.html](https://www.unix.com/shell-programming-and-scripting/156900-stty-erase-h-not-working-backspace.html) If you still can't get it, post your OS, your shell program, and anything else you can think of.
1. It’s orth(A), not ortho(A) 2. What does the error say?
Oh thank you! I wouldn't have caught that lol and it was saying : field assignment to a non structure array. Is that all this step was asking and the next step is verifying correct?
OP doesn't care. OP just wants to bitch. Good for OP.
If you save in tdms format then do some trickery in LabVIEW you can then use a MATLAB script to convert the "fixed" tdms to mat format. More info at the link below: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/44206-converttdms--v10-?requestedDomain=www.mathworks.com
I used images converted into a row matrix
You can code with me anyday!
Have you looked at Alexnet?
I know it doesn't really matter in matlab, but if you're working with hardware with limited memory, this is more than an acceptable way of doing it. + you don't have the added expense of generating the vector with values this way. 
Seems like it. To verify take the dot product of A and B and if it equals 0 then they’re orthogonal to each other. Or find the angle between them and if it equals 90 degrees they’re orthogonal to each other.
&gt; Oh wow, you're so smart. Good for you, you know what an OS is. That's exactly why I told you that I study CS, so that you don't bother me with stupid, obvious information such as "OS != matlab". I see that now you finally understand. You should thank me for lighting a torch in your dim brain.
Care about what, the program? Of course I don't, it's rubbish, but I need to fix the problem.
I just... I just don't understand your brain. What the hell are you trying to accomplish with your rambling? You posted like 10 comments after I told you that it was idiotic to tell me that "OS != matlab". I just told you that there's no need to tell me an obvious thing. I know that people who use MATLAB are usually mentally limited and they're only good at being academic tool-men that solve research problems for universities, but please bear with me, and understand the fact that I am not interested in what you are struggling to communicate to me.

Apparently counting is hard for you. Go back to school.
Yet you haven't yet. Nice job applying those *Computer Science* skills.

I get his question now. He's asking you why do you use a while loop? As in what problem does it solve. You're asking why something works on the first iteration but not the second. So.... Also have you tested your mod() statement? I don't think that's going to work as it's written.
You can use a while loop to make sure your input is valid. Basically, in pseudo code: while !valid input = get_input(); valid = validate_input(); end 
Just make sure your paths are set up correctly in .bash_profile

using Ctrl+I on a highlighted section (or individual line) will auto-indent, but won't do the white-space padding to my knowledge.
Why would I want to indent that ?
Hey there. I have what will probably be my last questions. First of all, why is the function called pp_darc2 = dl_squared(pp); %? That is, which part of that equation is the function's name? And what is the purpose of the side of the equation that is not its name? Secondly, why is a square rooted polynomial complicated to deal with? I mean, wouldn't the computer solve it like any other polynomial? Thirdly, how is getting the polynomial coefficients done? I understand the principle and reason behind it, but don't understand what each part in [breaks,coefs,1,k,-] = unmkpp(pp); does. Lastly, there is k in almost every line of the function. What is it? I can't see it defined anywhere in the code. Thanks a ton.
Maybe some ports of your router is blocked. Are you behind a firewall?
not those lines in particular, but if you google "matlab autoformat code" you'll likely get the Ctrl+I shortcut. in the link, it appears as though altering the indentation is included in PyCharm's reformatting. 
thanks for reply but i'm looking for algorithms about road extraction from satellite images which goes under feature extraction category and that thing you mentioned is just a tool . i want others code to help me learn some tips for my algorithm simulation 
Do you want to implement the two solvers by hand as a learning exercise or do you want to use the built in capabilities of matlab for that? If it’s the latter: Matlab has a very extensive documentation system. Take a look at the various ode solvers. For example ode45 implements a 4/5th Order adaptive Runge Kutta method. There should be a variety of methods available, including the ones you are looking for. The documentation should explain their use sufficiently for you to use.
well i guess either works, but how do I compare both methods in one thing? 
I think you need to be more specific with your questions. Do you have trouble formulating the math? Or do you know exactly what to do but are stuck on some matlab specific implementation detail?
Ok so quick update, I've made a callback function for a button similar to the one you wrote up there. I didn't do the whole multiplying by 4 thing but I declared my variable and set it equal to app.TviewEditField.Value. That should would right? Why am I getting this error where I declared my variable name saying that the value assigned to the variable might be unused?
Take a look at the Statistics Toolbox
Did you figure this out? Im having the same issue in matlab2017b, on a windows 10. Was fine in windows 7 (just updated recently) and on a reinstall of maylab cogent no longer works. 
Do you know the basics of Matlab? Creating vectors and matrices, for-loops, indexing, functions, etc?
it is probably the same as in fortran/scilab/etc right? then, yes
I'd like to know how I call those functions D:
Try ['Transplant'](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Transplant/). It is a third-party package but it works with recent versions of Python (unlike the MATLAB engine for Python) and it avoids some of the problems with the MATLAB engine for Python (like not being able to do math directly).
What are „those functions“? The ones specifying your differential equations? The ode solvers? Just look at the documentation. ode45 has a very nice help entry that explains its usage very well. There are some usage examples at the bottom that should cover most of what you want to do. Of course you are looking for different methods than ode45 but all the different ode solver variants are set up nearly exactly the same. Im starting to think that there isn’t a dedicated built in Euler solver among the ode family though. Since you probably have to implement that yourself you might as well also do the Runge Kutta yourself as well.
I fixed it myself. I had put in 'constant' block and then it doesn't want to eat your matrix, but when you put in a 'from workspace' block it loves the data and eats it right up :)
1) write code to perform euler integration on a differential equation 2) write code to perform runge-kutta integration on a differential equation 3) compare the results
do you have any matlab experience? how would you solve this using pencil and paper?
hello can someone please help me solve for the nontrivial zeros of the riemann zeta function sum(1/n^2)(n=1--&gt;Inf) also I need to be able to derive a constructive proof of P=NP
It's just a matrix that you could visualize with imagesc
Ok I added axes in my GUI how do I add a matrix into it
why don't you trying searching the mathworks documentation?
surely you have some equations to relate the input variables to the desired output?
I have been, but haven't found anything relevant. Can you link me the relevant documentation
https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/imagesc.html
Tyvm, how do I implement this into the GUI?
There are some given design parameters in certain ranges for compression ratio, stroke/bore ratio, rod length/ stroke ratio, IVC, IVO, EVC, EVO, and spark timing, but I don't know where to start with those in finding out the inputs to the outputs. 
I'm assuming that the 'LaguerreGaussianE' function comes from the 'paraxial optics toolkit' on MATLAB File Exchange. Looking at, and running, your code shows no issues that I can find. In fact I think the code is running perfectly and outputting the expected result: the (0,0) order Laguerre-Gaussian mode is axi-symmetric, i.e. the spatial energy distribution does not vary with theta. Have a look at some plots of Laguerre-Gaussian modes online, and have a play with some higher order modes.
Go through your lectures notes/books and find the equations you need. Then when you have those equations, use them to figure out how to all neccesary computations (on paper!). Once you know all of that, then its just a matter of coding into matlab.
Well before you even start in matlab you need to define what you want to do you. You need a model or equations, matlab can't do what you don't know how to do on your own
Thank you, I'll try
there has to be another for or while loop that you omitted from the code right? nothing is iterating over j and there needs to be a parent look for the set i+1 to do anything...
Sorry the second I should be j=j+1
The meshgrid approach in your edit is the way to go with for most matlab plotting functions. I assume you tried to pass those to your G function in order to avoid the loops in your initial comment. As you found out that only works if your G is written in a way that works with vector inputs. But you can still use the meshgrid output to help with plotting the Z matrix you got through your loops. X,Y and Z should all be of the same size and contain everything needed to plot. Try: surf(X,Y,Z) for a 3D plot of your data. You can fix the camera to look from straight above to get more of a 2D heatmap look. I often use imagesc for quickly displaying 2D data. I think that one actually doesent want meshgrid data for the xy info but ust the vectors. For a quick look you can also just give it just the matrix, it will then assume unit spacing for all dimensions 
well it's weird because it used to work some time ago. I wouldn't say I changed something. anyway you guys are able to see mathworks videos on their website? 
Searching 'runge-kutta matlab' on Google gave me links to people asking how to fix their code along with answers. There are probably some examples, too. I'm sure something there will help you out.
i wouldn't expect to be able to go from "never used the program" to a running script that solves a differential equations using Runge-Kutta in less than a day. But if you want to try: 1) Do the tutorials to get started with matlab on the sidebar 2) Write code that solves a different equation using Euler's method 3) Edit code from part (2) to use Runge-Kutta integration
Have a look at the sidebar, there are a bunch of introductions to matlab listed. The documentation within matlab is also very good if you have specific questions on how things work. Runge Kutta methods are quite straightforward to implement so you only need a few basics. Essentially it’s just a loop with some basic math in it. I assume you understand the math part of Runge Kutta methods, so grab one of the tutorials, start implementing stuff and if you get stuck and have specific questions you can’t answer with the documentation you can ask in here.
what?
what what? What did I do wrong?
If they never programed before? Sure, a day might be a bit challenging. But I would assume that someone who has had at least a tiny bit of exposure to coding should get up to speed pretty quickly. Using exactly the steps you outlined. Unless I’m not overlooking something Runge Kutta doesn’t really involve any matlab specific quirkiness with vectorization or such which could be confusing to a newcomer. As long as you understand what an array is and how a loop works you can almost write down the math from a textbook as is.
Okay! I was worried since I have never programmed here but I will see what I can do. If its arrays and loops i might be able to manage!
Thank yoU! I will definitely ask if specific questions come up! 
I have low expectations for most people that ask questions like this here 
Have you tried docking. From what I google, it always seems to be that. CtrlD. Or click the little blue arrow down, at the top right of the editor window.
It used to be a selectable setting, it is now (v7+) an ‘implicit’ setting, meaning that if you dock the window, Matlab will remember this and dock future new scripts. [Mathworks staff answer](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/95597-how-can-i-set-a-preference-for-the-matlab-editor-debugger-to-open-files-in-separate-windows-or-in-ta)
Using pagefun should work well in this situation (assuming you have the Parallel Computing Toolbox). If not, you may have some luck with bsxfun...
shoot, pagefun may only work on GPU arrays, which may or may not be a big deal for your situation. unfortunately i'm not at a machine that can test it out for CPU variables.
It cannot find an explicit solution but you could solve the equation numerically
Oh okay, I'll look into that. I was curious why this might not be working but I can try that too. Thanks :)
There are many ways to do it. From `doc struct` [link here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/struct.html?s_tid=srchtitle), you can do it by: 1. Do it your way (I don't like it) students = struct; students(idx).FILEDNAME = VALUE; e.g. students(1).name = 'Joe Bruin'; 2. Initialize the struct first, and fill in values student = struct('name', [], FIELDNAME, []); students(1).name = 'Joe Bruin'; 3. If I already know all values of the struct, I will fill it in upon initialization. This is an excerpt from my recent project: loop_1 = struct(... 'length', {4, 5, 2, 5},... 'angle', {pi, acos(3/5), pi, -acos(3/5)}... ); By filling 1x4 cell arrays into the struct values, I obtained a 1x4 struct. p.s. Please read the documentation thoroughly, it will take less time to actually read the documentation/google for answers from my personal experience.
 field1 = 'Name'; value1 = {'John', 'Anne', 'Leslie'}; field2 = 'RNumber'; value2 = {'R11549782', 'R11572468', 'R11596248'}; field3 = 'Address'; value3 = {'3527 Charmaine Lane','2287 Oak Lane','335 Emma Street'}; field4 = 'Courses'; value4 = {'boo'}; field5 = 'Societies'; value5 = {'fourth'}; s = struct(field1,value1,field2,value2,field3,value3,field4,value4,field5,value5); There's what I have so far and it works, but I dont't know how to make Courses have fields itself. I need it to have a course name, number, teacher, and location field but I don't know how I'd do that. 
I actually re-did it and made this: clear all; close all; clc; field1 = 'Name'; value1 = {'John', 'Anne', 'Leslie'}; field2 = 'RNumber'; value2 = {'R11549782', 'R11572468', 'R11596248'}; field3 = 'Address'; value3 = {'3527 Charmaine Lane','2287 Oak Lane','335 Emma Street'}; field4 = 'Courses'; value4 = {'CHEM 3305, JOUR 2, CS 1', 'ECO 2301, ENGL LIT, BIOL 1', 'INST 1401, MATH 0410, MATH 1452' }; field5 = 'Societies'; value5 = {'Honor Society, Tennis Team', 'Swim Team, Student Council', 'Choir, Band, Volleyball'}; student = struct(field1,value1,field2,value2,field3,value3,field4,value4,field5,value5); I just don't understand how to created fields for the field Courses. 
I bet your error says something like “index must be a positive integer or logical.”
You can use nested cell array so each student can have a cell array containing a list of their classes.
You can use a nested struct array, i.e. put another structure inside the first one
Use if statements for the indices and you want your s-value to be a 3x5-matrix as well.

Fair enough
https://pastebin.com/tTci1Crk here is the actual code, sorry for bad formatting
Yeah, you're correct; it's a very handy toolkit. This does make sense, been too busy concentrating on issues on my coding and completely overlooking the physics! :( Thanks for the response.

Could you clarify what you're trying to accomplish? It's not clear to me what you want the code to do. Do you need to sometimes return 'f' and other times return some other variable 'q'? 
I would recommend cheating by adding a zero frame around your numbers then starting your calculation at (2,2) to (end-1:end-1).
So rename the variable? Hilight the variable and press "q" on your keyboard. 
Do you have Pluckeye installed? That gave me the same issue for Mathworks videos.
There is no "right" way of doing this since there's an infinite number of ways to connect your points. However a method which you may find useful is [delaunay triangulation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/delaunay.html?requestedDomain=www.mathworks.com). 
Thank you for the reply. I've attempted this method and I'm getting a very strange plot. Here's the code I'm using, where z,t, and u are all 1001x1 tri = delaunay(z,t,u); trisurf(tri,z,t,u); shading interp The plot looks like this https://imgur.com/a/d2rA1 Any ideas? Thanks a lot in advance

It works. Thank you a lot
If you just say `plot3(z,t,u, '.');` do the points lie on your surface? If so, what don't you like about your surface? If not, I'd have to look at what was going wrong. 
The error is clear. You don’t define the variable xm before you use it. 
but its the output of a function, isn't it defined being an output of the function?
No, you indicating the variable in the output doesn’t define the variable. It just tells Matlab which variables to tunnel into the output channel when the function is finished running. You need to define xm before you start calling xm(i-1) or any entry in it. 
Yes, that's the error message that I got: "Subscript indices must either be real positive integers or logicals"
I agree. As a mod, one of the things I want this sub to become is a resource for newbies and experiences MATLAB programmers alike. However, right now it's mainly experienced MATLAB programmers helping newbies with homework questions. I tried to do "themed" days a while back. Well, mainly I did "MATLAB Tips Tuesday." It started off good, but as time went on we got fewer and fewer tips. I think people sort of "ran out" of tips to give. Also, I missed a few weeks when I was on vacation, and never got back to it. Perhaps, if there was a way to automate it (I'm sure someone who knows how to use Automod could set this up) it would be better. I also like you ideas for different, more advanced days. Puzzle days/coding competitions (someone pose a problem, someone else writes the solution in fewest lines/fastest execution time). We could have something like the +'s we give out for helping OP, where you get some sort of flair for solving problems. I'm willing to put in time to try to grow the sub, but what I don't have a lot of time to do is generate content. If others want to help generate content, and someone who wants to set up Automod and wants to be a mod, let me know and I'll discuss with the other mods. 
I've posted about it before, but there seems to be a few people that immediately downvote every newbie question. 
Like Photoshop battles, maybe make weekly Matlab battles. Just saying.
So let me ask you this: What happens when you compute the sum for the position (1,1). Your formula works out to be s = A(0,1) + A(2,1) + A(1,0) + A(1,2); But A(0,1) and A(1,0) aren't valid entries for the matrix A, so you need to write more code to accommodate cases around the edge of the matrix. Another thought: What happens if A is 3x5 and you compute the sum for the position (3,1)? s = A(2,1) + A(4,1) + A(3,0) + A(3,2); Is A(4,1) a valid entry? How about A(3,0)?

Func_A is 1x51^2. Try switching it to 51^2 x 1 and see if it works.
Are any of the vectors arranged in a grid (i.e. evenly spaced in the x, y, or z dimensions), or are they random data points?
I was messing around with it yesterday and the code no longer works when you simply change it to 'q'
Change the output to f_out and add f_out=f before you do anything 
Code is simply a list of instructions. Read your list of instructions yourself. When you get to the line containing xm, do you know how to implement that instruction? What is the value of xm at that point? Of you don't know, how will Matlab? 
Then you did something wrong while making that change. Matlab doesn't care what you call your variables. 
I am ready to kick your ass
Sorry for the slow response. If one copy of the matrix is 7.6GB and your machine has 8GB of RAM then if there are any temporary or output values your memory has to swap to disk to hold it all. The SSD is massively faster for this. If you run your calculation on the same machine but with something like 32GB of RAM I bet it would be much faster than 10 min. Try using single instead of double, that may help and you may see improvements on the mac too. If you have simple reproduction steps I'd be happy to run it on my 64GB machine just to see what the result is.
What kind of data are you analyzing? Is it all numeric or is there text data? What release are you using?
all numeric, time-series ECU signal data. I'm using 2012b atm because that's what my company supports.
Dude, I'm with you. I post-process radar data. 10's of GBs of data, and MATLAB can just crunch right through it. The longest part of my analysis is getting the data into MATLAB, and then it's go time. 
yeah buddy!
Out of curiosity how are you importing your data? Is it just numeric data?
I posted at length about it a long while back, but this subreddit has a serious superiority complex. The vast majority of posters on here believe that EVERYTHING is a homework problem, when people in industry know that most complex problems are best handled by breaking them down into smaller, digestible problems. These often resemble homework problems. Who would have thought... your studies prepare you for activities in the real world? INCONCEIVABLE! Treat others with respect. Inspire newbies to learn. Realize that it takes as much effort to help as it does to be a snarky keyboard warrior. Only once the general attitude of this subreddit changes will people decide to spend time and post here. Until then, it's most often not worth the frustration.
It's an annoying process of which I have little control. The data comes in a proprietary binary format. I have a tool which converts it into humam readable (I have no ability to modify this tool). This converts the data into CSV format, but dozens of different messages. So the first step (which I do in Perl) is to parse the data into individual messages, and convert the text into numeric data (dates to Julian, enumerated lists into numbers, etc). I them use csvread to get the different messages into MATLAB. The binary starts off as a couple dozen GBs, then balloons into hundreds as it gets put into CSV files, and then back to something reasonable when MATLAB gets it. 
Interesting. Thanks for the great response! What led you to perl for the data parsing?
Ditto
I ended up using this "multiprod" function: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8773-multiple-matrix-multiplications--with-array-expansion-enabled Seems to give me a solid performance increase from the loop-based multiplications
Good question. Probably me Googling "what programming language to use to parse large text files" or something. I regret it now, but converting all my tools would be too much work. 
nice, thanks for sharing!
If you want to interpolate the x value for a given y, Google something like "Matlab interpolate x value for a given y". Instead of using the usual interp1(x,y,xq), you basically swap the arguments, xq = interp1 (y,x,yq). I hope this helps.
Something like [this?](https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/icdf.html?s_tid=gn_loc_drop)
Thanks it does!
Wow...how the hell did you find that damn.
Using this you can specify the 'name' input. For Example 'Normal', 'Poisson' or you can use specific inverse functions for that distribution like [norminv](http://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/norminv.html), [poissinv](https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/poissinv.html).

I'd stop lurking for this, especially if it encouraged different ways to complete the same task: diff algorithms, toolboxes, good coding methods , tempting bad code methods, runnable code in the shape of an ice cream cone, etc.

Try to accomplish some tasks from Codegolf StackOverflow. Don't focus on code shrinking, just try to make your code working. If there is Matlab/Octave solution, compare your solution with the proposed one. You'll learn a lot of techniques to produce an efficient code 
Not being really helpful to you, but I am taking a lot of engineering classes and building a FSAE car, so I keep using Matlab So I stay sharp 
I absolutely agree. But the problem is the data is not getting swapped out at all on the other machine. The memory just fills up entirely and the computer stops responding.
I've done that and it seems to work. But can I ask you a question? I thought to multiply matrices, first matrix has to have the same number of columns as second matrix's rows. I started with it being (1 x 2601) * (2601 x 72). Why wouldn't that work? Doesnt it follow linear algebra's rules? Thanks for your help
You're absolutely correct that matrix multiplication works like that, but in your example, you're performing element-wise multiplication ( .* ), which is very different but straightforward. In element-wise multiplication, you need two matrices (or vectors) of the same size and you just kinda lay them on top of each other to match their elements up and multiply. Go into MATLAB and try it out and let me know if that wasn't clear enough.
thanks so much, I didn't realize its different for elementwise multiplication. one last question: the matrices aren't the same size, so how come MATLAB was able to lay them on top, match their elements up and multiply? is it because they both have 2601 as one of their dimensions?
hello ??
Lmao. Make a code that does task A but you gotta make it look like the Monalisa

Hey there, you can try attending online Matlab courses at Stanford University. It is quite a high level, but nevertheless do not be afraid to check it out: https://www.class-central.com/mooc/9500/stanford-openedx-advanced-matlab-for-scientific-computing?utm_source=quartz&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=new_courses_october
The issue is that a lot of the newbie questions are terrible. They either have titles that are not descriptive, consist only of a copy/past of the homework problem, or don't even have info on what the issue is or what they tried before. 
One way to go about this is to use cellfun and find to extract the locations of whatever from your cel array. Assuming Monster is actually 'Monster" (a character array) you can use this to get their locations from their indices in World [monstersX,monstersY] = find(cellfun(@(contents) strcmp(contents,'Monster'),World)) But, this is quite inefficient. Personally, i would probably use a different data structure to remember where everything is, possibly even side by side if this datastructure is usefull for other purposes. Concider saving the locations of everything in matrices too like: MonsterLocations = [3,7;8,8;7,3] and update that as well as your cell matrix
Does it count that I run "Memes Indexed from 1"? https://www.facebook.com/IndexFrom1/
Are you wondering how to import data from a text file into MATLAB? Look at `dlmread`. 
Why don't you just post your question here, instead of asking for a PM? Just make sure you [follow our rules for posting homework](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/462uwe/submitting_homework_questions_read_this/), especially showing what you've already tried. 
I think the simplest solution would be to keep the player's current location in a two-element vector, like `location = [y,x]`. If the player moves to another tile, you can increment or decrement the corresponding location value to update the user's location. Then you can get the cell corresponding to that index using `World{location(1), location(2)}` to find out what is on the same tile as the player.
If you go on create new variable, I'm sure there's an 'import variable' button somewhere
hmm bruh

There is no style guide for MATLAB like pep8. [MBeautifier](https://github.com/davidvarga/MBeautifier) might suit your needs, though.
It sounds like you've already solved your problem. You have a vector that describes, for each month, DAI. So for each value on the x-axis (0:0.001:100, PS this resolution is really really high) you just need to count how many months are over that value. The total number of months should just be a constant, so after you count how many month exceed that value you just divide by the total number of months to get the fraction of months over that DAI threshold.
I'm trying to code it so that it produces a number for each value of DAI (0.001, 0.002, 0.003,...) so I want to end up with a 10000x1 vector which should exponentially decrease - don't I need a for loop or something for counting? I've played around with the command sum(mymatrixorvector(:)=&gt;n) not really sure how to advance
Im not exactly following you’re explanation here. Could it be you looking for cumsum? Else it would maybe be helpful if you post your code and a sketch of what you exactly want.
As a newbie myself, I really tried to not do these things, but sometimes it's hard to phrase a question correctly when you're so new to something. I agree with you that somethings deserve to be downvotes, but other times ppl should give them the benefit of the doubt and instead of downvoting, telling them why their question sucks can help even if you don't answer their question.
A logical thing to do would be to use a for-loop, yup. I'm sure there is a way to vectorize the process without the need for loops, but a for-loop would certainly work just fine here. Something like: DAI_probe = 0:0.001:100; DAI_data = ...; % monthly data in here y_data = zeros(length(DAI_probe)); for i = 1:length(DAI_probe) threshold = DAI_probe(i); num_months_over_threshold = sum(DAI_data&gt;=threshold); y_data(i) = num_months_over_threshold/length(DAI_data); end This is broken down into the individual steps so I hope you understand.
If it's just points separated by a space you can just use the load function. If it's Nx2, N being the number of points, you just do: figure plot(A(:,1), A(:,2), 'r*')
Alright thank you! I will try that soon and hopefully treat everyone with some beautifully graphed data!
I'm not sure if it makes sense to plot K on that continuous range of values, but can't you just set it as a vector of numbers? Something like K = linspace(0,100); or considering your range from 0 to Inf, a logspace might work better K = logspace(-1,10);
I'm going to agree with everyone else... You shouldn't use a cell array. I would instead suggest a "table" format. E.g., consider: A = table(repmat("Monster",numberOfMonsters,1),randi(10,numberOfMonsters,2)); % initialize table with monsters A.Properties.VariableNames = {'name', 'location'}; A = [A; {"Shield", [3, 4]}]; A = [A; {"Health", [6, 9]}]; ... and so on. Don't forget to figure out a way to make sure you don't put two monsters in the same location, too! Then, after the player moves, you can do a very simply check to see if the player has encountered another object: encounteredObject = find all(playerLocation == A.location,2); % Check if player is at same coordinates as any object in A if A.name(encounteredObject) == "Monster" playerHealth = false; elseif A.name(encounteredObject) == "Health" playerHealth = playerHealth+1; end You can also add other properties to objects in the table, even properties that only some of the objects in the table actually have. For instance, say you want the monsters to have health... A.health = NaN(height(A),1); % Create "health" column and set all values to NaN A.health(A.name=="Monster") = 10; And so on.
The Path is the list of directories that Matlab will first look when you call any functions or try to programmatically open any files. Your current folder, on the other hand, is the current "home base." Any files in the current folder can be accessed/run without issues even if they aren't on your Path. The path is nice because you can add a directory to your path so that you can always call functions from somewhere despite not being in that folder. For example, I have an in-house toolbox of functions that I use for analysis. These functions are stored in a separate folder that is added to my Path whenever I use Matlab. Because they are on my Path, I can call these functions when I'm coding scripts in a different directory.
Path would cause an issue if you have similar file names for different toolkits then. Let's say you have plot.m script in multiple folders and all these folders are on path. How does matlab know which one to take?
Enter the command "path" in the command window and Matlab will return it's current Path. It will go from top to bottom, whichever "plot.m" it finds first, it will use. This is why it's a bad idea to name any custom functions the same as built-ins.
I always considered a *folder change* to be a temporary thing, such as working on a dataset that resides in a particular folder, and a *path addition* to be a more permanent change, such as adding a new toolbox or set of functions to Matlab. However, if you don’t call *savepath*, then the changes will revert upon shutdown. So if you are going to make a function that you will be using Long-term, either save it in the current Matlab path or add/save the enclosing folder to the path. If you have some data that you need to analyze for a class, just change to that folder temporarily, otherwise Matlab will spend time searching through the folder 3 years later when the data is inconsequential.
Look at the structure of k_means_result. Each element tells you which cluster that gene belongs to (i.e., each value will be [1,...,20]). To get the points in cluster 1, just say cluster1 = rand_patient_data(k_means_result==1,:); To get the number of points in cluster 1, just sum up the number of times k_means_result is equal to 1. num_pts_cluster1 = sum(k_means_result==1); To get the center of each cluster, just extract the points and compute the centroid of those coordinates. Or, even better, you could see that [kmeans](https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/kmeans.html) has an optional second output that *is* the centroids of each cluster.
Why would you down vote this question? Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with you, people?
Hey, thanks! That explains a lot. So I'm guessing [indices, centroids_each_cluster] = kmeans(rand_patient_data, 20); gives me the centroids of each cluster? Also, now that I have the clusters (from the first bit of code you gave me), how would I go about plotting them? I did research online and gathered that it would be something like this: plot(cluster1(:,:),'*'); Thanks again! 
That's basically it, although 'plot' probably wouldn't be the best command to use. 'Plot' is typically used for line plots, but in your case, I think 'scatter' would be a better command. Also keep in mind, your clusters are comprised of 20-dimensional data, so you'll need to reduce the dimensionality down to 2 or 3 if you want to use scatter or scatter3 (for a 3d plot). You could do this by: selecting 2 or 3 arbitrary dimensions to visualize (easy) or you could perform PCA analysis to obtain 2 or 3 principle components (actually a simple process in Matlab with the 'pca' command, but would take a bit more effort to implement).
Thanks! I actually do have to do PCA analysis for the assignment as well, so I'll stick to selecting the 2 arbitrary dimensions for now. Would something this suffice? scatter(clusterX(:,1),cluster2(:,2)); 
Hey thanks a bunch, sorry for all the questions. I now have centroids_of_each_cluster (the second output from kmeans). I see that centroids_of_each_cluster is a 20x50 matrix. If I understand you correctly, I can plot this by reducing the dimensions? Would it look something like this? scatter(1:20,centroids_of_each_cluster(:,1)); hold all; scatter(1:20,centroids_of_each_cluster(:,2)); scatter(1:20,centroids_of_each_cluster(:,3)); continuing until I hit the 20th column? 
You just need to create a cell array that holds your data. So your matrix would look like this: A = {'x','y','z','constant1','c2','c3';1,1,21,3242,342,432;2,2...} Of course, manually typing that out wouldn't make sense, so you'll need to decide how to construct this cell array. Once you have it, you just use xlswrite: xlswrite('indexingStartsAt1.xlsx',A);
Close, but the first argument of scatter should be the x-data and the second should be the y-data. The x-coordinate (x: meaning the "first" coordinate out of the 50 dimensions) for the first cluster is centroids_of_each_cluster(1,1). The y-coordinate would be centroids_of_each_csluter(1,2). So to scatter the first and second dimensions for each cluster, it would be: x_data = centroids(:,1); y_data = centroids(:,2); scatter(x_data,y_data); This is a reduction down to two dimensions, and it's totally arbitrary since we don't know which of the 50 dimensions are most important. You could also do something similar for 3D scatter: x_data = centroids(:,1); y_data = centroids(:,2); z_data = centroids(:,3); scatter(x_data,y_data,z_data);
I'm pretty sure rlocus plots the loci for 0&lt;=K&lt; infinity by default.
I think it's because you need to be working with Python floats, not Numpy floats. They can both be used to represent numbers but how the bits are stored is slightly different. I'm not really sure how to fix this in your case but it would make sense that the Python/Matlab API would support Python floats, but not Numpy floats.
This was exactly the problem. I enclosed all parameters in the call to MATLAB with float() and it seems to be running now! Thanks!
Hmm yes, that would work. I'll try and see if I can come up with another way to do this.
Look up interpolating functions (interp1, interp2, etc).
I am looking for something to turn it into continuous function. 
Once you define the interpolated function, it would function like a regular function, where you could plug in values and get outputs, plot, etc. If you are looking for a *pretty* function such as 2x + y^3 then you will need to manually fit a function or use the [curve fitting toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/help/curvefit/curve-fitting.html).
somewhat similarly, an FFT gives the coefficients for an interpolating function using the Fourier Basis functions. personally though, I hate using the Exponential set of basis funtions, Sines and Cosines just made more sense to me. But you should be able to convert the outputs of the FFT to sine/cosine coefficients.
So what's your suggestion? 
really depends on your data. if it's linear, or somewhat polynomial-like, cincymatt's suggestion of using the interp or curve fitting works well. if you're looking at non-polynomial data or working in the Signal Processing field, a Fourier-based approach would work. there's no real magic bullet here. it all depends on your data and the underlying process that generated it.
It's a random signal. 
Using an FFT will give you frequency magnitude/phase information of the signal. You can then - with a little legwork - use this information to reconstruct the signal using sine/cosine functions. 
don’t use excel. that’s a terrible idea. you don’t want your data in a proprietary binary format. use writetable, which handles headers just fine, and then can be imported using readtable 
i think there’s a troll in the sub who gets off on downvoting every single question 
You can write the solution to: Xdot=Ax As X=x_o*exp(A*t) Since in general solving exp(A*t) is hard you can sometimes write: A=V*D*V^-1 Where V is the matrix of eigenvectors and D=diag(eigenvalues) So then (you can prove this part to yourself); X=x_o*V*exp(D*t)*V^-1 Which is much easier to compute since exp(D) just equals diag(exp(eigenvalues)) So now it should be simple to solve in Matlab. Hope that helps! 
if it's random, you're probably not going to want to do an interpolation. can you share an image?
It's decay over time and has a definite shape. 
Take a look at polyfit. Technically speaking, your fitting a curve to your data, not the other way around.
The solution is actually `x(t) = exp(A t) x_0`, not `x_0 exp(A t)`. You cannot do the second multiplication, since the matrix dimensions do not match. And be sure to use matlab's `expm` function to do the calculation, if you do not use eigenvalue decomposition.
Thanks! You're right. I rushed my answer and put the scalar case where it doesn't matter.
Well, in the scalar case, you would also not need to do a eigenvalue decomposition. 😀
your for loop is completely incorrect. you can not have a number as a changing variable.
It's a typo. this is literally pseudo code i plopped here
well your for loop is just overwriting the data all the time. why not concatenate the output of all iterations of your functions into one array, and then use frptinf one time to write that whole array to your file?
besides... your for loop index doesn't even return in your for loop? what do you expect the for loop to do exactly, what is m?
Takes up too much memory. The idea is to take z1, update with myFunc to z2, save z2, then feed z2 back in as z1. z1 given; z2 = myFunc(z1); z2 to file; z1 = z2;
If for all intents and purposes, the loop updates z,z2 under myFunc m times. There is no explicit dependence of this on the index i, but it is implicit as an updated global variable k(i) used in computation of myFunc(). Like I said, this is pseudo code which is meant to discuss fprintf and fopen. 
That makes sense, is the MATLAB table format readable by anything else though? 
I found a way to solve this, using "pcolor" pcolor(erroralpha) % erroralpha is a 10x10 matrix colorbar set(gca, 'Ytick', 1:2:10, 'YtickLabels', round(alpharun(1:2:10),3)) xlabel('d') ylabel('\alpha value')
dlmwrite('FILENAME',M,'-append')
sorry for the late update, but this sounds like a problem for a which a while loop would be much better suited m = 10; index = 1; while index &lt;= m (whatever process you want) index = index + 1 end i'm not very familiar with fprintf, and have no time to actually open matlab right now, but i think you might have to use fopen and fclose in every iteration of the loop. but as i said, for this kind of problem i would concatenate vectors. matlab is literally suitable for working with 1 000 000x1 vectors. m = 10; index = 1; while index &lt;= m z1 = myFunc(z) vector(:,1) = z1 z = z1 index = index + 1 end then print that vector to your file.
Are you sure you dont want to fit it to a paraforka? or a paraknivea? or a parasoupa?
cftool
Thank you for constructive feedback. 
Writetable is basically a .csv with whatever separator you want. You can then read it with pretty much anything (Excel, python, tikz).
you are so welcome.
Since it looks like you are on fire today, maybe you could provide some more wisdom? 
That's what I was using, however since I also have several large matrices, I end up with 4 different .csv files and I was trying to just slim that down a little. I think I may have it working with a .xls now though, I'll update the OP if it ends up working.
I cannot. Good luck though!
Haha, well, when you're right you're right!
This is a fairly straightforward function, I don't have my Matlab available right now, but hopefully this helps. I assume you have looked at the [documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/map/ref/circcirc.html)? Granted it is a bit short, but has all the info you need. As far as defining the circles using the six parameters goes, first you provide the center of circle1, in Cartesian coordinates, that is your x1, y1. Then you give the radius of circle1 as r1, this is in Cartesian units as well. You do the same for circle2, but use x2, y2, and r2.
Please, could you find it in your heart - the world needs your insight, wisdom and help!
perun1_16 doesn't have "lat" as one of its variables. Try latp maybe? Have no idea where you're getting that struct so can't tell you which variable to use instead. Use something like: names = fieldnames(perun1_16) to see the list of field names in that struct. Depending on your requirement you can filter geographical data in two increasingly complex ways. A) remove all lats/lons using some fixed range. Assuming you have an estimated min/max latitudes of Poland as y_min/y_max and min/max longitudes of Poland as x_min/x_max: idx_lats = find(lats &lt; y_max &amp;&amp; lats &gt; y_min); new_lats = lats(idx_lats); new_lons = lons(idx_lats); idx_lons = find(new_lons &lt; x_max &amp;&amp; new_lons &gt; x_min); new_lats = new_lats(idx_lons); new_lons = new_lons(idx_lons); There's likely a more efficient way of doing the above but I'm writing this out on my phone so that's good enough for now I think to filter within some range. B) If you have access to a shapefile/KML of Poland's area and you want to get a bit more fancy with your filtering. You'd take your points, check if they are inside Poland's area and filter out those that aren't. You could likely do this by: 1. Using [this](https://www.mathworks.com/help/map/ref/shaperead.html) or [this](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/35642-kml2struct) to extract the Poland polygon from the shapefile/kml. 1. Test which of your points are inside the polygon using [inpolygon](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/inpolygon.html). I hope that helps. Won't be able to reply for a while so good luck! 
Have you done absolutely nothing to try to the problem? Where are you struggling? As of now you've just copy and pasted the question without showing what you've figured out so far.
1) Take some time to actually write out a coherent post. 2) Are you struggling with using ode45 and setting conditions in general, or are you specifically asking how to construct that piecewise function?
rng(6039); n = 2; %number obs N = 3; %number of simulations mu = 0; sigma = 1; Epsilon = normrnd(mu,sigma, n ,1); beta0 = 2; beta1 = -2; p = 10; N = 5; succesRate = zeros(1,N); nIndex = (1:N); for j = (1:N) n = nIndex(j); disp(strcat('Simulating for n = ', num2str(n))) upper = zeros(1,p); lower = zeros(1,p); for i = (1:p) X = normrnd(mu, sigma, n, 1); Y= beta0 + beta1.*X(p) + Epsilon(p).*X(p); upper(i) = mean(X)+1.96*sx/sqrt(n); lower(i) = mean(X)-1.96*sx/sqrt(n); end Ind = (lower &lt;= beta1) &amp; (beta1 &lt;= upper); succesRate(j) = sum(Ind)/N.sim; end plot(nIndex, succesRate); ylim([0,1]) xL = get(gca,'XLim'); line(xL, [0.95 0.95],'Color','r'); that's what I have done so far...
What don't you understand about the syntax? It's a relatively simple function, the input arguments are just the coordinates of the two circles and their radii.

I am having some trouble with the double for loop. rng(6039); n = 2; %number obs N = 3; %number of simulations mu = 0; sigma = 1; Epsilon = normrnd(mu,sigma, n ,1); beta0 = 2; beta1 = -2; p = 10; N = 5; succesRate = zeros(1,N); nIndex = (1:N); for j = (1:N) n = nIndex(j); disp(strcat('Simulating for n = ', num2str(n))) upper = zeros(1,p); lower = zeros(1,p); for i = (1:p) X = normrnd(mu, sigma, n, 1); Y= beta0 + beta1.X(p) + Epsilon(p).X(p); upper(i) = mean(X)+1.96sx/sqrt(n); lower(i) = mean(X)-1.96sx/sqrt(n); end Ind = (lower &lt;= beta1) &amp; (beta1 &lt;= upper); succesRate(j) = sum(Ind)/N.sim; end plot(nIndex, succesRate); ylim([0,1]) xL = get(gca,'XLim'); line(xL, [0.95 0.95],'Color','r'); that's what I have done so far... I am having some trouble making the double for loop and also understanding how to include the standard errors (robust &amp; classical) thanks
&gt; Are you struggling with using ode45 and setting conditions in general, or are you specifically asking how to construct that piecewise function? the specific function. dont know how to write the conditions to work for ode45 like the more than and less than parts. is for a friend so i dont understand it 
Please also see how to format your code so it's readable. 
Hey there, I have bought it and its very very basic, you dont learn too much. You can try free Stanford University course, which is high level, but self paced and informative. You can find it in my post history as I am on mobile now and cant post the link 😀
so do I say something like: x1=4, y1=4, r1=5 x2=0,x2=0, r2=9. Or do I write a function of a circle using the "@"
Hi! Thanks very much for the advice, I'll give the Sandford courses a go as well... since the post I found out that PhD students have full access to all MATLAB training courses so I'm going to do that too! Thank you again for the advice! 
doesn't work. it puts the first part call of this to the file, but the other m calls are not put in. thanks for this function though. ill keep this one in mind
No worries, would like to hear feedback on your future 😀 Goodluck!
Why don't you try it yourself and see what happens. Report back to us what you find.
I'm confused. Did you not read the documentation? 
Why not write to mat files? They're way more space efficient and faster. 
mat files? I'm using .txt files to then import them into mathematica where I use the tools I am much more familiar with for graphics.
Okay so i found a hint maybe! When i let him show me the list "alle_x" after a while NaN start to pop up: No fucking idea why though 0 0 -1 0 -1 -1 -1 -2 0 -2 0 -1 0 -2 1 -2 2 -2 2 -3 3 -3 4 -3 5 -3 5 -2 5 -1 4 -1 4 -2 4 -3 5 -3 4 -3 5 -3 5 -4 6 -4 6 -5 5 -5 4 -5 4 -4 4 -5 3 -5 3 -4 4 -4 4 -3 4 -4 4 -5 4 -4 4 -3 3 -3 3 -4 3 -3 3 -2 2 -2 3 -2 4 -2 3 -2 4 -2 5 -2 5 -3 5 -2 6 -2 6 -3 6 -4 6 -3 6 -2 6 -3 5 -3 5 -2 6 -2 5 -2 5 -1 4 -1 3 -1 4 -1 4 0 4 -1 4 -2 4 -3 4 -2 4 -1 3 -1 3 0 3 -1 2 -1 3 -1 3 -2 4 -2 4 -1 NaN -1 NaN -2 NaN -2 NaN -1 NaN 0 NaN 0 NaN 0 NaN 1 NaN 1 NaN 1 NaN 0 NaN 0 NaN -1 NaN 0 NaN 0 NaN 1 NaN 0 NaN -1 NaN -2 NaN -3 NaN -4 NaN -4 NaN -4 NaN -4 NaN -4 
Your code is very convoluted for a relatively simple process. Is the location where NaN starts the same place where the first 0 in pi is? Just by eyeballing it seems like it. 
I would love a better explaination of the code (I don't understand what the aim is), but the code completes after removing the whitespace that you have in the 'aa' string. It plots the fat red dot and line. Use isnan and a breakpoint to check the condition for the error. I suspect it's whitespace in the string.
Damn you were right. I did not even see that. Thanks a lot!! And yeah sorry for the bad code, its my second time with matlab ever...
I tested your code, and it works fine. I added m, but like you said it was pseudo code. The file MATLAB generates just keeps on piling the values. %z is given z = randi([1,10],1,3); fileID = fopen('textfile.txt','at+'); fprintf(fileID, '%f\r\n', z); m=2; for i=1:m z1 = randi([1,10],1,3); %myFunc(z); fprintf(fileID, '%f\r\n', z1); z = z1; end fclose(fileID); The file has: 1.000000 4.000000 2.000000 8.000000 4.000000 ... Are you still having issues? Option1: your m isn't actually &gt;= 1. In which case, the loop won't even loop once. Option2: your Func() returns an empty matrix instead of what you think?
very interesting! :) 
I personally can't even read your screenshot. But, before you code this, have you solved on paper the parallel and perpendicular components? I can help code if you have that math done. :) 
Nvm, I figured it out haha 
Most people are usually willing to help with homework here, giving tips and hints when people provide their problem but you've just given me the fucking homework with zero effort on your part. Fuck you.
Not expert on this yet. Is there a reason your function's lines 6-18 are in this file and not a file on its own called fourierSeries.m? Then come back in this lovely .m file and run. Typically, that's how we build functions.
(also. you do realize the f***.m word appears not only in the error message, but also in the editor's blue bar, right?) 
I thought so! I’m sure OP did as well, and he’s too busy enjoying his docked windows to return.
awww. unless he/she's still drowning under the undocked windows. :) 
what version are you using? your Fourier Series function is a "local" one, meaning it's a function that lives within that file. Your f***.m is a script, meaning it's just a bunch of commands that will populate your workspace. Earlier versions of Matlab did not support the use of local functions within a script; you were only able to use the local functions in other functions. Try taking your fourierSeries function and moving it to its own m-file and see if you still get that error. 
I made a test file, and the same type of format gave stacked arrays just how I wanted. I'm printing three files now--the actual stuff in the original file, the stuff in a file declared inside the loop, and the index of the loop. If the second doesnt show up but the third does, then the problem is with myFunc() and the differences between my computer and the server on which it is running. myFunc() takes in an array of numbers representing spatial and orientation variables and returns either an energy, gradient, and hessian, or just an energy and gradient. the test file uses the full 3 returns while my personal one uses the 2 returns. the code would actually look more like options declared here z = fminunc(myFunc(z'), options); z' = z; z to file; inside the loop
Woah, relax. I already figured it out :)
so.. you still have questions.. or just tagging along... not sure from what you wrote. "I'm printing 3 files now --... the index of the loop"? So you have a file with 1,2,3,4,... last index? it's interesting. Check the workspace to see what comes out of the functions (when you can). Omit the semi-colon to see stuff happening inside a function. 
I think it just hit me what you were trying to say. You're printing 3 things in the file. The original data (from above the loop), then the stuff inside the loop.. but you separate each output by showing which loop count you're on. Good idea!
as a heads up, I've NEVER seen a MATLAB function ALLCAPS.. so FPLOT() is interesting. 
It was a good idea! No new files were created.... so the first iteration of the loop fails before i print to the files. This is mighty interesting. I cannot debug on this because i am working on the console directly into servers which has no matlab GUI, so it is giving no error feedback.
Is there a reason you do 'at+'?, vs. just 'w'. Since you open at the top, and close at the bottom, the 'w' would overwrite the old run file but add to the end as it goes anyways. if you are running on a server, do you have write/append permission? 
another random thought. your myFunc() doesn't accidentally close any opened file, right? It's not like you pass the fileID anyways, but maybe a command that just gets rid of the pointer somehow?
thanks a lot for your help, it's the first time i use matlab. I'm using the latest version, so it's weird it doesn't let me use local functions within a script. Also, what is the right way to plot this? every tutorial see uses some different code...subplot, ezplot, fplot
hahahah did not notice it
I'm also kind of in a hurry to finish with this fourier work for school, so any extra help would be appreciated ♥
thanks a lot for your help, it's the first time i use matlab. I'm using the latest version, so it's weird it doesn't let me use local functions within a script. Also, what is the right way to plot this? every tutorial see uses some different code...subplot, ezplot, fplot
nah, it has not accessing external files in it
sorry. not much help on those. most plot require a vector of x values, then y values as their arguments. plot(x,y); the only variables that could even been considered to plot here are n and f so maybe plot(n,f); I did Fourier transforms at least 10yrs ago, and I don't remember much. The doc for fplot() says this: fplot(f) plots the curve defined by the function y = f(x) over the default interval [-5 5] for x. which is what you're doing by only writing 1 argument in fplot()... suplot() just allows you to have multiple little plots in the same figure (like the doc shows). never used ezplot() but again, I'm sure the doc says something with x and y. Give it a shot. Good luck. I'm out for the night.
darn. lol
yes i have perms. i at+ to append later and not simply overwrite each time i add to it... unless the fopen covers fprintf for all time before i close it? 
Alright thank you so much for your answers, I know you are out for the night now but if by chance you get to read this I would appreciate if you could tell me if this way to call the function is correct now: https://imgur.com/a/YViKs

Yes. Once it's open to write... all the fprintf with that file ID will dump the data in the file, one after the other.. until it hits close. The only time is if you ran the same file again, then the w would overwrite the file you created the first time you ran the file. 
Well damn How is that functionally different than at+ though?
Not much. W would overwrite each time you ran the script. At+ would keep appending daily, weekly, monthly... to the same file. Perfect for logbooks for example. 
&gt; dlmwrite('FILENAME',M,'-append') im using that at the moment and it seems to be doing the trick
Yup. Saw that earlier. Should work perfectly fine too. :) Anyways. Gotta go!
thanks for the tips and stuff
If you are including a function anywhere in a Matlab script, then the first line of the m file needs to be a function definition. Here's how i would try to fix it. function fuck() func=600; Etc. end function fourierSeries(args) Etc. end 
that would not actually provide a fit as the X value is not of interest. Basically what I want to do is take a previously defined set of y values describing my curve and then measure the goodness of fit of that curve to any set of y values that I feel inclines with the same number of x values.
What version are you using? I think this is a fairly recent feature, 2017 definitely has it, possibly 2016 as well? I didn't have to do anything to enable it when I updated.
That must be it I guess. I am currently using R2014a so it should definitely be a new feature. Thanks for the info! 
Thank-you for the answer, I have used the second method you have suggested and have managed to define which data points lie outside the shapefile polygon. Regarding the initial error, it was because the data was named perun1_16.latitude and perun1_16.longitude (rather than .lat and .lon). Here is the current structure of my code: % Define polygon: [in,on] = inpolygon(perun1_16.latitude, perun1_16.longitude, S.Lat, S.Lon) numel(perun1_16.latitude(in)) numel(perun1_16.latitude(on)) numel(perun1_16.latitude(~in)) % shapefile: h = worldmap([48 57], [13 26]) S = shaperead('POL_adm0.shp', 'UseGeoCoords', true); geoshow(h, S, 'Facecolor',[0.5 0.8 0.7]) plotm(perun1_16.latitude(in), perun1_16.longitude(in), 'r.') However, I would like to now edit my dataset in one more additional way. The structure file containing the lightning latitude and longitude also comes with other data such as day, month, voltage , etc. I would like to turn all 'perun1_16.latitude' and 'perun1_16.longitude', as well as all the corresponding lightning data into NaN if they lie outside my polygon (I will then filter out all the NaN's; however, this is a process I am confident in doing). Here is a script I have tried coming up with to filter data for the month of January: perun.latitude(~in) = nan; perun.longitude(~in) = nan; for n = 1:length(perun.latitude) if isnan(perun1_16.latitude(n)) perun1_16.longitude(n) = nan; perun1_16.day(n) = nan; perun1_16.month(n) = nan; end end Whilst this does indeed work, I have about 20 other different corresponding data for the latitude and longitude of the lightning strike. Is there a more efficient way of formulating my script and can I also script this to loop over all 12 months (as my script currently is just for January).
What do you mean by "median curve" here?
See attached picture, I mean a line that represents the point cloud. See picture, sorry for the bad quality, I'm not at my desk With median curve I mean the red line: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ju54cyhryjkvizv/Foto%2017.11.17%2C%2016%2018%2002.png?dl=0 I think i need to segment the point cloud, in small Intervalls and calculate for each Intervall the median ... but I'm not sure
Why median and not mean?
Mean is also possible, for me, in other models i used median because it gives information about the distribution. In this specific case both is possible 
Just click on the screen on blank space and it will show small magnifying glass and then type the name of the block you want to add to your model and it will list all available options and just select and press enter to add it. In your case it might be one of the following issue: #1 Either Simulink is not detecting your click or #2 Your spelling the block wrong
Yeah you just need to compute the rolling average, or rolling median over your data. Define how wide you want your window to be and shift it across the data; at each point compute the median in that range 
With newer Releases you simply use MOVMEDIAN https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/movmedian.html Over your x &amp; y coords
So you've stumbled across a problem that sounds easier than it is (and is much easier for a human than a computer to do). The reason is, it's easy to look at that data and understand where the "line" goes, but you have to think of a way to define that mathematically. Here's why: Look at the first part of your curve. There, you want to find the average x-value over some y-range. But in the middle, that definition doesn't make sense anymore. Now, you need to find some average y value as you change x values- and through the curves you'd want to compute medians over points on an angle. Basically, you need a way to define a "direction" of your curve at any point. MATLAB has tools which can help you do these calculation- but until you rigorously define what you want to do, there's no way for MATLAB to do it either. 
As of MATLAB 2016b you can have function directly in your script files no longer needing them to be in their own .m file like you're describing. If I was doing a quick prototype or script I'd do it this way. If I was making a package or something for distribution I'd do it like you're describing.
Your problem might be that line of white space after the end of the function. Have you tried removing that? edit: I'm sure this is your problem. Remove anything after the "d" in end. Any spaces, any new lines, any tabs (All white space).
As of 2016b what you're saying is no longer the case. You can now add your local functions to the bottom of a script file. 
Whooooo, THANK YOU!!!! movmedian is a great thing, i didn't know this exists! Great Help, Thank you very much.
Thank you for your answer, as @LordFckHelmchen mentioned there is a command for this in 2017 version, this does exactly what i was searching. Now i can adjust my older code, great command, im very happy now
interesting!! so, I'll google this weekend.. but what is the name of the file then.. functions have to match the filename.. but if a function is in a script.. who's what? :)
No problem. I'm still interested in knowing what the issue was .
yup. that looks right. no orange warning anywhere. (now, as far as the inside of the function and the math.. no can help. :)
Name the file whatever you want. It's just a script file. But now you can put local functions at the end of the file. The filename=functionName was just so Matlab knew where to look for functions. Now it checks your current script file before your working directory etc... I don't need around with the command window much so I'm not sure (guess it's not) if the function is available in the command window.
Start programming it and come back with specific problems you run into.
just tried it. very cool. thanks.
Thanks for nothing 
No one here is going to do your homework for you. You didn't give a question other than "this is what it needs to do, how do I do it?" We're a lot more likely to help if you show that you tried. 
You can try using the [gramm](https://github.com/piermorel/gramm) toolbox for this. You can use stat_smooth() which is a spline smoothing and should be close to the "mean curve" you want (look at the examples or the cheat sheet). It will do the plot automatically and you'll also get a confidence area. If you have more than one curve (with a variable that defines which point belongs to which category), gramm will shine as it will allow to automatically make curves of different colors, or separated in different subplots, etc.
i think the big thing you should focus on is getting the logic down for calculating the scores. the things you listed above, while necessary, are super basic and you'll be able to get those done quickly. Calculating the score, however, is much more complicated from an algorithmic standpoint. next, you'll need to figure out how a user's going to put information in. the easiest is to prompt them for a (row, column) input. if you're going to go with a GUI, it should be pretty easy to incorporate the above. check this out for a good introduction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiQn9CYbALY&amp;list=PLPhi9dVsEVfZOlbIPsrQx0drJlBX9T15r if you're new to Matlab, i'd recommend avoiding the GUI for now. if you're a bit more experienced, it may save you some integration time by starting with it. regardless, focus on the scoring algorithm for the board as it's going to be the most difficult part IMO. 
have you implemented the recognition part in Matlab yet? What exactly are you looking for help with?
[removed]
Sorry, let me be clear. Professor said no toolboxes were allowed, we are to make code that has the computer record audio it then compares to several templates to get a phrase match. Then it outputs based on the phrase. The key here is, he wants it to be constantly listening for a command. I do not know how to make it continuously listen. My initial idea is while loops, but I'm not sure.
I was thinking maybe somehow saving an interval of time as a .wav and using xcorr on that. But this wouldnt work if the command was at the end of one clip and beginning of another, as it would be cut in two and xcorr would give low similarity.
Boom, good call dude, I didn't know this function existed either.
thank you , much appreciated I️ will look into what you suggested
hint: you're looking for the lower triangle of a matrix.
How are you receiving the audio to be analyzed? In order to actively listen for key words you need access to a microphone. If it is on your computer then you need to produce an algorithm that activates your mic for an indefinite period of time, waiting for new input. I am currently working on a project that does something similar. However we are not look looking for key phrases. We are looking for animal audio signals. We have a microphone that actively listens, We then load a small buffer and run a 1024 point FFT and check for a for specific frequencies relative to our animal and then if we find a similar perform the recognition algorithm for confirmation. So my suggestion is, perhaps produce a small buffer. It can be short, or it can be long. like 3-5 seconds. If it detects a signal in the 3-5 seconds run your algorithm if not, start again. Also i do not know how you are doing your recognition but here is a resource we have been utilizing that has become very useful to us. https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/32849-htk-mfcc-matlab?requestedDomain=www.mathworks.com 
We are comparing xcorr graphs of inputs to our known signals and giving an output based on a match. So there is a way to make the microphone run indefinitely? I was thinking id have to continuously save the recording in 2 blocks that overlap slightly and analyze each block for the key. I can give more detail on this if needed
Can you go into more detail on what you mean by 2 blocks that overlap. What is it that you want these 2 blocks that overlap to achieve. At the moment I can't of a more clever way of having the mic run continuous other than using a loop. If you take that approach just make sure to include some function to break the loop whenever you want to do something else. Like if key press stop mic record. But for the xcorr graphs I think in order to make the comparison be more robust you will need to consider when your new input signal is not as long as your control signal. You can overcome this with windowing. Lets say your input signal is 2 seconds but your control signal is 5 seconds. If you compared the xcorr graph flat out you would find a similarity.. if they are "lined" up properly, but that wont solve your problem. So you will need to develop an algorithm to "slide" this 2 second segment across the 5 seconds and check for a match. You as the coder will need to decide what is the minimum length of your input segment needed to identify a match even if the whole phrase or word is not present.
I think the problem is with the version I have. I guess that feature is rather new and MatLab/Simulink 2014 doesnt have it. Thanks for the reply!
Thank you your suggestion, I will look into this! I had a quick look and it looks very capable!! 
is it for students only?
Hi man. I'm so sorry for the late reply. You were right; I was being an idiot. The thing was working as intended: I was looking for something else and a vector approach wasn't working so I had to revert back to 1001x1001 and meshgrid to get an actual 3d shape. Thanks for the help though, really appreciate it. 
Hi man. So sorry for being 4 days late to reply when you were trying to help. I've sorted it out. The thing I plotted was working as intended, but it wasn't what I was looking for so I had to change my approach entirely. Thank you for reaching out though. Very much appreciated
Okay it seems like I can do it in the normal workspace, but when I try doing it in the App Designer it won't let me.
I think I found the problem but I don't understand it.. [X,Y] = meshgrid(-10:1:10,-10:1:10); f = @(x,y) x*y; Z = f(X,Y); surf(X,Y,Z) When I make my function, f, x*y, I get a flat plane but if I do y*x I get it the way it looks in google.. Seems very weird for me, might be something with x and y axis swapping but I can'tt figure it out
&gt;I think I found the problem but I don't understand it.. &gt; &gt; [X,Y] = meshgrid(-10:1:10,-10:1:10); &gt; f = @(x,y) x*y; &gt; Z = f(X,Y); &gt; surf(X,Y,Z) &gt; &gt;When I make my function, f, x*y, I get a flat plane but if I do y*x I get it the way it looks in google.. Seems very weird for me, might be something with x and y axis swapping but I can'tt figure it out You don't need to write a function &gt; [X,Y] = meshgrid(-10:1:10,-10:1:10); &gt; Z = X.*Y; &gt; surf(X,Y,Z) 
Okay thank you very much for your help! Now when I write my function I write as you do, X.*Y and it works as it should. Now when I try to write "./" instead it says: "'Value' must be a double scalar within the range of 'Limits'" I just don't understand why this happens with dividing and google is able to plot it..
I can do with your code, just writing Z = X./Y, but my app gives me that error.. And my limits is -Inf to Inf..
Never mind I fixed it, thank you very much. The problem was my resultbox tried to show a NaN value which it wasn'tt able too.
You can curve fit whatever you want if you transform the data rather than the plot axes.

Wut 
For 2, even though I don't like it you can use the symbolic toolbox. and then use a loop through loop through the values for a and plot them all. Otherwise you can just write it out manually by hand (which I recommend) and then just do all the coding afterwards. For 3. For I would generate the hilter matrix with a loop again while looping through 2 to 10 and then find the minimal and maximal values of the eigenvalues. And then just plot those. Also look at the semilogy() and hold() functions in the documentation for your plotting needs.

This is awesome, thanks for sharing! 
Thanks for liking it! There are few places to share my bursting enthusiasm for exactly solved mechanical vibrations, so I'm glad there's this sub.
Groovy
Hey, that's pretty cool :) Do you mind sharing your code with us? I I'd love to see what's going on.
This is not quite about the matlab aspect of your post, but if you need precise timing, you should consider using the hardware trigger. It does indeed require another device to send the trigger to the camera, but it is the way that precise timing is typically done. 
And how is this achieved? I don't remember seeing any "trigger" port on the camera, although I do remember it says something about supporting hardware trigger. Could that device be a 555 based timer triggered by the Arduino that is already interfaced with Matlab?
It says where the trigger should be input in the technical manual, around page 140. I just looked it up. You probably have to do some soldering. The arduino should be able to put out the trigger if needed. You just have to find out what kind of trigger the camera needs (if it's ttl etc). 
For 2: for a=[32, 31.9, 31.8, 32.1, 32.2] A = [ -6 28 21; 4 -15 -12; -8 a 25]; % Eigenvalues fprintf('Eigenvalues for a=%.1f', a); eig(A,'vector') % Define t as a symbolic variable syms t; % Get the characterical Polynomial p = @(t) det(A-t*eye(size(A))); % Plot hold on; fplot(p(t),[-1 4]); hold off; end 
that is, take the log of the x and y data, and do regular fitting on that. Then you can use the power of math to derive the relations for the original data from the functions on the log data
WAIT. *Exactly solved???* You mean to say you didn't use an iterative numerical method for this?
Reminds me of making structures in World of Goo on the Wii
Hey, it kinda does. They probably just used physics steps, but for video games that's usually plenty.
Hey, thanks for the interest! I have to wait until the due date of the school project this is for, so I'll post it here in about ten days. I'll add a high level overview of what I did/functions used when I get to sit down somewhere.
idk if you (or anyone else) is still interested in making this work, but I would try this: first, for a simple fix, try adding the following line in your main loop before the call to fprintf: fseek(fileID,0,'eof'); % navigate to the end of the file if that doesnt work, try this: function myfprint(fileID,z) %%writes values to the file one by one. for nn=1:numel(z) fseek(fileID,0,'eof'); % navigate to the end of the file to ensure you dont overwrite anything fprintf(fileID, '%f\r\n',z(nn)) % append a single value to the end of the file end end then, in your main function: for ii=1:m z1=myFunc(z); myfprintf(fileID,z1) z=z1; end
Is there any way to extract the fundamental modes of vibrations? Does that even make sense? Sorry I haven't had any formal education on vibes.
As much as I completely understand how much of a pain in the ass writing a good I/O function for proprietary data can be, it really might be worthwhile. I deal frequently with binary data using a non-standard (but open source) format, and have spent quite a bit of time working on a good data I/O tool (since the ones available for Matlab were sooo slow). Im still tweaking it, but Im able to read/write at close to 200 MB/s (and I think Im being limited by an older sandy-bridge gen system on going faster - it wouldnt surprise me if on a modern state of the art system I could fully saturate the SATA bandwidth, and possibly exceed it with a pcie drive). Just to give you an idea of the speed you might be able to expect if you directly loaded the binary data into Matlab - if it starts out as a couple of GB's it should be 30 seconds or less, a minute tops (unless some really funky stuff has to happen to load the data). The key Ive found with reading binary data quickly is to read it all with as few calls as possible to fread and then (if necessairy) go back and typecast the binary dump to get the values you need. This can be rather tedious to get right, but by implementing this and a blocking analysis to minimize the number of fread function calls my code it 20-30x faster than the other I/O codes for matlab I found (which could literally require millions of calls to fread, since they called fread every time the data type changed).

&gt; Any recommendations of awesome built in functions for analyzing data? Im a big fan of [bsxfun]https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/bsxfun.html), which should be available in your version of matlab. The only downside is that it can require a bit of memory (which can be particularly troublesome for big data - Ive accidentally applied bsxfun at the wrong time and had spikes that caused the machine I was using to dip into swap space even though it had &gt;500gb of ram), though in these scenarios bsxfun still usually works wellas long as you use it in a more limited more limited sense (e.g., instead of replacing a triple nested loop with a single bsxfun call, keep the outermost loop and replace the inner 2 with a bsxfun call). In terms of efficiency, bsxfun seems to be respectably close to matrix operations (which is pretty damn impressive, since matrix operations in Matlab use BLAS/LAPACK from intel's MKL library and are absurdly efficient).
That makes a whole lot of sense, that's exactly what's going on actually. From the equations of motion of the system, I obtain its natural frequencies and fundamental modes. The solution is then a superposition of those modes which depends on the initial conditions (displacement, speed).
Precisely! That's the beauty of it! Basically, once you solve the eigenproblem obtained from the equations of motion of the system, you can get your modes and modal frequencies. By superposing those you can get an exact solution for the motion of every coordinate, according to your initial conditions. This only works for undamped systems, if there is damping the maths are slightly more involved, since the ODE is harder to solve.
So, in a step-by-step format: * I solve the equation of motion of each coordinate by hand (I only need to do it for a single mass since the system is symmetric and floors are repeated). * I get the mass and spring constant matrices into matlab, and solve the resulting eigenproblem with eig() * The eigenvalues and eigenvectors obtained are respectively the frequencies and modes of vibration of my system, so I can use the modes to decouple my equations of motion (only works because this is an undamped system). * From there I end up with a bunch of easily solved ODE's which are gonna want initial conditions to get values for the obtained constants. Plug those in to get the solution to the ODE's and each of your decoupled equation of motion is basically solved. * Then, just gotta superpose all your modes of vibration for each coordinate to get your motion in coordinate space. * From there, I just get the position for a range of times and plug those into plot() a bunch. Then I just getframe every step and use VideoWriter to make an .avi.
Here's the problem I am having. I have two functions where one provides a value, gradient, and hessian of an objective function and the other only supplies the value and gradient. From here, we put in a starting guess, $x_0$. Then we run fminunc() options = optimoptions(@fminunc,'Algorithm','quasi-newton','Display','iter','MaxIterations',1000,'SpecifyObjectiveGradient',true,'OptimalityTolerance', 1e-4); [x,eneq,exitflag,output] = fminunc('func_with_en_grad',$x_0$,options); Then clear relevant stuff to not overuse variables. options = optimset('Display','iter','MaxIter',1000,'GradObj','on','Hessian','on','TolFun', 1e-6); [x2] = fminunc('func_with_en_grad_hess',$x_0$,options); When ran on my local machine, these both yield actual solutions and print to files no problem. However, this exact same code when moved to the department computers used for harder computations gives: x = 0 vector, x2 = the same as before. I narrowed the problem down from printing in for loops to simply printing anything nonzero at all! Is there some incompatibility with the options I am using? IE are they from different versions?
You should create a gif representing each single mode! I think it would be a lot easier to see.
I actually have an intern working on one right now. I don't know why, but for some reason the initial drop he gave me is slow. Painfully, painfully slow. I'm going to have to sit down with him and try to figure out what he's doing wrong. But his program instantly uses all of my RAM when I give him a file that's like 30 MB of binary data. It can't even run on a full sized file. Thanks for the tips. I'll try to use them when I sit down with his code when I get some time. 
The rule I use is "Do I want a number as my output, or do I want an equation as my output?" If your final answer is a number- don't touch the symbolic toolbox. Symbolic variables are not only slow, but also a lot of MATLAB's best functions don't work with them. If what you want at the end is an equation, well then I still don't use the symbolic toolbox, I use Mathematica. Basically this comes down to my rule- use tools how they were designed. MATLAB was designed for numerical analysis. Mathematica is designed for symbolic math. They both struggle doing the other thing.

Oh, I didn't even consider visualising the individual modes! That's a great idea, I'll implement that today. I'll open source the code right after the due date of the school project this was made for, in ten days. Is there an usual way to do this, like an official matlabopensourcecode.com?
That's radical, dude. Far out, I dig it
help while help switch
Have you heard of github? Lots of people open source their code there. You have a profile and your code will be available for people to see, and make better, make alterations, etc. Great website. Or you can just post it on Reddit in a text post
You should post how you solved it. Other people may stumble upon this post in the future with the same problem looking for a solution
I thought about it but it's not really relevant. If they're trying to accomplish what I asked in the OP, then this thread will point them in the right direction. Unfortunately I was being a dumbass and my whole approach was wrong, as in, the original post is not what I should have been doing at all for my piece of work. So the approach in itself isn't wrong per se, it was wrong for my purposes 
kk No worries. Just thought it might be worth letting you know about. Cheers,
Ah, for some reason I didn't consider people might use github for Matlab, but that makes sense, I'll get it on mine for sure.
Just to clarify, when you say "the next value that is &gt;=0.5" do you mean that you look through both a and b starting at the index where you just were and see where you encounter the first 0.5? If so, you can use the find command to get you all of the indices of values that are greater than 0.5: find(a&gt;=0.5) You can then more easily just compare the indices where this occurs in a and b.
Yes, that's it! But I'm not sure how to compare the indexes

The error is pretty clear isn’t it? You have an index that is neither a real positive integer nor a logical Try stepping through the code with the debugger if you can’t see what happens , it would be pretty easy to find.
when i try this: [i,j,v] = find(a&gt;=0.5); [k,l,m] = find(b&gt;=0.5); for ix=(2:max(length(i),length(k))) outa=0; outb=0; outc=0; if i(ix) &lt; k(ix) &amp;&amp; i(ix+1) &lt; k(ix) outa=outa+1; end if i(ix) &lt; k(ix) &amp;&amp; i(ix+1) &gt; k(ix) outc=outc+1; end if i(ix) &gt; k(ix) &amp;&amp; i(ix+1) &lt; k(ix) outc=outc+1; end if i(ix) &gt; k(ix) &amp;&amp; i(ix+1) &gt; k(ix) outb=outb+1; end end I get the error Index exceeds matrix dimensions. Error (line 129) if i(ix) &lt; k(ix) &amp;&amp; i(ix+1) &lt; k(ix)
I am not very good with Matlab. I really don't understand what the problem is or what to change.
Your subscript indices are the references you're making to an element of the vector (e.g `theta(i)` or `B(i)`). So, it's saying `i` must be positive integers or logicals. Look how you defined `i`. Do you see your problem?
OH so I should start from 1 not 0 Thanks!
ok so i've tried this: [i,j,v] = find(a&gt;=0.5); [k,l,m] = find(b&gt;=0.5); for ix=(2:min(length(i),length(k))) outa=0; outb=0; outc=0; if i(ix) &lt; k(ix) &amp;&amp; i(ix+1) &lt; k(ix) outa=outa+1; end if i(ix) &lt; k(ix) &amp;&amp; i(ix+1) &gt; k(ix) outc=outc+1; end if i(ix) &gt; k(ix) &amp;&amp; i(ix+1) &lt; k(ix) outc=outc+1; end if i(ix) &gt; k(ix) &amp;&amp; i(ix+1) &gt; k(ix) outb=outb+1; end end but this gives me outa =0; outb=0; outc=0. 
Check out fopen and textscan. https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/79885-reading-dat-files-into-matlab
Do you know the difference between `*` and `.*`? In MATLAB, all variables are actually matrices. A scalar is just a 1x1 matrix. Thus, whenever MATLAB sees `*` it attempts to do Matrix multiplication, and if you instead want to do element-wise multiplication, you want to use `.*` instead. Now, I don't know your equations, but I'm guessing you want to use Matrix multiplication (so, just `*`) to solve for `dv0`. However, that's not what you're doing. However, if you just change that, you'll get a different error, but I think you can quickly figure out what that is. 
Gotcha, I'll re post with proper context. Sorry about that.
I am relatively new to Matlab and need to solve an equation for x. What is a better way to solve without using symbolic math?
Load can easily open .dat files. You just have to delete any headers in the file before using load so make sure you save a copy before you modify it. 
Let me offer up a rebuttal: If you've got complex equations, but you also care about performance, then the Symbolic Toolbox is still a great tool for the job! The key is to use the toolbox's [*matlabFunction*](https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/matlabfunction.html) function to convert your symbolic equation into either an anonymous function or m-file. As an example, I've recently been working with Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) and found it easier to verify the math if I constructed the basis functions symbolically. (Every piece of literature will state something to the effect of "by using the recursive definition we never have to explicitly construct the basis functions") I provide the following example that, while not NURBS, will fit within a Reddit response and demonstrates the functionality: %% SYMBOLIC SUBSTITUTION (SLOW!!) x = sym('x'); A = [0 1 2]; condition = A(1) &lt;= x &lt; A(2) valueIfTrue = x^2; otherwiseValue = 0.5; fx = piecewise(condition,valueIfTrue,otherwiseValue) u = linspace(min(A),max(A),1000); f = @() (double(subs(x,u))); time1 = timeit(f); disp("Symbolic Substitution of " + string(length(u)) + " elements takes " + string(time1) + " seconds.") y1 = double(subs(fx,x,u)); % Plot the function %% ANONYMOUS FUNCTION GENERATION condition = A(1) &lt;= x &amp; x &lt; A(2) fx = condition .* valueIfTrue + ~condition .* otherwiseValue anonFun = matlabFunction(fx); u = linspace(min(A),max(A),1000); f = @() (anonFun(u)); time2 = timeit(f); disp("Anonymous Function Evaluation of " + string(length(u)) + " elements takes " + string(time2) + " seconds.") %% Comparing and verifying the results disp("Anonymous Function Evaluation of " + string(length(u)) + " elements is " + string(round(time1/time2)) + "x faster than Symbolic Substitution.") y2 = anonFun(u); if all(abs(y1-y2)&lt;1e-12) disp("Results are equivalent to working precision") end figure;hold on plot(u,y1,'DisplayName', 'Symbolic Evaluation') plot(u,y2,'--','DisplayName','Anonymous Function') legend The output from this code, on my PC, displays the following: Symbolic Substitution of 1000 elements takes 0.23737 seconds. Anonymous Function Evaluation of 1000 elements takes 6.4416e-06 seconds. **Anonymous Function Evaluation of 1000 elements is 36850x faster than Symbolic Substitution.** **Results are equivalent to working precision** 
Code: function main func = @(x,y) sign(exp(-x^6-y^2+sin(7*y+x^4)*sin(3*x+y^4))-.47); %func Could be gridded interpolant function from terrain data figure(1); clf plot(0,0,'w'); axis([-1.5 1.5 -1.5 1.5]); axis equal area = quadtree(-1.5,1.5,-1.5,1.5,.001/2,func) function area = quadtree(x1,x2,y1,y2,err,func) if ((func(x1,y1)==1) &amp;&amp; (func(x1,y2)==1) &amp;&amp; (func(x2,y1)==1) &amp;&amp; (func(x2,y2)==1) &amp;&amp; ((x2-x1)*(y2-y1)&lt;0.01)) area = (x2-x1)*(y2-y1); rectangle('Position',[x1 y1 x2-x1 y2-y1],'FaceColor',[.52 .45 .5]); elseif ((func(x1,y1)==-1) &amp;&amp; (func(x1,y2)==-1) &amp;&amp; (func(x2,y1)==-1) &amp;&amp; (func(x2,y2)==-1) &amp;&amp; ((x2-x1)*(y2-y1)&lt;0.01)) area = 0; rectangle('Position',[x1 y1 x2-x1 y2-y1]) else if (x2-x1)*(y2-y1) &gt; err x12 = (x1 + x2)/2; y12 = (y1 + y2)/2.0; %midpoints for quadtree a1 = quadtree(x1, x12, y1, y12,err,func); a2 = quadtree(x12, x2, y1, y12,err,func); a3 = quadtree(x1, x12, y12, y2,err,func); a4 = quadtree(x12, x2, y12, y2,err,func); area = (a1+a2+a3+a4); else area = (x2-x1)*(y2-y1)*.5; rectangle('Position',[x1 y1 x2-x1 y2-y1],'FaceColor',[.95 .05 .45]); drawnow; end end end end
To build on Matt's post, if/when you get to the GUI I recommend using the App Designer. If you're running 2016b or newer you have it.
You should notice better performance with writetable than xlswrite.
If you want a numeric answer for x, use a numeric solver. An easy one to use is [fzero](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fzero.html). It will work much faster than the numeric `solve`. 
I am a big fan of importdata(), which handles headers and different kinds of delimiters. e.g., loading a file can look like: nolenstest = importdata('/Users/perand/Documents/fors/emch/3dlens/3dlensexp/3dlens_nolens_20170929_001.txt', ' ', 13) ; Where the ' ' means space delimited and 13 means 13 lines of header. Not sure if this is fast (probably not) but for homework sized problems it totally rocks.
If v is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue lambda, then (I being the identity matrix, 0 being the 0 vector) Av = lambda \* v Av = lambda * Iv Av - lambda\*Iv = 0 (A - lambda\*I)v = 0 From there, it's just solving a linear system of equations, which is achieved by `linsolve`.
When in doubt, brute force. The most straight forward solution is to calculate the distance (use pythagoras to calculate distances) between each point and each other point. Using the language of loops, this translates to: Make a loop over all points (i), and within the loop, make another loop over all other points (j), and inside both nested loops calculate the distance between point i and j. This way you calculate the distances between all points. A neat feature would be to choose the things the the nested loop (over j) loops over smartly, in order to prevent calculating the same thing twice. 
loop over the elements of k. For each element, check the distance to the closest next (aka next) value in k and the distance to the closest next index in l (not necesairily the next). compare the two. subtraction, logical indexing (next values in l : l(l&gt;k(i)) ) and the min function should do most of hte work for you. 
`eig` has optional outputs. You can ask it to return eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors. Does this help? 
Why not use the built in eigenvalue/eigenvector solver?
In your example your vectors are both increasing, but you didn't say if this was for sure the behavior. If so, you could probably speed this up some, but I would just compare `min(abs([k(1:ind-1), k(ind+1:end))] - k(ind))` to `min(abs(l - k(ind))` (and in that first expression, catch your edge cases)
And while this isn't too important for this problem, since we're not dealing with that big of a calculation, it's good to get in the habit of doing some basic things to speed up your code. In this case, calculate `d^2` (aka- the distance away squared) and compare it to the radius of the particle squared. This way, you avoid taking a square-root, which is a costly function computation time wise. 
Is there one? How would you call that?
`[e, v]=eig(A)` will return all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. 
And then you find an eigenvalue to within epsilon of 1, and the corresponding eigenvector... Alright, that can work.
That should be about 5 lines of code. Read the image in matlab (imread) determine the X and Y coordinates of the locations where there is mass (rework the output of imread to a 2d logical matrix and use find with two outputs), and find the mean value in x and y.
Ok, i couldn't resist....: %load gif [im,cmap] = imread('Scotland-Outline - Copy.gif') ; %apply the colormap (gif is a tabled image format) im3 = reshape(cmap(im+1,:),[size(im),3]) ; %find scotland imlogical = im3(:,:,1) &lt; 0.001 ; %find CM [ii,jj] = find(imlogical) ; CM = [mean(ii),mean(jj)] ; %show CM figure(1414) ; imagesc(im3) ; hold on % plot(CM(2),CM(1),'mx') ; 
Please don't just do homework for people. We try to be a sub where we help people learn. 
The flair.. How could I not see the flair..
Yes. 1. Describe the test, and write down equations 2. Code the test and equations into Matlab
You’ve literally described the conditional tests you want to perform, in your post. Just code it into Matlab, I’m not sure exactly what help you’d need on that. 
Dude learn to edit your comments instead of posting new comments repeatedly just because you did a thing 
+ I tried this for ix=(1:length(j)-1) if min(abs(l-j(ix)), l&gt;j(ix)) &gt; j(ix+1) dir1(ix)=1; end outdir1=sum(dir1(:),1); end which just doesn't work at all. this gives me oudir1=0
Assuming j here is the k from your question.. you seem to be reasonably close to the answer (for as far as i can tell without testing), but you give two inputs to min, from which it then selects the smallest value. You need give it only one input, which is the first argument, but then modified such that you don't compare j(ix) to all elements in l, but only to the elements in l that are larger than j(ix).
+ Thanks! Yes, I should have mentioned, they increase for sure. 
works for me
so the actual *code* I have is right, but the issue is the compiling. Could it just be an issue of me missing toolboxes then?
you'll need the symbolic toolbox yeah
maybe you shouldn't capitalize "audioread" because the function you want to call is "audioread(..)" not "AUDIOREAD(...)"
Error in navkriznaKor (line 2) [x, fs] = audioread('C:\Users\Tanja\MATLABproject\yodler.wav'); i still get error
Thanks, I'll have to pass it on to my professor to see if he can figure it out. 
why don't you tell us what the error is, genius
Try looking into delaunay triangulation. It is much faster than looping (about 10 times)
anytime, best of luck with the assignment
i did in first line.. gonna post it again in case you missed it.. Error in navkriznaKor (line 2) [x, fs] = audioread('C:\Users\Tanja\MATLABproject\yodler.wav');
that doesn't tell us what the error is, it just tells us where it happened. What happens when you run [x, fs] = audioread('C:\Users\Tanja\MATLABproject\yodler.wav'); Also, is your code actually split across two lines or is that just how you've formatted it? you can't just split a command into two lines like that.
I copied it and pasted it and it ended up in 2 lines. As for error i dont know what it is, its something in that line and it wont even proces it
this is why I'm asking what happens when you run [x, fs] = audioread('C:\Users\Tanja\MATLABproject\yodler.wav'); by itself
nothing, could something be wrong with place where im saving project? i mean everything else is working, except opening files.
You might start by formatting a function correctly. https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/function.html
im formatting other functions that dont require output or input same and the work perfectly fine, again i have problems only with opening files.
tried to make it correct just in case and ofc result is the same
What'd you change to make it correct? Currently, your first line is out of order. The correct order is: `function [outputs] = functionName(inputs)`
Are you able to give an insight to the real data and why you want to do this just to ensure there isn't an easier to get what you want? I am thinking at the moment something like: Datagroup=0 ; Counta=0; Countb=0; Countc=0; For I=2:length (a) Switch datagroup=0 If a (i)&gt;=0.5 Counta=Counta+1; Datagroup=0; If b (i)&gt;=0.5 Countc=Countc+1; Datagroup=1; Else continue End End End Switch datageoup=1 Blah blah......... You may have to look up the switch syntax as im certain I have made loads of mistakes here. Hope this helps tho?
What's the description along with the error?
What problems are you having, exactly? Right now your code returns an error on line 3 in your definition for Cx. Do you know why?
I realized that I left out the @(t) for both Cx and Cy, but the error I come across is: Error in A5_Try2 (line 8) t = linsapce(-2*pi,2*pi,1200); I'm not sure what that means or how to fix it. 
The error is clear, it should say: "Undefined function or variable 'linsapce'."
Okay cool. Are you asking for permission? You don't need permission. Go ahead. 
I have updated the code to the following: x = @(t) (cos(t)^3 ) y = @(t) (sin(t)^3 ) Cx= @(t) (cos(t)*(8+5*cos(2*t)+3*cos(6*t)))/(13+3*cos(4+t)); Cy= @(t) ((4*sin(t)^3)*(7+6*cos(2+t)*3*cos(4*t)))/(13+3*cos(4+t)); t = linspace(-2*pi,2*pi,1200); for i=1:length(t) xPar(i) = x(t(i)); yPar(i) = y(t(i)); xPar(i) = Cx(t(i)); xPar(i) = Cy(t(i)); end plot(x,y) hold on plot(Cx,Cy) hold off
For reference, the variable nargin give you the number of variables (beyond other declared parameters) that are passed into the function.
As it stands right now, your for loop is going from 0 to whatever is inputted as t, setting x and y equal to that value, potting a single point, and then iterating. Without the “hold on” command, this will result in the plot being drawn from scratch every time it encounters the “plot” command. However, that aside, even if you had “hold on,” your code would just be plotting the line y = x as a series of points. If you want to plot a line, you need to give the “plot” command vectors. For example, if you had y = 0:t x = 0:t plot(x,y) You’d end up with that same line y = x but you’d at least see the whole thing. 
Look into organizing your data properly in a [table](https://mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/table.html). It's so much more practical in the long term if you want to do stats or represent data using the [gramm](https://github.com/piermorel/gramm) visualization toolbox. So ideally you want all your alpha data points in a single long column accompanied by another column of the same length that indicates to which subject each data point belongs to (i.e. one row per trial, if you have trials). Then you can use rowfun() in order to apply any function (here your circular test) to data grouped by subject.
Yes I was. You actually gave me exactly what I was looking for. I can use (0:t) as my time variable and get a plot of what I need. Thank you!
No problem, glad to help :)
Sounds like it could be a good idea
You can plot using: Plot(X1,y1); hold on; plot(x2,y2). You can select the figure you want to plot the second figure in with the *figure()* function. Otherwise you can calculate the distance between two points using a norm function.
Any luck visualizing the individual eigenmodes of vibration? I would love to see what it looks like
[removed]
lol
Yeah its a nice trick to know in advance
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit: - [/r/engineeringstudents] [Monte Carlo Simulation for Finite Element Analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/7eokot/monte_carlo_simulation_for_finite_element_analysis/) &amp;nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
Right now your code is pretty hard coded so your best bet is so throw a for loop around the machinery and at each iteration use a different E value 
Agreed. Define an array of E values and for loop everywhere that you use E in a calculation.
Okay new update. I just got a G4600 pentium CPU, 2 cores 4 threads no AVX 2. Without AVX2, it finishes the benchmark in 45 seconds, which means that AVX2 is absolutely needed for matlab
Why not just make a function out of this with your E(3) as an input and your relevant parameters as outputs? You can put this new function inside a loop as recommended above, but it will be nice and clean. Plus you'll learn how to make a function.
I would do this with logical indexing. Instead of using scalars and iterating, use vectors x = 0:360; y = zeros(size(x)); Then create the masking array that selects which elements to use mask = x&lt;=0 &amp; x &lt; 90; and operate on that portion of the array y(mask) = x(mask) .* L./90; Repeat for all the other conditions, then plot(x, y) will make the plot you want. Pay attention to the operators; use the array operators `.*` and `./` rather than the matrix operators `*` and `/`. Also check your comparisons, `x == 0 &amp; x &lt; 90 ` is the same as `x == 0`.
Try reading up on textscan()
Thank you so much! I'm quite stuck on only using the elements in l that are larger than j(ix). Do you have any suggestions by any chance?
[Logical indexing:D](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/matrix-indexing.html) (seriously, learn logical indexing, its a great tool) heres an example : data = magic(6) -20 logicalIndexingArray = sign(data)==-1 negativeValuesFromData = data(logicalIndexingArray) note that the style of this example is hideous, more sensible is using a style similair to example 1 from the doc, but i felt this clarity adds value here. 
Thanks, I'll have a look into it now and see if I can get it to work 
Does the problem specifically state that 0 or 8 have to be in there? Step size not landing precisely on the upper bound is seen commonly in Matlab problems.
No, judging by the problem statement being as-is, the professor doesn't explicitly state inclusion of the set's bounds. I'm mostly asking because at first read, I was between the step method vs. linspace, but since a step *is* explicitly requested, I went with the first.
I think you've probably got the answer the question is leading to.
Thank you very much!
Your function is probably supposed to return a vector of numbers. Either way, at least in newer versions of mutual, you can put as many functions as you want in a .m file and they can all call each other inside the file, but outside of the file you can only "see" the first function.
It is, we’re meant to call it as the function in a Runge-Kutta differential equation solver. My script for the rksolve works, it was covered in an earlier question. But that’s my point - calling the .m file in a different .m file for my rksolve can only lend it to have one function inside it, no? Unless rksolve would just solve every defined function inside the called .m file. 
I imagine your rksolve takes a function handle as it's main input? If so, you pass in the handle to the "visible" function which in turn calls the "hidden" functions.
No, you just need one function that returns a vector that describes how your system is changing.
[removed]
Yes, it does. My rksolve pastebin is [here](https://pastebin.com/vftxvyCG) The command line I used is thus (for example): [tvec,xvec] = rksolve (@pendtheta, 0.0, 30.0, [0.1;0], 0.01); where pendtheta is a previous script I'd written earlier in the assignment. (pastebin [here](https://pastebin.com/zQvLyUTz) ) Finally this is my func.m the assignment wants [here](https://pastebin.com/qjNRLVs) It doesn't run when I try to run it using the command line above with changed starting values and dt as appropriate per the question. 
But I'd have two different systems? Or is that irrelevant and just write them all in the same .m file?
It doesn't matter. You return a vector how how your system is changing. Matlab doesn't care if the equations relate to each other or are independent. All the solver will see is the value of the derivative at a certain time, not the variable names, not their functions, not anything but the vector outputted by your function.
okay. I'll try and write it then. Thank you.
Logical indexing will help you if you can create the vectors B and A. To get the elements of T where your inequality is satisfied: TFiltered = T(B&gt;A); To get the maximum of these values, just use the max() function: TFilteredMax = max(TFiltered); This can be combined into a single line: TMax = max(T(B&gt;A)); You'll have to make sure that T, B, and A are all the same size and shape, or the results might not work how you expect. If T, B, and A are matrices, you might need to adjust the inputs to the max function based on what you need. For info on the max function: help max
Maybe [this](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/solving-odes-in-matlab-3-classical-runge-kutta-ode4-117528.html) can help? Also, try to write how you would do that on paper, and then think of how you could "translate" this into MATLAB code. In many cases I found that writing things down first helped me a lot to understand the problem and how to solve it.
Fyi, textscan can either loop thru the whole file on its own or process just a row. I haven't had much luck without using it row by row with typical text input file formats
have you ever used matlab before?
Never, unfortunately 
have you ever coded in any language?
No. Sorry if this sounds like trolling, but I'm not. My professor decided to give this homework as a substitute of an exam. And now we have to code in a language he didn't teach us throughout the semester. 
Well, before you can start solving ODEs, you're gonna need to get familiar with the Matlab interface and syntax. Open Matlab and mess around. The command window is basically an advanced calculator. In order to do what you want, you're going to need to understand: 1. Assigning vectors 2. Creating functions 3. Vector indexing 4. Plotting 5. [ode45](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ode45.html), or the ode4 subroutine I'd recommend starting with watching YouTube videos on starting in Matlab because without coding experience, it's hard to advise you from scratch.
You are very kind. I appreciate it.
If I were you I would import the entire .dat file and then loop through the rows. Don't try and import one row at a time.
&gt; But his program instantly uses all of my RAM when I give him a file that's like 30 MB of binary data. Assuming no obvious errors (like preallocating an array as zeros(1000000) instead of zeros(1,1000000)) my first thought would be that a small integer data type (or even perhaps the actual bitwise representation) is being saved as doubles. fread/fwrite tends to prefer to use doubles rather than whatever data type you are actually reading, so that can inflate the data size quite a bit (and I believe even if you immediately convert it to the proper type it might still temporarily save it as doubles, causing a memory spike). alternately, maybe the intern is calling the original data loading function which outputs it as ascii and starting from there (which sounds like it blew things up to a similar extent). Still, for turning 30mb into data into enough to take up GB's of memory (assuming you arent running it on a potato) my money is there is a rouge operation somewhere that is using up a ton of ram. I think its possible to get the built in timing feature (the GUI one, not 'tic and 'toc') to also give some indicator of memory usage on a line-by-line basis. Alternately you could limit the memory usage and see what line it fails on. If it is related to representing small-bit integers as doubles the "read as a binary dump then typecast" approach should fix that as well, since you can just read everything as (u)int64's (which take the same amount of memory as doubles) and then typecasting the output actually sets it with the proper data type.
&gt; If your final answer is a number- don't touch the symbolic toolbox... If what you want at the end is an equation, well then I still don't use the symbolic toolbox, I use Mathematica. This is exactly what I do as well. Anything tricky enough that I dont want to do with pen and paper is usually complicated enough to warrent using mathematica rather than matlab. FYI: somewhere long the way I picked up a function for Mathematica called "ToMatlab[...]" that takes some expression in mathematica and converts it to a format that Matlab will accept. A few things dont quite get converted right (special symbols and subscripts immediately come to mind), but for the most part it does a pretty good job. Also, Ive found you can automatically fix most of these errors by wrapping ToMatlab in another function doing something like myToMatlab[x_]:=StringReplace[StringReplace[ToMatlab[x],WhiteSpace-&gt;""],"old string"-&gt;"new string"] If your interested I have it on my computer at home, I can upload it later today. 
can you use a try/catch statement to handle the errors instead of having the script abort?
&gt; Holy jesus. I just got back word from the sysadmin, and they run a modified 2012 version of MATLAB for some 32-bit incompatibility problems! Dont you just love when stuff like that happens? You should really try and convince whoever to update your licenses to 2017b. I have to imagine that 5 years worth of new stuff and speed improvements (and full 32/64 bit support) would probably make it worthwhile. If you need to use those machines though id reccomend just re-coding it yourself. quasi-newton is a pretty straightforward algorithm, and will almost certainly be quite a bit faster then fminunc. From what i remember off the top of my head, there are really only 2 parts that might be tricky: 1) Using BFGS to approximate the hessian can be a tad tricky, but there are freely available BFGS codes online. This assumes you cant (easily) calculate the exact hessian - if you can then you should be using the standard newtons method rather than quasi-newton. 2) choosing a stepsize. typically I start out with a 1D newtons method approach (in the direction of the search direction). Then when that converges i'll check the wolfe conditions. If the point found passes then great, on to the next iteration. If the point found fails the wolfe conditions check, there are a few ways you can deal with it. If you can figure out if the point failed because it was too close/far then you can try to increase/reduce the stepsize in a brute-force type of manner and keep doing so until you find a point that passes. Alternately, you can do something along the lines of randomly sample some points around where you started the 1D newtons method (but not too close) and choose one with low error as a new seed point and then repeat the whole process until the point found satisfies the Wolfe Conditions (with a fail safe to tell it to say "fuck it" and move on if it repeats a given point too many times).
Thanks for the comment. I don't actually mind the script aborting as when that happens, there is supposed to be something wrong with the synching of the monitor refresh rate and... something within Psychtoolbox, so it's safer to not run the study that way. Plus if I try run the session again after the error, it always works fin. (And synctroubles like this are extremely rare to begin with. What I'm more interested in is whether I can trust my RTs when the scripts DOES run.)
The first input of the ODE45 function is a function handle. I.e. it should be: [t,x]=ode45(@example1p8,[0 500],[9 * pi/180 0]);
&gt; [t,x]=ode45(@example1p8,[0 500],[9 * pi/180 0]); Then I get this error: Error using odearguments (line 92) EXAMPLE1P8 returns a vector of length 1, but the length of initial conditions vector is 2. The vector returned by EXAMPLE1P8 and the initial conditions vector must have the same number of elements. Error in ode45 (line 115) odearguments(FcnHandlesUsed, solver_name, ode, tspan, y0, options, varargin); Also, in the function file, 't' is said to be unused and could be replaced by '~' 
&gt; Also, in the function file, 't' is said to be unused and could be replaced by '~' Well yea, because in your function t is not used at all. [t,x]=ode45(@example1p8,[0 500],[9 * pi/180 0]); function xdot=example1p8(t,x) J=1000; um=10; dtr=pi/180; xdot(1,1)=x(2); if x(1)&lt;9.5 * dtr u=um; elseif x(1)&gt;10.5 * dtr u=-um; else u=0; end xdot(2,1)=u/J; end Is the entire script I have, just copy pasted from your code. Works fine for me
It worked now, thanks for the help, much appreciated! 
Import the data into a matrix and then manipulate it how you see fit within matlab. Or you fopen/fseek/freed if the file is huge and you want to save time.
This is so incredibly vague, I'm not sure how you'd expect someone to figure out what's going on. That being said, "massive magnitudes" is a common feature when there is a numerical "blow-up" especially when solving stiff ODEs. I'm not sure what numerical processes this simulation relies on but I'd bet that there is a numerical issue at some point in the code. Either a division by 0/eps or an integration issue for a stiff ODE.
Try making the step size smaller for the RK4. I don't know how your model is set up, but you might be able to use built in functions like ode45 or lsim.
I use trust-region for the first part when I already have a hessian and then use quasi newton for the second part. The problem they told me was: They stopped support for Matlab on Linux for 32bit, but brought it back for windows. So an error occurred from using optimoptions over optimset since the former didn't exist in version 2012a.
I've used .emf/Enhanced Meta Files in the past, which work fairly well. A word of caution, when embedding it into a Word doc and saving the overall file as a PDF, the way the plot looked could change based on the viewer (Adobe, Foxit, Chrome, etc.). If you're going to be using Illustrator to do some additions though, this may not apply to you. When I was doing this, I would just do it from within the figure using File-&gt;Save As, then selecting "Enhanced Meta file (.emf)" in the file type selection. I'd image you can do this programmatically if you have a bunch of plots you need to create. 
Thanks, I'll give that a shot. I usually export from MATLAB as pdf, dress the plot up in Illustrator and apply some extra effects that MATLAB can't do (like semi-transparent lines), and save as pdf. I also save a copy as png for Word because holy f that program doesn't like pdfs!
Assuming your code is all correct in the "math" sections, setting up a Monte Carlo with what you have is pretty simple: just write a loop around the math part: for i = 1:MCRuns E(3) = random sample % Do math % store results end I typically use randn for generating normal random variables, and it looks like you're generating all the random samples at once right here. I'd hold off on that until you make sure everything else is working (also, makes the code a bit weird since E looks to be a 1-D vector, then you're throwing in 100000 elements into E(3)). You need to figure out what information you're storing, then look at averages or histograms to plot the results.
Hm, saving as EMF seems to be a vectorized file, which is a step in t he right direction, but my computer is NOT happy with it. I can barely get Illustrator to respond when the thing is on screen, I can't zoom in, and I can't edit anything. I even tried saving it as an .ai file and it still causes my system to lag horribly, and still has all the same issues.
I would think that has little to do with the file type. It’s just that the amount of lines in the vector output probably is gigantic. Have you checked the file size? One possible solution would be to output parts of the plot in batches that are either small enough so that matlab doesn’t see the need to raster them or at least small enough that your image editor can handle them.
If the use of optimset is the only issue I think you can probably manually set all the options that optimset would have automatically set (you may have figured that out already, but in case you didnt think of it). Honestly, 2012a is over 5 years old at this point...it wouldnt surprise me if a good number of functions (outside of those needed for basic functionality) arent available. Assuming you get paid (and arent a grad student slave like myself lol) and use Matlab fairly often if I were you Id go to whoever might have the power to buy a new version and make the case that "using an old ass version of matlab was directly responsible for ___ hours lost, and ___ will probably increase in the future (not to mention the indirect effect of slower running code)". I bet you get at least 1 new license out of it.
Nope I'm a grad student using the department servers for their better CPUs for my thesis work. Luckily I got it working by swapping the options from one to another.
I appreciate you taking the time to actually test it. I ran a few quick tests with the original function and my results were mostly in line with yours (for 100 million elements the anonymous function was taking ~2.5 sec (~1s of which was initial setup that was independent of number of points), and the best vectorized numeric function I could find was ~0.5 seconds, so 3-5x faster (depending on if the initial setup time is relevant in your problem). At that point it pretty much comes down to whether or not it is performance critical in a long-running function. If it is 3-5x (assuming similiar scaling) is well worth it, and is probably worth getting an analytic solution (preferably with mathematica) and then writing some fast matlab code (and for things like this it will be closer to the 5x limit, since initial setup is almost always negligible). If its not performance critical its probably only a few seconds difference. I admit im kind of impressed how much faster the anonymous function version is. Now that you mention it I do remember at one point figuring out that MatlabFunction was quite a bit quicker (though iirc I used it with feval, not an anonymous function). Im kind of curious now. I almost half want to go back and try to edit my original code to use an anonymous function and see how well it works, though i probably should be spending my time on the mountain on matlab code I still need o write in the coming days... &gt; Then when you need performance, rewrite your code in Fortran or C++. Ive found you can realistically make Matlab code just as fast (well, within a few percent anyways) as well written C/Fortran code. The trick is to convert everything that is remotely computationally expensive to matrix-matrix or matrix-vector multiplication. It makes sense this should be almost the same speed as the C/FORTRAN implementation since all Matlab does is take your input, wraps it in a function call GEMV or GEMM (the general matrix-vector and matrix-matrix subroutines in BLAS/LAPACK) and then calls GEMV/GEMM and gives you the answer, so the only speed difference should be a tab of extra overhead on having matlab wrap the input and call GEMV/GEMM vs directly calling it from C/FORTRAN. (admittedly you mght be able to use a slightly newer BLAS running on C, but I dont see this really mattering unless you have AVX-512 or something like that. Matlab uses Intels MKL library for BLAS, which seems to be one of the better implementations, provided youre not running an AMD CPU).
i'd bet it's due to the number of vectors that are being saved. if you have 25k lines in the plot, and each one is made up of multiple individual graphics, it might just be too much for your computer/ram/editing program. a raster file format doesn't have this problem since it's just saving the RGB information for whatever resolution the image is. i did some quick looking and while "plot" doesn't support transparencies, "patch" does. maybe take a look at this: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/103074-how-can-i-set-the-transparency-of-line-objects-in-matlab-7-14-r2012a if nothing else, it may be able to speed up your overall process a bit by bypassing Illustrator. 
I should clarify. If you need to solve an equation with variables and cant easily do it by hand then by all means use the symbolic toolbox. If you have access to mathematica solving it there and then transfering the result to matlab is a better option, but the symbolic toolbox works in a pinch. HOWEVER, once you have the solution and assuming you plan of using that solution in another code, you dont use the symbolic toolbox. I guess to put it another way, if you need to use symbolic math once to get a solution thats fine, but you dont want to be repeatedly solving for a variable using the symbolic toolbox. Simple example % solve for x (in practice there are probably better options than "solve" but this is just for tis trivial example) syms x a b xSol=solve(a*x==b,x); xSol = b/a % clear all symbolic variables now that you have an analytic solution for x clear a b c xSol % numerically plug in values for a and b % get every value in b divided by every value in a --&gt; [N x M] matrix, where N=numel(b) and M=numel(a) a=&lt;some values&gt; b=&lt;some values&gt; xNumericSol=bsxfun(@rdivide,reshape(b,[],1),reshape(a,1,[])); % NOTE the bsxfun function call above is a more efficient version of this: xNumerSol2=zeros(numal(b),numel(a)); % preallocate for nna=1:numel(a) % loop over a for nnb=1:numel(b) % loop over b xNumericSol2(nnb,nna)=b(nnb)/a(nna); end end
Lol, were in the same boat then. One other thing that might be worth mentioning: if you have access to Matlab coder and/or matlab compiler you can generate stand-alone code that will run without requiring Matlab to be installed. I forget which is which, but one converts the code to C code and the other runs the Matlab code the same as Matlab would (you have to either download some sort of Matlab runtime package to run it, but that is free. Alternately you can bulild it directly into the binary when you compile if you dont mind large executables). I Want to say Matlab coder does the C conversion and Matlab compiler is the other one. Both of them though should allow code to be run on any system using whatever version of Matlab you own (or the C code equivilant). If you dont have either but this seems useful, I think there is student pricing available on the one that runs the code as matlab code. iirc the one that converts to C is only available in the standard license and is rather pricey. Best of luck with your thesis. Hopefully you dont get stuck as a grad student for as long as I have lol (Ive now officially been a grad student for longer than I was an undergrad). (In all honestly I cant really complain, I have it pretty good for a grad student.)

No problem -- it helped that I've been actively working on it :) I'd be interested in hearing how it turns out for you if you decide to go back and rewrite some stuff! Totally with you on the performance aspect when it comes to the linear algebra stuff -- I mostly deal with large sparse systems of equations and MATLAB only stores sparse matrices in a single representation, for certain problems the various compressed formats can be a lot more efficient. Additionally, Matlab's equation solvers are focused more on robustness and error checking than performance. Lastly, it would cost 100k or just in software licensing to run a problem spread on 100 compute nodes -- and then I have my doubts on the scalability of Matlab in that case (e.g. There's a reason why [LAMMPS](http://lammps.sandia.gov/), [Uintah](http://uintah.utah.edu/), [Nalu](https://github.com/spdomin/Nalu), etc. are written in C/C++/Fortran.) That being said, my main desire is usually to prototype algorithms... I need these prototypes to not take 5 minutes to get to interesting parts, but a few seconds is ok... so I like using the Symbolic Toolbox + matlabFunction so I can more readily perform hand-calcs / sanity checks when needed, but still run quickly enough for rapid algorithm development.
The bottom line is that if you want to save a vectorized plot with 25,000 lines, you're going to have a vectorized file with 25,000 lines. And that will always slow down programs working with that vector.

I think your logic is slighty off. I see two things in the question that seem to be conflicting: &gt;When a square has at least one point inside or on the edge of the surface, it should be kept. and &gt; If it only has surface-covering points on the edge that have been covered before, it should be discarded. How about ignoring the edge? Your surface is wider than 0, so if a point on the edge of a square is covered by it, there is also a point not on the edge of the square covered by it. If there is only a point on the edge covered and not in the sqaure, the points on that edge are also covered by an adjacent square.
Okay, so I might've been a bit more clear on that. So if you look at [this image](https://i.imgur.com/AnGAP8w.png), boxes 1, 2 and 3 should be kept. Box 4 is currently discarded correctly. When I would be ignoring the edges, box 3 would have to be discarded since it only has covering points on the edge. However, the red point on the bottom edge is "new" (hasn't been covered by box 1 or 2 before) so it should be kept. This is not the case for boxes 5 and 6, because all of their covering points are on the edge and have been covered before (by boxes 2 and 3 respectively). Hopefully this is a bit better to understand.
You can see in box 3 there is a bit of your surface over the area and not the edge. Using a smaller grid and my proposed solution above should fix your issue. Then again, how small do you have to make your grid make it ALWAYS go right? I would not use sample points, but calculate intersections beteween your surface edges and square edges, and use inpolygon only on the corners of your surface and the squares. Those two data will be sufficient to determine what squares cover your surface, but will require some hard thinking (probably).
+ Didn't really think about that. I've experimented a bit with requiring a bigger amount of data points and that seems to guarantee points that are not on the edges for all the correct boxes. I think I'll keep using data points for now, partly because I would have to rewrite some other scripts as well and since it is based on a research paper from my supervisor using this method. The end goal of the project is to create a script for any random amount of dimensions, from 1D to nD, and any function to create the surface. I am going to put in a restriction to have a larger amount of data points (10x10 like in the image is actually more for visualization, I tend to use 100x100) and only test the point that are not on the edges, so probably adjust the for-loop to ignore the first and final row/column. Thanks for your idea! If I happen to have some time left I might try your method.
What is your question?
So I have made a little [adjustment](https://imgur.com/kUtWMu1). I didnt increase the 'k' so it couldn't run and just hanged there. But now it shows a lot of sins and coses instead of a simplified formula like taylor() does. And when I use plot() to make a graph for each level, it gave me [this error](https://imgur.com/fqq8wtZ). How can I fix them?
I cannot see what you changed, because the image quality is too bad, so I have to go with you initial attempt. First: You do not have to calculate the factorial of a numet in a loop. You can use the `factorial` function tha matlab provides. Or even better, you initialize `K` as 1 outside of all loops and multiply it by the loop number before computing the derivative. Second: Don't start with 0. The 0th derivative is the function. Use it as a starting value, not 0 and then start with 1. Third: You need to evaluate the derivative at the expansion point. Do not use it as a symbolic expression. Use the `subs` function. And for the plotting: Use `fplot`, not `plot`. `Plot` only works, if you already have evaluated your function and have actual numbers for a given range of your input.
Thank you for pointing that out. In fact my 'adjustment' was switching to the factorial function instead of using the 'while' loop. About the third point, can you eli5 the difference between syms and subs for me? I'm having a hard time understanding the terms in a different language.
Well with `syms`, you *define* a symbolic expression. So you say "look, I have a symbolic variable, that I call x". With `subs` you *evaluate* the given symbolic expression at a given point. It's like saying, that your symbolic sxpression is a matlab-function and you plug in numbers for your symbolic variables.
If I understand correctly, the subs(f,x,5) function calculates the value of 'f' with 'x' replaced with 5, right?
Correct.
But how can I use it in the program?
Well, instead of just `diff(y, k)`, you also evaluate the derivative at `a`: `subs(diff(y, k), x, a)`.
[removed]
Why do you think its incorrect?
+Thank you very much so far. Just one last thing. How can I put a legend for each of them, like T(1), T(2), etc...?
You save all legend entries to a cell array and when you are finished plotting your graphs, you call the `legend` function with this cell array.
Because it looked like the graph had a lot of edges, so i got uncertain.
+ I see, but how do can you create the correct number of cells in the array for all of graphs? Like if you input n = 5, it will generate an array with 5 cells corresponds to T1, T2, T3, T4, T5?
Yes, you would. Just use the `cell` function. 
So I will create an array, and use a loop to fill that array with T(k)? Does the 'k' increase in the array?
The legend entries are strings. You can plug in whatever you like. 😅
+Okay I got it to work. Thank you so much, kind sir!
do you realize why your line has a lot of edges? there's a line in your code responsible for that
No, which line is responsible for that?
which line is responsible for plotting the graph? where do the data for that line come from? can you increase the resolution of the line?
ok
 I acknowledge that a plot with 25k lines is not going to be easy on my computer, however, I feel like at some point matlab is doing something fundamentally different that is making things excessively hard. This same computer runs plots with 15k lines as with no problem, smooth as butter, but when I load the 25k plot everything starts lagging and locking up. I'm pretty sure this ones on matlab.
While I acknowledge that a plot with 25k lines is not going to be easy on my computer, however, I feel like at some point matlab is doing something fundamentally different that is making things excessively hard. This same computer edits plots with 15k lines as with no problem AT ALL, smooth as butter, but when I load the 25k plot everything starts lagging and locking up horribly. I'm pretty sure this ones on matlab. patch looks like it can do line transparency but unfortunately it's not the only editing on the plot I need to do, I still need to be able to edit thew vectorized plot
plot(t,c1); is the line for plotting t1 = linspace(0, 5,5); c1 = polyval(a, t); is where it get its data I tried chaing t1 to something else but its not working. Can you specify a bit more?
you need to generate more points for your line.
It creates 5 points between 0-5. But i've tried to change that to something like (0,2), that is 100 points between 0-2. But i still get the same graph
is it freezing up within the Matlab Figure or the EMF file? it's not totally clear where you're experiencing the freezing. are there "lots" of points per line on the 25k one compared to the 15-20k plots? It's my understanding that vector graphics essentially keep track of (x,y) data points and draw vectors between them. If that's the case, each of the "lines" may be made up of hundreds or thousands of (x,y) data points, so it's more like 25k*1000 points that are being tracked. Conversely, if the 15-20k lines are each only made up of a handful of data points, it's going to be significantly less information for the computer to keep track of.
The lines go between a random point inside of 5 boxes, so about 5 segments per line x 5000 lines. Running the same script with say 3500 lines produces a result that is always vectorized when saved to pdf and gives me no issues in illustrator at all. The issue is with MATLAB writing the file, almost positive. It either comes out rasterized, or completely unworkable in illustrator in a way I've never seen before even with similar plots.
I disagree with this statement, specifically the first line.
That's becuase you're plotting t vs. c1 and not t1 vs. c1. You also don't use t1 in the polyval function, you use t, which isn't what you want.
MATLAB doesn't like it when you just smash numbers and identifiers or functions together - it doesn't know what you mean when you say '2pi' or '4t' and doubly so for '5cos(2t)'. You should get an error on any line that features that mistake saying 'Unexpected MATLAB expression.' Interesting that the assignment has Wolfram links in it; WolframAlpha, for example, will parse that kind of expression, but MATLAB requires you to be **explicit** about *all operations*.
are you interpolating before or after the plotting/saving? if you're doing it before, you may be adding unnecessary data points. if doing the 3500 lines produces a vector pdf but something larger produces a raster pdf, i'd bet Matlab has some built-in checks where it will use a raster format when the plot data exceeds some threshold. maybe search for bumping up that threshold, or try to find where the break point is? regardless, i don't think saving as a PDF is the way to go here since it has this varying behavior. i'd search for other ways of saving figures as a vector graphic if the EMF file isn't working for you, maybe this: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/7401-scalable-vector-graphics--svg--export-of-figures 
Do you have an example of how you e tried to stop the simulation at y &lt;= ?
Check out semilogx and xlabel functions
Hey! I'm currently away from my PC so don't have the exact code attempts but from memory I tried: A While condition for when Y&gt;0 An If condition for when Y&lt;0 And an event condition for the value of T when the Y value became negative. Apologies if this isn't much help. I really am taking stabs in the dark with my attempts here. 
If my understanding is right, then the while loop would end when y &lt;=0, which makes the rest of the stuff irrelevant. I would need to see it to really know why it's not working though. 
Yes, you need to use the symbolic math toolbox if you want matlab to reason about symbolic expressions.
Since you're trying to use ODE45 to propagate forward in time, I believe you will need to use an "event". Try looking at this link for help: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/ode-event-location.html?requestedDomain=www.mathworks.com
If you know the transfer function of your system you can also use the bode function.
Of course, the symbolic toolkit! How would I go about using the integral2 then? Since it doesn't seem to allow me to specify which variable I integrate over. Do I just set the two desired ones to x and y? Thank you!
`integral2()` does numerical integration. If you need an expression for the integral, then tou should use `int()`. If you need to integrate over two variables, use `int()` twice.

Have you looked out the return values? aka what you do you get when you call xlsread? theres probably (assuming that you only take one output of xlsread, which probably works, but might not be ideal) a bunch of nans in rows where your headers are. You can use something like this to seperate the data: data = xlsread('data.xls'); seriesI = find(isnan(data(:,1)) ; for i =1 : numel(seriesI)-1 datasetdata = data(seriesI(i)+1:seriesI(i+1)-1),:) %do plotstuff here end You most likely need to adjust this code depending on the exact structure of your excel sheet, but this should get you going.
