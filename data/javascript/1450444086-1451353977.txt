Mouth opening.
&gt; I'd wonder what makes it "better". Perhaps there's a case for performance. what does performance have to do with anything? Was that your attempt at understanding why people prefer a style different from what you prefer? People argue it's better because there's less syntax to parse, but it's just as common and clear as `pending = pending - 1`. You can't really get more basic than decrementing a value. I think that adding parens around the operation like in your example is needless and adds an expectation of more complicated math. The most common uses for parenthesis in math operations are enforcing order of operations and breaking complex statements into more logical chunks. `pending - 1` doesn't really need to be broken up anymore and so the parens just add noise to the statement.
&gt; And once you've seen it once, you've got the pattern down. This is not confusing. Here's the problem: no one uses this pattern. No one in JS uses it, and no one outside of JS uses it. So why even bother when there are just as many clear, clean, easy to type and easy to read solutions that people understand? All this does is add extra overhead to the maintainer. If I read this code at my job, I get pissed at the asshole who wrote it cause he's trying to show off - either by being clever at how he thought through some cool JS thing or by showing how much of the language he knows. Which is stupid - want to be impressive? Write code that a junior programmer who just graduated college can understand without bugs. &gt;I gotta say probably need to brush up on your code reading skills if this confuses you for longer than five seconds, at worst That's probably fair. I struggled with this one for a good five or six minutes. Any suggestions where a guy who's been doing this shit for 10 years and is currently working with babel stage 0 and react and redux can brush up on his javascript and code reading skills?
You don't have to use the "createVariants" function. All it does is help with generating an array of configurations. As long as your webpack.config.js returns an array of configs, parallel-webpack will run those in parallel. So from what I understand that should be exactly your use case, right?
You could write your own, minimal simple HTTP-request wrapper: function http () { this.ajax = new XMLHttpRequest(); // Use IE backfalls and etc. if you need this.ajax.onreadystatechange = function () { if (this.ajax.readyState === 4) { this.onSuccess !== undefined ? this.onSuccess(this.ajax.responseText) : void 0; } else { this.onError !== undefined ? this.onError(this.ajax.responseText) : void 0; } return this; } http.prototype.data = function (data) { if(this.data === undefined &amp;&amp; data!==undefined) { this.data = data; } return this; } http.prototype.get = function (url,data) { if(this.open === false || this.open === undefined) { this.open = true; this.ajax.open('GET',url,true); data !== undefined &amp;&amp; this.data === undefined ? this.data = data : void 0; } return this; } http.prototype.post = function (url,data) { if(this.open === false || this.open === undefined) { this.open = true; this.ajax.open('POST',url,true); data !== undefined &amp;&amp; this.data === undefined ? this.data = data : void 0; } return this; } http.prototype.send = function () { this.ajax.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', this.ContentType) if(this.ContentType === 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded') { var tmp; var queryString = '?'; for( var i = 0, keys = Object.keys(this.data), len = keys.length; i &lt; len; i++) { queryString += keys[i]+'='+this.data[keys[i]]+'&amp;'; } this.data = queryString.replace(/\&amp;$/,''); } else if(this.ContentType === 'application/json') { this.data = JSON.stringify(this.data); } this.ajax.send(this.data); return this; } http.prototype.success = function (fn) { this.onSuccess = fn;return this; } http.prototype.error= function (fn) { this.onError= fn;return this; } And for models, just give them prototypes like: model.prototype.fetch = function () { var h = new http().get('/api/users').success(function (data) {this.data = JSON.parse(data)}.bind(this)).send() } model.prototype.save= function () { var h = new http().post('/api/users', JSON.stringify(this.newData)).send() }
Yes, that works nice in many cases. With github's whatwg-fetch polyfill it will be just: fetch('/item/12345').then(function(res){ res.json(); }).then(function(item){ // do anything }); But what if you have "ent1" related with "ent2" and "ent2" related with "ent3-5", and now you need to save all this structure using /entN endpoints. If it isn't hard enough, then add another 5-10 entities.
What do you mean by related? Could we see what kind of data structure you're using? I kinda have feeling you are looking at it from wrong viewpoint, and it could be simplified.
It's quite new compared to those. I don't know many projects using them yet except Angularjs 2 using systemjs (I think) and Aurelia using jspm; they both only just entered beta.
So far I've used self-written request wrapper, even with some special methods to handle endpoints mess. But I wonder how other developers solve this task?
Just for example look at [erd diagram](http://plasmon.rghost.ru/6fVlPZ72g/image.png). This API exposes database tables ([PostgREST](https://github.com/begriffs/postgrest)). Not the best solution, but we have 5 small apps with a lot of data, so maintaining separate API is not an option.
And this is why I use more parentheses than most. Because when you code in many languages on many platforms it is too easy to make a mistaken assumption about operator precedence.
I thought I was on /r/badcode or /r/shittyprogramming
I'd agree. Did I find it confusing? No. Does it make me a better javascript programming? Not really. Does it even really matter? Not at all. We're not all about writing code, guys. We're about building software. Building software requires teams. Teams requires a shared codebase. A share codebase requires reading others work and others maintaining code you wrote at some point. Is `!--pending` wrong? Nope. But it could potentially be clearer in a slightly more explicit and verbose expression of `--pending === 0`. Don't just think about your code, think about the team that will be maintaining your code. 
Why? would you rather wrap everything in lodash wrappers instead?
&gt;So this is like C# extension methods? (Or like modifying prototypes without the global side effects?) Yes &amp; No -- there's no modification, it's simple context binding with `apply`
Use ~~num instead of Math.Floor and a triple XOR assignment to swap variables. a \^= b b \^= a a \^= b Best of all ~[].indexOf() to check if something is in an array. It makes your code readable and your coworkers will love you.
No not at all :) I just wanted to say good job! I signed up and played round for a little bit a while ago. I'm training in web development, from a management position, and really liked your website. I must just use it more! 
They're called Yoda conditions for a reason. They have advantages as you can't assign something like that as it would result in an error. However I think the overall consensus is to not use them.

We've always used HipChat because it was an Atlassian product and we were using BitBucket/Jira/Confluence already. I know Slack integrates with all of those as well. The other reason is the UI in HipChat is a little nicer (to me at least). Slack has come a long way from when we first evaluated it too though. In fact, I have Slack installed for use in our wider organization (we are extremely decentralized) and I don't think I really have a preference of one vs. the other. 
Thank you for your reply - I just gave it a quick glance and if I add the line document.body.innerHTML += 'true'; after setInterval, it still evaluates that whilst the setInterval is running
Da fuck did I just watch?
The comment I replied to said literally, and I quote: &gt; If you're building any kind of project This is generally where, in internet etiquette, it would be acceptable for me to ask you to learn to read. Edit: Also you mixed up your and you're. No judgment, just sayin

Thanks for responding :-) So what I'm doing is generating webpack configs (in memory) based on some dynamic data and then running each one through webpack.compiler.run() I don't see how I could pass variables into my webpack.config.js if the parallel-webpack .run() method only accepts a path... am I missing something?
Got a link to it ?
I was thinking denounce() is the only time I use bind() anymore.
It's a good way to get bashed over your head with a keyboard by a fellow programmer. 
I do comparisons like these all the time. When I first ran into them I thought it was just somebody trying to be cute, but now I'm cute too and I don't run into any unexpected null pointer exceptions (here). I've adjusted fine to the backwards feel of the syntax.

Hi /u/kenman, this clearly enters the category of &gt; A working codepen/jsfiddle/etc. of the code. So, what was the reason to remove it?
If you have questions like this you may be the right person to benefit from the W3C courses on edX (note: they are free, the price is for people who want a "verified certificate"): https://www.edx.org/xseries/html5-w3c They includes *lots* of code samples and hands-on coding exercises shared via JSBin.
I believe it's because it's modeled after the Java `java.util.Date` object, which is also infamously a mess: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1969442/whats-wrong-with-java-date-time-api
 pending--; This is fine IMO. It's something we've known since we learnt what for loops were. 
Personally, if I put the opening brace on the same line, then I want to add an extra empty line to prevent the code from feeling too claustrophobic: function monkey() { doStuff(); } But as long as that's already an empty line, the brace might as well be occupying that space: function monkey() { doStuff(); } Result is that there's still that whitespace to make the code look better, but it's more.. balanced looking.
Months are typically zero-based because that's more convenient for mapping them to their names. Days, on the other hand, don't have names. That's why those start at 1.
Experience on the resume is always better than none. 
Your second approach is the correct one. pending is changed in two different if statements in OP's link, this is needless misdirection.
This is really nice! Thanks.
&gt; I just don't want to get "stuck" with a low salary as an entry level programmer for too long. For a majority of positions, this won't be a concern, because typically one of two things will happen: either you progress as a developer (and with that comes promotions), or you don't progress and are eventually let go. I would suggest that you take your time, since as you say, you have a family and a decent job already. While it's certainly prudent to consider your future career and its progression, you also have a responsibility to your family. It'd be really bad if you got into some entry-level gig, which turns out to be a nightmare that wants 60+ hrs/wk out of you doing work that doesn't really let you progress as a developer. Those types of jobs aren't commonplace, but they're not exactly rare either, and they prey on people with little experience in the industry and thus less likely to put up a fight about it. Once you get into one it can be really hard to pry yourself out, especially if you've got a lot of financial commitments already. Just be careful to not overwork yourself, because you don't want to burn-out before you ever really get started, and your family probably also would also like to spend time with you. I'd also like to offer-up a third option, which honestly sounds like a perfect fit for you: my company has a program that we run a few times a year, where we bring in 8-10 candidates that we think are smart, teachable, and driven, and we give them 90 days of paid instruction (taught by one of our developers in-house). The candidates are paid, and at the end of the program, a majority of them are offered a full-time position. So just keep an eye on Craigslist, and do your research on places like Glassdoor.com to vet them companies. Lastly, you might want to start networking, which never hurts; unless you're out in the middle of nowhere, there's likely some relevant free meetups and conferences in your area -- just start making connections and asking around!
Okay. That is indeed way more complicated but depending on details not completely impossible. There's a few options that I can think of at the moment, but you'll need to verify whether they can be applied to your problem: 1) Could the required configuration be fetched within the webpack.config.js such that it can return an array of Promises where each of these Promises resolves to a single webpack configuration? Limitations: - You need to know how many configurations you'll create. - Might not work with plain webpack anymore (though sokra mentioned he implemented some support for Promises natively, not sure if that's for Webpack 2 only, though) 2) There's a way to pass data into the webpack worker. We actually used that before I extracted this tool out of our code base but I refactored that portion out as it can easily get confusing and lead to a build structure that is way more complicated than it should be. The limitation here is that the data needs to be converted to a string (i.e. JSON) and that the webpack.config.js (in our case) essentially became a function which generated a config object for the given options. If you really need to generate the configs completely in memory and don't have an actual webpack.config.js file, option 2) should still work for you but it wouldn't be a particularly clean solution. You'd have to create some webpack.config.js-like file which exports a function to transform our dynamic data into a single webpack config. That file, however, would run in a separate process so it wouldn't be able to share data with your main process (where you'd be calling the .run() method). Would either of these help? The Array-of-Promises-Solution is already supported. The second one would require some small (compatible) changes to the API (wouldn't add it to the CLI) and might be more complicated to setup. If you'd like me to add that feature, it'd be great if you could setup some minimal test-case that I can use to verify that my implementation will indeed work for you. Maybe you could open a GitHub issue for it? Would be highly appreciated.
Sure thing :)
All great replies, thanks r/javascript, I was busy at work and this same topic came up lol so sorry for the delay in answering. 
Thanks for the advice but myself and a few other people I know in the industry had some extremely negative customer service experience with Titanium staff. I had asked about Titanium at a conference during meet &amp; greet and about 3 of the 9-10 people around the table said great product but shared those sentiments. Thanks for the help and info

Try parsing a date like 2015-06-04 00:00 only to find out after parsing and returning it to the server the server receives 2015-06-03 22:00. In this case the client uses GMT+1.
Eric Elliot is a blowhard and shameless self promoter.
I like that 3rd option. I'm doing something similar with a company called LaunchCode here in Miami, FL but most of the jobs that they are offering are about $15/hr during the training and then $45k-$50k after that. That basically puts me back to Option #2. I agree with networking. I do try to get out there and attend networking events in the area. I'll continue doing so because I know a lot of great opportunities come from networking. Your warning about those type of companies that take advantage of junior programmers is a big fear of mine. I don't want to give up what I have now to find myself at a company where I'm not doing much coding and serves me little in my future growth and development as a developer. I guess I have pretty high expectations for the company that I would like to work for. It's something that can really influence my future as a developer and my family's comfort so I don't take it lightly. 
It depends on where you are really. I struggled to find job making that kind of money and I had 2 and half years of professional development experience. 
That is a possibility. Thank you for your suggestion. I would be competing with full-time freelancers but I think it's doable. 
Thank for all the responses. I am a familiar JS developer, I just wasn't sure WHY this war against using "es6 class" existed so that's why I posted here. A lot of good responses. I read about of Eric's articles before and they were pretty helpful, so it was weird to me when I seen that quote about not hiring. I'm sure they're are plenty of managers out there that will use his guide as a hiring checklist, and I don't like that some managers will not hire someone because of it but they actually don't know why themselves are "supposed" to hate class inheritance. Anyway, [I think we made him mad.](http://i.imgur.com/k0kPMCJ.png). Eric, if you're watching, nothing personal man, just wished you would clarify your hatred. In a sensible manner. Do it on Twitter, or ever here.

&gt; But that doesn't mean we should start making sentences longer in hopes that it somehow magically improves readability. Exactly. People need to be cobol programmers so they can "ADD 1 to Pending" and not be confused trying to read those unreadable plus and equal signs. -= and -- and even ! have been around for so many decades it makes me wonder what language people are learning on. And on top of that even if you make it longer it still doesn't improve readability, because it's intention is still not clear. Even if you change how it's checking if pending is 0 it's still not immediately obvious why you're checking pending by looking for a zero or not or what other values pending could have. You still have to go look at where pending even came from to see that you're checking "is there anything left in the list". If they want readability then the way the pending variable is being used should be changed altogether so that by the time you get to the if statement is should just be "if (pending) { } else { }" or rename the variable to make it obvious that it's checking for an empty list. Unless that part is obvious in which case so is (!--pending)
Why do people not understand this? There was a dev that just left my company that **loved** to use the little javascript quirks that could be called "clever." Most of the team referred to them moreso as "unreadable" or "difficult to maintain." Take the four extra lines, your coworkers will thank you.
! and -- have been a part of programming long enough that they should be just as readable as pending -= 1 or pending = pending - 1 unless maybe you're maybe very new to programming. The bigger readability issue here is that pending is the count of a list and the statements are asking if there's anything in the list or not. The correct answer should have been that var pending = list.length; needs to change to var pending = (list.length !== 0); and then the if statements could just check if (pending) or if (!pending)
I actually always put a blank line as the first AND last line of a method... and I also always do this: } /* End XX(). */ Ditto any closing brace, loop, conditional, whatever. It makes following C syntax-based code SO much easier. 
 &gt; your coworkers will thank you. Your coworkers will not hate you is plenty. 
Shouldn't this line: // dot product λ((a, b) =&gt; a * b); // 10 be 11 and not 10? var a = exports.a = new Float64Array([1, 2]); var b = exports.b = new Float64Array([3, 4]); so &lt;1,2&gt; dot &lt;3, 4&gt; = (1)(3) + (2)(4) = 3 + 8 = 11 ?

I only used the interval to show you the generator pausing and resuming. It contains a while loop that pauses and resumes when you call `it.next()`. You don't have to use an interval to accomplish this.
Ah yes I was just skimming through the code. Anyways, nice article.
We should just all switch to zulu time. Fuck timezones.
&gt; I'd wonder what makes it "better". I think it's faster to read (at least, it is in the font I use for development; it doesn't help here that the minus sign and equals aren't aligned well). It makes it clear that you're decrementing the variable. You can also do `pending--` but I've never really liked that. `pending -= 1` or `counter += 1` makes it very clear very quickly that nothing major is happening, you're just incrementing or decrementing a var. 
&gt; Quick recap – the comma operator works like this: &gt; (expr1, expr2) === expr2 Fucking WHAT. I had no idea that syntax existed.
The optional curly braces is silly convention that JavaScript adopted from C. Consider these examples: if (x &gt; 5) y += 1; do x++ while (x &lt; 5); for (x = 0; x &lt; 10; x += 1) if (x === 5) return; Mozilla toyed with the idea of optional curly braces for functions for a while, but nobody else wanted it, so they decided to back off it. Curly braces are always mandatory for object literals and functions.
LMFAO @ your flair
That is the bulk of the home-grown test application. It also lints all the JS files in the project and some other things.
Those `__proto__` &amp; `prototype` mixed up confusion in many articles delayed my JS learning by a lot! Moreover it's a sad reality the lack of articles for transitioning Java/C# programmers to JS too! They should mention that `prototype` &amp; closures are equivalent to `static` in Java. In short, every object got `__proto__`/ `[[Prototype]]`. And functions got `prototype` in addition to that. And if that object was created w/ `new`, its `__proto__` points to the function constructor's `prototype` object. 
I would guess it's a comparison, e.g. if (a-- &gt; b) which is the same as if (b &lt; a--)
But what if XX() changes name? I had to deal with code recently where a bunch of for-loops had been turned into while-loops, but the `/* end for */` comments had remained. It was also horribly indented and had other issues, but it confused me for a while as I tried to work out where the for loops had appeared. I prefer to work on the basis that anything that requires opening and closing braces (i.e. functions) should be able to fit both opening and closing braces in one screen's height. That way it's usually fairly easy to scan through code and see the blocks clearly.
Typically seen in loops and other expression evaluations: for (var x=0,y=0,z=0; x&lt;10; x++,y++,z++) { console.log(x,y,z); }
12.4k is an easy hit to take in my opinion, considering how useful momentjs is.
&gt;Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it? * [Brian Kernighan](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan)
This...seems like it should be intuitive but I never thought to loop like that. Awesome.
Also some minifiers like to use it to omit braces: if (foo) { bar(); baz(); return 42; } -&gt; if(foo)return bar(),baz(),42 IMO outside of for-steps one should not use it, though.
Yeah: isNaN(3); // false isNaN("3"); // false isNaN(NaN); // true typeof NaN; // "number"
I've been non-stop studying this stuff lately. CSP, atoms, cursors, immutability, it's integration into react. Really fascinating stuff that is finally capable of implementing in javascript. I thought closure was just for crazy people who liked LISP. I was so wrong how far ahead of the times they were.
Did the Sierpinski triangle quite a few years ago. JsFiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/Saturnix/2P7WT/ Here's the tutorial: https://ijosephblog.wordpress.com/2012/05/01/drawing-a-sierpinski-triangle-in-html5-canvas-with-javascript/ Not the same thing, but it can be really helpful. Still had VERY MUCH to learn back then, quite a crappy code.
I think it's pretty unclear to do it this way, but it does work. Personally I restrict my loop expressions to the bare minimum required to loop, and the rest happens between the brackets.
React, Babel, and ES6 for me. React to simplify paradigms (the actual implementation is really nice, but the paradigm shift was the biggest help for me). ES6/2015 because it brought a ton of expressive features to the language. And, lastly, Babel because it lets me use ES6/2015 :)

Changes were made to the compiler to provide full support for streaming based build systems like gulp. Both plugins also alleviate problems windows users have had with command length limits.
This is a syntax that exists in C so I assume it came from there.
People love to blame their tools for their failures. 
Technically, the multiple-declaration syntax in a `var` or similar declaration is different from the comma operator.
You're absolutely right, my bad.
&gt;Mozilla toyed with the idea of optional curly braces for functions for a while, but nobody else wanted it, so they decided to back off it. Keep in mind there's coffeescript and all of its descendants, as well as other languages which have none of those braces at all (like basically every functional language). It wouldn't be very fair to say there's no interest in whitespace-significant languages. Additionally, you can write arrow functions without braces if it consists of a single statement: [1, 2, 3, 4].map(x =&gt; x * 2);
Cool stuff, I tried a setup like this then decided the pain and hassle of teaching my parents/in laws/wife to use it outweighed the benefit of customized system. AppleTV for me....
tl;dr: React is the only framework you ever need to learn again! That's the dumbest claim I've ever fucking heard. If I ever see your resume roll by I will make sure to take a shit on it and wrap it up with a bow and mail it to you. 
Just to clarify, here's the Actual Story aboout inheritance and composition. **Inheritance** is a way of making an object whose behaviour depends on another, parent object. Functional programmers look askance at objects in general and inheritance in specific. Even non-functional programmers recognize that inheritance can be confusing and deep chains of inheritance are dangerous and should be avoided at all costs. **Composition** usually refers to chaining functions; it enables a very different, more functional way of constructing complex behaviour, very different than the OOP style that inheritance is based on. When dealing with objects, composition means using references to another object; a protoype chain is *not* an example of composition. Higher Order Components (in React) are an example of object composition; one object wraps another object to provide additional functionality. **Classical Inheritance** is what Java has. If your language has interfaces, abstract classes, base classes, final classes, abstract base classes...you have classical inheritance. JS does not have classical inheritance. **Prototypal Inheritance** is a more flexible form of inheritance. Typically it has been done using the contructor pattern, but their are alternatives. And however it's done you need some sort of function of method you can call which will return a new object that has methods based on some prototype, and data set by the arguments to your creating function. **Constructor Pattern** has traditionally been the most common pattern. In this form, you write a constructor function which initializes an object, then set the function's prototypes to create the pattern, then you call `var newObj = new MyClass(5, 'test');` to create a new object. **Prototypal Pattern** is, despite the name, just one of many ways of doing prototypal inheritance in JS; it works by taking the constructor function and attaching it as a method on the prototype, rather than attaching the prototype to the function. You end up calling `var newObj = MyClass.create(5, 'test');` and the result is *100% the same*. **Other patterns**: There are a bunch, but they all do the same thing; you have a prototype of some sort, and a method or function, and you call the method or function with some new values, and you get a new copy of the base prototype modified to have those values. **Class keyword** splits the difference between the contructor and prototypal patterns; you define the class in a way that looks like the prototypal pattern, but you still have to use the new keyword. But that's just syntax; the result of using it is the same object regardless of pattern. For reference: // constructor pattern function Class1(age, name) { this.age= age; this.name = name; } Class1.prototype.announce = function() { alert(name + ' is ' + age); } // prototypal pattern var Class2 = { announce: function() { alert(name + ' is ' + age); }, create: function(age, name) { var newObj = Object.create(this); newObj.age = age; newObj.name = name; return newObj; } } // class keyword class Class3 = { constructor(age, name) { this.age = age; this.name = name; } announce() { alert(name + ' is ' + age); } } And again, the difference between the result of calling `new Class1(5, 'test')`, `Class2.create(5, 'test')`, and `new Class3(5, 'test')` is nil; all three return the same object with the same prototype chain. The differences are 1) the syntax for defining the object and 2) the syntax for instantiating a new instance of the object. Now given all that, let's look at what Elliot is saying. Translating from his invented jargon into normally accepted terms, he's advocating very strongly for an very OOP style using prototypal inheritance; he does not use or advocate composition. Further, he is strongly in favour of the prototypal for the prototypal pattern, and suggesting that anyone who uses the class keyword or the constructor pattern is a terrible coder, and should not be hired. Let me recap. Elliot is saying that if you write this: const MyClass= { announce() { alert(name + ' is ' + age); }, create(age, name) { var newObj = Object.create(this); newObj.age = age; newObj.name = name; return newObj; } } const person = MyClass.create(5, 'test); You're a good coder, but if you write this: class MyClass= { announce() { alert(name + ' is ' + age); }, constructor(age, name) { this.age = age; this.name = name; } } const person = new MyClass(5, 'test); You're a bad coder, despite the fact that both result in the same object being created with the same prototype chain and with almost identical syntax. Why? Who knows. (Is the class keyword a bad idea? Maybe; it's not terrible to try and standardize JS on a single way of doing prototypal inheritance, but it's such a minimal change it seems like wasted effort. Which makes people like Elliot all the harder to explain; he's getting upset about a change so minor as to barely exist.) Also, it would be awesome if Elliot could stop calling the prototypal pattern of prototypal inheritance "composition" (it's not), and the constructor pattern of prototypal inheritance "classical inheritance" (it's not), and just generally stop making up words under the false impression it makes him sound clever (it doesn't). We now return you to your regularly schedules flame war, already in progress. Edit: Also, it kind of pains me how many people in this thread literally have no idea what the class keyword does, or are confusing the word "class" and "classical".
The equivalent to Dash for Windows or Linux is Zeal.
Found this very interesting | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant Would be good to see how others implement it.
Not much longer Var log = console.log.bind(console)
This was fun: http://imgur.com/X2bK7JQ
Not many alternatives that do static analysis and dead code elimination. There is work on a pure js version, but it is expected to be slower for large code bases.
And in ES7 the proposed binding syntax is simply `var log = ::console.log`
Moment's scope is pretty large though. I actually recently wrote a small library just for manipulating dates (adding, subtracting, setting, displaying, etc.). https://github.com/patrickfatrick/gregorian The payload is quite a bit smaller but also lacks a lot of Moment's functionality (a big one being Moment's locale support).
an anchor by itself without js will go someplace... i mean, if you wanted to you you could redirect the page like that during a click - but without doing anthing else, an anchor when clicked goes somewhere. unless jstree is doing something weird, trapping your clicks before they reach the anchor and overwriting the default behaviour, I'm not very familiar with it... maybe look at the console for errors to see if something has gone wrong. anyway, in your jquery click handler there, `this` will be the dom node associated with the click. it'll has a `href` attribute that you can set `window.location` to if you so desired.
It already exists in C and C++. It is useful for input loops like while (scanf("%d %d", &amp;i, &amp;j), i != j) { ... } that are commonly used in programming competitions. 
Fun fact: This optimization broke Opera's JS engine (back in the Presto days) because it was hitting some limit which would have never been reached in handwritten-written code. I think Uglify is still the only minifier which does this.
You're using the general sibling selector (~), which selects any element after your button. You have to use the adjacent selector (+). The problem with that is that your answer is never directly next to the button, so you have to modify your html/css a bit to make that work: https://jsfiddle.net/fay7q1e6/ Now all the answers are inside of a wrapper, and we're saying "reveal the answer inside of the container that is directly next to the revealed button", which translates to `.revealed + .answers .correct`
Link broken
~ and + are combinators, not selectors. Check this section of the spec which covers all the selector-specific terminology: https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#structure Also note that ~ and + were renamed to *following-sibling* and *next-sibling* to indicate their direction.
Very interesting. I will have to take a look at that.
Ahem.
Here's my first site that I released this week. Something I thought impossible two years ago. Just took some hard work and dedication. www.chancejazz.com It's more geared towards experiences jazz musicians though educational systems are possible too.
Unity
Typescript.
Can Unity Games be fully developed on JavaScript? And, how about platform support for deployment - web,mobile and desktop? From my knowledge, Unity is not totally free to use. Some restrictions apply to deployment of app to public. Isn't it?
Yes, it supports JS.
Thinking about this a little more, you know what? This kind of boils down to developers not properly maintaining comments as if it was an equal part of the code, which I see as a whole separate issue (though a big problem in general)... I'd agree the tail comments makes it more work to rename a method, slightly, but a diligent developer would change the comment along with the code so I'm not sure I see it as an additional problem per se. 
I give up, how is it wrong?
It is not exactly the same, but it is similar enough that the skills are directly transferable, even though some syntax may be slightly different. Unity is the fastest growing game engine in the world, and it supports all features in modern games. Most mobile games are made with it. It is without a doubt the best game engine that supports something close to javascript. The differences are not significant enough to warrant not using it. Source: I am a professional Unity programmer for a game studio.
Ugh. Listen, there's such a thing as "the right tool the the job". JavaScript is *not* the right tool for the job when it comes to making games. Especially if you plan to target platforms other than web browsers. C++, Java and Python would all serve you much better than trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. (Python is the closest to JS, of those three).
It supports all major platforms. Win, Mac, iOS, Android, WebGL, and more. If you use the free version, then there is a splash screen, but that's basically it. The paid version gives you access to cloud tools among other things that only studios will want. You should use Unity. Unity is the dominant engine in all games other than the top AAA titles. Games like Hearthstone, Kerbal Space Program, Rust, Temple Run, AC:Identity and thousands more were all made with Unity. The skills you learn by using Unity are directly transferable to real jobs. Don't listen to people who tell you that it's not EXACTLY js, so you shouldn't use it. While that is technically true, it is so close that you won't be bogged down by your lack of coding skills at all.
HTML5 exports are huge files that aren't going to run very well on lower end hardware. You might be able to make a game in a few 100K with phaser or three.js, but with Unity you're starting out at 30MB+.
I would decide what platform you want to target first, mobile or web. If the browser is your primary target, go with something like Phaser. If mobile is your primary target, maybe look at libGDX, it has a pretty efficient HTML5 exporter (compared to Unity.)
Classic redditor not reading the article. Have a down vote...
If you want to develop for so many different platforms, JS sounds *exactly* like the right tool for the job. There are other options (like Unity, which compiles C#/JS down to C++ and then back to JS for web builds), but since the recent browser updates (dropped NPAPI support) Java is definitely not an option anymore.
That is very interesting, what is that operator called? How would you do `x = y.bind(this)`?
To any that may browse - I'd like to thank everyone for the suggestions however I couldn't get any of them working within the constraints of scratchx. However, I was an idiot and completely neglected to read up further on scratchx rather than on javascript. Turns out you can create an asycnhronous function that automatically gets passed a callback function, and using that you can use setInterval and block until the callback is initiated. 
Hey guys, we're trying out something new -- we want to give you guys a [mostly] unmoderated means to share your js-related links with the sub. Feel free to post your own blog, blog post, website, project, tech demo, extension, app, etc. In short, most guidelines that we usually enforce for submissions are greatly relaxed, with the exception being overt spam (like sales capture pages, Amazon affiliate links, and so on). Please leave feedback here about if you want to see this become a regular thing, and/or how it might be improved.
Ah shit. Haha, it's not. I just couldn't read last night. Sorry about that. My bad... For some reason I thought you had negated something.

Yes, you can, with things like cordova/node-webkit. You'd be relying on the webview's WebGL (or canvas fallback.) 2D would probably run pretty smoothly, 3D games may need some optimization to run well. I wrote a simple [bowling game](http://www.spacejack.ca/bowling/) for mobile using three.js and cannon.js for physics. It runs *pretty* well on my Nexus 5, but you can tell it struggles a bit when you strike a lot of pins. New iPhones are super fast though. There's also [Ejecta](http://impactjs.com/ejecta) which may run better than Cordova. If mobile/native platforms are your primary target, then at the moment you may still be better off with libGDX or Unity, but javascript isn't a great language choice for those; you'd want to use Java, Kotlin or C#.

That's a *horrible* TL;DR. If that is your summary it shows you learned nothing.
Better yet, add a mechanical rule that says "Don't chain ! with other urinary operators (other than itself)." The problem here isn't following mechanical coding standards, but people trying to play code gold in their code base (please don't do this)

It would probably be more conducive to the conversation to share your specific concerns in this context; Java does have somewhat of a bad rep, but I don't think it's enough to say "don't use it, ever". For example, one of [if not the] most popular IDE's, Webstorm, is built with Java.
Until 3.0
But how fast is blazing-fast? Is that faster than really-fast? or just very-fast?
No benchmarks needed. Just look at your actual app. If switching to raw typed arrays would make those areas of your application which use streams *indefinitely* faster, would a user be able to see any difference? E.g. if your app takes 5% CPU and the stream stuff accounts for 10% of that, making that part twice as fast won't change anything. It's only worthwhile if these areas take a much larger chunk of the used CPU time.
It's a bit hard to actually help with a screenshot. Next time post to something like jsbin, jsfiddle, codepen, etc. Here's some random observations. --- You are mixing up `=` and `==` in your `if` statements. * `=` is assignment (`var x = 5`) * `==` is equality (`playcount == 0`) --- You can use the modulo operator to determine if a number is divisible by 2, instead of explicilty spelling out odd/even numbers: * `var isEven = (playcount % 2) == 0;` --- `playcount + 1` is an expression that does nothing. You probably want `playcount = playcount + 1` (or the shorter `playcount++`). --- You can simplify your code by getting rid of the `totalplayers` variable. You can just use `players.length` instead. This way, you don't need to worry about keeping that variable in sync. --- p.s. Are you using npm or is this just vanilla JS? If you're using npm you can borrow [one](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shuffle-array) [of](https://www.npmjs.com/package/array-shuffle) the [many](https://www.npmjs.com/package/knuth-shuffle) Fisher-Keats array shuffle implementations 
Stream events are probably a very small overhead when compared with the rest of your application / datasize (assuming, since you're working with audio -- I think that's a safe assumption though). Benchmark it if you want to be sure, but if there's no observable difference, you may already have your answer. On the other hand, using properly typed arrays may be more useful as far as memory usage goes. I'm not sure you can allocate int16s while working with streams (I could be wrong, I've never tried). What's the use case for your streams, anyways? Do you just load the audio file directly into an array, or can you make use of chunks of audio data? For example, can you dynamically display the earlier parts of the waveform as the file loads, or do you need the whole thing?
Would love to see some critique and comparison from users or Redux. Just started using redux about 2 months ago and it really help reduce the code required on a project in which I used Reflux.
This reminds me of [CCSS](http://gridstylesheets.org/guides/ccss/).
On mobile, so forgive me. Randomizing an array: randArr = Arr.sort((a,b) =&gt; { .5 - Math.random() }); Splitting into two arrays: var team1 = []; var team2 = []; randArr.forEach((player, i) =&gt; { if (i % 2 === 0) { team2.push(player); } else { team1.push(player); } }); 
Openfl/haxeflixel are game engines though
I made the career switch about 2 years ago. I did a short program at a technical college and then found an entry level role. It was a rough 25% pay cut from my previous job, but my pay has increased 50% since. If you are committed to continually increasing your skill as a developer, put effort in to networking and smart about which companies you join, you should be able to quickly get your salary back up even if you have to take an initial pay cut. Not all entry level roles are created equal, and do not underestimate the power of brand recognition and networking. I didn't go for the job offer with the highest pay, instead chose the job where I would have the chance to work with some really smart people and learn a lot from them. Bonus was that the company has a good reputation in my area so has name recognition on the resume. Other bonus is that those smart colleagues have also moved on to roles at big name companies and that's now part of my professional network.
Thanks for the feedback. Yeah that's the balance I'm working on. At the moment the responsibility is on the musician to know or look it up. Considering a page on each scale and chord with brief description and some examples. The other thing could be a level system that slowly increases the difficulty. 
I used to get like that when life was a grind. Once I started getting more high level with my stuff I need the most up to date and first to market on things. I settled in with a corp....they pay my dues and now I have first access and huge libraries....almost overstimulation. If I ever hit an angle that is very unique I will pay out of pocket. It is worth it....to me it was a turning point in my career. I can respobd faster than a large portion of my org and because of that I have doubled my salary receiving two promotions in under two years. I will admit....I am living my passion so it isn't akways work to me. That and I watch these services as if therly were TV Series....many times over and over
Best resource for this stuff is MDN. So google "TROUBLESOME_TERM_HERE mdn" and you get: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach Just a heads up, the `=&gt;` syntax is for a newer version of JavaScript called ES6. It's just a shorter way of defining a function. This shorthand is called an [arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions). In prior versions of JS, the first line would be equivalent to this: `randArr.forEach(function(player, i) {` (For more info on whether you can use this or not see the [ES6 compatibility table](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/))
I used Phaser with Cocoon and I was able to make an asteroids game.
Since we need to make it responsive, small chunks of Audio (5-10) second chunks are fed through an audio pipeline, eventually going to the sound card. I'm applying transformations by piping the PCM chunks through transformation streams. So for example if I want to adjust the volume, it is piped to a volume stream, then maybe I need to mute one channel of audio, ten I pipe that data to another stream. Eventually it's piped to the sound card. We don't want to load the entire file at once, because the transformations take time. So if the user wants to adjust the volume again, it happens very quickly. If the chunks are too large then the UI becomes less responsive. My idea was that streams were the approach to do this, rather than slicing an array of int16 pack data, passing it to each audio transformation step. Since streams already does this, I didn't see the benefit of reinventing the wheel, when there's a library meant to do this. I wanted to get some feedback if there was any reason not to use a stream. Other than the perceived overhead. Forgot the second part, yes as the file is transcoded we display the waveform in chunks as its loaded
You probably want to look at [Bower](http://bower.io) but plenty of people use npm on the frontend as well, often in combination with [Browserify](http://browserify.org).
I am using three.js and web workers to render arbitrary dimensional functions in real time using marching cubes. It isn't done but it is usable. [GitHub](https://github.com/csp256/IsoVis/) - [Sample image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csp256/IsoVis/master/image2.png) I am not very good with JavaScript though. I know I can use renderer.domElement.toDataURL('image/png') to get get the current renderer output as a base64 string which begins something like data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0K...... My question is, how can I actually save that on my computer without manual interaction? I would like to be able to create a script to save out a series of such images to numbered files on my computer (to then compress into a gif using an external tool). I am willing to run a local webserver to accomplish this (I have Windows &amp; Linux partitions), but I warn you that I have absolutely no idea how any of the standard web technologies (node, ajax, jQuerry, etc) work or how to use them. Could anyone help?
Here's another cool one: `--&gt;`, the "goes to" operator. Example: var i = arr.length; while (i --&gt; 0) { console.log(arr[i]); }
There is a file called "specification.markdown" in this repository which contains basic documentation. The part where it is anti-CSS is where the CSS positioning, classes and selectors are not used. The clock app might look as it has CSS properties, because it was designed to feel that way. But you would quickly realize that it not the case when you see that along with the "left" and "right" property there is also a "centerX". The engine computes the position of each element and used position "absolute" with CSS3 "transform" to position, and if the browser is old and does not have CSS3 like IE8, the engine will fall back to "top" and "left" positioning. Yes TODO app is 1000 lines, but most lines are closing braces "}". Since the whole app is one object you can split it up using variables. Such as: LAY.run({ "Header": { props: { width: LAY.take("/", "width"), height: 300, text: "App", textAlign: "center" } }, "Content": { props: { top: LAY.take("../Header", "bottom"), width: LAY.take("/", "width") } } }); could be refactored out into 2 variables. One for header: var header = { props: { width: LAY.take("/", "width"), height: 300, text: "App", textAlign: "center" } }; Another for content: var content = { props: { top: LAY.take("../Header", "bottom"), width: LAY.take("/", "width") } }; And then run as: LAY.run({ "Header": header, "Content": content }); Using this above method TodoMVC could be split up into as many files as possible. The framework also offers inheritance using the $inherit key, for better maintainability. The problem with famo.us was that it was not meant to create web apps in the conventional sense. It focused highly on transformations, and subsequently did not even offer transitions/animations for anything but position and opacity. This framework uses requestAnimationFrame for transitions just as famo.us did, however it will let you transition anything, even colors. Finally the main problem which the framework is trying to solve is "constraints". Every attribute in the application can be a constraint for another attribute. There are no tutorials about how to use the framework, and this is not a good thing, and I must put up a tutorial, and create better documentation. Thanks for the questions. 
I'll look into this. Can you open an issue on the repo?
I don't see any difference between the module pattern and the revealing module pattern examples. The privacy of local variables is maintained in both cases, it seems?
I've been waiting for 3.0 to jump into phaser again. They've extended the release date a few times. I'm excited for the es2015 support. 
&gt; Thats why the js tree is there because without the jstree everything works perfectly This makes no sense at all. Why do you need the jstree if everything works perfectly without it?
I understand that, I don't want it on my development machine either.
Yeah this is a quite poorly written article, he doesn't go into great detail, and is wrong on a few points of some of these patterns.
I'd add one more to this list ... in fact I would make it the most important. I'll preface this with the disclaimer that module patterns can be important if you are writing code to be used by 3rd parties, but there is no need to do it for internal code. note what methods/variables are public and having coding standards. use standard APIs for object creation. Use bundlers/minifiers to produce module code with private members. Most source to source compilers or bundlers like webpack, browserify, rollup, GCC can take your normal code and turn it into an AMD, CJS, IIFE, whatever format. // _fields are private class Example { constructor(name, x, y) { this.name = name; this._x = x; this._y = y; } doSomething(a, b) { return a * x + b * y; } _secret() { // some private method } } And to make it a singleton... just export a `new`'d version.
Excellent, thanks!
You seem to be talking as if 'making games' is a single job. I think that's a big mistake. Nobody's expecting to see the next Halo or Crysis written in Javascript, but on the other hand, the tools used for games like that are way overkill if you're just making a little 2D platformer or whatever. Also, I wouldn't say Python is 'the closest to Javascript'. It has some similarities with Javascript, but it also has some differences where C++ and/or Java don't. At best you could say it's similar to Javascript in terms of the difficulty and nuance of its usage, but that's a fairly abstract (if also useful) comparison.
The reason I don't consider JS to be the right tool here is because of its poor support for common abstraction mechanisms and modularisation; it's equally performance (at least for anyone who doesn't put a lot of work into optimising it, and use all the fancy new bells and whistles like WebGL and typed arrays); and the basically absent library support (at least compared to other languages). And outside of syntax, I'm quite happy to say that Python is closer than Java is closer than C++ (having used all three extensively). Besides, if you want to learn game dev, the smartest thing you can do is go download the latest UDK (it's free!).
What does webpack do? The top comment says I can get all my dependencies from NPM which sounds great since I already have it for my gulp dependencies. 
I'm right there with you. I started learning react a few days ago and stumbled on redux and it's consumed my life since. I've never enjoyed JS so much before in my life
Hi /u/Sir1Afifi, as others have mentioned, please don't post titles in all caps. Thanks!
you don't necessarily have to bundle them. If you're using a lot of common external libraries like jquery and only updating them occasionally then use your `package.json` to generate a html5 manifest file. The browsers will save them and pull them locally, which is much quicker than pulling them from a CDN. There's a brief introduction [here](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/appcache/beginner/)
Here's a rather nice one: [Langton's Ant by Fabrice Weinberg](http://codepen.io/FWeinb/pen/CJpjl)
That's fun. I haven't seen multiple ants running at the same time which is an interesting twist. I'm curious why the ants appear "wide" (not square)? Also, I would have liked some stop/start controls and maybe the ability to seed the field to see what patterns emerge.
bower is dead i think.
Does this make more sense? https://jsbin.com/yezewopabe/2/edit?html,js,output
~~In this instance did you just change randPlayer to player?~~ That cleared up the issue of the players becoming numbers, thank you! The problem with the players being not random still occurs, however. Typing !teams.random multiple times just repeats the same players, but multiple times and on the same team. Restarting the bot shows one instance of each player, however each name gets put on the same team every time. Name &amp; Username are always on team 1, Jaakey is always on team 2.
Realized after I wrote it, sorry. Edited last comment.
The rendered image dimensions are static, the output dimensions are not.
I'd recommend staying away from browserify, webpack has a lot more features, much less buggy and adopted by a lot more library developers. I used browserify for a while and was surrounded by headaches, now on webpack haven't had a single issue.
I used [shuffle-array](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shuffle-array) which you linked. Adding 'players =' before it fixed the problem of it not being random, however typing !teams.random multiple times without clearing seems to just duplicate the players variable and display it twice. Though this shouldn't be a problem since I plan to clear it every time anyway. edit: can't really test this until tomorrow when some of the users on the discord server get on but I believe it should work from the outputs I'm seeing. Thank you so so much for all of your help!
NPM or JSPM will handle this stuff for you really easily. I would not use Bower at this point.
bower install....
What drove me to A/B testing in the first place is that it would be an opportunity to leave a technology centered role and straddle the fence with marketing/business. I saw this as a chance to use my technology experience to voice business decisions, learn some strategy, and maybe voice some concern for things I perceived to be bad decisions.
Very cool and all but I'm curious to know how the SEO compatibility feature works. I'm imagining that it still does client-side rendering like every other JS framework which is the crux of the problem. If you turn off JS, you wouldn't be able to navigate through the site. Or perhaps it depends on you having all your markup generated ahead of time? If this app framework solved client-side seo problems then I'm very interested.
This is what npm is made for.
&gt;The author of Redux suggests using multiple connected components if performance is a concern, but I'm not a huge fan of that option. It still means that every child component of a connected component will re-render way more often than it needs to, unless each child component looks for its data to change in shouldComponentUpdate. This is not entirely accurate. Components generated by `connect()` have a rather strict `shouldComponentUpdate()` implementation by default so they might actually speed up your app (but they also assume you don't have deep mutations).
All transducer and channels are within the framework, so actually user of the framework don't necessarily need to know all about csp, what user have to do is only provide a transform(in this case, define a action) for channel to transduce
It scales well because you can separate concerns with reducers just like you previously separated them with stores. It is performant because it unlike Flux embraces immutability, and thus it's easy to * only re-render when something *really* changed with aggressive `shouldComponentUpdate()` * subscribe to something more granular than a Flux store (e.g. a specific field or a memoized computation on top of several fields)
Hmm. OK thank you for that :)
It felt like African vs European swallow debate.
This looks useful, and the API is nice. I will try this out in an app I am developing. Thanks.
hmmm, I’d say it was probably my thigh actually (front pocket)
*So* much clearer: pending--; if (!pending) 
I doubt SVG would be much faster because it rerenders the whole thing on each change per frame, as far as I have seen. The only thing in the browser that takes advantage of the fast render path that prevents rerender and instead just composites layers on the gpu are html layers (divs mostly) that are positioned with transforms, scales, and rotations. So, if you wanted to drag a curve, render it exclusively to its own canvas and hide that curve in the real canvas, then drag the div containing the new canvas by modifying the css transforms.
&gt;[**"Transducers" by Rich Hickey [45:01]**](http://youtu.be/6mTbuzafcII) &gt;&gt;People keep implementing map, filter and other fundamental algorithms in different contexts - eagerly over collections, over lazy sequences, in parallel, over enumerables/iterables, over observables, over channels/streams etc. In addition to duplication of effort, this yields bloated APIs, and, when implemented in the classic way, often involves the creation of expensive intermediate objects/values that &gt; [*^Strange ^Loop*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_QIfHvN9auy2CoOdSfMWDw) ^in ^Science ^&amp; ^Technology &gt;*^44,055 ^views ^since ^Sep ^2014* [^bot ^info](http://www.reddit.com/r/youtubefactsbot/wiki/index)
D3 can do stuff like that, and learning D3 is something you can put on a resume. http://blog.visual.ly/creating-animations-and-transitions-with-d3-js/ D3 is generally associated with graphs and datavis, but you can use it to do arbitrary transformations on SVGs. 
I work on an app with a lot of real-time and data processing, 40ms is not such a reasonable trade-off comparing this with Redux, but you wrote it's being worked on so just wanted to note (as there are devs that actually are in need of high performance in JS apps), but the library is still very nice and it is truly simplified, good job on it. . Would like to know, what do you think on not having to manually add interfaces (`this.bind...`) in the component's scope?, so it would be something like this: class TodoItem extends React.Component { state = { editing : false } render () { let { todo } = this.props // return ... &lt;input className="toggle" type="checkbox" checked={ todo.completed } onChange={() =&gt; this.dispatch (MainSection, 'complete', { id : todo.id })} /&gt; } } export default mixin (TodoItem, actions) actions moved to the `mixin`function removing the need to bind it every time in `componentDidMount`. And as it seems that actions don't change they could also be added as a static property on the component (although i would still prefer that to be done by the mixin function)
Fabricjs uses a double-canvas system where the object you are manipulating is moved into it's own canvas context so that the entire canvas doesn't need to be redrawn. There are a couple of robust SVG libraries out there (EaselJS, SnapSVG, BonsaiJS) and two.js is target-agnostic, but the general consensus seems to be that the canvas approach is more performant.
It is expected, as well as everything in the comment I was replying to. I do understand what is happening inside, but it does not change a fact that things like [Wat](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) are still hilarious to me.
Thanks, I saw that library a couple of times and have been meaning to give it a shot. It's about 150kb from this download, which would eat a lot of the ad's filesize, is it worth using do you think for a small drawing and manipulating drawings game/ad? Do you think it would actually perform better versus straight canvas drawing like what paper does? Sorry this stuff feels pretty advanced to me, is it basically creating dom/svg elements in code and manipulating them vs canvas bitmap data?
only thing I have seen avoid lag on moving dom elements is requestAnimationFrame() and the best implementation I have seen is greensock 
It's a common thing to harp on for people who aren't that familiar with the actual specifications so I feel like it's something we should dispel as being 'why JavaScript sucks' and instead explain that `+inf === -inf // true` Would be the real wat (because NaN can represent both of these concepts.) Mathematics when you get into infinite series, and infinite/infinitesimal magnitudes gets very strange (my favorite: conditionally convergent infinite series an be re-ordered to sum to any real number, making infinite sums not associative for example). This complexity (or 'wat-ness') has to arise in any system which wishes to express the concept of infinity and/or a number of other non-intuitive concepts which break down our standard formulations of equality. Though the real 'wat' of the universe is the Axiom of Choice's implications.
Was this back in the days when the Opera docs said it was sometimes better to use an explicit `String` object than to just call methods on a string and use the temporary wrapper object?
Thankfully, that one works as expected :) The problem with "JS SUX" is that people jump right into stuff without learning it properly: "silly make-spider-on-the webpage-language that looks like C/JAVA, how hard could it be". That was what I did and things like that were really annoying. With some experience, came understanding, but it would really help to read a book or specs first.
This only works if something that can be assigned to is on the left side, because `i --&gt; 0` is parsed as `i-- &gt; 0`; I also think something like this is why ES6 didn't adopt CoffeeScript's thin-arrow function syntax.
Little tip I got from this subreddit was to keep your frontend packages in a separate package.json that's located in your public folder. So you'll have one app package.json and one frontend package.json.
The demos don't work on my iPhone. :/
&gt; If I change the min-height of the frame Why is it a frame? You got jQuery on your page. Just use that to post some data.
Little-known trick, you can also do it with the `i` on the right side. Most people think you only need to change the direction of the arrow, but you also need to change the `0` to `-1`, because the first bit of the 0 is the directionality bit. So you end up with: var i = arr.length; while (-1 &lt;-- i) { console.log(arr[i]); }
[Bower](http://bower.io/). Its stated purpose is to be for the frontend what npm is for the backend. I really don't understand where all this hate for it is coming from. It is - today - the recommended package manager for jQuery, React, Angular - pretty much every popular front-end package.
You are confusing two very different uses of "reference". The "Reference" in the ECMAspec is a concept *only for the spec*. It has nothing to do with actual implementation, it's used to describe behavior/outcome. Words are regularly reused in different contexts in human language. When an employer asks you for *references*, are you going to try to hand him a *numeric computer memory location*? :-)
WOOOAH my BLAZING FAST MICRO SERVICE CLOUD ISOMORPHIC REACTIVE SUPER SINGLE PAGE AJAX 2.0 APPLICATION ENGINE ! CHECK IT OUT IT'S SO AAAAAAAAAAAAWESOME ! 
that is a really good idea, puting those into mixin is exactly what I'm gonna to do:) yeah, performance issue is also the issue i'm trying to solve. But still,I reckon 50ms for 1K messages processing is reasonable for normal clientside app.
Had to do this with one of my current projects, and it works pretty well. It definitely requires a little bit more tinkering to get things just right. What we decide to do on the project is overwrite the save/fetch functions of the models/collections as there are separate endpoints for saving and getting data. This proved to be a lot more straightforward than overwriting Backbone's sync. One thing I do recommend though, is to ensure that you're always returning promises in those methods.
Before pushing to entities in SpatialGrid.retrieve, should you not check whether the entity to be added is already contained therein to avoid double counting entities spanning multiple squares? Or is that somehow desirable?
&gt;is it worth using do you think for a small drawing and manipulating drawings game/ad? Certainly not. D3 is a huge library that has tons of extra stuff for charting and data vis. Stuff you don't need. The only thing you need to manipulate SVG elements is element.setAttribute. But If you need the convenience of a library you could use something much lighter such as [SVG.js (50k)](https://github.com/wout/svg.js/blob/master/dist/svg.min.js) or [Snap.svg (75k)](https://github.com/adobe-webplatform/Snap.svg/blob/master/dist/snap.svg-min.js) &gt;Do you think it would actually perform better versus straight canvas drawing like what paper does? If you are experience lag on dragging shapes, it would makes sense that SVG might perform better, since the browser may be able to split the shapes into separate layers and composite them on the GPU using transforms. This way you wouldnt have to do any repaints during drag. A 2d canvas context will have to repaint every shape on every frame of the drag. (unless your renderer is doing some advanced invalidation technique, which I doubt paper.js does for you)
Thank you for suggesting event delegation. Seems very useful and I'll check it out once I clear this problem up in my head. Still learning and don't want to leave any bases uncovered. 
Thank you for helping me clear that up! Makes a lot more sense calling a function in the loop instead of stuffing all that code in there. Much obliged. 
Super cool, and thanks for the tutorial.
This sounds like a truly terrible idea. Java....no.....stahp....y u do dis? 
Thanks, I was trying to find a simple memory cache that was both serializable and instance able for some of my other projects and couldn't find any. It also will persist key expiries even when serialized which comes in handy if you plan on serializing and rehydrating later for sessions and such.
How would that work? Would I just create a folder called 'lib' and 'npm init' inside there?
Because in the first example the variable `i` resides in the global scope, so when `console.log(i)` is called from inside the event handler, it'll go upwards to look for `i`, and find `i` sitting in the global scope. This `i` has the value 9 because by the time you click on the button, the `for` loop has long since finish running (technically speaking, it is impossible for the for loop to *not* finish running when you click on the button) In the second example, a separate `i` is held inside the scope of `doSomething` (JS uses function scopes) for each iteration of the `for` loop, and so the problem in the first example does not occur. 
The JDK has been shipped with a JS engine and generic scripting support (JSR 223) for over 9 years.
If you've ever used Rhino you'd know that most of its allocated JS objects are pinned into permgen, meaning that they never get freed by the garbage collector. I wouldn't hold out much hope that Nashorn is different. See http://www.mirthcorp.com/community/issues/browse/MIRTH-1627 for one example. That's the main reason this is a bad idea.
Try [snap](http://snapsvg.io/)
PostgreSQL had hstore, which is arguably better than JSON way before MongoDB. JSON isn't that great. It duplicates it's keys on every record and very wasteful. It also can't reasonable represent date/time fields or anything other than numbers and strings. XML is better, as it defined a DTD which make integrations easier to document. JSON is pretty lame, honestly and it's not human readable beyond a point.
ECMAScript is the name of the standard. ES6 or ESS2015 refers to the current version. JavaScript is the trademarked name owned by Oracle. V8 is Chrome's JS engine. It's also used by Node.js.
It never occured to me that the Java in javascript would be also owned by Oracle. I mean, shouldn't they be suing everybody by now?
np. If you have any questions on how event delegation works, feel free to ask.
Look up event delegation. It's simple, code looks cleaner, is more professional, and etc.
You can use dozens of languages in the JVM. I don't really see how not being able to use JS would improve anything.
Maybe Nashorn's a safer option then. I'd still be cautious about mixing the two environments though. Unless there's been an analysis into how the JVM GC deals with JS objects I'd be cautious about using this for production. 
*This* is exactly what we should be doing instead of trying to stay clear of all libraries ("vanilla") or focusing too much on file size ("micro libraries"). Using any kind of library is perfectly fine if you don't ship the parts you aren't actually using.
There's still much better ways to accomplish this, but here's one that only changes as little as needed: https://jsfiddle.net/86r49zvr/
You should throw up an example of this and please give us a TL;DR, I can't be bothered to read all of this. (I did take a look at the source, it appears you just change the page when the location hash changes?) Why not use a framework like React + React Router or Angular2?
example: window.onload: class list extends web.ts.List&lt;string&gt;{ protected view(){ this.reset() return null// just use the current document as the view. } public add(item:T){ var elm:document.createElement("div"); elm.innerText=item; document.getElementById("list").appendChild(elm) } public reset(){ var elm:document.createElement("div"); document.getElementById("list").innterHTML="" } } var strs:string[]=["a","b","c"]; new list&lt;string&gt;(strs); //Do the operation
Along with multiple bundle files, this looks a lot like Google Closure Compiler's cross module code motion. That's good, it's one thing that ClojureScript has that I'd really like JS to have.
**This is the right answer** This is coincidentally solved by event delegation, but at a fundamental level it is caused by the JS callstack, and it is solved by proper usage of closures. OP, please look up and try to understand closures. There's a GREAT lecture on the topic. I think it's this but don't have the time to check: http://www.dev-metal.com/javascript-really-works-introduction-javascript-call-stack-philip-roberts-20min-video/
&gt; That is not the point. Yep; this is why I recommended filing a bug. ;) &gt; I probably didn't have to reinvent the wheel, but it would have taken just as long to bend an existing solution to fit a niche case. I guess we can agree to disagree; but I could never contribute to an OSS project with insanely complex test/lint scripts and such a clear sign of NIH. P.S. Tape and ava have nothing to do with UI.
That is good to hear. I would still say that D3's API is little bit weird and unintuitive if you don't need the charting stuff and are just using it for DOM manip. 
You can use [hihat](https://github.com/Jam3/hihat) to blend the Web APIs (like canvas) with Node.js APIs (like [fs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html)). For example: - [writing canvas to process.stdout](https://github.com/Jam3/hihat#save-canvas-2d-to-png-image) - [tiling a folder of images with canvas + `fs`](https://gist.github.com/mattdesl/59214e0f0ee8b3ae614f)
It should work for the ES6 module flavor of loadash. So, in the not too distant future, when everyone is using ES6 modules, it should *just work*™.
Thanks. There ought to be a XKCD for it! John I still haven't received your references. But I sent them. John that was just some random numbers with alphabets. Duh, Hexadecimal. That's not what it means in human language. 
Is it me or is Spain dominating the WebGL game?
si, si
Though if you're new to bundling webpack's documentation isn't all that great. JSPM is much easier and much more frictionless to get something basic going quickly.
It's not [quite dead](https://github.com/bower/bower/pull/1748#issuecomment-156709909). They're just looking for more funding and contributors.
Doesn't this ruin caching though? 
Yes it does. It’s a trade-off.
U could still use closure without clojure- although that sounds quite awful 
Um, i can't really tell if that's sarcasm. I thought fabric.js would suit me nicely but that's only from reading around the descriptions of several canvas libraries.
Really enjoyed that. Thanks for posting a great resource!
We made the switch. npm offers everything bower does, with npm 3 you no longer have nested depenencies. Hen working with ES2015 imports work with node modules out of the box. In addition, npm offers way more than simple dependency management. And it simply reduces the number of tools the developers have to know about.
Ask yourself what number, when squared makes -4.
Well we decided to stay with the current non-parallel configuration since the project is going live soon and a code freeze took place. Thanks anyway, I think solution 2 would have been perfect since we are returning a function from our webpack.configs already :-)
Why are all of the videos from that conference so cringe-worthy? It hurts every time one of them shows up in my playlist. Oh how far it's fallen.
Bower seems redundant these days, NPM has all possible packages, both for client and server side. Webpack simply allows to bundle them nicely into a single file, making project structure modular and more mature comparing to what we had several years ago when all dependencies were included inside HTML pages through `script` tags.
I just want to step in and make sure you are clearly aware that document stores are old-tech; not new - your file system is essentially a document store. I worked on a document store based project 20-ish years ago. It's good to know about, so you can truly appreciate why we don't use them. Other commenters are right, this is quite simply a failure to learn from the past, doomed to repeat it scenario. The majority of JS is this. Ever heard of Livewire? Server side JS, created in 1995. 
 function divide(a,b) { return Number.isInteger(a) &amp;&amp; Number.isInteger(b) ? Math.floor(a/b) : a/b; } 
Then I'd say i know that. I should have mentioned that a and b can be numbers in string representation. The code I posted does exactly what I want it to do, but I was wondering if there is a prettier way to do it.
I'm not sure what you are trying to achieve, but I think you perhaps need to rethink the structure, something more along the lines of this: plotOptions: { line: { dataLabels: { enabled: true }, enableMouseTracking: false } }, series: [ { name: 'Avg Temp', data: [87.24, 82.24, 75.24] }, { name: 'Max Temp', data: [87.24, 90.24, 80.24] } ] With the plotOptions.ling.dataLabels property, you can also write a custom function to return the key value if you would rather display that. Hope that helps.

No example? I don't use Medium and I have no idea what you mean by that.
It's difficult to switch back to HTML when you do some JADE for a while.
I'm not sure if it's the browser, but the quotation marks encapsulating the first "records" tag are kinda curly... Try pasting the data into jsonlint.com and validating it, then try again. Also you have an extra comma before the end of the array. 
[Custom Highlight](https://github.com/Tapha/Custom-Highlight) - A simple, open source text highlighter that allows you to add custom functions to it
&gt; The canvas will be displaying a background image of maximum 30k x 30k pixels This won't run well in the browser. That is huge.... as in about 45mb of memory just creating the canvas before doing anything and will reach 900mb of memory pretty quickly. Consider the history, histogram, layers, saved selections, and various other features that adds up. Even on a computer with 8gb of memory once a browser reaches above 1.5gb of memory it starts to crawl. Once it reaches above 2gb of memory it takes (in some cases) 20 seconds for a button click to fire its event handler.
Not to be too rude, but "[I have no idea how to do it] ...but i have a very good idea of the application i want to create. " is the phrase every business major tells their CS friends in college. If you're serious about this, you should maybe not ask about libraries just yet and start by breaking your domain down into smaller problem chunks, then go from there. Don't use libraries as a crutch, learn how canvas works first and see if it's even feasible. It sounds like /u/achen2345 gave you some good feedback about feasibility already.
I prefer Handlebars myself. Clean and easy to use.
Why use you handlebars, what it gives you that another template engine not give you?
This is a really good point. I've built a handful of games with Phaser over the last year or two, and I'm extremely fond of it. Good docs, plenty of examples, and there's almost always something in the API that'll get you your desired result, Phaser's just brimming with useful bits and pieces. However, the broader "...work on web, mobile, and desktop" is something WELL worth watching out for. As soon as you add "web", you're opening yourself to an experience that'll appear on both desktop and mobile, and a fair degree of fragility. Mobile performance on browser games is really poor at this moment in time - top of the range devices capable of all sorts of magic will balk at even modest demos. There are also lots of little quirks such as WebGL tending to make devices run very hot, handling things like device orientation changes is a often janky nightmare, and browser comparability issues can be extremely lumpy (hello stock Android browser!). These things are soluble, just about, but they won't leave you feeling massively confident in what you're making. With a few games under my belt I wouldn't suggest making them unless you're a browser vendor with something to plug, unless you're targeting something very specific, or unless you're under pressure from your seniors (brace yourself for people with mobile native expectations). I've knocked out a couple of games for people who "must have this thing", when my advice was that the user experience can be so poor that it's debatable whether or not online games are worthy projects to invest in at the minute. Now, I don't have much experience with using Phaser to target native mobile beyond a few afternoon's fiddling around with Phonegap. What I found is that even running a Phaser game through a webview seemed to eek out a bit more performance form a device. That might be nonsense, but more broadly I would say that you'll be much more successful building JS games if you try to isolate your platforms as much as you can. Desktop, fine. Native mobile, good. Blend everything together, clench your teeth. Speaking of JS games, I'm reminded of Unity (which I've only watch videos on - I've never made anything with it). IIRC Unity games can be written in JS, so if you're looking for more performant mobile experiences then maybe that's worth a look. As an aside, Unity is one of those tools that I've long been after an opportunity to explore, it looks facinating. That's the massively abridged version dashed out over a sandwich, and I've glossed over a whole bunch of stuff. Bottom line? Enjoy Phaser (or whatever else), creating even small games is an absolute treat... At least until reality arrives, and then the experience is more often than not disappointing. Lastly, the enthusiast in me wants to be more positive than that. Some day it'll change, I'm sure of that, but not for a while yet. *Edit:* Bit o' spelling. *Edit:* Turns out that what Unity refers to as Javascript isn't [quite that](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/UnityScript_versus_JavaScript), nor does it appear to be a hugely popular choice. So don't look to me for the best way into Unity (TBH I'd bite the bullet and pick up C#) :)
I would recommend [jspm](http://jspm.io/). It works with any registry and github.
Jade. It makes writing html fun again. Well, maybe not. But as someone who hates all template languages, Jade is the exception.
&gt; (hello stock Android browser!) On the bright side, as of Android 5.0, the stock browser is actually just Chromium, and it updates via the Play store. Granted, that doesn't help with 4.4 and below though, which is still the majority... Anyway, for the most part, lots of good points. Unity is developed mostly with C#, by the way, which is actually a very pleasant language, and a lot more powerful than JavaScript (though I am very fond of prototype languages like JS myself).

Were you thinking a full canvas of 30k x 30k? I was thinking a fixed canvas of 1k x 1k pixels, when fully zoomed out the resolution will be reduced.
I always was a big fan of Handlebars until I migrated to React. 
[Marko](http://markojs.com/) &gt; Marko is a fast and lightweight HTML-based templating engine that compiles templates to readable Node.js-compatible JavaScript modules, and it works on the server and in the browser. It supports streaming, async rendering and custom tags. I'm the author, but I think it is awesome. If you are using Node.js or a JavaScript module bundler then I think you will find Marko to be a perfect fit and it has a simple HTML-based syntax. Also see: - https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs#templating - http://www.slant.co/topics/51/~javascript-templating-engines - [MarkoJS Screencasts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZUgs-F38XXQJBxA58UqnwTVMZS_uza_C)

Microsoft officially supports bower for client side dependencies. There's nothing wrong with it. If it works for your project then why switch? Don't let people talk you into using tools that don't fit your project. 
Singleton; untestable garbage.
I'm not sure but you seem to have a trailing comma in the "series" array which shouldn't be there. Don't know if that makes a difference.
Heh, well you have a lot of reading ahead of you. :) With `hihat` you could write a script that streams your ThreeJS canvas to hundreds of files on your local file system. However, you will probably need to know a bit about Node.js, npm, `require()` statements, and so forth before you have a working solution. I am not sure of a pure browser solution that allows you to write images to the file system without limitation.
This is sort of insane but mostly amazing.
The code above doesn't seem to work for me. I made a fiddle with your test cases, and all the calls to divide return 1. Are you saying if you modified your code to accept numbers as strings it would work? https://jsfiddle.net/v4r1jpor/
To avoid ambiguity let's call the server-side code that deals with rendering the app the "frontend server" and the part that provides the API the "backend server". The "frontend" consists of the client (i.e. browser) and frontend server, the "backend" consists of the backend server and database (or third party APIs or whatever black box deals with the data storage). You can of course have everything that isn't in the browser run on the same machine. For small projects this is usually sufficient. Just think of traditional Apache+PHP+MySQL setups -- same idea. Let's look at a production app I'm maintaining: Everything is on one server. The externally visible port 80 is answered by nginx. Nginx serves some static assets (images, etc) and acts as a reverse proxy to the application server (locally listening on, say, port 8000). The application server acts as the frontend server: it routes certain requests through the frontend code and spits out the pre-rendered app. It also serves the client-side JavaScript (because it's part of the same codebase and mostly identical with the server-side part). Additionally the application server proxies requests to a certain sub-URL (e.g. /api/...) to the backend server. This could be done by nginx but doing this in the same JS server makes it easier to deal with pre-fetching (i.e. API calls necessary to render the frontend, which on the client would usually mean AJAX). The backend server itself is actually a small HTTP API [hosted directly inside the database](https://foxx.arangodb.com). But it could be some external API service like [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com) or even just a thin PHP wrapper around a MySQL database (which seems to be what Wordpress did). So the URLs actually resolve a bit like this: * /assets/xyz.png -&gt; nginx -&gt; filesystem * /client/app.min.js -&gt; nginx -&gt; frontend server -&gt; filesystem * /api/foo -&gt; nginx -&gt; frontend server -&gt; backend server -&gt; database * /everything/else -&gt; nginx -&gt; frontend server -&gt; pre-rendering 
Removing the file does not remove the code that is in it. You need to either override the methods or use a proxy to replace the file.
My vote is for [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) - it is actively developed by Mozilla, based on Jinja (I come from a Django background myself, so it was just easy to transition to Node templating) and is pretty fast/easy to use.
It also makes sense for rational powers in with odd denominators in lowest terms, without needing to refer to complex numbers; because, in effect, *all* finite non-integers in JS or any other language implementing IEEE-754 or other binary floating-point arithmetic are rational numbers with even denominators, the discussion below is irrelevant, but still interesting. Anyway, my understanding is that many computer implementations of exponentiation rely on implementations of the natural exponential and natural logarithm (both of which have good power-series approximations) and then calculate `x^y==exp(y*ln(x))`; even though (-8)^(1/3) has a real-number value, -2, the approximation above would create a `NaN` in implementations without complex-number support, because `ln(-8)==NaN`, `(1/3)*NaN==NaN`, and then `exp(NaN)==NaN`. --- With complex-number support, take the principal value, so exp((1/3)*ln(-8))==exp((1/3)*(i*pi+3*ln(2)))==exp(i*pi/3+ln(2))==2*cis(pi/3)==2*(1/2+i*sqrt(3)/2)==1+i*sqrt(3) Unlike some operations with imaginary intermediate steps, this one doesn't result in a real number in the end; you might want special-case logic to pick the real value where it exists, but it's less efficient and increases the amount of discontinuity in the power function. Finally, as an exercise for the reader, the principal value of i^i is a positive number, as are *all* values of this expression.
They got that name from people who derided the concept, before they were found to be useful in mathematics. In a way it's like the "Big Bang" theory, which got its name from an astronomer who thought it was ridiculous and wanted to point that out.
I do the same thing as the author whenever I see this crap anywhere. Any form of client-side DRM or content protection that keeps me from consuming how I want just pisses me off enough to figure out how to bypass it. It's also insanely pointless because even if someone was trying to scrape their site to spam elsewhere, requesting the HTML directly using something like cURL wouldn't enforce any of the permissions javascript is creating anyway. 
I personally like Jade and use it because the syntax is very easy to use and there's not a bunch of weird syntax inside html to do loops and all that.
I tend to agree with @roman01la. The thing that is now called `tree-shaking` is kinda related to the js module system and it looks like a nice optimization.
Can't anyone create their own projects and host code on Github? It's not exactly a privilege. In my mind it shows initiative and actual interest in the field to do so. I know I certainly wasn't privileged when I was unemployed, and posted simple libs/modules on Github to better showcase to employers what I'm capable of. Especially since I didn't even have previous work from employers to show off.
Webpack follows the structure of commonjs ie var $ = require( 'jquery' ); This allows for doing pretty nice thing as it parses sass, less, css, babel, typescript etc. It just works, without need to have gulp, grunt or any other tool. Also you can use webpack with bower as well, I did it several times. The last thing is that you may use a module both in your backend and frontend code if you want (like validation, jsons with lang files).
It's not correct without the imaginary number because it's not reversible. If you take this result: r = Math.pow(a, b/c); You should be able to get the base *a* by doing the reverse calculation: a = Math.pow(r, c/b); But Math.pow never returns a negative number, which means *a* can't be negative. It might look ok as a 2d graph, but that's just one slice of the data which is 3d: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28-2%29+^+n+from+-2+to+10
It's adorable!
&gt; The amount of boilerplate logic and code required to get a simple hello world application up and running is going to scare a lot of developers. This was my first thought after looking over the Angular 2 documentation for Hello World [a bit](https://angular.io/). When a simple example of Hello World looks extremely verbose and complicated, that isn't a good sign. I've really enjoyed working with Angular 1.3/1.4 in personal projects, but I'm in the process of scoping out which framework/library to use for a new project I'm on and I just can't see Angular 2 being the winning choice. Seems like React has a much better setup at this point.
That guy is killing it! First [he hacks airplay using node](https://github.com/watson/airplay-server) and now this.
&gt; I know I certainly wasn't privileged when I was unemployed, and posted simple libs/modules on Github to better showcase to employers what I'm capable of. Especially since I didn't even have previous work from employers to show off. Did you have to provide full-time child care? There are excellent candidates who have other situations which you yourself might not have that preclude the candidate having an open source profile. It is excellent that you had the initiative and interest in the field to do so. I would expect that to show through in your technical interview. There are other ways to gain that knowledge and experience. As an interviewer, I'm trying to level the playing field across all candidates to the specific 45 minutes I have with you, so that I can evaluate candidates in a more objective way.
Nice keyboard!
I figure you might want something like [this](http://jsfiddle.net/Lg8ef6th/). Replace the data with your actual data or better, load it from a JSON file.
You can stop with `break` (also with `return`, but that can get a little messy). And here's how I'd find longest word: https://jsfiddle.net/bvdm3u6e/
I'm also a contributor and active user of Marko and would also highly recommend it. It's fast (compiles to readable and efficient JavaScript code). It can run in the browser or on the server. It uses an HTML syntax so it should be friendly to web designers and developers. You can easily create reusable tags/components. The Try Online tool is extremely useful: http://markojs.com/try-online/ Also, feel free to ask questions on gitter: https://gitter.im/marko-js/marko Just a couple of thoughts on other templating engines: - **ejs**: It's fast and simple but is not asynchronous and the syntax doesn't blend easily with the actual HTML. Also, no built-in support for custom components or reusable tags. - **React**: The template code exists inside the JSX file which means that designers will have to be more familiar with JavaScript. Server-side rendering does not perform well. - **Dust**: This is probably my least favorite of the "popular" template engines. It does not perform well because the runtime template is basically an interpreter instead of compiling to raw JavaScript. Even conditional logic and switch statements are interpreted (really ugly code if you dig into it). - **Jade**: People like it but you have to buy in to the alternate syntax. I personally prefer HTML but that is very subjective. There's a lot more people that know HTML than Jade (which is less subjective).
Ooooooohhhhhh okay, the reason I used "&gt;=11" was because I was trying to do anything equal to or greater than 11. Also, this script doesn't work, it simply disables the other hide functions on my website which is weird... 
Here is the code formatted so no one has to do what I just did ever again. (To satiate the curious.) function findLongestWord(str) { var count = 0; //counts a word var count2 = 0; //counts another word for (j = 0; j &lt; str.length; j++) { //for loop, loops once for each character, have to change to word for (i = 0; keepCounting == true; i++) { //keeps counting as long as there are characters if (str[i] !== " ") { //makes sure no spaces count++; //counts } else { //otherwise keepCounting = false; //stop counting } } for (h = 0; keepCounting2 == true; h++) { //keeps counting like before if (str[i + 1] !== " ") { //starts where count left off count++; //counts } else { keepCounting2 = false; //stops counting if there's a zero } } if (keepCounting == false &amp;&amp; keepCounting2 == false) { //when both are done counting if (count &lt; count2) { //keep the bigger one count = 0; //sets to zero to count again keepCounting = true; //sets true to count again } if (count &gt; count2) { //keep the bigger one count2 = 0; //sets to zero keepCounting2 = true; //counts again } if (count === count2) { //keep count2 count = 0; keepCounting = true; } } } } var keepCounting = true; var keepCounting2 = true; findLongestWord("hi there"); 
I want one! :)
For fun I rewrote your function for you. function findLongestWord(sentence) { var words = sentence.split(' '); var longestWord = words.reduce(function (maxWord, word) { return word.length &gt; maxWord.length ? word : maxWord; }); return longestWord; }
Oh for some reason Reddit just glitched a little, this one works as well but I meant that to be for Wince's reply.
Works! :) thank you, I will. 
suggest a price, i'll ask my wife :D
If this goes up on Etsy I will buy one.
But how can we tell what type of duck it is?
awesome, i will notify 
She should also knit little violins so you can have a js fiddle
that Z is confusing me
well, it was her first try :) will probably get better next time.
hah, no on your keyboard! edit: OHH. using some clues, im guessing you're European. at first i just noticed the Z, but then I saw the language some of your windows were in
QWERT...Z. Please explain, I want to get some sleep tonight.

Love the idea, but not a fan of using cloud-based software for development.
That hat daaawwwwwwwww 😍
Webpack and Browserify are browser bundlers. They take javascript modules and package them into bundles that are runnable in a browser. Bower and npm are package managers for installing dependencies. Two very different things.
I haven't done this tutorial before, but after glancing at it, shouldn't it be contactsListView = new ContactManager.ContactItemView 
Doing something bad for 9 years is no justification for continuing to do it.
Don't do this. function brittleAndSlowStriglyTypedDivide ( a, b ) { var q = a / b if ( /^\d+$/.test( a + '' + b )) q |= 0 // toInt32 return q }
Whenever you want truncating division, just truncate the result. Also note that Math.floor is only like truncation for positive numbers. &gt; 10 / 3 3.3333333333333335 &gt; 10 / 3 | 0 3 &gt; -10 / 3 | 0 -3 &gt; Math.floor(10 / 3) 3 &gt; Math.floor(-10 / 3) -4 Another thing to keep in mind is that "| 0" only works for numbers which fit into signed 32-bit integers. In ES6, you can use Math.trunc instead. It also works for larger numbers. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/trunc
I'm not sure. That's not what it is in the tutorial, and I get a different error on Codepen. I've moved on to another tutorial that works for me. Not sure what's going wrong with the gentle introduction. 
Many kinds of applications make use of scripting. Examples you might be familiar with are games and web browsers. By the way, just saying "xyz is bad" is entirely useless. You have to back it up with some reasons.
Currently i use grunt or gulp for what you mention. The only tool i'm not using is webpack, maybe because i'm not familiar with all the import thing. 
Very interesting information. I didn't know that.
So jspm is similar to npm + webpack?
Nice explanation. Thank you. What is a typical reason to use webpack with a bower package?
I would be interested when you will fill the bug
That's cute.
Maybe it's for his [type system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing)
There's no real reason this can't be done as part of the minification process. In fact I have an issue open for a feature that essentially does this for UglifyJS: https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/issues/805
And you're sure it's not just a quirk in implementation?
I like how JS letters are all screwed up like they were made in a rush. It describes the language well.
/u/jodraws, a real hero of the people.
 function findLongestWord(str){ return str.split(' ') .sort(function (a, b) { return b.length - a.length; })[0]; }
What is it?
If you want to follow the status and progression: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=4635 and according to comment #6: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4381 I am sure what is happening in the code and the committers aren't either, but it sounds like they have idea of where to look.
I've figured out how to easily resume in-progress after a crash, and it is not a core feature, so it seems unlikely that pulling on that thread further is worth the effort relative to the other things I have to study. Thanks though.
Im most sure it isn't. It gets to the point of calling a function with the same arguments and getting different outputs. Nothing in the specification talks about that function having an internal state (like a counter or a memory of previous calls) justifying this behavior. I bet all browsers and several JS implementations use code from each other.
It certainly sounds interesting. Please post back when you've done your reveal.
I will. :)
The thing is that I want to start it again when I want to.
WebStorm, Spotify, Chrome, and Outlook... Yes, pretty much the apps I have open at work too.
Hmm... so you want to be able to... start a for loop, have it stop at a predetermined point, then restart it again at that same point by clicking a button or something?..
You need to proofread your article.
As far as the 26 letters go, it's the same lazout but with Z and Y swapped. I can't even imagine the terror that must be to use the lazout zou're not used to.
I'm pretty excited about what may come of this (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3711). This won't be included in this course, but I'm watching this development closely.
So you figured it out? Cool!
did you try right clicking?
The execution context is where code is executed from. There is the global execution context, and there is function execution context. A JavaScript program always starts with the global execution context, and when a function is called, it enters that function's execution context. This context is added to the "call stack," which can be visualized as layers. So now you have two layers, the global execution context and one function context. If that function calls another function, the program enters that function's execution context and adds another level to the call stack. Let's say that this function doesn't have any other function calls. It finishes executing its code, and then returns to the function that called it. This means that the top of the call stack is popped off and you go down a layer in the call stack. When that function's code is finished executing, another layer is popped off the top of the call stack and the program returns to the previous layer of the call stack, which was the global execution context. If you stack too many layers on the call stack, you might have a "stack overflow."
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv_5Zv5c-Ts) explains Execution Context and lots of other base workings of the language. I even bought the full tutorial for $19; worth every nickel.
liked the diagrams. don't think I actually understood mixins on an abstract level prior to reading this.
This is awesome. A friend of mine has a little dinosaur figurine he calls Jake Wary
Why are you using jquery to blur? I'd use css for the blur effect and then css positioning to move elements over the parent element: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/zrBPmM

Hi /u/m1sta, this post was removed. Please see our [posting guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/wiki/index).
hmmm, this is interesting. My markup has the H1 in the .blur div. I though by jusing JQ to add css it wouldnt affect the child elements of the blur div. Can your example be responsive?
Hmm, is this not what JSX does under the hood? I guess JSX isn't exactly a template engine though. Benefit of doing it by createElement is that it's easier to sanitize untrusted inputs.
Responsive how? Does this work? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/zrBPmM
Could you show me how?
i have no idea whats going on in this thread but i would do something like: make a 100% width/height with a z-index of -1 in the parent but under the child. $('.parent').css({display:'block',position: 'relative').append( $('&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;').css( {filter: 'blur(5px)', "z-index":-1, background: "bg.jpg" , width:'100%',height:'100%',position:'absolute',top:0,left:0} )) this is also possible with vanilla js/css: https://jsfiddle.net/4qtbryve/
I wish to be on this list. I want one.
Thank you very much. I am going to use it!!!
I'll buy
Hon hon
It's very smooth and quiet, i like it. Also helps when you are trying to use all your 10 fingers while typing.
Haven't really noticed tbh. Don't do much uploading at work.
Yes, it seems like a bad idea, but the input is the result of a string parsing step which returns the tokens with string values.
Not sure how it works now, but I've had a package that was both in npm and bower, but unfortunately npm version didnt worked well in browsers. I am not sure but it was probably knockout-punches package.
Searching for *webdriver upload* didn't cross your mind? Also, stop talking like an idiot. It's not cute.
Good job you're not a mod :/
Hey did you know about console.info? Think I might start a blog around that.
It's funny how easily you forget about little gems like console.table(). I was reading through a list of Top 10 HTML5 Interview Questions today (http://www.webdevelopmenthelp.net/2013/04/html5-interview-questions.html#Q14) and was reminded of the detail and summary elements, and I honestly couldn't remember the last time I used those elements. Sometimes I wish there was a programming paperclip app that popped up with hints on possible alternatives. "Hey! I see your using console.log. What about trying console.table? (More info)" 
I don't agree with /u/robowork however I do think the blog post should have gone more in depth abd not just be a 30 second gif with a small blurb.
Just use the API. https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public
There's much more than just console.table, I wrote a [blog post](http://jilles.me/chrome-console-apis-youre-probably-not-using-yet/) about it a while ago! My personal favourite is console.dir :) 
is this only work on chrome ?
I prefer something in this style [link](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools)
[This much](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools) detail?
&gt; but I do need to look things up as I'm coding Rest assured that doesn't change with experience ;)
Yes but be sure you have the polarity right
Seriously though, you will use the REST API to retrieve json and, most likely, jQuery to parse and transform that json object into html.
Do you know if this works with any twitter account I request or does it have to be the one associated with the API.
1. Get the page contents using XMLHttpRequest to get the page contents as a string: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest 2. Parse the string using DOMParser: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMParser?redirectlocale=en-US&amp;redirectslug=DOM%2FDOMParser 3. Walk the DOM tree using the regular DOM methods
I really dislike the syntax. Especially for control structure. IMO Mustache/Handlebars has a more consistent and cleaner. 
I love the syntax. It keeps normal HTML and Templating stuff nicely separated. It also has a very short list of features with which you can do pretty much anything. 
Even with "evergreens" corporate environments often tend to stuck to "safe" mandated version of them and just kill access to update servers. Also I'm very curious how is Microsoft Edge gonna work out as an replacement for IE. That at least is promised to be evergreen. And yeah, unfortunately, "still need to support" is main criteria for using (or not) some feature.
This is a amazing, thanks for the post!
Edge is very good in terms of standards support (see: caniuse.com). I'm hopeful. I believe that once we get the corporate and government worlds off of Internet Explorer web development will be an evergreen breeze - locking a browser like Chrome to a specific version is ridiculous.
Also: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console
It's good in that yes, but it's still quite glitchy for everyday use. And I'm not sure that corporate security/stability mindset is gonna be fixed by getting off of IE. I put more faith that it could be achieved by much better automated UI test coverage, so IT can prove that mission critical web apps are not impacted by newer versions. 
Wow! Thanks guys. I'm newer to development in JS and have been disappointed with the in browser debug options. I like my intellij development IDE for Javascript, but sometimes it is nicer just to open to tools in browser to see what is going on. Glad I subscribed here.
you beat me to it :)
I keep getting this error. XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://twitter.com/jack. No 'Access- Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Is there a workaround to get the page contents? 
I use a server side proxy to bypass CORS. Here is one I wrote which you can use: https://github.com/prettydiff/prettydiff/blob/master/proxy.php

Is this new?! I have not seen this before. Can't wait to try it out. 
&gt; with npm 3 you no longer have nested depenencies That's wrong. That's just simply a false statement. npm 3 reduces nested dependencies, but still has them to deal with version conflicts. And that's not just a nitpick: it means npm does *not* work with ES2015 imports out of the box. Bower does. It also does not work with CSS imports, template partials, or any of the countless alternatives - Bower does. *npm makes npm (or something that emulates its module resolution logic) a runtime dependency, Bower does not.*
Awesome, thanks for pointing that out.
Wanted to build games as a kid. Turned into helper apps in early office jobs, and full time development when those contract opportunities became available.
Console.group can be helpful as well
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/lastIndex Regular expressions with the global flag set start scanning at `lastIndex`. I'm guessing this is what you've found. It's not as well-known as it should be, you find lots of code that introduces subtle bugs by forgetting to reset `lastIndex` to `0`. If it is something real, then what it is is a bug report, not something you can get a bounty for. Bounties are paid to counterbalance existing incentives to hurt Google et al. For example, if you can steal private information from Google then the price the black market will pay might motivate you to do so; Google's bounty program allows you to reap similar reward in a legal manner, preserving Google's security in the process. In this instance there's nothing to counterbalance.
Inheritance requires that you have one and only one superclass, while mixins can be applied to any number of superclasses. The single superclass restriction of inheritance is why you often hear the advice to not use inheritance for code reuse - it forces you into a specific class hierarchy. One motivating example for mixins in the web world is the event emitter interface used in the DOM. It has addEventListener(), removeEventListener() and dispatchEvent(). The main implementors of this interface are Nodes, but not all nodes do, so you don't want to implement these on Node, and some non-Node classes like XHR implement it as well. Defined as a mixin instead of a superclass, it's easy to add event emitting to just Elements, Documents, Shadow Roots, XHRs, etc.
... I'm sorry I kind of stated it like an asshole. I see what you posted a lot and it makes me fear that the community will abandon a more sound solution based mostly on a misconception. And I need more coffee.
Wow.
Read Bill Gate's short bio in a Forbes book when in 5th grade. Knew what I wanted to end up doing.
Went to school for Computer Engineering and dropped out after getting sick for a month during finals. I changed my major many times to all of my major interests. I settled on Fine Arts and got a degree in that mastering the use of charcoal in portraits. After graduating college I got a job in the retail world. Retail is a terrible place that sucks you in and keeps you there. After a few years I got fed up with the low pay and lack of respect and so I applied to IGN code foo (Web development training that you get paid to attend.) I put my all into completing their assignment and submitted. I wasn't accepted and this left me super confused as to what exactly I should do. I did not want to go back to college and I had recently heard about coding bootcamps so I applied to the Dev Bootcamp program in Chicago (I live in NY). After being accepted to DBC I saw a post on their website announcing the opening of a DBC school in NYC. I emailed the NYC branch and switched over to there. A few months later I graduated from DBC and began teaching the basics of Web Development to others to hone my skills. I love logic puzzles and problem solving which translates well into programming. Now I have a cushy JavaScript Developer position. **The End**. 
So if MotorCycle.js is much faster than Cycle.js, why not focus on it? Or are there differences I can't see from a quick look at the repo? Also anyone has paid for the egghead or the frontendmasters one and can comment?
Everything's fine with your answer. It is indeed very important to look at things from different perspectives. Please feel free to receive this coffee. c|_| 
Thanks, I did another pass and found a few things.
yeah, so I guess a good company styling policy could be to include the data type in variable names like **var int_aholic = 6; var bool_ready = false; var charAr_AlistCelebs = ['jackie chan', 'steven seagal'];** That way everyone would know what kind of data their working with. 
Ask yourself: Why would someone use you library over these other more established and well supported libraries? How many other libraries implement similar features? 
nah, I like it clean :)
Comprehensive test coverage and extensive documentation.
Yep, I love it. But this is better: let $ = s =&gt; [...document.querySelectorAll(s)]; 
A Resharper for the browser...hmmm
What about ? {test: /\.(ico|png|jpg|gif|svg|eot|ttf|woff|woff2)(\?.+)?$/, loader: 'url?limit=50000'} didn't look too deep into tthat but I am using it without any problem...
&gt; I'm currently building a library in ES6 called Crafter.js , and I would like to know from the javascript community what constitutes a good fully featured library in this day and age. This is a toolkit like jQuery, Backbone, and lodash. When I see the term *library* I am thinking a file or large function containing instructions dedicated to a specific task, most probably a task needed by one or more applications. That is not what this is.
I'm kind of going for an anti Framework type of library it's just a simple set of utilities , I'm trying to keep the entire library under 50kb minified, so it's more like components bound by a set of usefull utilities such as a streamlined process to define new elements and implement new things for their website without feeling like they are subscribing to a set methodology for writing programs as is with React / Angular and those. I try to leverage the standard library as far as possible JavaScript has come a long way since the start of the HTML5 era and a lot of the functionalities provided by popular frameworks have either had a standard means of doing it example Element.classList / document.querySelector and Several collection methods such as forEach on Arrays,Maps and others. I think fitting into a niche and dominating it is cool and I would like to component-ize things I've made separate stand alone versions of some parts of the library such as the router / type assertion and script/css loader. I just think there might still be room for a niffty little do-it-all kind of toolkit/library that anyone could use for the little things such as simplifying native js API's and filling in some gaps 
IT'S A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE
Goodluck!
It's confusing. for(let node of $('.s')) { console.log(node); } ... error, what the hell? Ah, there is only one .s let $s = $('.s') if($s instanceof Array) { for(let node of $('.s')) { console.log(node); } } 
You should just learn how to use webpack/browserify anyway. They go great with react, but really, being familiar with a build tool is borderline mandatory in the JS world. Anyway, the only things i'd say are must have's with learning react is flux (seriously, idek why you'd use react without a flux structure), and JSX (since literally everyone uses it, and its easier for people who dont know react/JS to read). That being said, learn this in steps. dont try to pick up react+JSX, compiled by browserify/gulp, built with redux on top of meteor. Focus on just getting react + JSX under your belt. the react/flux repo's have good examples on how to get a preprocessor running. Once you've done a todo list or personal project with react, i'd recommend integrating the flux architecture. Follow the flux repo's examples building your own store / actions / dispatchers (ie, not using redux). I'd recommend not jumping right into redux, because it really does hide a lot of interaction between the pieces from you, and its good to see how flux is actually working. Only then start working with redux. immutableJS is fun, and really useful if your data is dealing with non-database arrays of objects. But its pretty unnecessary if youre just building a form / lander page or reading directly from a DB.
You are right, but in rare and/or small-code cases it can be usefull and enough.
Hi /u/eindbaas, this post was removed. Please see our [posting guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/wiki/index) (specifically, _Posting: Showing off a Project_). This post is perfect for [Showoff Saturday](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/search?q=flair%3A%27Showoff+Saturday%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) though, look for the next one this weekend.
It's for when you think there aren't enough things which can go wrong and you want to scatter some more traps for yourself to make it more challenging. There are exactly zero cases where inconsistent return types are a good idea. Occasionally returning `null` is already pretty bad, but returning whatever goes even further than that.
Now that would be awesome. Maybe we need to send a suggestion into Jetbrains.
Check out the integration test for that command here: https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/blob/master/test/spec/desktop/chooseFile.js You just need to click submit to upload the file. Note that it probably won't work everywhere. The required file endpoint is not even documented in the Selenium project.
What immediately came to mind was setting a timeout on the `mouseenter` event, storing the timeout in a variable, and clearing the timeout on the `mouseleave` event, although this relies on nothing Prototype-specific. var fullPointerSupport = window.navigator.pointerEnabled, clear, enterEvent = fullPointerSupport ? 'pointerenter' : 'mouseenter', leaveEvent = fullPointerSupport ? 'pointerleave' : 'mouseleave'; function mouseEnterAction(e, thisArg) { hoverTarget.removeEventListener(leaveEvent, clear, false); // do the other things } function mouseEnter(e) { var target = fullPointerSupport ? this : this.PartialPointerEventsSupport, timer = setTimeout(mouseEnterAction.bind(target, e, this), 2); clear = clearTimeout.bind(null, timer); hoverTarget.addEventListener(leaveEvent, clear, false); } hoverTarget.addEventListener(enterEvent, mouseEnter, false); I haven't included all of the defensive coding that your example has, and maybe Prototype's `on` method does some of this manual wiring for you; also, you might want to wait a little more than 2ms, so raise that 2 in the `setTimeout` to suit your needs.
Mine is really bizarre. When I was little my dad brought us our first new PC which came with 8MB RAM with Win95. My parents wanted me to do something else besides play video games all day in the computer. That PC had one of those "Typing Tutors" sort of game. So, while to me it felt like a game, my parents thought I was actually practicing my typing skills. I had the highest score from my family(had big brother and sisters) in that "game" and then it hit me that I was actually good at this stuff so started researching more and more on programming on our dialup connection. Now that I think about it, I feel like it was such a stupid thing to get me started on programming but I guess in general no matter how cliche it sounds, people really do need to believe in themselves to achieve something. That was when I was 10 and haven't told anyone except you, reddit. Just you.
Your general concern is about phrasing content, or "inline elements"; you might need a whitelist of tags, because even something like `&lt;strong&gt;loud&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;emphatic&lt;/em&gt;` would be vulnerable to a whitespace-stripping algorithm that, say, looked only for inter-element whitespace.
That's crazy, because, I too, was heavily inspired by a "typing tutor" mavis beacon. I think all learning should be that easy.
Yikes, this sounds like advice from a novice. Not trying to be mean, but the content here does not reflect what I would expect from a modern, seasoned JavaScript developer. Just a word of caution for those reading
Use JSFiddle, JSBin, or CodePen.
I wouldn't say using javascript to make hover links red is in any way jQuery's fault, it's a tool, how to use it is up to you. 100kb of javascript isn't some massive amount, one jpeg is at least twice of that. Not sure if I want to take CSS advice from someone who uses `text-align: justify;`.
Are you serious? How about jquery-ui? Do you write those gadgets yourself?
OH MY GOD!!!!! this is so great!!
I leave console.log statements in my production code. Is this a faux pas?
Yes, usually. Most linters flag those by default. 
Those callbacks wouldn't be guaranteed to be called consistently, and if you process too long in one stack, it'll pile up calls. 
Saw David Blaine (yes the magician dude) on TV some 15 years ago. Got interested in magic and started researching tricks. I found out there was a lot of material on sleights of hand for cards, but it was scattered all over the place at the time. I wanted to make a website with all the sleights I knew, so I started learning HTML. The code was god awful. Everything was position: absolute. Then I wanted to make a cheesy intro animation (yeah I was young and stupid, I know), so I learned Flash. Then started toying w/ actionscript, js, php, java... after that I started toying w/ anything that seemed interesting (lisp, D, OpenGL, web frameworks, algorithms...)
It seems weird to me to write a program and leave out all logging. What's the new hotness to allow logging when needed, but not by default? My Google fu just comes up with a bunch of console.log examples. 
I am having a small issue moving my files from my root folder to a codepen, as soon as i do I will let all of you know. Thanks for all the help!
Try height and width in the css instead of inline in the html.
But in the end there will be DOM elements in both cases. I see no way to avoid them. What I've seen in the React sources is that they generate a DOM like tree in which objects have a tag name, an object to store the attributes and a list of children. (I don't remember right now how the innerHTML is implemented.) The thing that bugs me ist that they don't generate the DOM tree only.
That was a lot of help, thanks. I think I can see where I could possibly implement this elsewhere in the mouseEnterAction and mouseLeaveAction function I didn't show. The source is a complete mess - I have included a link below to what I started with initially: [Github - Magento rwd app.js](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-mirror/blob/magento-1.9/skin/frontend/rwd/default/js/app.js) (I only included the github in case you were curious, I've already customized the menu functionality in my project so my themes app.js is different so please don't waste any of your time actually solving it). I'm going to play with this week, I have about a month to solve this issue or even worry about it and you have given me enough to see what I need to do and learn my way through it. Thanks again.
Made a fiddle too: https://jsfiddle.net/49bqtLyk/ The black area is 100x100 square appearing rectangular caused by the combination of the width attribute and the CSS width.
I believe [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/) uses a DOM tree as its template.
OK, I used var canvas = document.getElementById("real"); var parent = document.getElementById("realGraph"); canvas.width = parent.offsetWidth; canvas.height = parent.offsetHeight; which made the canvas fit in the div, but now if I make my window smaller and not in the maximum size, the canvas gets all scruntched up and weird. What's going on there?
+1 for digging into FP and reactive programming but cycle.js seems as a step back to me. Especially with that DOM driver. JSX is much cleaner and works better in an environment where designers and developers work together (which is the most cases). The concept of cycle.js seems nice but it is kinda similar to flux or to be more specific to redux. I'll keep an eye on the project but I'll stick to flux+React for a while. P.S. I purchased a pro account at egghead and I could say that the lessons there are great.
I see your points. I didn't have the need of multiple inheritance recently and indeed your approach will help in that case a lot.
Because it's slow as shit. React keeps an internal representation of the Dom (strings, objects, whatever). React performs all of its mutating operations (updates, whatever) on its internal Dom, then it diffs the current actual Dom with its current internal representation, and performs the minimum updates to get them to match, all at once. That's the quickest way to do it, performancewise. So I've heard. 
Good point. Didn't think about it.
If you're interested in RxJS + FRP, but find Cycle a little confusing, you can try out a little library I've been working on. The barrier for entry is a little lower. https://github.com/garbles/yolk

The [es-pipeline-operator](https://github.com/mindeavor/es-pipeline-operator) proposal sort of adds a nice way to do this: class MyClass extends MyBaseClass |&gt; Mixin1 |&gt; Mixin2 { }
Most, but not all - newer additions to the language typically do not change the object. For example, Array.prototype.sort modifies the array in place and it is a pretty old method.
https://lodash.com/docs#debounce The debounce fn in underscore/lodash was written for this exact use case. 
For arrays, methods like pop, push, shift, unshift, splice, reverse, sort will modify the original array, most of the others like slice, map, filter will return a new one. For strings I don't believe there are any methods that will modify the original string.
Maybe putting `position: relative;` on the `&lt;div&gt;` will cause the width and height to be determined based on the div. .chart-wrapper { position: relative; } &lt;div class="chart-wrapper"&gt; &lt;canvas id= "Graph1" width = "100%" height = "100%" !important&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
React is how I always hoped it could be. *tear*
Do we know if this is true? It seems like this is something a compiler should be able to be smart about.
I might simply not understand, but this whole idea seems like a nightmare. The trend is away from state, away from globals. Making globals persist makes my skin crawl. "Hey, it works on my machine!" gets a lot scarier at that point. 
ES6 is done. That proposal is for ES7.
We have been running it in production for a few months, devs I've talked to absolutely love it. It's way easier to write tests when you've got pure functions. A lot less cognitive load. I've not used it yet but I'm looking forward to it after the shitshow that was standard flux or MartyJS. 
What was the answer? It was deleted. 
To do that, you want to **filter** your array. oldpostsarray.filter(function (n) { return n &gt;= 11; })
&gt; I said "best chance". Yes and it isn't true, because you have to adjust your animation by a factor determined by the time that really passed between calls and there is no difference between the two methods. &gt; No, there is nothing which will keep setInterval in sync with anything. You don't have to "keep in sync", you have to do what I wrote above. That's why req.An.F.'s callback function gets the millisecond timestamp parameter. in setInterval you can use a Date object to get to the milliseconds that have passed since the last call.
&gt; Yes and it isn't true, because you have to adjust your animation by a factor determined by the time that really passed between calls and there is no difference between the two methods. Huh? Yea, of course you have to use time-based animation instead of tick-based animation if your update rate is linked to the monitor's refresh rate. How is this supposed to invalidate my statement? &gt; You don't have to "keep in sync" If you want perfectly smooth animation, you need something better than simple throttling. You've heard of vsync before, right?
&gt; How is this supposed to invalidate my statement? It isn't? &gt; you need something better than simple throttling. Throttling? Where did I ever mention throttling? The discussion is becoming useless when one party starts inventing stuff. I'm out.
I think we're seeing a paradigm shift in the environment of designers and developers, mostly because of the advancements in browser technology and the following rise of web apps. Today, it's quite easy to do borders, rounded corners, shadows, gradients and so on, without ever touching Photoshop. In conjunction with the shift to flat design, the need for having a graphical designer do a lot of work will simply not be there. My point is that, at least for web apps, the focus will be on making advanced interaction design with HTML, CSS and JS, then apply graphical design to it afterwards. This is in stark contrast to a lot of the traditional workflows where a designer makes a template in Photoshop and implements it in HTML/CSS, then hands it over to the devs for JS and back end programming. I know that this might sound a bit arrogant, but I think this shift is happening because the very complex nature of the interaction in modern web apps is simply not possible if the JS devs don't have full control over the DOM. It's not really possible to build something like e.g. Trello from an HTML template made by a designer who has no idea how the JS will work. In the end, it makes sense to let the developers and not the designers have control of the DOM. And to most developers, it probably makes more sense to work with a declarative virtual DOM than the hassle of working with HTML directly.
&gt; It isn't? Yes, time-based animation doesn't mean that it isn't smooth. RAF is your best shot for achieving smooth animation and you will have to take the delta into account when you update your simulation. &gt; Throttling? Where did I ever mention throttling? setInterval is throttling aka frame capping. If the monitor runs at 60 hz and you cap at 16 ms, you'll drop some frames. That's just how it is. You have to be in sync if you want to have the chance to hit each and every frame.
Cycle and JSX are completely orthogonal. You can use JSX with Cycle.js if you want, as you can with lots of other view libraries.
I prefer immutability, so i always check if something changes values or returns a new something. I would love to have the entire stdlib only returning new somethings. Luckily theres immutablejs.
Please notify me as well
That's a nice alternative of React's propTypes in a non-React project :)
Can you tell that my js skills hark from the days of having to support IE6? :) That said, I'm guessing jquery basically just uses that when it's available, so I doubt it'll be much quicker. I'll be sure to try it later when I get home though, thanks.
MotorCycle is some kind of experimental branch of cycle. It's not just "a faster cyclejs" but a playground for experimenting with new and alternative ideas which eventually will flow back into cyclejs. There is some focus on keeping MotorCycle and CycleJS compatible api-wise to easy switching between them (not 100% of course as the vdom and rx libraries differ)
Sorry accidentally added a 6. Point still stands though.
Oh, one note I forgot to put in there was that ya dont need to array.join strings anymore.... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7299010/why-is-string-concatenation-faster-than-array-join ...only found that out about a year ago myself ;).
This is relevant to my interests.
I'm not sure what your real question is but ... overriding a native function on an element is pretty easy. Example HTMLElement.prototype.addEventListener = function(oldFunc) { return function() { console.log("adding event to:", this); oldFunc.apply(this, arguments); } }(HTMLElement.prototype.addEventListener); Doing that from a extension is very common.
Author here. I made shapely, because I wanted an expressive type checker to make it easy to work with tagged unions in a client/server setup. I did try and investigate almost all the solutions out there (ADT.js, atd-simple, etc.), but in the end I had to implement my own solution. Shapely is different form others in that: * It works with regular JS values (it does simple structural typing, without having to box values for them to type check) * It supports tagged unions * It's expressive without needing a macro system (although it looks much better if you use it with (coffee|live)script Note that shapely: * is not designed to be used as a form validator (like joi), * is not designed to work instead of a static type-checker (unless you really have a reason to not use flow/typescript), * and it's not designed to validate the input of a function (as in design-by-contract). Shapely is mainly good for client/server communication, and even then, it's good only in places where GraphQL-et-al's type systems can't be utilized.
Approximately, in general terms: Every component's API is actually a proxy to the module's definition, which is swapped using webpack's ability to hot replace modules using a live server that watches your code and pushes modules that you've just modified. Since the state of each component is isolated and dependent on an external source, the component is simply re-rendered in place using the state that is already on the client.
Ten chars smaller: `collection.reduce((o,r)=&gt;r.path.split('.').reduce((q,p,i,a)=&gt;~(i-a.length)?q[p]||(q[p]={}):(q[p]=null,o),o),{})`
 addEventListener("load", function() { var feelingTheSpirit = true; if (feelingTheSpirit) { alert("Happy Holidays, OP! :)"); } });
Nice answer :)
Oh lol I was trying to type all xD
Thanks this is good solid advice :D 
Oh god. It burns!
Yep, it's just a different point of view. I personally still see a value of writing HTML even though I'm a JavaScript developer.
Hi, I'm a huge fan of runtime type checking. I wrote a library with similar goals. Check out https://github.com/gcanti/tcomb if you'd love to share ideas / discussions 
What you really want are value semantics with optional immutability.
The examples here are really nice. http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/09/23/animated-background-headers/ I'm sure you could find some better introductions to canvas elsewhere, but these examples are easy to play around with and modify.
Thanks Paez. Performance is absolutely key, screw readability for something like this! :) This is the best I've come up with so far, no time to make a fiddle I'm afraid: http://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/114900/67893 Sadly although the performance is ok in Chrome and Opera it's useless in other browsers. (As are my original code and your suggestion). I think I might have to try a different method. Maybe creating an array of the longest strings for each column in php, sending that to the JS, then having the JS decide which columns to load via ajax. Rather than loading it all in and removing columns until it fits well.
Nice, I'll save this for future reference.
Everyone loves everyone here- until someone mentions semicolons ;) Happy holidays OP :)
Ignoring the syntax which will collide with decorators, this would likely be a nightmare to support in engines or even in the spec itself. Switching between two arbitrary language contexts anywhere in the program would add so much complexity that it is unlikely that anyone would ever be willing to support it.
Hi gcanti. I just read your blog posts. Great job with tcomb! I too think that runtime type checkers can be super useful, even when you're already using a static type checker. I'd like to understand how tcomb and shapely are different, and what use cases they're suitable for. So I'll explain one design choice that I made in shapely that imho makes it a good fit for client/server communication. Please let me know what you think, and how tcomb is different. shapely@0.1, used to box values inside containers (e.g `joe = new Person({age: 10})` instead of just `joe = {age: 10}`), but in 0.2, I decided to use regular JS values. My reasons for that change were: - I use Redux for state management, and my app's store is an immutable.js map. Since immutable.js doesn't understand boxed values, it just stores them as is. That would make part of the app's state, immutable.js-style values, and other parts, shapely values. As the app grew, that became confusing. - Validating an unboxed value is an O(N) operation, while validating a boxed value is an O(1) operation. That's good, but after using the boxed design for two months, I realized that I never needed that O(1) operation in any part of my code. I found that once values get validated and put inside the store, they never need to be validated again. Or, if a value is already in the store, you never have to validate it. So, I never used the performance improvement that came with boxed values. - There was one place where I *did* use the performance improvement of boxed values, and that was in pattern matching (though pattern matching is a big word for that simple feature I implemented). But I then realized that simple flow-style type refinements can do the job too. I mainly used pattern matching for detecting different variants of a union, but now that shapely has tagged unions, I just check for the tag and determine the right variant. That's fast too. - With the unboxed design, shapely can work with seamless-immutable values too. I can also easily retrofit it to work with immutable.js or mori values. - Unboxed values can be used as react props. So too can boxed values, but then you'll have two sets of react components that either support boxed or unboxed values. I realized that most of the components I made needed to support both. That led to an awkward codebase. I should say that I did finish my client's project with the boxed design. It was still super useful. But then as a bonus feature, I made shapely 0.2 and changed the entire app to use 0.2, just to make mine and future maintainers' jobs easier :) Looking forward to see what you think.
Why not just extend the current `"use strict";` to allow this, like `"use 2016"`? If `@use` was implemented tomorrow, browsers everywhere would start spewing errors. That's my first impression anyway.
Hmm... Fair. Just out of curiosity, why isn't that a problem with `"use strict";`? What if it was only per-file? I had it originally as per-function to support things like webpack, but with HTTP/2 that might not be needed. (And I see what you're saying about decorators... That would have to be changed if this ever got serious).
Use strict was much more limited in scope than what you are proposing, for the most part it was converting mistakes into syntax errors. Engines really wanted it afaik. For more details about the changes see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode
Hmm... Would it be unfeasible to offer this on a per-script basis?
Or classes. ;) Merry War on Christmas!
If you're using React then you might as well avoid any other frameworks because that's just overkill. Use Redux or Flux or something similar with it. Just a thought but if you're only using jQuery for AJAX then I feel like you might be better off dropping jQuery entirely in favor for a dedicated AJAX library with a smaller footprint. For instance you could even try Fetch https://github.com/github/fetch which is the proposed API for ES7 (I think?). If you need support for old IE you'll want to hang onto jQuery though (keep in mind everything older than IE11 is effectively being nixed January 16, though).
To each their own. ;) I prefer the much cleaner syntax, auto-scoped variables, the shortened function definitions, and the "everything is an expression"-ness. Going back to JS feels like stepping into the Stone Age once you are used to those features, especially when writing functional code. If you write any significant amount of functional-style code I can't recommend it enough. It's a joy to do stuff like Sum_evens_to_100 = _(1...100).filter((n) -&gt; n % 2 == 0).reduce((result, n) -&gt; result + n).value() Just picturing what that looks like in JS makes me cringe. Es6 has made that somewhat bearable with the shortened fn defs, but they botched it by making it too complex, eg you can only omit the return statement in certain cases. Dammit JS, of course I want to return a value from my function! That's the entire point! And they haven't even done anything to make statements into expressions. It's annoying as hell that I can't do this: lower_strings = for s in string_array s.toLowerCase() And end up with an array of strings. Or this: mixed_strings = for s in string_array if s.length % 2 == 0 s.toLowerCase() else s.toUpperCase() Which uppercases odd length strings and lowercases even length strings. Obviously these are trivial examples, but you can hopefully see how these features lead to incredibly clear, concise, functional, and expressive code. Beware, once you really understand how powerful this stuff is and how to use it, it's tough to go back. :) 
We start https://fastfred.de on meterjs. And currently flight is good
Nice! Here's one canvas demo also, since other are doing self promo also: https://nodegarden.js.org
Loops and map() aren't synonymous. Loops and forEach() are. However, in ES6, loops are perfectly fine. forEach primarily exists as a workaround for function scope and the inability to close over the loop counter. Neither is a problem in ES6. forEach() is all about side-effects. It's not very functional. By the way, that example kinda sucks. The part before the '@' in email addresses is case-sensitive.
Getting a tax number as an American is relatively easy. What I did was go on Upwork and I work on stuff that I find interesting. Follow your passion. ;)
Two things: 1. I don't really think Backbone is a buzzword that draws in talent in late 2015. 2. Why keep jQuery for AJAX? Plenty of other options out there now.
Build personal projects on your own and/or contribute to open source. Either of these things will give you material to show potential to employers to help convince them to take a gamble on hiring you.
I use angular at my job and its great for a huge project. Never used react this way so I can't chime in there. If you do go with angular, get really familiar with creating directives first. I made the mistake of using controllers for my logic and its a big mess in having to clean up as I go. Live and learn though. I'll plus one for angular but react has a lot of good reasons to use it. 
I just wish I could turn off ASI. It'd make it so much easier.
Even though Microsoft will stop supporting them in next month, it won't disappear from market in the single day... 
I watched MJPME (something like that, the Spotify guy)'s video on that. Obviously that doesn't make me an expert, but it seems like ASI works the same way as Lua's compiler (not sure if Lua uses something like ASI or not, though). I've actually run into problems in Lua which are roughly equivalent to ASI errors, though. Having learned a bit about Javascript, then not coded anything substatial and instead dived directly into Lua with my unpracticed JS knowledge, I guess I've got a bit of a different viewpoint than most JS devs, but I like ASI. I've never much liked semicolons, and Lua was a freeing experience for me. Probably the only time I'll ever use them in a language that doesn't require them is if a teams design standard requires it or it's a line where it's required, like (this is Lua code, but should apply to JS): local foo = bar ("baz"):find("buz") Which should have a semicolon after bar. That's fairly obvious to me, but that might be because Lua is an interesting language where local a,b = 1,2 print(a,b) local c,d = 3,4; (print or io.write)(a,b,c,d) is how you can code (in this case you need a semicolon after the 4, otherwise it will try to access the number's metatable's "__call" value).
Or framework X vs framework X+1.
Thanks!
Thanks! I won't be around do this, but I'll keep an eye out
I'll try this out, thanks
everything sounds good about that except the Meteor part.
In Mithril, bindings are done via m.prop (a getter/setter function), although it's not the only way to work w/ data (see http://lhorie.github.io/mithril-blog/asymmetrical-data-bindings.html or flux et al for alternative examples). Reactivity in Mithril is context-sensitive (i.e. based on the call stack) rather than data-sensitive (what ember and knockout do). If you're going with the observable pattern (i.e. data sensitive reactivity), put some thought into computed properties and optimizing them because the performance of the naive solution can get quite slow in moderate-to-high complexity pages. A project called cellx popped up on this subreddit a while back. That might be a good place to get some ideas.
Sweeet.
In Belgium it is harder. Heavy taxes and tons of administrative tasks make it a serious choice. But at least we have free healthcare :P 
I'm not American and I got an ITIN number years ago, it was easy and a complete waste of my time. As a freelancer you will have to check your local tax laws to see what's wisest for you. However you can start working on Upwork as a contractor without any of that stuff. 
I would love to get in on this. Twitter @pdxDev503 is better for me than email but if you need it I will provide it.my github account is CaBra503. I am an intermediate beginner. Meaning I have basics down of both web programming and object oriented programming. But by no means am I advanced I have only just yesterday completed my first paid job for web development.
Hey there I just added you to the gitter group. I can't wait to work with you!
I really like kefir, it is the fastest of the bunch I believe as the creator made it because baconjs was too slow for his tastes. Additionally it keeps a very clean and simple API with good docs. Kefir sidesteps the whole hot vs cold thing by only having one type of observable that only produces values that have happened since the `.on` was called. The only caveat being kefir has properties that can have an initial value which is emitted immediately upon subscribing. The kefir docs will give a better explanation though.
I'm using tcomb in production in a Reedux project; I'm not the author, but I think the main difference is that tcomb's data structures are immutable. This has a couple of consequences: First, because the data is immutable, tcomb can use constructors that return unboxed values; this means that tcomb works great with lodash, Ramda, seamless, etc. And you can of course use them as props to React components. The only thing you can't do is mutate the values. Second, because it's immutable, I can use a tcomb struct instead of an Immutable.js map for my Redux state. At least for my use cases, this works quite well.
Very good tutorial, thanks !
**Getting MEAN with Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node** by Simon Holmes is an excellent introduction to Node.js. **Node.js Design Patterns** by Mario Casciaro is awesome once you have a decent understanding of Node.js and want to really take your knowledge to another level. Right now I am reading [**Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja, Second Edition**](https://www.manning.com/books/secrets-of-the-javascript-ninja-second-edition) by John Resig et al. It is excellent for those who already know the basics of JavaScript but want to up their game. The second edition is also updated for ES6 (and even talks a bit about ES7).

One difference between React and Angular that I have seen discussed in many places if their level of opinionated-ness. Put simply: React is less opinionated and thus easier to implement into a team that has existing workflow processes. Good for: one-off javascript elements/widgets/plugins. Angular is more opinionated (than React) and therefor can provide developers with a somewhat-beaten path as far as app structure and workflow processes. Good for: Full-scale javascript app structure that spans across MVC principles. This is a very basic understanding; you can use either of them for one-off elements and full-scale app structuring. But either framework may be suited to do one of those things better than the other.
Watch/read Kyle Simpson's stuff. And just build stuff.
...why?
The least JS explicit problem ever though. :(
Business requirements and UX decisions. But I agree that we should have less and I think we will, hence the req to allow the steps to shorten :)
Does Angular count as a jQuery plugin? In all seriousness, you don't want to DIY a data-driven app with jQuery unless you really know what you're doing. Look into Backbone (conceptually a bit flawed IMO but sane and easy to pick up) or Angular (more robust but a pretty steep learning curve) or something similar. 
Options are good to have. (Also, the reasons written in the post: speed and concurrency)
Technically, yes, the local-part of the email is case sensitive, but it's on the host system to distinguish that. And I'm fairly certain that no big email host/provider respects case sensitivity on the local-part of the email address. So the example, seems to be accurate, and not to mention, just an example. 
A few things I'd look into if I was you: * Try detaching the table from the DOM (`$.detach`) before messing with it, then reattaching it when you're done. Modifying DOM elements while they're visible usually causes the browser to re-render which takes time. * Query for your top-level table element at the beginning and then afterwards use `$table.find(selector)` to speed up the selector queries a bit. This won't make a significant difference if the table is all that's on the page, but it'll help a bit if there's other content there. * This is going to sound a bit insane, but I'd try this (disclaimer: I haven't before): * Draw the table once, so you can get the individual column widths. Might be more performant if you do this "off-screen" where it won't actually be rendered. * Remove the table. * Use the column widths to compute which columns you want to keep. * (this is the insane part) Get the HTML content of the table and remove the columns you don't want from the HTML string itself. Judicious use of `String.split()` and `Array.join()` will probably help here. * Then just spit the whole thing back onto the page as HTML. The rationale is that browsers are *very* optimized for parsing and rendering HTML, while modifying the existing DOM requires the browser to shuffle around a bunch of internal data structures. It's probably faster than you think. Note that concatenating strings together is slowish (the whole string gets copied each time) which is why I suggest splitting and joining instead. This is probably a comparatively minor consideration though. This is all micro-optimization, but hey, you asked for it :)
That's what I meant by... &gt; passive aggressively push me into an overall architecture It's the criticism that I've heard of Angular.
Well.. at the end of the day all you need to make angular work is #javascript.js app = angular.module("myApp", []) and # index.html &lt;body ng-app="myApp"&gt;&lt;/body&gt; And from there you can make directives, which are, as far as I know, akin to the elements you make with React. The only way I'd say Angular would "aggressively push" anyone to do anything is if they went into it not knowing what it was. So keep doing your research :)

I am not exactly n00b. Advanced-ish. I can verify with 100% certainty that Meteor is godmode. I only got to use it briefly, but it was sexy. Just make sure you use the latest version, Iron Router is a must, and choosing a front end templating language is a huge decision. Angular's learning curve starts nice but gets steep, Blaze is easy mode but then you have to implement your own data-binding or use reactive vars, I know next to nothing about React, but I hear it's the cat's pajamas. Hell, mix em together and make a frankenproject.
I've just checked out the code, my colleagues were using a mix of jQuery,easyUI, jQuerymy &amp; Art.dialog. Any thoughts or comments? (like is it robust or suitable for the job or anything you want to comment on. Thanks :D)
Are you talking about blocking links within the web app or throughout the user's browsing experience?
This was probably the same reaction when they first announced nodejs. "JS in server" &gt;...why? 
Thanks for the reply Josh &gt; I don't really think Backbone is a buzzword that draws in talent in late 2015. I mean more of 'X Framework' developer rather than specifically Backbone. But your comment sort of points to what I'm talking about. If someone is applying based on our framework choice, it's been my experience that it's usually younger, less experienced developers who haven't seen the rise and fall of tools yet. (JSP anyone?) But of course, that's a bias I carry :) 2. Why keep jQuery for AJAX? Plenty of other options out there now. We also use if for a number of DOM manipulations, event handling, etc. Basically we have to keep it for legacy code until we can remove it. 
Thanks for the reply /u/ugwe43to874nf4- &gt; I wouldn't aim, at least at the start, to push out a refactor each day. Make cycles longer at the start because at the start is when you will need to make bigger changes the most. My experience over my career has taught me to make small changes that keep the system working. Even if the total work done is more, the time worked is less since there's less room to get off track/let code get stale. Code that's not in production becomes stale. We continuously integrate on the backend right now, and I'd like to keep that up. That said, a refactor a day is isn't a strict rule or even a guideline. I suppose I should have wrote I want to keep continuously integrating. &gt; "No rewrites, only refactors" sounds good on principle. But then again this will turn out to be the most limiting one of your requirements. I'm not saying you shouldn't aim for this, but be aware that this will be so, and that there may come a time when the correct option will be a rewrite of some parts. After all, you're starting from "jquery soup", you said it yourself, and you will want and need to do some architectural work. I appreciate the balance from your viewpoint. Above all, I aim to be practical. No rewrites, (mostly) refactors (edited ;) has served me very well on the backend over the last XX years. I have refactored lots of jquery in our app to smaller pieces right now without having to resort to rewrites, and see a good path forward from jquery soup to something more testable. We'll see though! &gt; Testing... We already do what you mentioned! We have a pretty good (but could definitely be better) set of functional tests. What I'm looking for specifically is unit testing/integration. Some things that tie presentation and logic together can be very hard to test. I'm happy to trust something like React to render a state without testing, but I'd like to be able to test that given an action and a App State, that the new App State created is expected. And likewise, that certain DOM events like clicking a button in a component generate expected Actions. Seems really similar to redux. I think you're write that RxJS/Bacon isn't feeling like a great fit at the moment, but that will depend if we use React or not. Thanks! 
Yeah, I probably would not have noticed were it not for this comment and its parent.
&gt; (Also, the reasons written in the post: speed and concurrency) 
easy for you to say! classes killed my family!
After investigation Cycle looks like a framework that has been thoughtfully engineered. Along with such innovations where are the try-to-be copycats where the barrier to entry is low and along with that come all the limitations as well. I'd recommend that anyone who seriously wants to learn RxJS and FRP and not just take the easiest avenue that comes along take a good look around before you leap. The more important question to ask is, where do you want to go and what do you want to do in the long run? Be the best of course! Cycle does not cloak and confuse RxJS and FRP in the imperative code style of yesterday. Instead it takes you forward into the future and teaches you how to think accurately about how to build apps in the new paradigm that RxJS and FRP bring. You can checkout the latest version of Cycle here: http://cycle.js.org
all you need to do is include both files in the footer of your pages. for example: &lt;script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-0mSbJDEHialfmuBBQP6A4Qrprq5OVfW37PRR3j5ELqxss1yVqOtnepnHVP9aJ7xS" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script src="/path/to/myJavascript.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

Hmm... for some reason it opens the the first page normally and then the other pages as popups. If you have a blocker on you probably won't see the popups. Might try "_top" instead of "_blank". Sorry, not sure...
React + Redux are highly recommended. 
This is SO antiwork it's almost insane :D
Thank You so much, exactly what i was looking for!!
Hey! Just started last month with Meteor and looks and feels great! My skill set is pretty limit right now, but i'll love to work with people using Meteor(and also learn together). My github is rodrigodata, and also you can find me on twitter @rodrigodata. 
I think this looks awesome!
I never realized how many freaking birds are in this song... 
You just have to replace the two short arrow functions with standard functions. By the way, there is no point in doing that, because mine was a joke, and because it is an innefficient implementation (for both human and computer brains). You are better served by using a standard nested loop that performs the same task in half the time.
The standard UI practice the others mentioned usually does the job: disable the button when the server request is fired, let the callback from the response re-enable it. Also, you might look at reactive coding. RxJS's main page has (or had) an example of receiving a stream of events from the UI, and "debouncing" them. 
Please don't pollute Rust with JavaScrap't.
You could search through all `href`'s and match by a `regex` and find DOM elements that have a match and handle it that way. What your asking for is probably not in a library, as it's extremely specific. Unfortunately - there is not a library for everything.
I'll do my best at explaining it. # Pressies const pressies = [ ":bird::pear::deciduous_tree:", ":turtle::bird:", ":fr::chicken:", ":phone::bird:", ":yellow_heart::ring:", ":bird::egg: ", ":bird::swimmer:", ":girl::cow:", ":dancer::notes:", ":tophat::running:", ":older_man::trumpet:", ":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye::metal:", ].map((s, i) =&gt; new Array(i+1).fill(s).join(" ") + "\n\n") Is like: let pressies = [ ... ]; for (let i = 0; i &lt; pressies.length; i++) { let result = new Array(i + 1); // Make an array of i + 1 length result = result.fill(pressies[i]); // Fill every element of array with the emojis result = result.join(' '); // Make the array into a string, with each element separated by a space result = result + '\n\n'; // Add 2 newlines to the string pressies[i] = arr; } # Ordinals const ordinals = [":zero:", ":one:", ":two:", ":three:", ":four:", ":five:", ":six:", ":seven:", ":eight:", ":nine:", ":keycap_ten:", ":one::one:", ":one::two:"].map(o =&gt; `${o}\n\n`) Is like: let ordinals = [ ... ]; for (let i = 0; i &lt; ordinals.length; i++) { ordinals[i] += '\n\n'; // Add 2 newlines } # Main bit Array.from(Array(13).keys()).slice(1) // aka range(1, 13) .map(dayNum =&gt; ordinals[dayNum] + pressies .slice(0, dayNum) .reverse() .join("")) .join("\n") Is like: let days = Array.from(Array(13).keys()).slice(1); // Make array of numbers 1 to 13 for (let i = 0; i &lt; days.length; i++) { let ordinal = ordinals[i]; let pressy = pressies.slice(0, i); // Get all the previous days and current day, reverse them and join pressy = pressy.reverse(); // Reverse (because it is sung in reverse order) days[i] = ordinal + pressy.join(''); } console.log(days.join('\n')); # Result So if you're not used to using `Array.map` and other functions like that, you might write something like this: let pressies = [ ... ]; for (let i = 0; i &lt; pressies.length; i++) { let result = new Array(i + 1); // Make an array of i + 1 length result = result.fill(pressies[i]); // Fill every element of array with the emojis result = result.join(' '); // Make the array into a string, with each element separated by a space result = result + '\n\n'; // Add 2 newlines to the string pressies[i] = arr; } let ordinals = [ ... ]; for (let i = 0; i &lt; ordinals.length; i++) { ordinals[i] += '\n\n'; // Add 2 newlines } let days = Array.from(Array(13).keys()).slice(1); // Make array of numbers 1 to 13 for (let i = 0; i &lt; days.length; i++) { let ordinal = ordinals[i]; let pressy = pressies.slice(0, i); // Get all the previous days and current day, reverse them and join pressy = pressy.reverse(); // Reverse (because it is sung in reverse order) days[i] = ordinal + pressy.join(''); } console.log(days.join('\n')); I'm not saying this is the correct way to do it, I'm just trying to help anyone who is wondering how it works.
By blocker, you mean adblock?
I just spent way too much time trying to figure out what the double colons meant in ES6, but that's just the damn emojis!! Thanks. 
What would a promise help here ? It would just execute then() when its done, since you are creating a promise for every button click, this wont solve it 
See above, and : What if its an input box for an auto-complete kind of thing You wouldnt want me disabling your controls all the time..
I would definitely give Redux or Flux a try again if you're for sure going to be using React. They just go hand in hand together, and then at that point you've basically got a full framework. As for jQuery, I think you'll be surprised how much you don't need it. It seems like a big deal to get rid of it if your existing code is chock full o' jQuery but as long as you're only worrying about modern browsers you can really do everything with native Javascript without too much difficulty. For instance Javascript has a forEach function supported in IE9 that works similarly to jQuery's, and you can run it on HTML elements like so `var els = document.getElementsByTagName('div');` `Array.prototype.forEach.call(els, function (el, i) {` ` // do stuff` `}` These methods will help a lot with the DOM manipulation side. - [document.createElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement) - [classList](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList) (supported in IE10) - [removeChild](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/removeChild) - [appendChild](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild) - [addEventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) Best of luck! 
Looking at the [`Array.prototype.fill` docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/fill), the first argument is the filler, the second is the start index (default `0`) and last is end index (default `this.length`)
ITT: A bunch of shitty ass "web devs" misunderstanding lower level language abstraction.
You could abort the first request (with XHR#abort for example) before sending the second one.
If it blocks popups, then yes.
The use-case is a CMS, which contains multiple pages with shared dependencies but also page-specific plugins.
On the twelfth day of Christmas, my true love gave to me: * Twelve stuck out tongues winking eye metal, * Eleven older man trumpets * Ten Tophats Running * Nine Dancer Notes * Eight Girl Cows * Seven Birds Swimming * Six Birds Eggs * FIVE YELL-OW HEART RINGS! * Four Phoning Birds * Three FrenchFlag Birds * Two Turtle Birds * And a Bird Pear Deciduous Tree!
"And a Bird Pear Deciduous Tree" actually scans better than the original.
I don't see how that changes anything. A CMS would likely benefit from being a single page app tbh. You would be able to preload the content right before the user needed it for a drastically improved experience. You also wouldn't need to worry about your issue because something like webpack can just package everything you need together in a single file and that is what gets cached and you are good to start building your app without worrying about these things that are blocking you from actually coding. Just make sure you spend time on picking a good routing solution as that will be very important. Ensuring forward and back buttons work is essential. 
Your understanding of fill() is correct, but I think you aren't understanding it's purpose in the program. Fill is used on temporary arrays inside the main pressie array (which at subsequently joined). The way it works is that, for instance on day five an array with five slots is filled with the golden ring emoji pair. This array is then joined and sits in the pressie array. So yeah, fill changes the entire array in this case but it isn't being used on the main array, rather to create the elements of the main array
You can use promises, and cancel the first one's promise as soon as the user clicked the button the second time. If you're using Bluebird, it ships with cancellable promises (it throws away the resolved value of the promise and the .then handlers don't get called) Also, for things like text boxes where you know user will not finish typing for a while and you don't want to waste resources starting a query you know is not the final one, you should use debouncing. This page has a nice library you can use + explains the difference between throttling and debouncing really well. http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/ If you're using lodash, it ships with it's own implementation of debounce/throttle as well.
A debounce function sounds like it will solve your problem. It lets the function be called multiple times, but only ever executes the actual function once per amount of time (or once per action). [There is more info on them here](https://davidwalsh.name/function-debounce)
# FFFIIIIVVVEEEE GOOLLDDDDEEENNNNNN RRINNGGGGSSSSSSS!
High five for this man, was looking for just this! :)
A debounce is a pre determined limit say a user stops clicking, in 400ms it executes the last action That action could now take 4 seconds to return, the user will click the button again in that time , causing another async operation , now you have 2 operations, 1 of which you dont want returning.
I just built this to help learn react. It's jeopardy with a list of 180,000 actual jeopardy questions and uses speech recognition for you answers. Unfortunately, it only works on Chrome and Android for the speech recognition. The repository is here if you'd like to check it out. https://github.com/dominathan/reactopardy Some things could use some help, e.g. 1) NLP - better way to score the speech to text input 2) Another library for speech to text that works on all browsers, not webkitSpeechRecognition Let me know what you think! Criticism and comments all welcome! Cheers, P.S. Many thanks to egghead for their instructional lessons.

It's acutally at least the seventh post across different subs from /u/datwheattho. He deleted most of them after I pointed it out [over here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3y3tk1/dive_into_meteor_with_me/).
here are some resources for node.js: https://github.com/vioan/nodejs-learning-resources

This sounds suspiciously like homework. Regardless, if you're going to ask for help, then please post what you've already tried (code). This subreddit isn't a place where you just request us to write code for you, however we will help you if you're having trouble with code you've written.
Hi /u/akmot, no surveys please. Thanks.
I tried this code on an online console : &gt;console.log("4.66098919150412e+15 2.79659351490247e+16 1.54744841157937e+17 7.93067310934426e+17 3.77873248151109e+18 1.67943665844937e+19 ".split(' ')[2]); doesn't seem to work, any hints on what's wrong?
Yeah but just because it's a single page app doesn't mean that you should have everything in a single file. 
Looks very promising and feature rich so far (have only tested it on my phone). The only culprit I could find so far was that pinch zooming felt irritatingly "non native". After a few seconds I noticed the reason: No matter where you pinch it will always zoom in on the center. It was nice if you could make it zoom in on the center of where you pinched instead like the native bahaviour. Great work.
So if you're not doing a single page app, then I don't know if there is a benefit to using requirejs?
&gt;If I had to write this, it'd be a for loop with additional inner loops. What a mess that would be! What's wrong with that? 6 months later when another developer looks at both your 'boring' code and this functional 'clever' code, which one do you think will make more sense to them? God forbid there's some subtle edge case that triggers some bug and your co-worker has to debug this 'clever' mess. 
You can throw "debugger" in your JS file and open the Chrome or Firefox inspector to use dev tools. It will stop when it hits that line, and you can step right through the code. You can also set breakpoints in the source code directly from dev tools. Use the Console if it didn't open by default.

Look at how you are handling the pos array on the create map function. 
Are you suggesting a list is not the correct method for an ordered pair, or are you saying the problem is otherwise?
Thank you! I have to be honest in saying I don't understand why that works the way it works, but I can accept it I suppose. What I did was akin to this: for(yada){ var pos = [x,y]; } and it works as intended. Does this mean I am instantiating a NEW pos var for each ordered pair, or simply just overwriting the past one?
could also use `Object.create()` var test = Object.create(new myType('nay','boo'))` test.type "nay"
Well, its more like reassigning what the 'pos' variable refers to. On mobile, kind of a pain to thumb a detailed explanation. But, glad you got going. 
So let's reformulate the question then: Would you use RequireJS only for single page apps and not for the described use-case with a CMS?
Alright, thanks man!
Cool thanks I never knew that. I guess that's why I've banged my head for so long trying to get breakpoints to actually work. Is there a way to enable debugging direct from the browser? I frequently am testing client's code and would have to intercept the response and add the "debugger" each time the page loads.
Great news and statistics. Been a fan of Vue since I heard 1.0 shipped. JavaScript isn't like a super intense passion of mine so it was nice to use something quite powerful with minimal effort needed to learn it. The docs are good, syntax is clean, and workflow is speedy with vueify. 
i like his post history
I remember picking this up the day of release and implementing it almost immediately into my everyday stack. So stoked to see it's popularity rise this much!
It's very challenging to attempt to form rules about the quality of submitted content -- they tend to be very subjective and exceedingly challenging to apply fairly and consistently. Instead, the rules are more aimed at things that we can objectively measure, while letting votes be the judge of quality. Although we may remove factually-incorrect posts, we try and avoid removals based on opinions (i.e. not following "best practices", etc.). For reference, I don't believe it's blogspam, which is when content is copied (plagiarism) onto someone else's blog. It can also be when someone creates a shallow (as in a few sentences) introduction to another post that they link to. Thanks for the report, I'll try to follow-up more about whether it's actually spam when I can get to a desktop.
Thanks folks, these are all great resources. I also found [Building Isomorphic JavaScript Apps](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920042846.do) which also features ES6/ES7 syntax.
Did you even read the article?
For every problem, the solution is an SPA. /s
No. I saw what I thought was standard clickbait "x-considered-harmful," posted my comment and left. As stated in my other comment, I misread.
&gt;This code isn't perfect If you're going to insult the man's code, you might as well say why. It is interesting that you're so defensive. I argued to the parent that they shouldn't worry about using the old boring iterative approach. You disagree? In this problem, a nested for loop could replace lines 20-26. I also think it would make it more readable but to each his own. &gt;Some of us have enough respect for the future maintainers of our code Good for you but that has nothing to do with anything. Here's an example, not putting braces around conditional blocks with one statement is frowned upon. Why? It isn't because you don't trust your peers... No, scratch that. People are people. They make stupid mistakes that cost time and money later - so why not do things that minimize those. That may mean you put braces around every conditional block, and you write code that is clean, maintainable and meant to be understood. 
The author of the library works at Meteor so I would hope so ;p
For the lazy, this is a front-end framework to make reactive components: http://vuejs.org/
There's a lot going on here so I'd have to spend some time digging through your code to really know what's going on. That being said, after digging around a little, my first guess is that it's something to do with the the controls for moving the camera ("ctrl + mouse") and zooming the camera ("ctrl + scroll") being similar and interacting with one another. I.e. one updates a value that is then used (in its modified form) by the second function. What's the specific issue you're encountering? I noticed the camera/scene seems to be getting stuck when you zoom in. For reference these are the pieces of code I was looking at: [code with zoom function defined](http://jdhcodelab.com/test/gravity/gameLib.js), [code where zoom function is called](http://jdhcodelab.com/test/gravity/gravity.js)
In Chrome, instead of navigating to the file via the source tab, you can press Cmd+O from the dev tools and start typing the file name to find it.
I recommend reading up on html input tags. On mobile so I don't have links but you can google it. Jquery is an easy way to get the value from an input field in a user friendly way. You can use something like $('.password-input-field').value() to get the value, where your input field is defined something like: &lt;input class="password-input-field"&gt; Topics to read about: css selectors, jquery, HTML forms &amp; input elements. Good luck!
Wrong mentality, IMO. A big part of Web dev is knowing what technology to use when, and *why*. You can't just sit on the sidelines and expect to understand where we are and how we got here. Look at learning a flavor of the month as a huge opportunity, not a liability. Learn **more** not less. It opens doors, it doesn't restrict you. Learn lessons and apply them later. Nothing forces you to use a technology you learned once but you will have learned a lesson from your time with it. 
Since 0ms is wrong, pull request makes no sense. You can see the modified perf at https://github.com/hackwaly/cellx/tree/perf-add-property. Test result shows my library is a bit slower than yours. Maybe caused by the usage of ES6 Set.
https://jsfiddle.net/ejumjcx1/ usually we do something like this (fiddle) you could also use `var pass = prompt('enter data')` or create a new input element on the fly `var txtfield = document.CreateElement('input'); txtfield.prop = blah blah; document.body.appendChild(txtfield)`
Did you read the thing your recommended? Because it's exceedingly bad, it has a 2 star review and it delves on implementation. And it does not even remotely cover all the things I mentioned 
Any code?
&gt;I'd like a sound theorical explanation describing XHR along with a broad description of use cases and most modern implementations (AJAX + PushState). I initially had some things written out about ajax, but then I re-read the description and saw that you're basically demanding a 'sound theoretical explanation' and a 'broad description' of use cases, I realized I don't feel like doing work for a stranger demanding what is frankly way too much of an ask on reddit on christmas day.
Not sure really, maybe on some low power devices where you want to pinch pennies for performance and don't need a full featured DB.
I've tried many of the edgy js frameworks out there and vue is hands down the easiest of them all. It goes straight to the point, it's fast, it pretty much works straight out of the box. 
Nice project too man! Except for this one we don't need a web app to create our share elements. 
lol
Isn't the purpose of opera mini to load things as fast as possible? Shouldn't it, then, not care about JavaScript or CSS resources?
In that case, great share! Hes got alias for everything, but in his api I couldnt find M, m yeah so I guess its the same moveTo. Really like it tho, very handy. 
&gt; found = true; this.db[i] = Object.assign({}, this.db[i], data); This is why projects shouldn't advertise line count; once it becomes a "feature", the project invariably begins adding multiple statements per line, sacrificing maintainability.

http://forum.vuejs.org/topic/849/differences-between-vue-and-ractive/ Evan You: &gt; Template syntax wise it's mostly subjective preference: Ractive uses mustache templates, Vue uses attribute bindings. &gt; Vue has a more intricate reactivity system - plain Objects made reactive, and can be externalized and managed elsewhere if necessary. &gt; Vue has more support libs/tooling (vue-router, vueify, vue-loader etc.) &gt; I actually know Rich who is the author of Ractive. AFAIK he's not that actively maintaining Ractive now (just look at the issue count) and is focusing on some other projects.
In programming there are some plain bad things, and then there are the hmmm-ful things. There are sadly not a lot of things that are clearly and always superior. 
Or you know, not using jQuery document.querySelector(".password-input-field").value
Thanks for sharing on Reddit :)
No hrefs?
So I am not sure why but your top 256 don't seem to be based on stars. What is it based on.
I'm guessing because you wanted to open multiple profiles or something. That should work now with the usual [shortcuts](https://github.com/lipis/github-stats/commit/665d58aa579ac65e14b0c6608566b8bf53960d79)..
Followers (as already mentioned) but you can sort the list by stars if you want to as well..
You are right on both points- I will investigate further and perhaps use a more rigorous benchmark. Thanks a lot!
Thanks. On mobile and didnt see that option. 
You are absolutely right! I thought about it when I decided to hide some columns on small screens, but I'm too lazy to show only the sorted column :D
Finding this a little misleading ... [defunkt](http://githubstats.lip.is/defunkt), number seven on the list, is a Ruby hacker from way back who now works for GitHub. GH runs on Ruby. And a quick scan shows more Ruby than JavaScript. Can I ask how is the primary language calculate?
At the moment I'm [showing](https://github.com/lipis/github-stats/blob/master/main/task.py#L259-L263) the most popular language based on the amount of stars.. which obviously might be misleading in some cases.. so just look at all these stats with a grain of salt and if you have a better idea on how to determine the language I'm all ears :) Even for [myself](http://githubstats.lip.is/lipis) it shows HTML but in my every day life I'm writing mostly in JavaScript and [Python](http://githubstats.lip.is/gae-init).
Why are there hashtags in this post title?
Thanks for the article. I am currently evaluating this model for the user management side of my app. I would appreciate hearing from the experienced folks here and whether there are any pitfalls to watch out, comments or opinions to share. There are some theoretical articles out there but not much about the implementation side.
I'm just a lazy bastard.. that wanted to have a row click :) Totally agree with.. so maybe I'll fix it at one point..
On a canvas, a path is a list of coordinates that represent a line or shape drawn from point A to B to C and so on. When you want to draw a line, you need to tell the canvas "I want to start a path" (`beginPath`), then `moveTo` where you want to start the line, `lineTo` each point after that until you are done. You can call `closePath` if you want to close the shape and draw a final line from the last point back to the beginning. If you wanted to draw another line, you could `beginPath`, `moveTo` and start drawing another line or shape. Then usually `stroke` which tells canvas you are done and to draw the stroke (the actual line or edge around a shape) or `fill` will fill in a closed shape with a color/pattern.

http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html oldie but goodie
Awesome ideas, I'll give it a go. Having a list of listners is a must i agree. I tried to stay away from map as much as possible because its quite a bit less performant than a native for loop. Thanks for the ideas!
Nice work. Looks a lot like lowdb: https://github.com/typicode/lowdb but even more minimal.
When you have one beginPath() and then another beginPath() after it, the first path is closed implicitly.
Try resetting the zoom level: ctrl-0
Could you punch me in the face real quick? (In my defense, I implemented a zoom feature in my game that uses ctrl+scroll)
That was my issue. I haven't felt more stupid in all my time programming
I don't know if I am glad it was that easy XD

Thanks!
In the top 1000 by stars... well, if you count org repos I've started. _[open sourcing intensifies]_
post a fiddle or make test fiddle and ask on irc someone will help :) you probably have to refactor your code a bit because the input field is async, so after they push enter or ok you have to do `var pass=document.querySelector('#myinput').value; step2(pass)`
*Javascript programmers more likely to click on stars*
can we get a comparison against JSS?
What are you going to benchmark, do you really think that "my library can route twice (10x, 100x) as much requests as express in 1 millisecond" is a most compelling point of a tool like yours? I mean, you are writing routing lib for websites, HTTP request would realistically take what, 10 milliseconds? Then you have stuff like database access, some other networking, maybe reading some files from disk. What fraction of a percent of your total request time is routing? I doubt it is a bottleneck. I'd rather spend time making sure stuff your lib does is obvious, reliable, easy to plug-in into existing infrastructure, and has good documentation and tests.
In my opinion, making sure data is consistent and correct from business-logic POV, is the task that is best thrown as deep down, as possible. Ideally, it would live inside your database and when trying to do something "illegal" with query, return meaningful error(-code)s. Say, you want an email field to be unique among users. You wouldn't write app-level code (so before registration it will select all emails from `users` and look whether new one is already in use by someone else), you would create unique index for that in your database. Why should "username is alphanumeric characters only" be any different? Feel free to throw some basic sanity checks into your app level code (models/controllers/wherever) and add some nice messages to your frontend (maybe simply use appropriate input types like `email` or `date`) on top of it, so you won't load your database with meaningless queries like `insert into users values ('', '', null, 'undefined')`.
Good rant.
WTF devs who can't handle graceful degradation?!
I've always wanted to live in the Cascades :D
JS is the language everyone can not avoid. If you make a webpage or something there's likely a degree of JS involved.

I don't think I'm the best at explaining things but here's a go at it: (var i =10; i &gt;= 0; i--) { console.log(i) }, this code is used to loop and print all of the elements that exist between the iterations of 10 and 0. Now if the element being inserted to the for loop is say, an array, of names, and we ONLY want to output the one's starting with K, this is a CONDITIONAL, and we need a way to figure out how to differentiate each individual element of the array before deciding to print them out. This is where the if() method comes in. "{ if (text[i] === "E")" if the element at array position[i] which is incremented by the for loop meets the criteria, do something with it (print it, or add it to another array or etc), otherwise, skip that element because it doesn't meet criteria.
I think the key to understanding this is to understand that a string is an array of characters. If you're not sure what an array is, I suggest you start there. You may have already used an array before, something that looked like this: var myArray = [ 5, 7, 9, 11 ]; To reference elements in this array you use their index which starts at 0. So myArray[0] is the value 5, myArray[3] is the value 11. myArray.length is the length of the array, in this case 4 since there are 4 elements in it. Your example assigns a string to the variable "text", and since a string is an array of characters you can reference a character in the array using it's index (remember to start with 0). From your example: text[0] is the letter 'B'. text[1] is the letter 'l'. text[30] is the letter 'E', the first occurrence of your name. Your loop iterates over the string for it's entire length, 113 characters. The if statement compares it's current index to the letter 'E'. If it is equal to 'E' the next loop starts at the current index (i) and uses the length of the string myName ('Eric' is length 4) and adds it to the hits array. The push-method of the array just adds a value on to the end of the array. Hope that helps a bit, good luck.
[Check out this JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/2otjqhLa/1/). I took your code and added comments that will hopefully help you to understand what exactly is going on.
&gt;At first I was handling the validation within this controller function, but decided it would be better tied to the model than the route for future proofing when inevitable changes need to be made. I think this is backwards. You're coupling your model code to your request handling code. It will make changing things very difficult because the user model requires express-level request objects to function. Ideally, anything below your controller level will have no knowledge of `request` or `response` or express. Your controller should take express communication (eg `request`, `response`, `error` objects), parse it, do something with it, and pass simple messages down to your models. This helps you isolate the inputs and outputs of your system which makes reasoning about each layer independently of others much easier, and it makes testing the whole thing way easier. Your models should ideally only deal with primitives and domain level objects as input and outputs. Your controller should pass some information to your model and your model should tell your controller whether it's valid or not. After the model tells the controller the state of the data, the controller decides what to do with it. If it's valid, it submits the form and tells the user. If it's invalid, it gives the user a helpful message with instructions on how to make it valid. Here's how I'd change it (ignore specifics, e.g. assume `validationErrors()` does what we expect: UserSchema.statics.validateRequest = (user) =&gt; { user.assert('alias', 'Alias is required.').notEmpty(); user.assert('alias', 'Alias can only contain letters and numbers.').isAlphanumeric(); user.assert('email', 'A valid email is required.').notEmpty().isEmail(); user.assert('password', 'Password must be at least 8 characters long.').len(8, 100); user.assert('passwordConfirm', 'Passwords do not match.').equals(user.passwordConfirmation); return user.validationErrors(); }; ... router.post('/', (req, res) =&gt; { // check for existence of variables needed here. if they don't exist, send an error without involving the model // translate express-y request stuff into a simple domain-level object let user = { alias: req.body.user_alias, email: req.body.email, password: req.body.password, passwordConfirmation: req.body.second_password }; // let the user model validate a simpler object without references to requests or responses let validationErrors = User.validateRequest(user); // once the model has told us the state of the data, do something with it - send error if bad, redirect if good if (validationErrors) { res.send('super awesome error message'); return; } res.redirect('/'); }); The key thing here is separation of concerns. Controller-level code exists to make sense of the information express sends around, and to translate it into data the domain level code uses. It does this by handling errors from express , and by formatting responses from express into code that is easier to understand. Model level code exists to enact business rules and shouldn't be aware of frameworks or requests or printing user output. It should communicate with simple inputs and outputs (e.g. pass in an object, get an array of validation errors, pass in a value, get a boolean response on the validity of that value). This lets you separate out your logic and reuse your model code. It also makes changing code easier because it can be tested in isolation.
You read what you want to read. I argued none of what you wrote here.
A thousandth of a millisecond per request. This is a tiny fraction of what a single HTTP connection takes to make. This will **almost never** make a noticeable difference in performance unless you specifically go out of your way to make terribly slow regex patterns (which for make matching you see in routes, would never occur)
We actually know it's a micro-optimization because we've all built tons of servers and you never hear about anyone talking about routing causing their application to be slow. You know what makes application slow? External databases, heavy computations, and database connections. Because your particularly dense, here's a quick performance comparison check: http://jsperf.com/regexp-indexof-perf/24 Were in the **millions** regardless of how we do it. 17 **million** matches per **second** as an upper bound. That means we can do **17 thousand regex matches in a millisecond**. Even if it's a **thousand times slower than this perf test it's still a non-issue**. Please tell me what server your running that handles in the millions of requests per second that isn't being ran either on a cluster of servers or is serving chached results from a CDN. If your serving enough requests that this is your issue, that means your server **definitely** isn't connected to a database or making any external API calls, and you should simply be serving cached results because if regex matching is your bottle neck, you literally couldn't be doing anything else but returing `200 ok`. Please - respond and tell me how i'm falsely stating that this is a micro-optimization that means literally nothing other than complicating a code base. I can't wait to hear the great counter example. 
I know it's not really the point of the exercise, but this becomes a very easy problem if you use a regex: var hits = text.match(/Eric/g); console.log(hits ? hits.length : 'Name not found.');
It's important to recognise that Javascript as a language is not bound to a browser. Yes, if you have front-end javascript on a website then that will be visible to the public. And of course, 'big apps' are written in javascript if they are in a browser. You can go to Gmail and look at all their front-end javascript all you want. Anything that is required to be private would always have to run in the back-end, but that doesn't mean it isn't in javascript. Back-end developer is a broad term in regards to what technologies one could use, but there is a lot of growth in running JavaScript in the server (and everywhere else for that matter). A back-end developer (who works in php/c++/ruby/whatever) certainly doesn't need to know JS, but there's a lot more jobs out there if you have a good understanding of the full stack.
I read what you wrote. If you wanted to be interpreted differently, you should've used words which reflected the thoughts you were trying to convey (which are still apparently unclear, but fortunately for both of us, I now have no interest in hearing what you have to say).
What do you mean by statics sharing space? Do you mean something like concatenating keys to branches which have no capturing in between, so {"a": { "b" : T }} Compresses to {"a/b": T}
This is how I would do it. String.match returns the index it was found at (or -1, if no match). Thus if 'Eric' is the first thing in the string, it returns 0. If the string is 'Hi Eric', it returns 3 (starts at [3] in the string when split by character). 
If you just started learning JS a few days back, you have a lot more to learn. EloquentJavascript.com is a great resource for *learning* Javascript. John Risig's ejohn.org is also a neat place to pick up a few advanced concepts. The Moz docs are fantastic for learning things *in* Javascript, but I don't think I would recommend it for learning *about* js.
If I understand your problem correctly, you should just be able to: var keys = Object.keys(localStorage); keys.forEach(function(key){ console.log(key); }); 
use tape, way better than mocah
Why? The documentation is rather lacking and there is no information about using tape with other assertion toolkits like unexpected.js.
i dont think findwhere does what you need and that is deepEqual().. this is what i used, maybe its not what your looking for http://jsfiddle.net/ayb1ajy3/
Because to teach a beginning what you just did you also need to teach: 1. What split() does on a String 2. What a reduce() is, and what it returns 3. What a fat arrow is Also, you should be using a filter(), not a reduce.
ES6 coverage is supported by iSparta https://github.com/douglasduteil/isparta Theres an example in the readme for running it over mocha tests.
Try it. Replace every i with something else. Then you'll know.
I would recommend never to make perf arguments unless you have comprehensive tests to back it up otherwise assholes like me will come out the wood works and question it
1. Minification munges all local identifiers as a side-effect. Reddit's JS looks like this, for example: https://www.redditstatic.com/reddit-init.en-us.js 2. Most of the big "JS" apps aren't written in plain JS. E.g. most of Google's stuff is [CC-annotated](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler) JS or GWT (Java). Some of the new stuff is written in Dart or TypeScript. Plain JS (ES3/5 in particular) doesn't scale very well. Writing somewhat larger applications with 2+ developers is needlessly difficult. I recommend to download VS Code and give TypeScript a try. You'll probably like it a lot better. Plus, the improved tooling makes it more accessible to beginners. 3. If you aren't using it on the server-side, you won't need to know any of it, but knowing some might come in handy some day.
Yup, meant to type filter instead of reduce. I understand that the array methods aren't transparent in their implementation, but given that a huge percentage of iterations over arrays could very easily be implemented with `map` `filter` `reduce`, I strongly feel that these methods should be heavily foregrounded in the teaching process. The number of otherwise capable and competent JS devs who don't understand how to use these essential array methods continues to astound me--semantic clarity is hugely important to maintainable code. My eyes bleed when I read a for loop full of mutating i, j, k's etc.
I've considered this, but it seems like you have to weigh it against loading bootstrap from a CDN, which could prevent the need to downloading at all.
As others have mentioned, offline versions of MDN are perfectly okay! [Devdocs.io](http://devdocs.io/javascript/) makes a web app that can be used offline and is searchable. It can also give you offline versions of a lot of libraries and frameworks you might use.
Yes I can be anything that's a legal variable name. It's a local variable created to be used inside the loop. Traditionally it's i for iterator (and j, k etc following for inner loops)
Yeah, that's how indexOf works. String.match just happened to be fresh in my mind when I posted that.
Less boilerplate, no test harness. Can be webpacked, browserified, loaded anywhere. No magic. Works with any assertion lib. Produces tap output supported by dozens of formatters.
After seeing this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/3ya7kc/started_learning_programming_at_codeacademy/ and thinking about some of the problem areas people have with JS, I thought I would whip up a couple articles to explain the portions that I had trouble with, back when I was learning it. Very raw, needs tons of work etc. but I would definitely appreciate constructive feedback.
not sure how much more docs do you need? https://github.com/substack/tape/blob/master/readme.markdown seems to cover the whole (small) api... 
&gt;you never hear about anyone talking about routing causing their application to be slow [An issue with routing in Express was a major latency problem for Netflix in 2014](http://techblog.netflix.com/2014/11/nodejs-in-flames.html).
Dat one page bootstrap layout. This question seems awfully silly. Knowing your tools also means knowing when and what to use. I won't use a jackhammer to nail a bed frame together
Yeah, it would be interesting to see stars including repos contributed to, split by contribution amount. Or something. It's all vanity anyway :v
It's definitely a silly question, and I feel stupid for asking it. But other than using wordpress, I've just never known how to do that.
You must be a real pleasure to work with (generously assuming you're able to hold down a job, I mean). Instead of parading yourself around as an infallible communicator and insisting everyone who doesn't understand your meaning is an idiot, why don't you explain yourself? I can't be the only one who recognized your tone as distinctly pejorative.
I assume that the OP is talking about client-side because in the README of the library we read "A tiny tree based url-matcher for JS in the browser". I may be wrong though :)
Last week was busy for me. I open sourced [BorrowBot](https://github.com/snollygolly/borrow-bot), created a [Koa Starter Kit](https://github.com/snollygolly/koa-starter), and wrote a [ShipIt Tutorial](http://evilmousestudios.com/casting-off-with-shipit/). Contributions or feedback to any of those is more than welcome.
You tell us :p Did you try it and see if it worked?
What makes it better than mocha?
If it's truly static, just write html with the content in it and a link to a stylesheet
I took that course to get me started with js. There is a discussion board with solutions on the course for 99% of the problems. There is nothing wrong with taking a look at other peoples solutions to a problem for the purposes of learning, but it is alwayd best to try to figure it out yourself if you want to push your own abilities. For example: i did project Euler through problem 20. I found some of them to be very difficult. A few of them took a day or two and a few of my solutions were terrible. I would go back and redo them more efficiently. And then look at other solutions that were just plain brilliant. You can make a 20 minute execution instead take 3 seconds, with less memory and 100 less lines of code. And my ego has no problem admitting that i may have never thought of that or at least taken an realistic amount of time to come to a similar solution. Coding is logical technical writing and the best writers are avid readers.
I may be misunderstanding the question, but for simple websites with mostly static content, you can use a static site generator. This removes the pain of managing all of your HTML files independently by keeping their contents separate from the template, and makes blogging fairly simple. There isn't any real routing, since every route is just mapped to a file built by the generator. [Here's a list of some of the top static site generators.](https://www.staticgen.com/) I deploy my personal website via [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), which uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). If you already know Angular or React, then the templating systems for these generators will be familiar. The speed benefit of using a static site is enormous. You can certainly also build a one-page dynamic app with Angular or React, and serve it as if it were static. This really has the same effect for the end user, but you can achieve much more interactive pages as well as more advanced routing.
Yea sorry about the naming :p From what I understand, the variable named data is the response from the Websocket from my Tornado server. It's data property is the message that I intended to send through the socket, and it has a bunch of other properties that just describe the message transmission. It's really long but its a MessageEvent with a data property. 
Try JSON.parse(data) JSON.parse(data["data"]) 
Alright fuck me, I've done that like 40 times in various ways but this worked, thank you.
harpjs http://harpjs.com/
Thanks!
When using Promises I recommend `longStackTraces` of the popular Promise library [Bluebird](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api/promise.longstacktraces.html). On the server I use [pretty-error](https://github.com/AriaMinaei/pretty-error) for formatting console output. 
Thanks! Will be waiting for part 2 :)
First, congrats on the new job! Build something with angular. If you know what you'll be building at your new job try to emulate it or build something similar to it. Also to note: just because they're using Angular doesn't mean that they're using it the same way everyone else is. In fact I would hazard a guess they're not. I once worked on a project with a very large telecommunications company that was "using angular", except they did everything backwards. So make sure you keep an open mind before starting your new job, try not to use "this is not how I'm used to things" as an excuse.
Good catch, thanks!
Yea, I've never seen a Markdown dialect which lets you specify the language of code spans. You usually only can do it with fenced code blocks: http://spec.commonmark.org/0.22/#example-99
Check out John Papa's style guide for Angular. It's an incredible resource on everything from code organization to general best practices.
Angular in 60-ish mins, watchandcode.com and angularjs recipes. Look no further. 
Github does it: https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#syntax-highlighting The website engine is supposed to use Github flavored markdown as well.. I suppose not fully.
Edit: I stand corrected. Am going to fix this.
You can't assume users have it already. The only testable scenario that you *know* your users will have, is no-cache. So assume everyone has that. Otherwise, you are pinning your sites performance on hopes and dreams that may not be a reality.
This is not directly related, but here's another list of awesome resources for JavaScript: https://github.com/sorrycc/awesome-javascript
jekyll. I use a jekyll static site on github pages to host developer documentation for an API I maintain and develop for work. its a good solution. I've also used jekyll to generate brochure websites that I host on AWS cloudfront.
You can configure the minifier to not munge the variables. With gzip enabled there's little difference.
Only if there's a notabele geolocation advantage. Otherwise it's an extra dns-lookup which are costly. Furthermore, it's not just downloading assets, it's parsing them as well with every pageload.
I'd definitely recommend getting familiar with directives early. I found them to be the most complicated part of Angular and the most difficult to learn.
This, and CDN's (in this case) also create a 3rd party SPOF. If they go down and you aren't checking to verify the resources make it and injecting local ones if they don't, then if your CDN goes down, so does a part of your site. &gt; I'm also curious about how SPDY and HTTP/2 factor into this: I understand concatenating will no longer be necessary, but will the http multiplexing also be an argument for avoiding additional http connections (e.g. to a CDN)? Absolutely. Multiplexing along with the way connections are handled, the more data transferred the faster things get. You are *way* better off if using HTTP/2 (you should be ASAP) and serving everything directly. Domain sharding is a thing of the past, one domain, one connection, multiplex to hell and back.
&gt; We actually know it's a micro-optimization because we've all built tons of servers and you never hear about anyone talking about routing causing their application to be slow. No, hearsay does not constitue proof. Tests - real ones, not whatever you linked - constitute proof. The problem with hearsay is in the other reply to you - you clearly haven't heard of it all. &gt; You know what makes application slow? External databases, heavy computations, and database connections. lol. If only I could just check three things and be done. &gt; Because your particularly dense, here's a quick performance comparison check At this point I have to wonder if you're just screwing with me. Did you really just link a test of a regex looking for a single static word, and claim it's comparable to running a regex that matches an entire URL path, storing parameters along the way, for every possible path in a website? What it the world? ... but it seems you do believe that's comparable, because you switched to bold. So, just to speak your language: **if you want to test something, you need to test that thing, not test some random bullshit then pretend the numbers apply to everything**. This is intuitive for some people. If you want to really test this, not just google "regex jsperf", I'd like to see the results. But I'm not holding my breath, I don't think you've written a decent performance test in your life. Oh, and you're wrong about it complicating the code base as well. It's fucking trivial (to the rest of us) and it's already implemented. The vastly more complicated approach is to replace the core data structure, rewrite every algorithm, and change the entire API - ie, trash it and make another.
trial and error it is! var oranges = function (orangeCount) { var orangeCount = prompt("what did you pay for the 5 oranges? We shall determine the price difference"); if (orangeCount &gt; 5) { orangeCount = 0; } else { orangeCount = 5000; } var value = orangeCount / 5; console.log(orangeCount); } oranges(); ahahaha, believe or not, it's 1:37 am and i'm here trying fiddling with "orange prices". Nah, this is something i created out of the top of my head without tutorial, while it meanwhile has nothing to do with orange prices, i think this shit is fun as hell. I should hurry up to bed so I can decide what I want to count tomorrow morning. I took a few days off at work. I shall definitley take on loop tomorrow once I wake up. Now off to bed I am before my gf noticed i'm missing. Good night y'all! thanks for the help
who the hell would downvote this? Its the only correct answer!
My favorites (more on programming in general, but something i apply everyday with JS development): - Rich Hickey: [Simple Made Easy](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy) - Rich Hickey: [Simplicity Matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0) - Tim Ewald: [Clojure: Programming with Hand Tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShEez0JkOFw) - David Nolen: [Immutability: Putting The Dream Machine To Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiFwRtCnxv4) Some more JS related which i also like a lot: - Christopher Chedeau: [CSS in your JS](https://vimeo.com/116209150) - Philip Roberts: [What the heck is the event loop anyway?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ) - Douglas Crockford: [JavaScript - Act III: Function the Ultimate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ya4UHuXNygM)
Yeah, I'm actually kind of confused why I got so downvoted. Oh well ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Slightly misleading title, but overall I agree. I do think Yeoman has helped and I keep around my own boilerplate version that I only had to make once. It's painful the first time, especially if you're new to the tools, but really it's not so bad after. I copy and paste a directory and drop it into my text editor whenever I want to start a new something. 
Use Ember then. It comes with batteries.
Thank you very much. :) . i just finished downloading the doc :)
I would start reading Eloquent Javascript as from next month , i have it as a pdf file
The major reason for JavaScript, aside from the fact that it is amazing, is User Experience (UX). Server-side languages force you to reload the page to see any changes. Each request is for the entire page rather than only the things that changed; inefficient. A JS application can make small requests for only the parts that have changed thanks to Asynchronous calls. Recently, UX is the new marketing and customer retention is success. Users are impatient and want to see what they need very quickly. Single page applications and bi-directional communication one good way to accomplish this. A back-end developer should at least understand the concepts of this to make life easier for front-end developers. If for no other reason, web developers are increasingly being asked to be full-stack - front-end and back-end. Lastly, JavaScript is now on the server in the form of Node.js/io.js. It is becoming a very popular and very in demand skill to have. Lots of wisdom in the comments on this page. I leave you with this: If you are worried about security in a JS app, look into building REST APIs with JSON web tokens for authorization.
8gb not bad though. i would download it in the night :) thanks
velocity is for windows, and zeal for linux, dash for mac. Thanks bro
If you don't mind paying a little, teamtreehouse is what I used to get the basics down. They also have a very extensive library of Javascript courses. Otherwise, youtube as the others below have recommended, and then start a little project and remember this: the angular docs are your best friend. Nothing beats experience. Congrats on the new job.
As a side note, if you want to get on pluralsight, Microsoft is offering six months for free. Here's the link https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-dev-essentials-vs.aspx
The Ember CLI is written in a framework agnostic way. Angular 2 actually uses Ember CLI. So get on to it! https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli
That's nice!
Looks just like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
That looks really cool, I might use something like that. Chrome is ok for snippets (or Webstorm if I need node modules), but being able to do it across multiple runtimes at once would be handy. I assume it's written in JS?
I'd have to say it comes down to binding and scopes. Isolate scopes are difficult to work with as anything that's not data-bound correctly is implicitly shadowed on the local isolate scope instead of being bound to a correct item from another scope. I came across this issue quite frequently when trying to get the use case of the directive having its own scope plus having bindings from any other scope working. The binding issue is down to using arbitrary symbols '=/&amp;/etc' to represent how binding works for a particular Angular expression. This means when doing any kind of complex directive, you spend most of your time with your head buried in Angular's rather poor directive documentation to find out what they all mean and how they work.

Convention over configuration - modularity should not cone at cost. JS world needs to learn it.
http://riotjs.com/ might be a good pill
This is a symptom of how the conversation is driven by ADHDers who drop into projects push them out the door and then move onto the next one before anyone realises that the framework they chose isn't even at version 1.0 yet and will be abandoned in 6 months, all the while tweeting how much their stack is the new hotness. There is little regard or respect for long term stability and maturity when these tools and frameworks are chosen. Some advice to anyone who finds the tooling situation confusing: * You don't have to choose new tools and frameworks for each new project. If something worked fine for you last time, then keep on using it. Why change? * If you value long term code and project stability in your tools (and you should), then there are only a handful of viable options for each major decision. * It is good to keep a eye on what is happening, but things don't change all that fast. You can safely ignore most new frameworks which appear. If one gains some popularity (over a period of a few years) then it might be worth checking it out. If books appear for it then that might also be a sign to examine it. 
[great list of ReactJS talks](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react/#videos). A lot of them are just good JS talkings even if you aren't a React person.
I really like [Kyle Simpson](http://getify.me/) talk. You can find some of his books on Github ([You don't know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/README.md#you-dont-know-js-book-series)).
Yep, it's "just" a node app!
[Hexo](https://hexo.io/) [VueJS](http://vuejs.org/) website is made with it.
This kind of decision making, while common with multi-million dollar web applications, would destroy your career in any other industry. Consider, outside the web, when any company was happy to invest millions of development dollars into a major service offering with a maximum lifespan of only 3-5 years, and could not be turned off or thrown away without additional considerable expense, and no replacement plan.
Bah sorry I missed that, thanks for posting it here.
Glad you like it.
I use to agree with this (have worked on large scale ember apps) but I now think it's only true for certain teams. If you have a bunch of rails developers or a team that hasn't built a production grade SPA before Ember is a good choice. If you have a team of node devs and experienced front end js devs React+Redux might be a better choice. Boilerplates solve a lot of the issues configuration brings, you don't always have to start at square 1
React doesn't have the same convention Ember does. I use pods structure in my React apps (crazy right?) and have to explain it to pretty much every other dev who hasn't used Ember. Would be nice to have a customizable CLI 
yeah https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/3xyaos/well_f_you_too_kyle_simpson/
Sorry but from what I know, didn't oracle/sun put out java first and then netscape named theirs javascript, so the fault should have been on netscape?
Under-promise, over-deliver. The worst thing you can do for yourself is let the people running the company get unrealistic expectations for how your work will proceed. This also means you should be as transparent with them as possible. Don't turn into a black box that spits out code every once in a while. Hold regular meetings to keep them in the loop. The more they know, the easier your job will go. And it sounds like they are not unreasonable people. I've dealt with that before and it can be hellish. As long as you're up front and honest with them, it should go well.
Just realize this quick sample is misleadingly named. It is *replacing* the class with the given class, not adding the class. The larger code sample from another above points out the way to truly just append a class. Naming matters, `setClass` or `replaceClass` are both more appropriate names for the sample given here.
I am. You can do it, you can't be an expert at everything, but you can know enough to get the job done. It will take time, and you will have to learn new things on the fly constantly. But you can do it, none of these technologies are beyond you given enough time. Be satisfied when you know enough to get the job-at-hand done and keep notes about stuff you should look into later if there is enough time. You won't be able to spend weeks optimizing one little thing, but thats ok too. Mistakes will be made, but they will be more valuable than anything for pushing your knowledge further. In some ways its actually nice to be the sole full-stack guy, you will have total control. All the blame all the responsibility all the glory!
As a 'yes' man...I agree with this guy 100%! Communication is key. Manage their expectations.
First question, do you like the idea of working on a MEAN stack application? If the answer is yes, then go for it. It's a great opportunity for you to learn and expand your skills, and you will learn a great deal very quickly. The quickest way to learn is on the job, so it's a perfect situation. If you're worried they have grandiose plans you'll never be able to deliver on, then ask a few questions now about how they expect the company the project is for to grow, what the current/expected user base is (finger in air time rough estimates). Check the other stuff too, are they offering money, and the right amount for you? Be wary of being transitioned to a different type of contract, it's not always bad, but it can be, those sorts of things. 
Bolierplate IS a configuration. 99% of the time you don't need either of them.
Pick any existing starter kit or make your own one, and voila, you have your rapid prototyping environment. Problem solved. A small webpack config file is hardly boilerplate, it's configuration. If you want to use one magical tool that does everything from you in a convention-over-configuration sort of way, you can do that. But guess what, that ubertool will be not much more than a preconfigured combination of existing utilities that you have a problem using, because they're so configurable. All this is a non-issue.
It's for people whose bracket keys are broken. 
This tweet irritated me a bit: Too many newbies getting overwhelmed by react's learning curve. Everybody is a newb at *something* their whole life. It is the job of every programmer to constantly be learning new ideas and techniques. If someone doesn't want to, then let them find another profession. Do not let the lowest common denominator in your group drive the design. React is *simple*. One full day working on an example project should be a good start. 
It's for people who enjoy languages like Python, Haskell, and Ruby, or who are functional programmers at heart. (i.e., think of programs primarily in terms of functions). ES6 has stolen many of its good bits, but there are still plenty of things CS has that ES6 doesn't. Some CS strengths: * Simple functional notation * Easy to create DSLs ala Ruby and Haskell (due to implicit applicatives) * Easy to express callback blocks (implicit applicatives + arrow notation + indented blocks) * Literate programming syntax (a little like Perl's POD documentation, but using Markdown) * High performance and strong backward compatibility (as compared to ES6 transpilers; CS doesn't generate any JS on its own that doesn't work with the earliest JS engines, including IE6) Most of CoffeeScript's advantages are primarily *expressive*: they allow a developer more flexibility in how a particular operation is presented, in order to emphasize the code's intended *function* over its form. (The flip side, of course, is that more expressive languages -- by their very nature -- give people more freedom to express shitty things as well as masterpieces. But that's always the price of freedom, and not just in programming languages!)
I use it heavily. I like: Clean syntax Everything is an expression (this is huge) Variable declaration happens automatically Cleaner function syntax and this binding Null soaking operators Destructuring Default args Allows incredibly expressive, terse, highly functional code. That being said, most people seem unable to read it easily so that's a negative. 
You could serialize them to json and compare the lengths of the resulting strings. 
For me it is one simple reason. It looks pretty.
It has pretty much outlived its usefulness. Even in terms of keypresses it loses against languages with better tooling like TypeScript. And, well, CS' tooling is pretty bad. Even with plain ES6 you'd be *way* better off. I recommend to go with ES6 or, if you like things like type annotations, decorators, async/await, enums, and some [duct tape for ES3/5 option objects](http://i.imgur.com/QMIvrKn.gif), give TypeScript a try.
&gt; Like if I have 1000 shoes Aaand... doesn't matter. With an N that small, you can do the dumbest thing imaginable and you'd be still done in less than 1 ms. In general, if you don't have any points of reference for what you're trying to do, just go with the most straightforward most convenient approach. Get it to work first. Once it works correctly, see if it feels sluggish (it probably won't). If so, profile it to figure out where the actual bottlenecks are (they are probably in a different part of your application). https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/cpu-profiling https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Performance If you guess how fast something might be, you're generally wrong. And if you write micro benchmarks, you're typically measuring the wrong thing. Writing good benchmarks is actually surprisingly difficult. Even VM engineers can't accurately tell what some micro benchmark is measuring without using special tools to take a closer look. Conveniently, you only care about the performance of your actual application. So, profiling it with your actual real-world data is the best thing you can do. The application itself is the most relevant benchmark there could be. See also: https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/3uuk17/performance_and_benchmarking_issues_with_jsperf/
Its sort of morphed into the post-LAMP stack. Mongo/NoSql, Angular/React/Ember/Whatever, Nginx/AWS...
Doesn't Vjeux work for Facebook on the React Native team? That does sound like a strange comment to be made from someone who should be very familiar with the framework.
Here is a simple event delegation demo. It uses `Element.matches` (`msMatchesSelector` for IE/Edge) to figure out if the element is relevant and `Element.classList.toggle` to toggle a class. https://jsfiddle.net/v5jwu7t6/ If you need better compatibility with outdated browsers, you're probably better off using jQuery. See also: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Element/matches https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Element/classList http://caniuse.com/matchesselector http://caniuse.com/classlist
Far far far away. Don't sweat it, just use the transpilers, let them sweat it out, and win!
I'm also a bit confused on this. ES6 is now called "ES2015" because it was supposed to be implemented by the end of this year right? Or am I off on that?
Structure the code in the way that makes the most sense given the data you have and the way you want to access it. In this case that probably means a clean OOP design that has a `closet ` that's an array of `shoe` objects, each with their own attributes. **Then**, **if** you end up with enough shoes that efficiency **empirically** becomes an issue for you, consider restructuring the code to optimise it. Hint: this is unlikely to be the case for you unless you have *millions* of pairs of shoes. Also, never, ever guess - code, profile, measure, and *only* optimise once you've proven its a problem. Premature optimisation is the root of all evil.
It's so named because the spec was finalized in 2015 -- I don't think implementation can be scheduled like that. It'll be up to the browser vendors. 
A single array of objects is the 'proper' OO design approach for this sort of task. Unless you're facing real performance bottlenecks where you need to shave off every microsecond, doing it the way that is easier to program with is better than doing it the way that runs faster. That aside...well, I'm not an expert, but my guess would be that it depends what you're generally *doing* with the data, and also whether you're more concerned with space or time constraints. Multiple arrays will probably give you a better memory footprint, and if you want to look at aggregates of only one type of data (e.g. the total number of shoes, regardless of their color or any other properties), that will probably run fastest using the multiple-array approach. On the other hand, arbitrary accesses of single shoes one at a time may work faster using the multiple-object approach. But the only way to know for sure is to test it, modern Javascript engines have an ungodly amount of optimization wizardry built into them and it's tough to say in advance how that will play into performance in any particular scenario.
When apple decides to either let their browsers die or get on with the fucking times.
Sounds like you want an array (the closet) of objects (the shoes). The best optimization for small data sets like yours is to represent the data as simply and understandably as possible. Since JS `Array`s are really just `Object`s, their computational efficiency is almost identical. An excerpt from Douglas Crockford's book, *JavaScript: The Good Parts*, says: &gt; The rule is simple: when the property names are small sequential integers, you should use an array. Otherwise, use an object. The most important goal is usually to make the program as readable as possible. Computational optimization can come later. Here's a bonus example from that book, that shows how an `Array` and `Object` can represent the same data almost identically: // as an array var numbers = [ 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine' ]; // as an object var numbers_object = { '0': 'zero', '1': 'one', '2': 'two', '3': 'three', '4': 'four', '5': 'five', '6': 'six', '7': 'seven', '8': 'eight', '9': 'nine' }; 
Great advice. Particularly the recommendation to keep track of what you don't know. Being in such a position can be quite rewarding and will make you a great developer over time.
Oh no, my stats! How will I apply for jobs without my Github profile!?
I do, but that doesn't mean that I don't find all the ecosystem pretty frustrating to work with. Facebook engineers do not have to worry about it that much because everything is already setup for them, they can just add a js file, run jest or flow and it'll work great. What's annoying is when you want to setup all those tools for a new open source project. It is very time consuming and not very rewarding. I really want to make this whole process easier.
Or are sick and tired of using brackets when whitespace is more than sufficient. 
That makes more sense. I wasn't quite sure what the question was asking for, so I didn't change OP's original code and just added the comments.
&gt; That's very broad. I'm really curious if using tried/tested methodologies would really destroy your career in any other industry. There is no evidence to suggest common JavaScript frameworks meet any sort of certification or compliance to any recognized governance. For instance which JavaScript frameworks have been audited by ISC2, IEEE, NIST, DOD, or any other recognized regulatory body? I am guessing by *tried/tested* you mean popular. If so, then yes, in any other industry that would destroy your career. I remember that Angular 1 couldn't get accessibility to an acceptable level. They tried, but the heavy use of directives always got in the way... epic fail. &gt; I'd ask for an example, but you've said that any company is willing to invest millions of dollars on a 3-5 year lifespan. Let's take the extreme minimal example.... a team of three people propping up some web tool for 3 years would average an expense of $900,000 development dollars presuming they are paid $100,000 each. A team of 30 developers propping up a web tool for 3 years would cost $9,000,000. That is only labor and presumes the time line never slips.
You can't use classes (FF), `let` (FF), default function parameters (Cr), destructuring (Cr), or block-level functions (FF). For-loop iteration scope is also b0rked in Firefox. I wouldn't say that this qualifies as using ES6.
Yes! saw him at Web Unleashed this year and loved his talk AND his open source booky books!
I am talking about user's browsing experience.
Yeah, I'm in agreement with most of what you said. Still: &gt; In about 18 weeks the stable versions will support the important stuff is what you actually said. I have no problem with a statement saying "in 18 months **ALL** will be supported", but what I have in alpha today, will be in official stable release in... what? 3 months? 6? So I'm guessing for desktops most of the "important stuff" will come out next year, and then we waste those remaining 6 months nagging about the same in mobile browsers :/ I'm just really concerned about one thing: modules. That's the one of the important stuff that may actually take 18 months :S
Well, I am a novice programmer so please bear with me. Actually, I am trying to create a Chrome browser extension that has such functionality. As far as I know, I can write Chrome extension in javascript and that is why I was looking for such library in javascript. Could you please explain what you mean by brower's extension API function?
&gt; but what I have in alpha today, will be in official stable release in... what? 3 months? 6? Chrome and Firefox do a version step every ~6 weeks. ~18 weeks = 3 version steps. &gt; I'm just really concerned about one thing: modules. That's the one of the important stuff that may actually take 18 months :S Well, the spec isn't quite done yet. That's why. https://github.com/ModuleLoader/es6-module-loader https://github.com/whatwg/loader
Now. As I see it, if adding Babel to your workflow isn't a 5 minute process that you do once and then forget about, you've got larger issues you need to address.
I only used it with cordova apps but local storage is persistent.
First off, you generally want to optimize for code clarity. Write code that is easy to write and (especially) easy for you to come back and read later. Unless you're doing something very, very specific, the difference between array lookup or object lookups is meaningless; what matters is the cognitive overhead *you* have to, eg, write some code that grabs a specific shoe. So with that said, the general rule is that if you care about fast/easy lookups by ID, then you should store objects in a dict, when in JS is usually simulated by an object. So something like `shoes = {5: {id: 5, color: red}, 12: {id: 12, color: green}};`, because now you can easily grab a shoes when you know it's ID; `shoes[12]` gets you the shoes with an id of 12. On the other hand, if you care about ordering (ie, you rarely want to grab a specific shoe, but often want to loop through them *in order), you'd store them in an array, so something like `shoes = [{id: 5, color: red}, {id: 12, color: green}];`. Now you need to loop through the array checking IDs to find a specific shoe (which is important, again, not so much because it's slow to run, but mostly because it's a pain for you as the programmer), but the shoes have a defined order, which might be important. And if you care about lookup by ID *and* ordering, you could store the IDs in an array and the objects in a tree, so something like `shoes = [5, 12];` and then `shoesById = {5: {id: 5, color: red}, 12: {id: 12, color: green}};`. &gt; Or I can make a object(my closet) and store array containing the properties of each shoe in the properties of that object (e.g mycloset.color=['yellow','red','blue'], mycloset.numberofshoe=3). That sounds like a terrible idea, off the top of my head. You aren't getting the fast lookups by ID you would with pure objects, but you still aren't able to usefull re-order your shoes, since doing so would require you to re-order every single property array. Worst of both worlds, really. More generally, you should probably think about the metric you have in mind when you ask something about what's "more efficient". What code is easier for you to write? Easier for your to maintain? What code will use less RAM when executed? What code will allow the creation of data structures the fastest? What code will allow queries of the data structures the fastest? Will this code be executed 30 times a second, or when the user clicks a button? Is your `n` less than 1000, less than a million, less than a billion? Etc. TL;DR: Shove it in an object and move on with your life; if it ever becomes a problem fix it then.
So MEAN is not commonly used to mean anything else? Okay. Now I have differing responses!
And reading brackets 
The existential opperator is the single feature that still makes it worth using.
These are super neat. Side note: I did not know that blogging website style was a general theme and assumed a single person was writing articles like a mad man. Now I know it's from svbtle. Oops. 
Like Visual Studio which still doesn't support all of C99?
Neat idea. I would check to see if the site has any "wins" before calculating these statistics, though, so as not to display NaN on the page: Avg. Time Diff: NaN Seconds Std Dev: NaN 10th Percentile: NaN Seconds
I really like the existential operator. I really hope we see it some day.
Been playing with redux the last couple days. I like it, it's simple and decouples our app engine with our app presentation. We are lucky that we are only supporting modern browsers, so we will eventually get rid of jQuery soon as our views don't use it. (I'm moving our legacy jquery code into 'View' wrappers and phasing them out as change requests come in). Thank you for the list of links. Cheers!
Or landscape
You can target specific ES versions with typescript and TS offers more robust features. 
I thought this too, if they really have billions why would they hire a lone developer for this job, and also one that has no prior JS job experience, something is not adding up. 
&gt; I've heard even things like lodash filter being faster than native filter... Native functions often have to cover complicated edge cases from the ECMAScript specification, which put them at a [performance disadvantage](https://github.com/codemix/fast.js#how). 
This is pretty much the direction I'm looking at! Thank you, will try it out anf see what i can get!
Will look into sails.js! Thank you!
&gt; It's funny how functions written in JS are now faster than actual native functions. The stuff written in C++ is fast. The slowness comes from crossing that bridge. It's also like that in Java, for example. Calling some native function in some dll/so does come with quite a bit of overhead. So, the more work you can do with a single call, the better. &gt; I've heard even things like lodash filter being faster than native filter That's because it does less. The built-in one skips holes whereas lodash's doesn't. https://jsfiddle.net/s8v30b4a/ https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter#Polyfill
I only see about the top 25% of the screen or so. Also, how do you ever grow bigger if you start out the smallest size and everything you touch eats you?
Yeah, it displays better now. Still ridiculously fast and I always get eaten in less than a second. :P
that's what makes it super competitive :D
No steps should be added for the developers as they should just need to do a git clone.
Yeah... that sucks. I was huge. Then it dropped me down, so i closed the window.
Haha, that's awesome! I might give it a go on meteor :)
*A relevant comment in this thread was deleted. You can read it below.* ---- `beginPath` starts the definition of a path. A path is a sort of grouping, it's a number of drawing commands that will be treated together when actually stroking them. `closePath` is, first of all, _not_ the symmetric to `beginPath`. Because it does not _end_ a path. It's merely another drawing command that draws a line from wherever you are to the beginning of the path. It's use is mostly optional (read at the end to see it's usefulness) Now, to understand why you'd want to define various paths, you have to think about the actual visual properties of the path. You see, there are drawing commands like `lineTo` and then there are properties that set _how_ that line will actually be drawn.

For the love of god, please make the "you've been eaten" modal something non-modal. I couldn't even close the tab without having to block all future alert()'s from the page :[ That said, omg I actually giggled a bunch playing this. :]
Bahaha yeah sorry about that, I just removed it now.
I think larger ones should also move a little slower.
What about doing size decay that scales with the current size? Make the map bigger and the little guys just have to run away!
It was great before Babel/TypeScript/Elm arrived.
Use algorithms for a spring contracting through fluid, and adjust the viscosity of the fluid based on your size!
Curator of the second list you posted here. It's always funny to see my repo explode when it goes on reddit. I'm not programming that much JS nowadays, but some of my favorite speakers are listed already. I will try to reiterate: * Reginald Braithwraite: I really like this guy. His talks are fun and I always learn tons (see [The Art of the JS Metaobject protocol](https://vimeo.com/97415345) and [JS Combinators](https://vimeo.com/97408202)). * David Nolen: He is the maintainer of ClojureScript and, like Rich Hickey, he's a great mind. His talks are more focused on Clojure these days (understandably), but they're still cool (one of my personal favorites is [Immutability, Interactivity and JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS264h8KGwk)) * Douglas Crockford: of course. He does not need an introduction (if you don't know him, just look him up). I really like his [Monads and Gonads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0EF0VTs9Dc) talk.
I think someone's cheating / scripted winning. Everyone just gets eaten by him as soon as they spawn.
Yes. They said OK. The feeling I got was they understood somewhat, and said if the workload is too high it would justify more staff.
I'm literally working with Mongo / Express / Angular / Node.
It was originally written by an agency. It's obvious they just tried to get it done as quick as possible. The owners are aware of this. The product is functioning (mostly) but it's a little bit hacked together. It's a complex product. There is almost zero documentation and right now I know very little about the infrastructure etc. However the bosses understand this and aren't expecting me to be magic. Mongo does work pretty well for this product (I usually don't like Mongo) but it's possible I'll need to migrate to a different DB as the product grows. I get the feeling very little thought was put into the architecture. As I said, they just wanted to get the product out the door. My feeling is they will listen to my advice if I say we need to do X or Y. The product will only be used by private clients (it's not public facing) so there will be no telephone calls at midnight. However I may be expected to hack some shit together before a sales pitch on the Monday or whatever.
The code is a bit of a mess alright. Unfortunately a lot of it is mathematical so it's quite hard to understand. I've explained this to my bosses though and they understand, so... fingers crossed!
The product is literally Mongo / Express / Angular / Node.
I created a fiddle to test the differences: https://jsfiddle.net/1kavbe7p/4/ (Caution: it will make your browser unresponsive!). The result from Chrome: * lodash_bind: 4121ms. * closure: 2847ms. * native_bind: 13891ms. From Safari: * lodash_bind: 4357ms. * closure: 1873ms. * native_bind: 3402ms. Another fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/1kavbe7p/6/ to test binding only `this`. The interesting result is that `lodash` bind is as fast as closure in this case.
Honestly, the slow homepage zoom on mobile is irritating When I get to a desktop, I'll spend the next month trying everything 
FYI, Safari nighly (WebKit) is currently second in the ES6 race at 81%. The only thing that Apple should do is increment the frequency of pulls to stable Safari, since it is an amazing browser and absolutely does not deserve to die.
Does transpiling not shoot you in the foot when it comes to debugging? I've never tried it, but it seems that debugging in the browser would be a pain with this workflow.
Look at the side bar for resources.
There is a great amount of lag, not only server lag but also input lag.
True, but I mean getting used to using new tools. My team uses Visual Studio and Web Essentials for task automation and isn't used to configuring tasks with Gulp or Grunt. It's tough because Web Essentials' configuration isn't portable like Gulp's is.
A few things to point out: 1. Most your bots spawn in the same spot, so a user can just stay in that spot and continuously grow without moving. 2. It's difficult to differentiate your circle from others. 3. Keyboard entry doesn't seem to work.
I took out one of the iframes, it should work again. It's a bug with a specific earlier version of iOS9. :( 
Thanks - and that's a good point. I have the statistics to accumulate so hopefully by tomorrow HackerNews has some wins as well!
Why
&gt; I hope by this time, you guys have got an idea to understand major differences between Selenium and PhantomJS testing tool Well, they have nothing in common, so... PhantomJS is a browser (an headless browser, but a browser nonetheless), while Selenium is a user (a virtual user, but a user nonetheless). The two can be used together, but they don't compete against each other. Now as for my personal opinion: despite being a nice idea, PhantomJS should be avoided. Use Chrome (and/or Firefox) instead: you will test your website under real conditions, and will be able to run your tests on an actual browser (much easier to visually debug when something goes wrong). If you need to run your tests headless (and you probably will), just use xvfb-run and be done with it.
Good article, always like seeing people trying to convince and teach people the worth of regexs. I took years before I started using them as I have a bad memory and it always seemed to complicated. But I kept trying every now and then and now I know the absolute basics and even just that has come in use time and time again. You should show an example or two on why they should bother learning it, like how is it going to make their lives easier. My fav thing is replacing, no more indexof, substr, crap. Like the following (just had need of this;), show em what it looks like without the regex, yeah it might be easier to read at first, but once you know the basics youll prolly do it the regex way every time after :P 'etcetc[variableName]etcetc'.replace(/(\[).*?(\])/, '$1REPLACEMENT$2') Hate to cliche, but if I can do em anyone can.....just dont tell em it took me years ;)...but that was coz I was over reaching, you really do only need the basics. EDIT: Actually, the code I used was like the below, and is a great example of how regexs make life easier.....that would be ugly without regexs. map={ variableName:'REPLACEMENT' } console.log( 'etcetc[variableName]etcetc'.replace(/(\[)(.*?)(\])/, function(match,group1,group2,group3){ return group1+map[group2]+group3; }) ) And the next example ;)... map={ variableName:'REPLACEMENT', anotherOne:'REPLACED' } console.log( 'etcetc[variableName]etcetc[anotherOne]etcetcetc'.replace(/(\[)(.*?)(\])/g, function(match,group1,group2,group3){ return group1+map[group2]+group3; }) )
Can you post your canvas code? Been playing with it on Meteor and testing how fast collections can update or if I need to move to Redis and would be interested to see the player drawing. 
I know, I am saying that at some point you will want to refactor into version 2 and you will not want to be stuck with all of those choices necessarily. The reason I said that was because people were confused in this thread thinking that MEAN could mean basically any JS app. And because it is a such a cool name some people don't realize that things have continued to evolve.
The Chrome Extension API: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/api_index APIs for performing tasks on the browser or as part of the browser itself. In your case, see the webRequest API.
&gt; clue what it means... I see a "type your name" bit of text. I try typing on the keyboard... no response. I try moving around some more... just more spastic flashing and popping... maybe I'm controlling... text in the lower right... keyboard input still does nothing... &gt; I close the browser tab. It's a real time multiplayer game, you're playing with others - those circles represent other user's mouse locations. Collide the circles and the larger proceeds. 
Thanks.
What is that array doing? (the one getting put in console) is that each player or something? 
I've been working on this side project for a couple of months, and I think it's finally in OK enough shape to share. The tl;dr is that Runiq is a Lisp-esque language that runs on a simple JavaScript interpreter. It's sort of my attempt to take some cool things about Lisp (simple syntax, code-as-data), plus some cool things about JS (community, reach, the fact that it's my favorite language to code in), and merge them together. I wrote this mainly as an experiment and a personal challenge, but I still think it could find a niche. Runiq is general purpose enough to do "real" programming tasks, but it's also pluggable and can host very simplified DSLs. Maybe I'm dreaming here but I could see using a Runiq-based DSL to teach beginners how to code. One motivation I also had was trying to make a language that I could sort of adjust the power of for different applications. E.g., running untrusted code in a game that requires a bit of programming to play. You could easily use Runiq to create a micro-language that could only do basic algebra. Runiq is free and open source (ISC license). Happy to answer any questions here. 
Until they read locations from the global variable `scene_buffer`...
Ahh okay, yeah I've only got one single server configured in US
&gt; **Why we bundle modules** &gt; Bundling modules means combining several files with modules into a single file. That is done for three reasons: &gt; 1. Fewer files need to be retrieved in order to load all modules. &gt; 2. Compressing the bundled file is slightly more efficient than compressing separate files. &gt; 3. During bundling, unused exports can be removed, potentially resulting in significant space savings. http://www.2ality.com/2015/12/bundling-modules-future.html
I think I want to add the ability to "shoot" each other e.g. you use mass as ammo. I want to restrict movement to mouse, so what if the keyboard directional was the shooter key / direction (we're restricted to 8 direction tho). Or should I swap it so keyboard becomes movement and mouse is shooter? I like using mouse as location because you really jump anywhere on screen immediately. 
Much appreciated

It's only slightly annoying, but I've moved to fully es2015 with &lt;script type="babel"&gt; in my tags, and I heavily use mixins, so the vast majority of complex logic ends up in regular .js files. I'm also using webpack, and with babel that means I can just import './file.tag' into whatever js file does the riot.mount(). A lot of the babel6/webpack/riot workflow has only very recently worked well, the riot guys made a babel preset pack for riot as well, very recently, that solved a lot of my issues. I had jshint linting my &lt;script&gt; tags, but there doesn't seem to be good support in eslint for that sort of thing without a plugin (which doesn't seem to exist for tag files yet... perhaps that's a good project for today...). Edit: actually, it appears someone made one: https://github.com/txchen/eslint-plugin-riot
Can you post the code for your pop up html and js? 
Good point! I'll make sure to include an example of how it makes life much easier :)
Not entirely sure what you're trying to do... Does this help? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/QyGbzX
I'm getting an error after typing in the command to create app `Error: Can't connect to HTTPS URL because the SSL module is not available.` Anyone know why or how to resolve this? 
I'm going to try to make a [bable plugin](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/) for it. I've got one project that needs to be written in js and it's really killing me not having it.
Macros are the next feature I'd like to add. I don't suspect it'll be too hard, but I want to make sure I get the implementation right. A couple of weeks, maybe.
Indeed it does, a much cleaner way of doing what I was trying to hah. Though I am interested in why the switch statement doesn't work so I don't make the same mistake in the future. 
Make sure you are taking React for what it is, not for the extras people put with react. By itself React has no AJAX handling. By itself it doesn't do routing. If you add the router to it it's React + React-router.
Thanks !
https://www.pluralsight.com/ is work a look.
For routing, I never got React-router working right on Apache, even with some example .htaccess files I have found online. I use [Routie](http://projects.jga.me/routie/) which is small and simple.
Frontend Masters has the best JS material, of which some is on Pluralsight. I currently have both and I use Frontend Masters the most.
I love Scheme and JavaScript, so this is exciting. Though I'm curious why it's called runiq but you've demonstrated a `.rune` file extension?
&gt; How does target.matches evaluate based on which browser? "target" is an `Element` instance. In current versions of Firefox, Chrome, or Safari, `Element` instances have a "matches" method. Since functions are [truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy) values, my "matches" variable gets set to `"matches"`. With IE/Edge, `Element` instances don't have a "matches" property. `undefined` is a [falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy) value, which means my "matches" variable will get set to `"msMatchesSelector"`. So, if a "matches" method exist, my variable will contain the string "matches", which means that funny looking line will be like: target["matches"]('.clicky') which is the same as: target.matches('.clicky') And in browsers which do not have that method, it will be like: target["msMatchesSelector"]('.clicky') which is the same as: target.msMatchesSelector('.clicky') So, basically, I use the "matches" method if it exists and I unconditionally assume that a "msMatchesSelector" exists if the "matches" one doesn't exist. If you check the compatibility chart, you'll see that this covers all current browsers except for Opera Mini.
That's basically my position. Frankly, without JS, I can't build the sites I want to build, and probably more importantly, if the user isn't running JS, I can't show them ads, so they're zombie traffic anyways.
Oh boy. This is going to be good. Paging Eric Elliott.
Your code isn't passing any attributes to the `getContext` method.
If you write back-end code, [most of] it already is.
I really like the `.rune` extension :) Just was curious as it deviated from the project's name. Can you explain maybe `runiq` ?
I have found most JS devs to be very similar to the Eric Elliot reddit's come to hate. Loud, ignorantly opinionated and sometimes just wildly incorrect. It seems in the current JS market it pays to be loud and aggressive about your opinions, even if they're totally wrong.
Second this. Kyle Simpson does an excellent job.
Amazing is maybe a bit of a stretch.
It pays to be loud and aggressive anywhere. See also: * Vaccination debate * Donald Trump * Pro-lifers * Anti-gay-marriage activists
Nah.
If you want to run client side routing without using hashes (as Angular does out of the box), you have to inform Apache to ignore nested paths in the URL so it sends all requests to the root instead. For example if say in your SPA you have a route that goes to "search/", in a default configuration the server would try to find an index.* file in a "search" folder which doesn't exist. This isn't a problem if you go to "search/" from the root, but it breaks the site if you try to go directly to it on a new page. So if the file doesn't exist, you need to tell Apache to serve index.html at the root instead. This got tricky for me with React-router, even tried other routing libraries like Page.js, and what happened was if I pointed my browser directly to a nested path, it served *every* file as index.html, even my included JavaScript files. So the site would be completely broken if one were to directly enter a non-root path in the browser. It was likely an error in .htaccess but I couldn't figure it out before finally settling with hashes and the lightweight Routie library.
I totally agree with you. I think it's kind of silly to say "JavaScript has this robust set of tools, but it is never okay to use them." *edit* Also, I said most because of the handful of JS devs that are very intelligent and level headed. I have yet to work with a full-time JS dev that isn't overly militant about something stupid.
Thanks! I'll have a proper look tomorrow, only started skimming through it. https://moltin.com/ if anybody else wanted a pointer
Nice! I did a talk at CampJS in Australia recently about debugging a memory leak in a Node.js native add-on (C++), but the video isn't up, yet.

[Here's a page](http://vuejs.org/guide/comparison.html) that I always thought was helpful when looking at different frameworks. Not nearly every framework is covered but the three you're looking for are. It's from the guy who writes Vue so of course leans in that direction but he's mostly just talking about philosophical differences. I guess one thing is he doesn't cover Angular 2.0 at all, which might as well be a completely different framework than Angular 1.x.

What do you think about him bashing Mocha and recommending Tape for testing instead?
I assume you're referring to [this](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/why-i-use-tape-instead-of-mocha-so-should-you-6aa105d8eaf4#.2ziwj16cq). If so, the main points I see in that article are: * Your tools should not need an excessive amount of configuration * Prefer smaller tools and libraries over larger ones These two points are fairly uncontroversial. One of the most upvoted articles to this subreddit this week was [entirely complaining about how much configuration was hurting them](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/3ycx8k/javascript_fatigue/). We've built tools for our tools just to deal with all of this configuration. I think these two points are worth recognizing and keeping in mind. This is what I mean about filtering out the hyperbole - here's even his TLDR which makes it crystal clear this is what he's on about: &gt; TL;DR: Mocha is a $150k Porsche Panamera when the best tool for the job is a $30k Tesla Model 3. Don’t waste your resources on testing bells and whistles. Invest them in creating your app, instead. *However*, I don't find his particular arguments here all that convincing and I don't think any less of mocha after reading them. Out of all of the complexity in javascript tool chains you can have, unit testing is one of the areas where things are not that bad, and mocha is not so monolithic in my mind to warrant the "use micro libraries!" argument. That's actually my problem with his articles in general. He's touching on some valid points but in a weird kind of facile way, going off on a tangent about *the one true way* to solve this problem instead of directly thinking about it.
?? Nothing wrong with my code, it's running fine. getContext returns an object in this instance. 
&gt; I've had this desire to make something absolutely from scratch. Well, as much as possible. Like the endeavour to go out into the woods, find a rock, make shards, get some branches, make an axe, get a tree, get some lumber, etc etc. until I have a bird house or something. [You will enjoy this video of someone doing precisely that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCKkHqlx9dE)
Great article! Thanks. :)
Ugh. Decorum fail. Protip: attack the argument, not the person.
Or you know all of the countless conferences he talks at and he's a very well known author... 
But _.extend is composition: _.extend({}, {a:1}, {b:2}) == {a:1,b:2} It's alias is _.assign... so extend is basically like the composition example from the post. http://underscorejs.org/#extend
Have you got a backronym figured out yet?
This is a great answer. It's not the minification, rather the concatenation that will create syntax errors due to missing semicolons. Consider the last line in a file is missing a semicolon. When concatenated with a second file, the first line of the second file will begin immediately after the missing semicolon (no line terminator) and result in an error. If the files were linked separately, the parser would insert a semicolon at the end of the file (end of stream), and avoid the error. There is an exception to this behavior if the line ends with a }. It's all explained in the ECMAScript spec. 
I remember looking into it and thinking it was impressive, but I don't think it's isomorphic and the ecosystem around react (testing tools/guides, especially) eventually quelled my desire to look around. 
Glad you liked it! :)
