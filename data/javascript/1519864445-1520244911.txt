I feel like class muddied the waters. For me, at least. The semantics are easy to understand, but it becomes, I think, less easy to think about than prototypes. Felt a bit like shoehorning to me. 
Naw, refactor rename is used all of the time by senior devs too. Model classes in particular may be modified over time until their class name is no longer descriptive. Although you’ll start to use things like refactor pull up methods/fields to base class or push down methods/fields as you start to abstract away things just as often. But my favorite thing to do is just straight up deleting code.
TypeScript - JavaScript with OMG EACH YEAR COMES MORE SHIT OUT THAT ADDS TO YOUR TOOLCHAIN SO YOU CAN DEPLOY 300MB WORTH OF NOTHING TO CREATE YOUR TO DO LIST APP
I tried to use TypeScript for a project but eventually gave up. There were a few cases where some library I needed had old type definitions or some other weird issue - eventually I got frustrated trying to figure those things out and switched back to regular JavaScript. 
The toolchain you have to set up to get anything decent going in FrontEnd dev is straight out insane and retarded. Compile to JavaScript is a decease that has to be rottet out along with the people that made them and the people that use them. Maybe then we can do things take make sense like FOR FUCKS SAKE JUST DEVELOPING ECMA SCRIPT AND HAVE IT RUN VANILLA IN THE BROWSER. Seriously, the whole world went crazy and the JavaScript community especially 
You can define unnamed types with typescript, which is very useful in that situation. For example: function someFunc(): { x: number, message: string } { return { x: 34, message: "hello" }; } This can greatly reduce the number of types you need to create due to one off return types/parameter types in functions. 
Yes it matters. Some JS code has variables that are made in the local scope where the script tag has to be at the end. Leave them where they are. 
TS is for the losers that peeked from BackEnd development into FrontEnd and just couldn't stand the culture shock of weakly typed language. Why the don't learn something new instead of forcing their strongly typed bullshit on us is beyond me
&gt;Q1 - How can something that is compiled to Javascript in the end can be better than Javascript itself? C just compiles to machine code in the end. Why write programs in C when you could just write them in machine code, or assembly?
Flawed argument. We are not talking about lowest layer possible. We are talking about lowest common denominator. If you want to attach an eventListener to an element node, the lowest you can go is Javascript. IMO, that's the basket where the eggs should be. Of course, everyone is free to add as much middle man as they want. I don't care. What I care about is misinformation, misrepresentation.
While I get this makes websites look 'fancy' and there may be use cases for very minimal versions there is nothing worse than flashy websites with way too much animation impacting your ability to actually just read. WordPress templates with excessive flair annoy me particularly.
Scripts execute in the order they're placed in the document. Order of scripts can be important if one script depends on definitions supplied by another script (the one that depends on another should come after). Note: there are special rules when using `async` and `defer` for scripts, but if this is old code, they're likely not being used. Scripts may also refer to HTML elements in the document. If they do this, those elements will need to exist first. This is usually while you'll see scripts outside of the `&lt;head&gt;` and somewhere in the `&lt;body&gt;` such as the end, since that would guarantee those HTML elements exist. But scripts can also be smart enough to wait until the document has loaded before trying to access HTML elements. It depends on how the script was written. In the end, for what you're working with, scripts order and placement _could_ be very important, but it also might not be. Given that it sounds like there was some explicit placement done, rather than just a group of tags in the `&lt;head&gt;` its likely order is important.
So, eg, currently, when opac is 0, you want it to be 1; when it's 1, you want it to be 0; when it's 0.5, you want it to be 0.5; when it's 0.25, you want it to be 0.75 Can you think of any function that accomplishes that? `1 -`
&gt; I've never met a single TS dev that is capable of understanding how someone can have a different opinion or value different things. Are you sure? How many developers that use TypeScript have you talked to? How many of those developers never cared to mention that they use TypeScript and therefore don't show up in your anecdote? I think it's more likely that programming language zealots are more likely to be in your face about what languages they like/use, and are less likely to compromise over things opinions of this nature.
are you getting any errors in the console?
Nope
Where is `type` coming from? Is that the right value to compare in your if/else chain?
Yes, it is a global variable that is used to assign what item goes in what item goes in what slot in a different function. Maybe it would be better to have the assigning of the stats happen in the same function
Writing lots of HTML manually like that is both ugly and a pain. I would highly suggest using an array of objects instead. Also, don't implicitly create global variables, and what is `number` in your for loop? It's better to avoid for loops when possible. ECMAScript's Array contains a number of built-in methods for iteration (e.g., map, reduce, every, some, filter, and forEach). They relieve the need for manual iteration, provide better abstraction than a `for` loop, and make it clear what your iteration is doing. See https://gist.github.com/ljharb/58faf1cfcb4e6808f74aae4ef7944cff Also, what determines `type`? I would pass it as a parameter to the function, that way the function is more pure. Same for `i`, whatever it is. I would approach it like this: https://jsfiddle.net/LfLuyzqx/ An even more concise method of defining the objects, if you have tons of chests, is to use .map, like this: https://jsfiddle.net/LfLuyzqx/1/
TypeScript is awesome sauce. I don’t use Angular because I feel it is over complicated but damn I love ❤️ TypeScript. I have be coding professionally for 20 years and TypeScript is the first thing that really made my job easier in the last 10 years. Full Stack development has gotten way to complicated with developers expected to know everything from Angular to DevOps but TypeScript is one thing that make projects less complicated not more.
yes it does. and while postgres row-level security is not yet performant on very large data sets, it is a big priority and will happen soon. this is a beautiful thing once you see it in action. rls + role-based security makes this easy. check out the docs: https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/security/ postgraphile can manage jwt tokens easily and you can also use oauth with a little more work. if instead you were to implement graphql manually with, say graphqljs, you could just do a passport auth(or oauth, etc) and then apply your rules in the resolver layer
Neither should work because you have no semicolons...
Same question with semicolons.
While it looks cool, this is an accessibility nightmare.
Of course, Vue components are nearly perfect encapsulation.
The best transpiling
&gt; I kind of wish the typed JS community from flow snd ts could somehow merge If only :/
Nah man. Just be sure to rename all the model classes to super model names. Employee → Gisselle AccountData → MiaMalkova MenuItems → SashaGray
What do you use now?
I agree that docs and tests can be greatly improved. :) The general documentation (https://run.tools/docs) is obviously not good enough for many people that couldn't even get the problem I am trying to solve. But since English is not my native language (I'm French), writing good documentation is quite a challenge for me. Hopefully, as more people join the project, it will be better eventually. About the documentation of the resources, I think it should be auto-generated from the resource definitions. Currently, the best way to understand how to use a resource, it is to just invoke it with Run CLI. For example, if you have a `frontend` resource that imports `aws/s3-hosted-website`, you can get help by invoking `run frontend`. To get help on a particular attribute, just do `run frontend domainName`. And for a method, you have to specify `@help` before the method name (otherwise, the method would be invoked): `run frontend @help deploy`. There are already several attributes to document a resource (`@description`, `@examples`, `@default`, etc.), and I am thinking about adding more. For example, I would like to add an attribute (i.e. `@helpFile`) allowing to specify a Markdown file that could complement the auto-generated help.
Where I currently work we do the micro services approach so mostly Node but not limited to Node since everyone generally tries to use the best tool for each job (within reason). So me personally I work with two services that use Node, one Go service and one Scala service. I like it way better because each service is concise and easy to refactor or change. Plus deploys take seconds as opposed to 45 minutes with Rails. 
I can understand that! Just figured I would suggest it as I've known a few people that hadn't used IDEs with intellisense and it was life changing for them!
 grep ./* -re 'something'
I think you misspelled mispelled
Nah, I'm a Brit.
This
Hehehe. I see we have some JetBrains users here 
Or a decent IDE with JS support. It will warn you that you’re assigning a variable inside an if condition. It won’t stop you, but it will highlight that what you’re doing might not be exactly what you want!
Check out jetbrains' WebStorm; the refactoring tools are amazing. Something I use 10 times a day: `Ctrl + r + r` to refactor a method, including its name, parameter names, and parameter ordering. You can also select a selected block of code and extract it as a method, which pulls all of the variables used in that block and makes them parameters.
ReasonML might have mush more superpowers. Sure this is not Javascript anymore (but close).
ag is way faster than any other search tool I've used, and I use it constantly to search our massive git repo that's been collecting code for 15 years
If you’re going to do animations on scroll, have them synced to the scrolling and not triggered by a certain scroll position. Otherwise fast scrollers will have to wait to see page content - as is happening in this example. 
I think it was the sections "React without ES6" and React without JSX.
`Intl` is great. It's really a shame it's not packed directly into Node. The available builds only support the 'en-us' locale.. and they don't have any Intl-enabled builds.
&gt;As script-tags are loaded synchronously and can contain document.write calls, browsers can't continue to render the rest of the page until the JS is downloaded and executed. This is not the case for scripts with the `defer` attribute, as I suggested, but that does look like a very good reason not to use a manual DOMContentLoaded wrapper in a script in the `head`. Blocking is terrible. My lesson learned here is to always use `defer` rather than a load / DOMContentLoaded listener, does that sound OK?
:id:”WhatEverHere” Add to your tr tag inside your loop 
can't you do this ? &lt;tr v-for="(coin, index) in coins" :id="index"&gt;
Yeah, I've done a pretty sizable amount of ruby/rails dev, and its a slog chasing things through some of the large codebases (rails itself especially). So, so, so many layers to go through before you finally reach the code that is actually doing some shit you care about.
https://developers.google.com/chart/ is one option, you can google others too
Look at D3js. 
I was using google charts, on googling I found some other libraries as well, is there any way, I can define graphs without using pre-defined graph libraries ? For more customization, I can color my axes, define my own axes, set scales, etc. However I came across webGL, haven't used it before, will this be helpful and any other options ?
Without libraries, the way to do it manually would probably be with SVG or Canvas, but it will probably be pretty tedious. (I know, I've done it too)
Ok, I will try. Thank you.
Some more advise, try to focus less on learning new frameworks until you have an intimate working knowledge of vanilla JavaScript. Make sure to check out the event loop. Ohh and the debugger, get used to it. Lastly do yourself and your team a favor ans read Clean Code by your new uncle Bob
Super neat, had fun browsing the source. I like the way you annotated the expected type transformations (I doubt this is the proper term for it) in your functions.
You should be fine. In my experience, not much changes from one version to the next. At one point, I had to do a little refactoring but nothing to major. Look at Mike Bostock’s Blocks and pick up Scott Murray’s Interactive Data Visualization, which teaches you the basic of D3js. 
Any decent IDE worth its salt will have these features.
Thank you, I will look at example and try it out.
Even though I'm looking for someone with more experience to mentor me, I would also like to work with someone with less experience and get an opportunity to help a fellow developer. Let me know if you want to chat or something. 
&gt;I went fully down the "ducks" pattern of code organization before I realized this myself. What is your strategy for organizing redux apps in a "post-ducks" world? I'm still on ducks but they get pretty huge and occasionally unwieldy, especially when Typescript is involved.
What's the point of only doing fetch in a worker? Have you benchmarked a bog standard fetch vs comlink? From previous experience, my hunch is that the regular one would be faster on every metric...
I haven’t settled on anything other than splitting the ducks into two to keep actions and actions creators in one file and reducers and selectors in the other. I keep those under a state folder, separate from components. Pretty basic really, I’m not super happy with organization in my redux projects, always looking for suggestions.
That was pretty cool. But the syntax highlighting is not a function of TS, it's a function of the editor/IDE. Anyone know what this one was? 
can you tell me if this kind of JS: https://github.com/rdollent/todolist/blob/master/public/scripts/todoCalendar_mod.js can pass for a junior dev position? here is a working unfinished version and only works in a mobile window for now: rdollent-todo.herokuapp.com

You realize that things like different types in arrays mess alot with javascript performance? Based on your last sentencr you might need to do some research on that topic ;)
What are you using for side effects? Are you a "everything goes in redux" dev or do you keep a lot of stuff in local component state too? I also am itching for some better code organization but to be honest I've been trying to scratch that itch for my entire career. Every project eventually feels overwhelming. 
How, exactly? Please be precise. As far as I can tell this just adds and removes classnames depending on the scroll position relative to the current viewport. This doesn't make it any less accessible than it already is.
Thank you so much! :)
Neither does React, but both do if you care about project structure and taking advantage of modern features.
Overall, I like this article. It talks about laziness in a very easy to understand way (assuming you already know map/filter/etc) One thing to note though, is that you don't want to necessarily write lazy code if all you're going to be doing is calling `.take` in the same statement. Lazy code is quite a bit slower than eager code in JS, so the only time you'll want to write lazy code is if the rest of algorithm is outside of current scope, for example: // utils.js export const toLazy = array =&gt; new Lazy((function*() {for (const i of array) yield i})()) // loud.js const namesOf = (people) =&gt; people.map(p =&gt; p.name) const shout = (strings) =&gt; strings.map(s =&gt; s.toUpperCase()) const compose = (a, b) =&gt; c =&gt; b(a(c)) export const shoutNames = compose(namesOf, shout) export const loudNames = () =&gt; fetch('/api/users') .then(r =&gt; r.json()) .then(toLazy) .then(shoutNames) // my-app.js import {loudNames} from 'loud.js' async function run() { console.log(...(await loudNames()).take(3)) } run()
In a explicitly-typed language like Java, it can be easy for the IDE to find references to symbols accurately. But in JavaScript, if you're not using some type annotation system to help it out, the IDE might not be able to tell what type a value has, so if you try to find references to some member function, it may miss some references.
I asked what the drawbacks are though, not what the benefits are
I’m a put the state where it’s most suited dev. Root state and state for intra-component communication in redux, transient render state in React component state. For side effects I’m using middleware, avoiding thunks for async work.
When I select a date, nothing happens. Is that a bug?
I think this is what vscode uses
You are setting the `img` element’s position to `absolute`, which breaks the element out of its container. In order for the image to scale according to its container, remove the `absolute` positioning.
How is this different from above?
Some would argue that CoffeeScript increases readability of code with indentation syntax but each to their own.
vscode has go to definition. I'm sure most IDEs has this feature, in fact. It's one of the main reasons I use vscode over something like vim.
okay, thank you 
Enable moduleScripts in firefox in about:config dom.moduleScripts.enable 
As long as the parent has relative positioning it’s fine. I don’t think you should be giving css advice if you don’t know anything about it. 
Looks like your HTML attribute is incorrect. Instead of className=“” on your div, use class=“”.
[removed]
The definition of a method or function may not be the implementation 
As long as he’s using JSX its fine. JSX uses the `className` attribute instead of `class` because of the JavaScript keyword conflict. I don’t think you should be giving advice on JSX if you don’t know anything about it.
My most used shortcut is reformat code. 
I don’t know anything about it. You’re right. But I know about css, and your answer was completely wrong. OP: there’s better subs to post questions about css, you might get some better answers there. 
not in C
So if you really want to name your function `handle` or `process` or so, _always_ make sure you append a six-digit random number to the end to make it searchable.
Factually wrong. Languages such as C and C++ allow you to declare a function before implementing it. Rust allows you to declare traits before implementing them. Java allows for interfaces and abstract classes, each of which declare an interface without implementing it. 
&gt; In those languages, classes are objects But not all objects can be "classes".
Thanks!
Massive looks nice! My main reservation would be that it does not appear to be that widely used yet, and it doesn't appear to be used with TypeScript that often either. Do you have any idea how old the project is?
How far is so far? :)
Sad how the cool projects using this all died soon. Like https://github.com/phoboslab/jsmpeg-vnc was really cool and now it is abandoned.
_Use the axe Luke_ &gt; git log -p -S "some snippet of code" Also narrow by directory with `--`
You underestimate my "undo" and "re-undo" shortcuts :D I even customize my PHPStorm so it will: - CTRL+Z / Y (undo and re-undo) - CTRL+C / V (copy and paste) - CTRL+D / K (copy / remove whole current line) - CTRL+SHIFT+T (Open recent closed tab) - CTRL+(ALT+)Tab (Move one Tab to the right/left like in the browser) - CTRL+(SHIFT+)F (Search in current/all files) - CTRL+H (Search and Replace) - CTRL+E (Show last opened files) There are so many other shortcuts that I don't use.. I see some of them getting used by other employees and I am like "I need that too!". I have a mate who does everything per hand.. when he watches me how I do the same thing much faster with hundreds of shortcuts, he is like "holy... dude, you are the shortcut god". I love/hate to be lazy :-)
They say that you shouldn't feed the trolls, but I think that this is horrible. Here take some on my bill: https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IlMZfhdbUac/hqdefault.jpg
Well with `import` syntax, it is not always the case. That's also the main benefit behind typescript. Maintaining a nice clean codebase in javascript is really hard and when you fail at that... You can always search in all files :) Protip : https://blog.neufund.org/why-we-have-banned-default-exports-and-you-should-do-the-same-d51fdc2cf2ad
It's not like you will do +"15", or +(var) || 0 etc. all the time. But when you need, makes your life way easier. And, Object.prototype.valueOf, It's a bliss. Here is the problem, if you are meticulous and obsessive, it is completely possible to avoid type conversion. If you don't care, it is also completely possible to execute your script without bumping into any hurdles. I dealt with perl for years before I started working with js, way before es6, es5. And I did not bring my conventions, opinions and things I got used to from Perl to Js. I just sat down, studied, embraced and got used to taking advantage of the quirks. That's my personal choice. But I do not go around and say "Hey I have this, it's js with superpowers etc". 
What's hard to read here: "You are " + !!~"-1" 
We are in /r/javascript
it complements puppeteer avoiding repetitive code for do the same all the time. https://browserless.js.org/#/?id=faq
Or git grep Set up bash aliases for common search types. For example when working with php I have the letter f aliased to ‘git grep function $1(’ and a similar one for classes.
And I have to agree with this :) There's absolutely nothing wrong with a querybuilder, or even native wrapper, library and the battle tested repository pattern. ORM's are great tools but require some investment, they might be a wonderful tool to add if you're already heavily invested in a stack. But if you want less cognitive load, I'd say KISS.
What did you do to your linter? I just tried it, I have a fairly basic setup, and nothing is complaining about having a constant named "db." So, you're complaining about TSLint, not TypeScript (not even same company), and actually about _your_ configuration of TSLint. 
I'm not a fan of the CoffeeScript syntax myself, but as you said, to each their own. CoffeeScript might increase the readability, but it won't increase the information you get out of the code (especially when working on writing new code). Getting feedback on the properties/methods available for any given variable is where the use of TS becomes an advantage over CS.
And the bookmarks !
ripgrep is way faster than ag. 
In JS generally there is no difference. In typed languages (including typed supersets of JS like typescript) there can be a difference as something is declared in one place and defined elsewhere - think header files in C/C++ if you've every programmed in such languages. Even in plain JS an IDE could be able to do some basic code analysis to make a guess. If a variable is always assigned to via an object constructor it could know to take you to the code for that constructor when you ask it to take you to the implementation, where goto definition would take you to the relevant var/let/const line.
Ok so i have narrowed the problem down to the following code: if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN'])) { // same-origin requests won't set an origin. If the origin is set, it must be valid. if (in_array($_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN'], $accepted_origins)) { header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: ' . $_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN']); } else { header("HTTP/1.1 403 Origin Denied"); return; } } in the upload.php file.
Which of them do you mean? As far as I can see the confetti and pie charts are in the 2d context. Maybe I see more after I eat something.
Search all is also good for refactoring. It's not just used to figure out straight up spaghetti.
I'd say go to declaration is my most used IDE "shortcut". A signature is nice to see in the IDE but the actual method and comments around it have a lot of value.
Or ctrl + alt and click. 
the first thing that appears in the page is the iPhone X 3d model
My Simple movie search app with Vanilla js using OMDb api. https://github.com/manikandanraji/MovieDB
Ok got a work around now: $origin = parse_url($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'],PHP_URL_HOST); if (isset($origin)) { // same-origin requests won't set an origin. If the origin is set, it must be valid. if (in_array($origin, $accepted_origins)) { header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: ' . $origin; } else { header("HTTP/1.1 403 Origin Denied"); return; } }
`defer`is faster; it allows the browser to fetch the script and parse the document in parallel instead of sequantially parsing then fetching (and then waiting). Time spent parsing the document is usually completely unnoticeable, though.
Always prepare a JSFiddle to demonstrate your problem so it's a easier thing to look for. JSFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/qvjh5ugy/ If you change the width of the grid or the browser, the image is scaling up and down (I didn't changed anything), so it should work correctly. However I think that one parent element is having a fixed width, so the image stays at it's values. Can you check that?

Breaking it down, it does this: (+str) converts str to a Number, toString(16) converts it to base 16 (HEX), and toUpperCase() does exactly what it's name suggests.
Yes, ag is great. I think it builds a temporary index somewhere, cold searches can sometimes take a while but then it's very speedy. Btw my one gripe is that sometimes it hits a minified file and dumps out a long result that takes up the whole screen, anyone know a way to make it truncate long lines?
I use the command line all the time. I picked up the Linux Command Line Bible. Since then, I’ve made simple scripts to automate my Webpack config and directory structure setup. Now anytime I want to start a React project, I open up my terminal, call my script, and within minutes I have a react project setup. I also made the switch from Sublime to Neovim, which has been awesome. Getting started with vim is slow at first. But after a few weeks of reading through the docs and configuring vim, I’m so much more productive than I was with Sublime. So yeah I’m always using my terminal. Shell scripting is dope. It makes my life easier. 
Use a file watcher. Ex: webpack --watch Or use webpack-dev-server and it will even reload the page in the browser when you make changes, which will make it even faster than when you were first doing dev.
With many SASS implementations, there's a `-watch` flag you can pass to have it update your `.css` files automatically when you update any of the source `.sass` or `.scss` files. With Webpack, you can use something like [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) that will also automatically update your output when you update your input, and it'll even refresh your browser for you. To answer your question: it's completely normal to have your command line open constantly while developing, because it has to be open for these processes to run albeit your command line stays minimized mostly. :)
We have a model called map. Attempting to find all uses of that one can get painful. 
Before moving to redux, I had a roll-my-own state management that kind of ended up being 'accidental-flux-lite', but based on a pub/sub channel idea. It worked well, until it didn't - then it got messy. I was also exploring other flux patterns / implementations at the time on side projects - and while conceptually I liked them, something about them bugged me. Then a coworker was all "Hey, did you hear about redux?" - had only been out for a month or two at the time, pointed me at Dan Abramovs talk, and it just clicked. For simple state management needs - pub/sub can be great. And yeah, you might not need redux - I also think people take redux too far - local component state can be ok, the hoops I see some projects go through to 'redux all the things' for no real value can be a bit of a head scratcher. At a recent Vue meetup in Toronto, Hassan gave a talk on Vuex - but before going into Vuex, he does a quick overview of the ways people try and manage state / pub sub / etc - and the pain points you hit along the way. I think he does an excellent job at breaking it down - and even if you are not using Vue, Vuex, or Redux - it's worth watching. [Video is here](https://youtu.be/0SfHFjIiiwA?t=1h6m51s) -- started it at his talk time. 
Ramdajs is more like pure functional style than Lodash/FP in my opinion. Like Peter said, curried Ramda functions allows partial applications and always last data embraces implicit invocation (not sure if it is the term `f(x) when x is a function with one param`.
https://simonsmith.io/dipping-a-toe-into-functional-js-with-lodash-fp/ Disclaimer: It's my article
To be clear you're transferring to a functional programming *style*. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twwSstZlMRE
Will try --watch and look into webpack-dev-server. Thanks!
If you want to learn it in a concrete and applied way, try building an app with Redux. It'll get you used to immutability, partial application, function signatures, functions as parameters, etc.
So it's essentially doing a math operation with the number using base 16?
Michael Fogus's Functional Javascript is a fantastic book about functional programming in general, and explains the concepts using javascript in all of the examples.
You *could*, which is great, but it's more of a last resort for legacy projects (I've done this for an old Django project and some WordPress themes that require "FTP deployments"). Unfortunately, this comes at the expense of download size, initialization time, and performance since it has to basically do the compilation/build step on the client side every page load. IMO, the real power of Vue shines once you start using `.vue` files.
Yes! As some one about to graduate, I just discovered grep and it is incredible. I just wish that I could manipulate storage better, like pipe grep to the mv or cp commands easier... probably a way, I'm just a noob and haven't looked hard enough.
I like lemons. We’re both wrong. Problem solved. 
No, it only does what the original answer is saying, nothing else.
Thanks. 
In what way does it not play nicely with Webpack? I've never had any trouble with it and ts-loader. 
Hmm thank you for that. I'll read up more on this (I'm technically a noob) and try to optimize the code to handle errors using JS error classes/objects.
Really learning what map, filter, and reduce are for and then learning and using ramda are what really got me going with fp in JavaScript.

No. Lets say you got "12225" which is a string. It's turned into a number 12225. Its then converted to Hex, which is 2fc1. 2fc1 in upper case is 2FC1.
How do you spit the ducks ? Do you have an example ?
It's not a redux replacement...
wow that link is rly crap lmao
Sounds like we're more or less on the same path, except I'm still using thunk. I've used saga a bit but didn't really like how it meant you couldn't await your actions in your components (i.e. to close a modal after a record is successfully saved.) Maybe I didn't use it right but it felt like I either had to keep everything in redux (which I don't like doing) or rely heavily on componentWillReceiveProps to watch for specific changes (which I don't like doing). I've heard other people talking about using custom middleware to avoid thunks as well but I've never seen any examples, would you mind sharing? 
Why do you want to do that?
Lodash is amazing. It's simple, it's functional. It's the missing JavaScript standard library in my opinion. And given it's unobtrusiveness I don't see a downside of pulling it into every project.
"Javascript allongé" is a good start. https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix/read#leanpub-auto-about-javascript-allong "Mostly adequate guide to functional programming" is top notch.
The FP part of lodash has argument in the FP order as well. Ramda goes further in the FP paradigm. I promoted lodash/fp at work because lodash is almost a standard in the JS industry, but I would take ramda for personal projects to explore deeper.
use `ag -W [number of lines to truncate]`
Good job!
Hm, interesting. I generally prefer to achieve responsiveness only through css but I guess I’ve never needed different js functionality based on platform.
Once WebAssembly it's mobile phones we'll be able to ship React Native apps with Native code, imagine that!

Depending on your backend language, I'd be pretty surprised if there wasn't a tool to convert the strongly typed backend objects your are serialising for the wire, into a TS interface. .NET has a couple, and they are super handy. Hopefully can go a step closer to 0 runtime errors, although, it may be a lot of effort to stop those 5!
I have found a lot of really great help in learning FP from a JavaScript background with Kyle Simpson’s “functional-light JavaScript ” [link](https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS)
You can use regular *.js files with jsdoc comments, and the typescript compiler with typecheck your code like it does in *.ts files.
That was fun, thanks.

If you don't want to dedicate a terminal to manually manage compilation scripts, you may want to consider running watch processes in the background.
I bought it and enjoyed the few hours I put on it, it's a really nice game but I don't know how it has evolved since, you can try it for free

It’d be nice if you could pass a parameter to provide your own path. I for one would not save my screenshots on my desktop
I'll implement this soon. Thank for the suggestion!
You forgot to link your code. Btw unstated is like a fresh air. Redux made a religion out of handling state. After switching some projects to unstated, I feel liberated.
Excellent. Thank you!
One possibility could be to look into functional languages which compile into JavaScript. Examples are [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) - which is limited to web front ends - and [Clojure(Script)](https://clojurescript.org).
My rubric for what should be tested and what shouldn't: * Do I care about the return value? If so, test it. * Do I care about the errors it could throw? If so, test it. * Does another piece of my codebase depend on this? If so, test every possible outcome that might affect the other pieces In your code above, I would test 1) that it handles 200 requests _correctly_, whatever that means in your use case, 2) it handles 400/500 requests correctly, and 3) that it handles any errors like bad inputs correctly. Once you know that these three things are handled, you should be able to treat these as black boxes and know that the black box does what it says it does correctly.
even `alias g="./* -re "`
Learn Cycle.js and RxJS (or a reactive library). You'll have a framework for building apps instead of just using lodash/ramda which is just a functional utility library.
Wow! Very cool! Now it would be awesome to have a git GUI that does exactly the same thing!
Others have linked to a lot of good resources, but I just want to call out one of the most important aspects of functional programming: the concept of a *pure function*. A function is said to be pure when its return value is *only* determined by its inputs. It doesn't rely on external state or data that is scoped outside of the function. No references to `this` or `window` or closure. Same data in, same result out. Every time. Not only does a pure function not rely on externally scoped state, it doesn't modify that state either. It literally only returns a value. This makes it referentially transparent: that is, it doesn't cause hidden side effects. This makes functions that are 100% dead simple to reason about, and test. You can go a step further and combine that with the Law of Demeter, which says to pass in *only* the exact data that a function needs. Don't pass in an object, because then the function needs to know what the shape of that object is and what properties to reference. Instead, try to pass in only the exact *scalar* values that you need - numbers, strings etc. Now, function purity and passing in only simple scalar values is not possible 100% of the time. At some point you need to make network calls, or render something, or update/mutate an object or what have you. That's fine to do that when needed. But a primary goal of functional programming is to do that *only* when needed, and to be very conscientious about favoring pure functions with simple inputs as often as possible. And note that this way of thinking doesn't just help FP. It make OO code way easier to reason about as well. Writing methods that take their dependencies as inputs rather than as object state makes them way easier to grok (that said, truly *good* OO design solves that problem in a different way). 
sorry i was doing work on it. you can try now and see how it is.
&gt; On the EJS files, 90% will be the same HTML code for each EJS file, the 10% will be dynamic (let's say &lt;p&gt; forum creators username &lt;/p&gt;). The reason I'm having a hard time answering is because this is exactly what EJS and any other server side template already does.. I think that the piece you might be missing is that you need a database to get/save the user's data. If you have a more specific question we might be able to help more.
yeah no, i wouldnt rely on that, good guy but there's some mistakes in his content.
Never heard of it... will check it out... thanks!
Maybe frameworks are like a dialect of the language. If two people speak the same language and the same dialect, then they can communicate well. If you don't speak the dialect, then you're going to understand most of it.. but also miss some things. BOOM. Analogy.
It was so silly of me to forget to link the repo. EXACTLY!!! Can not agree with you more. 
Why not? https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf
That would be a reason - because you heard that it was better. Or something like that. The first question should always be, "why do you want to do that?" If there's no real answer, you may be searching for a solution to a problem you don't have.

If programming for you is cranking out a lot of code and reinventing the wheel all the time, yes, then frameworks are anti-programming. Personally, programming for me is building products for users. Frameworks help immensely building products in a timely fashion as there are a lot of things already solved and don't have to be implemented by me or my team. I don't want to build my own rendering layer or request library for every project. There is almost never a point in building your own authentication and authorization library, no point in writing your own template language. Frameworks solve a lot of problems I don't want to deal with when building products. If I want to go low-level and deal with those things, I will contribute to the frameworks or libraries myself.
The routed modal approach actually works pretty well here since the post-save action wouldn't redirect forwards but instead could just do a "back" action to whatever launched it.
Oh, hey that's pretty clever. I've always really liked being able to link directly to modals too. So are you using react-router-redux then? And where do you draw the line of responsibility between sagas and your custom middleware? Also thanks for sharing all this knowledge with me and feel free to stop answering any time :)
So.. you can not use uglifyJs?
I agree, JavaScript allonge is a good functional style js book. Take your time and digest each concept. It will slowly make sense 
All functional programming means is programming without side effects. Do yourself a favor. Put away all the libraries and tutorials. Write some simple applications with map, filter, and reduce. No side effects, no internal state, no for loops. Once you're done you'll realize "oh, I already was a functional programmer; I just needed to stop using certain things."
I think the difference is now() is a class method and getDate() is an instance method Am I right?
I'll be doing a live stream here in about 2 hrs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpG1Wzn5by8. The tutorial covers contenteditable and the range APIs.
The new hotness is call bags, which sounds like ballbags but is actually intriguingly cool. You'll have a ball!

Hi /u/luhegha4, this post was removed. Please see our rules, and do know that 'Java' !== 'JavaScript'.
Install cargo once and you can use it instead of package managers for Rust utilities (of which there are quite a few now). A bonus is that it's always up-to-date with the source and doesn't require root to install. I try to use npm/cargo and avoid global packages whenever I can. 
`rg something` (ripgrep. Way faster and way more powerful) 
This is a horribly written article and is completely wrong. Please remove this submission. Dan didn't announce a replacement for Redux in any way. Dan demoed upcoming capabilities of React related to async rendering. The linked tweet from Kent Dodds is a joke, and was written in a joke "live commenting on the talk" Twitter thread.
Oh what about those fun times when you dynamically created large swaths of variables globally, so even doing a text search yields nothing because it's really handled with `method_missing` or some other magic? Ruby, man. It's actually my favorite language. To paraphrase and generalize Gary Bernhardt, "Ruby is awesome. But if you actually use it: wat?" 
This is just lazy. Don't make a friggin' shortcut for it. Make it happen automatically when you save.
You'll have to add the images to the DOM anyway, so why not add a className or id to the image container, and reference that in the css?
Cool game. Made me realize how much I suck at programming. Worth it.
Instead of tests, I like to think of them as specification. Like “how should this unit behave, if I were to think of every cornercase”
One simple rule that answers this question and has really improved the quality of my unit tests in the past couple years: Don't test private methods. I'm other words, test your public APIs. If your code has side effects (DOM mutations, other module.foo() was called with XYZ, etc), test that the side effects happen. There are exceptions of course, but they are rare. 
Human Resource Machine did this to me. 
Thanks! That isn't in the man page... but it is in `ag --help`.
Lol people downvoting this because this sub is full of people with ZERO understanding of computer science. THIS GUY IS CORRECT. FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING IS JUST A STYLE/CONCEPT.
If you use background-image instead of IMG tags it'd be a whole lot simpler. You could just add a css transition to the element that has its background-image swapped out
No they are both pointing to a Date Object that holds those methods. By default JavaScript goes up the prototype chain until it finds the method you called. Prototype acts like a delegate since there aren’t really classes like traditional programming languages. If you wanna know more look up fun fun functions on youtube he has a great series on classes in JavaScript. 
I suggest you first read through this series of articles by Eric Elliott on functional programming and compositional software techniques in JavaScript ES6+ from the ground up, starting with: https://medium.com/javascript-scene/composing-software-an-introduction-27b72500d6ea It is very thorough and helpful for all skill levels. As phpdevster pointed out, Pure functions are a pillar of FP. However, as Eric detailed, there are several other pillars: " First class functions: The ability to use functions as data values: pass functions as arguments, return functions, and assign functions to variables and object properties... Anonymous functions and concise lambda syntax (e.g. arrow functions)... Closures: ...When a function is defined inside another function, it has access to the variable bindings in the outer function, even after the outer function exits... [and these, which JavaScript doesn't strictly have or enforce]: Purity: ... Expressions with side-effects are not allowed. Immutability: ...Instead of mutating an existing data structure, such as an array or object, expressions evaluate to new data structures. This may sound inefficient, but most functional languages use trie data structures under the hood, which feature structural sharing: meaning that the old object and new object share references to the data that is the same. [check out Immutable.js for efficient immutable data structures] Recursion: Recursion is the ability for a function to reference itself for the purpose of iteration. " I also recommend looking into something like deep freeze https://github.com/substack/deep-freeze which enables immutable objects, although immutable.js may make more sense. --- So, in my opinion you should first nail these four concepts, and then move onto the other stuff: 1. First-class functions (functions can be treated like any other value, and passed into and returned from functions, e.g. callbacks). 2. Pure functions, described nicely by phpdevster (pure functions always return the same output given the same input; only internal variables are used, no need to worry about side-effects caused outside of the function). 3. Immutability (when processing data such as an array, return a new array rather than mutating the input array, e.g. filter, map). 4. Closures (A function inside a function still has access to the lexical environment (e.g. variables, data) of the outer function, even after the outer function has exited). --- Then there are things like filter, map, and reduce. These loop over a functor (e.g. an array), allowing you to do some processing with each item, returning a new array based on the input array. These methods are likely be become useful to you. This is nicer than using a for(i=0;i&lt;len;i++) loop. --- I'm still learning too, FP just feels right - it feels like the right way to do things, abstractifying away the lower level parts of the code, keeping it DRY, allowing you to solve higher level problems faster. Good luck, have fun.
You can have multiple background images but you can't fade between them. You need to fake it by fading between two divs 
haha ok. Sorry, I've only used UlgifyJS with webpack. Don't think i've ever seen any commercial alternatives. 
Yes. As class methods, those functions are not tied to a specific Date instance state (now() is a little special in that it uses what a new, at the time of call, Date would have for its state - basically being a shortcut to new Date().getTime()). Instance methods are specific to the date instance they're called from. getDate(), for example could have different values depending on which instance its called from since Date instances can each reference different dates in time.
from a basic standpoint yes, but functional programming is not just pure functions + map/filter/reduce 
The others already answered your question, but personally I like to not use any non-package types within my interfaces, including primitive types. This forces me to think in a very much non-reducable, abstract language, that is specific to that use case. I like to use types to describe the data stored there as best as possible, for example a descriptive text that is displayed as HTML would at least get a type like `HtmlText`, which would extend `string`. If it's a comment of some sort, it'd become a `CommentHtmlText` or similiar. This might look like extra work in some cases and it's not always necessary, but it can be a very nice tool. Also, some type systems will forbid the mixed usage of two types of similiar inheritence. Even if `Seconds = number` and `Minutes = number` are both numbers, the type system would disallow you to use a Seconds value implicitly as Minutes and would at least require a cast to `number` for it to work. I think this is how Haskell does it, but TypeScript seems to only be interested in the primitive type: `var minutes:Minutes = &lt;Seconds&gt;seconds` seems to work there without error. Never the less, referencing significant types locally in your modules helps design and build your data structure.
Hi. I personally in favour of TDD, first I think what I want, then I write test description, test expectation, preconditions, execution. It helps me focus on result and omit many unexpected defects. I've written a lot of tests with TDD and think that is the best way to code, unless your requirements change rapidly.
French video but still it is really nice : https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1kDpGeoCk
because that is not at all the same as using new, by using Object.create(Date) you are just making a new instance of the Date object that is not a constructor, its not actually a date.
This is very cool! I'm going to share this with peers to help illustrate how git flow is supposed to work. Thanks for sharing.
Emacs/vim both do support this functionality, usually through a tags database. This isn't always great on languishes like Java and C++, but generally works fine everywhere else.
We've been using it for about a year . The newest version has full promise support, so that should speak to something that the maintainer(s) has fully refactored it to keep up with current trends. 
Ah, very cool. I had a look at redux-first-router a while back, it seems like an interesting project as well. It's funny if you follow react people on twitter, it seems like everyone (even Dan) is ragging on redux all the time. I dunno, I still like it.
no, it isn't. it's in fact just purity. it doesn't even need functions. map/filter/reduce are just the easy way to get used to it in javascript in my opinion.
Absolutely! It does take some setup though, as is often the case with vim/emacs - time which I would spend earlier in my career. But for the same reason I've transitioned from arch to ubuntu I have transitioned from vim to vscode with a vim plugin: I no longer want to spend the time it takes to make either alternative better than those that are pretty good right out of the box.
https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS
I've done similar from emacs -&gt; spacemacs. I like the emacs system and love being able to add a small thing when I need it, but I don't want to maintain menus for various features or making sure plugin compatibility works, so spacemacs handles 98% of my config, then I add to it as needed.
&gt; https://simonsmith.io/dipping-a-toe-into-functional-js-with-lodash-fp/ woah this is weird, but I've been spending a not-so-insignificant amount of time customizing and hacking away at my frankenstein dotfiles which was cobbled after many years of finding old blog posts fixing some relevant config setting at the time... After falling down a deep deep rabbit hole of various dotfiles, yours was a godsend. Still have to learn `chunkwm` and get some portions of the `vimrc` to load properly, but god damn your dotfiles brought hope in a time of deep dotfile darkness. Thank you. 
the new object it creates is just the Date.constructor that hasn't been called since new does that for you.
&gt;see where that goes? Sure, just open up your Network tab in dev tools
If it’s an &lt;img &gt; inserted into the DOM you can still mess around with it’s style (opacity I believe) by writing to its style parameters using JS. 
It's in the Sources -&gt; Network tab
I love it, Do you have any example of Dan ragging on Redux? I usually see him commenting that people are miss-using it or using it for things that are too simple where it doesn't add value.
Do you have an example of how you can use map/filter/reduce without side effects, without functions because i'm curious as to how a higher order function can do anything without valid inputs. If we are talking purity here then you need functions. you also need recursion and you need a way of actually doing i/o from your pure code which is typically done through monads. The alternative is just a bunch of code that does nothing.
yes and programming without side effects take understanding more than just what pure functions are and map/filter/reduce your example of forEach has side effects, it's not pure unless you are using it to do nothing. In addition to that you can create impure usages of map/filter/reduce they aren't guaranteed to be pure.
Any reason to use a Subject instead of just a public property and reading from that?
Thanks. I'm in there now looking. Not sure where to go from here to see the expression that calculates it.
Honestly, if you're looking at a function and think "...Christ, how do I test this", then you need to break out your function into smaller units. Instead of performing error handling, 3rd party ajax calls (axios), headers, etc, all in one function, break that out. Unless your app is really small and this one of the few ajax calls you'll be making.
https://github.com/quicktype/quicktype
This is absolutely what I've been needing. Been pushing hard to make git flow our standard and having to explain over and over and drawing it out is tedious at best. Great work!
It dispatches a CustomEvent called "lpsubmit" when you click the button. This event isn't being handled in any JavaScript that I can see, so I can only guess that it's being handled by server-side PHP code. That would be confirmed by the page reloading when you click the button. If the calculation was being done in client-side JavaScript, it wouldn't need to reload. There's no way to view the server-side code, sorry.
Yeah, I wouldn't say he "rags" on it, but he's certainly spent more time trying to tell people to _not_ use it than he has actually promoting its use. Admittedly, he never set out to write something that would take over the world of state management in the first place. Sure, he wanted people to use it, but Redux really was something of a "conference demo" that got a lot of attention and became way more popular than he'd ever anticipated. From there, people began misusing it, then people complained about it, etc, etc. So, I think he's actually kind of defensive about it at this point, both because he never tried to push it as an all-encompassing solution in the first place, and because he's also a core React team member who sees how React can handle a lot of those use cases by itself. (I say all this as a Redux maintainer, and based on stuff I've seen Dan say and some of the conversations I've had with him myself.)
thanks.
Awh shucks. :( Thanks tho.

lodash/FP is fairly limited when it comes to FP. would recommend ramda.
/u/acemarke Put it much better than I could have. 
Wow, awesome advice too. Thanks!
There are a load of people in here saying functional programming is programming without side effects which is sort of true BUT you can't interact with any outside services without side effects. I would say it's mostly programming without side effects but when you have to you do so in a safe manner using for example a maybe monad. I can really recommend this [book](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-javascript). It has some nice examples of how you can safely handle side effects and a ton of other functional programming concepts.
How would I get the background-image to transition through a timer then and be the same size as the canvas we are using? 
Learning functional programming from JavaScript is a bit like learning to drive in a three wheeled car. You'll get there eventually, but everything would have made more sense along the way if you'd started with four wheels. Learn a language that was designed to be functional first. Take a look at Elm, or Clojure, or Haskell, or Scala, or Ocaml, or F#. I found Clojure to be the smallest step from JavaScript, but Elm's also done a lot of work to be approachable for programmers coming from non-functional backgrounds. Once it starts to change the way you think, you'll find ways to translate those ideas into JavaScript and that's when you'll notice it really start to improve your code.

What do you mean? You want a guide on how to build an app from the ground up e.g. set up the project from scratch?
Thanks for sharing, it was pretty insightful.
I will. I'm just wondering which one will get me a job faster. 
This is one of the best introductions to FP I have seen! 
This seems like a good application for localstorage. Might be worth checking out [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API)
I played it a little. The beginning is easy, you mine energy, build, and maintain your buildings. Then the learning curve becomes very steep imho, where you need to build army, invading party, attack another room, and build stuff in that room. And if you are a "free" or a one-time buy player, then you have to go into the cpu optimalization very much, to be able manage multiple rooms.
Ah, if it's a canvas, that's another thing. One way would be to redraw the canvas each frame, with the image more and more transparent each time.
Definitely more for React. Both are good though. Angular is also in a bit of a state of flux since Angular 2 (or 4, whatever you want to call it) is an entirely new framework and many companies are still on the older version. But you can easily find a job with both. 
Angular is in a death spiral. It's becoming the COBOL of the JavaScript ecosystem. You can earn good money if you're an expert because it's too complicated and nobody new is learning it.
What are your reasons for wanting to learn functional programming?
Babylon.js would be more suitable. 
I'm interested in what your opinion is on Redux going forwards? My personal opinion is that some of the improvements to React such as the new context API etc solve some of the misuse of over use of redux, but I still wouldn't want to trade all my event sourced state for a React only solution. Some of the benefits I'd be loathe to give up would be observability of the action stream and the debugging benefits that brings, not to mention middleware. I also value Redux for inter-component communication, it's avoid having too many "god like" parent components orchestrating things, that really only need to watch the same area of the global state.
Vue.js is the easiest to learn, and is flourishing very well... besides that you only need to know about how components work and reactivity. Then you can pick any framework, they all follow a similar standard
[hacker news hiring trends](https://www.hntrends.com/2018/jan-react-continues-streak.html?compare1=React&amp;compare2=AngularJS&amp;compare3=Vue&amp;compare4=Ember) is one of my favorite resources. 
Learn react. I used react for years and now have to use angular and I have a lot of hate for it. React is a much better experience.
Antipattern is a pretty strong word. You have to explain yourself a bit more there.
I guess it depends on the industry and area. No one in my area is hiring for react. 
The writer doesn't seem to have quite the language skills required for precise technical explanations, unfortunately...
Depends on where you're at to be honest. If there's a lot of .NET shops around you'll probably see more Angular.
make a jsfiddle and show us was you have coded so far so we can point you in the right direction 
Nah, man. He edited his post while I was typing the comment. But sorry for that, anyway.
Nah, man. I had the page loaded with the previous, agglomarated text when I typed the comment. Only realised he'd changed the text when I submitted.
Hey I didn't get a good vibe from Eric and looks like some others didn't either, but I still think regardless of emotions, there is a lot you can learn from his articles. Yes, he is just 1 voice out of many, and it's up to us to learn from multiple sources, not just 1.
What are you having difficulty with? Can you provide an example? JSfiddle or Codepen?
Why is everything labeled "lightweight" these days?
Vue is probably the worst option for finding a job...
Aww, the humblebundle *just* ended
Essentially data first is just functionally backwards, and offers zero benefit and multiple detriments. Chain is a less efficient, less performant version of compose. There are other reasons, but I’m on mobile.

This is amazing!
Hi /u/illuminatiiiiii, For javascript help, please visit /r/LearnJavascript. Thank you!
For noobs' sake, perhaps tooltips to indicate what the letters stand for might help. Awesome work.
Angular attracts a lot of hate but it's solid to work with and employable. Obviously you can't go wrong with React either but I wouldn't easily disregard Angular.
&gt; Do you have an example of how you can use map/filter/reduce without side effects, without functions because i'm curious as to how a higher order function can do anything without valid inputs. what does being side effect free have to do with not having inputs? . &gt; If we are talking purity here then you need functions. um. no, you don't. lots of languages like smalltalk and ruby don't have functions, and there's no reason a language like that couldn't be pure. many logic programming languages are pure, yet do not have functions. same goes for some stack based languages, postscript 1 and 2 (display postscript and ps3 have functions,) several of the pure prolog and forth variants, state machine and automaton languages, CSS, several of the descent languages, math languages, most constraint languages, almost all logic languages, i think maybe all dataflow languages, et cetera . &gt; you also need recursion there is no need for recursion to have purity. all purity means is the absence of side effects. a pure language without recursion would, admittedly, be difficult to use, but as you may know, all recursion can be converted to imperative behavior, by definition . &gt; you need a way of actually doing i/o from your pure code CSS by example does no I/O of any kind . &gt; which is typically done through monads can you name a single language that isn't in the haskell family for which this is true? . &gt; The alternative is just a bunch of code that does nothing. several languages in heavy mainstream use stand as counterexamples to this claim please have a nice day
It's a bit easier to understand when just dealing with functions, rather than functions *and* modules at the same time. &gt;because it's been called outside it's lexical scope but it requires a variable that is inside it's lexical scope the JavaScript engine doesn't perform garbage collection on cubicWeights. It still allows getAllCubicWeights access to it thus creating a closure. A block always has access to variables in its outer blocks. So, for any reference to getAllCubicWeights (for example, as a module export, or if the function is passed as a parameter to some other function), code inside getAllCubicWeights will still always be able to see `cubicWeights`. It's not so much *because* `cubicWeights` is "required" by `getAllCubicWeights`, but because cubicWeights naturally remains in scope of `getAllCubicWeights`. Even without an explicit reference, the variable could still be accessed with eval, for example, because it's still in scope. (I think)

It will probably some plunker or stackblitz or something that already has some code in it along with a set of requirements. I assume youll sit with a developer that is more senior than you and you will work out a solution to something together. Don't worry about always knowing the answer. Be sure to talk through what you are thinking about. Start by explaining what you know about the code you're looking at and throw out a few potential ideas about ways you and s/he could attack the problem. The interviewer wants to find out how you approach a problem and the types of solutions you come up with. Try to act as though you and the interviewer are on the same team. That will put the interviewer at ease and help to put you at ease as well. I can't emphasize enough that you need to talk it out. The interviewer can't read your mind, so make sure you speak your mind. I've interviewed people before that got the wrong answers and said nothing and people that have gotten the wrong answer but showed that they took a well reasoned approach to solving the problem. The latter is really really helpful. When I interview people I honestly don't care if they have all the answers right now. I want to know that they have the capacity to find the answer when they are working on their own (or on a pair programming environment). Just relax, try to keep it light hearted, and show them what you're capable of. Try to crack a joke or two (non offensive of course) at the beginning or towards the end. Make them feel like you're a person they could see fitting in with the team. You got this!
Code reuse and abstraction (both of which are the points of frameworks) aren’t programming? Okay then.
&gt; what does being side effect free have to do with not having inputs? You can't have purity without inputs. not your lack of examples &gt; um. no, you don't. lots of languages like smalltalk and ruby don't have functions, and there's no reason a language like that couldn't be pure. ruby has functions and smalltalk is not an fp language. &gt; there is no need for recursion to have purity. all purity means is the absence of side effects. which is why you need recursion, show me an implementation of iteration that's pure and stateless without recursion. &gt; CSS by example does no I/O of any kind css isn't a programming language though. &gt; can you name a single language that isn't in the haskell family for which this is true? Can you give me a single example of software that's pure where this isn't true? &gt; several languages in heavy mainstream use stand as counterexamples to this claim There's 0 examples of programming languages that are 100% pure and stateless. 
Ah. I hadn't thought of that.
Same thing - `fn` is a reference to `inner` there, and `inner` can see `something` since it's in its scope. That exact pattern is a very common way to encapsulate data - expose an external method or two, while keeping internal data secret. https://jsfiddle.net/uqcnrd9p/ The internal data is *hidden*, but it still exists (won't get GC'd) as long as a reference exists to a function that has that internal data in its scope.
Maybe I do have some misunderstanding left. &amp;nbsp; I was of the understanding that when I'm calling `fn();` I'm basically calling `inner` at a global scope level and thus `something` isn't in it's scope. It's only usable because JavaScript makes it usable through a closure
&gt; You can't have purity without inputs. not your lack of examples Why not? A function that emits the squares of the integers 1-100 is pure. . &gt; ruby has functions matz doesn't think so, but ok . &gt; smalltalk is not an fp language. i didn't say it was, but ok . &gt; which is why you need recursion, show me an implementation of iteration that's pure and stateless without recursion. you seem very confused about what a side effect is nobody said it has to be stateless. it's perfectly fine for a pure function to be stateful. it just can't emit or retain state. . &gt; &gt; CSS by example does no I/O of any kind &gt; css isn't a programming language though. the entire field of programming language design disagrees with you, but ok . &gt; &gt; can you name a single language that isn't in the haskell family for which this is true? &gt; Can you give me a single example of software that's pure where this isn't true? translation: you can't answer my question, so try to get out of it with reddit judo . &gt; &gt; several languages in heavy mainstream use stand as counterexamples to this claim &gt; There's 0 examples of programming languages that are 100% pure and stateless. i didn't say anything about statelessness. you added that criterion from scratch. in the meantime, you're wrong about css being a programming language, and it's standing right in front of you. please have a nice day. i'm not really interested.
Right so it's not necessarily about getting the correct answer, more about how you think about the problem and approach it? I think what worries me the most is what you said about sitting there and just fumbling around and not being able to come up with anything and saying nothing!
Thanks for the comments, it's really making me think about this. You're right mostly but I think you're missing a part of the process, when `closure();` is called that scope should get trashed but it lives because `inner` has a closure over it. It's more than just scoping in this instance. [Kyle explains it better than I ever could in this article](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch5.md) in particular the second example under "Nitty Gritty"
General practice. A few good practices to follow 1. Use immutable objects where possible. 2. Ensure that you cannot create a malformed object. If you have a bunch of optional setters, it's game over. 3. Ensure the object validates its constructor arguments. 4. Keep the scope of the object small and any state it depends on, fully encapsulated. 5. If an object can be mutated, make sure mutations are not temporaly dependent (e.g. must call x.a('foo') before x.b('bar') - that's a recipe for disaster) 6. Make sure all mutations are fully encapsulated behind a contract. No direct property access. 7. Ideally, aim for a dichotomy of stateless objects (pure functionality), and objects with pure state that have a very specific responsibility. This keeps state isolated. 8. Stive to make sure all state is consolidated down to a single source of truth. The goal is not to let object state leak all over the place, because then side effects are going to bite you in the ass eventually. But it's really hard to design objects (abstractions) correctly, and it's very easy to create a stateful mess with OO. 
This is very exciting! Love what this team is doing. 
&gt; 'something' would normally no longer exist after this call in any sense, but it's kept around as a closure for inner Yup, you nailed closures perfectly.
Vue is more of a simple view model UI library than a full fledged framework. You pick Vue and Angular for different reasons. 
Works well on mobile, however, it requires a lot of side scrolling. Changing the orientation of the graph might suit a tall, narrow screen better from a UX perspective. Great work regardless.
Looks great. Any plans for rebase support?
Vue is nice, but I find the rigid structure of its Vue model to be quite limiting. Makes managing `this` really hard. Can't always use simpler ES6 fat arrow functions because of the different scoping rules etc. 
This is super helpful, thank you! The interview is tomorrow so I'm just going over some basic React material. It's a junior dev role. 
react is garbage.
&gt; Now because it's been called outside it's lexical scope but it requires a variable that is inside it's lexical scope the JavaScript engine doesn't perform garbage collection on cubicWeights. It still allows getAllCubicWeights access to it thus creating a closure. Yup, you got this right as well. Modules create a new lexical environment, just like a function or a block does, and functions defined inside that module keep a reference to that lexical environment.
I respect your opinion. Many people don't think that though: https://github.com/facebook/react (check out the star count) this was designed for people who use or want to use React
If it's a junior dev role, they most likely won't be looking for you to make big architectural decisions, they'll want someone comfortable making smaller changes who understands the basics of react and feels comfortable with JavaScript. If it's a big enough company, you may be able to get some insight into the interview process on glassdoor.com. You're gonna do great, dont stress over it.
react
Dude, one good advice I learned a long ago was to first look in your area what are the frameworks in demand... Perhaps in the Netherlands is React, maybe in San Francisco is Angular, whatever, who knows (lousy examples). My point is, don't just learn 'what's hot because I read it on reddit', learn what's hot in the area you actually want to work in
Dude, one good advice I learned a long ago was to first look in your area what are the frameworks in demand...

My point is, don't just learn 'what's hot because I read it on reddit', learn what's hot in the area you actually want to work in
I pair-program almost full time at my job, and at this point I have right around 10,000 hours of practice at it; here are my pointers: - *Talk.* Echoing /u/BrokenPhoneBooth, make sure you're thinking out loud. When you're driving, describe what you're about to do and why. When you're navigating, ask questions, make observations, propose ideas, and in general make sure your pair knows you haven't zoned out. One subtle trick while driving is to use your commentary to help your pair follow you as you move around the code base—it's really jarring when a pair switches files on you without telling you where you're going. So, as you're talking out loud, if you say "so we should add a test case back in WhateverComponentSpec", and *then* switch back to the WhateverComponentSpec file, it'll be easier for your pair to stay with you. - *Listen.* Pairing is a conversation, and when interviewers include a pair programming session, one of the things they want to see is how good you are at listening to other people. If your pair expresses concern about something, don't ignore them—take the time to find out why they're worried and talk through the implications. Pay close attention—when your pair explains something to you, try to apply what you've learned at the first opportunity, to prove that you're learning. - *Compromise.* It isn't useful pairing with someone who just blindly agrees with everything you say—you might as well work alone at that point. On the other hand, someone with "strong opinions strongly held" can paralyze or steamroll a pair. A common technique you'll need to reach for is "Well, I'm not entirely convinced by the approach you want to take, but it's at least reasonable—rather than continuing to discuss it in the abstract, let's start building it out. Then the pros and cons will become clearer, and maybe I'll find that I was wrong after all." - *Be kind.* Treat your pair as a human you respect, not as an opponent to score points on. Don't attach code or ideas to persons—don't take it personally if your pair points out weaknesses in an approach you proposed, and be sure to phrase criticisms of *their* ideas as criticisms of the ideas, not of them. Pay attention to your pair, and check in frequently to see if they'd like to be driving more, or driving less, or if they understand what you're talking about or what you're doing. 
Hi /u/the_argus, please refrain from personal attacks. Thanks.
I would definitely recommend porting your project to a framework asap. You’re project will become much more structured and easy to come back to after periods of time. I would suggest react or angular simply because they have more support and there are more jobs (if thats even in your mind). Good Luck
&gt; Yeah that's definitely true. It's kind of a pain to get up and running with React if you're on VS. 
Yeah their official docs are really good, you should have a grasp on node and npm before you dive into it but they make it pretty easy to get started. Once you have the basics of react you should look into redux aswell for more complicated app behaviour.
It’s like this was written by AI
I don't get it, I don't think they change.
I just scrolls out of view for me.
&gt; (note: header is fixed when width is &gt;1600px) (note: header is fixed when width is &gt;1600px)(note: header is fixed when width is &gt;1600px)(note: header is fixed when width is &gt;1600px)(note: header is fixed when width is &gt;1600px)(note: header is fixed when width is &gt;1600px)(note: header is fixed when width is &gt;1600px)(note: header is fixed when width is &gt;1600px)(note: header is fixed when width is &gt;1600px)(note: header is fixed when width is &gt;1600px)
idk man. i'm on a 15" mbp and maximized it. still just scrolls out of view for me.
The State of JS 2017 survey has some interesting data. This page has charts comparing developer salary and years of experience against the various libraries: https://stateofjs.com/2017/front-end/developers/ This page illustrates library usage world wide and per country: https://stateofjs.com/2017/front-end/worldwide/ I’d recommend browsing through the rest of the results, there’s some interesting stuff in there. 
so it goes like this: react and garbage......same thing.
This is really important. I did one interview where the guy was using Windows (everyone else in company had macs). It completely threw me off. 
I solved the issue, was a fail with my html and css positions and z-indexes. ``` @media only screen and (max-width: 1600px), only screen and (max-height: 800px) .header { min-height: 720px; position: relative; } ```
you don't need a reason to hate react. you can smell it from here.
you should change it to 900px
its way too complicated for me and it reminds me of this garbage framework we had at PayPal 15 years ago.
In my area it looks like companies are looking for react developers
Fair enough...I generally think its overkill for most CRUD type applications
lol, I did not make the site dude :) what's your resolution on ur macbook? So, I figured out why I had all the problems. I didn't place `position: relative` and didn't know `z-index` won't work on `non specified position`, the default `static`
If you have a realtime app use it if you like shoving pencils up your ass for fun.
i see.
That's just an opinion, I use Vue in production, I am a Vue developer and I've watched dozens of React Tutorials...and without write any code I understand exactly what to do. If you don't know JavaScript and you just learn a framework then you'll be heading to the wrong direction. At the end you're a JavaScript developer. The framework is just a tool
You initially have two branches. Master and develop. There can be three additional/side branches: Feature, Release and Hotfix. You can have as many of the side branches as you like. C = Commit new change H = Create a Hotfix branch and make a commit. F = Branch to a Feature branch and make a commit. X = Destroy the branch after it is used (Ideally, destruction is done automatically when a branch is merged to master or develop. [Automatically: the tool you are using can be integrated to be used with git scripts{scripts that contain multiple git commands like: " git checkout $develop git merge $feature_branch_name git branch -d $feature_branch_name "}]) M = Merge Branch (context of the merge changes based on which branch is to be merged. That's the hard part to grasp about the git flow. [This is the action that normally destroys the branch]) Development branch is where you actually develop your application. If a feature will have several commits or you wouldn't like to break development branch since you will also be using that for some testing/continous integration purposes, you develop features in their own branches. Hence, the "Feature" branch. When you are done with the development cycle and would like to push it to production, you create a release branch where you can have your UAT tests and deployments. Master branch is actually your production/deployment branch. It is called the "source of truth". There is always the possibility of bugs in the master/production branch even after UAT testing. You wouldn't want to get in on a deployment process(feature-&gt;development-&gt;release-&gt;testing-&gt;master) instead you make hotfixes right on the spot. Here, there are couple schools of thought, some say you should never directly commit to master, and only merge and always tag your merges etc. to keep it clean and fool proof. My thought is that you can always do whatever you like as long as everyone who is using the system knows how to use git and understand git flow. 
Merge and Commit, for most of the part.
Thanks for the list, gives me some theory to play around with in my head. I have a theory that, in general, code that is closer to hardware is more difficult to implement in this way because of inherently rigid design. For example, webGL is very close to the GPU, so the code that works best works in a pattern that resembles the operation of the GPU. The same applies to a lot of internet protocols and communication standards. But once a level of abstraction has been built on top of the hardware, it becomes easier and easier to "unhinge" the code, and the best practices no longer depend on hardware, but on the concept of coding itself. Whether the "beauty" of OO is a result of the way our mind understands it or if it's more a function of abstraction and control I'm not sure. But that's just a theory. And I'm not very good at OO yet, but theories like this seem to help me to plan out my abstractions when I feel a little lost. Does that make sense?
That is kind of mistaken, and i doubt you know the both as the person above making similar claims. React has traditionally been called the V in MVC, or a lib as opposed to a framework. Both Angular and Vue are templating frameworks. They bring a lot more than a view definition (their own javascript emulators, syntax languages, state observables, dependency injection, etc.). Vue in scope and complexity is comparable to Angular, by itself it is several magnitudes bigger in api scope and cognitive overhead than React.
Vue is fine as well, if that's what you wanted to try. It's derinitely a gentler introduction to working with frameworks.
Entirely subjective, depending on your work history background, preference towards architecture, what type of company structure and environment you prefer.
Hacker News tends to attract the startup crowd more than enterprise or agency devs, I wouldn't use it to judge local trends.
Never heard of anyone having to pair program on a interview looks exciting. I think what they want to see is how you think and how you tackle problems and obstacles. Don't be afraid to ask questions, think out loud and to do mistakes. Is how you handle the situation that's interesting not how fancy code you can wrote under pressure. This is atleast what I think :) 
Website down?
Can you please expound this and I'll do my readings and research? I need all the help I can get. I'm actually a 12th grade student from the Philippines and I'm doing this for my capstone project as a requirement. 
Hey OP, I also started with react very recently and I found Max's course on react to be extremely helpful for getting into react. I would totally recommend you get that course and not others as most of the others I found were teaching react 15 while that was the only course teaching react 16 with es6 syntax.

Yes, I've often thought the ordering is wrong. However I generally just type - import {} from 'x' Then go back and use intellisense to pick the functions I want. It's definitely not one of JavaScripts biggest design flaws.
I hear you. It seems like most employers are looking for react developers. But I love vue! One consolation though , vue has added more stars (though react still has more total stars) on GitHub in all of 2017 beating react! 🤩
Just a small tip, and I feel silly saying this, but... * Shower * Deodorant * Clean teeth and mouthwash * Clean clothes * Your shoes and feet do not smell Smile and be pleasant. The person interviewing you isn't expecting you to be perfect, but he is expecting you to be someone he likes and could work with. I think it's also ok to mention you have never pair programmed before (if that's the case) but you think it's a good idea and you're happy to do it.
Use Vue, React, or actually anything. You won't regret it, jQuery development is dying for good reasons.
Create-react-app. I basically start with that for all my projects, no matter the size.
Modern angular barely looks like javascript at all. It's been morphed into some kind of ugly annotated java dialect.
Here's a jsPerf with function invocation. The Proxy version is 150 times slower. That kind of thing worries me, especially when you can use `Object.defineProperty` to get a similar result without the penalty. I'm sure Proxies will improve over time, but there's a lot of catching up to do. I'm interested in exploring state management that is _faster_ than Redux. 
If using separate HTML pages, you don’t need server side code- you could code the transferring values into the URLs as querystrings.
I understood what you are saying. I have two question about it. First, how do you get a specific item on the list? it means that when I remove an item from the list, I have to know what an element is. do you get that information from id attribute on a tag? or another way? Second, if I clear everything in the container, and then if I re-render the list again, I suppose It might be too much work because I just want to take one item out. How do you think so?
&gt; First, how do you get a specific item on the list? it means that when I remove an item from the list, I have to know what an element is. do you get that information from id attribute on a tag? or another way? Either declare the listener in the function that creates the item's element, or grab the item's textContent, or something like that. For example: https://jsfiddle.net/mfo6et8s/ &gt;I suppose It might be too much work because I just want to take one item out. It doesn't particularly matter when the number of elements in question isn't *large*, but yes, that is not such an elegant solution.
I'd recommend Vue, React is overcomplicated, I gave up on it after one day of just trying to set up a working environment for it. Angular4 is great for large/huge apps but isn't that great for someone starting in advanced web-app development.
Try vue.js, pretty easy to start with.
It's worth noting the GPL license, as I suspect lots of people are becoming used to non-copyleft licenses.
What you need to learn is *React*, not the whole webpack/babel/eslint/etc... stack. Use their projetct [create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for now. 
This. The first filter when interviewing someone is: "is this a person I would like to spend 8 hours a day with?"
Gotta agree with this. Done all 3, started with Angular. React and Vue are the future.
Hi! I'm the developer behind FilePond.js, do you mean I need to make it more prominent on the GitHub page?
Look up boundary values and equivalence partitioning, and learn to think about and write your functions as pure, where possible.
I didn't know about either of those but I'm glad you shared. Is there any book, or resource, that goes into detail about testing and discusses topics like boundary values etc? I feel like I'm missing huge gaps of knowledge. Does Uncle Bob, or any other pros, have any good material?
What about jQuery?
Advantages of jQuery: * doesn't need an additional compilation step; * doesn't need a lot of setup work; * doesn't need a whole complicated project configuration &amp; maintenance; * doesn't need to download 500 MB of stuff (Nodejs + 100000 packages) you don't even know what they are for; * you can make a whole project with just Notepad. The disadvantage of jQuery is that, with large apps, maintenance requires a lot of discipline from the developer(s). Also, it's harder to divide your app into smaller parts, and that's essential for maintenance. Conceptually, jQuery is very different from JS frameworks. jQuery is just a library to ease what you can do with plain JS, while the frameworks heavily use [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) concepts. I believe it's worth trying a framework, and you should try. But **don't try just one**, try 3 or 4. Make a small project of each and try to advance a bit, to "get the feel" of the framework. Then you'll have your own opinion on which one you like most.
This pretty much sums all OP should expect.
If your project is simple, just use [jQuery](http://jquery.com/). It's great for [these things](https://stackoverflow.com/q/9249345). However, if you know your project will be large, then you should consider learning a JavaScript framework like AngularJS or React. They allow you to write a large &amp; maintenable project, although the philosophy is completely different, and you'll need some time to learn.
I myself learned from these guys http://www.testingeducation.org/BBST/ but they talk mostly about black box testing. You have an amazing benefit of observation and control of your functions. What I found particularly useful for white box is, as I mentioned, proper software design, that makes it testable, i.e. dependency injection, function purity, data immutability and further concepts mostly covered in functional proframming.
jscpd is great, there's a VSCode extension which saves you jumping through the hoops shown in this article. [Copy/ paste detector] (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paulhoughton.vscode-jscpd)
[Winamp2-js](https://github.com/captbaritone/winamp2-js) just blew my mind!
Hi, I am having some trouble with this. Say for example if the message variable contained the following: Users with red names are either a member of the [http://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/GMT Global Moderation Team] or the [https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/QAT Quality Assurance Team] It will process the first link in the square brackets, but not the second. Everything i've tried has resulted in memory heap message or some kind of infinite loop. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Can you see what the issue is? 
Are you writing a lot of display logic? Do you have to manage component state and application state? Do components have tightly coupled relationships with each other? If the answer is yes to any of those three, you should be using a framework. 
I don't understand your hate, Angular brings JavaScript forward in so many ways. Annotations are awesome. Java and AOP are awesome too.
your regexp is working just fine on https://www.regexpal.com/ the problem is in the while loop while(match = pattern.exec(message)) you're only reading match[0] but match is an array of all results maybe try: for(let i=0;i&lt;match.length;i++) { const myURL = match[i]; console.log(myURL); // do your stuff } 
That shows AngularJs isn't that version 1 of Angular?
Thanks, I have this now: https://hastebin.com/givosezigo.scala but now I am getting: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of null 
Easiest solution is to add an event listener and hide/show in place divs based off of the state of your trigger.
if match isn't an array, then maybe the value for message was empty? `console.log(matches)` to the rescue :p this probably means you have to add a null check on `matches` 
Probably should use JWT and delegate the calls for your server to handle :)
Put the code server-side. There's absolutely *no* way to protect it in the browser. That's why their docs only list Node.JS and other server-side technologies. I've never used their api, but this is true for any rest api unless they specifically provide a key that they say can be used in the browser.
I use Vue in production as well. I love it, but it's not an opinion. Look at the number of job listings for angular and react compared to Vue. I brought Vue to my previous company and do side work for another company in it as well. It very well could be a good choice for the future, but if you're looking right now, it won't help you. I agree with you on the last part, but a lot of places are looking for people with very specific skills. I think they are wrong, but it's just how a lot of people hire unfortunately.
I think it depends on where you are, and the industry. In my city it's something like 50/50. I think most companies don't really care of you know one or the other: You can pick it up easily. I've noticed Angular being very popular within banking/finance or similar companies. Not sure why. Startups/mid-sized almost always go for React for greenfield products. 
This. Banking/finance, at least here in Europe, seems very Angular-heavy. Always exceptions, of course, but I think the monster projects with Java really leans towards Angular because of the type safety it provides to (older) Java devs. 
Same goes for anything, really. You couldn't write Ruby code to bring home the bacon in my city, at all. There are no jobs. Startups don't use it. Whereas elsewhere I've been(asia), it seemed like Ruby was the main "startup"/scripting language. 
Why?
Explore both options. Try using different frameworks and then try using micro-libraries that does one thing and one thing well. Try giving control of DOM to a framework, and then try having DOM control yourself and see if you can maintain it nicely in the long run. I do not think there is right or wrong answer. It will depend on you. And rule #1 is pick what resonates with you, not what the bandwagon claps for. rule #2, think for long term --&gt; don't just buy the industry noise. If you have to buy the industry noise because you need to put food on the table, that's an entirely different problem. rule #3, never forget, doesn't matter how many down-votes this entry gets, every project, depending on its needs, has a level of complexity that cannot be reduced further. You can abstract but cannot completely reduce it. rule #4, industry goes towards refactoring+abstracting everything. This doesn't only happen in programming but in every aspect of our life to reduce build time, effort, cost etc like in car industry for example. I'm sorry to say this but everyone is shifting more towards being a middle man. But, amidst all this, remember that in some rolls royce engines, you will see the signature of the 'technician' who got it together. A good reminder that hardcore-low level knowledge is super valuable. Now you reddit saltlords can downvote as much as you want.
so I would create a node.js server for that, secure that with a JWT or something, and then pass on the requests to Woocommerce's REST API?
You should do everything in a framework, like everyone said angular and react are pretty solid. The issue I see is that you say that you need it ASAP. Learning a framework takes a second or two unless you’re a JS master, which it doesn’t sound like you are. So if you really need that, keep in mind that it is indeed far better to use a framework. I don’t think I’ve ever met a developer who would dream starting a js project without a framework
I'm not sure if it's also because the replace sets it to the link which the regex also looks for so it's matching it twice? 
Great to hear! Any questions just ask
Apologies for the previous misleading comment, from the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/exec) pattern.exec must indeed be run multiple times until it returns null. while( (match = pattern.exec( message )) !== null ) { console.log( match[0] ); // this is your captured URL+text console.log( match[0] ); // this is also your captured URL+text console.log( match[2] ); // this is your URL (the one captured between brackets) console.log( match[3] ); // this is your text (the one captured between brackets) console.log( match[4] ); // this is your secondary URL (the one captured outside brackets) }
As a corporate developer who likes to use open source software, when I see a library with GPL licence I get legal department flashbacks and delete my browsing history.
when I posted, It was 40 :))
You can change [this line](https://github.com/tosbaha/kablonet/blob/master/bin/kablonet#L13) to a const instead of a var. It seems odd that the rest of your require statements use consts and this one uses var.
popover, tooltip is whst you're looking for
Thanks. I guess I forgot to change when I did copy paste from example source code.
Thanks man, there were some really helpful insights in there. I think I'll look into React first and when I have some more time give a try to other stuff. 
Any market driven by self-fulfilling prophecy is just boom bust cycle machine. Web devs are fickle as hell, and now they are driving their own relevence economy? Yikes.
There are certainly companies with legacy code and tech debt issues that use jQuery, but one does not imply the other.
If a company was doing a new product and chose to use jQuery, I wouldn't want in either
I’ll give this a try, thanks!
Sure. Meanwhile I'll go read more of the MDN docs and maybe read bit more about linear algebra for one of my projects. In the worst case, the language I use will get some backwards compatible features and the math part has been basically the same for centuries. Decisions, decisions...
Thanks.
Thanks for the mention. I'd wondered why my blog had a jump in hits on that post.
 (\[?(https?:\/\/[^\]\s]+) `[?` &lt;&lt; opening bracket is optional so the first capture parenthesis match both with and without the bracket 
Well, that's your prerogative. Just know that there is nothing about jQuery that implies legacy tech and/or mindset.
Why did you delete you old post about the lib?
Honestly for you case it’smodt likely fine (and recommended) to use a webpack shim to load the libraries globally right away. That being said, have you tried any of the other text editor libraries? I’ve used Ace/Brace in a few projects and that was a very pleasant library. There is also Codemirror, maybe check those out if Pen isn’t built as a module. By the way, Ace and Codemirror are the basis for many really serious online editing platforms, ie. if I remember correctly, AWS Cloud9, Codesandbox, JSBin, and many more
Thanks for all your help so far. OK. So currently, this is where I am at. I have this https://themeq.s-ul.eu/MuLrfzmt.png from this code https://hastebin.com/oneniyifaz.scala So unfortunately, I think I am back at square one :( 
For starters, not every app requires a heavy front-end. Sometimes a bit of interactivity is all that's needed, and jQuery works great for that, where something like React, Angular, Vue, etc. can be a net negative. Highly dynamic front-ends also have very significant SEO implications that can be cumbersome and inefficient to work around (if at all), necessitating a shift back to the server. Plenty of apps still have to target non-ES6+ compatibility, as well. And, no matter what your beliefs about technology, a team that's extremely strong and familiar writing jQuery will turn out a better, higher quality product and do so more efficiently using jQuery than they will if they're forced into a new and unfamiliar stack.
&gt; a team that's extremely strong and familiar writing jQuery will turn out a better, higher quality product and do so more efficiently using jQuery than they will if they're forced into a new and unfamiliar stack. And as a result, the company won't attract anyone remotely ambitious and/or young because team old-farts don't like change. If you're writing a small application that doesn't require Vue/Angular/React, vanilla JS does the job today. jQuery hands you a bunch of stuff you already have. 
Don't do it. Using a minifier to save bandwidth is fine, but obfuscation has no positive effect for anyone.
I haven't tried this, but I imagine you can do something like `import 'path/to/markdown.js'` 
Add it to your vendor.js and use the providerPlugin, or whatever WP4 has replaced it with

AOP all the way! Java isn't for everything, but it's one of the best languages out there for enterprise work.
Depends on the task at hand, as always. Java is a great tool for a lot of things, and an awful one for some. You rarely go wrong with Java, though. It isn't sexy, but it works and it's very "safe" in a way. 
It looks like TypeScript with a template syntax and framework code. The annotations aren't horrible. They are simple and useful. Our code has come out consistent and clean. I'm not a fan of Java -- way too verbose and limiting (drives me a little crazy). I work in a Python shop and love it. But on the frontend, we're using Angular and it's solid. I'm sure React is great too but I haven't had to use it professionally yet. 
Can you name one thing it's great for other than pumping out fresh undergrads ? While some of the newer features reduce the pain somewhat, it's still so crippled as a programming language.
What the heck were you doing? I agree that older Java sucks, but 7+ is a pleasure.
This is fucking retarded. Engineering is not pop culture.
Java 8 features reduced the pain, but nothing can make it pleasant. Enterprise services in spring can never be good, by definition. It's a teaching toy not a scalable solution. C, go, python, node, and nearly any non jvm language are far better at the enterprise level. You will see java start to fade in the enterprise realm.
There's also a (paid) commercial license. It's obvious that the use of the GPL for the open-source license was very intentional.
Have you ever been a developer on large projects? Say 30+ developers? It's verbosity forces certain patterns. That's it's strength. Which is a pain in the ass if you're doing a hobby project for certain. Professionally, it provides consistency and has a good building environment as well as ecosystem to maintain that consistency. 
That's an interesting point. I found Spring to be a boon vs the older bean configuration methods, which is not to say it doesn't all go to hell if your team gets lazy. I don't think Java is going anywhere. Spring as a framework will be replaced by something newer once enough people get frustrated.

You don't need to split location.pathname, it's not how it works. try this https://pastebin.com/ivvGuXZK
Hi! Dev behind FilePond.js, that's why I also offer a commercial license. Were you expecting to see it more clearly communicated on the github page (it's at the bottom)?
React is neither html nor css, right? Angular uses both and adds * and () and [] for templates and events and binding and so easy to see and is still valid HTML
still cannot get it to work. but anyway, thank you so much!!! :D
Ttry doing it like below. var files = [file1, file2, file3, file4]; var ramdomNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * files.length); var file = files[randomNum]; //... link.href = file; 
 var file=`./../css/backgroundGradientAnimation${Math.floor(Math.random()*4)+1}.css`; var link=document.createElement("link"); link.href=file; link.type="text/css"; link.rel="stylesheet"; link.media="screen,print"; document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(link);
I am a JS noob (only know basic JS), my best languages are Python, C++/C and SQL. I am just wondering if jQuery is worth learning, it seems not. What is an ideal way or place to learn React (if that's the ideal thing right now in JS)?
TypeScript + React 
Do you use google calendar api ? 
I wrote this blog post!
Is this dude just spamming this link or what? Been in every web related sub the past 3 days.
Learning React doesn't make much sense if you're not there yet with JavaScript. Learn the basics, then learn a framework :)
Basically I have everything I need but I just don’t know how to insert the selected element, I tried document.queryselector but hat didn’t work 
I enjoy that combo but it doesn't change the fact that Angular is batteries included whereas they're excluded in React. Some people prefer one over the other.
.NET is a popular enterprise language. Angular is well fitted for enterprise use because it has all the needed parts for a big single page application. React needs state management, router etc. installed as another module from NPM. Enterprise devs don't like that. They prefer everything in one package.
It's not *just* purity. Purity is a necessary condition for a program to be considered functional, however there are a wide variety of techniques that have been developed under the functional umbrella to accomplish certain tasks without mutable state; these techniques all fall under the umbrella of FB just as classes, encapsulation, polymorphism, etc. all fall under the umbrella of OOP. Some examples of these techniques include currying, composition, recursion, folds, lazy evaluation, type classes, and lenses. Purity is just one part of the equation, and with pure functions alone you won't get very far without the tools listed above.
I'll need to take deeper look into SubState, although some of the challenges I've run into when using a pub-sub pattern before, even with the idea of a 'flux-like' store, and maybe Substate has ways of addressing this. * Often my components care about the data that changed, not the cause of the change - I just care that "user.firstName" changed - not nessicarly the event that caused it to change. * Wiring up '.on' event handlers in components got heavy-handed after awhile * If I wanted to handle things that were triggered by more than 1 event (basically - more than 1 area of state changing) - say: applied filters, cart, product item I was getting into weird cases of like, (note: pseduo code - this was in an Angular 1 app, and going from memory) eventualDataOne = deferrerd promise; eventualDataTwo = defferred promis someBus.on('eventOne', ()=&gt; eventualDataOne.resolve('eventPayload')) someBus.on('eventTwo', ()=&gt; eventualDataTwo.resolve('eventPayload')) Promise.all([eventualDataOne,eventualDataTwo]).then(()=&gt;do stuff) This would work well for 'one off events' - but then got tricky for stuff data that might change over the lifetime of the component (of which I would probably use Observables instead of a deffered promise) Where redux+reselect is handy though, is more "I just care about state change" - then creating selectors to then derive the rest of the data from different pieces for me. I would also run into issues of wanting to subscribe to an event, but something emitted it first - but basically a "I want the most recent result of the event, even if I was not yet subscribed at the time) The thing I had built before, was sort of * had a bunch of 'List' services - these were initially not meant to be stores, but they ended up becomming that * I had services for business logic/data/etc so if needed to say, save a user, was a bit of. userService.saveUser(data); userService would call the API, save the user - when that promise resolved, do `someBus.emit('user_update', newUserData)` The list services (which basically became stores), would listen to that - update the store state, then emit `someBus.emit('user_updated')` Like I said, this kind of ended up being an 'accidental-flux-like' based on pub-sub, it was also an architecture that evolved that way. If doing it over from scratch, without redux - would probably be better, but when redux entered my world it was like 'ah-hah! yes'. SubState might have solutions for these issues, or - your state needs might not match mine, and SubState is the right fit. Just sort of rambling about issues I ran into when using a similar pattern, and SubState might just be doing it better than I was :) 
nope. You can measure it, it's just a bit hard to. We've switched big angular codebase to react and we've seen increased throughput for every developer in our team. IMHO it's mostly due to: * hot reload when developing decreases time spent in the browser greatly. With angular we've always waited for the whole page to reload. * much easier to write test for our react components * much faster tests in jest. Maybe this is JSDOM at fault here but it's much faster at executing all the tests now in react * community is much more responsive-bugs in react libraries that we use are fixed so much faster. My friend who still works with angular is always bitching about third party libraries which are unmaintained/badly maintained
There are two reasons why it is that way: * Reading ergonomics: The URL can get long. Then it is easier to read everything if it comes last. * History: Identifier-first is how assignment and require() in CommonJS modules works. If typing slows you down, you can use a snippet: http://2ality.com/2017/08/typing-import-statements.html
Is it open source? What stack are you using?
I made a simple comparison between redux and react-stateful : https://twitter.com/r13127igOr/status/969609230553665536
already working. problem was lying within: - the way as the overall URL was being called apparently: - you cannot ./../etc. in javascript (that works in shell/bash, but not in javascript specifically) the right way to fix this (at least in my case): - getting the script under root; - linking it from the root with proper paths however: - this is not the best solution; - if someone can help me on fixing the right way of calling relative paths, or in this case local paths properly from within javascript, i would be thankful
thx u so much! here is the gif of what tradingview. com has implemented. they have "replay" feature for all stocks.It's almost ideal, https://ibb.co/kCQva7 however, it's not based on tick data and still a bit zig zaggy and glitchy. there is ideal tester called "forex tester" but only for currency pairs, and look at how smoothly it runs, cuz simulations based on tick data, this is ideally what I wanted to build for stocks: https://ibb.co/nvEh57 https://ibb.co/cYWbF7 this tester has amazing scalability of canvas and zooming. on other forums i found 3 viable options: techan.js, plotly , highcharts the only problem appears to be is the quality of data: the best one - called tickdata costs in the ballpark of 20k-80k$ for all US stocks from 2010. 1min bars are ok, but in addition, there is js fiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/z6wnjf6m/13/ ,very rough draft. this youtube video explains and demonstrates why I want to build such a utility https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ9pnTVtvs 
It's badly designed because you're used to the way python is designed ?
You forgot a third option: be a mature adult, and explain to your date why you don’t think things will work out, and politely leave. Pro-tip: make your first date a coffee/drink date. It’s cheap, and can be quickly ended if things aren’t working out. 
I'm using Node/Express with Mongo, and handlebars/jQuery on the front end. The project isn't officially open-sourced (although, of course, the content is all community-generated), but the [code is on github](https://www.github.com/maximforever/dictionary).
&lt;Confession/&gt; I dont write import statements by hand at all. Just use named exports and have unique names for stuff that you export.

When a thing gets highly voted in one web related sub, it gets posted again and again for the next day or so in other web related subs. 
Go to learn js bro, u can pm me if you don't find the solution there. This doesn't look complex.
everything you've done with javascript so far has been in the confines of a browser window. with your current knowledge of javascript it is impossible to make a web server that could serve up a dynamic web application you make. you would have to use another language (e.g. Python) to do that. node is software that lets you run javascript code anywhere on your computer, opening up a whole new area of opportunities in javascript development. it contains the google chrome javascript engine (called V8), an interpreter (also known as the node REPL), a standard library of functions that lets you do things like interact with the file system, and a few other things. that's all it is, and there's not a lot of magic to it. becoming familiar with node and the node package manger (npm) should take you at most a few days. you can bootstrap a React application without any worrying about webpack using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), but I am assuming that whatever course you're following will make you go through creating a react app the "hard" way so as to get you familiar with how the architecture of a react app looks like. this is a good thing. as for ES6 syntax, you don't *have* to use it, but if you're planning on keeping up to date with javascript -- and you should -- then learning it is massively within your interest.
you can use no framework if you're app just needs a tiny bit of user interaction JS.
Ok will do mate, I’ve posted in a couple of Facebook groups aswell so hopefully I can get it sorted ! 
Thanks, actually i've found the plugin i had in my mind, it was http://tether.io/ but they also suggest popper.js Thanks!
Sure, thanks :) i was only sareching for a plugin, have i wrote in the wrong sub?
Nope! I'm using ReactJS to make a frontend for an ASP.NET service. You should, as you say, learn about ES6 and all that, but Node isn't necessary.
No, you definitely don't need to "learn Node". Then again, I suppose it also depends on what you mean by "_learn_". Let me explain further: - React itself does not require any build tools, and can be used with just [two simple script tags in an `index.html` file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/master/static/html/single-file-example.html). There's also online IDEs and playgrounds like [CodeSandbox](http://codesandbox.io/) and [CodePen](https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/hello-world) where you can write real working React projects without having to install anything locally. (For more details, see the ["Try React" docs page](https://reactjs.org/docs/try-react.html).) - However, most "real" React applications will use several build tools, which do things like bundle and minify the application for production, transform newer JS syntax into older syntax that works in more browsers, "lint" the code for possible errors, format the code to match a style guide, and so on. Almost all these build tools are written in Javascript, so they need the Node.js runtime to execute them, in the same way that you need to have Python installed to run Python apps, the JRE to run Java apps, the .NET Framework to run C# apps, and so on. (There's a great explanation of [why you might want to use a build tool like Webpack for bundling your Javascript](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/7qdksl/having_a_hard_time_understanding_webpack/dsoq9p3/) that was written in this subreddit recently.) - Almost all JS libraries and tools are available through a package registry called NPM, and can be installed using package managers like `npm` and `yarn`. That makes it easier to add new libraries to your application, instead of having to go download the prebuilt JS files and save them yourself. These package managers are also written in JS, and also require Node to run them. So: you don't _need_ these tools to build a React app, but most "real" React apps do use these tools. The [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) tool is the recommended way to set up a new React project. It creates a project with a good default setup for these build tools, so you don't have to worry about configuring them yourself.
Thank you very much sir
Sometimes a company will be married to a product like WordPress. WP is not legacy but chances are if you're using it that you are already having jQuery loading. Might as well use it.
my interest died when i saw that GPL license.
I'm not going to halt any discussion that are ongoing, but I have removed the post from appearing on /r/javascript.
No way it's a contrived example meant to be a fun way of demoing some APIs. Nope the author definitely meant for people to use this in real world situations. So parties, do you get invited to them much? You seem like you would be great fun to be around.
there are a lot of variables that could be const also what tool do you use for coding you caould use some eslint to improve your code quality for example you are mixing tabs and spaces. https://eslint.org/ https://code.visualstudio.com/
thanks.. that was my motivation initially to build something like this.
&gt; And as a result, the company won't attract anyone remotely ambitious and/or young because team old-farts don't like change ;-) Companies aren't in the business of maintaining the latest and greatest tech stacks. They're in the business of making money. If "change" doesn't come with pragmatic benefit (read: won't make them more money) for their specific use-case, then, quite simply, there is no valid reason for them to change. Nor should they; changing for change's sake is dumb. And changing to "attract anyone remotely ambitious and/or young" is fool-hardy. The only developers you'll be attracting by doing this that you otherwise wouldn't have are those who aren't yet experienced enough to know that their favored/preferred techs are not always the right solution when it comes to solving real-life business problems, and they don't tend to make for very constructive team members in the long run. It isn't that "old-farts don't like change" (though we've all met people like this before), it's that the more experience you get in the industry, the more you learn that pragmatism trumps dogmatism. There are plenty of situations where a React or an Angular is the right tool for the job, but it's important to realize that that isn't _all situations_. Younger developers somehow get it in their heads that, if it's not the latest and greatest, it's somehow inferior. But that's not how the real world works. &gt; If you're writing a small application that doesn't require Vue/Angular/React, vanilla JS does the job today. jQuery hands you a bunch of stuff you already have. Some things, perhaps (depending on your minimum requirements), but jQuery has plenty of advantages over vanilla JS that you won't find even in bleeding edge JS implementations. So, that leaves you either reimplementing portions of it as needed, or subbing in other dependencies that do the same thing. The former would be pretty dumb for obvious reasons, and the latter would be functionally equivalent to simply using jQuery, so it doesn't really offer any benefits other than the perceived benefit of making you feel better about yourself for not using "legacy tech" or some such. Again, not very pragmatic. &gt; Just because you're used to it doesn't mean it's necessary. No, but it _does_ mean that sometimes it's the best tool for the job. Familiarity is an important part of finding the right solution to problems. Learning new things is great, but it always comes at a cost. If that cost is "hey, our team knows React pretty well, all except John, so we'll have to bring him up to speed for this next project", then maybe React is the right solution. If that cost is "no one on our team knows the first thing about React, but we're all jQuery experts", then whether React is the right solution or not is going to come down to whether the benefits you gain from it outweigh the enormous cost of retraining an entire team. And, anecdotally, that doesn't happen very often in practice.
Node is a standard, professional web development without it is nearly impossible today. So, yes, it makes sense to at least understand what it is. You don't need to understand specifics, but being able to deal with npm and at least a bundler will enable so many things later on. It's less scary than you think. If you think you're not ready for it yet you have a couple of alternatives: 1. install node + create-react-app 2. online prototyping: https://codesandbox.io/ 3. the ugliest choice, script tags: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/master/static/html/single-file-example.html
Yep. And if you don't need anything afforded to you by jQuery, then that would likely be the best solution for that sort of app. In other cases, jQuery may be right choice.

It does and it's not about being cheap but about not understanding the GPL and the legal impact it has on the project. My employer already pays big bucks for dubious software we don't really need, that's not the problem at all.
If the element exists, you *should* be able to querySelect it. Can you post the page/element in question?
Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't that for if you want to do something once the element has been clicked? I am trying to click a button that doesn't exist in View Page Source (only Inspect Element since that is uupfated) on someone's website.
Thanks for this well-written reply. Yeah I can see there being an issue in an Angular 1 app, b/c you might be setting watchers on parts of a model. With regards to the `userService` it looks like SubState always emits `STATE_UPDATED` when the state changes but also can emit a `CUSTOM_EVENT` if you want to. It also has a way of returning only the slice of state you've updated. So that's a nice thing too. So yeah it's "accidental-flux-like" from the start with topic and content-based filtering baked into the pub/sub. I think it addresses those problems. I'd have to check out their demo further. 
Can someone explain exactly why GPL turns so many people off?
Thank you! I might actually take you up on that. I love UX, but UI/graphic design is definitely my weakest point.
Shoot me a note at max@hackterms.com if you have any specific ideas!
No, you don't. You can build a perfectly functional web app without a nodejs backend server. Not only can you use other platforms for the backend like traditional .NET, PHP, Ruby on Rails, Python or Java based servers, but you can also go entirely serverless with options like Firebase and AWS (clientside js sdk, and things like lambda). There is no necessary or implied connection between React and Node aside from them both using JavaScript.
Are you sure the element responds to a click, and not to a mouseup or mousedown? Instead of calling .click(), try calling .onmouseup() or .onmousedown() Note also that a true call to onclick (and mouseup/down) will have an Event as first parameter, so you'd need to use dispatchEvent if the function expects it. &gt; it seems it cannot find the div Is that the true error you are getting? Try `document.getElementById('x')` in the console, you should get the correct element.
Done :)
How do you recommend to learn the basics then?
I overlooked the post above that you were replying onto. I thought you were asking about the previous comment.
Only activates on click. document.getElementById('x'); Using Console, the above returns the element, but document.getElementById('x').click(); returns &gt;undefined 
Hi /u/tekgur1, For javascript help, please visit /r/LearnJavascript. Thank you!
If you know programming basics(conditionals, for/while loops, etc etc), then I'd take "javascript: understanding the weird parts" on Udemy. It was an eye opener for myself. 
I have dealt with the basics in other programming languages quite a bit. I will look into this course. Is it a paid one? Thanks.
It is paid but Udemy has sales something like once a month. It should go for around $10-15 which is great value, on sale. 
Are you sure both refer to the same element? document.getElementById('x') === document.getElementsByClassName(y)[0] should return true.
No worries at all, just wanted you to know. Thanks
No. 
No one here seems to be understanding your question. Try using a `setInterval` to repeatedly check if the div exists. If it doesn't, keep going. If it does, clear the interval and do what you want to do. Or, more simply (but more fragile), just use `setTimeout` once and hope the element exists by the time the callback gets called. 
Legal departments are allergic to mentions of strong copyleft licenses due to FUD that Microsoft heavily spread during the early rise of Linux based operating systems. That’s where the “viral license” meme comes from. If you want a deep dive, look up the Halloween Documents series, specifically from ESR. Here’s a link http://www.catb.org/esr/halloween/
better solution is using one css file with many classes and changing element class with javascript example: https://codepen.io/dummefil/pen/WMWvGp?editors=1111
Answering here as interested in this too. I'm pretty much in the same spot as you, though I've been working as a contractor for the past 2 years. I'm going to start interviewing soon as a senior front end developer and I could definitely use some resources to brush up on.
What issue do you take with GPL?
Know graph problems really well. The DOM is a graph after all. Unfortunately, data structures / algorithms is hard to adequately prepare for just because the subject matter is so large. What projects/products does the company work on? Do they utilize service workers? Any other special web APIs? What frameworks do they use? Brush up on anything that might be relevant to the core business. They're trying to figure how quickly you can ramp up with their tech. Do you understand how the event loop works? What types of things affect performance, how can you break up intensive tasks to keep the UI responsive (service workers, scheduling work with setTimeout/requestAnimationFrame/etc)? More on performance: be prepared to explain how to debug a performance issue. What types of CSS properties can be changed without causing an expensive reflow (hint: opacity and transform)? Why? JavaScript basics: if they explicitly called out ES2015 be prepared to talk about let/const, iterators, arrow functions, and there's probably more I can't think of :). More JS questions: Explain prototypal inheritance. Why might I need to call Function.prototype.bind? How do you cancel an event? How do you fetch data from a server? On top of all that, be prepared to talk about past projects. Ive found people LOVE asking about your "favorite bug." If you're like me and have a hard time recalling a single bug, spend some time beforehand brainstorming or inventing a response. 
No, the issue is that Python’s design makes implementing automatic completion easier for IDEs.
but is there an api for that???
Let me know when you find stuff. Never found advanced stuff mostly beginner and some intermediate stuff. 
you are such a great person. Thank you so much. 
I think I work on the project with vue.js. Actually, I considered it, but I thought It was too much for just a simple project. However, I think I should probably see that way again. Thank you for your favor.
OMG... Why I wouldn't have thought this idea. I think It's a great way without using React or Angular that is sort of huge libraries.
Feels good man. Thanks
300+ devs, major public corporation. The start time for their enterprise service site is like 45 minutes. Release cycle is one per month if lucky, with week long code freezes. Java hell and back again. We swapped out one java message processor for a lua+nginx version and got a 1000x perfect boost. A different middleware enterprise app with even higher load done as nodejs service does comparable work with one tenth the team size.l, near instant start time, and daily release to production. The only reason java is still used at all is organizational inertia, and the hundred of useless devs who can't do anything else. 
Yes, newer spring is better. in the sense that it is slight less horrible. It's still an atrocity when compared to flask, express, go.http, etc Nearly anything trounces it for enterprise. 
Thank you! I'll give it a read.
Know some common algorithms they are going to ask: fizz buzz, anagrams, pyramids, Fibonacci, matrix spiral, etc. Also know how to implement some basic data structures: queues, linked lists, trees, etc.
React works with 2 script tags. . . uh, what about jsx? Precompiler??
As some who uses node and java. You are clearly doing java wrong.
try [this](https://hastebin.com/agakemeriy.scala) ?
Never really got the concept of validating props passed in. If you really want to do this, why not just use typescript or flow? You can still do runtime assertions higher up in your application's entrypoints. I feel like doing all these assertions in your view layer is more a symptom than a solution.
Any programming language will suck if you have incompetent developers. That's a given. 
Any chance for a browse/flashcard mode?
Check this out: http://book.goalkicker.com/JavaScriptBook/ Seeing as you're confident with DS/Algos and the browser, this book, while imperfect, does cover a lot of the more nuance-y parts related to JavaScript, like the APIs that come hand in hand with it. I hadn't come across APIs things like MessageEvents, ServerSentEvents (not using sockets) until I perused this book. Probably good to get well versed enough to talk about cross-origin as well as security issues like XSS and how to identify and deal with them.
Will try it. Looks nice.
Did you know it' been done before? http://hackersdictionary.com/html/The-Jargon-Lexicon-framed.html (it may be out of date, and was assembled by a couple of editors rather than modern croudsourcing)
That's just the way java is. It's an overgrown toy language.
Try setTimeout set to 0 seconds. This should mean that your code runs after any other code on the stack. Hopefully your element will have been added to the DOM by the time your code runs. Either that or use setInterval and then clearInterval after the element has been clicked.
Not sure why I expected a library called “unstated” to have a readme
I just had [this exact discussion with someone on Twitter](https://twitter.com/acemarke/status/969683847423184896). JSX is not required. Literally, all you need is to include script tags for `react.js` and `react-dom.js`, and then you write "raw" `React.createElement()` calls. However, most people find that to be too repetitive. So, the "default" approach is to use JSX syntax, which converts `&lt;MyComponent a={1} b="blah"&gt;Text&lt;/MyComponent&gt;` into `React.createElement(MyComponent, {a : 1, b : "blah"}, "Text")`. Yes, JSX requires a transformation/compiler step. As I said earlier, a typical "real" app needs build tools to bundle anyway, and you're probably targeting a variety of browsers but don't want to restrict yourself to the least common denominator subset of JSX syntax, so you're probably already using a transpiler too. But, if you truly don't want to use JSX for whatever reason, there's plenty of choices: - Write raw `React.createElement()` calls by hand - Alias `React.createElement()` as `h()` so it's shorter - Use a functional VDOM wrapper generation library like [`react-hyperscript-helpers`](https://github.com/Jador/react-hyperscript-helpers/). - Use a runtime JS templating library like Dominic Gannaway's [`t7` templates](https://github.com/trueadm/t7) - Use an actual separate templating library, like [`react-templates`](https://github.com/wix/react-templates) or [`handlebars-react`](https://github.com/stevenvachon/handlebars-react) Almost everyone chooses to use JSX. The docs use JSX. Tutorials across the internetuse JSX. It's the accepted approach. But, it's not _required_. You do not _need_ it. There are other options. It's your choice.
Senior.. fizz buzz.. ?
Yes. It's called a conversation/dialogue. Unfortunately, nearly every human has a different API, so there may be some impedance mismatches.
If I'm setting timeout to 0 then why use timeout? Would you be able to show me exactly how I could use setInterval/clearInterval once the element has been clicked please?
A lot of people applying to senior level gigs get it wrong ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Had me until Handlebars/jQuery Can we please stop using jQuery?
That's a rather unfortunate name for a NES emulator... Anyway, as far as I can tell, the emulator by itself isn't designed to handle output, timing, and a bunch of other things, so it's not really a turnkey solution like that. You could look at the [jsnes-web](https://github.com/bfirsh/jsnes-web) repo for an example of a more complete package.
Ha yeah! It’s not the most creative name, but a solid project. Thanks for the reply as well. As far as getting the web version to work...just upload to the public_html folder “as is”? Do I need to create and index.html and put anything in it?
The Web version is a React app, so you need to build it and upload the output of that. You should look into how building a React project works, but the gist is that you set up NPM, then do `npm install` and `npm run build` in the project directory.
Maybe they'll fix it in the next revision
Thanks a ton! I appreciate the help, and I’ll definitely look into React. 
Fizz buzz is sort of a double edged sword. It weeds out a lot of garbage, but there's a subset of qualified devs who are insulted to be asked questions like that. You kinda have to be careful to say something to the effect of "sorry I had to ask you that, you wouldn't believe some of the people HR lets into interviews" 
no offense but that's a horrible way to work. not to mention your code will be a nightmare for anyone else unlucky enough to come after you. You're better off with vue if you want to avoid a precompile step. 
Yes. clearInterval
I never said any of those things are required.
I did not fully understand, but try this, maybe it will work :) https://codepen.io/dummefil/pen/PQgNab?editors=1111
The point is that it works. But obviously webpack and JSX exist for a reason.
Thank you! I struggled with this, and I'm glad it helps others, too :)
Great idea! Tell me more about what that'd look like?
My test usually involves understanding a sync control flow, tail call recursion, and working around bad JS code without touching it.
In general, the more you think of an interview like a date, the better off you'll be.
Heh, amusing. On a slightly more serious note, I will point to: - The Redux FAQ entries on ["When should I use Redux?"](https://redux.js.org/faq/general#when-should-i-use-redux) and ["How should I decide what to put into Redux vs React component state?"](https://redux.js.org/faq/organizing-state#do-i-have-to-put-all-my-state-into-redux-should-i-ever-use-react's-setstate) - Dan Abramov's article [You Might Not Need Redux](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367), which talks about the tradeoffs Redux asks you to make and the benefits you get in return, as well as use cases where Redux is definitely beneficial - My own posts [The Tao of Redux, Part 1 - Implementation and Intent](http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-1/) and [The Tao of Redux, Part 2 - Practice and Philosophy](http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-2/), which talk about the intent behind Redux's design and why common usage patterns exist 
What’s wrong with the jargon file?
&gt;cancel all current (still working requests) Using what interface? With Fetch at least, it seems insufficiently supported.
I would probably be using requests. Perhaps I dont need to cancel the current requests, but I would have to ignore them. Just trying to think how I would only act on the first response. Right now the only thing I can think of besides async race is just having a global variable which would update on a liked response and then would ignore everything else
My rule of thumb is: if you're writing an app, use map/filter/reduce. If you're writing libraries, use for loops. for loops are typically used in performance sensitive code. Virtual dom libraries and parsers use them almost exclusively, for example. Another reason for using for loops is that they allow you to express algorithms that are different from "go through a list in ascending sequential order". In the virtual dom case, a commonly used algorithm is known as "prefix/suffix", which effectively does a "trim" operation on two arrays simultaneously. This cannot be easily expressed in terms of map/filter/reduce without allocating a ton of memory. Let's also not forget while loops which are used for unbounded looping and have no functional array method equivalent. If all you're doing is piping data from axios to React, yeah, just use map/filter/reduce.
Defining some of these terms is hard. I ended up doing lots of Yak Shaving, that is backtracking to solve problems necessary to solve the initial problem, while defining some terms. 
Sorry I'm used to coding in Python so I really don't know much JavaScript. Would you be able to show me how I can do it in the context of my initial request? Thanks.
This works perfect apart from now it doesn't process url's on there own message = "test http://www.google.co.uk"; Uncaught RangeError: Invalid string length. Thanks.
Thank you
I've heard that they now refer to Angular 1.x as "AngularJs" and 2+ is now just "Angular". My company used AngularJs extensively, but bailed on it for new projects after all the 2+ volatility. At first, I resented it, but I've grown to like how simple and focused React is. Most anything it doesn't provide is now built in to EcmaScript 2015.
I'm on mobile but here's the basic idea: setInterval returns an object (I actually have never inspected it. It might just be a number or something) . Think of it as an id for the interval. When you call "setInterval", the engine periodically queues up another call of your function and returns that id. Calling "clearInterval" on that id will make it so the engine stops queuing up your callback (so it doesn't get called again). So basically, don't clear if the element doesn't exist yet. When you do finally get the element, clearInterval on the id (which you must store in a variable when you call setInterval) and then use the element as you wish. Hope that makes sense. 
 Whatever describes your code better. If you're iterating over the elements of an array, then I would use map or reduce. If you need to do something exactly 100 times, I would use a for loop. For loops are more performant, but my opinion is that you should use whatever describes what you're trying to do with better clarity. 
I'm curious, how far have you programmed and tested the functionality so far? The reason I'm asking is that I've had some troubles with mass requests before, where there appeared to be some kind of rate limit being imposed; start too many requests too fast and some just randomly timed out or gave a Network Error. My conclusion was that the likely culprit was the server on which this NodeJS script was running. Have you experienced anything resembling such a rate limit?
element.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent("click")); 
Yeah if you asked me that question in a sr dev interview it would make me think they/the company has no idea wtf is going on.

Highly unlikely. While they both add typing they go about it very differently.
It's really interesting. I've been on both sides of the table. You wouldn't believe some of the "candidates" you get looking for mid or senior developers. After being on the interviewer side, I pretty much stopped being offended by softball questions when being interviewed. If you care at all about getting a competent dev, you HAVE to screen for these guys. Not to mention, you can learn a fair amount from how someone goes about solving it. Are they reciting the answer because they looked it up this morning? Are they reciting the answer because they worked it out the first time and then have done it 100 times since? Are they trolling you with some crazy bass ackward answer that technically works but oh god why? Or playing games trying to solve in under 30 characters? Are they confused and talking themselves in circles? Are they genuinely figuring it out right in front of you? There's a lot of ways it can go, and each one tells you something. Usually with decent devs, once you realize they have it you can stop them and apologize/make an excuse. "My boss makes me ask that" or "we get occasionally some people with really good resumes who don't actually know anything about programming".
I am using Visual Studio Code and thanks for the feedback.
Thanks everyone! 
Yes this book looks really good 👍
Alright Thank you for the advice 👍 And for Data Structures and Algorithms, currently I am doing a course on FrontendMasters by Bianca Gandolfo but will surely checkout CS Dojo's videos. 
Stephen Grider on Udemy has covered all these topics in his Interview Bootcamp Course but I feel like it is of beginner level.
IMO, using libraries dampens our creativity. i.e. made us lazier. Libraries are great when time is not on our side.
If you're using Fetch for the requests, then you can't. Fetch requests can't be aborted. Its specifications doesn't provide a way to abort an ongoing request (yet). I'd suggest you use XMLHttpRequest if you want to immediately abort network requests. Obviously, since you'll need to have a reference to the request object before you can abort it, store newly created requests in a list. Each time before or after creating a requests, check for a variable e.g. `dontCreateMore` in case the whole process is aborted. When the whole process is aborted, on the list of requests, call each request object's `abort()` method. After that, clear the list.
Some terms might benefit from very simple definitions that are labeled "ELI5" for non/less technical users who land on the site. 
Everything you just said has to do with implementation and nothing to do with the framework. Sprawling templates? Fault of the developer. Don’t like Angular Material or don’t understand it? Cool. Don’t use it. It’s not a dependency. It’s just JavaScript (or Typescript)? What are you even talking about? Yep that’s the language both use/can use. Split out logic? Yep that’s the same too. Not sure the point even made there. It sounds like you just need something as lightweight as possibly with half the features and functionality. Which is fine. That’s why React is a lib and Angular is framework. At the end of the day, it’s cool you like React. I like React, too. But as someone who has spent a shit load of time with both, the arguments you are making above don’t make any sense and the issue I continue to have with the React &gt; Angular arguments I see are made by those who have clearly never used Angular in any meaningful, complex application, let alone applications at enterprise scale. 
Thanks for the example. Is `setTimeout()` something required in promises? A lot of examples use it, but I rarely have seen it used in the so-called real world.
That was just an example of something asynchronous - in your case, you would have `fs.readdir(path, function(err, items) {` instead.
So yeah, Angular 1.x is now retroactively AngularJS. But there are about 10,000,000 blogs/forums/news articles/stack overflow posts from 2012-2016 referring to it as “Angular”, which makes google results a fucking mess. Just another reason to use React. 
That works. There must be something else you're not telling us about your specific scenario or environment.
Alright first I caught my typo `resove`. 2ndly, I saw that my `resolve/reject` was outside of the scope of `fs.readdir`. [updated fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/monsto/2f3k8891/2/) The log on #28 shows the contents of the `corner` array, but . . . wait... ok I'm fucking with it. Again thanks for your, well for lack of a better word, handholding.
Yeah since the resolve was simply a log, it wasn't returning any data, so the `result` in the below `prom.then` was undefined. Once I set `collection` in there, it outputs the full object on line #36. I need to chew on this. your example and the google page helped me with the syntax, making it work. It's still kinda a magic box, but at least I have something in my own writing that I can analyze. Thank you for your help, etc.
I believe the website itself would be limiting you, you would have to use proxies which circulate

Web pages are mostly used for information, but sometimes they have interactivity. Web apps mean you can easily use that interactivity without having to open your web browser
Yeah I wasn't sure how hard you were following the thread. Thanks for your responses tho. It was all very helpful.
😶
Very nice one. Thanks.
IMO there isn’t a clear divider of what makes them different. Generally web pages are for consuming content like blogs, news sites, and marketing sites that don’t have a lot of interactivity. Web apps are for “doing things” and being productive like Google Docs, social media sites, and Mint. They tend to be highly interactive. 
I've worked at Apple, Google, and FB and never prepared for an interview. Honestly unless you're straight out of university your work history should already have you prepared for questions in your direct field. Questions outside of this are a different issue and it depends how the individual company hires (i.e. do they expect "front end engineers" to be what the title says? Or do they expect you to specialize in that and be able to do almost anything if needed?) I know I bombed a couple of the questions during my Google interview (well maybe not bombed, but definitely didn't give "strong hire" answers), but these were way outside of my expertise. Things like "how would you design a fault tolerant distributed network infrastructure?" Uh... ok, I can intelligently answer that on a broad level but I'm not a network engineer. Having done hundreds of interviews at these companies, however, I can tell you that questions way outside of your expertise are meant to test your general engineering strengths, and your reaction under pressure. You really can't prepare for them. As long as you give reasonably intelligent answers (and always say "I'll look it up" or "ask a coworker", or "I don't know" if you really don't; *never* make up nonsense), you'll do fine on these.
i just added one &gt;)
I think it's a mistake to want them to combine. Competition means they drive each other forward with new features. A monopoly would lead to stagnation.
Web app: mostly uses local content/manipulation (by local content I mean client side) Web page: fetch/manipulates data from the server I understand it like that, I'm just starting in webdev though
It would be best if you didn't try to consider them in this way. The closest technical distinction you can make is that a web page has a distinct URI. They aren't mutually exclusive things. This means that: * A web *site* may have many different web *pages* and *apps*. * A web *page* may play host to a web *app*. * A web *app* may also be spread over many web *pages*.

Web pages are just an interface. An app provides actual functionality. A page is just an interface to an app, and an app does not need necessarily need an interface in order to function. IMO. 
hastebin just sucks, why is there such a low contrast between background and text ? the code can't even be executed the syntax highlight is using scala ???? and the indenting is horrible, tabs in a browser editor, really ? I got it to work on jsFiddle, way more functional. There's an infinite loop caused by the fact message is constantly overwritten. You can fix it by applying the replace() to a copy of the var `message`instead output = message; while( pattern.exec .... ) { if( blah ) { output = output.replace( .... ) } } message = output; 
They sometimes disappear when you use longer intervals. Maybe try cron jobs instead 
Could you explain the benefits,please?
I generally take it in good humour. But then again, I _may_ troll you with a weird ass solution. I'd probably tell you beforehand that I'm about to troll you, and offer the option of not doing that. I generally take it as an opportunity to build some complicity with the interviewer and, sometimes, deviate the progress of the interview to make it more interesting/entertaining. As someone who has also been on both sides... anything that makes it less boring is a good thing.
Web pages may contain web apps and web apps are almost always on a web page. I believe the web page to be a colloquialism to solidify the concept of internet media being like pages in an article. With the integration and widespread allowance of interactivity and security convergences the web pages revealed new tricks like the ability to author dynamic information. If these interactive tricks are the primary design handling the content on your page it wouldn't be wrong to call it an app.
On a side note, what do you use to keep upto date with JavaScript?
If the company is a smaller gig, then I usually find that they might actually really try to sell the job to you as they suffer finding good candidates. Watch out for common pitfalls of working for such a company. Try to figure out why they need you, try to understand their problems by asking and try to identify if you actually want this job. A senior title is worth nothing if you are in a tiny poorly organised sweat shop with no portfolio to show for it at the end. Try to understand the warning signs such as high staff churn or client churn. I always asked why they actually don't promote internally. They can have valid reasons but if they have a disparate team with no trust in anyone being able to do their job without decent guidance, then you might have huge political in-fights in your hands prior to actually doing your job. 
Isn't `async` what you are looking for ? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function
s p a m m a i l s son! 
Think about the difference between a website such as your favourite blog, compared to a native mobile application like a banking app, or a productivity app like Evernote. A web application is more or less meant to provide the same app-like functionality as a native one. The difference is that it uses the web as its platform as opposed to Android or IOS. Obviously this is just a simplification and there’s a lot more to it. A website is usually just for consuming content and requires little interaction from the user besides perhaps commenting on a blog post or searching for specific content. 
Are you using it in the browser or node ?
Thank you so much for this.
Multiple threads
I gave a thought to that. I agree that the tests should test only execution and only through public interface. As refactoring doesn't change the behavior of the code, it seems to be impossible to test it through behavior. Another option is spying on functions. That seems to be impossible unless I make these functions public, which violates another concern of not having good justification for making these things public. So, it seems that I have two options: - parse the code, just make it much less rigid and opinionated than it is right now. For example: check that source of "simple greet" has "Hello" only once, and check that source has only two string literals. Now that does force the user to remove duplication, but they are free to choose a method of doing that and naming. - inject custom code into the file before executing tests, that will make private things - public. Then spy on these. That seems like it is going to restrict the naming still. What do you think? 
jQuery is the perfect way to start learning about DOM manipulation and making something "cool" when you're just getting started.
You are already helping a lot! Thank you! 
FreecodeCamp, you are welcome and they are awesome.
No it isn’t. The perfect way is to use vanilla js and css transitions. Loading a 200kb library simply to write $(‘#myDiv’) instead of document.querySelector(‘#myDiv’) is stupid and bad practice. New developers are learning they don’t have to learn: just pull in another library!
Is the code open source?
My constructive input is to stop using jQuery. Yes, there is something wrong with using it: it’s an unnecessary library. Prior to ES6 and less-compliant browsers, yes, jQuery was amazing. But now it’s pointless. The only reason people still use jQuery is because their favorite library is written in jQuery and other jQuery fan boys keep writing shit in jQuery. Let’s push the web forward and stop clinging to the God damned jQuery.
I can provide you with some selections... Beginner - Web: Codecademy, FreeCodeCamp Book: Headfirst: JavaScript Programming Book: Beginning JavaScript Intermediate: Web: FreeCode Camp Book: Professional JavaScript for Web Developers Book: You Don't Know JS More Advanced: Book: Eloquent JavaScript Book: Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja Misc: Jon Duckett's JavaScript &amp; jQuery You didn't specify anything about your background, or for what purpose you wanted to learn JavaScript, so I just took a stab at it. I assumed you had no coding background, nor math familiarity and wanted to learn JavaScript as used mostly in the web browser. Of course, you can go further than this, but you should have a good handle on basic JavaScript if you go through this stuff. There will also be some redundant information across the sources, but practice is always good. I'm sure I missed a few good things, and I'm sure some will disagree with how I categorized the material, but I think this is pretty close to the difficulty curve when coming from scratch.
So yesterday on Friday 2018-03-02 the **[AI Mind](http://ai.neocities.org/MsIeAi.html)** in **[JavaScript](http://github.com/BuildingXwithJS/proposals/issues/22)** for MSIE began to approach **[Artificial Consciousness](http://medium.com/p/4241750b5224)**. 
Good to know. Thanks!
That would be like Stack overflow being completely open source. I don't think the project would benefit from being open source.
You'll get a lot of spam bots anyway. There is no way to keep your email secret forever. Best protection is a spam filter.
Features, bugs patched. Performance improvements.. I mean it’d be nice. 
Very clever

Twitter is pretty good, following all the thought leader types. 
I wouldn't consider it a hack because it doesn't rely on any behavior that is strange or outside of the specification. All it's doing is selectively changing visibility through peer selectors. There are no pseudo elements involved and not sure how you "abuse" a tag, but it's all very simple. I do think it's unnecessarily clever. I agree that cleverness or conciseness is not the best criteria for writing code. But it's not "a disaster" ... I saw your comment and was expecting some gargantuan mess of markup, not something so focused.
Wrong. Best protection is a catch-all email. I have one email address for every account I have. So, if one of those emails leaks, I can know who messed up and then block that email forever.
How do you know you're intermediate? In your opinion?
Nah, for a company it would be hell. Features is suddenly something they can't easily decide on, because somebody would just program it anyway and submit a pull request. Then they end up with an angry user when it's rejected. Instead of focussing on their project, they suddenly have a community they need to manage as well. Open source makes sense for a lot of things, but not for products owned/created by one company.
A web page can be just a (empty) room, a web app is a room with a purpose and function (ex. your home office). 
While they definitely won't actually combine, they could compromise to share the same typedefs. Basically, if flow recognizes the .d.js file endings then declarations will largely work for both. Unfortunately, Microsoft won't be putting any effort towards this and may try to hinder flow's progress towards such a goal. VsCode's js grammer intentionally doesn't support flow typecasting, TS still enforces file extension shenanigans, etc
https://vanillajstoolkit.com
seems a bit excessive no?
If you have some computationally heavy code, you can move that code to a background worker (thread). So your main web page stays free and responsive to user actions while your code is being run in a background thread. 
In my opinion... a web page is a non-JavaScript driven website, an example would be a typical small businesses website. Something that’s there for people to see and find their information. It would only be progressively enhanced with JavaScript. A web app is a JavaScript driven application that wouldn’t function, a user couldn’t use, without having JS enabled.
Not my idea, but what I envisioned when I saw that was the ability for each user to curate a "deck". (Probably more than one) Let others vote on them if they find them useful. This would allow the creation of both personal decks of things you want to learn, and widely used curated decks for those beginning new journeys into a specific language, methodology, tool, or just programming in general. After selecting a set of terms and saving them, you can "play". The site displays each term from the deck in random order. The user clicks either, "I remember" or "I forgot". Either way, the definition is then shown. After all cards are shown, an option to replay the ones marked as forgotten is presented. After that, a final result is displayed with the percentage or count that the user remembered. Maybe also with a total time. I don't think scores should be saved or publicly displayed, as the objective is learning not competition/widget acquisition. Also if a deck is edited after a user completed it, it would render the record/reward relatively meaningless anyway. 
&gt; After being on the interviewer side, I pretty much stopped being offended by softball questions when being interviewed. And I think this is really important going in to a Sr. Dev position. If a candidate can't understand why a business may want to do something like asking candidates to complete fizzbuzz, I'd argue the candidate may not actually be qualified for the Senior position. &gt; "My boss makes me ask that" I'm not sure blaming your boss is going to accomplish anything useful. I'd probably go more along the lines of "Perfect. You can code. Let's talk about some of what you've accomplished in your previous jobs." Otherwise, agreed all around.
its it not a bitch to have to manage all the different accounts?
I like to think of it like this: - when you go to a webpage, you likely see the same content as anybody else who goes to that page. - when you go to a web app, you see something that is unique to you as a user, or you are actively using the site as a tool.
Exactly. None of the scenarios I mentioned are necessarily deal breakers, it's just another data point.
Yeah, I intend the "My boss makes me ask that" thing to come off kind of tongue in cheek, I guess that doesn't convey well in text. 
I don't really like that categorization, so I've actually switched up my labeling. I don't think there's a good answer for that question. In my mind, you're either an absolute beginner (First 6 months? This is really relative!) or some other rung of a very long ladder.
oh cool, so when you sign up to say reddit, you do it as reddit@mydomain.com, but youractualemail@mydomain.com is only used with trusted sources and if reddit ever does send you spam, you'll never see it because its sent to the catch all?
I still consider myself a beginner.
ah apologies, sorry didn't realise. So would it be ok to post it on that sub channel?
I'm going to look into this, thank you so much for taking the time to explain this to me, I really appricaite it mate.
For Ecmascript developments, Axel Rauschmayer has a good blog (2ality.com). React/Vue stuff usually shows up here. Misc stuff usually shows up on Javascript Weekly. For web assembly you kinda need to do your own homework. For advanced stuff, I research. By advanced I mean things like what kinds of optimizations are effective under TurboFan, the state of various Rust-&gt;WASM toolchains wrt library development, novel approaches in framework design, that sort of stuff.
In short... Web page is static. Web app is interactive or provides info based on input. Website can host both. 
The definitions are so blurry and tech is transient, at best you can say a web app is a subset of conventional 'web page'. Nobody can draw a red line when a web page becomes a web app. So there is no difference. It's just a buzzword. Ignore.
best beginner resource: https://watchandcode.com The practical javascript section. 
For anything remotely complicated, I prefer to use for-of over reduce. E.g.: https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/7xngrh/refactoring_a_simple_loop_into_a_pipeline_in/dubgvm5/?context=3 I also generally prefer to use for-of over forEach. If all you need is an imperative loop, you shouldn't try to obfuscate it with forEach.
Just a heads up, there is a little typo in the &lt;title&gt;

Google it :D 
PropTypes predates flow or typescript really catching on in the mainstream. A lot of projects I've seen using PropTypes are older and really haven't run into an issue using PropTypes, so why fix it if it ain't broke. I'll be honest, having used flow in production. I'm a bit underwhelmed. I feel like there's a happy medium where it works really well. The problem is on small simple projects, it feels like overkill. Static typing is great, but it's not worth the set up time for a small project. On the other side, I found using it on a large to be a pain in the ass as well. It seemed like it would randomly decide to not play well with newer js features (Object.values immediately comes to mind) and you end up spending hours debugging just so you can commit your code. I don't want to sound like I'm bashing either of these languages, i just don't think either are silver bullets. PropTypes is still a very valid solution in my mind.

Follow this conversation. It explains. https://twitter.com/Dru89/status/969424253312364544
From an earlier response: &gt; I'm using Node/Express with Mongo, and handlebars/jQuery on the front end. The project isn't officially open-source (although, of course, the content is all community-generated), but the [code is on github](https://www.github.com/maximforever/dictionary).
As stated before, for JavaScript and Web Development FreeCode Camp is amazing. I still can't believe how much content they have for free and how often it is updated. I graduated from a bootcamp before I became a professional developer but I aced the entrance exam and bypassed a month of learning material from the bootcamp just from studying on FreeCode Camp. If you have the discipline to put in enough time and build projects I am 100% confident you could go from no programming experience to a professional developer if you wanted to. The only thing I would add is You-Don't-Know-JS. https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS This free series does such an awesome deep dive into Javascript, I highly recommend it.
This is something I've wanted to do for a long time, but every time I've gone to do it I found some reason not to. Partly, I was conscious that there was a good chance it would be terrible, and that was clearly a hard pill to swallow. But today I thought I'd just suck it up and get on with it. I'm going to start off by saying I'm not really happy with it. The audio isn't great, the editing's a bit shit, I couldn't find a way to end it that I was happy with, the intro jingle isn't exactly what I had in mind, and I'm not sure I sound great on the mic. I'm also not sure there are going to be enough interesting things happening in the JS community to make this at all interesting on a regular basis. Despite all of that, however, I'm glad I got it out there and I'd love to hear your honest feedback on it. I enjoyed making it and I hope I can do a few more and improve along the way.
What’s title? A class? An id?
A github search did not show much results with lots of stars. https://github.com/search?l=JavaScript&amp;o=desc&amp;q=css+javascript+minifier&amp;s=stars&amp;type=Repositories&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93 Notably, Butternut did not show up there and I'm wondering if there are others that don't show as well
For some reason it doesn't play in my mobile browsers (Android: Chrome or Brave browser). I hear this little chime (sorta 8bit like) sound and then silence I don't want to download this anchor FM app so I'll check it out again when I get to my laptop
Try http://javascript.info
That's strange. I don't really want to rely on Anchor tbh, they are just the new(ish) kids on the block who make recording and distribution a lot easier. Within 48 hours or so it should be available on iTunes, Overcast, etc, as is any other Podcast.
TypeScript PM here - we'd discussed collaboration in the `.d.ts`space with the Flow team a couple of years ago, but it sounded like it wasn't aligned with where they saw Flow going. Additionally, that doesn't have much to do with the grammar side of things, (having `.d.ts` as an extension isn't on its own a problem). So it's not like we tried to sabotage anything, this was a principled decision from the Flow team which we respect. What you are alluding to, though, is our own principled stance: we don't want to pretend that type annotations currently exist in plain `.js` files. However, clearly this is inconvenient for VS Code's Flow users, so the next release of VS Code will allow users to disable built-in extensions. Hopefully that'll make it easier for the Flow community to enjoy using VS Code.
I love this idea and I will subscribe. But one of the things that I like about podcasts is they feel more like a conversation than news. I was listening to your podcast and it felt a little bland and boring. Maybe a co-host or more conversational type of presentation? Maybe other subscribers like it the way it is, I don't know. Just my opinion. Anyways, I love the idea and I have subscribed to it.
My guess is the title tag: &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
Native loops are compatible with `yield` and `async`/`await`. They're also compatible with `break` and even labelled `break`s (in the rare circumstance when I want a labelled break) Your call stack will be simpler when you're debugging native control flow structures. I usually prefer them for those reasons. They're just simpler and allow me to use relatively fewer mechanisms to accomplish everything I need.
This may also work: $(document).attr("title", "New Title");

They're making the common mistake of await-ing asynchronous values before they're actually needed, turning what should be asynchronous code into synchronous code. const a = await $.get('a'); const b = await $.get('b'); console.log(a, b); should be const a = $.get('a'); const b = $.get('b'); console.log(await a, await b);

Any Idea why this doesn't work? https://codepen.io/timMellis/pen/xYeJzV?editors=1010 BTW both ways of doing the code that you guys have shown here, are from my perspective, genius, but do people usually use JQuery to do this? Both pieces of code showing how to do this are awesome but they are over my head. Is there a beginner way to do it that a newb could understand? Hopefully with some jsfiddle or a video.
This is a great idea, and I've wanted something like this for a long time. Are you recording with a laptop's built-in mic? That's what it sounds like. I think you really need to invest in some sort of external microphone. You can get these for really, really, cheap online. I was able to get one in a store for $5 last week. I can only imagine online would be a fraction. Sure you could invest upwards of 500 in a ribbon mic, but even a cheapie is going to make your sound quality exponentially better in a big way. You can use a headset or anything, perhaps even a phone (depends on your model), then transfer the file. You want something where the mic is pretty close to your face, and adjust the volume as needed. You want that 'open-air' (reverb) to be as minute as possible. A great trick to record audio is to do it in a vehicle. They are actually pretty soundproof, so it can be a bit like a little studio. For a 2 minute podcast, that would work great. Second, since your podcast is so short, I'm going to suggest you put a bed of music underneath your vocals. There are a lot of great stock options, but I'd avoid anything in GarageBand because all of those samples have been done to death. When mixing, you're going to want the music to be pretty low. The vocal audio should be crisp and totally intelligible over the music. Think of the music like an accent. You have to be very, very careful not to make the audio too loud. You don't need some fancy program to edit audio with, either. I've used Audacity on several professional projects so it will do just fine. For your purposes you would just need to load in the music track and the vocal track and adjust the volumes as needed. No need for any advanced EQ here, really. Again, those are just my suggestions. For an example of a similar program that does this sort of thing right, check out the StarDate radio show that is syndicated by NPR. A great example. Best of luck.
I really appreciate this, thank you for taking the time. Believe it or not I'm recording on a Blue Yeti, which I clearly have no idea how to use! I started off recording very close to the mic, which sounded good, but I ended up with a load of mouth sounds which were just awful. To counter that I wanted to move a bit further away from the mic, but may have gone overboard on that. I'm going to have to spend some time figuring out what works best I think. Any tips on places to find music I can legally use?
Correct
&gt;[–]tim246[S] 1 point 29 minutes ago* &gt;Any Idea why this doesn't work? https://codepen.io/timMellis/pen/xYeJzV?editors=1010 &gt;BTW both ways of doing the code by CertainPerformance and Geldan are from my perspective, genius, but do people usually use JQuery to do this? &gt;Both pieces of code showing how to do this are awesome but they are over my head. Is there a beginner way to do it that a newb could understand? Hopefully with some jsfiddle or a video. I'm maybe an intermediate to advance-newb but still a newb, like this-- "})();"-- is trouble for me. &gt;Any Idea why this doesn't work? `.bgImage` in your codepen is a div, not an img. &gt;Is there a beginner way to do it that a newb could understand? The plain Javascript way there *is* the beginner way... if you want to turn the IIFE into a plain function, you can, but I wanted to encapsulate the `imageIndex` because it's not something anything else in the script needs (as far as I know). &gt;but do people usually use JQuery to do this? Only if they don't understand how to do it in vanilla JS, which indicates they don't really understand what they should if they're writing a script... jquery is mostly unnecessary nowadays, thankfully. &gt;"})();"-- is trouble for me. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression IIFEs are one of JS's most powerful tools - with them, you can create a self-contained scope wherever you want.
With the caveat that your mileage will vary, with Angular(1.x at least) it's always been easy to just use it out of a CDN or download the nuget package and then everything just "works". Debugging is easy, IIS handles everything just fine. With React i've just found it a pain to integrate the webpack/npm ecosystem with the .net/VS ecosystem. Since with React you need more dependencies, you end up having to do more configuration up front. I end up having a separate project for the front end, manage the front end dependencies separately. Then, when working on it I have to run both the IIS back end from VS and a separate webpack dev server with a proxy to the IIS server. Then when deploying you have to make sure you get the right bundle out of webpack and point your IIS server to that. It's really not that bad once it's all set up, it's just that the upfront config is kind of a pain. It's really not React specific so much as modern front end specific, but with React you just have to set up more stuff manually. 
&gt;In before _name and _age are exposed to the public. I am writing primarily in TypeScript, so i can make the variables private, otherwise for JS it would require i wrote the class with ES5 syntax since ES6 classes don't allow private variables. I think the best solution to this is to use WeakMaps inside a module. &gt; new Person('John', 25); &gt; //"hello John, you are 50 years old" You mean 25?
Not sure what "opinion" you're asking for, exactly. I think the new context API probably helps solve/simplify some of the use cases where people "just" wanted to throw data around without prop-drilling all the way down, but that's only one use case for Redux (and not even Redux specifically, but rather React-Redux). I agree that people are encouraged to reach for Redux too early, but I also think many people dismiss Redux because they don't fully understand its benefits and how to use it (which is a never-ending problem I keep trying to clarify).
No, unfortunately I don't really have too much guidance there. There is quite a bit of free stuff out there though, if you do a google search for 'royalty free music'. But... a lot of the websites dedicated to royalty free music are not so great. Frequently they force you to register for access, load slowly, and generally behave in ways that are not very user-friendly. Luckily, you will only have to go through this process until you find something that you think fits your style, then you can just reuse the same music bed again and again. 
No `get age(){` is called when you deconstruct `age`, same happens with `JSON.stringify`
Check your browser's console for errors. My guess is that it has to do with Wordpress initializing jQuery in noconflict mode, meaning that instead of access jQuery via `$`, you will have to access it using `jQuery`. Unless Wordpress has changed this behavior recently, it was definitely a thing when I was using Wordpress. Try changing `$` to `jQuery` and see if that helps.
Tried both but got no luck. Any more suggestions?
That did it ! Thanks a lot !
Microsoft has done so many things right with TypeScript. Therefore, the assumption of SL4M_DunkN is inappropriate. As a developer and an user of TypeScript I would like to thank you for this great product.
Does it support syntax highlighting?
You are a legend! Thank you so much!
As long as both exist people like OP will feel they have to write definitions for both.
Such a definition is still too narrow, IMHO. The only definition they need is contained within how they relate to each other. At best, you could say a webpage is an electronic document of some kind -- but you cannot limit it to a specific language (computer or human), style, format, or even type of markup.
Setting root folder, importing other files which are not ts extension, export definition after transforming a typescript entry to javascript and many more. You can overcome those, but mostly in your `tsconfig.json`, not only you have to set everything twice, but the `tsconfig.json` has to be json and cannot be programmed (so importing the configuration from a common module is impossible). 
*Declarations* are not the same as *definitions*.
You can make a pop filter fairly easily, if it’s plosives that you were getting. Otherwise try being right up on your mic (within a few inches) and just don’t be as nervous :) Take a swallow of water and try to talk clean – you can always just say it again right after and pick the best one in editing. When you’re editing your own voice you are probably much more aware of squelchy mouth noises than anyone else.
No
A definition *is* an implementation. Perhaps you're thinking of declarations.
It isn't. The replies are from people who think that definition means declaration.
It's a toss-up between that and "Find Usages".
I couldn't find a RSS feed URL. Without one RSS feed you will severely restrict your addressable audience, as wouldn't be possible to subscribe in any other app than the one from the publishing platform. If the publishing platform you're using won't allow that, I would advise to find another as soon as possible. 
Just curious, would you consider a PDF served on an HTTP server a web page? What about a zip file retrieved via ftp? How about a REST API response returned to an iPhone app communicating with it's backend? I think these are all good counterexamples that, while technically documents sent over internet protocols, shouldn't be called web pages.
The distribution of the show is handled by Anchor. As this is the first episode it will take around 48 hours to get the appropriate feeds set up. Once that's done, it should be instant from then on.
&gt; How would you have prepared for Sr. JavaScript Engineer role at Netflix / Airbnb / Spotify? I'll let others point you toward resources for the more academic side of things, but I want to call something out: Every senior position I've interviewed for (frontend or backend), and the senior positions I interview candidates for, there is/was almost zero assessment of academic or advanced technical skills. What sinks enterprise projects is bad process, bad architecture, and unmaintable code. As a senior dev, the expectation isn't that you can pick the right data algorithm, it's that you can: 1. Architect the layer of the application you're responsible for from top to bottom with the appropriate tools. 2. Implement a code style guide and development process that leads to clean, maintainable code. 3. That you yourself know how to design code that makes it easy to understand and easy to maintain. 4. Know when to take on technical debt, and when to pay it off, and how to develop a plan to pay it off that doesn't affect the business release cycle. 5. Accurately assess risk and develop a gameplay for migrating to a new technology (maybe a framework version upgrade, or swapping out library X for Y). 6. If you're a tech lead, that you can actually lead other devs. 7. Take action items from retros and get them implemented - or knowing how to delegate if needed. 8. That your have the aptitude to truly understand the domain you're building. That you really understand the business case for it, and the specific use cases. Even if you won't have those responsibilities due to the fact that architecture and process may already be in place, a senior dev is still going to be expected to be the caretaker of such process and architecture, and must know how to correctly adapt it as needed. If the company is *truly* after a senior dev, they are going to ask you to describe examples of times you had to carry out some of those responsibilities, or give you hypotheticals to see how you might tackle certain challenges.

Then we iterate over another this which i assume it is related to the object created with the new method initializing the elements from 1 to length &lt; 1 with second element in the global defined array. which is an empty string. ==== PART2 ==== image = new StringArray(10); creating a new array with a length of 10. we set the first index in the global array to 10 and initialize the other 9 elements in image to "". ===== THIRD ===== image[0] = _0x5490[2]; image[1] = _0x5490[3]; image[2] = _0x5490[2]; image[3] = _0x5490[3]; image[4] = _0x5490[2]; image[5] = _0x5490[3]; image[6] = _0x5490[2]; image[7] = _0x5490[3]; image[8] = _0x5490[3]; image[9] = _0x5490[3]; we initialize the last 9 element of image array the following two values in sequence: offsecphun1.gif 0 2 4 6 8 offsecphun2.png 1 3 5 7 9 ===== FOURTH +++++ This is where i started losing it var ran = 60 / image[_0x5490[0]]; var ran equals to 60 divided by image [first element in the global array ] the value of first element in the global array is 10. so this becomes 60/image[10]; it is out of the index, in some languages this will through an error. Why are they doing this? ==== FIFTH +++++ function _0x5491() { sillydate = new Date(); sillyvar = sillydate[_0x5490[4]](); sillyvar = Math[_0x5490[5]](sillyvar / ran); return (image[sillyvar]); }; The funcky MOnkey??? another function? first it is creating a date object which i guess contains the current date? then this variable? sillyvar it is treating silly date as an array. it find the value at index 4 of the global array and use it to index sillydate ???? then divides index 5 by [silly var/ran] ???? and returns image array of index sillryvar lol? i guess it is doing some random things just to pick one of the two images ??? but can't at all figure out the actual way it is happening. ======== Sixth ++++++++ The last of them function _0x5499(_0x4499) { var hmmmm = document.createElement('img'); hmmmm.src = '/' + _0x4499; document.body.appendChild(hmmmm); } var that is the result of creating an element of type img creating the image source hmmmm.src = '/' + _0x4499; _0x4499 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; who is this guy? it is the thing that is passed to the function .... the document body contains hmmmmmmmmmmm ======= Seventh ++++++++ last assignment document[_0x5490[8]](_0x5490[6] + _0x5491() + _0x5490[7]); document[write](&lt;img src=\' + [one of the two images] +\'&gt; ) Based on this the output of the script should be : &lt;img src=\offsecphun1.gif\&gt; OR &lt;img src=\offsecphun2.png\&gt; anyone who can help. i would be more than happy :) 
This is quite unreadable. Post to /r/learnjavascript instead, and paste it somewhere that doesn't annihilate the formatting.
Why is this blog post mixing shell command and template strings (presumably executed within the JS VM)? If you are executing raw shell commands in JS, there's no reason to use `\\` to escape new lines, just format like a normal multi-line template and then `cmd.replace('\n', '')` or whatever before you execute.
Open source works pretty well for GitLab (the libre/CE edition at least).
Yeah. I was wondering WTF happened. They ended up in promise hell because they used promises wrong...
It's shit. Go fuck yourself.
I think the reason why it's still relevant is because it is pretty prevalent in the React world.
[Render prop composer](https://github.com/mini-eggs/render-prop-composer) for both React and Preact. Probably been made before but oh well. It was fun to make.
E.g. I’ll write a function with bad patterns like lots of async side effects and no returns. And tell the candidate to solve a problem with that function, with a rule that they can’t edit that function. Forces them to solve the problem “the hard way” so I can watch them problem solve for an hour; which is more valuable than a “correct” solution. If they solve it quick, we talk about optimization and functional approaches. Everyone on my team is expected to write JS in a functional way, and candidates with solid FP understanding rank higher as well.
Yha! 2 billion dollars! (That should be enough!)
I really like this approach. I've always liked throwing mids into dev tools to debug something I've broken that they're not familiar with—like a fork of a TodoMVC app. Mostly looking for problem solving approaches, but knowing their way around the tools gets them bonus points. So using a bunch of logs doesn't take anything way, but throwing conditional breakpoints in, following call stacks, or using the async call stacks are great. 
For the API page I would, certainly. The other two, probably not, but a case could be made for the PDF or any other human-readable format that can be natively handled by a browser. Certainly saying that only screens ultimately created by an HTML rendering engine can be called web pages is too narrow of a definition, and that was the point of my response to you. The page can be in any format the browser can display, and so long as it's accessible at a fixed URL, i think it qualifies as a "page." It's not as though there is a rigorous technical definition for the term. The main point I was making is simply that thinking there is a difference between a page and an app is wrong in the sense that they are complimentary concepts, not mutually exclusive ones. The result served up by a URL isn't simply a web page *or* a web app -- it can almost certainly be considered a page, and it may well be an app or part of an app as well.
Prettier
Ah I see, I mistook your initial response to be aiming at an essential definition for each term. I agree with you and find it interesting to try to define what a web page is. Because apparently that's hard, which I hadn't really thought about before. Cheers
I'd recommend `Promise.all` so you get earlier termination if b throws an error before a resolves. (it's pedantic but hopefully helpful to those reading)
Made a [State Management] Library with filtering that's lighter than Redux.
Thanks for the kind and encouraging words!
Any collection of information from the user that is persisted in a database for later processing is the distinction between a page and an "app" in my book.
My code is way worse than yours but I'm a newb. How do I get the writing which is going to be the nav links onto the images? Later I might create a timer to change the images but I want to figure out how to change them by clicking on them. https://codepen.io/timMellis/pen/wyZZgO
You are going to be terrible. Like anything worth doing, it takes practice to get it right. Before you start announcing give yourself a few episodes to workout the kinks **and then** try to get it out there. You only have one chance at a first impression.
sad, I was able to do many freelance projects thanks to phantomjs. 
One drawback I can think of is it would be harder to use instanceof. ``` function Car() { const car = {}; car.position = 0; car.move = () =&gt; car.position++; return car; } const car = new Car(); console.log(car instanceof Car); // false ``` You would have to do: ``` Object.setPrototypeOf(car, Car.prototype); console.log(car instanceof Car); // true ```
Headless Chrome looks like a good alternative: https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome
You could use his way and still use the prototype correctly: function Car() { this.position = 0 this.move = () =&gt; this.position++ } Works as well (because of the fat arrow) To decrease usage of `this` you could also do `const car = this` at the top of the constructor and attach methods to the car to achieve the same thing. 
Puppeteer should be a fine replacement :-) 
Yes. That would work. But OP's friend didn't like the keyword `this` and doesn't want to use it, so I'm just stating a drawback of not using `this` to create instance properties. 
Not the biggest, but the first one you notice since it's the first line of every code you write
There's [a letter from another contributor](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1egB4CarmBN3HfntWJ7n1ETB-uDQBAwS5taPbKtxMloQ/mobilebasic). Sounds like there's some politics involved too. I guess It's possible we'll see a fork in the near future
&gt; an app does not necessarily need an interface in order to function a web app implies that it's using a browser as an interface &gt; An app provides actual functionality that's such a loosely defined target that it doesn't really get any closer to a definition
If you call someone's web app a web page it'll annoy them and they'll correct you, but not vise-versa.
&gt; Also a lot of repetition like this: I think this is a good example of when repetition is preferable to putting it in a function in the name of DRY. At the moment all three list elements are exactly the same, but this is something (in a real world app at least) that would probably change down the track. You could add parameters to the code as changes come in, to accommodate the differences, but you've got an increase in complexity - the function would end up being harder to read and change than just keeping the lines duplicated in the first place. At the moment, if you wanted to change all items to red (for example), it's very obvious what you need to do.
I'm not sad about this
Yes, the day headless Chrome was announced the guy already said he was dropping PhantomJS. Off topic: Anyone knows a good way to write test for react pages?
I think it's best for all involved, long term. We all need to switch to headless Chrome / puppeteer, and then write our tests so that they an also run on headless firefox (isn't there a headless IE-engine in the works too?) A project run by a couple of hobbyists will never be able to keep up with the pace of browser development. Having the browser vendors supplying headless versions of their browsers is the only sensible approach. It's amazing it lasted as much as it did, and thanks to everybody's hard work
People are lame and lives are complex. There isn't any need for the drama created by letters and tickets. IMHO if he didn't like the way something was run then it should have been forked much earlier. That's the point of open source, it's about the code not the process. I used Phantom JS once. It became obsolete pretty quick. Hopefully people who enjoyed working on it can continue under the new name.
It is great using in it in Travis CI, kinda bliss to set it up for testing. And it was in fact nicely documented. In case of headless chrome, I think they should try to get rid of those 'await' operators by wrapping the logic inside a constructor. 
That's no drawback in using `this` in a constructor. However, since that pattern avoid using any prototype methods why use a constructor at all? Just use plain function and object.
You right, i'm not talking about testing the db layer it self. I'm talking about how many tests (unit and integration) and code I have to write. The less is better =) What kind of feature Postgre is better than Mongo ? Postgre is better when making relations. With NoSQL, we can't do 'JOIN' etc... we have to implement it. Thus we have to test it. Actually we have to test something that is deeply in the DNA of Postgre. Borring, isnt'it ? When I write an api endpoint test i do : . def input, actualState . def expectedOutput, expectedState . Make a request('input/actual state') -&gt; expect('expectedOutput','expectedState') With Mongo i have a lot of unit-test to do like : is my join-table up to date (sync) with others ? At the end, Postgre is more 'testable' as I have to write less tests ^^ and reduce the number of bugs that I write. Cheers! 
Check out Enzyme for shallow rendering in react. Depending on your test framework there should be some JSX matchers you can use for thorough testing. Can also do component lifecycle testing through the same method. It’s a great tool. 
If you're having to use instanceof a lot you're probably doing something wrong. It's an indication of code smell.
I followed a lot of tutorials here: https://www.turbo360.co/tutorials. Perhaps your questions have answere here. By the way , those tutorials are mostly Node JS based projects so Javascript was heavily emphasized.
Exactly, ever since the new arrow syntax came in with implicit _this_ binding I've started to embrace _this_ again. The original design of _this_ was a huge hindrance to JS but we've put new methods in place to mitigate it now.
No. It is powerful and subtle, but that doesn't make it bad any more than sharpness makes a chisel bad just because you can *also* use it to cut your hand open. The lack of default binding is an inconvenience, but that's why we have .bind() and fat-arrow functions, and the ability to bind functions to different contexts *at all* is very, very useful indeed upon occasion.

You can still do that within the constructor function itself ( and also set car.constructor to Car ). That's basically what ES6 does with its unnecessary class/extends syntax sugar and its out of place named/copied design patterns.
Yes
I think it's only looked down upon in functional programming, because unlike and method argument it is sort of a state of the function. That being said, you could easily change it to be just another argument called context, it's a bit more clear and readable, because with thulis, you might not know what it actually is (see .bind, .apply and .call)
I don't understand this line of thinking, if a dev doesn't know what "this" references then either the code is a monstrosity or he lacks OO understanding?
When people talk about the same thing they may not be talking about the same thing at all. Explanation of that seemingly strange sentence: In discussions such as this one it always is about individual examples where everything is obvious to everyone who has the basic knowledge. In real life you are working with thousands of lines of code, a huge backlog of issue to work on, time pressure to solve a given issue, etc. The problem is *statistical*: Don't look at individual examples! Look at what happens when the same thing happens in a noisy environment thousands of times, every day. You *can* see a difference not on a case-by-case basis (looking at individual examples - meaningless!) but in *"statistical space"*.
If his friend hates `this`, he wouldn't be able to take advantage of OOP, and his skill would be crippled if he use C++ OOP, because he'll also hate `self`.
Lmao? I've worked on countless codebases and I guarantee even small services of those codebases are much bigger than anything you have or ever will touch. Fuck off kid
Lol I love how the one person is so transparent and the other one is doing so much sneaky shit and obviously not being honest, and then gets upset over it when it's out there. 
There is probably no other way aside from reading the JS file directly and since it’s probably uglified/minified, it wouldn’t be readable. 
There are a few tricks you learn with time - e. g. what I usually do is search through all loaded source files using the ID of the element I click on (Ctrl + Shift + F in the sources window in Chrome Dev Tools), which is usually a good starting point. But frameworks like React or Vue make this a lot more difficult.
No... it's the prevelent usage of 'this' from other object oriented language making is hard to understand. I believe future programmers who learn JavaScript as their first Language will find this in Java or C++ equally bad
While true that doesn't change the fact that you need to spend time to refactor stuff for barely any change whatsoever. Businesses won't like it if you spend time on something that doesn't benefit them
Developer tools console has element inspection for this. 
You just have to remember fat arrows can break inheritance, because `this` is scoped to declaration, not instance. I work with Backbone, which makes extensive use of `this` and prototypal inheritance. As we introduce ES6, I'm already prepared to run into errors cause by people learning that you can use fat arrows *within* functions on the object, but not *as* functions on the object.
I don't necessarily think `this` is inherently bad itself, I just think it's context specific nature in Javascript makes it hard to understand, and thats why people may shy away from it. Maybe that makes it bad by design, but I don't think it qualifies as "bad" programming if you decide to use it.
It's not that *this* is bad; it simply has two downsides: * It is completely contextual, so you need to know what you should expect *this* to be before you use it * Because of the context dependency, it makes code harder to refactor As a general rule,if using *this* for any sort of structure or global state, it's better with explicit management. For example, React components inherit this.state and this.setState(), and these provide both convenient references and some control over when/how updates occur. Even this isn't perfect - if you move code between two components, you then need to figure out how to decouple/move state chunks. It's best to come up with some convention to how you use it and document that, and comment if/when you deviate. (While 'this *this* should be documented' is theoretically a code smell, it's also a kindness to your future self or someone else.)
&gt;(isn't there a headless IE-engine in the works too?) I'd say go for headless Edge since most people will be using that instead now. And lets also not forget Safari. This should also be made so that it can be done on Windows too, but unfortunately Apple stopped supporting Windows which makes it difficult (and from experience I know that most companies use Windows-servers for many of the test work)
Use monitorEvents(object, "click") in Chrome console.
So whenever starting a new project, what is currently some recommended build tools right now? What with what to achieve what?
Second
I am not that experienced in JS but I use to read about the ecma standards and all the new JS stuff. I use "this" a lot at my work... If it's not right then what's the alternative. please enlighten me 
Try using getEventListeners($0, "click") in Chrome console. $0 is the element that is currently selected in the Element tab.
There is nothing special about `this` for chaining. You return the context object (the one with the methods) in whatever form, you don't need it to have the special name "this".
Switching between Java and Javascript is a bit dangerous, because `this` means similar but different things.
You’re not going to find a single all encompassing library for that. You’re probably going to have to use a mishmash of different libs. What do you want this for?
Back buttons don’t work as expected on iOS Chrome. 
How do they break inheritance could you give an example?
What is this? ES6? I really don't like this "=&gt;" and what's "new"? It's all very confusing as I have just started to learn the "Normal" js syntax and now this is ruining everything for me.. #halp
No thanks, I prefer MDN Web Docs.
No I was looking JavaScript
Problem with `this` exists only in JavaScript, using `that` is an ugly workaround that put in question need of OO paradigm in JS. You can be just fine using only closure. I am not sure, but i think using closure may cause potential memory leaks.
Hey if you are looking for someone to help you through the basics of learning, I would be happy to help. I’ve been learning for just over a year, and still consider myself as a “learner” be prepared to spend time learning and solving challenges. If you want to learn it over night, unfortunately it’s a bigger learning curve than that. Do you have any experience with HTML and CSS?
See also /r/learnjavascript 
Ah. In that case, you're in the right place. I'd say start off with something like Codecademy (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript). It's not really a comprehensive teaching resource or anything like that, but it'll give you a feel for syntax. After that, start on freeCodeCamp. I know you said you wanted to learn JavaScript, but this will also help you learn HTML and CSS, which are crucial for any front-end developer work. (https://www.freecodecamp.org/) If you decide you hate that, you can also check out beginner JavaScript courses on Udemy. They're about $10 each, if they're on sale. Those will definitely get you started.

Alright thank you, I will get on that actually right now 
I don't think so. Seems like the project hasn't resources to compete with headless Chrome or Firefox. 2-3 devs is literally not enough.
Also [this github issue](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/15345). 
I started with C++ at my school. It was a pain at first but so worth it. Learning C++ gave me a solid foundation into programming. Once I decided to start learning JavaScript and in general front end, I heavily relied on that C++ knowledge. It made learning JavaScript, shell scripting, Python, &amp; in general any other language so much easier to pick up. JavaScript is a quirky language. In my opinion, jumping into JavaScript as your first language to learn fundamental programming concepts isn’t ideal. I used Xcode to write C++. It forced me to learn good coding habits. I learned about classes, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, pointers, heap/stack, linked lists, &amp; so much more. 
Ooo! I've been looking for a good iOS HN client. This looks awesome from the screenshots. Thanks for a detailed CONTRIBUTING. A slight point of confusion is that it mentions committing both `yarn.lock` and `npm-lock.json`, despite the repo only containing the latter, and the instructions in the README recommending npm. Thank you also for the detailed list of features and todos. At what point do you think you'll publish to the App Store? Once every one of those is done?
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn
Just a click bait article. Very bad written. 
On top of this, I highly recommend Jest. 
In JavaScript, this depends on the context in which the function was called. In C++, is it always clear what self refers to? i.e. the object. 
All very good advice! I learned Javascript (~4) decades ago with a Dummies book! Such better resources today and so accessible. Start slow and if you don't get something, do it until you get it. Don't be afraid to ask for help. Happy coding! 
'this' allows for a much nicer syntax though with 'this' arr.map(fn1) .filter(fn2) .forEach(fn3) without 'this' adapterFns .map(fn2,arr) .filter(fn2,arr) .forEach(fn3, arr)
[Head First HTML5 Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-HTML5-Programming-JavaScript/dp/1449390544) is a very visual book with a ton of review and quizzing and uses practical examples to teach Javascript, it's a little dated at this point, but a really great resource for book learners . [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101) spends a lot of time in the beginning on teaching helpful tooling that a lot of other learning resources leave out, like git, developer tools, debugging and testing, it takes a little while to get to the Javascript part, but everything before that ends up being very useful . Brad Traversy's [Modern Javascript from the beginning](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning) Udemy course is a fantastic and thorough introduction to Javascript . Javascript has seen a lot of cool updates in the past few years, and this is one of the only courses that starts out with the "modern" approach, so you don't end up having to relearn a bunch of things . A great course for video learners . [Practical Javascript](https://watchandcode.com/),A great course that teaches entry level javascript with practical examples that build on top of each other to form a full project . The paid subscription is a fantastic course that goes into a lot of important subjects often skipped in other courses, but can at times be very boring . Other resources you're likely to be referred to the I somewhat disagree with Free Code Camp &amp; Codecademy, if you were instead learning to draw, the teaching methods of these courses would be the equivalent of tracing pictures you liked . Free Code Camp has a really great and helpful community built around it though . You don't know Javascript &amp; Eloquent Javascript really are some great books and deserve their praise, they're just not the friendliest introductions to Javascript if it's you don't already have some knowledge of Javascript or other programming languages . Javascript &amp; jQuery by Jon Ducket, this book is fine, but I just don't feel it's as good of an introduction as any of The Head First books, while still being just as dated. It is a lot more comprehensive though, but it doesn't build to a project, use as practical of examples or do as much hand holding . 
There are different ways, I agree. It's not always the same object either, sometimes it's completely destroyed and recreated within the method. The point I was making is each method gets it's own context. With prototyping, the context is known by each method in the prototype. It starts with "this". Before ES6 classes were constructor factories. "this" is simply "this object", or as you said, the context.
However if he were to use C# everything would be fine, as it allows `this` to be ommited in pretty much all cases except for when you're setting a variable to a parameter of the same name
PhantomJS is An amazing project that changed the way that we interact with JavaScript from a scripting perspective and made writing integration tests in JavaScript meaningful. Awesome job to the team that made it. That said, I want my tests to run on current browser code paths and Phantom doesn’t support much of ES5. I also need my tests to run on Linux variants so I can run Continuous Integration. The Chrome team has done a great job in achieving both of these. 
I know. I didn't think of that constructor pattern. Just copying over what the OP wrote in his post. 
That's like saying switching between Danish and Swedish is dangerous because `kuk` means differnet things
Do you have an example of why using `instanceof` indicates code smell? Don't even have to use `instanceof` a lot. Just using `instanceof` comparing `car` to `Car` once would produce a `false`, and it's not immediately obvious to everyone why it would produce `false`. 
`That's no drawback in using this in a constructor.` That's not what I was saying. I was saying the opposite. It's a drawback NOT using `this` in a constructor. 
There are many articles about it, it's not unique to JavaScript: http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=31 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7526817/use-of-instance-of-in-java
I think it's important that anyone who depends on using PhantomJS (including projects that directly package PhantomJS and/or bindings for other languages) should stop and think for a minute before worrying about this too much. First of all, PhantomJS is not trademarked (at least, it's not in the United States). I did a search in the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) TESS database, and no results were found. Second, PhantomJS is licensed under the three-clause BSD license. This is one of the least restrictive licenses possible; the only active burden we have to bear is that we provide original author attribution - see https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/blob/master/LICENSE.BSD Based on the above two points, there is **absolutely nothing** Ariya can do to prevent anyone from forking this project (even publically), calling it PhantomJS, and continuing to do development on it. The most Ariya can do is prevent contributions to **this repository** which he owns. And that's his right and privilege. I would suggest establishing an organization for any remaining interested PhantomJS contributors. There's no need to change the name, unless you want to disassociate the project from the phantomjs.org website (which we won't be able to get control of unless Ariya voluntarily gives it over). You could just put a note in your project's readme.me saying "This is the *maintained* version of PhantomJS" and have a github.io website for it instead of phantomjs.org. In short, nothing is really changing except that the repository location will be moving. When there's interpersonal drama, open source routes around the damage. /shrug Of course, since there are so few contributors to PhantomJS, losing one who's actively able to contribute and technically competent like pixiuPL could actually bring the project to a near-halt. The problem with PhantomJS was never a lack of interest; it was that the codebase is inherently hard to understand for the *users* of PhantomJS, most of whom only know JavaScript (or not even that much). C++ knowledge + web dev or testing interest is not a common skill cross-section.
Past phantomjs releases aren't going to disappear overnight
So long PhantomJS, you were an important stopgap measure for many of us for several years.
I'd say it's more like having a building collapse because you ordered the wrong kind of concrete.
pixiupl sounds like a petulant child. Some times I don't understand how professionals like this could act in such a manor. What a joke. 
The right place for websockets and other persistent connections in a Redux app is in a middleware. That way, they can react to dispatched actions by sending messages, and turn received messages into actions. There's actually many existing websocket middlewares already. You can use them directly, or learn from them as inspiration. See the [Middleware - Sockets and Adapters](https://github.com/markerikson/redux-ecosystem-links/blob/master/middleware-sockets-adapters.md) section of my [Redux addons catalog](https://github.com/markerikson/redux-ecosystem-links) for a list.
An unsubstantiated assertion on SO isn't an example. The first example is an example in Java and includes a quote about not using `instanceof` in C++. Neither the article nor the quote actually explain *why* `instanceof` is bad. Both Java and C++ are statically and strongly-typed, class-based languages, so I'm not sure if the same considerations come into play on a dynamically and weakly-typed, prototype-based language. They may; they may not. There's not enough information in either the article or the SO answer to say.
You can't call `super.move()`
If you have an asynch call that depends on an asynch call that depends on an asynch call that depends... maybe you should think about what the hell you are doing. 
I'm not too crazy about using arrow functions for methods. Previously if I ever saw: el.onclick = this.move I'd be pretty sure it was a problem. Now I have to stop to think whether it was intentional or a mistake.
The limitation in C# is you can't use methods as first class functions.
&gt; I'm sorry this project has not gained much traction. It has gained a lot of traction. It's not being deprecated because people wouldn't be using it. It's being deprecated because puppeteer is so much better and faster. At least that's how I understand it.
Chrome developer tools can check this and prettify minified source code. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18877190/chrome-debugging-break-on-next-click-event
The best way to view `this` is as a Python person who has to pass __SELF__ to everything. You can do that too in JS, you can pass a copy of an object to itself every time you want to work with it introspectively.
beautify is a thing
What individual libraries are out there?
I think `this` is only genuinely useful for OO-style polymorphism and prototype optimizations. If people are resorting to arrow function properties to avoid dynamic binding problems then that advantage goes away. I'd rather use a closure then. Of course you often *can't* because so many of the libraries we use (Angular, React) demand that we extend their base classes.
Your build server doesn't have to be able to connect to Google or even anything...
_this_ has nothing to do with chaining. function adapterFn(input) { let values=[...input] function map(fn) { values=values.map(fn) return module; } function filter(fn) { values=values.filter(fn) return module; } function forEach(fn) { values.forEach(fn) return module; } var module = { map, filter, forEach } return module; } 
You’re trying to do this from the browser, correct? httpOnly is a flag sent from server to client, which the browser sets to prevent client access via JS to the contents of the cookie. 
No, that's the javascript from client.
Being able to create a cookie with httpOnly in JS would be weird me: "Cookie created, time to use it" browser: "what cookie"
You can use this in a semantic sense as well, look at Vue. Vue doesn't require use of classes or anything of the sort. Instead this refers to the component you're working on. The current _context_ of execution. I think everyone sees this used with prototypes and often miss the bigger picture of execution context. There's a lot of power in the flexibility to compose and manipulate functions during execution. This helps with that (pun not intended).
The new stuff is fantastic. Take a day or two playing around with it, and you'll come to appreciate it. 
Yes, you *can* use `this` in that way. I use Mithril and it supports POJO, class and closure style components. Having closures means I really never need to use `this` in stateful components at all. function component() { let count = 0 function increment() {count += 1} return { view: () =&gt; m('button', {onclick: increment}, 'Increment') } } 
Hmm, that's my another concern. Even I can create it, I won't be able to use it in the future. So, I make a request to a server from my nodejs server and is it possible to set this cookie from nodejs server for my client?

Yes, any general-purpose plotting tools won't have stock data already available, you'd have to get that somewhere and import it. 
You could try emailing them and ask how it was done.

Debugging like a pro... Debugging using only console log statements... Pick one. 
It's [not a problem](https://github.com/googlehosts/hosts). I'd be not surprised if Google [does the same shit](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12016011) for Chrome.
That’s right. It’s a useful tool to prevent phishing/ session hijacking ... user logs in, server stores an httpOnly-flagged session that the server authenticates the user via that cookie on subsequent requests. Without scripting access, evil script-kiddies can’t touch the contents of the cookie. There are other prevention measures, this is but one. Did you have another purpose for it? 
Yeah I wasn't bashing or anything, don't see the reason behind the downvotes. Just expressing my anxiety with new syntax being introduced, while I'm still learning the fundamental one. Of course I welcome and embrace changes and improvements. It's a lot to take in at once. So, yeah I'll get there eventually. In the meantime I'll use this as a smiley face =&gt;
Isn't it more readable to use back ticks instead of string substitutions?
Found this pattern to be very useful in some cases. Looks weird at first, but it actually reduces the codebase quite a bit. 
Yeah I was kind of wondering the same thing...
Okay, I wonder if learning code is a bit like this: first you suck. There is a ton to know. You create some stuff which isn't very good. People help like you are doing... We know our code isn't very good but at least we wrote and understand it. We want to finish rather than give up. Another example is, if a child learning to write creates a short story and he is stuck, not focusing on his problem and telling him his gerunds are confusing and bad practice may be off putting. I know my code sucks, but my window is way way way narrower than yours. It's like learning to ski. The guys on the bunny hill suck but they can't just go on the black diamond runs and be awesome. It's impossible. In other words, if an awesome skier says: "just ski this run like me..." The guy obviously can't do it. He'll probably feel ashamed. I do appreciate your help. I guess I should start over so my code doesn't suck. Does the little boy fix the gerunds or does he figure he is too stupid and feel ashamed that his story is laughable garbage?
This is a CSS question, not JavaScript.
Nobody said E2E testing. Else you would go with selenium/cucumber
it's preferable to not have to box the input for both practical and stylistic purposes. it looks nicer not boxing the input, and what if you want to chain non-native functions with native ones? It wouldn't be possible without 'this' ex. arr.filter(fn1) .map(fn2) .customAdaptor(fn3) // custom adaptor made possible with 'this' 
&gt; It's like learning to ski. The guys on the bunny hill suck but they can't just go on the black diamond runs and be awesome. It's impossible. Not at all, the things I suggested are super easy to accomplish: (1) change the image URL to something that doesn't 404 (if you don't do that first, how do you expect people to be able to interact with your script) (2) select the desired element you want to add a click listener to, then .addEventListener('click', myFunction) This isn't expert-level stuff, it's beginner-level stuff that takes less than 30 seconds to fix...
&gt; This isn't about debugging, this is about the available methods of the console object. Blah. It's showcasing useful tools for the purpose of *debugging* your code. If getting output is defined only as "logging", and not debugging, then your assertion is that debugging doesn't exist because *everything* is logging...
`onSuccess('9306b17620c51cc44b3c919...` If the number of minutes is refreshed, the easiest thing to do would probably be to scrape the page text directly if the response can't be easily parsed
It looks like what they're doing is using the Google Maps API with a custom pin image. The ping call doesn't get a number of minutes; it gets a new image to update the map. Scraping the page won't work (without some kind of OCR) because it's an image, not text.
Really? I said that because I saw this: &lt;img class="E0MQPE-d-b" role="button" tabindex="0" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw ... =" aria-label="Estimated wait 0 Minutes" alt="Estimated wait 0 Minutes" style="width: 108px; height: 136.5px; cursor: pointer;"&gt;
While this pattern is definitely an improvement over having multiple parameters, I think it's important to think very hard before using it since a function that receives boolean configuration parameters is bad design to begin with and should be avoided as much as possible.
Um no, I don't think all debugging is logging? For example, reading a suspected line of code would be debugging but not logging, the same with adding a debugger and executing code in the console. Nor is all logging, debugging. Look at all the status updates you get when you do any `npm` action in your terminal. Those are logs a developer is writing to communicate with the user, and they aren't always there to debug. &gt; It doesn't have to be any more or any less. That's correct, the article is about the `console` endpoint, so why is the title trying to state its about debugging? Regardless, the info is still useful and yes, using `console` is a valid tool when debugging, its just not your only tool.
If the alt text updates when the image does, then that would work. Won't know until the value changes. If that's the case, and assuming that funky looking class name isn't dynamically generated, then you could do document.getElementsByClassName("E0MQPE-d-b")[0].getAttribute("alt") to get the alt text. 
I thought querySelector is better when you only want to select a single element, and that element properties are preferable over getAttribute? (not that that wouldn't work, but seems odd to code)
I'd keep the browser open and write a userscript that uses MutationObserver.
That works too. I don't often have to mess with plain old javascript that doesn't include id attributes, so I don't mess with the helper methods very often. :)
Figured it out and it was really simple. All I had to do was in each Resource Java file change the @Get to @Get @Options @Get @Options public String represent() { GetWebAccessLogAction getWebAccessLogAction = new GetWebAccessLogAction(new WebAccessLogDAO()); JSONArray webAccessLogs = getWebAccessLogAction.getWebAccessLogs(); return webAccessLogs.toString(); }
Cool. Thanks for the quick help on this guys (gals?). Really appreciate the input.
&gt; using console is a valid tool when debugging, its just not your only tool. This is a direct contradiction of your first comment, and negates everything else you just said. In addition, where did you get the idea the console was your *only* tool? What made you say that? As you said, the console is a **debugging tool**. And this article is about using the console to debug code. If you agree the console is a debugging tool, then what's the problem?
chaining non-native functions with native is only possible by changing the array prototype - which is generally a bad idea. 'this' is just an implementation detail in this situation.
Why didn’t I know this stuff?
I think you are both right. Stack Overflow is a good example of this dilemma. On the Stack Overflow podcast, they frequently acknowledge that it is a pretty common occurrence for beginners to ask a question for the first time, only to have the question closed for reasons like "not a real question" or "off-topic". They are trying to reconcile the fact that while they must have rules and standards to maintain the integrity of their communities, many beginners are met with a frustrating experience because there was a problem with their question, so they never get an answer to that question. And worst case, they are totally discouraged by the experience and give up or never return to Stack Overflow. I agree that your suggestions are good ones, and that they are pretty easy to fix. It does also like this is more of a CSS question, not really JS related. It also seems like a frustrating experience for OP. Stick with it OP. Maybe try posting in /r/webdev?

Works for me on Android 8.0 (though the UI is quite broken) 
The console endpoint isn't a debugging tool, it's a communication tool. You use it to communicate information. Sometimes that is useful for debugging but its by no means the primary function of what the console endpoint can do, as this article pointed out. Why limit it to debugging? I see much more relevant uses to log data to a user using `console.table` than to use that method while I'm debugging. &gt; what's the problem? The subject of the article is fine, its title is misleading. I pointed that out. That's pretty much it.
I'm not totally clear on what you are asking, what do you mean by "two axis values"? I found a basic explanation of what `d3.bisector` does [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26882631/d3-what-is-a-bisector). I have some experience with d3 but not with this specific type of thing, but it seems like it's basically taking the current mouse position and using the `x` scale and the bisector function to figure out what value on the left domain fits the mouse position. Then it's just updating the x and y values of the svg dotted lines.

Just like the comment above it says it converts O.length to a 32 bit unsigned integer. The more common idiom for that would have been var len = O.length|0; Not sure why they did it that way.
So, once a bitwise operator completes, it doesn't convert it back to 64bit? I don't know why I was udner that impression, but I was. So this is for performance, to save memory space?
He didn't even mentioned the ```debugger```statement ONCE. This ain't debugging…
to hint at it being an integer for Js-VM optimization purposes? To deal with wonky objects where o.length is 2.115 or something?
It's getting the 2s compliment value of length, e.g. if `O.length` is -1, then `len` will be 4294967295 (2^32 - 1). This is the same as casting the signed value to an unsigned value. The comment mentions this, but I didn't look deeper to see *why* they're doing it. 
Isn't ```debugger``` a more useful tool for debugging than ```console.xyz```? It's a newbie writing an article misusing the word "pro" for clickbait, thats all.
https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/81z3et/javascript_debugging_like_a_pro/
&gt; it doesn't convert it back to 64bit? I think you have a misunderstanding. All numbers in javascript are 64 bits, but they are 64bit *floats* -- IEEE-754 floating point values. I think you are assuming that the value was or is a 64bit *integer*, but that isn't the case. The bitwise operators all operate on 32bit *integer* values however. This means that the statement `foo = bar &gt;&gt;&gt; x` first casts `bar` to a 32bit signed integer, and then the 0-fill shift casts that to a 32bit *unsigned* integer according to 2s-compliment rules. Afterwards, the result is stored back in a 64bit float, which is the only numeric format javascript actually has.

A template literal without an expression? Yes. \`${this.something}\` makes more sens. /s
I’ve been looking for a solution similar to this, and Raj ticks all of the boxes: Elm architecture, tiny size, no magic, still feels “javascript-y”. I used it for a simple exercise I like to do for testing out new frameworks. After a bit of tinkering and getting used to it, I am in love. I plan to work on something larger that would compose some raj apps to get a feel for that. Amazing work. Also, [tagmeme](https://github.com/andrejewski/tagmeme) is HOT. Really elegant. If you use redux, you should check it out for managing constants and reducer boilerplate. 
Well, yes, that's what I meant when I said it zeroes the 32 more significant bits. Not that "if it is larger than 2^(32) - 1, it will set it to 2^(32) -1", just that the operation always produces a result smaller than 2^(32). Now, why not use your proposed `Math.min`? Because zeroing the significant bits also has the effect of producing _positive_ numbers. That is, the result will always be in [0, 2^(32) - 1). Meanwhile, using `Math.min` _might_ produce a negative value, so you'd have to still do something more.
A length of -2 should iterate 4294967294 times, while a length of 4294967298 should iterate 2 times. Obviously. /heheeheh
&gt; This isn't about debugging, this is about the available methods of the console object. Who knew that being able to access information would be A WAY to debug? I mean, printing information to a console is only the oldest way of debugging any code. Your arguments over semantics seem childish. Logging is a form of debugging, if you think otherwise then it must suck to only catch syntax errors. 
Okay.
 const formatStr = (inputStr) =&gt; `(${inputStr.slice(0, 3)}) ${inputStr.slice(3, 6)}-${inputStr.slice(7)}`;
What I'm saying is logging doesn't make you a debugging pro like the title suggests.
one could attach a method to the instance, extend the prototype, or when the pipeline/bind proposal goes through we could do something like this //pipeline arr.filter(fn1) |&gt; ?this.customAdaptor(fn2) .map(fn3); // bind arr.filter(fn1) ::customAdaptor(fn2) .map(fn3)
It's a language feature. If you understand how it works, there's no problem. If it confuses you, you can avoid it. Also, the simple version of the factory pattern that _maintains_ `instanceof` is: function Car() { const car = this; car.position = 0; car.move = () =&gt; car.position++; return car; } let myCar = new Car();

If tools like console.log / trace / etc are not in your toolbox, I question your ability to debug like a pro. They are not the only tools in that toolbox, but important ones.

jquery widget factory? is that you?
So, how can I integrate this into the actual script? I apologize for being a complete noob. Any tutorials you could point me to? Thanks!
dont use an anonymous function, example: var print = function(arr, idx) { alert(arr[idx]) } for (i in somearray) setTimeout(function() { print(arr[idx]) }, 1000) or use bind var print = function(arr, idx) { alert(arr[idx]) } for (i in somearray) { newfn = oldfn.bind({}, arr, idx) setTimeout(newfn, 1000) } 
We've added a .hackterm &lt;term&gt; command to our IRC bot over on ##oodnet (freenode), it's a really useful thing to have. Nice work!
To go off of this... something I read recently said to only use loops when you know that you want to perform an action X amount of times. Use Array prototype methods otherwise
Cool... But for such a big title I honestly expected something more than just an incomplete list of `console` methods that you can find on MDN for example.
Oh my fucking god everyone is always simultaneously right and wrong on the internet forever
&gt;this.changeValue Better to avoid `this` when it isn't actually needed: simply save the btn reference with `let`, or iterate with the built-in iteration methods. Reselecting each element every time is definitely inelegant, as is a jquery wrapper without a purpose. (is `id` even a function?)
There's one use case where for of loops come in really handy, when you need to break out of the loop. Definitely a tool to keep in the pocket.

&gt; Is it really "toxic" for me to point out that your negative comment was ... negative? No, your assumption that any form of critique is negative is. I also don't think grown up people should be treated like raw eggs or children who will start to cry if someone raises the tone a little bit. We're all grown ups living in a world that is FULL of hate and if you can't even take a stranger that doesn't care about you feeling all cuddly ON THE INTERNET how are you supposed to take the shit thats going out there in the world? &gt; This is an article about using the console to debug JavaScript. The title states otherwise… &gt; There's literally NO ONE who's an old and crusty JavaScript developer using console.trace for the past 30 years. So what's the distinction between "newb" and "PRO"? Let's make an example. Take two persons, A and B, both who had their first experience with Javascript 2 years ago. A read some Javascript tutorials because he wanted to do some cool animations on his site, since then he uses it here and there when necessary and has no problem with just C&amp;P working solutions as long as it's gets the job done. B read the ECMA Specs, has a deep understanding of the language features and knows exactly why ```{} + {}``` results in ```NaN```, he experimented a lot with various language implementations and thereby very knows the surrounding tooling. A is a newb; B is a pro! Experience is defined by time invested, not time passed by… &gt; At one point, the best we had to go on for debugging were alert statements. "We didn't had nothing back then…" *yawn* &gt; Dating you from your rhetoric, I'm guessing you never had to experience that. I did, but I never considered myself a pro back then. &gt; But in that context, the existing console methods today ARE "pro" debugging methodologies. YOUR context is full of false assumptions and therefore invalid. And using pro logging methods just because you CAN use them for debugging doesn't make them pro debugging tools. &gt; There's absolutely no need, whatsoever, to belittle those who don't know about them as "newbs". It makes you small. No, you're the one who belittles these people by making the assumption that it's a bad thing to be a newbie. Everyone here was a newbie once and everyone of us got told by someone more than once, we're all still here. Beside of investing time in learning, thats another thing you need to do to get from newb to pro: Listen if you get told. There is nothing wrong with being a newbie. &gt; If getting output is defined only as "logging", and not debugging, then your assertion is that debugging doesn't exist because everything is logging... This statement is wrong. I told you so and even explained the difference between logging and debugging. You were wrong from the beginning and instead of just admitting that after you got told you started a handful other debates to distract from your mistake. Thats a trait of a [Permanewb](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Permanoob). Being a Permanewb *is* bad, don't be a permanewb. 
What is ofs?
I misread the use case you were commenting about, so it's tangential anyway. But I thought I'd mention it
The simplest solution would be to set a variable.... let curVal = arr[i]; outside of your set timeout call but inside the loop block, then console.log curVal instead.
If you want to make a page and run Javascript on it, I recommend using Webpack and webpack-dev-server.
For someone asking how to start writing code, throwing in webpack might not be the best idea. 
Wow...the things that people in OSS have to put up with. Someone shows up for 3 months, does some minor code shuffling and breaks stuff, and gets mad when the original maintainer doesn't move as fast as he wants.
seconding /u/naeramarth7 here. don't recommend webpack for an absolute beginner.
I'd recommend searching for "getting started with javascript" on youtube. You'll find quite a few tutorials that cover this.
Jsfiddle.net, codepen.io or simply HTML file on your desktop. 
 const ids = arr.map((x, i) =&gt; setTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(i), 1000)); 
Huh, didn't consider hoisting. Makes sense. I still don't really understand javascript's whole scope hierarchy. Thanks a bunch! The reason why i'm using a `for .. in` loop is because I'm actually iterating through an object's fields, not an array. And as far as I'm aware there's not a way to iterate through each field in an object without a for loop.
If you want to build webpages offline just open a text editor and create a .html file and put the JavaScript you write into a `&lt;script&gt;`tag. If you want to write and execute JavaScript code, check out [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) which will enable you to execute .js files in a browser environment. 
There's `object.keys`, or do you need to go up the prototype chain too? (and if you need to do that, that's a code smell)
If you want to write pure JavaScript, install Node.JS, then using NPM install Nodemon. Then you can run javascript files using nodemon and they'll output as if they were outputting to your console. Node does this on its own, but Nodemon will automatically run again each time you save the file you work again. If all that's confusing, its because it definitely is when you're just getting started. I'd follow the advice of other posters, and look at some youtube videos on how to get started with running JavaScript locally, and also watch some on how to run Nodemon.
Get a text editor like atom or visual studio code and look up tutorials on getting started
Thanks for reviewing the code, it was the first time I wrote an npm module with typescript. As for the critiques: - I created the promise method in the constructor because I feel it was easier to read the code by having a promise function declared in one place, then having it used it another place. - I wasn't aware of the Array.some function to test an array, I'll use it for sure!
Ooh, that `requiredParam` trick is great.
Thanks for the feedback! You are actually right, but I must say, what is the main usage for console? can you think of any other usage then debugging?
Having used these techniques for a while. Did not knew it was a design pattern, just common sense :)
Yeah, I agree. Seems like some shenanigans afoot.
Use below CSS. #nav { position: relative; /* uncomment below line if you want to restrict the image only on #nav area */ /* overflow: hidden; */ } #img { position: absolute; z-index: -1; width: 100%; height: 853px; } 
How stuff like this gets over 100 upvotes is beyond me. Literally the MDN console page rewritten. Not to mention the title is plain wrong
For the "btn is no longer btn" problem, wrap the code within the `for` loop in a function which is executed immediately. e.g. for(var i in c){ (function() { var btn = new menuButton(); var listener = function(e){ btn.changeValue(e.keyCode); controlState.resetControlChangeListener(); } controlState.controlChangeListener = listener; btn.action = function(){ window.addEventListener("keydown", listener); } buttons.push(btn.generateSettingPreRenders()); off++; })(); } 
Is there any tool available for cross browser testing?

Just some dumbass trying to rank this in Google. Can mods delete it?
define broken?
Arguably not. Properly named variables and structuring helps maintain code readability. Chaining a bunch of map filter reduce map map quack map promise filter filter together to be "more functional", because it's hip, is just asking for trouble. Plus, the way suggested means functional overhead every single damn iteration. Functions are pricy. 
The sad thing about this pattern is that it essentially rediscovered using classes (in JS case objects). There are several concerns in design, and whatnot, as some posters mentioned. You have to be very careful arranging your data, making some mandatory, some not, then hiding it all behind simple object mechanics. The other downside I see of RORO is the half-assed method chaining smell. But I digress. 
The argument in the blog has never been convincing to me, instead of referring to specifically named objects within files why not just flip it around and have loosely named objects inside specifically named files. (e.g. Instead of having a `.format` function inside a generic "utils.js" file, just make a `format.js` file). Ultimately the way VS Code works does that means it has to parse *every* file ahead of time anyway so there's no reason it can't suggest names for default exports too (just use the filename (in camelcase if it isn't already)). e.g. If you start typing `import foo` then it can just suggest all default exports of files that start with `foo` (`./fooBar.js`, `./qux/fooBaz.js`, etc) however deep they are, this is no more expensive than what it does already (in fact it's cheaper as it doesn't need to bother parsing the files at all). 
Now why would you recommend using Array.prototype.some() instead of a .length &gt; 0? Length is a property/field, not a function. Calling some, and adding in a filter function or whatever is more pricy than simply calling .length &gt; 0. Even then, if you're so keen on removing &gt; 0 from the code, you can just do .length. 
Rxjs and redux are independent of one another. There are libraries for managing redux store selectors through rxjs streams but that doesn't have a whole lot of bearing on what you are trying to do here. Fundamentally redux is dealing with state once the client has it. It's a useful abstraction but not completely relevant to managing many http requests as you are trying to make. Rxjs is simply an asynchronous stream library. You can tie it to http calls or events or selectors from a redux store or basically anything that is asynchronous (technically you can tie it to synchronous processes to but let's ignore that for a moment). Redux does have various addons to manage asynchronous tasks like thunk. And those are useful, I'm not telling you not to use one of those. But again that's orthogonal to your issue at hand. Your issue is that you can't spam the api. Rxjs provides many ways to handle this, and can get quite complicated. So it's hard to give a full solution in a Reddit post. But what you want to do is look in to both the buffer and window operators for rxjs. That way you can create X number of http requests but only actually initiate Y where Y is however many the api will accept without cancelling them. Basically you can use rxjs to group together a certain number of requests, initiate them, wait for the responses, and then start another batch of the total requests once those are complete. Rxjs is a very powerful library. But it can also be very complex especially if you have no prior knowledge of dealing with asynchronous streams. It can definitely do what you want. But it will take some effort on your part to learn. That's a broad over view. If you want to ask any more detailed questions I can try and help.
Thanks a lot for the response and the insight, much appreciated! I will have further looks into RxJS, see, if I can get my head around streams (something I've never touched so far). I might stop for a second with the further development and dive into existing approaches similar to mine.
&gt;I don't need to: Almost always irrelevant because &gt;function overhead is negligible unless you're doing it a huge number of times. As I already said, yes, for loops are faster, but often *completely negligibly* faster. The built-in descriptors, abstraction, iteration, and composability all favor the Array iteration methods over `for`.
