very nice, but a bit slow
excellent :)
Nice work. I like. Can I make a small point about the explosions though. They have a 'square' look to them, presumably because you are constructing a 2D vector for each particle from two random values between a given range. But if you build the vector from a random angle and speed, you will get a 'round' explosion that looks more like a firework...
Here's the change I'm suggesting in code form: function explodeParticle(x, y) { var i = 0; while (i &lt; 42) { var angle = Math.random() * Math.PI*2; var speed = Math.random() * 10.; var p = { x : x, y : y, xs: Math.sin(angle) * speed, ys: Math.cos(angle) * speed, s : 4, l : 60 } particles.push(p); ++i; } REMANCE = 10; }

&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; Try saying that to Hippocrates. This was for a job interview, asking to "*Explain JavaScript Closures to your grandmother or an eight-year-old child in 100 words or less*". A child doesn't know what a function is; alternatively they wouldn't know what a scalpel or local anesthesia are (if you had kept reading, you'd have seen the italicized satire).
put this in your node prompt: (function(){console.log(arguments.callee.caller.toString())}()) You may have to read it for me though, I am retarded.
It sounds like a Chrome issue rather then one with his editor.
Cool start! Snap-to-grid would be nice.
I saw it, I was not impressed.
This might be useful: image-rendering: -o-crisp-edges, perhaps. See http://jsfiddle.net/zda24/ and http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/2011/11/07/what-s-new-in-opera-development-snapshots-4-november-2011-edition (image resampling section). Feel free to email me -&gt; miket@opera.com about some of those issues. ;)
Ah nice! How did I miss that? If I can get that working (I've found some nearest neighbor implementations don't work well in some scenarios) I'll get LTP working well in Opera ASAP. The alternative is to do zooming with canvas transforms which is significantly more work, I'm trying to avoid that.
I have that for the size field. Just added if to name too, will go out next time I push. Thanks.
For sure, it's coming soon, along with the ability to define what grid sizes you want.
How do you change the color?
as somebody who has learnt 90% of what he know about javascript and web apps through view source, no, please no if anything give developers a readable and whitespaced version of your source and link to it in a comment of your source.
I mentioned querySelector + getElementsByClassName as alternatives to jQuery or other such libraries. Adding getElementById would have been a good addition, yes. Thank you.
I found that a couple of days ago, but I haven't gotten to putting some benchmarks together. It is definitely a notable library!
CTRL+Z is supposed to undo, not adjust the zoom .. try CTRL + or CTRL - for that.
Looks great but I really want an AMD module system, or at least the common JS system used in node. The one that they're proposing sucks.
Interesting. Started to see some real value towards the end of the screencast. I'l give it a try when I do some refactoring this weekend.

This looks like an enormous amount of boilerplate for a simple web page.
Too late, already read it :D. (Who knew RSS readers were faster than reddit).
Wow. Really creative and interest. Looking at the source code already.
This sentiment is seen a lot when people first approach Backbone. The truth is, if you are making a site like the demos out there, you don't need Backbone. The reason the demo is a simple web page is to keep things easy to understand. The power of Backbone comes into play in complex applications, i.e. applications that use the HTML5 History API, applications that work without an Internet connection, applications that need to render templates in many different places at many different times without a browser refresh.
The code seems to rely on jQuery. Why isn't it injected as a dependent named module ?
Pretty much exactly what @cmwelsh said. Showing a full blown application is not such a good idea when trying to convey the basic concept. Its like trying to explain hello world in Java. Lots of overhead, but you have to start somewhere.
I've fixed it. Sorry about that.
You're welcome. BTW, is it normal that "keyBinding" variable used at [line 251](https://github.com/RobertWHurst/KeyboardJS/blob/master/keyboard.js#L251) is declared within the for loop at [line 272](https://github.com/RobertWHurst/KeyboardJS/blob/master/keyboard.js#L272)?
Yea. On line 272 the key binding object is being created and stored. Its in a for loop because you may want a number of bindings to fire the same callback. Each time the object is different. I did this for readability. I'd use let instead of var if it were available but its not, and frankly in this case it doesn't matter.
Yes, by all means, let's force `&lt;pre&gt;`s into a column that's only 536 pixels wide and then apply `overflow-x: scroll` so that there's a frustrating horizontal scroll bar on anything wider than about 75 chars. That makes for *such* a pleasant viewing experience and in no way makes me want to rush for the "remove all page styles" button so that I can have my damn page width back.
I'm just wrapping up a fairly large Backbone app (~50 views and 14 routes) and this would have come in handy for sure. Right now we've got all our templates included as static script blocks but the main page is starting to become unruly :) We ended up building our own "Page" abstraction that separate Page instances can extend but your library covers some nice things like encapsulating subViews in a declarative way. I'm going to give it a shot on my next app, thanks for posting!
Could have used some editing. The slides aren't shown. To make matters worse, the slides aren't available anywhere. That makes the talk a lot less useful.
It seems more modular plus it works on Node without any hacks.

This wasn't asked the last time either, but doesn't it bother anyone else that the timing seems to fluctuate really badly? Other canvas/audio stuff works fine for me, so I don't think it's my specs. Or is it?
1. You're right. 2. (lambda x, y: x + y)(1, 1) will return 2 3. PIP 4. http://docs.python.org/library/sched.html
3b) you can do this with python as well. 3c) you can define with \_\_all\_\_ = ['names of variables to export when using import * from module'] 
You have an XSS vulnerability right there. For example, I could simply change your 'n' parameter to say something like this: n=50;alert();// That would pop up an alert to your user and throw no errors. Though, since your server is escaping the parameter, no one can redirect your users. Still, better be safe and validate your parameters server-side (write them to the page only if they're a number or something like that) Also, as far as I can remember, setInterval has a minimum limit (15, I think), and you're setting it to 10. That's 1/100th of a second is what you're aiming for. Also, 0, would also mean 15 (if I'm correct about that limit on setInterval), not 1000 frames per second. You'd be better of passing a function to the setInterval instead of a string, since that tends to 'eval' it. Do something like this: setInterval(function (){ animate(); }, 1000/30); That plays at 30 frames per second, by the way. I know nothing about Newtonian physics, so I can't give you feedback about that. But looks like you've done a good job. Edit: The spec says the minimum timeout is 4ms, so what I was saying about it being 15ms is wrong. &gt; If the currently running task is a task that was created by the setTimeout() method, and timeout is less than 4, then increase timeout to 4. http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/timers.html#timers
yeah but notice you can grab the spinning dots and stop/screw the sequence entirely
Nice idea, but a it's bad coding style to make everything global. Try to use jslint or jshint.
Canvas animations should make use of [requestAnimationFrame](http://paulirish.com/2011/requestanimationframe-for-smart-animating/)
Amusing. I'm a Mootools advocate myself, and it's mildly depressing to see jQuery usage skyrocket (relatively, anyway), while the rest maintain the status quo. But in the end, we're all client-side devs anyway, and whichever library you specialise in is just a matter of choice. The library choice just speaks to the type of work involved... jQuery is heavier on DOM manipulation, and I do agree you can do some cool things with it that take longer to do otherwise.
renaissance? when the hell did it disappear from every webdevs toolkit??
Cool project, but http://bl.ocks.org/ may be what you're looking for.
Yea, I wasn't experienced in OOP and common coding styles back then. I'm rarely making global variables nowadays.
Didn't know about that, thanks!
Why is that depressing? It doesn't stop you from using mootools and like you said, which library you use depends on what you're creating. There is nothing wrong with jQuery. Ok this may sound crazy, but get this: I'll use either, depending on the circumstances :o
Given how short it is, I don't think it really matters.
Thanks! I fixed the vulnerabilities. I knew they were there, I just didn't think they were important. As for the limit you might be right. I'm going to test that later, I can't find any documentation on active tab interval limiting. Tabs in the background do have limits. I'm using requestAnimationFrame now anyway. I don't know if it made things any faster.
Good god man, are you talking about using the *right tool for the job*?? That is sacrilege!!!
I agree. I'm fine with anything, as long as people use it as a *library*, and as long as people know what their code is actually doing. I really dislike reading setTimeout/setInterval callbacks getting executed hundres of times per second, that has dozens of `$('#foo')` calls, all fetching the same element. Store it in a variable, damn it! And if it's possible to fetch it outside of the callback, then do so!
Very interesting article. I'm actually interviewing today for a job that uses Dojo, which according to that article is used in only 0.2% of websites (up from 0.1% a year ago).
Ok, in that case it's kinda okay, I guess (as in not an error). But from a musical point of view I think it's bad.
It's actually refreshing. I remember 10 years ago when you had to avoid using JS as some clients had it turned off or unstable depending upon the browser.
I'm guessing that less usage = less community. so if more people are using jQuery you could assume that if those people weren't using jquery they might be using mootools which would mean more community and more support for mootools. Sorry if I'm being pedantic.
We've really swung full circle. JS has become so ubiquitous that there's now a NoScript backlash, as people have figured out that pages load so much quicker and with so fewer annoyances/dangers if they disable JS. I'd argue that it's just as important today as it was in the Netscape era to test your site with scripting disabled to make sure that at least the basic functionality still works. Obviously for "app" sites like gmail that's not a possibility, but if you're the website of a local television station I had damn well better be able to at least read the body copy of a news item without loading/parsing/executing your hundreds of kbytes of heavy scripting framework for video playback and Facebook integration and all that junk. 
In this case I'd blame the messenger not the message, sites where you expect to use inline code examples should not have tiny fixed width columns. I use it on internal site that has a responsive layout and it works swimmingly.
Oh, for sure! I didn't mean to sound jealous or anti-jQuery at all, as I recognize its advantages and disadvantages wrt other frameworks. I was merely saying that I was feeling mildly depressed due to some juvenile reaction to not being on the winning team, that's all ;)
I'll confess I sometimes get these feelings too, it's inevitable :p
I think browsers should start supporting Javascript libraries locally. Would make things a lot faster and save bandwidth by not downloading it for each different site.
I hate seeing the same thing! My coworker is just learning JavaScript/jQuery and doesn't understand why I always use so many variables.
It's not becoming less, just not growing. However, you bring up a good point that I hadn't considered.
Sites at my work rely heavily on JS and no one seems to have a problem with it. We have a &lt;noscript&gt; tag at the top to let users know our site runs (better) with JS on, but we do almost no progressive enhancement. It's just, code with JS first and foremost. We use jump menus without a round trip fallback, a completely AJAX implementation of Solr for searching, with no round trip fallback, our menus are actually drawn with javascript on page load. I could go on, but it's kinda mind numbing.
Love the honesty here, a feeling all developers have at some point..
I don't want my browser polluted with this garbage. JS frameworks exist because they make some DOM insecure JS developers happy, and not because they make the end user happy. Furthermore code is updated regularly and if this stuff were local to my browser it just serves as yet another potential point of vulnerability and exploitation.
Isn't this a little inefficient binding all elements on the page to a dom event? $('*').focus(function(e) { focusedElement = $(e.target); }); $('*').blur(function(e) { focusedElement = false; });
Not at all, Its required. Someone could pass .bind.key any element as a focus scope. I need to know what element is in focus to check against it. Read the .bind.key method and your see why.
This wont help any site that is built correctly, aka sites that mash their JS. Not to mention I've seen people make their own version of jquery with patches, and sites that use really old versions. I doubt 30-50kb is really slowing you down that much. If it is you might need to invest in faster internet.... or move.
Found that via github where the guy also hosts the code: https://github.com/jnaO/JavaScript-Game-Challenge
I think what you are looking for could be, document.activeElement; 
That would have a lot of drawbacks/problems and pretty much all the benefits could be achieved through other means like caching/CDNs etc.
Where do you work?
the programmer should be in charge of setting up the focus binding, theres no need for you to predict. Why not have the user pass in the jquery selector or $el for the input that needs the key bindings?
Slides are here: http://www.slideshare.net/ben_teese/the-return-of-javascript-3-opensource-projects-that-are-driving-javascripts-renaissance
A lot of sites are already using from Google CDN (http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/). What I am thinking is something similar to this available locally. They'd have to specify library version just like for this Google CDN. 30-50kb may not be big, but when you multiply that with millions of visits, it does make a lot of redundant data transfer.
A 100% increase in one year is no laughing matter.
Yea that's a good idea. But I think i'm going to remove this feature.
Also a good, point. It was requested by another developer, but I was ify about adding it in the first place.
Frameworks never make end-user happy, except that they can get what they want developed faster. Frameworks are always for the developers. Frameworks like jQuery have helped developers like myself save hundreds of hours - which would have been wasted in making Javascript compatible across all different browsers. Also, the code so compact and easier to maintain. I'm having a feeling that you haven't worked on writing Javascript for older browsers( in the IE 5/6 days).
Our site has 3 libraries on every page.
The spec says to `Math.max(interval, 4)` the interval passed.
These instructions are no less specific to the given platform/framework in use than the google results that the article begins by chastising. This isn't "how to add RSS to a blog" it's "how to use the data2xml library to generate a RSS feed with some software that I wrote using node.js."
Exactly what I needed today, but the solution is disappointing. I already knew that workaround. I was hoping it would be some small patch which actually fixes the issue.
Something wrong with $("body").delegate() / on() ? One binding deals with all children, including dynamically added ones.
Yes, wouldn't it be nice if every browser implimented their own, broken, old version of libraries!? Lets just get them to support things like QSA.
 var my = { compileTemplate: function (str, data) { var c = { evaluate : /&lt;%([\s\S]+?)%&gt;/g, interpolate : /&lt;%=([\s\S]+?)%&gt;/g }, tmpl = 'var __p=[],print=function(){__p.push.apply(__p,arguments);};' + 'obj=obj||{};__p.push(\'' + str.replace(/'/g, "\\'") .replace(c.interpolate, function (match, code) { return "',obj." + code.replace(/\\'/g, "'") + ",'"; }) .replace(c.evaluate || null, function (match, code) { return "');" + code.replace(/\\'/g, "'") .replace(/[\r\n\t]/g, ' ') + "__p.push('"; }) .replace(/\r/g, '\\r') .replace(/\n/g, '\\n') .replace(/\t/g, '\\t') + "');return __p.join('');", func = new Function('obj', tmpl); return data ? func(data) : func; } }; var t = my.compileTemplate('foo is: &lt;%=foo%&gt;, bar is &lt;% if(obj.bar&gt;5){ %&gt;greater than 5&lt;% } else { %&gt;smaller than 5 (or doesn\'t exist)&lt;% } %&gt;'); console.log(t()); console.log(t({foo: 'FOO!'})); console.log(t({foo: 'FOO!', bar: 7})); **output:** foo is: , bar is smaller than 5 (or doesn't exist) foo is: FOO!, bar is smaller than 5 (or doesn't exist) foo is: FOO!, bar is greater than 5 **caveat:** `obj.bar` instead of `bar` inside evaluate tags. Icky, but slightly better.
I am only able to get 2 keys on a single row to show up at a time. so h, j, i works but h, j, k does not. (only h and j show up)
oh btw, FF5.0 Ubuntu 11.04
Yea, I found that there are some strange edge cases with the DOM and key binding. Sometimes, depending on the keys pressed, the browser doesn't fire an event. In most cases with isn't an issue, but if you want it to work in all cases you'll have to talk to mozilla.
Thats also true. This feature was an after thought and is going to be removed anyway.
It could be something like this http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/, but available locally. Many people are already using this, so why can't we have the same locally? I know it does add problems, but I believe benefits are huge when you consider the amount of data transferred for Javascript libraries for millions of visits across different sites. 
Good point. I should make the article more generic. The main problem I had was figuring out how to set up the links. Writing the XML with any old xml library would do. Yes the code is specific to node.js but it's just example code. I'd be equally specific if it was php / ruby or python. The google results I chastisted were high level results about using web services to create rss feeds. I couldn't find anything about creating the xml with some code or injecting the correct links into your blog.
Not to state the obvious, but have you read up on TDD as a concept independent of a language? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_driven_development
I don't really understand why people do this. I'm sure the excuse is usually time and budget, but in my experience it's actually easier to build progressively since you can break complex features down to smaller components and then put them together. You end up spending a lot less time hunting down obscure bugs or fighting against multiple elements conflicting with each other. At least you provide a warning that the site will break horribly without JS, though.
The biggest impact on page load speed is by far HTTP requests, not overall file size. Minify and aggregate the CSS/JS files, enable zip compression, and sprite as many images as possible and load times will be drastically reduced, but adding or removing 20-30kb won't make much difference either way.
I like this library in theory. The API is nice and clean. I also like how it lends itself to easily allowing users to set up their own key bindings for one's app. But I'm not too thrilled with the jQuery dependency. It seems like your jQuery needs are quite minimal though and it could be pulled out pretty easily. It'd also be nice to provide the option to preventDefault() so things like cmnd+s/ctrl+s won't invoke built in browser functionality.
Right, because not only do we have to deal with HTML and CSS browser-incompatibility issues, let's introduce javascript into the mix... These libraries themselves are designed to work around browser incompatibilities... if browsers rolled their own default versions in, we'd just be nullifying their work.
All very true. Watch for the next version. I'll remove jQuery.
How do you start a game?
It's usually used to make things smoother by actually letting the browser know that you're animating, and it's just not a usual interval. It works similarly to setInterval, and setInterval is also used as a fallback when requestAnimationFrame isn't available. [requestAnimationFrame - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.requestAnimationFrame)
A better idea is to just migrate to using [Handlebars.JS](http://www.handlebarsjs.com/) which doesn't throw errors if the key you define in a template isn't found in the data you're attempting to merge in. I started with _.template, and it's nice but it only gets you so far and the way it handles this error (and others) really slows down app development. Handlebars++

right, took me some time too to figure out. in the top line type a number in the second field and click the third button that looks like a stick figure.
Read [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742) by Crockford. He goes over structuring JavaScript in an OOP fashion. More generally it's a great book that will bring your understanding of JS from intermediate to the beginnings of expert.
Yeah JS:TGP is really required reading for professional Javascripters. I've also heard great reviews of [Javascript patterns](http://www.amazon.co.uk/JavaScript-Patterns-Stoyan-Stefanov/dp/0596806752/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322639410&amp;sr=8-1) by Stoyan Stefanov. The sample chapter is good, I'm hoping to buy it later. [Felix's Node Style Guide](http://nodeguide.com/style.html) is good too (basic style guide) and has some good rules to apply to your normal JS as well as NodeJS. After that, browse through http://javascript.crockford.com/ Learn the [module pattern](http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2007/06/12/module-pattern/) and it's prettier sister the [revealing module pattern](http://christianheilmann.com/2007/08/22/again-with-the-module-pattern-reveal-something-to-the-world/) and understand how it works. I use RVM everywhere by default, pretty much. Once you've done all the above you should be able to say confidently: * I understand event driven programming * I understand scope * I understand closure * I understand prototypes More generally; * I understand the importance of separation of concerns * I can choose the appropriate level of abstraction for my objects * My code is written with re-use in mind General tips: Install firebug, JSONView. Get a good editor; I've had good experiences with textpad (win), Komodo(mac) and sublimetext(x-platform). Worry more about readability and maintainability than performance in general. A nice phrase I came up with the other day: Simple code doing clever things is great, clever code doing simple things is bad. Read other people's code. Read the unminified jQuery source, and other libraries. Try writing pure JS before going down the heavy-reliance-on-jQuery route.

Great resources...Thanks.
I don't know all that much about hardware, but I've known that some keyboards can't process too many keys at once too well or certain combinations just don't work. I don't think it has anything to do with the library itself. 
http://learn.appendto.com/ has vanilla js and jquery, some good exercises, connects the two 
&gt; I think I need to have a [0] somewhere or not say 'each' Yep. "this" refers to the current item in the list inside the each iterator. So that's what you need to replace. Instead of: $.each(events, function() { container.append($.nano(template, this)); }); Use: container.append($.nano(template, events[0]));
You should be able to just remove the `$.each` and do: container.append($.nano(template, events[0]));
To both of you! QUICKEST REDDIT RESPONSE EVER! This is perfect, thank you. Upboats for all!

Nice article, something I know confuses a lot of canvas developers initially. Another error that confuses people initially is the negative placement giving you a dom error with canvas.
[A previous comment on this topic with lots of links](http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/jovnc/i_need_a_plan_of_action_for_learning_javascript/c2dxa5s). (We should put some links in the sidebar about this, or sticky a post, or something. It's a very common question.)
So then javascript can never be used to upload a foreign image to the server? Say I wanted to make an image uploading website be as user friendly as possible. Someone finds a funny image on imagesite.com, and want to upload it to his account on mysite.com. I could add a drop-event on mysite.com, and tell the user to drag the image there from any website. But that won't work because you're not dragging the image, only it's url, and you can't use that to get the content of the image with javascript because of this security issue. Workarounds include having the server download the image, using flash/java, or telling the user to save it to his computer then upload it from there. All bad choices. Is there really no way to have javascript do it? I think it would be really useful.
Doesn't sound like there's a set of 'rules' at all then. Just one -- you can't do cross-domain ever. And really? Why the fuck not? Flash gets around this just fine by setting a flag and a cross-domain whitelist.
Javascript != Canvas. This is only specifically regarding the canvas getImageData() and toDataUrl() methods. [And workarounds exist.](http://www.maxnov.com/getimagedata/) Although if you ask me, they shouldn't have been needed in the first place. 
Similarly, Canvas can do the exact same thing: http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/
Thanks, this should have been covered in the article.
In case you don't want or need Reddit gold, I could get you some game on Steam instead, or something. We'll figure something out.
That's what I found out when making this library.
Amazing list. Thank you!
&gt; Pass by reference / value Just a nit-pick: In Ecmascript, saying "objects are passed by reference" is misleading if not outright wrong. Rather, arguments in Ecmascript are passed by value (or perhaps "passed by sharing" in the case of objects). People get confused because Objects, Functions, etc are *reference types* ...so the *value of the variable holding them is a reference*. When you do this: var foo = { fizz: "buzz" }; "foo" is a "slot" in the stack, and what it holds (it's value) is a reference to an object in the heap. If you do: function bam ( arg1 ) { // do something } When you call "bam", the Ecmascript standard explicitly says the implementation should copy the *value* of each argument provided to [[call]] and bind it to the respective argument in the function declaration/arguments object. So when you do: bam( foo ); The implementation takes the slot in the stack that is "foo" and takes it's value (a reference to an object in the heap) and *copies* it into a local binding (arg1 and/or the appropriate spot in the arguments object) for the execution of "bam". There is an actual copying operation, the value of "foo" is duplicated. You are passing the value, it just so happens that the value is *a reference*...however passing any old reference is not the same as "passing by reference". That implies you are passing a particular reference; one to *foo itself* (which is a "slot" to hold something)...instead you are passing *what is in the "slot"*, it's value. There's a couple reasons I think it's important to make this distinction: - The reason for the observed behavior is that Objects, Functions, etc are reference types. Having this knowledge better informs the coder as to why this is happening, and it also informs them as to how they will behave in other situations besides argument-passing...saying "when calling a function, objects are passed by reference" obscures what is happening and does not inform the coder how objects will behave in other situations such as assignment. - Calling it "pass by reference" can be confusing. "Pass by reference" generally implies that you can do this: function swap( a, b) { var c = a; a = b; b = c; } var foo = { val: 1}, bar = { val: 2 }; swap( foo, bar ); // Coder who was told "objects are passed by reference" and who has experience with other languages with "pass by reference" semantics expects "foo" and "bar" to swap, but finds they don't. Note that the author of the article you link to was themselves confused by the terminology. 
&gt; Obviously for "app" sites like gmail that's not a possibility Pretty sure GMail supports non-JS clients still. While 100% of the features may not be present, it's still _supported_.
Browsers do support a similar concept in the form of a [HTTP access control header](https://developer.mozilla.org/En/HTTP_access_control#Access-Control-Allow-Origin). FYI, this blog post was originally a [stackoverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8317015). I suggested a couple of ways of getting around CORS restrictions in my answer to the same question: http://stackoverflow.com/a/8317691/53926 I also included Recoil42 `img-to-json` workaround. It's very clever =].
&gt; Frameworks never make end-user happy, except that they can get what they want developed faster. End users give dick about your development schedule. This is a figment of a developer's self gratifying imagination. Frameworks are there to make a developer's life easier, but if you need a framework to get your releases out the door faster then there is a very fundamental problem somewhere in your internal development supply line that is wasting your time and costing you money.
Is it just me or is there a lot of artefacts present in the output? (Actually sometimes all I get is colourful static...) [Chromium 15, Linux x86_64] Does that mean they aren't actually implementing a complete VP8 decoder? Any idea how much slower this is than a standard x86 software decoder?
Unfortunately, it works best on browsers that already support VP8. The rest of them tend to have slower JS engines, no WebGL support, no binary arrays, and sometimes even no canvas. Still, great demo to blow up a few more javascript stereotypes. 
Different browsers seem to treat datauris differently with this. Chrome lets me take a video (datauri via File API) and spit frames to canvas then call toDataUrl() on the individual frames. Firefox throws a security error which is bullshit and prevents an app of mine from working. Does anyone know which one is correct?
It's a complete decoder, but it appears to have some glitches. Those might be bugs in the translation process, or limitations of the platform (VP8 uses 64-bit integers, which are problematic in JS, for example). This is just a very early version, if more work is put into it the glitches can probably be fixed. 
&gt;packaging it up into jQuery extensions and clean as hell While it's better than one large ball of spaghetti, I wouldn't call this "clean as hell". I'm using the pattern from this talk: [Nicholas Zakas — Scalable JavaScript Application Architecture](http://stage.yuilibrary.com/theater/nicholas-zakas/zakas-architecture/) While it's not *the* way to do gigantic monolithic applications (gmail, maps, large games, etc), it does work perfectly well for most types of websites. E.g. something like Twitter, Reddit, ecommerce sites, and things like that. Basically, there is some central registry for all of your modules. Once the page is loaded all registered modules are started. None of the modules knows anything about any other module. Or more precisely: they *cannot* know anything about any other module. If you want some kind of communication you can fire events and every module which listens to them may react in some way. What's great about this is that it fixes the complexity at a fairly straightforward level. If you write a new module, it doesn't matter if there are other modules and it also doesn't matter what they do. You just take care of this single one-trick-pony and that's all you have to do. I really like it. The only downside is that there is some boilerplate code required, but if you use a text editor which supports abbreviations, that annoyance can be taken care of.
why don't we just put the answer to this question in the sidebar of the subreddit. It is asked multiple times a day and tends to take up about 30% of the space on the what's hot tab. The answer is always the same!
Poor guy.
Upvoted. This has always been a mystery in JS, hahahaaa 
LOL. Sadly, this is not exaggerated enough to look like a parody of anything.
Douglas Crockford did a series of 3 lectures: 1. The Javascript Programming Language http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2007/01/24/video-crockford-tjpl/ 2. An Inconvenient API: The Theory of the DOM http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/10/20/video-crockford-domtheory/ 3. Advanced Javascript http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/11/27/video-crockford-advjs/ These videos were the first tutorials I found aimed at teaching javascript as a programming language, rather than a thing web designers can copy and paste code from. 
I thought it was going to be a discussion about: &gt; 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3 == true false 
&gt;`true / false` &gt;Infinity Whoa. I swear, you could write some shitty code if you were dedicated to mindfucking any future readers.
(0.1+0.2)+0.3 !== 0.1+(0.2+0.3) Javascript is awesome, but fails at floating point arithmetic.
This isn't really JavaScript's fault. You have to expect stuff like that and code for it accordingly. Lots of languages handle floating point like this. The bug is in your program, not the language.
&gt; Lots of languages handle floating point like this. Most languages. All who follow the [IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic (IEEE 754)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-2008), for those who are curious.
/r/programming post: [Add a number to another number in JavaScript \[img\]](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/buosj/add_a_number_to_another_number_in_javascript_img/) - 1016 points - submitted 1 year ago by dreasgrech - 345 comments So, plenty of discussion to read if you're interested in this.
Bit of an elitist reaction. Make fun of and trick the new guy. Downvote someone trying to be nice. Kinda funny, but it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Edit: Sure, the guy should have googled first and asked questions later, but still.
Yeah, sometimes Reddit is a rough place.
Yeah OC, clearly does not understand how floating point numbers work. NEVER compare directly. Always compare ranges. If you must compare directly, compare a range very close to the number, or avoid using floating point numbers.
The third reply is funny, everyone knows the + operator is for string concatenation.
You know it's not a picture of an actual situation, right?
It is certainly Javascript's fault that there is no choice BUT to use floating point arithmetic. All numbers in JS are floats.
Try not linking to a secure site, for starters: "Your session has expired. Please log in again." Edit: Without the actual assignment those hints are baffling to me. Then again, I'm a bit drunk, too.
It works fine for integers up to +/- 2^53 (~9 quadrillion - that's a 9 with 15 zeros).
Obviously anyone who wants to add numbers with one decimal should go learn floating point theory first. [/sarcasm] Regardless of whether it's implemented correctly, this behavior is bad. JS needs better numbers, or at least an alternative. Edit: Added the [/sarcasm] tag that people didn't intuit.
I've seriously tried a dozen permutations of this. With quotes. Without quotes. Creating a function and calling it. Creating an anonymous function and calling it. Throwing alert() in the &lt;body&gt; tag. I think there must be a disconnect in my brain when it comes to javascript. I can write large programs in bourne, php, and I'm conversational in perl. I grok ruby, and I've written in quickbasic and turbo pascal. WTF is it about javascript that I just don't get? 
integers?
Forgot the user card on the question.
&lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;script&gt; window.onLoad=alert('hi'); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; Testing! &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;
javascript is case sensitive, you had onload instead of onLoad 
also its script type="text/javascript" &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; window.onload = function() { alert('hi'); }; &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; Testing! &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;
The `onload` attribute does not take a string value, it takes a function. Either give it the name of an existing function, or use an anonymous function: function foo() { alert('hi'); } window.onload = foo; or window.onload = function() { alert('hi'); }; 
Could have been a legitimate question, eg using parseInt() because integer type does not exist in JS. 
You can concatenate strings without jQuery?
By the time you replied, I had this script exactly, except instead of &lt;script&gt;, I had &lt;scrip language="text/javascript"&gt; and that stopped it. Because the right term is 'type="text/javascript"' (or to just leave it off, apparently) sigh. Thanks very much. I really appreciate it. 
Also, why don't I get any javascript errors in my console at all? 
take a glance at this, you can really make javascript completely unreadable: http://holyvier.blogspot.com/2011/10/javascript-obfuscation-introduction.html
The problem goes all the way down to the hardware architecture (binary vs. decimal). Most JS engines are open source though so feel free to submit a patch.
Because you weren't running javascript.. You were telling the browser that the script tag contained a language of "text/javascript" which doesn't exist so the browser doesn't know what to do with it and skips over it. "javascript" would have worked.. You can actually use this language attribute other times, like with jquery templates
Javascript is just a fun language all around. Math.min() &lt; Math.max(); // false I mean, who woulda thunk it? But I think my favorite is: typeof NaN // number I love this language.
I checked JSPerf on continue statements, there were 3 tests involving the use of continue and the results are inconclusive with regards to performance with or without, or rather the tests are conclusive that continue is good in some areas, bad in others, and otherwise didn't make a difference which hints at optimization from the engines. It depends on the engine, the coding style and logic behind the continue statement.
&gt; Obviously anyone who wants to add numbers with one decimal should go learn floating point theory first. Absolutely not. If this is an issue for a great number of programmers, then the problem lies with the documentation / text-books / instructors / profs. Knowing how floating point numbers work is something of a *shiboleth* in programming circles. If they cared more about *leading practitioners to the right answer*, then non-IEEE options would be introduced more often. (Though I must now put on my monocle and note that Common Lisp and Scheme have pretty visible alternatives to avoid this.)
I love the last comment... &gt;"you suck" - Timothy Goatse
It's weird - I knew Dimitri for a year or so on IRC from the #jquery channel - then I found out how young he was - blew me away that someone so young could teach us old fogies. He's also quite active in the Drupal community, working on big modules like Views
He shouldn't be mixing processing code with output code. What he really needs is a MVC approach, some sort of framework library to separate the arithmatic part of his program from the output routines. Promotes re-use and simpler testing.
I remember this post. stratoscope's plugin finally made it possible for me to add numbers in JavaScript. Native support for addition is a real shortcoming for the language.
No surprise there. There are tons of people who can't do JavaScript and are wholly reliant on jQuery which is why the idea of using jQuery plugins is scary. jQuery is becoming the new PHP.
For integers yes, for anything with a decimal point, no.
When you realize that bobince wrote this to make himself feel better about his brilliant and intelligent and smart and helpful and clearly awesome answers getting ignored, it becomes a lot less funny and a lot more irritating.
If you really need scientific precision you could multiply by 10^n where n=significant digits to get an integer before you do your operations. But really you just seem to want to blame Javascript for what is really a problem of math itself: different radices have different amounts of precision in their fractional part.
Please tell me his job title isn't a "Web Developer"
that doesn't do what you would expect it to actually - even with the proper capitalisation. What it does is assign the return value of alert('hi); to the onload handler. What you're saying is "I want the onload handler to be whatever "alert('hi');" returns" which means alert('hi'); needs to get executed. So the alert fires *before* the page is loaded, and sets 'undefined' as the window.onload handler. For example consider this: function getHandler(str) { // I run immediately whether onload has been fired or not return function() { // I run only when onload is fired alert(str); }; } window.onload = getHandler('hi'); now window.onload is a reference to the created anonymous function which alerts 'hi'.
jester1983's code does not do what you think it does, see my reply to his code.
&gt; Math.min() &lt; Math.max(); // false Only in JavaScript?
[Relevant...?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Weary)
Yes, but you have to beg the interpreter.
&gt;When I first came here, this was all swamp. Everyone said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built in all the same, just to show them. It sank into the swamp. So I built a second one. That sank into the swamp. So I built a third. That burned down, fell over, then sank into the swamp. But the fourth one stayed up. And that's what you're going to get, Lad, the strongest castle in all of England.
This is a satire of Stackoverflow, just about everyone's response to questions is to use jQuery, often even if they are using a different framework and tagged the questions as such, and even though it might not be the right tool for the job.
It's a phenomenon we see on Stackevery day. So while it may have been written by one contributor to soothe his ego, it's not just him who is annoyed by the other users on Stack. [The accepted answer here is to use hacky gross looking workaround in jQuery rather than simply using a nice pure dom function](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8332178/how-to-reference-an-id-with-brackets-in-jquery)
No revelations or high-level discourse to speak of, just a discussion of CI/build/documentation/code coverage tools.
I did something similiar a while back, heres my jsfiddle vs you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel. http://jsfiddle.net/loktar/GnY3q/show/lite/
&gt; jQuery is becoming the new PHP. How is that even possible?
Yeah. It looks like your site serves the same purpose as this subreddit. 
The language itself won't ever become as ugly as PHP which is fortunate for jQuery but it makes JS significantly easier so it attracts newbs by the boat load so you just really can't trust the plug-ins and you're left with a lot of sites running bad JS which is of no use to anyone and you lose some benefits to using jQuery because you might as well write the plugins you need yourself or just use something less popular like Moo Tools.
This is heaven.
Just to add onto what user24 said, the code alerts "hi" and takes the return value from the alert call (which is undefined since it doesn't return anything I believe) and sets it onto window.onload. Then when onload gets fired, it tries to take whatever was assigned to it and calls it (which is undefined), but the value that got set on window.onload is not a function, so nothing happens. 
Hence the name Echo...
To use jQuery one has to write JavaScript code. I don't see how one could use jQuery without JavaScript. I get what you mean, but I without knowing how JavaScript works you can barely get jQuery and some plugins running.
The math is exactly the same with and without the decimal place...this is not a JS problem..this is a problem in computer science and math in general...
I added it to the [list of animation libraries](https://github.com/bebraw/jswiki/wiki/Animation-libraries). Feel free to tweak the entry as you like. It's nice to see libraries like this cropping up.
That's great and all if you can make your site fit into the "single page app" mold. Personally, I can't stand sites like that. They are user-interface hell. Take twitter for example. Suppose I've scrolled down the page somewhat reading tweets, and then I decide to click on a hashtag. I read some, then click 'back' and boom, I'm at the top of the page, not where I was before. I have to remember where I was and then scroll all the way down to there, which potentially could be several screenfulls of autoloaded results. But it's all wiped away because of this stupid one-page app architecture. You can tell that they know there's a giant festering UI problem because they make all external links automatically open in a new tab, in a pathetic attempt to hide the fact that they're breaking the basic functionality of the browser's back button. 
&gt;The frontend itself is layered in tiers: Model, presentation and so on. We make heavy use of the observer-pattern, and use an object oriented component model. The application itself is a single-page application. All the html-templating is done entirely with JavaScript. Do they use Backbone.js?
Hi! Honestly, I haven't actually *approached* learning javascript so much as been forced into using it. For a long, long time, I haven't done any web development at all. I was a system administrator (hence the languages that I listed in my post) for 10 years. But I think the problem lies before that. A dozen years or so ago, I made webpages. I was not a "web developer", nor did I even know the term. I simply made webpages. In the capacity of someone who "made webpages", I needed to learn Javascript to do things that are simple now with CSS, like rotating graphics or things like that. The rules that are breaking my brain now were cemented in place back then. Things like, "put Javascript in the &lt;head&gt; tag so the whole page can see it" or "you must always define the language type in the &lt;script&gt; tag or the browser won't know what to do". Combine that with a large number of other languages that I've picked up, and what I end up with mentally is that "source=" looks so much like "src=" that it doesn't trigger a syntax error in my brain. I see a script tag with "source=dir/file.js" and my brain-parser says "oh yeah, that's cool, something else must be the problem", and of course HTML doesn't so much as murmor when it encounters an unknown argument to a tag, so I never get an error from the html parser, but the javascript file never gets included, and I can only deduce that it's not loading when I try to call something contained in it and the debugger raises a flag about something being null. TL;DR - I familiarized myself with javascript a long time ago, and I'm paying the price for not being up to date now. What resources would you suggest to refamiliarize myself with what are now considered best-practices? 
Twitter ought to be able to fix that problem if they wanted to. Don't write off single-page applications because of one bad implementation. But I agree that what you describe sucks. Google plus does the same. In fact I'm not sure that the problem is caused by the single-page app nature of twitter, but rather by the continous scrolling. The only part of Muscula that's a single page app, is the part that requires you to log in, and it fits nicely into the mold.
HTML5 media is far too much and completely unrelated to HTML. To say that HTML5 media is not enough is craziness like a terrorist jihadist ready to blow up day care centers full of those greedy capitalist toddlers. At first I just thought the article was more goo around HTML5 craziness, but when it jumped into corporate conspiracy theories I quickly confirmed the article went from ignorant to stupid. Flash media absolutely dominates HTML5 media not just because some people still use IE7 and IE8, but because it is a superior technology. It will continue to dominate as long as it continues to be a superior technology. Perhaps instead of trying to mindfucking people with conspiracy theory crap if they spent more time on the technology differences and the economics of the issue they would have more luck raising awareness and finding a solution to their problem.
JAVASCRIPT WZYRDS! LOSSLESS (FLAC or ALAC) AUDIO ON THE WEB PLZ!
Not necessary.
would love to see elaboration on "no orm" and "Once you've gone schemaless there is no going back to a traditional relational database". my understanding is that giving up relational database = giving up join = forced to denormalize your data = introduces an entire class of state bugs which are impossible when normalized. Orm sucks, but its better than denormalized data bugs. hell, ORM has been debated all over the place, even recently on HN, and i've never seen a convincing argument to give up orm when internet-scale isn't an immediate requirement.
 function min() { var min = Infinity; var i; for (i = 0; i &lt; arguments.length; i++) { if (arguments[i] &lt; min) { min = arguments[i]; } } return min; } function max() { var max = -Infinity; var i; for (i = 0; i &lt; arguments.length; i++) { if (arguments[i] &gt; max) { max = arguments[i]; } } return max; } console.log(min(5, 4, 1)); // 1 console.log(max(5, 4, 1)); // 5 console.log(min() &lt; max()); // false **EDIT:** Just to clarify, this is an example re-implementation of the Math.min() and Math.max() functions so you can see why it actually makes a lot of sense that "Math.min() &lt; Math.max()" equals "false".
It's not one bad implementation, "single page apps" tend to radically break how browsers expect the internet to work and be interlinked. Only the most recent browsers have begun to deal with this issue by letting us sneakily modify the history on the fly using JS. When I see single page apps consistently begin to get the same kind of flowing UI as "old school websites" I'll stop writing them off -- but that's aways to go, imo.
just like, you know, gmail?
Heh, I kinda like that notion. :)
Awesome, thanks! I just filled out the meta data a little bit more.
I'm not sure if this will work for all kinds of applications though. Storing all the state in the browser would work when your app is a small one or one that is heavily external-data-based (eg. weather, flight data, traffic app) or personal (to-do list, etc.) When you start creating an app which works by accumulating state from different users of the app (eg. reviews, social network) or just plainly data-heavy (eg. personal financing app), then you would have to start storing state in the server and this architecture becomes just like any other architectures with their own scalability problems. Edit: spelling.
So far the trade-of has worked tremendously in our favor. It has really been a huge factor in the fast iterations we've been able to do. The amount of work we've had to do has been so much less. That's important stuff for a startup. Perhaps we'll have to introduce a relational database for parts of our data as our application complexity grows, to avoid the problems you describe, but the schemaless core will always be an extremely important part of our application, and it would be even if we did not have to achive internet scale.
Blood, sweat, swearing and tears, mainly desperation and sadness, sometimes joy.
You'd probably like socket.io and/or dnode, which let you communicate with your back-end over websockets. Socket.io also has some redis pubsub stuff baked in, but I've only really used it for client/server communication. I don't know how much sproutcore and/or cappuccino give you, but if you're looking for a framework to drop on the front end, check out backbone. I'm more of a back-end guy, but I've heard good things about it. Express is a popular node.js web framework, and you'll find useful middlewares for it out there. Then, you'll just have to write a handler that does the API mapping! If express doesn't look like your deal, there are some other frameworks that are connect-compatible to varying degrees, such as Strata, Bricks and Union. My recommendation there would be to just search npm for stuff like "middleware", "socket.io", and "xml", choose some libraries, and go from there.
This is my favorite way of building apps now and have a few being release soon which follow this mode. One of the apps is a tool to help build this type of technology stack. I work on http://backbonetutorials.com and can understand why you would be so proud of a stack like this, the benefits are amazing. Well done and good luck!
ALAC.js coming very very soon! :) I know because I worked on it.
Thanks for the recommendations! Making use of socket.io (instead of AJAX) is a really good idea. Most of the things you've mentioned (Strata, Express, Bricks etc.) seem to be node.js related. We're definitely want to make use of these things if we go the node.js, but we still would need some sort of a front-end framework yes? We've looked a little at backbone.js and the fact that it can deal natively RESTful services is pretty nice. I wonder how well it fits with building user interactions / interfaces?
Thanks for the rundown, and excellent work!
I'd think you would need a front-end framework, yes---or, at least, dom tools and/or templates, a router, some sort of communication layer and some glue code. I think it depends on what you're building and how much structuring you expect from your libraries. Honestly, most of the stuff I've built on the front-end is jquery and some socket.io, and it sounds like you're looking for something heavier (I don't blame you). I don't know a ton about backbone myself, so I don't actually know if it has anything built-in when it comes to templating or building ui components; I think you mostly get a structure into which you can plug whatever sort of templating/rendering solution you like. I COULD BE WRONG.
github is a very good example of using history to make a 'single page app' work
In house custom build framework in Javascript, with little help of Selenium2 Grid to manage browser instances. Why? Full control, and JS code that goes well with application code (also in JS).
I'm just getting started with Node.js, MongoDB and Mongoose. I've been guided to this stack. If you don't mind, in your own words can you tell me what real world advantages this kind of stack brings? Especially to someone working with .net? I've been trying to convince my manager to consider this stack very seriously but i cant get him to see the benefits because i dont think i understand the technology well enough to convince him. We're currently using .net and SQL server at work. Typical Microsoft stack.
&gt;Serialization af data is even done in JSON witch is a part of JavaScript.
Don't you think you should understand it before you advocate it to your boss? Adopting new platforms has a lot of overhead.
Good point. Noted.
I JSHint to quash the low hanging fruit and use Jasmine for testing.

For my Pretty Diff tool testing is generally simple, because the bulk of the effort is algorithmic. As long as simple conventions of logic are used algorithmic code is generally safe cross-browser as you are primarily concerned with testing more complicated things. For this kind of code I keep unit tests written down in a file, because sometimes its different patterns and edge cases that is important and other times it is the combination of those edge cases that is more important. Usually though you will not be aware of the edge cases before launching to production, so you just have to use your tool constantly in order to expose the various errors. When you are not dealing with algorithmic code you are typically dealing with UI problems. In my Pretty Diff tool this kind of testing is very complicated, because it is not simple feature testing but rather the testing of use cases involving the collision of various feature sets. This is difficult because it challenging to be aware of these complicate situations in order to devise the most appropriate unit tests reflecting valid use cases and then remembering to apply this complexity cross browser. I say this is difficult because because awareness of instances of complexity is challenging in and of itself and because applying those instances may or may not reflect valid use cases where in you may miss something simple and obvious in the face of an overstated unit test. The good thing about testing UI is that its more about error suppression than minimizing functional complexity, so this makes it easier to look for problems. With algorithms you are inherently creating bugs just by extending the offerings of the product, which makes finding the problems more difficult and solving algorithmic problems can be itself the introduction of other algorithmic problems, which are called regression bugs. The difference with regression bugs on the UI side is that its just more error suppression presuming you can identify the proper unit tests. On the algorithmic side it can take months or years to find all the proper unit tests that allow for full identification of regression. I have also found that writing things in my personal time that more ambitious or complex than is required of me by my employer gets me close to calling myself a badass that I could never achieve in the context of any employment. Set your personal objectives to the level of crazy ambitious and be determined about following through with it and test the hell out of it. If you get good at testing complex stuff in your personal time you will slowly get very good and very fast in the writing and testing of less ambitious code for your employer. For work I primarily write code for A/B tests on a very prominent website. If you have never done this sort of work before I can tell you know its what separates the men from the boys. This is perhaps the most challenging JavaScript you will ever write, which creates unique sets of challenges with regards to development and testing. My pattern so far is as follows: 1) Use my personal knowledge of the product 2) Receive business requirements of the product from the product managers and app developers. In a complex environment with a long history you will never get everything, because it is unlikely that everything has been documented and that every participant is still employed in the company. So, for edge cases this bit of information can in some cases be a complete mystery. 3) Create a pattern of development that fits the unique niche of A/B testing. 4) Write up test cases. I am really bad about actually writing things down because it takes time and reduces my productivity. This is bad because its not doing myself any favors into the future and it is definitely not helping the team. This is important because it compensates for the short comings mentioned in point number 2. A/B testing is uniquely challenging because there is no premature optimization. There is only optimization. I need to be able to inflict changes to the page before the user can see the original page, and some of these changes amount of the complete redrawing of content on very heavy pages. This means you cannot use any frameworks, because they are too slow to execute and you have to waste time waiting for them to be fed into the interpreter. If you need use of a framework to achieve complex results on mystery pages then you are entirely incapable of doing this job. There are two complicating technical factors that you have to know going in: * You have no control over state, so page state or carry over between pages has to be done via cookie if you are supporting IE7 or older browser. * Timing is absolutely crucial to minimize or eliminate flicker. This is why you cannot use frameworks. * Your tests cannot timeout in IE7 or older browser. This is why there is no such thing as premature optimization in more complicated tests and also why you cannot use frameworks. * Everything is a one-off and every page is amazingly different from the next so, in A/B testing you will not be writing automated QA tests. Its all manual, so I hope you have a very solid list of test cases to go through manually. Unfortunately, A/B testing opens possibilities for errors that were never intended in the original design of the product. A/B test code is basically a one-off throw away hack that executes on top of an existing product that seeks to alter user behavior in a measurably significant way. Since you the developer cannot be aware of all possible conditions and all possible user behavior and you have a rapid timeline to keep up with I have found the best thing to do is to get other people involved. The more people attempting to use and break your code the better. Consider this kind of complexity coding in such conditions will likely result in an initial high fail rate. You have to grow thick skin and just watch yourself fail in testing, fix it, and watch it fail again due to regression. If this makes you sad then you are liability and should not perform in this role. You will fail more than you succeed in writing perfect code. The true measure of success is failing internally, but eventually releasing code that does not fail externally, and that is a team effort. If you try to go it alone because you have an ego then you probably will fail and rightly so. Get other people involved with the intention of breaking your code hoping that they do so you discover and resolve as many bugs as possible before you release anything.
I would recommend http://javascriptmvc.com . Model layer works with JSON out of the box, but since it uses jQuery for AJAX requests it is easy to modify it to consume XML services.
Cool. If you feel like it, go ahead and take over the animation section. ;) The wiki is open for anyone really. It's nice to a place where to look at when you're looking for a library for some specific purpose. :)
Your attempt to turn this discussion into an HTML5 vs Flash argument because both technologies do this or not that, is just pathetic. Why don't you head over to /r/gaming and argue about xbox's and playstations instead of trying to corrupt this discussion with your fanboy antics.
rakion es el mejor
Terrific. Thank you!
Thats good and all.. But the site aren't following HTML5 standards. /picky
Here is the thing about HTML5. Many users who are not technical want it and are willing to give up a lot to get it. This is very rare in the industry. Technical change is almost always driven by the people who create it. Now we are seeing people willing to put time and money into projects whose sole purpose is to replace applications using flash or silverlight because it must work on their ipad. Furthermore, they get excited when it does. This, more than anything, mean the slow demise of flash.
&gt; Your attempt to turn this discussion into an HTML5 vs Flash argument because both technologies do this or not that, is just pathetic. Perhaps you should actually read the article. Go read the article first and then explain how I am off subject.
Yes! Does the project have a website?
We used to do functional tests with Cucumber, but the more we invested in it, the more we realized how much of a maintenance nightmare it was. Now we test on a BDD level with JUnit and WebDriver, which cut test execution speed in half, and debugging and development time by god knows how much. On a unit level, we use jsunit2-maven-plugin (we're a Java shop, so we use maven to build stuff). I'm looking for an alternative though, since most of our code is Coffeescript, I'd like to have a low-friction Coffeescript unit test framework..
I think this is an impossible problem to solve with regex, especially since the work is done in 2 passes: 1 for `//` comments and another for `/* */` comments. I think they need to be tokenized and parsed for proper identification. 
Do you think you can provide some test strings to show when it fails? I can't parse them in one go with one regex so I had to resort to using two. The eventual goal is to cover as many use cases as possible with just one function call.
Inside rhino: js&gt; a = {'desc': 'this is a json // but valid // I guess'} js&gt; s = a.toSource() js&gt; _removeComments(s) ({desc:"this is a json Invalid JSON now (which is why using regex in this case is not a good idea and a tokenizer would do a better job).
Hehehe I love how my coworker has a ton of books and Javascript: The Good Parts is easily the thinnest book on his shelf.
This whole thread is just full of win.
The problem I can imagine with the RegEx approach is that it does not (and possibly can not?) take context into consideration. Suppose the comment characters are in a string, rather then a comment, the regex gladly strips them out, which is wrong. Example: _removeComments('{"a":"/\*test\*/"}')
Your current code will cover _most_ of the common uses, but the other uses are going to the problematic ones. Juliob points out one, and there's some other caveats such as the ones [outlined here](http://ostermiller.org/findcomment.html). Any time you have nested and/or mixed comments, yours will likely have problems.
Good catch. Now I'm not really sure how to go about solving this one... :(
Want something funnier to work with? s = {'a': 'fu/*rther down', 'b': 'ti*/ck /*', 'c': '*/ regex'} (I reckon two things: 1) The case of such strings appearing is pretty rare and 2) I'm freaking lazy to break the last part and make it a better surprise)
Maybe if I removed all strings and then perform the removal of comments, and after that re-insert the strings back into it? I can always use some funky tags to refer to the exact locations those strings were in the first place.
That'll work, if you can cover something like this: var s = 'foo' + bar + foo() + '/* ' + this.or.that() + '*/\ bar//*\ '.replace(/\/\/\/*/ /* here be a real "comment" */, ';//\ /*\ */') + "'\"\"// */\'''/*'"; p.s. I recommend just going with a tool that strips comments properly, which I presume projects like Uglify.js and Google's Closure tools can handle. 
I was kind of hoping that there might be a lightweight way to doing it rather than relying on closure compiler or uglify. The primary purpose was to allow c-styled comments in JSON (let's not debate this for now) files, and initially I thought that regex was the end-all to this. I'll get back to the drawing board next week. Again, thanks for all the example cases. They're incredibly helpful!
Take a look at qooxdoo.. it's pretty beefy to build js apps. 
If there is a consistent pattern of bad houses being built with hammers, and if it takes a carpenter of such exceptional skill and patience to build a house with a hammer that's equivalent to a house built by a strictly average carpenter with a pneumatic nail gun -- then yes, I would not want a house built with a hammer and would advocate for people not trying to build houses with hammers.
I read the article, and I will explain how you are off subject. This article is not about whether Flash or HTML5 is the superior technology. The article is about the current state of the audio and video HTML5 elements, and why the current state is inadequate. The article does make a comparison between how the HTML5 audio and video APIs are being developed in comparison to how Flash is being developed, and it makes some good points. The article isn't discussing conspiracy theories. It is factual that Flash is developed by a single company - Adobe. It is factual that HTML5 standards are developed as a community effort, with a large part of the development taking place between major browser vendors. It is factual that the W3C Audio Working Group dicussions haven't led to a consensus on how the Audio API should be handled. The author's argument is that the audio API should provide low level access to audio hardware in order to let developers have the most freedom over development possibilities. The author's argument is not that HTML5 media is superior to Flash, or that HTML5 media elements are not used enough on the web. **EDIT:** Or perhaps you understood "HTML5 media" as meaning "News in the media about HTML5". This is not what the article is about, either.
Can you elaborate on the use of GAE as a CDN? Was the cost of using app engine to serve static files affected by Google's rate hike?
I put JSLint into my builds. It integrates nicely with Maven (there's a plugin)
[Release notes](http://livedocs.dojotoolkit.org/releasenotes/1.7) Dgrid looks good - will be interesting to actually try it out. I found the 4KB claim was a little bit hard to believe though - from a quick Google it looks like [that doesn't include base or core packages](http://dojo-toolkit.33424.n3.nabble.com/How-to-create-smallest-possible-dojo-build-td3554327.html).
Ugh.. PDF. That number needs a few more zeros
From the bottom of the page: "You need to register to earn this money!" ... FU, why?
[Relevant](http://code.google.com/p/xee/source/browse/XeePhotoshopLoader.m?r=f51d59ef6cca3ea75c12feea002db11cda64b6a2#107) and [previous discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/8ejiz/psd\_is\_not\_my\_favourite\_file\_format/)
Well, they probably want to know where to send the money..
They don't exactly ask for addresses on registration. This couldn't be handled with a simple form?
You're right. We should probably stick with plain text flat websites. This newfangled javascript is a bunch of hooey. 
No I don't think so. The cost of GAE as CDN is $0.12/GByte. 1GByte/day free.
I never said anything of the sort -- plenty of sites use JS to great effect without breaking the back button. You are making a straw man argument. 
&gt; This article is not about whether Flash or HTML5 is the superior technology. I agree. Its about this: "Just today I learned about the Occupy Flash movement. While my heart yearns for the quick death of Flash, it still holds the edge in multimedia on the web, and for good reasons. All the major streaming platforms still use Flash to stream their content." I think you completely misunderstood what I wrote.
Thanks - this is good feedback. I'll put a form right there on the in the next iteration..
No, I am making an argument that should be easy to agree with (that JS is useful, the web can change, etc.) which should be easy to see how it can be extended to make your argument seem silly.
That's still a straw man argument. At no point did I say that JS wasn't useful. My argument is that you can use as much JS as you want and extend the web to your heart's content, but in the process of doing so you'd better not remove or break basic functionality that has existed in browsers since the beginning, like the ability to get back to where you were last by clicking 'back'. What's silly is the notion that millions of people should have to put up with this degraded UI experience and the resulting frustration for no reason other than to simplify the life of a handful of back-end programmers, and possibly shaving 100 ms or so off page load time.
Well, PDF is not PSD, but neither one is my favorite file format. At least PDF is an open standard!
The main topic of the article is not about how flash still holds the edge in multimedia on the web and how all major streaming platforms still use Flash to stream their content. True, there are two sentences in the article that discuss these things, as you've quoted (and as part of a bigger argument/topic - the actual focus of the article). It's very possible I misunderstood what you originally wrote, because admittedly after first reading it I was left thinking ".... what?" However, I think you completely disregarded what I wrote. The article is about the current state of the HTML5 audio and video APIs (mostly audio), why the author thinks they are in an inadequate state, and what the author believes should be done to remedy the situation.
Yeah that is currently what I do but it gets annoying after time.
Using `document.write()` overwrites the HTML on the page. If you want to output text, make a `div` or `p` element and give it an `id`, which you can write to using: document.getElementById('putyouridhere').innerHTML += "Text to insert";
Your canvas is likely covering the whole page (height, width, 100%). So you can't see anything else. As darkane said, don't use document write. Put a div on the page you want to write to. Try and familiarize yourself with a developer console. (developer tools in chrome, ie has one, firebug for ff) They can help you resolve things like this very quickly. You can inspect the structure of the html, as well type javascript right in the console and execute it directly against the page. (tighter feed back loop) Also, ditch all the bold, that's obnoxious.
Yeah, sorry to burst your bubble, but unless you have some pretty firm guarantees about your source data (such as no nested comments, no comments in strings, etc.) then you won't be able to use simple regex. The sad part is that I'm having this exact argument with my build engineer, but I don't think he comprehends yet that the magnitude of the problem... EDIT: I assume that you [read this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/244777/can-i-comment-a-json-file)? No magic bullets, but interesting discussion. EDIT 2: I worm-holed in the SO link and ended up with [this from Crockford](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/json/message/152): &gt; JSON does not have comments. A JSON encoder MUST NOT output comments. A JSON decoder MAY accept and ignore comments. &gt; Comments should never be used to transmit anything meaningful. That is what JSON is for.
jQuery has been removed.
The feature has been removed.
The feature has been removed.
Nice effect! On my browser (Chrome 15 on Mac) it looks like about 3-4 fps; is that a deliberate part of the animation or a performance issue?
Yeah, I need JSON to have comments because I use them for configuration files. The key here is that it shouldn't be transmitted WITH comments, like Crockford says. Don't think there ever will be a magic bullet for this, but at least this episode had intrigued me enough to want to dig into uglify's code and see how it's all done. :P
It doesn't seem to use the gpu much, or at least be heavily cpu bound. I got about 3fps on my laptop, pentium dual core (dothan based) and an intel gma somethingerother. I tried it on my desktop thinking it'd run a lot better, but I only seemed to be getting about 10 fps there, unless it just looks that way at least, and that's with a c2d that's about 150-180% faster than my laptop and a gtx 460. Oh, also with chromium on the desktop vs firefox, but if anything chromium has always ran webgl things faster, unless something changed recently with firefox I'm not aware of.
Give the [Jasmine-Maven-Plugin](http://github.com/searls/jasmine-maven-plugin) a go. It supports coffeescript, javascript, headless and browser based versions of the test runner and outputs JUnit xml formats :) 
its has evolved down to 79b https://gist.github.com/1400509
Truly awesome. I'm especially impressed by the 12 fps I get on my old machine. What about an **encoder**? I think all browsers will eventually support WebM playback, and then it would be awesome to be able to encode stuff to the right format straight from the internet. I know we can already [boot linux emulators](http://bellard.org/jslinux/), so can we use that somehow to run an encoder on it?
This is not WebGL.
Thanks for the tip! Will make sure to check that out.
Thanks, that works great :)
Very nice ! It runs fairly slow on my laptop in firefox. I tried some things to speed it up: You can remove the calls to cos and sin: var hyp; var dist; if (mouse.down == true){ hyp = Math.sqrt((mouse.x - p.x) * (mouse.x - p.x) + (mouse.y - p.y) * (mouse.y - p.y)); dist = 400 / hyp; } else { dist = 0; hyp = 0; } //Where the magic happens! p.x += (mouse.down ? -dist * (mouse.x - p.x) / hyp : 0) + (p.pX - p.x) * 0.05; p.y += (mouse.down ? -dist * (mouse.y - p.y) / hyp : 0) + (p.pY - p.y) * 0.05; Also, rendering without antialiasing by calling Math.round on p.x and p.y seems to make a difference (at the cost of uglifying it though). These two seem to gain a few fps, but still not smooth. The string concat can be moved out of the loop, by storing the style info. However this doesn't appear to make much difference. The main cost in the loop appears to be the actual call to fillRect. The only other optimisation I can think of would be to sort by colour, construct a disconnected path for each colour and fill, in the hope that the penalty for this is lower than making separate fillRect calls. However that's a big change and a bit of a gamble. *Edit:* I tried the optimisation and sorting by colour and aggregating adjacent colours into the same fill does speed things up considerably on FF. Losing 3 bits of colour depth makes it reasonably fast. 
Oh, don't know why I thought it was, that explains that.
They're actually called pie menus or radial menus: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_menu
[Lalit's script](http://www.lalit.org/lab/javascript-css-font-detect/)
Cool stuff
This is awesome. I think it would be cool to have a demo with sub-menus--this would also be an interesting way to plot a network graph (like Facebook friends or Twitter followers).
Ahh, those sound much better. And I like the visual of a solid circle for the menu, I wonder how hard it would be to code something like that.
interesting, i hadn't seen that one before. i like how his uses a larger font; higher resolution does make sense, i might have to do that in mine. i notice, though, that his doesn't test against multiple controls (he just uses sans)...
That's funny, I actually prefer your version of the concept. Nice work!
Thanks! If I tackle that solid circle thing I'd make it an option, maybe work in some elements that can be styled to achieve the look.
And when I was 12, I was just scratching the skin of programming with Pascal... this kid owned 99% of us.
I love them, pie menus are really nice in general, and these have a nice feel.
Good work. I didn't know about path until I saw this. Our "tech-saavy" generation is so fucking narcissistic. 
Submenus are an interesting idea, I'll have to look into that.
I think the rotation of the icon from a '+' to an 'x' should be a 45° transform. It looks like it's maybe 405°, certainly more than 45° anyway.
That's a styling specific to the example. What I do is add a "circleMenu-open" class to the container UL, then style the first li element to spin. This styling is up to the implementer to apply.
Did you look into S3 and if so how did it compare to GAE?
I would really like this feature. I instantly thought of hacking submenus on by just making a new instance positioned in the right spots, but of course it would be better to have it handled inside the plugin.
what's the license for this?
Whoops, forgot to include that in the README. I'm going with the [WTFPL license](http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/).
Since it's meant to work with (un)ordered lists it certainly makes sense to handle nested lists. The tricky part is overlaps, I'd have to make sure the submenu doesn't overlap the parent menu, or maybe provide some CSS class hooks that'd allow for the parent menu's other options to fade or hide when the submenu comes out. Any opinions or ideas on how that should look/work?
I can see both cases being useful, so ideally it would be an option. That said, I'm blanking on the geometry for finding the intersections of two circles when one circle's center is on the edge of the other... So I would say start with the fade/disable option and a CSS class would be the easiest way to do that. Edit: this might be useful http://paulbourke.net/geometry/2circle/
Nope, we were familiar with GAE, so we had it set up in 5 minutes. And so far, with about 3 page views monitored for JavaScript errors per second by Muscula, everything is looking fine for our businesmodel. The price of the CDN is not a factor with what we're paying. If that changes we'll investigate. As for the webapp itself, the price of the CDN will never be a factor, each user loads so small amounts of data from CDN.
That's good that you eat your own dog food. :) Looks useful, I signed up for beta access.
Id give anything for raphael to work better on android :-( Great demo
One issue is that when you are building without JS, you end up building sections where being ajaxy is optional (such as a comment submit on an article or forum) in a non-Ajaxy way. To then have it ajaxy (which is usually always better), you end up having to redo some of that section, when you could have simply done it that way in the first place.
I have never used mootools, so I'd be interested in why you prefer it?
Make the submenu items be in an outer circle?
For stuff coming with a browser, definitely a big no. But if it's built on top of well known and stable CDNs, such as a browser more heavily caching the Google APIs and Google Web Fonts, then I don't see why this couldn't be done. That could work.
That sounds pretty awesome, actually. I imagine for larger circles the outer circle could be condensed to take up no more than, say a 90° segment, so the user wouldn't have to move their mouse too far for each successive level.
If you could put curved text in there it might be nice, too.
Are you the same Zikes that used to write GreaseMonkey scripts on deviantART?
I would leave the clicked item in place and have the submenu centered around it. I think you should fade the parent menu by half, and just include a "back" or "close" button in the submenu.
Thanks, man. I appreciate this. Good work.
I tried to figure this out but could not, I'm commented so I can come back later and see if anyone has provided something insightful.
Regarding the no ORM part - notice that we are using MongoDB which doesn't have joins. A record in MongoDB is called a document and can have sub-documents which you would be using instead of referring to another collection (MongoDB equivalent of a table). This allows you to organize your data in a much more logical fashion without having to denormalize. *The one man backend team mentioned in the post* :)
&gt;When you start creating an app which works by accumulating state from different users of the app (eg. reviews, social network) or just plainly data-heavy (eg. personal financing app), then you would have to start storing state in the server and this architecture becomes just like any other architectures with their own scalability problems. I must disagree with you here. The app being described in the post is quite data heavy - some users get 7-800kb of raw data from the server, but thanks to gzip the actual amount of traffic is a lot smaller. It is the same with accumulated state really - just a stream of compressed json, perhaps mixed with websockets for seamless updating data. *The one man backend team mentioned in the post* :)
What has to be re-implemented when adding the AJAX request? Use the same backend and validation logic, for instance on a form, but make the GET/POST request with $.ajax() instead of a page reload. Where is the duplicated effort? This becomes even easier when you know that adding AJAX will eventually happen, so you can account for that during step one.
Yep! Working on a new one, actually.
You might want to use [this regular expression instead](http://www.ex-parrot.com/pdw/Mail-RFC822-Address.html).
I'm not the best at regex but this worked for me. var emailformat = /\^[a-z0-9._-]+@gmail\\.com$/i; [] brackets in regex are used for single characters so that's why [gmail] won't work. Also you need to escape your periods in regex if you want them to be interpreted as a literal period. Same thing goes for [com]. Since you know you want your email to always end in, @gmail.com you can just simply write @gmail\\.com. Also the /i at the end makes the regex not case-sensitive which allows you to remove the A-Z in the first part of the regex. Your if statement should be if (!emailformat.test(document.form.usernametxtbx.value)) alert("Invalid email address"); Hope this helps.
Upvote for good explanation, but please people... as someone who uses + in my email address all the time, remember: The plus symbol is a valid email character! (myemail+emailCategoryOrSiteName@gmail.com is useful, valid and awesome.)
Thank you, this worked perfectly. edit. nvm
http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_obj_regexp.asp Please don't use the solution he posted without adding support for the + symbol. Use: var emailformat = / ^ [a-z0-9._-+]+@gmail\.com$/i;
1) [gmail]+ will allow any combination of the characters gmail for an infinite length, this is not what you want. This would match test.account@maigl.com Just writing gmail would be better. 2) [com] matches 1 character from com. test.account@gmail.c would be matched. just writing com would be better. 3) gmail addresses can have + in them. 4) You can't use an equality operator to compare a string and a regex. You have to use one of the builtin functions to do so. Study this tutorial. http://www.javascriptkit.com/jsref/regexp.shtml 5) Some characters like '.', '+' and '-' need to be escaped if you are trying to match those characters as they have functions in regex. The code should be something more like this var emailFormat = /^[a-zA-Z0-9\.\_\-\+]+@gmail\.com$/; if (!emailFormat.test(document.form.usernametxtbx.value)) alert("Invalid email address"); EDIT:formatting
I would imagine that rhe `Sandbox` constructor is just a wrapper for a module, possibly implementing an event emitter/registrar. Seriously though, I wouldn't get hung up on the code. I've been to one of Zakas' presentations and the general gist of it is that each module (or each "thing" within your app/interface) should be "sandboxed". So, for example, if I have a navigation module (essentially, a menu), I should be able to slot it in wherever I want. It shouldn't have to worry about where it is because it is entirely independent. **From what I recall, Zakas' example of a module was the weather box on the Yahoo homepage** This sandboxed module, presumably, can depend on there being some basic utility methods available so it can do its job. E.g. the module could assume that jQuery is loaded. Each sandboxed module has no knowledge of its existence in the bigger picture. It doesn't know about or rely on there being other modules loaded. The Application core, I guess, is the bit which initalises all these modules. So the core is the only bit that knows about all the modules. IMHO, it's all a bit of a fuss over not very much. The KEY is to separate your concerns so that, if you need to remove or add something in the future, you can do so easily.
Thanks for the heads up. I will keep that in mind for future references. 
I don't think this works.
Very cool and works nicely on my Android (and most likely iOS). I think this may be what we want for configuring a mapping interface I'm working on. Overlay these over the corners of a map scaled to 100% and use both with a mouse and a touch-screen. Now, does anyone know of a slider which we could position between the corner-menus and which would work both with a mouse and a finger? We could then f.ex. have circle menus in the top-left and top-right corners for selecting a base map and an overlay, and a slider between them to control the opacity.
It is possible to use the != operator instead of using the .test function?
To propose an answer to my own question, [dragdealer JS](http://code.ovidiu.ch/dragdealer/) looks good.
Hell, no, that can't handle comments in the email address.
I have done almost the exact same thing where I work, the main difference being that I launch everything through maven instead of ant. Also, I wouldn't call this a "QA environment", since its really just running all of your automated tests. But that's just semantics I suppose.
&gt; I wonder how well it fits with building user interactions / interfaces? Do you mean GUI widgets? I don't think it does any of that, but you could see by reading the documentation.
I do the exact same thing! I have email+netflix@gmail.com or email+hulu@gmail.com so I can easily create filters, but I was just going off what he had in his original example. Having the + is a must!!
When you say "best performing" what do you mean, exactly? Easier to find the desired command? Fastest to navigate?
Escaping isn't necessary inside `[]` clauses: /[.]/.test('a') &gt; false /./.test('a') &gt; true /[.]/.test('.') &gt; true
Please, please, **please** do the minimum amount of validation (for e-mail addresses). You want to help the user, not frustrate them. (Many people here, including myself, use `+` in e-mail addresses, and many validation forms disallow them because they are too restrictive.) If all you want is "is this a gmail e-mail I can try and send an e-mail to", use this: /^[^@]+@(gmail|googlemail)\.com$/i.test(email) Even this I would try to never use, though.
&gt; because he hasn't actually taught us anything about the swap function yet. That's probably because he wants you to actually write the swap function. He appears to have explicitly explained every single detail of how to do this entire, tiny assignment. I predict you will do very poorly in this class, unless you find some way of getting other people to do your work for you.
I don't think so. This is because the *emailformat* variable is a Regexp object, and the value from the text box is a string, and so comparing an object to a string is impossible. You're not comparing if two things are equal, you're testing to see if a string matches a pattern in an object. If you could use == or !=, then two strings which matched the regular expression would theoretically have to equal each other too, which makes no sense.
You are the reason I use noscript.
Whenever I hear about HCI I shudder. What about book layout, should we call that HBI? And I love academia. I just want to know why it's okay to let interface design, and thus the design process, be co-opted by the enterprise, mutilating it into a term like "UX", which can then be bound and gagged by papers and quantitative research. I hate calling myself a "UX designer" because it reminds me of the kind of thinking that encourages staying in-paradigm, stifling innovation. The pregnant potential for innovation is what brought me to new media in the first place; what makes a "pie menu" so important that it gets its own paper?
Elaborate?
That you're using XML web services probably isn't enough info to recommend one thing over another. The approaches often depend on the type of data you've got and what you're doing with it. E.g. If you're consuming DocBook and converting that to HTML then XSLT would be a good fit, however if you've got a simple key:value list in XML then you might just deal with the nodes as (ugh) W3C DOM objects or XPath selectors. I think jQuery can select from XML in pretty much the same way you'd select HTML documents so that might be an option. Don't use E4X because it's poorly supported, and deprecated in Firefox. I personally prefer Backbone over Sp**r**outCore or Cappuccino. Handlebars.js is a fairly good templating engine for JavaScript.
Just the same old Facebook Twitter "enough self-importance to publish the minutiae of my life" argument. It makes sense that software developers would be inspired to create a program like Path, right? Indirect communication based on loosely coupled (life) event dispatching? That's the ideal communication for a data architect. But in real life, people who tell you everything about themselves without caring about who's listening are called "pricks". There are some great and useful things about social media as a concept, but Path in particular seems built to encourage a style of communication that, in my mind, is petty, and at best irrelevant to good, healthy relationships.
http://www.regular-expressions.info/email.html Enough said.
Hopefully you've already gotten in touch with the admins about this?
Full link please?
You could use the URL hash (#). The advantage to it is to be able to change the address (hence values) without reloading the page (and restarting your app). You'll have something like that: http://localhost/games#gamename=123&amp;gametype=456 You access the hash with window.location.hash (read/write). You can use a split on "&amp;" and "+" to create your arrays and use the values. Finally, you can listen to change in the hash and trigger function with an event listener on "hashchange". Just so you know, Twitter and Gawker got quite some backlash for using this technique. It can be a hassle to users if all your cases are not handled (unit testing is important) and it can be bad for SEO.
I'm guessing it's probably to do with RES as it's to do with a call to reddits api. http://i.imgur.com/ant1z.jpg
why use a hash? they asked specifically about accessing a value in the querystring (after the ?) and window.location.search has the querystring.
We will try it again with the new SVG feature! Thank you
You could get all the values after the question mark like this var search, params, i; search = window.location.search.replace(/^./, '').split('&amp;'); params = {}; for(i = 0; i &lt; search.length; i++) { var tokens = search[i].split('='); params[tokens[0]] = tokens[1]; } To which you can then get gamename by using *params['gamename']*
Clearly avast is being dumb. It's just r/javascript/top as json like the URI says.
PDF is quickly becoming the most exploited media format. It would be really convenient to read PDF files using a JavaScript interpreter, but what a security nightmare for most users, or a very convenient way to simultaneous inject code into Windows, iOS, and OSX. http://securitywatch.pcmag.com/apple/284022-malicious-pdfs-execute-code-without-a-vulnerability http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9176117/PDF_exploits_explode_continue_climb_in_2010 
Because it is the prefered way with JS for reasons I have cited. You can of course use the querystring about the same way if you don't care about event listening. 
That's fair, and useful. Other interesting terms I've picked up from Hci are "path to completion ", "decision fatigue", and the concept of "orientation" (within the application). It's certainly not a *useless* or *uninteresting* field of study... it's just dubious to me because it's not design, exactly. I shouldn't ignore it though; that is, admittedly, the easy way out.
For the past week, I've been seeing the same warning using ESET NOD32. I've just been too lazy to do anything about it. I also have RES installed.
I think the assumption is you follow people you actually care about.
In your experience, is that how social media works? I contend that Path won't break that trend by virtue of how it is designed, but I'd like to be proved wrong. I'm not *too* invested in being a cynic.

Wow. It's been a while since I saw a UI widget that I was genuinely impressed with. It's quite fast.
[Here's an article that gets passed around a lot](http://jqueryvsmootools.com/) But I use Mootools simply because when I started learning js, I was working at a dev shop that used Mootools. I haven't looked back since. Were I to critique jQuery at all, I'd have to have actually used it, and since I haven't, I don't. I have been meaning to, however... **Edit**: I *try* not to critique jQuery, since I have no applicable experience with it. From what I have read, and from the article above, jQuery leans more heavily on DOM manipulation, and allows you to get great effects done quickly, be it simple animations, or more complex animations involving multiple elements. Mootools is more of a layer on top of the existing js in order to mitigate some of the weaknesses of javascript, and introduce some programming constructs not inherent in js (such as class based inheritance) From the article: &gt; Part of this consideration is the notion of a framework vs a toolkit. MooTools is a framework that attempts to implement JavaScript as it should be (according to MooTools' authors). The aim is to implement an API that feels like JavaScript and enhances everything; not just the DOM. jQuery is a toolkit that gives you an easy to use collection of methods in a self-contained system designed to make the DOM itself more pleasant. It just so happens that the DOM is where most people focus their effort when writing JavaScript, so in many cases, jQuery is all you need. 
I've been doing something similar to this for a few years. We borrowed an older term that I think was originally used by Raible to describe it. "Service Oriented Front End Architecture". Basically SOA principles applied at the User Interface layer. We Google Closure Templates for templating in the browser (simple template system that compiles down to javascript functions/classes), and a very lightweight home grown MVC implementation for navigation. Basically the framework parses everything after the hashtag as a URL and maps that to a dynamically loaded controller class. Don't want to threadjack, but it's nice to bump into someone else on reddit that gets the advantages of the architecture (too many people on here are stuck in the past and refuse to see the advantages offered by this kind of architecture). They're perfectly okay with a web app that re-requests the entire page when you click a button that shows 20% new content/80% the same as the last page (and re-templates, re-reads data from backends, sends the entire document over the network again, and redraws/re-executes JS in the browser), but they'll throw a fit even if the page works in IE6, FF, Chrome, and every modern smartphone because it doesn't work on their browser where they disabled Javascript.
Got ya. If you haven't seen it here's a really nice CSS/HTML (no JS) version of the path menu: http://lab.victorcoulon.fr/css/path-menu/

That's actually not one question but many. There are many variables here. Where do you want the information to be stored? If you want it on the server, then you'll need to use AJAX to send it. You'll need to work out when that happens: you could do it when focus is lost (e.g. they tab or click away from the dialog), or when they click a button, or on a timeout that detects when typing has stopped for 'n' seconds. Or you could skip AJAX and make it a plain form that is submitted. You'll also need to work out how the page is rendered when they come back. You could have the server populate the HTML with the data as part of the response, or you could send the HTML with the fields blank and have JavaScript dynamically fetch the data on page load and insert it into the fields. It depends on how you have your back end setup, and whether you want to be serving static HTML with some kind of JSON/XML API, or just serving dynamic pages. Or you could do it entirely browser-side, so that the data is never sent to or stored on the server. But still, there are several options. A cookie is one option, but there's also HTML5 LocalStorage, or Flash LocalStorage, although the latter is considered kind of unsavory to use. 
After looking at the source of the `/.json` link, I'd imagine it's from [this submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/mk1u8/i_found_code_in_my_files_i_did_not_add_what_does/) - [look at the .json](http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/top/.json), it's full of evil Javascript.

I have the same problem with MS Security Essentials (using RES).
It was framework-agnostic in its early days, moved to dojo for syntactical sugar. Took that sentence out now, thanks for the catch.

This is just great. Just a superb interface idea.
As someone that tried and utterly failed to implement the sandbox ( https://github.com/posabsolute/stackJS ) idea I would say that zakas sandbox is over engineering is 95% of cases. Most of use will never work with a team bigger than 5 js dev and when you compare that to yahoo team... The important point in this whole idea is to separate your concerns, use events emitter so your modules are not dependent of each other.
This is pretty cool, seems like Raph should handle some of this natively, though.

&gt; The article is about the current state of the HTML5 audio and video APIs (mostly audio), why the author thinks they are in an inadequate state, and what the author believes should be done to remedy the situation. Sure, but the author also tacitly admits that the W3C is extremely slow to move on these things - audio in particular - and basically any reader can/should draw the conclusion that at least until that issue is settled, Flash is indeed a superior technology choice for many use cases. Yes, he wants to see HTML5 catch up and make the prior statement untrue - but there's no denying reading his article that he agrees with that statement *today* and for a decent chunk of the foreseeable future.
The plot thickens..
ya i thought the amount you had to drag to get it to snap to the next page was a bit much too, i'd most likely make it less if I was to use it
Finally something to run my old Turing machine games on!
Wow, this is some really handy stuff! I can see this being useful in form validation, moving elements on a page, selecting with keyboards and even browser-based games. Really great!
It's not an issue with the DOM, or operating systems, or browsers that you can't press more than four keys at a time -- it's actually a problem with how the USB keyboard spec is designed. If you want to be able to press more than four/five keys at a time, you're probably going to be wanting a keyboard connected by a PS/2 port. If you want be able to hit every key on your keyboard and have it register, you'll need a *n-key rollover* keyboard -- one of which I conveniently have (Das Keyboard), and I can assure you your library works for as many keys at a time as I desire :) [Here's a screenshot of me pressing a number of keys at a time](http://i.imgur.com/SnQPb.png). edit: word choice
That's very cool I'm glad it works. I just think that this kind of shit is pathetic. We use the keyboard all the time for everything, as programmers how the hell did we let hardware companies standardize this buggy garbage?
Thanks though I don't recommend using it for form validation. Its a bit overkill for that. Use jQuery's .val() method to check the input on keyup or something.
Hmm, well, I was thinking of validating input by speed, so as to detect spambots from real humans. I think there might be something there :) Edit: Or, basically, validating by input method. No keyboard means no human.
I never agreed or disagreed with the statement that Flash is a superior technology. That was not the intended topic of my posts.
Just because you didnt know how things work, and have always worked, doesn't mean its a bug, or buggy. Also, this type of thing may be "standard" but its not THE standard, or standardized officially in any way. Keyboard manufacturers choose to make their products this way to save money, and offer cheaper wares. Hindsight is 20/20. These types of mechanisms were designed in the late 70's and early 80's, so its really no wonder they didnt for-see super-advanced games and applications that require multiple simultaneous keypresses. Infact... keyboards were originally designed with the express pupurposes of doing just one thing, and doing it well: Typing. In a legitimate typing scenario, when do you ever have to hold down more than 2 keys at once? Never, thats when.... So, thusly, keyboards were designed in the most effecient way possible, which meant no need to handle more than 2-6 keypresses at once. (handling more means a more expensive keyboard with more electronics) You need to direct your anger at Logitech, Microsoft, and any keyboard hardware manufacturers.... they're at fault. Maybe a little bit at consumers too, for buying cheap shit (or perhaps at yourself for not doing your research before buying a keyboard, since there are keyboards out there that do what you want) Not OS's, browsers, or PC hardware manufactures etc. A 2 to 6 key limit is 'standard' but its not 'THE standard'. A manufacture can make a keyboard however they'd like... but if its going to handle much more key presses than the norm, it will be more expensive. And since most people use a keyboard for just typing (not playing games, or using advanced apps), most manufactures aren't going to spend the extra money, and make their product more expensive, for something only a small subset of people use. Buy a keyboard from a reputable company like Das Keyboard, and you can press as many keys as you want. You get what you pay for.
For validating the speed use something like: var lastTime = 0; var minTimeBetweenKeys = 1; document.addEventListener('keydown', function(){ var time = Date.now(); if(lastTime &lt;= time - minTimeBetweenKeys) { lastTime = time; } else { //not human handler logic.... } }); This still may not work because some bots use JavaScript to submit their data. They will actually type the data into the form via fake key press events.
Thanks, you've inspired me to get working on an idea I've had for a while. Good job!
You're better off using cookies or local storage if your URLs aren't maintaining reproducible state.
Really..? What settings do you use for Security Essentials? Do you have a screen-shot. I tried to get it to stop the "top" JS from executing and it wouldn't touch it. I have "real-time protection on" and even turned both lower level threats to delete so it wouldn't "allow" any by accident. I don't know why I really care, just curious what JS would get eaten up by a virus program.. *also I don't want to be browsing the web without using my rubber.
This is good for mobile development, but if I see anyone using this on a desktop experience I'm going to cry.
I'm glad to hear that. Now I'm curious, what are you going to do?
It is a problem when you try to play something like fighting games on a keyboard. For regular typing, is it really that much of an issue? Have you actually suffered at typing because of it? Typically the modifier keys (control, alt, shift) don't block the same way letter and number keys do. And the way they create the matrix for the keys, you can often press quite a few keys as long as they are far enough apart. For instance, on the old Microsoft Natural Elite keyboards, even though it was 2 key rollover (meaning there was a combination of 2 keys you could press that would result in the 3rd key ghosting) I actually could play fighting games if I spread the directions and the attack buttons far enough apart. I have a SteelSeries PS/2 gaming keyboard with n-key rollover and it is amazing for gaming. But I still use an old cheap-o IBM keyboard with 3 key rollover for regular coding because it just works. And I don't feel bad about how dirty I get it from eating at my desk too much.
Lol. thats awesome, but you shouldn't have to do that. Like I've been saying. Typical keyboards are shit, and just because there old doesn't mean its ok.
In my experience old is better than new. It is nice that there are at least 10 key rollover USB keyboards these days. But, in general, I'd take an old cheap PS/2 keyboard over a new USB keyboard any day. 
Thats not my point. I'm saying that old things can still be improved. Age has no baring on quality.
A JavaScript form validation library. Sure, plenty of them exist, but depend on JQuery or Prototype, or just plain haven't been updated recently. I'd also like a more straight forward syntax to validating rather that takes advantage of JSON rather than Validation.dataType = foo, more and more functions to set up a simple validation... I'd also like it to be as modular as possible, so you only take what you need (similar to Modernizr). Plus I'd like to something to work on.
[Please don't link to w3schools.](http://w3fools.com/)
Good to know, thanks. Never really liked w3schools myself, but as the link you posted points out, they're the first result in Google and I was lazy. ;)
I'm going to cover your second question first because I think it can provide some insight into this topic overall. In terms of communication with modules, either between them or to/from the application core...essentially what you're going to end up with is a sort of message/event driven system. One popular system is Pub/Sub. Basically you subscribe to and publish events; it's very similar to events in the DOM API. For example, say you have a file upload web app. One module you may have on pages is an upload widget; another may be a gallery of files the user has uploaded. In terms of application architecture, the goal is to have these modules as decoupled as possible. PubSub allows modules that are completely separate to communicate. Say your upload widget runs a function on upload completion, you can do something like this: function onComplete( evt ) { // upload module specific teardown, etc // .... blah blah code // then PubSub code: Sandbox.publish( "user-upload-complete" ); } Then in your gallery module, you might have a function like this: function init() { // module specific setup // .... blah blah code // then PubSub code: Sandbox.subscribe( "user-upload-complete", galleryModule.refreshGallery ); } Now, whenever an upload is complete the gallery will update it's display. These two modules don't know about each other, they are completely self contained. The upload widget just pushes the event out there...it doesn't matter who is out there listening, it could be nobody or many modules. Likewise with the gallery module; it doesn't know if the upload-complete message will ever be published...it could never be published. Or it could be published by another module...say one that notifies of another user uploading. This is similar to the system Zakas uses in his example, but in PubSub generally the system handles storing and calling the callbacks, where with Zakas' system the messages are sent to the modules and they figure it out themselves. So this brings me to a point some others have made: not all apps need an architecture like Zakas describes. Sometimes just a PubSub system to mostly decouple things is enough. In terms of your question in terms of understanding the architecture, I would say listen to the presentation a few more times. The code in the slides is just intended to be somewhat illustrative. It's not from anything, and not intended to be functional. On top of that it's likely to contain errors. The important part is the idea of the various components. The sandbox is a conceptual thing...as others have noted it will be specific to your application. In Zaka's architecture it handles the message passing, and it provides an interface to the underlying framework. In other words, the modules should be doing their work through the sandbox. If they need to change the DOM, it's through the sandbox for example. The sandbox controls what they can do basically. The sandbox is not even necessarily a single object/function...it's more like an abstraction layer.
Interesting. Any link or demos available ? 
I'm not complaining because I want a better keyboard. I want the public to have good keyboards without having to "vote with there dollars". I'm sure your correct, keyboards are the way they are because most often you don't need more that three keys at a time. This doesn't mean that this is acceptable. If we want good software without limits we need to get rid of hardware limits at least with human interface. Just because something was good in the 80s does not mean It can't be improved today. There is no reason that everyone can have better keyboards. Long story short keyboard interfaces should be simple and predictable. Press key 1, event fires. Let go of key 1 event fires. All regardless of the other keys. That is not to much to ask considering Microsoft has support for multi-touch with 10 inputs.
Something is missing : a variation of the cursor over the icons to indicate that they are buttons and a hand cursor over the rest of the widget to show that sliding is possible. Or maybe it is only for mobile where over isn't available ?
In regard to first one, No - Multiple of $(this) - Multiple of $(ref) Further note: event.preventDefault() is not supported cross browser (certain versions of IE).
I know this too well.
`return false;` in addition to event.preventDefault() is a good idea.
Thanks for the example! Great stuff. Still, your library seems too cool not to use :P
event.preventDefault is actually standardized across browsers in jQuery through the jQuery.Event object, so that's actually fine to use. return false; is unneeded and also cancels other things
Feedback will be appreciated.
I'm not quite sure the first one would work at all, jQuery might be hiding your mistakes though so it seems to work properly. A few lines cut out of context: var ref = $(this).attr('href'); $(ref).attr('style', 'display:none;'); alert($(ref).html()); The first line sets ref to the value of the href. Presumably a URL in string format. Then you try and add an attribute of style="display: none;" to that string, then you alert the innerHtml of that string. I think you need to have a second think about what you what ref to equal, and to differentiate between the value of the href attribute, and the DOM element you are matching. 
This! And do not read w3schools... block it from your google. If you have a question about an API, google "MDN &lt;API&gt;".
We use ant because Jenkins uses ant to run all tasks but that's all just a matter of taste I guess. A colleague of mine wrote that article, I too wouldn't call it a QA environment, there's more to QA than just syntax checking and Unit tests, but it's a good point to start focussing more on QA for javascript front end development.
Actually, the value of ref should be a string starting with "#", which *could* be an ID of another element on the page (&lt;a href="#foo"&gt;Go to Foo&lt;/a&gt;) but this is certainly not guaranteed. Anyway, assuming it is an ID, $(ref) will be a jQuery collection containing the element with that ID, so there's no problem calling .attr() and .html() on it.
Good point, I misunderstood how it's meant to work. If I was going to recreate this functionality then I would simply use the ABBR tag. The link and the popup text would be contained in the same place and seamless degradation without any extra work. Also you wouldn't need to go about hiding the tips. 
Abbr is a good idea, but I had in mind more text. If you follow the link to lh2.html you can see that I use jQuery's dialog in stead of alert. Then I can put more complex stuff like forms and links in the modal.
Thanks for your comment. Could you explain why multiple uses of $(this) and $(ref) would be a problem? Sorry, I'm new to this.
because jQuery has to work a bunch of stuff out when you do $(anything); so it's better to say: var jqThis = $(this); var jqRef = $(ref); and then use `jqThis` etc everywhere else in your code. Call the expensive function once and store the results rather than re-calling it each time.
So it's an efficiency consideration. Thanks!
as a large chunk of pixels it isn't much intuitive, I understand it's just a demo/toy but a different visualization may improve it considerably.
an hourglass with sand effect would be better.
Baffled that the author chose 300x288 over 360x240. Ten lines makes an hour, and it could be shaded for easy visualization.

If you need somethings more complete, I've implemented [Python like advanced string formatting in JavaScript](http://haineault.com/blog/58/) about 3 years ago: * [Source code](http://code.google.com/p/jquery-utils/source/browse/trunk/src/jquery.strings.js) * [Documentation](http://code.google.com/p/jquery-utils/wiki/StringFormat)
Umm, am I being stupid? sprintf is not defined. 
I highly recommend Flot. I use it a ton. http://code.google.com/p/flot/
Nope. It's one of the glaring omissions from Javascript.
What's the difference in this and websockets? Are websockets for web sites, and these are supposed to be some sort of socket-support specifically for extensions?
What about leap seconds???
Nicely done. It reminds me of the never-ending zoom effect in Limitless.
 $(ref).attr('style', 'display:none;'); is nasty, just do: $(ref).hide(); Also, you can make it smaller by getting rid of the hash checks, you could use a better selector: $('a[href^=#]').lilHelper();
I fail to see how the ABBR tag would make sense here. Also, if Javascript is disabled, the anchor still points to the content div, so things will still 'work'. I much prefer tallpapab's solution.
Seems rather wordy for an _introduction_. Don't get me wrong, I think it was very well written, but it seems like overkill if you're just trying to introduce something. IMO, an introduction should be an executive summary with a few lines of code, at most; you're trying to introduce a new concept, but what you have here seems it'd be more like a "dive into JS native file management" than an intro. Consider [Chrome's announcement of the web sockets feature (from '09)](http://blog.chromium.org/2009/12/web-sockets-now-available-in-google.html). A couple paragraphs, a few lines of code, and that's it. Just saying, that there is entirely too much text for me to read there to simply acquaint myself. Aside from the title, The blog itself is easy to read and otherwise presented nicely, code samples are concise and presented cleanly, and you make nice use of HTML elements (list tags, code tags, etc.). I would also say that the content sounds a little bit like an advertisement for Mozilla. Understandable, but it seems like a good 20% of the text is spent extolling the virtues of Mozilla, Firefox, or both. There is also a non-trivial amount of text about the your MPT and JS itself (that doesn't relate to the theme of the post) -- content that is not bad, _per se_, but also which I don't believe falls in line with the title of the article; it seems more like a stream-of-consciousnesses piece that just so happens to also touch on the new API. The only question that I have after reading the piece, is how does this new API jive with the ECMA standards body? Is this a standard in RFC status, or is it even being considered for such? At this point, I really could care less about the mundane details but more about the potential for widespread use by way of adoption by standards bodies (and eventually, other browsers). That's great you made something cool, but you'd be hard-pressed to find me using any vendor-specific language extensions; I've learned my lesson there...
It looks like these are real, un-nerfed internet sockets, which would make it possible for an extension or app to communicate with servers on any port. You could have a browser-based email client, IRC client, FTP client… anything! WebSockets require WebSocket support at the other end — they can’t be used for other kinds of connections.
A lil expansion: The script type was meant for unimplemented features that have fallen off the road-map. Your browser will always know to make the MIME type text and sub-type javascript. However: there are many templating libraries and such things that make use of the script type by setting it to something like "text/template" the browser doesn't know what to do with template subtype and will not parse that. Leaving you with text that you can extract later and use in your site.
That is a really cool concept, as it would allow Chrome to emulate desktop apps much closer. I'm guessing FFox already has this capability, though? I know they have extensions for IRC, FTP, SSH...
Now add in buffer overflow emulation and you're all set.
My mistake on the console.log line. I just updated the gist
Rotated 90deg clockwise, pixels filled in from top to bottom, and % lines at 10, 25, 50, 75, and 90 for percent of a day would be nice.
would it not pose a serious security problem? What if a land on a site that makes my browser open sockets to all kinds of malicious stuff
Not if it was limited to the extension; typically, a site can't call into an extension, and so it would be virtually impossible for a site to use this functionality unless the extension author specifically wanted to allow it -- and even then, I'm not sure if that would be possible.
Haven't done anything like this before, but it sounds like after they click your button, and move the cursor, it's still inside the &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tags because there aren't any characters after &lt;/b&gt;. Maybe if you put an extra space at the end of your string "&lt;b&gt;"+selected+"&lt;/b&gt; " that will do the trick. If it does work, I would advise checking to see if the last character of selected is a space, and deleting that character if it is, so you don't end up with duplicate spaces.
One thing to note: If no corresponding info element exists (say you have a link with "#foo" but no element with the id "foo") then your script will throw an error. This could possibly interfere with other plugins, fragment identifiers, etc etc. I would say your plugin should either skip attaching an event listener to such "single" elements, or the event listener should check for the helper and if it doesn't exist just return out without doing anything. To fix it, you can can check for the existence of helpfulElement at the same time you are validating ref: // note the use of the comma operator if ( ref &amp;&amp; (ref.charAt(0) === '#') &amp;&amp; (helpfulElement = $(ref), helpfulElement.length) ) { } Or simply add another if after you assign to helpfulElement (or inside the click event handler): if ( ref &amp;&amp; ref.charAt( 0 ) === '#' ) { helpfulElement = $( ref ); if ( helpfulElement.length ) { // blah blah... } } Another thing I would suggest is, if you are writing a jQuery plugin, try following the [jQuery Core Style Guidelines](http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_Core_Style_Guidelines). Also, I realize this is probably just an experiment...but imho you need to work on naming things. "lilHellper" and "helperElement" are not great names and don't describe at all what they do. Additionally, I'm not a huge fan of how this plugin works. It strikes me as somewhat hacky, having some completely unrelated (in terms of DOM structure) element be the container for the info. I'd probably store the description/info as data attached to the link element, or have them directly related in the Document structure. In addition to being cleaner it may allow you to eliminate the closure you are using to store the "helpful element", which on pages with a lot of links could save memory. Other than that though it seems like you've got a pretty good handle on things.
I don't get it. Why is 10 lines to an hour better than 12 lines to an hour? I imagine 300x288 was chosen because it's squarer.
Fair objection. Actually my first reaction was, "Has this person no experience in screen resolutions? Who ever heard of 300x288!!!one" I guess if the seconds of the day more neatly could be represented in 320x200 that would have been my vote. But yeah, 360x240 is just (way) more neat and CS to me. :)
thanks.
the node interpreter say that Math.min() = Ifinity and Math.max()=-Infinity so i guess it just sees that one is a negative number and the other is positive (typeof Infinity = 'number')
Websockets are really mature and work really well. I have no desire to investigate a Chrome only solution to a problem that is already solved.
This might actually make bitcoins practical. However, I'm not sure if I trust javascript to come up with a random key (I assume it has to do this to make a new transaction) without a crypto API.
I'd like to see an in-browser SSH client or something goofy.
shorter/faster implementation: function sprintf(msg) { var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments,1), arg; return msg.replace(/(%[disv])/g, function(a,val) { arg = args.shift(); if (arg !== undefined) { switch(val.charCodeAt(1)){ case 100: return +arg; // d case 105: return Math.round(+arg); // i case 115: return String(arg); // s case 118: return arg; // v } } return val; }); } Essentially, .replace() does 90% of the work already. The choice of using the unicode value of the flag character may seem weird, but Firefox optimizes the crap out of integer-based switch statements, helping to make this version 3x faster than the original. Personally, I think the "return val" line should be a "throw new Error('Don\'t do that!')". Alternatively, something that generates a random value, to get that old comfy C feel back. 
Also, you can get polyfills for a lot of the features. https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-browser-Polyfills (Scoll down to "EMCAScript 5")
It's 300 pixels wide. So each line is 5 minutes (300 seconds). 12 lines make an hour. 
Why did I just sit there watching it for, like, 2 minutes just watching to see it go to the next line?
I'd suggest reading the link more carefully. This is an experimental feature for **Chrome Extensions**. It also surpasses the capability of websockets in some respects. This is useful because it brings Chrome closer to FireFox in terms of extension capability. We'll probably see some interesting new Chrome extensions as a result of this.
WebSockets are not real sockets. They have two very significant restrictions: 1. The same-origin policy applies, just like with other scripting. If you're executing on domain `example.com`, you can only make WebSocket calls to servers on that same domain. 2. The [WebSockets protocol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol-17) does not allow arbitrary net communication; instead, the other end must be specifically listening for the WebSockets protocol handshake, which is designed to be HTTP-compatible. You can only connect to sites that are set up to receive WebSockets connections, you can't use this to implement exiting protocols (such as ssh.) Moreover, the idea that they are mature is laughable. The date on the IETF draft is Sep 2011, and the date on the [w3 draft](http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/) is Dec 2011. And browser support is still [spotty](http://caniuse.com/#feat=websockets) -- about 38% of visitors will have full support, but 52% will have no support whatsoever. Those stats are even a little optimistic, as [WebSockets are disabled by default in Firefox 4 and 5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/WebSockets), so realistically you're only talking about Firefox &gt;= 6 users being able to use this. [According to those same stats](http://caniuse.com/usage_table.php), about 33% of Firefox users are using a version that's &lt; 6. 
Updated the gist. This is perfect, thanks. Sometimes, Mustache or JsRender is overkill when you're just going for quick and dirty. On the other hand, I think the code is a little more self-documenting, when using strings for the comparison (instead of the charCode).
Out of curiosity, what do you gain by making that a jQuery plugin?
Absolutely possible, as long as extensions and site code can manipulate the same DOM. (Although it may well be horribly hacky.)
Thanks for the comments and the pointer to the style guidelines. I'll study them. Sorry you're not a fan of some of my choices :)
Great! I was wondering about such things. Thanks!
that is actually great, technically and aesthetically as well.
I hate to say it, but while I love the technical side of the effect, it ultimately is a gimmick and I find it to be doing a disservice to the art and story. It distracts rather than enhances. Still, it's brilliant as an experiment.
I think it's just a little overused, and the responsiveness needs a tiny bit of finessing.
Your code is nested too far for me to easily wrap my mind around it. Please consider using less anonymous and more named functions if you want people to help with your code.
Wow, that's really depressing to watch.
Even just using more variables and consistent formatting can make things easier to read. *snip* This part is really weird: index = index + 1 &lt; $cars.length ? index + 1 : 0; if (index + 1 === $cars.length) { Edit, sorry I see that you already noticed this. What if you do this instead?
Am I wrong or are %d and %i the same and that they both take the floor of the number passed in (not rounding).
 var $cars = $('.car'); var $remainingCars = $cars; var $info = $('ul.slides div.info'); var $slideItems = $('.slides li'); var $bottomLockup = $('.bottomLockup'); function loop() { var $currentCar = $remainingCars.eq(0); $remainingCars = $remainingCars.not($currentCar); $currentCar.css({ width: '50%', top: '8em', 'padding-left': '12.5em' }); $currentCar.animate({ opacity : 1, top : 0, 'padding-left' : 0, width : '100%' }, 100 /* speed of animate in */, function () { $currentCar.animate({ opacity: 0 }, 100 /*speed of animate out */, function () { if (!$remainingCars.length) { $info.css({ right : '23em' }); $cars.css({ width: '50%', top:'8em', 'padding-left': '12.5em' }); $slideItems.css({ display : 'none', position : 'relative' }); $cars.animate({ top : '0', 'padding-left' : '0', width : '100%', opacity: 1 }, 600, function() { // no duration on this animation? $bottomLockup.animate({ 'opacity' : '1' }); // Info slides in $info.css('opacity', '1'); // no duration on this animation? $info.animate({ right : '0' }); }); slideShow(); } else { loop(); } }); }); } loop(); Still not perfect code, but it expresses better what you mean to say in your code.
I think it could be improved with auto scrolling.
Thanks... I've seen a tonne of libraries now and this one seems like the best.
that error means that a string isn't closed by a matching quote mark. it looks like your string in append() is split on multiple lines. strings i javascript cannot span multiple lines, so to javascript, that looks like the string doesn't have an end.
[Underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/) provides many of these new prototype functions with utilization of the built-in methods if present. Good times.
I hope this means TorButton will come to Chrome.
No support for *listen*?
Right now it renders based only on elevation and temperature, which isn't really accurate. I plan on adding rainfall to generate actual biomes. 
Well, to keep you busy for now... http://code.google.com/p/shellinabox/
Hoping there's about 2,000,000,000 pixels left in my life.
Neat project. Good luck!
 +3.00001 !== Math.round(+3.00001) Math.round may be an unexpected choice, but I was going for a season-to-taste recipe.
There is a new line character in your pasted code in front of that "');" part.
You have a bug. If you add a force to the right and then a force to the left and then repeat this for 30 seconds or so, then all the particles start spazzing out and then disappear.
Interesting feedback. What can I say, I am an enthusiast who likes contextualizing :) Note that this really is the first time people outside of my team hear about OS.File, so this post is just as well about convincing people that the API is useful and well-designed for their needs, informing them about the issues with previous APIs, and getting them to tell me whether they think that they could use it. Definitely more than "announcing", but I think that "introducing" is about the right term. To answer your question, no, there is no RFC, no consideration of RFC at the moment, or anything such. This is a platform library, just as our C++ platform libraries. It happens to be in/for JavaScript, but as it is designed for people developing Mozilla Platform applications or add-ons, rather than for people developing Web Applications, I really cannot think of any reason to attempt to submit it for standardization. For one thing, there is no way it would pass any security scrutiny, as this library is designed for privileged JavaScript. On the other hand, it may be interesting to publish some minor-yet-critical bits as an independent library, for general use by web developers.
Watched the whole thing. I am very new to jquery and this was well explained to me. Is there any other videos like this that gives more examples that anyone would recommend?
Pretty cool, why not use web workers to negate the interface blocking.
yay, i love world generators! but why use midpoint displacement instead of simplex noise? also, i don't get why erosion cuts paths (canyons). not long ago there was a submission here; erosion via rain (in 3d/webgl). ah, [here it is (codeflow)](http://codeflow.org/entries/2011/nov/10/webgl-gpu-landscaping-and-erosion/)! any plans for vegetation and civilisation?
Initially the point of the plugin was to provide a definition of a word, which is what the ABBR tag is designed to do. However the plugin has since changed its purpose as pointed out but the OP.
This? http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/jquery.easing.1.3.js
I plan to but right now I just want to get everything in place before I start thinking about optimizations. 
I haven't started calculating rain yet. When I do I will use that to influence erosion. Once I get the basics to generate biome data (have everything but rain) then I can start generating the proper flora and fauna for a given location. After that I plan to place some civs and generate a history for them.
Oh and I decided on midpoint displacement mainly because that is what is used in dwarf fortress and I just like the algorithm.
This is not my work. You can leave comments on the author's blog: http://mchouza.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/gpgpu-with-webgl-simulating-fluids-trailer/
i once implemented [the same thing](http://procedural.tapirpirates.net/), but i think the next time i'll use simplex. the reason: no need for n^2+1 sizes and you don't need to generate the whole map at once (tiling; minecrafts chunks)
Yeah the odd sizes do limit things a bit.
i'd be interested how you would go about placing towns/settlements. in reality this depends on several things that are hard to quantify (at least without a lot of metadata): * availability of food (fertile land/fishing) * infrastructure (oceans/rivers/roads) * distances to other towns (competition, ...) * racial preferences (elves want wood, dwarves need mountains, humans prefer plains) oh, and i found the [thread about map generation with perlin noise](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ar0qq/javascript_procedural_content_generator/). imho doesn't look as nice as midpoint displacement, but i guess this could be improved with different octaves.
I haven't given too much thought to civ placement yet. Once I get some decent biome data established that will give a better picture about what would and wouldn't be habitable land. Distance to a decent water source should be easy enough to figure out. I also plan to generate a history so that would mean letting the civs coexist with each other for awhile and I would expect them to kill off some of the weaker competition along the way. I agree with you, that perlin noise example looks too much like noise and not as real as what midpoint generates. One advantage I have with the midpoint algorithm is that I make sure no terrain touches the edges of the world by seeding them with 0 elevation. I'm not sure how I would do that using perlin. 
I don't understand the reason why you'd want that. Containers take on the size of the thing they contain, so you shouldn't have to manually adjust anything. If yours isn't, then you might be doing something wrong. In either case, I think we'll need to see a standalone testcase to answer this. Can you post a jsfiddle? 
Cool, thanks for the response. I see what you mean by it being a for the Mozilla Platform, I guess I'm so web-centric that I forget that there are other uses for JS outside of the browser ;) Anyways, hope none of what I wrote was offensive; when someone asks for feedback, that always triggers a brain-dump from me (for better or worse).
The submitted link appears to contain absolutely 0 value from a javascript perspective; it's simply a landing page for a paid service of some sort, which divulges practically no technical details and merely serves to offer up sales blurbs for the service.

&gt; strings i javascript cannot span multiple lines Sure they can, you got wrong info from somewhere: var s = 'this\ is\ a\ multiline\ string\ in\ javascript';
I think in the shorter term it'd make more sense to convert to webGL. Then the computation / rendering would be fast enough for the interface blocking to not be an issue; while avoiding Web Workers until they're better supported. 
Just by loading up the Chrome development panel, I can see you have a javascript syntax error preventing the rest of the script from running: var items = {"type":"image/jpeg","width":1040,"height":678,"id":12864815,"url":"http://m.cmcdn.net/12864815/940x613.jpeg"}, "description":"&lt;p&gt;Ink Magazine Summer 2011 Editorial&lt;/p&gt;","thumbnail":{"type":"image/jpeg","width":1040,"height":678,"id":12864815}} At the end of the first line, you've closed your object with the } curly brace, thus producing the "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected string" error.
you have an extra curly bracket hanging around. Look at line 117 &gt;var items = {"type":"image/jpeg","width":1040,"height":678,"id":12864815,"url":"http://m.cmcdn.net/12864815/940x613.jpeg"}, delete that last curly bracket
are you kidding? He's obviously trying to learn, basic javascript isn't over *anybody's* head, *especially* if he's here trying to learn. 
That's 965 Full HD (1920x1080) widescreen monitors. 
Where did you get that flipbook script from? Your JSON is indeed messed up and it would help to see what is expected vs what is being given. As a small point, if I ever download a script, even without a license, I will put the URL in a comment in the script after minifying/compressing just so I can look at the site later if need be.
I don't see why you couldn't estimate the probability of a particular location being a town or settlement using multivariate interpolation. I've had success using a Gaussian radial basis function for color estimation using scattered data. The same thing could be done for estimating population density. 
Check out /r/worldbuilding. You might enjoy it too.
Thanks for cleaning it up, do you think it's easier if I just add a class "last-class" to the last list item and check if that's true? EDIT: Just kidding, I realized you fixed it for me -__-'' thanks for all your help!
 if (!$remainingCars.length) { I usually use this idiom to check if a selector is empty (has no elements in it), or the opposite to check if it has at least 1 item.
degreasing. 
Actually, do you know how I could skip over the first one?
You could change the second line to something like this: var $remainingCars = $cars.slice(1); // removes the first item 
You have saved my life. If I could give you a boat of upvotes, I would Noah that all over you. Thanks so much!
Nothing at all, most of it don't even make use of jQuery. It was simply part of a larger bundle of jQuery plugins called jQuery Utils that I used to maintain. Today the project is pretty much dead, but this still use this particular plugin in my everyday projects quite often. At one point I wanted to drop the jQuery requirement, but I never had the time to actually do it. And since I always use jQuery I lacked the incentive to take the time to do it I guess. 
ok, yes, escaping newlines, you can have a string span multiple lines
The hooks they have set up are great, if you want to get ultra-fancy too.
My own personal recipe: * [jQuery](http://jquery.com) (31KB) - easier DOM manipulation, Event framework, ajax, etc. * [jQuery HashChange](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/) (.8KB) - cross browser event handler for hashchange * [requireJS](http://requirejs.org/docs/download.html) (12.8KB) - dynamically load JS as needed * [My MVC](https://github.com/jamon/SOFEA/blob/master/htdocs/js/ydmf/Mvc.js) (1.5KB) - minimalist MVC framework * [Google Closure Templates](http://code.google.com/closure/templates/) (5KB) - robust templating (compiled, very fast; XSS protection, etc) Total of 51KB. I'm working on reducing that by rewriting requireJS to handle optional dependencies and to be simpler/smaller ([includejs](https://github.com/jamon/includejs)). I'm also working to make Closure Templates more approachable and adding better support for different script loaders by writing a compiler for them in Javascript ([soyjs-compile](https://github.com/jamon/soyjs-compile)) Add in whichever UI widget framework you like. The core feature of my "Framework" is that it leaves you in control, rather than trying to build a box around you that presumes to know what you'll want to do. You can see a very simplistic example at [sofea.net](http://sofea.net). It's not compiled/minified but it supports being built down into fewer files for faster load times (not that it isn't lightning fast already). Your first page load when the site is compiled/minified is about 5-6 HTTP requests and about 60KB and renders in under 200ms. Each additional page load starts at around 500 Bytes, and typically renders in less than 50ms.
Don't want to pollute the above post, but here's an example Controller: https://github.com/jamon/SOFEA/blob/master/htdocs/js/sofea/controller/index.js and an example template: https://github.com/jamon/SOFEA/blob/master/soy/sofea/view/index.soy Layouts are interesting, because they can be chained. Each controller that uses a layout is knowledgeable about the layout it belongs to. If the user browses between pages (controllers) that participate in the same layout, no additional rendering needs to be done of the layout.. no reloading it, no redrawing it, etc. That layout can participate in another layout, or can have other re-usable components on it.
Click the buttons at the top, it scrolls to the correct position. If it entirely scrolls automatically - some people will find it stay too long on a section, while others will think it moves too fast...
I'm a high school kid. It's a project for web class. -.- I don't want anyone to do my homework for me.
Well, that's good, but....you're basically asking us to do your work for you here. And when you open with _"So basically I have no idea what I'm doing"_, that's not something a student should be saying...
I just tried all those, it remained blank.
Still not showing anything. There is still something I am not getting fully.
I copy and pasted it into the document I was using, but it doesn't seem like it should need to be a new document.
Thanks for the tips! 
I actually tried that, it seems to be saved as a a text file ".txt". When I run it, it just prints the code on the page, no circle.
I've got it! Thank you for your help. I'm not actually sure what happened there, but I may have been editing and saving into **one** file and then trying to run **another** file. There was a duplicate I believe also. Trying to figure all this out I've been making new files and saving files and writing code. Hard to keep track of all at first. I'm sure to smooth out my process with time.
try setting the fill color!
I wanted help with figuring out what was wrong with the javascript. Javascript is not part of our curriculum. If I stuck to our curriculum I'd be making a Tumblr background or a blog, which is something I accomplished in the first week of my class. I try in my class, but when not even the teacher, who I *did* ask before posting, cannot figure out what is wrong, then I turn to the internet.
Thank you. I'll have to find that development panel.
..why would you be a student if you already knew what you were doing?
Thank you for the tips. I'm just now learning this type of thing, and it is very interesting.
I already did this, and I have cross-browser compatibility: http://grantgalitz.org/wav_player/ I decode the entire audio binary in JavaScript (Unlike the "look here, we used HTML5 &lt;audio&gt; and make a quick Web Audio API script."), then keep it in a typed array or regular array (fallback support). I wrote a separate library for proper raw PCM output from javascript: https://github.com/grantgalitz/XAudioJS It decodes AIFF and WAV files that contain 1 to 64-bit signed integer data, 1 to 8 bit unsigned data, IEEE float 32 data, IEEE float 64 data, u-law encoded data, and a-law encoded data. You play your own files via the file api, hence the load input. You can also try it with a preloaded version at - http://grantgalitz.org/sound_test/
&gt;Since we rely on the browser for laying out the text in the container, we have no way of knowing where in the text the desired height is reached, or even where line breaks are occurring. So we ended up truncating based on character count after all. It’s not great, but it’s a decent proxy for element height. Fail. If you're going to do that you might as well be doing it on the server, and avoid doing unnecessary work in the browser. The thing is: jQuery *is* able to find out what the pixelheight of the text in a styled div is. (And if it didn't, it could be implemented using [getComputedStyle()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.getComputedStyle), which, at the very least, *is* being used in jQuery.) So they should have trimmed the text down to where it vertically fits.
Right, my code above demonstrates why Math.min() === Infinity, and Math.max() === -Infinity. **EDIT:** In case you were unaware, "Infinity" is a [global variable in JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Infinity)
protip: use [version control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control) (preferably [git](http://git-scm.com/)). that allows you to track changes in your code and go back to where everything worked in order to figure out what changes broke the thing.
1. Students take classes every day that they already know the material for; it's all in the sake of getting that piece of paper... 2. Students are rarely assigned work without first being instructed over such work (at least for undergrads); in the least, the student should never say _'have no idea what I'm doing'_, and if so, then they probably haven't been paying attention or they were just plain skipping class.
&gt; and if so, then they probably haven't been paying attention or they were just plain skipping class Or they're attempting to teach themselves things by [going further than the course materials](http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/n3zh4/accidental_murder_of_a_website_help/c36793y). Going above and beyond and taking charge of their own education, instead of sitting like passive, receptive bovines waiting to be spoon-fed learnin's. You know - things that are generally agreed to be *a good thing*.
He hasn't demonstrated that he's even attempted to learn any real programming, much less JS, and by his own admission, just grabbed the code off the web, tried to change it, broke it, and is now seeking help here. Typically, when someone asks for programming help, they demonstrate at least a modicum of knowledge about the problem domain, e.g. _'the console says that foo is undefined`_ or similar. This question would likely be downvoted to hell on SO and you know it, because it's a very poor question. "I copy/pasted some code, then I tried to change it, now it's broke, HELP!" Even looking at the responses in this thread, I still don't see _any_ indication that they're even attempting to learn JS -- rather, it looks more like they just want to get this fancy whizz-bang feature in for extra credit. Whatever, I'm not wasting any more of my time here.
Novel, excellently-implemented and really original. Sadly the style of presentation completely distracts from the story, to the point you really can't appreciate both at once. You can only read the text when the scrolling stops, but you can only appreciate the parallax effect when the page is moving, and you have to keep jumping between the text and picture to make sure you don't scroll too far and skip chunks of text. It's like beautifully cooked steak with a beautifully-made frosting of icing on top. Both parts are stimulating and excellently executed, but put together each just ruins the other.
That doesn't seem like very much. Best get crackin' if I'm going to take over the world.
&gt; reads the contents of the file as a string (assuming ASCII encoding); **runs screaming into the night**
Press F12 in Chrome. You can debug javascript in the "Scripts" panel. Errors will show in the bottom right as a red icon (if any exist). 
How do you want to add nodes to the collection? What do you want this custom collection to do that native lists cannot?
I don't know javascript or jQuery very well either but this seems like it should be a pretty simple thing. You'll need to do a couple of things: 1. attach to the scroll action. should be standard jQuery stuff 2. in the function you want to alternate between 2 states (or however many graphics you have). a simple if...then...else should do the trick. just use a variable to store the state, check the variable, and switch to the other state. 3... 4. profit Throw out some code and I'm sure the uber-geeks of reddit will help you get it working.
 function Node ( val, parent ) { this.parent = parent; this.value = val; this.children = []; } Node.prototype = { addChild: function ( val ) { this.children.push( new Node( val, this ) ); } }; var a = new Node( "a" ); a.addChild("x"); a.addChild("y"); a.addChild("z"); // the node console.log( a ); var kids = a.children; // check parent console.log( kids[0].parent === a ); // true
Yes this was similar to my earlier solutions, but I was looking for a way to accomplish this without having to explicitly specify pass a reference to the parent ( or collection ). While in this particular case, I realize I shouldn't be to concerned with that, I could see it being useful elsewhere.
Well nothing in particular at this point, heh. As I mentioned, this was just something I've been messing around with exploring the whole prototype system. So while there really is no good reason for making a collection object as I have done, I still would like to know how I could pass a reference like I've been trying. Furthermore I could see being able to do this as beng quite valuable in future projects so I thought I might try and figure it out.
The Paul Irish video was from months ago.
I'm curious what the situation you are seeing is, where you have a reference to a parent and need to add a child to that parent without being able to pass the reference of the parent into the child node. 
When you change the prototype of an object, you change every instance of that object that has been or ever will be created. You can't change the prototype of a single instance - just not possible in JavaScript. Think of changing a prototype of an object as something akin to modifying a class in more classical OO language like Java. Example: var Collection = function() { this.nodes = [] }; var collectionOne = new Collection(); Collection.prototype.myId = 42; var collectionTwo = new Collection(); collectionOne.myId === collectionTwo.myId; // true So you can't really modify an object's prototype if you want to do something with that specific instance. It'd probably be easier to answer (for me at least ;) if you explained *why* you don't want to pass in a reference to the collection a node is part of.
No particularly compelling reason to be honest. On one hand I was just exploring ways in which I could use prototypes. On the other hand I felt that automatically passing the reference would be far cleaner and nicer than having to pass it explicitly. Also I didn't want to deal with sorting through optional arguments, which all arguments to the nodes would be, including an argument specifying a collection. So yeah, no real good reason. Just trying stuff out. : ) Edit: Also, noting that the second snippet of code in the post doesn't work, I'm curious as to what is happening. I see no errors being thrown running that code, but the resultant nodes don't have that prototype. 
Well its not that I have seen a case where I haven't simply been able to pass a reference to the parent to the child, but I was wondering if there was a way I could accomplish the same thing without having to do so. heh. I've had many situations in which I've had to pass a reference to the parent to the child, and I was just looking for a better way to do it.
Aw man, learning for the sake of learning - the best reason to do anything! [I added some comments to your code on this fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/K8uu3/) - hope it answers your question about what's happening. If you're just playing around with different ways of having variables, check out [this fiddle which uses closures](http://jsfiddle.net/L3XtN/2/) to add a reference to a node's parent kinda automatically maybe.
Yeah but I found it this week, and thought it was interesting enough to share.
Yup, that looks like a good start depending on what your server variable is going to return. You need to be careful and might want to turn that into a string like so: &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; var GenericVariable = "&lt;%Request.ServerVariables(somevarhere) %&gt;"; &lt;/script&gt; In javascript it's null not Null, so it would throw an error. If it's a string then you can do whatever check you need and you know it's not going to throw an error because asp wants to return some weird type.
If you use this you just have to make sure to double check the whitespace around the string. Whitespace after a \ will cause an error. Whitespace at the beginning of a line may or may not be included in the resulting string depending on what browser it is and what type of whitespace it is (tab or space). This isn't part of ECMAscript so different browsers can handle this a bit differently. var s = 'this' + ' is' + ' a' + ' multiline' + ' string' + ' in' + ' javascript'; It eliminates that variability and is the way I always prefer to do it since I am not a fan of opening my code up to glitches that can be caused by whitespace like that. 
I decided to try it out. y=0; function scrollSome(){window.scrollTo(++y,0)} function startScroll(){continueScroll=scrollThread;continueScroll();} function stopScroll(){continueScroll=null;} function scrollThread(){setTimeout(continueScroll,50);scrollSome();} startScroll();
Yeah, but 1 more and you can just write in [ ](white space)
In rails/backbone i use to_json.html_safe: &lt;script&gt; window.App = new Application; App.start('http://' + &lt;%= request.host.to_json.html_safe %&gt;); &lt;/script&gt; #=&gt; localhost I'd see if there was an asp alternative.
You should never mix code like this. Code/scripts executed separately should only communicate via common means. If you're on the client side and needs to asked the server about something you do it with an XMLHttpRequest (ajax). This is one good reason for putting your code in separate documents. This server variable you are passing to the client is already set at the time of sending it so it seems you should do the redirection on the server side.
This is probably semantically true, but in reality I have never found semantics to be 100% aplicable. What this then forces is two requests for information that can be gathered in the first request. You have now forced the server to deal with two requests in the queue when it could have been done in one request. I see nothing wrong with "constructing" a page, including some JavaScript variables, on the server side and responding with that constructed code. Nobody has an issue with dynamically created HTML, we probably shouldn't frown on server-side dynamically created JavaScript either. EDIT: I guess one way to do this could be to create a totally dynamic JavaScript document, rendered from ASP that is constructed when requested that has these variables in it. It is then included on the HTML page: &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="my_dynamic_ASP_javascript.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; This page then has those necessary server variables. Yes, I know, this is another request to the server...
I have used [dygraphs](http://dygraphs.com/). Simple to use. Nice demo similar to highcharts is [here](http://dygraphs.com/tests/dynamic-update.html)
Is the remote debugging not some massive flaw in security?
Do you mean something like this? Collection = function() { this.nodes = []; this.Node = function( collection ){ return function( value ) { this.collection = collection; this.links = []; this.value = value; collection.nodes.push(this); }; }(this); } var a = new Collection(); var n = new a.Node("test"); console.dir( n ); Oops! I had a stupid mistake in there that I just fixed.
I'm excited to see this, I'm actually fairly new to JS frameworks. I wonder if bits from this can be mixed with bits from KendoUI?
Thank god I chose to never use Sproutcore.
Very useful for testing. Not intended as a real feature, though.
No problem and thanks for the feedback :)
Yeah, that's the problem I have with some of the frameworks/libs (esp. the lesser-used ones); it's trivial for the devs to just drop all development or otherwise change the project so that it's no longer inline with your reasons for choosing them in the first place... And reading more, I don't see that they speak to the future of SproutCore 1.x _at all_, leaving me to draw the conclusion that it will be dropped wholesale by the original team (while this new incarnation will be foisted in its place).
Is this guy for real or just trolling? He seems to be just contradicting best practices for lulz. I'm surprised he wasn't advocating leaving out semi-colons and depend on the engine to place them for you.
I totally second that. That's exactly the reason why flash peeps gets mad. It's not a matter of domination, it's just that seeing people asking to use 10 years old technologies (remember DHTML? that's what most the non tech people call HTML5) to do something flash do well for years. You guys were talking about sound, and it's the same about video: it's technically extremely complicated to achieve and even though you manage to do it: then the battle about business of codecs will begin. Good luck with that. It's just history repeating itself, same thing happened with flash.
"it still holds the edge in multimedia on the web", so you're acknowledging the fact that flash is a superior technology then? Therefore, why asking for an inferior technology to replace it?
Oh wow thats rad. I finally get why you might want to return a closure like that.
I think one of the main reasons for the name change was so that the SC 1.x line of development can continue unimpeded by their decision to head a different direction. From what I've seen on the IRC channel, I think that development will continue on the 1.x branch, albeit by a different core crew.
While it's good that the original namespace won't be trampled, I wouldn't place a dime on the future of the 1.x. No offense to whoever may pick it up, but when you lose the core devs that provided the vision that drove the project in the first place, you're replacing much more than a code monkey. You just can't swap out project leads like you can a cog in a machine...
Rather disappointed with the name. There is already on JS project with an active community called Amber: [Amber Smalltalk](http://amber-lang.net/). Amber is an in the bowser Smalltalk IDE that compiles and interopts with JS. If the author of Amber.js had done even a cursory search for other JS projects called Amber, he would have found it.
pretty cool. If you are the author you might be interested in https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/ (or something like it) Might clean up your js a bit wrt to html generation.
That looks pretty slick, can you send me something you've made with it to check out?
Plus a ~4kb library, and JS dependency?
Let me ellaborate, what I meant why add a JavaScript dependency for this? You could easily do this with a plain CSS file instead, it's just basic styling, right?
I am not. All I am saying is that if one technology is superior to another then the market will make the determination on what should be dominate in the marketplace. That determination will stand regardless of attempts by single parties, such as the late Steve Jobs, attempting to influence opinion in a particular direction.
The thing is there is no need for two requests. If all data for generating the appropriate response is already on the server then it is the servers task to do so. There's no dynamic content (on the client side), therefore no need for Javascript. Unobtrusive javascript is a good motto.
typeof OscarGodson === 'clown'; // true
Might want to look in the examples folder if thats what you're after. https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/tree/master/examples
This is like when Nan takes her dentures out and eats her Coumadin mashed up in pineapple and room-temperature dry cottage cheese and you can hear her mouth making viscous sounds down the hall... in terms of what I want from a computer in 2012. These games are cool as hell. I have no issue with this project here, but is this really where we are? My 286 did fullscreen, nevermind the ⅛" pixels.
It just helps you organize your JS better if you are building a lot of HTML with it (which Game.js definitely is). Mustache lets you can keep all your markup in a template and reference the data you need from your script within; makes it easier to maintain. Mustache should probably be considered for any project where there is lots of HTML generation and DOM manipulation in the JS.
This is something I made because someone complained about GMail's new icons. I tested the code with XKCD, where it works very well. I've always had trouble reading the alt text in Windows because it hides itself too fast. Now I can control it with a button press. Add the code in a bookmark in your browser. Prepend it with the word "javascript:" (include colon). Add it to your bookmark bar if you use one.
About multi-line string with "\" ... &gt; You should be aware though that Google and "X-Core" JavaScript elitist will give you shit for this because while this works, it's actually not part of EMCAScript and JavaScript engines just happen to all support it. It's actually part of ECMAScript 5 and not all browser support ECMAScript 5 so it's consider safe (for browser code) to not use it for this reason.
I'd prefer something FOSS and that has zoom.
*pukes*
I agree with this. It sounds like the desired functionality is supposed to occur on page load, so in that case, the server should do the work up front without the use of any javascript. If the variable is null on the server when loading the page, have the server do the redirect. If the variable is not null, then modify the markup the server generates to have a grayed out page with a reload button. If this variable were to be used in javascript after specific UI interactions, then I would be more inclined to store the value in a DOM element, such as a hidden field (or maybe as a "data-" attribute on the body tag or something - depends on what the purpose of this variable is and where it would be relevant to place it. Since this thing has a role of graying out an entire page, maybe the body element would make sense), and retrieve the value via javascript. &gt; Nobody has an issue with dynamically created HTML, we probably shouldn't frown on server-side dynamically created JavaScript either. The reason why I would personally avoid dynamic javascript is because it's nice to be able to have static scripts that are cacheable on the client. Dynamic markup is unavoidable.
I don't really understand what this is. It is sponsored by Toyota and apparently done by Microsoft. Yet the game is really bad. I don't mean to offend, it almost seems like the game is supposed to be bad? Can anyone explain a bit for someone totally out of the loop? Edit: -1 for asking a legitimate question. Great Subreddit...
Sharing buttons are an abomination.
Yehuda spoke to this on the HN thread about this. SC 1.x is going to continue to be developed by the SC team with a focus on mobile. Amber.js is more of a generic web app framework. It's more of a fork than an upgrade-and-shank.
Wonder if it can be used with jquery mobile ... ?
 var a = 'b' , foo = 'bar' , lorem = 'ipsum' , hello = 42 Come on!! 
You're using JSONP, and this is a known limitation of that. The way JSONP works is that you actually create a &lt;script&gt; tag with a src attribute that points to your cross-domain target, that URL also contains a (on your end) defined callback function, so you effectively know when you have received a response because the server will wrap the "normal" JSON with a Padding, namely, your defined callback function. So, if your JSON would normally be: { "status": true } the actual response would be: myCallback({ "status": true }); Anyway, what you need to do is adding a timeout while using $.ajax instead, see here for a more elaborate answer: http://stackoverflow.com/a/5121811 
This is a good example of why I hate the '$' shortcut so many javascript libraries use. There is no way to tell for sure what library getJSON is from. I'll assume it is jQuery. You need to work on your google-fu. A quick search lead me here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/309953/how-do-i-catch-jquery-getjson-or-ajax-with-datatype-set-to-jsonp-error-w You may have hit on a bug in jQuery. (edit: or as yoeschmoe said, more a limitation than a bug)
Perfect, I've included the timeout and things are flowing nicely. I'm surprised this limitation exists, it's surely one of the main things to factor in with a function of this nature. Much appreciated.
Thanks for the headsup, I've gone and followed yoeschmoe's timeout tip. It's a solution of sorts! 
Its all a result of cross site requests and the (in my opinion slightly over the top) security around that. Workarounds to compensate for issues like this are very common and never clean / pretty. I'm glad you were able to find a solution that addressed your problem though ... I'm certain we've all been in a situation where it seems like the language is specifically making it harder for us to do what we want to do. 
What other libraries use $, I have only seen jQuery use it.
There technically is a way to catch 404s on the jsonp request on most browsers. You can see an example of this (jsonp just uses script tags) in my code at https://github.com/jamon/includejs). I'd provide more detail, but I'm browsing on my phone. I'll try to come back later and give a real example.
[Prototype](http://api.prototypejs.org/dom/dollar/) and [MooTools](http://mootools.net/docs/core/Element/Element#Window:dollar), for example. I will admit that, if I do see `$` I will assume that it's using jQuery.
Use jQuery .get() instead which you can handle the http status error code. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
I think Prototype does? It's kind of annoying when people try to mix different libraries like that together so I started writing out jQuery every time.
Ender does as well, although it's pretty much a drop in replacement for jquery at this point.
Do you just proxy requests though the originating server, and not like how clean that is? That's what I'm doing now.
That's not "clean" to me at all, but no; I use the setTimeout kludge. I don't think proxying through the originating server is clean because you're adding bandwidth to the server for no reason other than to bypass security restrictions on the browser. That's not elegant or ideal, and therefore I don't consider it "clean".
For more granular control over jsonp requests, please [use this library](http://code.google.com/p/jquery-jsonp/). It features: * error recovery in case of network failure or ill-formed JSON responses, * precise control over callback naming and how it is transmitted in the URL, * multiple requests with the same callback name running concurrently, * two caching mechanisms (browser-based and page based), * the possibility to manually abort the request just like any other AJAX request, * a timeout mechanism.
You don't need semi colons in your javascript :\
Yeah, I wanted something better, but it seemed like the best option for what I was doing.
[Rickshaw](http://shutterstock.github.com/rickshaw/) is a JavaScript toolkit for creating interactive time series graphs... (their words) Was just released and I think had a reddit link here or in /r/programming in the last day. Looks nice; check out this [demo](http://shutterstock.github.com/rickshaw/examples/extensions.html) Finally, some trivial example code: var graph = new Rickshaw.Graph( { element: document.querySelector('#graph'), series: [ { color: 'steelblue', data: [ { x: 0, y: 23}, { x: 1, y: 15 }, { x: 2, y: 79 } ], }, { color: 'lightblue', data: [ { x: 0, y: 30}, { x: 1, y: 20 }, { x: 2, y: 64 } ], } ] } ); graph.render(); 
you can use xmlhttprequest and then check for the response type in the listener. Here's more info on it: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XMLHttpRequest 
Cool--lots of fun both playing with it and looking at how you did it. Thanks! 
No problem. Glad you enjoyed it!
What best practices am I contradicting?
Whats wrong with that?
Coming from the guy who browses the /r/sex and /r/relationships all day, im fine with you thinking that.
Complex ternary operators. I've never been part of an enterprise team that has allowed these beyond the most simple of cases. Non-standard multi-line strings. Crockford's famous example Nothing wrong with this: var str = "non standard \ multiline \ strings"; Something wrong with this (in fact your own code makes this error which is what makes me suspect even more you're trolling): var str = "non standard \ multiline \ strings"; I don't particularily agree with comma first but that's just preference ,because it just doesn't flow grammatically ,you know?
Wow that is really neat. Love that it works on the iPad as well. Go HTML5!
Fabulous, i love that it reacts adversely to the mouse pos. Centering creates a wonderful heart. 
For example app checkout [http://www.excelmashup.com/ExampleApp](http://www.excelmashup.com/ExampleApp)
Those switch styles are always confusing because you can see both labels at the same time and have ambiguous feedback about the current state. If you're going to do switches, perhaps try something like this: http://www.catchmyfame.com/jquery/lightswitch/d5.html
Thanks, I'll consider integrating that.
Pretty nice :D. Put this on Github so others can fork it and play around with the code. :3
Looks good. Whenever I try to do anything like this for some reason I seem unable to make it not lag to crap. Heck I tried to make a simple bloody mouse pointer game and it didnt get past 20 fps on firefox (Although it was at 170 on Internet Explorer 10 which I thought was amazing).
The big part of why it's not a good idea is that his own code example throws a syntax error exception.
Nice. I made a [submission to JS1K](http://js1k.com/2010-first/demo/266) that uses canvas and colors in a similar way. Very fun do do.
That's really awesome. I've been messing around with rainbow-colored balls for the better part of last week and I've kinda run out of creativity with them. Nice job!
While the experiment was nice, I wasn't half so impressed as with the code itself. Elegant. A++++++ Would view code again!
I thought this article was going to be about Amber Smalltalk. Had me confused.
Setting the `.src` attribute doesn't wait for the iframe to load and render, it returns immediately. I think you're going to have to use interval polling to detect when the frame is finished loading. If it was loading HTML, then you could just check every 200ms or something with a `getElementById()` on some object known to be in the iframe, such that when it succeeds you know it's loaded. But since this a SWF object that probably won't work. I'm a little hazy on how Flash can communicate/interact with the page DOM, but I think there's an API for that. You could have the SWF indicate when it's done loading by setting some attribute on some element of a known ID, such that your JS interval polling code could detect that it's ready and hide the element. (Or maybe the SWF could just change the style of the div to hidden itself when it's ready.) This is all predicated on the iframe being in the same origin, as there's no way to communicate with it otherwise. If the SWF is hosted under a different domain, this won't work. 
you do know that an iframe has an onload event right? if you used jQuery, you could do something like... $('div#myDiv').show(); $('iframe.yourClassName').load(function(){ $('div#myDiv').hide(); });
The idea behind putting your (small) images in your CSS is fewer http-requests and therefore a faster website.
Haha, thanks. I commented it far more than usual for a small personal experiment just so you could all understand it ;)
`var number = window.prompt("What number?");` 
I very much agree with SteveRyherd, and at the very least, you can use other visual cues like contrast to indicate which state it is in. For instance, use that same white over green/red if that side is active, but make the other button light grey text over medium grey background (or medium grey over dark grey). You'd need enough separation to make the text legible, but not so much that it's contrast out-weighs the white over green/red. It's still not totally ideal IMO, but much better than giving both sides the same weight of constrast.
Thank you very much. Now let me see if I can make sense of this syntax: the identifier "var" is standard variable declaration; the identifier "number" is the name you chose for the input; then the assignment operator assigns whatever comes to the window.prompt() method. Finally, the identifier "window.prompt()" also has a standard syntax for selecting an object and one of its properites: object.prop(). Please correct me if I ve misinterpreted anything.
&gt; div#myDiv FYI, the 'div' here is totally pointless. Selectors read right to left, so it's going to find the unique ID first, and then run another check to make sure it's a div. No reason to overqualify like that.
A few thoughts: *. `jqueryCheckboxSwitch` is probably a little verbose as a name. The word jQuery isn't really necessary. It's a method that's always going to be executed on a jQuery object anyway. *. You have a lot of places where you repeatedly call .css() to set multiple styles. You'd be better off just passing in a map of properties and only calling .css() once, e.g. $('#something').css({ 'background-color': '#000', 'color': '#fff' });
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem
prompt() returns a string btw. You will need parseInt() or parseFloat() to convert it to a number if you need to work with it as a number.
TIL
 var a = 'b', foo = 'bar', lorem = 'ipsum', hello = 42; It should be something like this. This is the way that most people doing javascript declare the variables, and unless you are certain that you will be the only one that will touch the code EVER, you should follow this kind of stuff. 
This is impressive, thank you for sharing this!
But then there is no caching on the browsers end which means more bandwidth and slower loading? I think...
I have not been using these "parse..." methods and yet I have coded some functioning programs. I read in the book JavaScript, the Definitive Guide, that type conversion is almost automatic
If you use the inline image approach, yeah, there's not caching. If the image is small enough, like for UI enhancements, the loss of caching is trivial though If you use the CSS approach in an external stylesheet, that can be cached Connection latency can easily be a bigger issue than bandwidth, so reducing the number of connections is important. That's why a lot of sites use the [sprite approach](http://static01.linkedin.com/scds/common/u/img/sprite/sprite_global_v6.png), over individual images wherever they can.
The .css file is cached
Awesome job on this. You deserve recognition for making a simple, elegant tool that serves a real-world need. I really like the idea of using base64 images for those small, repeated icons throughout my sites. I'll definitely be using this code in my web development toolkit.
Just beware that on mobile devices, the cache size is very small so you might be hurting your users experience more. I'd recommend making one image sprite over using data-uri's. Speed wise it'll be about the same, plus caching.
Unless it's a large file and on mobile. http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/06/28/mobile-browser-cache-limits/
The site is written using Mootools and is 100%ish Javascript. Upon login the user is sent a single minified javascript file ~600kb containing all the classes and the main app. All requests/responses are done through xmlhttprequest.
I could see it for something like this a[href$=".pdf"]:after{width:16px;height:16px;inline-display:block;content:url(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAQAMQAAOawsf88P7W1t/4oK/FsbeSPkfh6fNoSFevY2uNdXj8/P+ft8dlRUasCBd08O9NlafBNTry8v/r8/MfHyX9/giUlJYsBA/Pz88HBwevr6/oIC9LS0tvb26ysrOPj4////yH5BAAAAAAALAAAAAAQABAAAAWa4CduQmeenSeuXzRhUVRSXseJBgFBQR8MB4qkdjP8NMhkQzhMEQaDJPJgoVitG6ply916JhNXZIXZTDYcBsfDMXMEZA/6wvBk2BsPXIRhZxAOBRd3eR1xHhcGCwUAgxwZhnwZfxAAADsQgpEfGBcXCQAIFxILAA+QcQmCdx54HJsYBAQXrRxtG2WwEhKTtW1nmxEKFcTFxQoCIQA7);} where it's just a small pdf icon shown after links to a pdf file. 
awesome!
Using document.write has some very bad side effects. The way the browser works is it parses the html markup and creates a dom tree of the page. The dom can then be accessed through javascript and styled with css. But when you use document.write, what happens is that the browser pauses the page rendering when finding a script, and goes through looking for document.writes, if it finds one it outputs it on the page. And then resumes rendering. This means you can't use document.write for anything post dom-construction as it would wipe out the page. This also means you cannot execute your scripts asynchronously or defer their executing till after the page has rendered. Techniques that can make your page load seem faster. In short the browser has to wait for every single document.write before finishing the page rendering. It is a simple looking way to add content. But will most definitely bite you in the ass. The better way to insert stuff into the page is to use, for example, innerHTML. If you're just testing and want to know what's going on in a script, console.log() might be a better option. Anyway, for any of the dom selector apis to actually work reliably you'll have to wait until the dom has been constructed or "loaded". With dom selector apis, I'm talking about stuff like document.getElementById("someid"); So in jQuery they have the $(document).ready() function. Which fixes some browser crap. But basically it sets up a event listener for "DOMContentLoaded" (which fires when the dom has been constructed) but also checks if the dom already loaded. Then there's the onload event, you'll probably see that one hanging on the body tag on a lot of sites. This event fires after every asset has finished loading. So the time from which you can start manipulating the page through scripts and the time onload fires could potentially be several seconds, or longer if the page loads huge images. Anyways, DOMContentLoaded is available in all current versions of browsers. Meaning IE9+ Then there's something like this to support all the crap browsers and quirks: https://github.com/ded/domready/blob/master/ready.js Or use one of the JS Dom libraries like jQuery to add a dom "ready" function. So for modern browsers, do something like this to execute the your javascript after dom has been constructed: function domReady(fn) { if ( document.readyState.match(/loaded|interactive|complete/) ) fn(); else document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() { fn(); }, false); } domReady(function(){ // dom ready var output = document.getElementById("output_box"); output.innerHTML = "Replace the contents of H1"; output.innerHTML += "&lt;br&gt; Append some more stuff"; }); jQuery: $(document).ready(function(){ // dom ready }); 
You have a special place reserved for yourself in hell.
The best part: No code comments!
You better not tell future developers where you live.
I'll probably be homeless soon anyway.. so problem solved.
Wouldn't it make sense to have CSS rules in your CSS, and utilize a 2nd simultaneous connection to download an image file of images? Browsers can do - what - 3 simultaneous connections to a URL? I would think you'd take advantage of that. (And since they're simultaneous and not sequential, connection latency won't increase the total time-to-download.) I'm not seeing a situation in which it makes sense to put images in CSS, but perhaps I'm not being imaginative enough. :)
That uses ajax which won't work as it's limited to the same origin security policy and he's trying to load content from another domain.
The best use case for images in CSS is for mobile sites, but if you have a site with dozens of small images, spriting and inlining are best practice. [http://code.google.com/speed/articles/mobile.html](http://code.google.com/speed/articles/mobile.html) &gt;**Reduce the number of requests and the amount of data transferred** &gt;To avoid a dramatic increase in latency, it is a good idea to reduce the number of times your website or application must make a round-trip request to your server. Single large objects load faster than many small ones due to TCP and socket behavior. Keep in mind that while these are general best practices, they especially apply to mobile. Sprite your images using CSS or transfer your images using a data URI scheme. See the logo image on a Google Search result page for an example of a CSS sprite. Some of Google's services, such as Wave, consolidate static requests by using the data URI scheme, which is a way of including static data items in-line on a web page. The data URI technique will not work on older browsers and should be used for pages and applications specifically designed for iPhone, Android, or other modern mobile web browsers. &gt;Including an image by its base64 string may cause a loss in some compression provided by image formats (data transferred this way must rely solely on gzip for compression). But, you do avoid opening a new connection/HTTP request, which is often a more important savings factor for mobile. Instead of having a CSS file that imports several others, or a JavaScript file that loads other bits of code, consolidate all of your page's dependencies into a single file. Reducing your page down to a single file (and thus a single request) will yield an increase in speed.
One thing that becomes a problem is that is that you're essentially doubling filesize by base 64 encoding.
I did not know you could do this! You my friend just won today's internet! 
Type conversion is automatic, but due to various considerations it may not always behave how you expect/want it to. Things get especially hairy when you're dealing with raw input from the user. In most cases it's best to just be explicit about what you want converted and how. Just another note, if you're doing some *very* basic explorations for yourself...fair enough, but really you **need** to be getting out of the habit of using document.write, window.alert, and window.prompt ASAP. To get information back/print things for debugging, use the console. To display information to the user use some sort of DOM API. To get information from the user use input elements, etc. Sites like [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) are great for quick little experiments. 
&gt; Reducing your page down to a single file (and thus a single request) will yield an increase in speed. Are mobile browsers not able to make simultaneous connections? That seems really surprising, and is (as far as I can tell) the only reason to use data URIs rather than sprites.
You know what they say: Always write your code as if your replacement is a homicidal maniac with an axe-fetish who knows where you live. Or, in your case, where to start scouring the streets.
It should be noted that the rendering time of data-url images is higher than the standard way of including images. Source: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Amm9wgJ9NFxEdEpwaXRKd01mTTF1elVqY0pYUDBEVGc#gid=4
Sprites are far more annoying to use though. Data URIs, on the other hand, can be 100% automated. You can even throw some logic into the mix. E.g. only inlining images which are smaller than x kb or keeping the total size below a specified threshold.
Base64 means 33% bloat. Gzip gets rid of this bloat though. The total number of bytes is roughly the same.
Thinking the same thing... Considering I have found myself in similar types of hell, I would imagine it is one of the following cases: * First project of any real size, inexperienced and now paying for it. (been there, ouch) * A case of the wayward boss, forcing UI decisions that shouldn't be his to make...and thus you end up with the displayed awesomeness. * **Massive** feature creep...first design spec says one popup, and then management rapes your app as they demand for more (*more cowbell* anyone?)
Is there an article which referenced this chart? I'd like to read it.
If you are a little more specific in your description it might help. What do you want to 'track'?
1. what page the user last visited 2. how long their visit lasted 3. what path they took 4. etcetc basically like Google Analytics, but I want to add custom visualizations to the application I'm building.
&gt; I've been messing around with rainbow-colored balls for the better part of last week and I've kinda run out of creativity with them. god, i'm so childish for laughing :D edit: i forgot to say i like it a lot!
I would recommend looking at open source stats packages such as AWStats or Webalizer. These work by examining the log files and as such put no overhead on the browser in terms of download speed, execution time or minimum browser version. Once you have those running you can then tap into their features for generating/extracting the visualisations you require. Another option is to use Google Analytics and tap into their API. If you need to do it via JS then I don't have any experience with existing packages for this. However the basic premise would be to create a library to record the data required. So you would include the library in your document HEAD, then execute the log function once loaded. This would then make an ajax call to your application giving the required information such as their IP address, URL, sessionId etc. This would then be saved to your DB/files. Your back-end software would then analyze the recorded data to determine their session time, path through the site etc. 
iPhone and Android browsers do concurrent connections. I think they both can do 4 right now (iPhone used to do 6 but got reduced). But, I think other far crappier browsers, like the ones you typically find on feature phones, aren't going to have multiple connections. And, on slow mobile connections, I would guess the latency involved in making each request would cause delays.
http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2011/pure-css3-images-hmm-maybe-later/
The IE images were f-ing hilarious. Heh. Totally forgot that it's perfplanet time again! :)
They can do simultaneous connections. But there is an HTTP overhead, so it's always good practise to minimise it.
There are other uses for base64 encoded image than those described here. You may know that images transferred in cross-domain requests to a browser aren't analyzable using *getImageData*. I use this encoding to circumvent this limit. 
as x-skeww said, it should be about ~30% increase. Turn on gzip in your webserver and that number goes down, I've seen ppl say to just a 10% increase.
the generated css should be put in an external stylesheet that should be cached. the "inline"-part in the header was ment for the images (which are inlined in the css), not for the css.
The design was based on 3 factors 1. A need/desire to mimic the ancient VB6 app currently in use -- a refeshless page does not need to mantain much/if-any state information on the server, and it gives the user a similar experience to their day-to-day mac/windows/nix usage. 1. An attempt to reduce bandwidth consumption through refreshlessness and strictly raw data to and from the server. 1. Sheer joy in finding Mootools back in february and being able to use a class-y javascript. I Could finally do away with server side UI creation. 1. Animate all the things. The Image submitted is exaggerated, in that, at most you might have 1-3 windows open at any given time. Management did want the forms to be visually similar to the old vb6 app, but the rest was all me. It's a fairly small app 40-50 tables but it is my first pure javascript app and had to learn on the fly; sort-of fell back on old non-web dev patterns.
Those forms don't look like VB6. If you want to go crazy then go full crazy. Next time try backbone.js, it might save your life.
knockout.js is also worth a look. I haven't used backbone.js yet so I can't compare, but knockout.js has met my needs pretty well.
I'll be frank, it's not so much the comments (though they are nice), but just the code as a whole. The solutions are succinct, simple, and the results are nice. It's clearly well thought out and/or researched. You spent time on crafting this, and it shows. So, no, don't thank me. Thank you.
Sprites can be 100% automated too... There's literally hundreds of scripts to generate sprites + css that goes with your sprites. Literally no manual work to do. For example, lets say you use php. Make a config file that contains all the images, any kind of special variables you might need like alignment. Then write a script that reads that config, uses your favorite image library (GD, ImageMagick..) and builds out a sprite sheet.
Hey, I've updated http://ippa.se/base64-image-encoder/ with some more info cause of feedback here. I've also added exprimental IE7 (and below) support by having two background css-properties. One with the base64-data (which presumable IE7- ignores cause it doesn't understand it) and another with a normal link to an external image. By setting "!important" on the data-url chrome and firefox will ignore the external image. The bad thing is that IE8-9 seems to fetch the external image Even though it supports data-urls which makes this an imperfect sollution. I know there's a possible MHTML-workaround but that feels very bloated so I've decided not to use it. If anyone got some tricks up their sleeve that could possible solve this, let me know :)
&gt;Sprites can be 100% automated too... No, you can't automate that yet. We have to wait for the media fragement specification until we can fully automate this. The problem is that you can't specify source and target rectangles like you can do with any 2d drawing API. So, if you want to draw some 20x20 sub region of your sprite sheet, you'll also need a 20x20 container. You can work around that to some degree with generated content, but if you want repeating, you'll have to deal with other complications again. If you want repeating in both directions, you can forget it. Sprites are somewhat less annoying with Compass, but they are still a very crude hack. This kind of usage wasn't anticipated by the spec writers and boy does it show.
Now I am completely sure that I need three to four bottles of mulled wine. This might be first time that I have to drink myself into oblivion because of something someone else has coded.
Usually you want to conceal your website/employer, or else you're exposing yourself to unnecessary risk.
so, how well does this work with keyboard navigation?

Google Analytics would be a great choice. We use Omniture Site Catalyst here at work, and despite the difficulties Site Catalyst imposes, it's really a great tool. 
The guys in /r/crappydesign will like this.
thanks for your input. I was only aware that the document.write method should be avoided. I did not know it prevented the DOM from loading. I m just learning about this but I know that can basically throw a wrench into the whole webpage. 
i think the document.write method even screws with reddit. I got an error when I wrote it with the parentheses.
Does the client mind? Did they pay you to do usability testing or create an attractive design? It's not pretty, but if it suits the client's budget, then you built what they deserved. Creating attractive, usable designs for complex data applications is not a trivial process, and doesn't cost trivial money. Props for being able to laugh a bit at it though.
Obviously repeating textures are the odd one in the bunch, and really if you have more than one repeating in all directions you've got more problems than sprites. I'm not sure what you're on about though. We completely automatic it at work exactly the way I stated above. We can specify if we want it horizontal or vertical. All we have to do is link the generated css file (gets mashed with the other css files) and be on our way. Sometimes you have to tweak your html, but quite frankly it's not all that bad. We also have the ability to add padding to the sprite sheet, so if we don't want all the sprites to be right up next to each other, that's no problem. Size wise it doesn't add a significant amount of extra data to the file. There's a reason the tops sites on the net (like where I work) use sprites. And to add, we've tried using data-uris in our stylesheets. Making them work cross browser was more work than it should have been.
I am going to assume that you are talking about running analytics on domains other than your own. On the client side (in the web page itself, in the browser): - you will need a script that makes a request to your web server. this could be an jsonp request, or even an image request. from this request, your server will know: - the time of the request - the user agent string of the browser (which browser/version/os etc) - the ip address of the user's router - the url of the page that they are on - any cookies set by your server or the browser (a unique id perhaps) - watch out for x-domain issues here - default browser language - you can look at the http referer [sic] of the first request to see which page they came in from, for example they came in from http://google.com?where+can+i+find+cheap+bacon , then you know what they were searching for too. from that, you can determine - the difference in time between page requests, which you can assume as the time on page - the path that they took through your site by looking at the timestamps if you want to be a little more advanced, you can use javascript to get the following and send to the server: - their screen resolution and colour depth - you could track in-page links (# anchor tags) - mouse movements (if they don't use mouse for 5 min before next request, you can assume they are not reading the page) - slightly evil + performance issues good luck
Use Google Analytics but tap into their [export API](http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/gdata/home.html) to add the custom visualizations to your own application.
&gt;repeating textures are the odd one in the bunch &gt;Sometimes you have to tweak your html &gt;We also have the ability to add padding to the sprite sheet "100% automatic" means that there isn't *any* kind of human intervention necessary. It means that you flick one switch and that's it.
And here I thought it was a hilarious parody of node.js
Try the logout button :D
Sorry but I don't mind having one image out of many images be manual. 99% automated then if you want to get technical...
If you don't want to use GA, check out [Piwik](http://piwik.org/).
Ugh... some windows have drop-shadows but others don't, *and* the drop shadow colour is grey (not a black with transparency) so the content below fades to grey which ruins the 3d effect, making it looks like a grey halo rather than a drop-shadow. Nice work. 
I'm a big fan of mixpanel, and they have a js library you can incorporate in your js, as well as those you can use in your server side code.
tnx pitpat, fixed.

You've successfully made CRM. Good job.
K.I.S.S. Keep it stupidly simple.
Yes, thx a lot!
Didn't do any usability analysis, hmm? What have you done?!
Maybe this will help you, I use this for one of my projects to check if an iframe is loaded, etc. [https://gist.github.com/1469593](https://gist.github.com/1469593)
You have 3 distinct pieces there: `(2*i)` is the operation that is invoked by the "yield" in the prototype. The resulting value is returned and inserted into the resulting list. `for (i in 101)` invokes the iterator method of 101, which is defined by overriding the iterator property of the Number prototype. The iterator itself loops from 0..i-1, then invokes the operation (`2 * i`, in our case) by passing the value of that loop to it. `if (i * i &lt; 3)` is a postfix conditional; the result of the yield is only appended to the list if this condition passes. So, when `i` is 0 or 1, the condition fails, and nothing is appended to the list. For the next value, 2 * 2 &gt; 3, so the value of 2*2 (4) is appended to the resulting list. The next value, 3, also passes the test (3 * 3 = 9 &gt; 3), so the value of 2 * 3 (6) is appended to the resulting list, and so on and so forth, up to i = 100. The non-list-comprehension equivalent would be something like: var results = []; for(i = 0; i &lt; 101; i++) { if(i * i &gt; 3) { results.push(2 * i); } } return results; Which is obviously far more verbose and less awesome. This is somewhat tricky, because you're treating a number like a list, which isn't necessarily very intuitive. A better example might be: s = [v.toUpperCase() for (v in ['a', 'b', 'c']) if (v != 'b') ] This is more obvious; for each value in `['a', 'b', 'c']`, the value is uppercased and the result is appended to the list (unless the value == 'b'). The result of this comprehension would be `['A', 'C']`.
Ah, yes, I totally agree. I might have misunderstood your original comment...
&gt; The reason why I would personally avoid dynamic javascript is because it's nice to be able to have static scripts that are cacheable on the client. Dynamic markup is unavoidable. You can cache dynamically generated javascript on the client side still. Just return a 304 Not Modified depending on the date. This is academic, being it is I misunderstood the original comment, but still possible...
Check out qooxdoo, you'll like it. And it looks a lot more native.
I think the IE7 Compatibility option is working good now! With the last hack IE9 still downloaded the image even though it should have used the data-url. Now IE9 ignores it. Used the classic *-css hack that should only work in IE7. The order of the two background-properties was also important.
Note for readers: it's "\_\_iterator\_\_"; "__iterator__" is reddit's interpretation. Also, note that this is not valid till 1.8. Note for OP: indent your code by 4 spaces, and it'll look like code (no special markup added).
I'd say it's almost always best to cast variables to what you expect them to be. In the real world, that usually just means converting strings into numbers. Also never use `==` (type guessing is not your friend). It's best to know early on that `===` is the only comparison operator worth using. `parseInt` is a tricky function because it will guess the radix of the number if you let it. Always give the radix as the 2nd parameter: var thisIsOctal = parseInt('0900'); var thisIsADecimal = parseInt('0900', 10); console.log(thisIsOctal); console.log(thisIsADecimal); The first one fails because 9 is not a valid octal digit.
I was inspired by JS1K, so I've spent the last three hours poking and prodding my code until it fit in a nice, byte-sized (ho ho! I'm so clever!) 1023-byte package. Unfortunately, I was four bytes too large, so I had to reduce the particle count from 500 to 98. Oh well; it still looks pretty. http://soofw.com/heartm/ Demo http://soofw.com/heartm/big.js Ugly code with _some_ whitespace http://soofw.com/heartm/biggest.js Pretty code
[Have a fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/jCPgW/) If you aren't using jQuery you can probably do: document.getElementById("colors").value = &lt;selected colour&gt;
 var colors = document.getElementById('colors'); var options = colors.options; // options is an array if (colors[colors.selectedIndex].value == 'red') { colors.selectedIndex = 1; } That example shows a few of the properties of the options array that should help get you started.
Thanks. That helps a lot. Is there a particular name for this kind of for loop?
n/p!
Ok, _Now_ it works :]. Confirmed with http://netrenderer.com/index.php
It's _ok_....but it's written as if it's expected to be presented alongside an aural presentation, and so the slides are not fully-contained and are lacking in context or explanation in many areas. If you're looking to get up-to-speed on ES5, you might want to look elsewhere; OTOH, if you plan on giving a talk about ES5 and don't want to make your own slides, then this might be perfect for you.
You do this so that you can use $ as the selector function (or whatever that is) without stealing the $ from other libraries.
jQuery noConflict() mode. Plenty of benefits. Your code isn't cluttering the global namespace, and jquery doesn't hijack the $-grabber - yet inside the closure you referenced, you can $-grab all day long.
for in loop https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in
The global $ variable is an alias (reference) for the global jQuery object. Some other libraries may have their own uses for the global $ variable such as Prototype.js. As an example, if jQuery then Prototype were loaded, the global $ variable wouldn't behave as you'd expect since Prototype had overwritten it with its own definition. To continue using jQuery like the way most usually do (with the "$()"), you create a closure with the local variable named $ that references the jQuery object, otherwise you'll have to write jQuery() everywhere incase a script or library overwrites the $ variable. Another reason I'd use it for is performance. Accessing variables stored on the global scope is much slower in some browsers than accessing it on the local scope. 
It becomes scoped as a local variable inside that function. $ = prototype in the global scope (function($) { $ = jQuery here })(jQuery);
The full expanded version of that should really look something more like this: ( function ( $, undefined ) { ... } (jQuery) ); Where "$" not only takes on the jQuery variable but protects it from the rest of the global namespace, but "undefined" gets passed into your production code as truly undefined. I've seen some ugly hijacks where "undefined" is remapped to do some truly nasty damage-- this is one of the cleanest ways to protect your code in scope, as well as protect one of the easiest globals to redefine.
~~Strictly speaking, *undefined* is just a name you can use for a variable, not a global that has a pre-defined meaning/value. However, as long as you don't assign a value to it, it can be used to test other variables.~~ My apologies, I stand corrected.
I can't tell what the program is doing but that kind of obfuscation is rarely legitimate.
I don't get it. I entered: (function() {})() alert(2+2); Code wasn't minified. Code wasn't prettified. Code was not changed at all. What's the difference between the "pretty diff" and a normal diff? It doesn't seem to "know" JavaScript. Also, those pop-ups are a pain.
That's what I was thinking, thanks! I couldn't pick out anything distinct from it and I usually can. It's mostly curiosity at this point, just trying to figure out if the site was compromised in any way.
EDIT: I updated the language auto-detection to default to JavaScript for minify and beautify operations and to Plain Text for diff operations. You can see what language I am detecting by looking in the "Minify Report".
Why don't you post the source on gist.github, pastebin or something?
Yes
Paste the code here: [http://jsbeautifier.org/](http://jsbeautifier.org/) and alot of the code will be deobfuscated. If it won't fix the strings you can just paste it into the js console in Chrome (should work in firefox as well). Make sure to wrap it inside a `function() { place code here }` so you don't execute it.
Yes
Yep. What everybody else said... "isolation" I tend to be even a bit more extreme (sometimes) and will pass in window / document instead of reaching out into global scope to grab it. function foo( _window, operation, value ) { _window.alert( "op: " + operation + ", val: " + value ); } That is a dumb / contrived example, but then it means you can more easily provide a replacement function for "window.alert" ie: foo( { "alert": function() { ... } }, "add", 10 ); ...otherwise your code implicitly depends on being run in a browser environment and it might make it harder than necessary to test eg: with command-line "rhino" or "v8" unit tests. --Robert
Can Elm compile to some XML equivalent, even XHTML 1.1, in addition to HTML? I have found the browser errors about faulty markup injection to an XML document from JavaScript to be pretty worthless while the code is still failing in the background. If Elm can compile to XML/CSS/JavaScript in this far less forgiving environment I will be an immediate fan. In the mean time +1 for a good start on an ambitious project.
It's not something I really need to invest much time in, I know the site doesn't require it and--malicious or benign--I'd rather just remove it and move on with other projects... I appreciate the suggestion though.
His point was that someone could de-obfuscate it and tell you definitively what it does if only you'd posted it in a textual manner instead of a screenshot, which is useless to everyone involved. Never post code as an image, it's just rude.

That sort of obfuscation is almost always bad, but you're borderline trolling by pasting a IMAGE of CODE. That's retarded, and a pretty good way to prevent yourself from getting help. I promise, it would have taken LESS TIME to paste the code into pastiebin, and you would have gotten a wealth of information to use in making yourself look smart in front of your boss. As someone that leads a team of engineers, I would honestly be very concerned if you displayed the attitude of: "meh, I'll just take it off of the page." Showing a general lack of curiosity is career poison if your boss is doing his job.
A higher level programming language for a higher level programming language that runs on a higher level programming language. It's like inception.
So you decided to take a screenshot and upload the image instead, because that takes less time than marking text and paste it to jsfiddle? What a douche.
yea because being ignorant of the golden rule of never pasting code of an image makes me a douche. right. sorry for posting about a curiosity - i've really never received such a hostile reception on reddit before.
Not true, it does have the predefined value `undefined`, unlike an arbitrary not defined variable such as `x`.
Please tell us *WHY* you're trying to make a gallery and we can potentially help. Why did you post this in /r/javascript? Are you trying to learn a language/programming/architecture? Is this for a client? will a premade solution work? do you have experience with any languages? Do you have a specific server setup or hosting requirements (iis, apache)? Your question is way too vague to have any single answer.
Slide 53 vs 55. Improvement :P Anyway, I like the presentation, no unnecessary text.
The other posters have probably nailed it. I've seen stuff like that before and it was never good. Make sure your site isn't compromised, someone had to have access to your server to add that to the code being served. OR, you could be making a call to an outside service that is writing that code into the DOM. If you're using any kind of "open source" project in your site (os commerce, PHPBB, wordpress, etc...) make sure you're on the current version and fully patched. The "bad guys" often target these kinds of projects for vulnerabilities that will allow them to compromise the site. Also, make sure if you're taking any form input anywhere that you are fully sanitizing user inputs ... the security hole could be in your own code.
Ok, perhaps I should chosen better words. It is interesting and you made us curious too, but we can't do anything with an image and you won't take the time to post the source even when we ask for it.
Ok, so this has nothing to with Javascript really. And since you need a solution, it sounds like you're doing this for a website/project requirement rather than a learning experience. Go with a pre-existing solution from [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_photo_gallery_software#Server_applications).
... Especially considering this particular script embeds a hidden iframe and an input box onto the page and makes the site vulnerable to all sorts of cross site attacks.
This does not belong in this sub-Reddit. That said, you might look at Plogger.
Javascript is typically seen as a client side language and wouldn't have a way of uploading new images, or pulling gallery data directly from the database without a server-side language like php, ruby, python. If you have no programming experience with any language, you may find getting started is not straight-forward (there's a big learning curve to programming). But if you're going to do it from scratch instead of a pre-existing solution, I'd recommend picking a server-side language and doing a google search for `tutorial creating image gallery &lt;your language&gt;` -- You'll get results, to give you guidance. Good luck.
Correct. Demonstration: &gt;&gt;&gt; 'foo' in window; false &gt;&gt;&gt; 'undefined' in window; true
I'll wait for Pine to come out.
It looks like you got hacked. Can you copy and paste it? I can convert those characters into legible text, then paste it into js beautifier, and we can tell you *exactly* what it does. But I'm not hand typing that shit.
Ok since there are a few people here crying foul. To those of you: sorry. I didn't realize what a faux-pas pasting an image here was. I was in a hurry and had a graphics editor open and since like I mentioned **I don't often work directly with JS** I wasn't aware of jsFiddle. To those of you who gave a point in the right direction regardless of my misstep: thank you. You answered my real question which was whether or not we got hacked and if it was something I should clean out of the site, or if it should be left alone. For the curious / interested: I'll grab it when I go back to work tomorrow and post it up.
Doesn't seem to know about ASI when I eventually got it into JavaScript mode. Doesn't seem to be very smart at all. Diff: (function() { var x = 'hello world'; alert(x); }()); and: (function() {})() alert(2+ 2); The diff is a mess. It didn't detect that "alert" was the same. It does better on small changes (dot to bracket notation, for example), but horribly on things line diffs are good at (which is mostly what people care about). Non-contrived example: // Before function globalRequire() { var args = un.parseRequireArguments(arguments); un.execute(args.deps, globalConfiguration, args.callback, function (errs, value) { if (errs) throw errs; }); } // TODO Rename to unrequire and have unrequire.load window.require = globalRequire; window.require.definePackage = function (rawPackageName, rawModuleNames) { un.definePackage(rawPackageName, rawModuleNames, globalConfiguration); }; // After function globalRequire() { var args = un['parseRequireArguments'](arguments); un['execute'](args['deps'], globalConfiguration, args['callback'], function (errs, value) { if (errs) throw errs; }); } globalRequire['definePackage'] = function definePackage(rawPackageName, rawModuleNames) { un['definePackage'](rawPackageName, rawModuleNames, globalConfiguration); }; // TODO Rename to unrequire and have unrequire.load window['require'] = globalRequire; 
Automatic semicolon insertion is not enabled in 'diff' mode. It is only enabled in 'minify' mode. Automatic semicolon insertion would radically change the input and thus corrupt the code comparison in several edge cases. The link provided links directly to the 'minify' mode of the application automatically. &gt; The diff is a mess. It didn't detect that "alert" was the same. Why would it? One is inside a function and the other is not and they each contain different content. If the alerts were reported as the same then there would certainly be a problem. The diff algorithm on the remainder of your code samples is working as designed.
Well, a reputable developer actually recommends against dog-balling closures... it should look like (function($) { }(jQuery));
It seems to be putting a iframe with the following url onto the page. http://193.105.240.188/admin.php?shname=recatpcha recatpcha for your site? *Edit: JSFiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/QGwXp/
I don't suppose you've got some reading on not using javascript in a browser you could link. 
What happens if you do this with a jquery already loaded. Using 2 jquery versions at the same time.
Unless you're going to be using Node, this is not the reddit you're looking for. You could make a gallery using any of the languages you've listed (except Pearl) The simplest way will depend on the technology available on your server. 
html/css/js should be thought of as assembly? What? I think web developers will not find a statically typed programming language easier than a markup language
Your question is a little ambiguous, but essentially when this block of code is run: (function($) { // Code here in closure })(jQuery) inside the closure $ is equal to whatever jQuery was when this block was run. If you load 2 jQuery versions before running the block, it's whatever was loaded second. If you load one version, then run this, then another, inside the closure it's the first one. If you run this before loading them, you'll probably get a reference error.
Comment it out and see what breaks/stops working. It also might be worth investigating the HTTP Requests made when loading the website to see if anything strange is being loaded or sent to/from an external domain.
&gt; Automatic semicolon insertion would radically change the input and thus corrupt the code comparison in several edge cases. That's not what the title of the original post leads me to believe: &gt; Automatic semicolon insertion with JSMin at Pretty Diff. It sounds like you've used JSMin to add ASI to Pretty Diff. I don't see what ASI has to do with JSMin otherwise. (ASI is required for a full JavaScript parser.) &gt; &gt; The diff is a mess. It didn't detect that "alert" was the same. &gt; &gt; Why would it? One is inside a function and the other is not and they each contain different content. If the alerts were reported as the same then there would certainly be a problem. I meant that the "alert" *name* wasn't detected as the same. Of course the entire call wouldn't be detected as the same. 
yeah dude lets run a Rails abstraction on top of that shit. Web scale bitches!
People seem to dislike static typing because they have only seen it in the context of C or Java. Functional programming is a totally different ball game. I think static types get a bad reputation in some circles just because people haven't seen it done well (i.e. with [Hindley-Milner type-inference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner) or another more complicated inference scheme). Mature functional languages like OCaml and Haskell are great examples of statically-typed languages that, in my experience, end up being more concise and more *reliable* than dynamically-typed languages like JS and Python. I personally tend to write code that is much less bug prone in functional languages. Definitely take a detailed look at Elm, OCaml, or Haskell before you decide that static types are a bad thing! P.S. Elm is my senior thesis. Edit: made things less combative.
[node.js](http://nodejs.org/) is really popular right now. It's server-side javascript.

By splitting it up into "what enhancements do I want" and "apply enhancements", you can test the *hell* out of your getEnhancements function (b/c it is just verifying an array / data structure). Then you can have one test which visually tests that all your known enhancements can be applied properly. And it is likely that any defects you have related to the application of enhancements will be "structural" moreso than "individual" (ie: you'll get one bug report that says: "glitter stopped working" or "no enhancements applied anywhere") and you're more likely to catch those massive breakages in basic adhoc testing instead of waiting till much later where all those things need to be tested individually (since the goal would be to do 90% of your testing via unit testing and the 10% visual verification b/c you'll need eyeballs before deployment no matter what). --Robert
I'm really not getting this. If this is for fun, then be my guest; if this is because eval is poorly written or something, then that needs to be shown; if this is a claim that somehow you can run some javascript snippet on top of this javascript interpreter faster than you could doing just the snippet directly, then you will need a lot of pudding for that kind of proof.
Nicely done. If you like Pygame, you should look at [GameJs](http://gamejs.org/), since it appears to be based on Pygame. I have used [sprite.js](https://github.com/batiste/sprite.js/), and it is pretty good and should only take an hour or two to pick up. If you would be willing to pay (quite a bit of) money for an engine, I have heard good things about [Impact](http://impactjs.com/).
Why do you use new Object() instead of {}? And, why don't you make your own library? You seem to have a lot of the pieces you'd need...
Impact is amazing. $99 is a complete *steal*. All the work that's done for you already would have cost you thousands and hundreds of hours that could have been spent actually building your game.
So essentially it is done just in case there are other libraries using $?. But, in practice $ is still defined outside the closure unless you call jQuery.noConflict(). Also, I'm assuming the reason this isn't done like this: https://gist.github.com/1475402 is due to cross-browser support for the with keyword. So essentially some obscene barely readable syntax is being introduced as a best practice in the off-chance that someone decides to introduce a conflicting usage library? Aren't most libraries that use $ designed to not be used concurrently, and if they are being used concurrently don't most libraries provide methods for preventing conflicts? I think there are legitimate concerns regarding using the originally described structure as a best practice, and am curious as to the depth of dialog within the javascript community in thoroughly evaluating alternative approaches before this becomes an accepted standard. 
There's a lot more to dealing with code than executing it. UglifyJS is an example of a JavaScript parser (written in JavaScript) which doesn't execute; it minifies code.
That's Crockfords way of doing it. The other way around (external parentheses) is fully valid Javascript. I respect alot of Crockfords dogmas, but in this case I find it more intuitive the other way around.
&gt; I find it more intuitive the other way around. I do too-When I see the parens I know *x* function is executed. It's fun to say though ;-) ()dogballs()
&gt; So essentially it is done just in case there are other libraries using $? Yes, and in case you want to use it yourself. It's just a regular variable. &gt; Also, I'm assuming the reason this isn't done like this: [1] https://gist.github.com/1475402 is due to cross-browser support for the with keyword. `with` is considered harmful, it's deprecated and not allowed in javascript strict mode. &gt; So essentially some obscene barely readable syntax is being introduced as a best practice in the off-chance that someone decides to introduce a conflicting usage library? This "obscene barely readable syntax" is the only way you can create scopes in Javascript. It's also part of one of the most popular design patterns in Javascript; the module pattern. It's more or less standard to put all your code inside scopes to prevent namespace collisions in the global namespace. &gt; Aren't most libraries that use $ designed to not be used concurrently, and if they are being used concurrently don't most libraries provide methods for preventing conflicts? No, any library is free to use `$` and it should NOT be exclusive to any single lib. `$` is just syntactic sugar, a lib should not rely on this variable. &gt; I think there are legitimate concerns regarding using the originally described structure as a best practice, and am curious as to the depth of dialog within the javascript community in thoroughly evaluating alternative approaches before this becomes an accepted standard. This is the result of years of Javascript implementations and discussions. Things are on the move, but sometimes very slow. That's why competitors such as Google Dart appears. The `let` keyword seems to become a future standard for creating variable scopes. More on `let`: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/New_in_JavaScript_1.7#Block_scope_with_let_(Merge_into_let_Statement) EDIT: I misused the keyword closure when I actually meant scope.
[Here you go. :)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_\(email_client\))
&gt;People seem to dislike static typing because they have only seen it in the context of C or Java. Functional programming is a totally different ball game. I agree. Everyone should learn some Haskell to experience a new love for static typing.
There's http://cocos2d-javascript.org/. If you have Nodejs installed I recommend trying the unstable version as it's close to what the next version will be like.
I beat it :). The final one was pretty hard. Nice canvas game. You can [try mine out](http://96.60.240.24:5643/canvas/gravity), if you want. Click and drag stuff around :).
I really like craftyjs.com, open source and really well structured. The main thing I like is It uses components rather than inheritence (what most c++ engines use) for game objects which makes way more sense for javascript based engines. You can learn more about it at http://cowboyprogramming.com/2007/01/05/evolve-your-heirachy/
&gt; The let keyword seems to become a future standard for creating variable scopes. I agree with you regarding the let keyword. This is the ideal goal all these methods are shooting for. &gt; with is considered harmful,it's deprecated and not allowed in javascript strict mode. I looked into some of the articles from a while back stating that the with keyword should be considered harmful. e.g. http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2006/04/11/with-statement-considered-harmful/. The reasons stated don't seem to apply to this situation, the stated reasons involve ambiguity in whether the arguments given to the with statement receive calls from within the block or an outer context. In this case, we are not modifying the arguments supplied to with, so there is not quite the same case for ambiguity. Nevertheless, I agree there seems to be a movement to build a lingua franca above javascript which implements this feature among other much-needed features. e.g. dart, coffeescript, clojurescript, roy ... &gt; This "obscene barely readable syntax" is the only way you can create closures in Javascript. It's also part of one of the most popular design patterns in Javascript; What i'm refering to is not the use of the module pattern or the syntax for closures in javascript. There are many examples of the module pattern out there, most of them assign the function to a variable for clarity. e.g. https://gist.github.com/1475684. I'm simply saying that the (function(namespace){}(namespace)) is not as clear as var myApp=function($){}(jQuery)) At the very least, if the goal of this practice is to avoid collisions, and the .noConflict() methods return their underlying libs, then we shouldn't we be using this to pass in the namespace while simultaneously ensuring no conflicts occur outside of the block? https://gist.github.com/1475693 
&gt;&gt; --Robert &gt; --Robert Just FYI, you don't have to do that every time. We already know everything we want to about who you are by your username above the post. &lt;:-)
Actually I think a lot of people dislike it because during the exploratory "feeling your way" phase of many projects it's just one more thing to think about, wheras dynamic typing allows you to stuff values into variables quickly without the cognitive overhead of ensuring you go back and change the type of the variable or define additional variables first. Dynamic typing is good for scripting and exploratory programming, but lacks rigour and safety/sanity-checking for larger or more pre-planned projects. Static typing imposes slight additional cognitive overhead in initial exploratory programming, but gives extra safety when implementing planned code or large codebases with many developers. Neither system is universally good or bad, and nobody's wrong for having a preference - while each has a situation it's best for, it's a value-neutral decision. It's like seat-belts - great safety feature in cars (even if it takes you the extra second or two to put it on), ridiculous over-engineering in a kid's pedal-car.
What about Node?
Thanks, that's a good idea. I would like to make it as customizable as possible, so I think I'll go for the lower contrast as default.
Ah, great stuff... I'm still quite new, so didn't even know one can do that. :P Thanks!
Not at all at the moment... good point. Definitely something I'll look into. Thanks.
Ok, seems like I misunderstood you a bit. &gt; I'm simply saying that the (function(namespace){}(namespace)) is not as clear as var myApp=function($){}(jQuery)) It depends on what you want to achieve. There are so many use cases where I can see one being more useful than the other. I see no real harm in assigning your app's single entrypoint to a non-generic global variable to make testing and debugging easier. In an ideal world no lib would pollute the global namespace but in practice it would require too much work. &gt; At the very least, if the goal of this practice is to avoid collisions, and the .noConflict() methods return their underlying libs, then we shouldn't we be using this to pass in the namespace while simultaneously ensuring no conflicts occur outside of the block? The risk I see is you sooner or later have to depend on someones code where this hasn't been taken into account (for instance some code relying on that the global `$` is jQuery). It's beyond your project's responsibility to control the surrounding/global environment. It should only make sure not to pollute it any more than necessary. So I believe the best practice is not to mess with things that are outside your project as long as it doesn't affect your project.
I also heard that the dude selling it is really nice :) *cough*
For a board game I used easeljs with tweenjs to animate the pieces. Don't know what it's like for more complex games, but it's good for this.
http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ is pretty amazing, but the learning curve also seems pretty steep to me.
There are two reasons why you do it. 1) You enclose it in an anonymous function so you don't leak out your variables into the global scope. 2) You pass in a variable so you can reference it inside the function. Now you don't have to pass a variable in as a parameter, you could always refer to it in the function as it's a closure and it has access to the global scope BUT it's faster if you reference it as it'll be a local variable. Plus there's the added benefit of using a shorthand name for the variable. It doesn't make testing more difficult since you should be testing what you export and what you export should be using what's inside those functions so you'll still have 100% code coverage. Hope that helps!
I'm really liking esprima, not only is it fast but the code is really nice and neat.
I'm in love with this library http://cocos2d-javascript.org/ It provides a good asset pipeline, extra JS OOP classes (with getters/setters/events) and animation.
&gt; That's not what the title of the original post leads me to believe: ASI is available at Pretty Diff exemplified by the link provided. I could make ASI an option so that it can be turned off in the diff operation. &gt; It sounds like you've used JSMin to add ASI to Pretty Diff. I have used Pretty Diff to add ASI to my custom fork of JSMin. &gt; I don't see what ASI has to do with JSMin otherwise. JSMin is a minifier. If you minify code that is reliant upon ASI the code will break if ASI is not available in the minifier. &gt; I meant that the "alert" name wasn't detected as the same. The diff algorithm present in the tool is not a word diff. In a word diff alphanumeric characters minus other English language grammar characters as space separated data points for comparison. The algorithm in the tool is a code diff that is capable of comparing text. This means that it treats space characters, post minification, as unique characters like any other. Currently, the text comparison ability of the diff algorithm is fully internationalized with regard to UTF8 mappings. In my opinion an English compatible word diff is in conflict with internationalization. This is because languages like Farsi, Urdu, and some Hindi like languages use white space characters in completely different ways, such as zero width space and zero width non-joiner characters. Space characters do not occur in those languages as they do in European languages. Further more words in some languages, particularly Swahili, are not comparable to words in European languages. One word in Swahili is roughly comparable to a fully expressive primitive statement in a European language. Therefore, my conclusion is that an English compatible word diff would break logical text comparisons in other languages, or at the very least render the comparisons largely worthless. Furthermore, the contextual placement of alert in reference to the other available code is different, and so those lines must be viewed as inherently different even if they can contain a similar word. The diff operation used for code is inherently algorithmic to the code, and so context is valued. If this algorithmic nature is not valued then just use the "Plain Text" language type when performing a diff and that should solve your concern.
I am down voting you because I find your point to be both valid and the popular opinion, but I completely disagree. I know most developers do not consider markup languages to be very complex, but I disagree. In my opinion markup languages are significantly more complicated and powerful with regards to expression, relationship, and parsing than programming languages of a regular syntax. I know most developers do not think this way, but that is probably because most developers do use markup languages other than HTML. HTML allows sloppy crap that is almost never well formed and, considering pages on the web as a percentage, absolutely never valid. That said I can only conclude this popular opinion on markup languages is probably based on the notion that markup languages aren't worth a crap anyways.
I agree that people who write garbage will continue to do so in any form available. It is not logical to replace logic with something more verbally familiar. If I were to take that same argument to the next level and apply to natural language I would say we need to drop English in favor of Swahili, because it is a semantic language instead of a relational language. I would also say we need to abandon the use of an alphabet in favor a syllabary, because that is certainly a newer and far superior technology. These two changes would radically increase learning and allow programming to far more easily bridge the human-computer AI gap, but it is not logical to think that superior technologies are superior in a vacuum. CoffeeScript appears to move in the opposite of this direction by favor English language expression over logical expression.
&gt; `wash plate, brush, sink for key, plate of dishes when plate.dirty if meal.status is 'done'` `if (meal.status === 'done') for (var key in dishes) if (dishes[key].dirty) wash(dishes[key], brush, sink);` We can play this stupid game all day long.
Very good answer. You should do exactly that: comment the code and test if something is broken
Nice view!
This article made me rage inside. 1. Just because you can write nasty code in a language means you shouldn't use it? The examples were horrible; you can write shitty one-liners in JS too. Sure, array comprehensions make one-liners easier, but anyone worth their beans knows not to overdo it. 2. You don't have to compile your code every time. If you run coffee instead of node or use coffee --watch it will take care of it for you. Using the coffee command also helps with debugging. 3. "I actually have to read all the and characters in the CoffeeScript." - Nobody is putting a gun to your head and telling you not to use &amp;&amp; or ||. It's simply an option There are some legitimate issues with coffee-script, sure. None of them were covered. I am by no means a coffee-script fanboy but this irrational hate/fear of new languages in the programming community is starting to get on my nerves.
Just as an FYI, as this post might be popular... Never use the "in" clause to enumerate the elements of the array unless you pair it with "hasOwnProperty". Even then, just don't. It will bite you in the ass when some other library modifies the array prototype. Watch Douglas Crockfords videos about Javascript. They will teach you tons.
I have a better reason than this article: google closure -advanced_mode
Yeah, dishes is an object.
Same issue. If the object has a prototype added to it, the in clause will enumerate it, and "dishes[function]" will not behave.
I've tried them all, and [Angular](http://angularjs.org/) is the best IMO. I think it's designed the best. But the real answer is to just try them all and see which one fits your needs.
I couldn't agree more with you and the irrational fear has always been a part of this industry. I remember when Java hit the scene and it was the exact same outburst for a multitude of reasons: 1) Interpolation is slow 2) no 'pointer math' 3) GC will halt your process and cause an unacceptable delay for the user etc.. 
you probably didn't get the point Elm is trying to reach, didn't you? :)
I am not a coffeescript user I have just been reading about it and deciding if its something I should pursue. His arguments about the added complexity when debugging make sense to me. I use the hell out of JS debugger (Firebug and whatever the one in chrome/safari is called). Seems from my (admittedly uninformed) view point that debugging would be much harder in coffee. Exactly what the author highlighted, Use debugger and find problem in JS then have to "decode" the JS to identify the section of CS which generated it. Solve problem in CS recompile, test. Rinse repeat. How does the coffee command help me with this? Also while figuring out which section of CS generated the problem JS may be fairly straight forward in small sections of code or code I wrote and am VERY familiar with... I would imagine its going to be harder when working with a large amount of CS and/or CS written by someone else whose style may be very different than mine. Seems to me like maybe we are making development faster but making maintenance harder and more time consuming? I am not anti-CS I really havent made up my mind. But so far I also really am not sold on what CS is going to buy me. 
I don't know exactly, you should ask the author ([wheatBread](http://www.reddit.com/user/wheatBread)), but I suppose it's only a matter of switching the "printer" module or the output template or whatever it is that spits out HTML. Anyway I don't think it's in his immediate concern, since he stated that he's focused on web programming with Elm, so I don't see any XML output for now. Yeah, it's really a clever and ambitious project, I hope it will grow further!
yeah, actual web languages SHOULD be thought of as assembly: http://www.hanselman.com/blog/JavaScriptIsAssemblyLanguageForTheWebSematicMarkupIsDeadCleanVsMachinecodedHTML.aspx
Not that I entirely disagree with you, but the GC thing was, to the best of my understanding, *entirely* accurate back then. Even now, with many more advanced GC algorithms in the JVM and gobs of memory that were difficult to even imagine back then, GC still causes pauses sometimes, which is why real-time systems don't use it.
And there's a CoffeeScript sugar for that ;) for own key, dish of dishes wash dish
I assume you meant google "closure advanced_mode" since the minus will remove all results with advanced_mode
Technically, you could just write a simple "forEach" wrapper on the Array prototype (if it doesn't already exist) and give all arrays the ability to: myArray.forEach(function(value, index, array) { /* loop code */ }); Your logic code doesn't need to concern itself with "hasOwnProperty" at that point. ECMAScript 5 includes this, but it's never a bad time to start. The only thing CoffeeScript does is remove some of the boilerplate and add in a convoluted meaningful white space restriction.
Alright everyone - [here's the jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/SXbMV/). Again, sorry for not posting this way originally. I believe [ultrafusion may be onto something](http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/nbasi/can_anyone_tell_me_what_this_script_might_be_used/c37tg3c) because the client had asked about a captcha a while ago, but I don't think the project ever ended up on our desks.
Its not that simple. In the SGML and text/HTML5 flavors of HTML if you inject incomplete HTML using the innerHTML property the browser will do its best to fill in the gaps as necessary to complete the markup as its building nodes into the DOM on the fly. In the XML flavor this is not the case. The code simply fails and you get a JavaScript error that is worthless. Its only in very recent versions of Firefox that the error points to the correct location in the JavaScript and this pointer is still not always accurate. I also understand that if the HTML string being built by the JavaScript is typically simple to get correct unless the HTML string is built inside an algorithm with multidimensional loop complexity. This is challenging normally in code that I manually write, so I can only imagine accomplishing this objective in a language that compiles to XHTML and JavaScript would be rather ambitious.
depends how you setup your build scripts :) but yeah, i mean WITH advanced mode, without it i would rather use coffee script as well.
If you want to try something a little more advanced, the [Isogenic Engine](http://isogenicengine.com) is new but really great. The prices were just increased though, so its quite a bit more expensive than other options, but if you want to do 2.5D stuff, you can't find better.

Ah that was node.js specific. I will admit that debugging in the browser IS a pain in the ass without installing browser add-ons ([like this](http://spin.atomicobject.com/2011/09/23/coffeescript-in-firebug-console-with-acebug/)). Hopefully in the future when [this](http://www.infoq.com/news/2011/08/debug-languages-on-javascript-vm) is done it won't be a problem anymore.
I was referring to the search specifics itself ;) (I'm not a fan of meaningful whitespace in any language so I'm avoiding CoffeeScript. If they make a revision without this restriction though, I'm on-board with most of the changes.)
If something is being added that shouldn't be enumerated you can cross your fingers and hope it was done right Example: Object.defineProperty(String.prototype, whatevernewFunction, {value: supercoolfunction, enumerable: false});
Thanks, have you written any games using Impact? I'd love to see how they turned out. Frameworks always look easy to use when it's the framework author using it. I certainly don't have any problem with the price tag, but I do prefer open source tools where possible. How do you even distribute a game using a closed-source Javascript library? Do I have to obfuscate my own source code?
&gt; Why do you use new Object() instead of {}? Ha, because I'm an idiot and I'm still learning Javascript. :) I did make a number of pieces I'd need, but I didn't touch keyboard inputs or communicating with a server. Also I have little patience for cross-browser issues. I'm willing to spend time getting my game to work on Chrome, but not so much Chrome, Firefox, Opera, _and_ Safari. Anyway, rolling my own is definitely a possibility, but I'm sure I'm not going to produce anything better than what's already out there!
If you're a .NET developer and you're using or considering CoffeeScript, you owe it to yourself to try [Script#](https://github.com/nikhilk/scriptsharp/).
i have built a few games with Impact, and I think they turned out nice. (I can't link to them yet) The framework does enough for you without getting in your way. I heartily recommend it. Biggest things it gives you: * Class system (using .extend style syntax) * module system (one single script tag to your app) * Entity (define .draw(), .update(), give it a .vel.x and a vel.y and it pretty much works) * Game run loop * collision detection A few other niceties but these are the high points. I'm not sure about JonDum's "hundreds of hours" but even if it was only 10 hours, it is definitely better than averageDevHourlyRate * 10 TLDR: +1 for impactjs
Thanks for a killer framework man. I use it every day at work.
It's also easier to "deprecate" an old library and use something new. If you can go into your old code and tie them to an old version of JQuery by changing one variable at at the bottom you can move on to a newer version in your new code. In the OP's example, I could change jQuery to jQuery.1.4 (and of course, I'd have to make the 1.4 library create this variable) and all code in that block will use the jQuery.1.4 library without any odd bugs creeping in from a version update.
Except that you're entirely wrong there. The default garbage collector in Java exhibits those behaviors, but there are at least three other garbage collectors shipped with ~~Sun's~~ Oracle's JVM. If you want a real time system, there's an entire Java specification for that that guarantees real time responses. If you want to keep with garbage collection though, you can get a deterministic garbage collector that will guarantee pause times &lt;= some value or you can get a garbage collector that is truly pauseless and constantly running. You might have to pay for those latter two (JRockit and Zing, respectively), but they exist and Java is reasonably huge in certain real time systems (finance is a big one). Your information is about a decade out of date.
I specifically said **back then** when I said it was entirely accurate. I'm well aware that the JVM has had different GC options added over the years, and I'm using one in production. In fact, I'm looking forward to trying the G1 collector soon. I'll have to look into Zing, because the last time I looked, there was no hard real-time JVM, only soft real-time.
Thanks, sounds good, do you have any games you've made with it?
Thanks, I've used cocos2d for python and it's not bad. Do you have any games you've made with it?
&gt; ASI is available at Pretty Diff exemplified by the link provided. I could make ASI an option so that it can be turned off in the diff operation. What link? The OP link provides no sample code. &gt; &gt; I don't see what ASI has to do with JSMin otherwise. &gt; JSMin is a minifier. If you minify code that is reliant upon ASI the code will break if ASI is not available in the minifier. As I said, ASI should be part of any JavaScript parser. If you fixed a bug in the JSMin parser, great. But you seem to be selling it as a product/service. Also, the JSMin minifier on your website doesn't seem to work. See my original example; neither whitespace nor constants are folded. Dead code is not eliminated. Trailing semicolon is not eliminated (though its removal is debatable). &gt; &gt; I meant that the "alert" name wasn't detected as the same. &gt; The diff algorithm present in the tool is not a word diff. In a word diff alphanumeric characters minus other English language grammar characters as space separated data points for comparison. The algorithm in the tool is a code diff that is capable of comparing text. This means that it treats space characters, post minification, as unique characters like any other. Because the Pretty Diff diffing tool claims to understand JavaScript, I expected identical identifiers to be treated as identical. I said nothing about words; JavaScript has strict rules about parsing (as I am sure you know). Your diffing behaviour gives *no* advantage over standard unified diffs in my examples, and I argue it's much harder to deal with: http://i.imgur.com/M94dw.png &gt; Furthermore, the contextual placement of alert in reference to the other available code is different, and so those lines must be viewed as inherently different even if they can contain a similar word. The diff operation used for code is inherently algorithmic to the code, and so context is valued. Here's a super trivial example (for whatever reason, the `var` is required to kick the differ into JavaScript mode): // Before (function () { alert('hi'); }()); var x = 42; // After alert('hi'); var x = 42; A standard line diff (and even your "simple diff" mode) will simply remove the function wrapper. A JavaScript-aware diff should do the same thing, as the only thing which changed is the flow control. Instead, I'm given this mess: http://i.imgur.com/41LjX.png The algorithm you use may be useful for binaries, and maybe compressed JavaScript, but it is detrimental and nearly useless for development.
&gt; What link? The OP link provides no sample code. The OP link provides the application in the applicable operating mode. If you want a link with sample code then use the "s" parameter on the page address, as in: http://prettydiff.com/?m=minify&amp;s=http://prettydiff.com/diffview.js &gt; As I said, ASI should be part of any JavaScript parser. A minifier is not a parser. If code is missing semicolons, such as reliant upon ASI from a parser, and is then minified without ASI the code will be broken. &gt; But you seem to be selling it as a product/service. I am not selling anything. The tool is free to use or download without my consent. &gt; Also, the JSMin minifier on your website doesn't seem to work. Do you have a code sample that fails? I have changed the default language detection since your first post. Perhaps you should use the link provided, refresh the page, and try again. Then if you are still having problems please provide a code sample and I will be happy to diagnose the problem. &gt; Dead code is not eliminated. That is the role of an obfuscator and not a minifier. &gt; Because the Pretty Diff diffing tool claims to understand JavaScript, I expected identical identifiers to be treated as identical. They are when they are present in a similar context. This is not the case in your prior examples. What is my motivation in crippling my tool to output false negatives? &gt; Here's a super trivial example (for whatever reason, the var is required to kick the differ into JavaScript mode): Correct. If I cannot guess at your language I default to "Plain Text" in the diff mode. I only changed the default language detection for the "Minify" and "Beautify" modes of the tool. &gt; A standard line diff (and even your "simple diff" mode) will simply remove the function wrapper. A JavaScript-aware diff should do the same thing Then diff using "Plain Text" for your language choice. &gt; The algorithm you use may be useful for binaries, and maybe compressed JavaScript, but it is detrimental and nearly useless for development. The algorithm is useful when used on real code. It is potentially worthless when used on largely incomparable hypotheticals. Garbage in results in garbage out.
If you are simply looking at a Dollar Bill and it's doing nothing then you missed animation, reload the page. -- I loaded this with a collection of other links, and had no clue what the illusion was supposed to be.
Been reading up on CS for work. We have a huge JS code base, some large real time apps, tons of business logic and we're thinking about doing some trial runs with Node.js for more real time interactivity. I'm pretty underwhelmed with CS for that exact reason, maintainability of the CS wouldn't be a problem, and reading it is damn easy. But trouble shooting a bug on staging that comes from QA in an email that only happens in IE 8 if a user has X number of things could be down right nightmarish. I understand that it enforces best practices and efficiency, but with version control and peer reviewed code... so do we. I'm still super on the fence about the whole thing but for me this is my primary concern.
Nothing I can show you. I was working on a dungeon crawler some time ago but never finished, and the source is in a state of reorganization. The writer has some good examples on his website.
This is a normal optical illusion. It's not blowing anyone's mind. nd what the fuck does this have to do with HTML5? This could have been an animated gif and worked just as well.
You owe it to yourself to read a (Ruby/Python/etc) book and get out of that miserable corporate cube farm world that is .net hell. 
 script.addEventListener('error', script.onerror = function() { I.error(dep, arguments); }, true); is the magic bit of code that does it. I haven't done a comparison across browsers for compatibility, but I plan on implementing absolute compatibility by using a timeout as a backup. This is vastly superior to depending on timeouts alone though, since it is instantaneous.
Here is a list of [Canvas Wrappers](https://github.com/bebraw/jswiki/wiki/Canvas-wrappers) and this is a list of [HTML5 Game Engines and Frameworks](https://github.com/bebraw/jswiki/wiki/Game-Engines) I have no experience with them as I wrote my own for [ESDAO](http://www.esdao.com) because I didn't know about most of them or they didn't exist at the time. Edit: fixed wrong word
The debugging issue alone is the deal breaker for me and CoffeeScript. These sorts of things are supposed to speed me up, not slow me down. Also I don't mind writing JS at all. I never understood what people found so offensive about it.
threw this together: http://jsfiddle.net/5ab7W/ let me know if anything doesn't make sense. You'll need to store your extra information in some format you can parse when the select field changes. I like xml, but you may prefer JSON
No thanks, I work from home.
Hmm, That kind of works - I take it it's not possible to make a javascript function that changes the default information in a text field based on what the user selected in a drop down? (Also I understand there would be a TON of manual entry for that much information for a bunch of movies.) But i can't wrap my mind around php.. T_T otherwise I would just connect it to a database and get the information that way.
you need a way to associate your additional text with the value of the dropdown. Where are you thinking of storing all that data to push into the field? You *could* write each case by hand: $("#myselect").change(function(){ $val = $("#myselect").val(); if($val == "Seabiscuit"){ $("#genre").val("Drama"); $("#director").val("Whoever"); } else if ($val == "Se7en"){ $("#genre").val("Suspense"); $("#director").val("Whoever"); } }); You can quickly see how much time it's going to take you to type all of that out. And then what happens when you need to add another hundred movies? :) Check out this example from w3 schools. It's pretty much how I would approach it, but I would write a script to take the return value of the AJAX request and replace the form values like my previous example: http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ajax_xml.asp edit: syntax
var movie_info = { "seabiscuit":{ "title":"Seabiscuit", "genre":"Drama", "director":"Whoever" }, "se7en": { "title":"Se7en", ... } } this way you can get an object, and reference it easily... a la movie_info["seabiscuit"].title, etc
Hmm. That kind of makes sense. Haha. Thanks.
Gah, I wish I understood 1/2 of what I saw in that example. It looks pretty close to what i'd like. @_@. I understand having to type it all out would take a while. It's for an assignment and I've only got like 20 movies.. so it's not something I would mind. :) Not exactly trying to be the most efficent - just want it to work. 
I think the biggest win is that you can progress a language and have it run across all the browsers without having to get international bodies and vendors together and agonize over features, and then wait another 8 years for the older browsers to phase out. From the ease of use argument, it makes sense when you do the prototypical design patterns over the functional closure styles. When you rely on the `this` object frequently you make your code really violate the spirit of separation of concerns with respect to encapsulation, because you must always be interested in where you are coming from and where you are going, due to the nature of the references. But I agree with you ... I do mostly functional style and I find it graceful and fantastic; However, once I build a big enough project, I end up putting a ["runtime" at the top](https://github.com/kristopolous/EvDa/blob/master/evda.js) or requiring a number of dependencies. With this you don't have to worry about "bootstrapping" the language like this to get the convenience. 
The one thing people don't seem to be mentioning is that *also* it is good practice to run all your code in an anonymous function anyway so you don't create global variables. Also, "barely readable" is something I think you are exaggerating. It is one line at the top of your file, and one at the bottom.
SproutCore 2, now known as [Ember.js](http://www.emberjs.com/), is looking pretty sweet. I've only used Backbone.js so far.
&gt; IE 8 if a user has X number of things could be down right nightmarish. Really, no more nightmarish than that of regular javascript. For the most part, the Coffeescript-&gt;javascript interpretation is really dead simple. The only real exception is the class structure. This is even further made a non-issue if you use an uglifier of any sort.
The debugging issue is not an issue. We use coffeescript for all our javascript at work, and it's trivial to look at where the error occurred in the javascript and find the same place in the coffeescript.
.NET isn't that bad. It has a lot of great features that make programming complex systems a snap. (and yes, I do enjoy programming in Ruby)
Thanks~ I've had this happen to me before, thankfully it was nothing malicious! Compressed scripts are a nightmare to figure out. 
Does it not require you to read and understand the generated Javascript anyway, thus negating the "you don't need to understand the generated Javascript" benefit of using Coffeescript? I ask as an experienced Javascript coder who hasn't tried Coffeescript at this stage.
Came to add [Rhino.](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/) It's a javascript engine written in Java, it integrates nicely with ANT and Maven.
Yes. However, I never saw not needing to understand the generated javascript as a benefit. Not having to write it is the benefit as I see it. Anyone using a meta-language should understand the language it's compiling to to some degree, imo. Coffeescript is attractive as a language to me because I can code it a lot faster. Once I spent my first few hours writing CoffeeScript, I was amazed how much time I spent typing syntax ( {}, [], (), etc. ) when coding pure JavaScript. I agree with ctrldavid that it's trivial to do the translation on the fly if you know JavaScript and spend a few minutes understanding how CS compiles to JS.
I've never seen it claimed that you don't need to understand the generated javascript, and I do understand it so that kinda affects my objectivity here... But there is a fairly consistent 1:1 mapping between the generated JS and the CS source. Stepping through the JS in a debugger will show you where the logic is going wrong regardless, assuming you have a reasonable understanding of how JS works. The variables all have the same name, and the program flow is the same.
I'm not saying verbose syntax is a *good thing*, but I feel like if you're thinking "I could write more code if only I could type it out faster!", then you're not spending enough time thinking about what you're typing.
Oh god the entire thing is in `window.onload = function()`
You're making assumptions about what I'm thinking. When you've already thought about how the code needs to be written, typing a bunch of syntax slows the brain dump. The less time between thought in head and code on screen, the less chance there is to lose the idea you just thought out. Wasting brain cycles thinking about typing syntax is a further distraction that can only serve to put your mind farther from that idea.
I think these are the reasons why I'd use that pattern, * Avoid naming collision, $ is a pretty convenient or short variable name to wrap your library on, on the off-chance that another library overwrites it, you can still use it on a local scope without trying to figure out a way to fix it * Performance, since $ is set on the global scope and it'll probably be accessed a lot of time, storing a local reference to it is a good idea since accessing it on a local scope or anywhere on the scope chain is much better than going to the global scope to look for it. Try the following on any browser. var obj = {}; var start = new Date; for (var i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; i++) obj; console.log(new Date - start); (function (obj) { var start = new Date; for (var i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; i++) obj; console.log(new Date - start); })(obj); * Encapsulation (somewhat), I'm not sure if this is generally done or not, but I like being able to implement a class/widget/etc however I want without leaking variables into the global scope, then exposing an interface with whatever functions I want to be accessible The "with" structure is an EMCA standard. Its avoided because its terribly slow (since it can't be optimized at compile-time I believe) and the syntax is generally confusing at a glace. There's a huge writeup somewhere on why using "with" is a bad idea. I can't seem to find it again. You can still declare a class on the global scope if all the reasons mentioned above is not a concern for your use-case, but the benefits of using that pattern far outweighs not using it and I'm sure I'll be using it for awhile.
First, good concept; these types of examples are much needed for people transitioning into using javascript from other languages. But, from a user interface perspective this website needs a redesign. All patterns are hidden away as mystery meat, I can't just see a list and click them. Instead I have to hover over an abstract image and wait for it to expand (while distorting my memory of which item I'm hovering, because icon placement is moving). Then all the links/titles are positioned relative to the original box, so I have to visually scan each line for text I'm looking for. When I finally do click on an example, I have no visual indication of which boxes I've already click on. The concept would work great for an image gallery of sorts, but for a text-driven learning page, I'd ditch it. 
&gt; &gt; What link? The OP link provides no sample code. &gt; The OP link provides the application in the applicable operating mode. If you want a link with sample code then use the "s" parameter on the page address, as in: &gt; &gt; http://prettydiff.com/?m=minify&amp;s=http://prettydiff.com/diffview.js I think we're on different pages here and I won't bother pursuing the original point; I think I have the answer I need. &gt; &gt; As I said, ASI should be part of any JavaScript parser. &gt; A minifier is not a parser. If code is missing semicolons, such as reliant upon ASI from a parser, and is then minified without ASI the code will be broken. If I give your "minifier" correct JavaScript, I should get correct JavaScript in return. While this does not mean a JavaScript parser is required, it most often is a prerequisite for useful minificiation techniques (like variable renaming (see below)). &gt; &gt; But you seem to be selling it as a product/service. &gt; I am not selling anything. The tool is free to use or download without my consent. I meant to say advertising. &gt; &gt; Also, the JSMin minifier on your website doesn't seem to work. &gt; Do you have a code sample that fails? I have changed the default language detection since your first post. Perhaps you should use the link provided, refresh the page, and try again. Then if you are still having problems please provide a code sample and I will be happy to diagnose the problem. It seems to be your language detection code which doesn't realize that valid JavaScript is valid JavaScript. It seems like I need to include a few key words like "var" to get it to play nice. I see this as a bug with the tool. Think of the problem I encountered how you want. &gt; &gt; Dead code is not eliminated. &gt; That is the role of an obfuscator and not a minifier. A whitespace eliminator is not a minifier; it's a tool useless in the current state-of-the-art of JavaScript language tools (which I argue have been production-ready for at least a year). Unless there's something special to offer (like tinyc does for C compilers), I find a whitespace eliminator (which you say has not worked on some *valid* JavaScript until now!) worthless. &gt; &gt; Because the Pretty Diff diffing tool claims to understand JavaScript, I expected identical identifiers to be treated as identical. &gt; They are when they are present in a similar context. This is not the case in your prior examples. What is my motivation in crippling my tool to output false negatives? In my [real-world example][1], a JavaScript-aware diffing tool would have detected that the last line (`window['require'] = globalRequire;`) only had the `['` and `']` changed. &gt; &gt; The algorithm you use may be useful for binaries, and maybe compressed JavaScript, but it is detrimental and nearly useless for development. &gt; The algorithm is useful when used on real code. It is potentially worthless when used on largely incomparable hypotheticals. Garbage in results in garbage out. I don't see how the last two examples I provided are "garbage in".

 Shouldn't be using so many globals. Use one namespace only. In addition, seems silly to add resource by constants, how about instead: var r = new RL({images:["a.png","b.png"],audio:["a.mp3","b.mp3"],onComplete:function(d){ console.log("done"); }}) Even better, don't specifiy the type and lookup the extension in your code for the user: var r = new RL({files:["a.png","b.png","a.mp3","b.mp3"],onComplete:function(d){ console.log("done"); }}) .... var images = [], audio=[]; for(var i=0,len=files.length;i&lt;len;i++){ var ext = file[i].substring(file[i].lastIndexOf(".")+1,file[i].length); switch(ext){ case "png": images.push(file); break; case "mp3": audio.push(file); break; } } //load images array //load audio array
No error handling? Just what the web needs... This class doesn't seem to be at all extensible, which is a big concern. It may be a good piece of code to learn from, though, for one way to do async asset management in JavaScript. I personally combine Q (promises) + a custom asset manager (depending upon what the task needs; sprite sheets, parsed XML or JSON, whatever). Promises are great at recursive dependencies (e.g. game level file loads images, sounds, and models, and models may themselves load textures).
Agreed about enums/constants, though I disagree with your way of solving it. I see the API was designed for cases where the entire resource list is not in one place, and building an array manually would be lame. Since you'd be passing the resource manager around anyway, you have addResource methods. I would instead of have addImage, addSound, addJSON, etc. Easy to extend, easy to read, and the API doesn't need to change much. (addImage wouldn't need to waste an argument on content-type, either.)
When YOU modify the Array prototype, you can break other peoples libraries. Like Sharepoint 2010's stuff.
Agreed. Promises are pretty powerful. But depending on the focus of the book, OP's code works too. Like you said, there's many ways to solve this problem.
I have never heard of CS, but after looking at that site I just cannot think of a reason as to why I would use it. I am assuming CS is for beginners, is that correct?, if not then under what conditions would make a competent developer consider using CS?.
I only recently started using it for a game, will be putting a version online fairly soon. (still too buggy atm)
I've shortened the name and started using a property map for CSS calls. Just got stuck on the one for gradients... probably because of quotes or something on the filter property. Not sure yet.
I've lessened the default contrast for the OFF state, which already makes it better. As to integrating something like SteveRyherd's link, this will take more time, as I want to keep the plugin as customizable as possible. But definitely something I will work on. Just have to decide how to do it.
&gt; it most often is a prerequisite for useful minificiation techniques (like variable renaming (see below)). Minifiers do not rename variables. That is obfuscation. An obfuscator will permanently alter the code to achieve the smallest size possible regardless of what happens to the code. Its a one way function like a hash. A minifier performs no such harm to the code. The only harm from a minifier is the removing of comments, because all other changes can be restored with a beautifier or pretty-printer. &gt; A whitespace eliminator is not a minifier; it's a tool useless in the current state-of-the-art of JavaScript language tools (which I argue have been production-ready for at least a year). A minifier is a white space eliminator and comment eliminator. Anything that is recursively harmful to the original authoring of the code is not minification. This is obfuscation. Obfuscators are potentially harmful as obfuscated code is difficult to troubleshoot. This is the primary reason why JavaScript compilers, such as CoffeeScript, are not more popular. &gt; In my real-world example, a JavaScript-aware diffing tool would have detected that the last line (window['require'] = globalRequire;) only had the [' and '] changed. I will just have to take your word for it. If my tool does fit your needs please feel free to fork it and make your own improvements. &gt; I don't see how the last two examples I provided are "garbage in". They are wildly different so as to make an automated comparison less valid. If I can look each of the samples and tell they are wildly different from each other then why would I need an automated to tell me they are wildly different?
&gt; It’s a synchronous version of setTimeout that doesn’t block the main thread. setTimeout is synchronous and the timer part of this is non-blocking. It only becomes blocking at execution time, but you can recursively plan around this with some minimal checks to lessen that blow. The blocking nature, however, is only blocking to the single threaded execution of concurrent operations in a single threaded interpreter and not blocking to execution outside the interpreter, such as asset requests and DOM interpretation. This is true even in IE 6 and IE 7 where JavaScript is blocking to absolutely everything. An example of a code model I use to minimize the blocking nature of the code is as follows: var myFunction = function () { var a = document.getElementById("someNodeID"), b, // scope some variables, but do nothing outside the check c, d; if (a !== null &amp;&amp; typeof a === "object") { // minimal check, quick execution //check passed, so put your actual execution stuff in here. } else { // test fails, so delay this code some more setTimeout(myFunction, 100); } }; setTimeout(myFunction, 100); 
I did some work with iterators/generators to help with "callback spaghetti" a while back: http://matt.bridges.name/archive/54 I can't wait for broader support of iterators/generators, as this only works in Firefox at the moment. 
js-game-frameworks have grown into a formidable jungle, if I may say so myself. A butload of crap. With a few gems. Personally, I found jaws (https://github.com/ippa/jaws) to be pretty helpful. Its fairly lightweight and the codebase is clean. Which for me was one of the main selling points.
GameJs is cool. I've used it in a couple of games, one commercial. GameJs has a whole bunch of useful features for making games. Like A* path finding, some really good Rectangle functions (like seeing if rects collide), pixel perfect collision detection, Matrix, and Vector functionality and a boat load of other things that are useful in most games. GameJs makes things easy, and uses a proven&amp;simple API that works for lots of different types of games. http://gamejs.org/
 var tmp = obj.foo; obj.foo = obj.bar; obj.bar = munge(tmp); &gt; What happens if munge does a yield and only resumes your code after a few other events fire? Those events could interact with obj, and they’d see it in this intermediate state where both obj.foo and obj.bar are the same value, because obj.bar hasn’t yet been updated. This is not "something as simple as swapping a couple of fields of an object", the function call sticks out like dog's bollocks. It asks, "what is `munge`?", at which point my eye wanders up the enclosing lexical scope and finds it. It does the same for `obj` and immediately observes whether the two values have anything to do with each other. If there is any dependence, it is trivially statically resolvable. This argument holds no water. 
That's weird, they've been working fine for me. I've been using [StratifiedJS](http://onilabs.com/stratifiedjs) for about a year now with great success.
Cool, do you have a link to a game you made using it?
I see your point about minifiers. I use a different term for what you describe ("whitespace eliminator", or "compressor"); a minifier (by my definition) should try its best to reduce the code size without changing the behaviour of the running code. The operation is not lossless. &gt; Obfuscators are potentially harmful as obfuscated code is difficult to troubleshoot. This is the primary reason why JavaScript compilers, such as CoffeeScript, are not more popular. Minifiers (by my definition) are firstly intended to reduce transport size, and sometimes reduce compilation and execution time (through dead code elimination and constant folding, for example). Obfuscators intentionally try to trick engineers looking at code as to not reveal actual intent (company secrets, etc.). Given this, I don't see what your tools and obfuscators have to do with JavaScript compilers like CoffeeScript. &gt; &gt; I don't see how the last two examples I provided are "garbage in". &gt; They are wildly different so as to make an automated comparison less valid. If I can look each of the samples and tell they are wildly different from each other then why would I need an automated to tell me they are wildly different? Inserting a line of code and making a small modification to another now makes the two "wildly different"? =\ // Before var x = 'hello world'.slice(2); // After var y = 'testing'; var x = 'hello world'.slice(1); Diff: http://i.imgur.com/POfK1.png A good example, which is just a rename and a swap of two lines: // Before function fitRectangleScale(containerW, containerH, innerW, innerH) { var containerAR = containerW / containerH; var innerAR = innerW / innerH; var ratio = innerAR; var target_ratio = containerAR; if (ratio &gt; target_ratio) { return containerW / ratio / innerH; } else { return containerH * ratio / innerW; } } // After function fitRectangleScale(containerW, containerH, innerW, innerH) { var containerAR = containerW / containerH; var innerAR = innerW / innerH; var targetRatio = containerAR; var ratio = innerAR; if (ratio &gt; targetRatio) { return containerW / ratio / innerH; } else { return containerH * ratio / innerW; } } Diff: http://i.imgur.com/4GRaX.png Your tool works well with simple variable renames where nothing else changes. But so are many line diff tools, so I see little need for your tool in its current state. If the diffing tool dramatically changes, let me know and I'd love to take a look at it. But right now the diffing and minification tools are nearly useless. 
That's why I said "if it doesn't already exist".
I have no direct links to tutorials but here is my 2 cents worth of advice: Learn how objects/prototypes/inheritance work in javascript. Learn JSON (javascript object notation). Understand Object Oriented Programming and design patterns. Look at the examples that come with ExtJS (they have quite a few). Check out the source code to Feng Office (it's based off PHP and ExtJS and fairly well structured). Check out any existing code from your employer and figure out how they're doing things currently.

I write JS all day. I'm on a team of about 10 very elite JS engineers including Dojo and Node core contributors and that's just at work. I think that syntax is indeed nice, but it's not what "most" JS devs are doing at all. If anything, most are just doing var foo = "bar"; var hello = "world"; ... Maybe I'm completely out of touch with the community standards tho, so could you point me to some large projects that use that syntax of declaring vars?
hmm it didn't read my returns? Those var declarations were supposed to be 1 per line...
I can't give this enough likes!
