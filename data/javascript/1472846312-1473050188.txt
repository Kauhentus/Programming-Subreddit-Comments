&gt; had settled on an understanding that declarative is an abstraction on top of imperative functions, and no matter what, at some level it's imperative. In JS, yes because the VM likes imperative more. in a real functional language like elixir, erlang, haskell, etc its not the case.

If I wanted to sell a fuel-injector, I'd suggest [aynchronous generator functions](https://davidwalsh.name/async-generators) =) 
People commenting here and on twitter seem to want to make this about the so-called PC Police winning another round in the name of 'inclusiveness.' But it seems like the actual reason is because he's a jerk?
Can you post an example using one of these APIs? In your code you have `if(true) { // Async task`. If you replace that with a call to whatever library you want to use, you still call `resolve()` or `reject()`.
&gt; Link with the full text of what Crockford said That doesn't appear to even be referring to the same conference.
In that case, just quietly stop inviting him. However, in this case a person publicly requested for him to be removed in a passive-aggressive fashion. Also, in this case, when they asked if anyone had suggestions for reaching out to more keynotes, the first reply they got was "I'd really like to see a non-cis and/or non-white keynote. That'd be lovely." Their response to that was "that would be awesome!" From this and other things such as complaints about Doug making a joke about weak maps not being masculine, I can confidently assume that this is, in fact, about being politically correct.
He gave a talk at google once, titled "Monads and Gonads" and... well... safe spaces... trigger warnings...
this: http://archive.is/JuAYd FFS. Merit and ideas are secondary to sensitivity and feelings.
Haha. Well, that sums it up nicely.
The part after that, the actual reason is a way better explanation why this is childish nonsense. He/She/It is just pissed about a snarky comment from crockford that probably wasnt even meant to shoot at her.
I would love to see Doug speak again. He's a pillar of the community.
Yep: what async gives you is a special scope in which it's possible to pause the execution of lines inside that scope until values are available. This allows you to write code in a sequential fashion similar to synchronous code. Inside that scope, awaiting async values is blocking (i.e. nothing else can happen): outside that scope, the overall application is not blocked. But also external to that scope (external to the async function) the function is still able to return, at best, a promise.
Sure is salty in here.
Sure does explain a lot......
Multiple tracks, sure whatever. But I go to conferences for the tech, not to indulge in made up social issues
I understand your logic and makes sense to me also. [Rauschma's comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/50v8ky/function_vs_function/d777ye6) that `(fn)()` sintax works in arrow functions and not `(fn())` is interesting though.
And Tumblr.
I remember watching that talk on a live stream. He said that weak maps was one of his favourite new features and said that he was worried that programmers would overlook it because the name didn't seem very masculine, probably jokingly. He was 'called out' by some of the people commenting on twitter and they ended up editing that part out of the video before it was uploaded to Youtube.
&gt; ~~sad pee-stained losers~~ people whose freely-donated time and expertise our business happily takes advantage of
Be that as it may, are his talks informative and/or entertaining?
From our slack channel at work, though I have no further context to provide at the moment: &gt;the full context is that Crockford refers to the old web model as promiscuous and his proposed model as commitment. By placing promiscuity in a negative light, Crockford slut shamed the audience. edit: Here's confirmation: https://twitter.com/ag_dubs/status/666026590774673408 https://twitter.com/nebrius/status/697491096926945281

Pathetic
I recognize her. [She commented on the Opal library thing too.](https://github.com/opal/opal/issues/941#issuecomment-113272419) Veeery interesting.

That's the one downside to the simplicity of JS. Even those who waste their mental faculties on SJW crusades can still write effective JavaScript :(
Well, since the bit was removed there's no way to be sure. I could have misheard, you know.
Like JSLint. amirite!?
Stole my answer. +1 to this, based on my coworkers.
But wanting inclusion is not the same as wanting exclusion, so it is not a double standard to want one and not the other. 
or richard stallman.
As stated, that's not "wanting inclusion". It's literally wanting exclusion. &gt; I'd really like to see a non-transgender and/or non-black keynote Same exact format as stated by that Twitter user, but substituted with a different "gender" and race. How long do you think a statement like that would go on Twitter before it was shit all over by exactly the same people who have said this: &gt; I'd really like to see a non-cis and/or non-white keynote Discrimination is discrimination.
Oh so you're to blame for React huh? ;) Edit: Ooh touchy bunch aren't we? :) 
No, Brendan Eich is a homophobe.
That is childish and I would hope any conference tasked with choosing between Kas or Douglas that they would choose Douglas. Because if there's something I don't want in my life, it's a whiney adult child who can't handle conversations with functional people giving a talk at a conference I enjoy.
&gt;Update: I’ve switched comments to ‘not visible.’ I won’t be reading them. I don’t feel the need to justify this, either. Thanks ❤. Oh, what a surprise. Typical hypocritical attitude of these types; constantly looking for something to take offense at so they can criticize others, but refusing to accept any criticism towards themselves. Also: &gt;So I don’t like naming and shaming. Bullshit.
Ha, doubt it. It reminds me of what happened to Ben Noordhuis, one of the most prolific contributors to Node. After he [declined to merge a PR](https://github.com/joyent/libuv/pull/1015) that removed a gendered comment from libuv, he was publicly shamed by hordes of (non-contributing) GitHub commenters and even Joyent. Bryan Cantrill went as far as [calling him an asshole and saying he'd fire him if he could](https://www.joyent.com/blog/the-power-of-a-pronoun). To the best of my knowledge, this was all without private discussion, and before Ben could give a rationale for why he'd declined it in the first place. (Spoiler alert: there were plenty of good reasons.) Ignore that Ben volunteers his IRL time helping young girls learn to program; he's a misogynist for declining a PR that would have provided no material benefit to women in tech, but would have been a pain in the ass for actual contributors deal with. 
There is no way. It just cannot be. *This* is the slut shaming incident?
So accurate 
yes, any programming language will teach you skills that transfer to any other coding language, things like looping constructs, functions, procedures, etc .... its always the most difficult learning your first programming language, because no only are you learning syntax and conventions, and ecosystems, etc, but you are learning programming concepts and techniques for the first time... after learning one language really well, its not unreasonable to expect to able to learn to be useful with any language over the course of a weekend 
The only way you could come to that conclusion is by ignoring the fact that tech is dominated by white males.
I don't know what else to say, this is the answer you are looking for, just look for other guides on it. 
But white males are already included, to the exclusion of basically all others. To want a higher representation of non-white non-male speakers is not the same as wanting to exclude white males. Simply doing a find and replace on the sentence doesn't take into account any of the context and leads to an intentional misreading.
[shrinkpack](https://github.com/JamieMason/shrinkpack) will work around this for you, but I also recently heard that this is being [fixed very soon in npm](https://twitter.com/othiym23/status/771792536675295232).
Could be... It was a pure JS conf. 
https://twitter.com/ag_dubs/status/666026590774673408 https://twitter.com/nebrius/status/697491096926945281
Such utter wishy-washy bollocks.
&gt; She commented on the Opal library thing too. Holy shit. I'm really afraid to have a popular OS project because of shit like that. That's scary man. 
That was it. That said, we don't know what tone he said it in or how he phrased it, or if anyone confronted him about it, or how he reacted if they did. But I think we can safely say that was it, given it's a direct reference to (A) Crockford (B) 'slut shaming' (C) ForwardJS and (D) said event being directed towards the audience as a whole, which are all mentioned by the Medium post. 
When sandboxing an eval command for an IRC bot, I used a combination of safe-eval from NPM and JSBin's loopProtect.
Thanks for the help. I actaully made some progress. I am going to use https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/quickstart/js and figure out how to compare date of event with "todays date". if === display on board, else do not display or maybe have a coming up section. 
I think generators are indeed a de-opt in most if not all JS engines at the moment. However, you can get around this somewhat. If you need a tight, optimized loop in a generator, or some other chunk of optimized code, you can place it inside another, separate non-generator function and call it from within the generator. It will be optimized as usual by the underlying JS engine. In any case, having yield-able semantics inside a chunk of code that should be highly optimized seems like it could be a code smell.
Clicked for the examples. Left very disappointed in the few provided. The same thing happened at the reason rally. Now I'm angry, I don't understand the "toxicity" towards the conveyance of language, especially in an adult setting. The whole point of an adult setting is that you're not limited in your language, thereby increasing the effectiveness of communication. It also allows for terrible jokes, and god damn do whites need more trash in their lives.
It's like a Tumblr blog speech.
Right, it's more representative of what's happening, and it translates better to other areas of JavaScript. Like making a call like so: ({ a: 1 }).a actually works where ({ a: 1 }.a) does not.
Learning JS is easier if you already know some C-like language. But in general, "learn X in 21 days" is complete bullshit. It takes much longer than that - especially if you start from zero.
Around the 6th drink...hmm, JavaScript could really use another library.
They would rather a non white present. Isn't that excluding whites? Plus, if they aren't racist/sexist, why does it matter? Are they saying they don't like him because of his skin color and sex? I see what you're getting at, but it is including one section by excluding another. Exactly the same, just with a minority group.
Thanks a lot. Look into that in detail
Maybe, JS is the new hot language and used for web. It tends to attract the type of people that find these subjects important.
Eh? Haven't heard that yet
****applause****
&gt; “mmm.” I replied. Solid feedback.
No, not fired. He resigned.
Humongous what? HUMONGOUS WHAT!?
I don't remember having to pass a white exam to get into tech.
Her talk at Nodevember last year put a lot of people on blast. The entire talk was about shaming people. It was very uncomfortable and in no way related to what I _thought_ I was walking into (a community development talk). I highly recommend watching the presentation on YouTube.. She and OP (from the tweet) are exactly what she's complaining about. It's so frustrating and sad. I feel so awful for the conference organizers. 
Drama as a github issue. Neat.
Only louder and more frustrating. 
ruby has the same kind of people b/c of rails ha, too bad i love the web :p
He is SUPER eccentric. He once gave a talk about the history of toilets and somehow tied that into JS. Also a different talk where he showed a 25 minute clip in its entirety about the planning of the Disney Epcot center.
Thanks, but unfortunately neither of those are any better. safe-eval is a VM-based solution running in node (rather than the browser) and loopProtect modifies the JS that will be run, which effectively invalidates the benchmark, since you're no longer testing the user code but the user code + loop breaking.
From the link: “we do not need to choose between good people and good code; if we foster a good community, good code will follow.” Still trying to fathom this and the thought behind it. Good code comes from good people and bad code comes from bad people? Not clear on this persons definition of "good people" seems to be arbitrary.
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH PLACING PROMISCUITY IN A NEGATIVE LIGHT? fucking morons! ahh!!!
for comparison, here's Crockford's keynote. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir4n_t5p170 Starting it off with a line about hot chicks. /s edit: /s so u know
Is there a function difference here? 
Crockford grew up in a time when women could only show their ankles.
Yup, everything in her presentation was just as expected, even down to the language where she's clarifying between "cis-passing" and "cis-gender". If she's invited to present at any future conferences, count me out.
I thought I knew javascript until I worked on a pure javascript page. I read 12 js books in a week, then I was good to go.
If a particular institution condemns your relationship, maybe you should look elsewhere if you want to make it official. What gives you the right to force representatives of a religion to perform one of their sacraments for a couple that violates their faith? Why would you even *want* that? If there is no suitable alternative, maybe *that* is the real problem.
I will add: git If seeking full-stack: REST architecture SQL + relational databases Having another server side language under your belt, if not familiar with node, will be useful, but not totally necessary. As always, the most important aspect is to have a working, polished portfolio of interesting projects.
Everyone says so.
Pycon and now this is the reason why I stay away from confs outside my local area.
&gt; Prototypes are stupid and if you like them you're stupid too! This.
Well, here's a pretty hacked around example: https://github.com/jakehamilton/patch-example
&gt; Sounds like a harmless joke to me. This tells me that they take offense where there is none. Then they go and start requesting that he is uninvited, an action made to just start drama and anger. This was my reaction as well. I find it hard to believe that people were actually offended by the comments Crockford made. I think it's much more likely that they took what he said as an opportunity to get attention, and didn't think about the consequences (defaming a pioneer in the very community they are supposedly celebrating).
Look at vue.js it's like a gateway framework. It uses some stuff from Angular and React. It's pretty easy to pick up because you don't need a build environment or anything. 
&gt; In a tweet from one of the "offended", they said: "Did Doug Crockford seriously just say on stage that no one wants to use weak maps because weak isn't masculine? What? I don't even..." I just literally watched the video ([statement right here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhV6hlL_wMc#t=15m15s)), he didn't even mention masculinity; he says "nobody wants to put anything weak in their program, right?" and does a weak little arm flex... She really had to make some assumptions there in order to get the full offense she was looking for.
The _app_ in question WeakMaps, which are a language feature in ES2015.
Donating a thousand dollars is more than an opinion, it's tangible support for denying certain people their rights. His opinion is irrelevant, as is ascribing labels. He spoke with his actions.
He'll speak again, at conferences worth going to.
apparently it's "edited"
I purposely watched for any kind of evidence of editing and didn't see any. But maybe.
Hot chicken is a popular food in Nashville where Nodevember takes place. Source: Live in Nashville. Ate hot chicken for lunch.
&gt; WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH PLACING ~~PROMISCUITY~~ GAMING IN A NEGATIVE LIGHT? 
&gt; https://medium.com/@nodebotanist/why-i-won-t-be-speaking-at-conferences-with-douglas-crockford-anymore-61bc29f028c8#.5da3ctvx3 ahem https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1472862267&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=javascript+the+good+parts
While this may or may not apply to Crockford, it certainly applies to people in favour of excluding him.
... say what now? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non_sequitur_(logic)
Why doesn't the Nodevember [website](http://nodevember.org/) list any of their speakers or sponsors, yet have tickets readily available for $350. 
No he didn't. He'd be like 100.
As another perspective, I work with pretty a few pretty abrasive, emotionally immature dudes. Possible Aspergers or near the spectrum. Lacking in the graces that would keep them from being call misanthropic know-it-all nerds. And you know what? I try to include them, to be kind and accepting. Because that's the appropriate response. Kindness. Not excluding and publicly announcing how awful they are, and to keep them away from me. And yet, I do vocally push back on their behavior sometimes, as appropriate. It's that kind of response that sucks about this story, while bandying around words like safe-space or "ally" these people or more than willing to toss anyone under the treads if they don't conform to their "ultra-progressive" view on gender, sex-positivity, etc. I don't like it at all. 
No evidence, just an angry anecdote. Try again. Qualifications aren't required to refute the statement given, it's unbiased evidence we need. How can smart people not realize this I never understand.
If you're in charge quantify the technical debt amassed with switching to react from jquery and set a dollar amount to it, create a presentation and present it. If it's worth it and it makes them money they'll bite. Try and figure in training/consulting into the figures to be fair.
Is that sexual harassment?!
&gt; it's debatable enough calling an overtly homophobic or bigoted speaker a word like "unsafe" This really bothers me. A reasonable person shouldn't feel "unsafe" unless someone makes a credible threat. This kind of exaggeration is just fear-mongering in order to justify an overreaction to offensive or ignorant statements. And IMHO, equating language with violence downplays actual violence. 
Well women make me uncomfortable. So they'll all have to leave too. 
I was in a slack channel when this was being discussed by some of the people running Nodevember. I copied out the text, but I'm not sure if a) - anyone is interested in reading through it, and b) - if I'm even allowed to post something like that here. I should clarify that it's not the slack channel where they discussed it and decided to do it, but it's a slack channel where there was more open, heated discussion where some of the Nodevember staff were participating. I live in that area, and I'm afraid to speak my mind because it seems so much of the development community in Nashville leans heavily toward the left and PC culture, and I don't want to end up being excluded from a future position due to my personal beliefs which have nothing to do with software engineering.
The person attaching him is a node dev at salesforce one at Microsoft and many work at npm itself.
Sometimes I wonder if these people are serious or if they're just looking for drama and their moment of internet fame
Create an html file with the basic tags, and add your code between &lt;script&gt; tags. Open the html file in the browser. 
now you know why people make fun of js devs
this isn't progressive though, it's regressive.
Since Crockford is topical today... he once said he hated `(function () { ... })();` because it "**looks like dogballs**".
eh i don't think so anymore. id give that title to Kyle Simpson. i always found his opinion to just avoid "bad parts" of JS misguided. Kyle on the other hands tells us to *understand* all parts and make smart decisions as to which are bad or good.
That is false.
Don't code shame me.
No node for me. I will boycott any product that is way too PC until sanity returns.
You sir/madam have no class
I don't have a great answer for you, sorry; but I too would like to know...
Marriage wasn't considered a right. Most states had laws. And still do have laws dictating who can and can't get married. First cousins and siblings are barred from marrying one another. Their rights aren't generally accepted to be violated by doing so. Polyamorus people are still denied their right to marry a choosing. I disagree with Eich's position. But I don't think this alone makes him incapable of empathizeing or working ethically with gays. 
I swear something like this happened before, some high profile SJW witch hunt about something related to a conference, where they demanded someone be uninvited. The person was uninvited, and the organizers used the same completely retarded excuse about how 'you can't please everyone'.
Safe space.
She's cancer.
To use the SJW terminology, excluding him is bullying. They don't like what he represents or can contribute, good, bad or indifferent, all they know is that they are not as revered as he is and thus they manipulate as many people as possible; punching, twisting arms, pulling hair, and somehow end up playing the victim card and getting their victim into trouble, or in a time out, for appropriately responding to hostility. We all know what is going on, we may not be able to articulate it so the world understands, these things are always shrouded in obscure, intimate details and or jargon of special events and circumstances that make it irrelevant to the layman and make whoever pouts the most get the sympathy and the other get reprimanded. I think we all get the point of those saying that in a professional environment you will have to deal with these kinds of SJW as well as crotchety old people set in their ways. The point isn't to bend over and take it, the point is; Welcome to the real world, now grow the fuck up. Everyone is not your friend. Your efforts are entirely narcissistic, making everything about you. Guess what buttercup, jack shit is about you. You are a moron, you are not special, that thing you just though up was thought up 10 years ago and shot down, probably by Douglas Crockford, so how about you come up with some substantive reasoning and logic about your shitty ideas and present them in a convincing and unambiguous way that gets the community talking about your ideas, his ideas, someone's ideas instead of how your prissy ass was uncomfortable while you stroked your participation trophy.

Be careful not to conflate phobia -- unreasonable fear -- with dislike or disagreement. Attempting to describe a person based on **your** idea of their thought process is far more dangerous to society than somebody who believes that homosexuality is not beneficial to the species as a whole. For example. 
## A micro-aggressive wordlist to avoid at safe-spaces. In order to achieve inclusive conferences it's high time to create a standard to exclude the use of these micro-aggressive words. By avoiding the use of these words we can create safe spaces for everybody. I've only begun with [a starter list of words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_common_words_in_English), but there are many more out there. By defining these words and why they are wrong, hopefully others will educate themselves. nouns: time: example: "Do you know the time of the event?" reason: Could imply you know the time, but the other person is an idiot for not knowing person: example: "What's that persons name?" reason: Is insensitive to people that don't identify as people. year: example: "What year was javascript born?" reason: Year's, especially those in the past, bring acute self awareness to the limited life of humans. way: example: "This way" reason: Note the forcefulness. This is abusive and is liken to slavery where people don't have a choice. day: example: "It's in the day" reason: Note the exclusion of the night. thing: example: "This thing is dope" reason: It's important to not refer to anything as thing. Things aren't cuddly man: example: "That man gave me flowers" reason: Men silence women by being men. They're also, by nature, aggressive. world: example: "What in the world?" reason: This excludes other planets AND extraterrestrials. This is important and use of this word will lead to our demise. life: example: "I love life" reason: This is a very aggressive pro-life stance that excludes those who are pro-death. I mean abortion. hand: example: "Give me a hand" reason: Very triggering for those with traumatic experiences of those who lost their hands. part: example: "I'll do my part" reason: A part isn't whole and so is exclusive to the rest of the parts. child: example: "Can I bring my child?" reason: Children are by definition below the age of majority, so they are a minority. Will you think of the children? eye: example: "I have my eye on that" reason: Eyes connect to our brains and are the precursor of prejaduce in less than 1000ms. The mention of eyes implies that. woman: example: "We're looking for a woman" reason: Some people don't identify as a woman. It's important to preemptively know who somebody idenfies as. place: example: "What place is it?" reason: Place is a portion of space designated for someone or a group of people. Group implies theres others outside of the group. work: example: "I have some work for you" reason: Work often involves mental, physical effort and has been shown to stress people out. week: example: "Can I get this done this week?" reason: This isn't so bad, but it can be misheard as weak. case: example: "Do you have a case?" reason: A case is an instance of a particular situation. It's important to not use the word case without forwarning for people that can't handle situations point: example: "What's the point?" reason: A tapered, sharp end of a tool. Points are naturally aggressive. government: example: "I work for the government" reason: Government is the subjectation of people. company: example: "What company do you work for?" reason: You should never allow anyone to define you by the company you work for. number: example: "What number is the mathematical constant of pi?" reason: A number is a quantity or amount. Again, this falls under quantifiying things. Numbers should never be defined. group: example: "I'm part of the 5am group" reason: Not everyone can be part of a group. Furthermore, this implies superiority problem: example: "I have a problem with these examples" reason: By having a problem with something, you actually have a problem with that person. It's important to keep your comments to yourself. fact: example: "These are the facts I've gathered" reason: Though facts are indisputable, they don't take into consideration the feelings of anyone. Facts should never be used.
a) yes and b) yes.
React brings encapsulation, reusability, performance, and a strong community. When comparing to jquery, it's not a fair comparison. I come from a jquery background and have been using React for more than a year now. React is by far a better choice.
Don't fret. Just close issues like that with extreme prejudice.
This approaches syntactic line noise and we're all going to suffer for it eventually.
I'm inclined to agree.
I'm not familiar with the PyCon incident. Can you link to a summary somewhere?
Best part is when someone *who wasn't even going to go in the first place* gets a speaker removed.
Way too many characters to fit here. http://pastebin.com/3mQc7DfG It's a public slack, so I didn't remove/change anyone's names.
Thank you, yes - finding resources on recursion was simple enough. It took some work but I got all the way down the evolves_to property with hasOwnProperty but my problem has become now dealing with edge cases that don't follow the typical model of 3 evolution objects each nested within each other. So for Bulbasaur I just need to get pokemon.evolves_to[0].evolves_to[0] but then Eevee would be something like pokemon.evolves_to[0] pokemon.evolves_to[1] pokemon.evolves_to[2] pokemon.evolves_to[3] etc... I guess I'm just having trouble figuring out how to handle both eevee and bulbsaur but as I type this I'm getting an idea... I guess maybe I just need to abstract it into two (or more) separate functions like getRegularPokemon(){...buildRegularObject...} and then something like getEevee(){ ... if search is eevee then build this object instead of buildRegularObject...} and create others as I need for edge cases? Can anyone comment? 
What's an SJW?
Speaking of comfort, how comfortable can a conference possibly be that got overrun by SJWs who, if you dare say a word or make a joke, will twist what you say to make you a bad person and then shame you on social media. They're creating an environment where people are afraid to say anything for fear of being misrepresented and bullied.
&gt; especially in an adult setting amen
True. And that's the very definition of an uncomfortable space right there.
not a single example. just a bunch of vague crap
Cancer
I think he likes to say he "discovered it" rather :)
meh was being extremely patient. he could have just closed it and said thank you we'll take it under consideration. or just closed it without a word.
&gt; even as a man debatable, you sound like a fruitcake
You tangentially raise a good point. Is this what happens when the language you work in becomes the most popular? People stop evangelizing and focusing on the cool shit, and instead start trying to clan off and bitch about one another?
Don't know why this was downvoted, it's a good point.
I took the object inside of the "chain" property of your bulbasaur and assigned that to the variable bulb. I assigned your eevee, unchanged, to eevee then ran them both through this function: function showPokemon (pokemon) { console.log(pokemon.species.name); if(pokemon.hasOwnProperty('evolves_to')) { pokemon.evolves_to.forEach(showPokemon) } } The result was: showPokemon(bulb) VM757:2 bulbasaur VM757:2 ivysaur VM757:2 venusaur undefined showPokemon(eevee) VM757:2 eevee VM757:2 vaporeon VM757:2 jolteon VM757:2 flareon VM757:2 espeon VM757:2 umbreon VM757:2 leafeon VM757:2 glaceon VM757:2 sylveon As you can see you don't need to deal with indices at all if you can find the right recursive method.
Agree to disagree. You'll notice most of the people doing the complaining don't do much programming. They tend to be HR, sales, developer outreach or write documentation. Called it! The complainer is the Lead Developer Evangelist at Salesforce.
Truth of the matter is communist vs. far right is coming to every corner of our lives. Unfortunately if you're a white male, you're pressured to pick a side. On the one side you have the folks that don't like you for your skin color because for the past 50+ years the school systems have been invaded by communists preaching the evils of "whiteness" and on the other side you have the folks that don't want race mixing. That's where the world is at now. Someone's playing a nice game of divide and conquer. 
That's true. I was incorrect. He did resign, however, there was massive public outcry calling for his head: https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/04/05/faq-on-ceo-resignation/
Neither. Javascript sucks ass!
Holy crap! Yes, I have much to learn. I guess I'm going to read everything I can find on recursion... thanks!
this didnt happen to java, c++, etc. its just a thing with dynamic web languages that are easy to get into
I keep a big list of links to high-quality articles and tutorials on React, at https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links . In that list, the categories for ["Thinking in React"](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links/blob/master/thinking-in-react-and-flux.md) and ["Pros, Cons, and Discussion"](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links/blob/master/pros-cons-discussion.md) have a number of resources you may find useful. The presentation ["Relieving Backbone Pain with Flux and React"](http://product.hubspot.com/blog/moving-backbone-to-flux-react) is also a great overview of why React is usually a better approach.
There's a little exaggeration there. You don't really need to know HTML unless you are maintaining a legacy app.
the IDE doesnt matter at all delete is a reserved word, but you are not using "delete" you are using: app.delete which is the delete method of the app object, so that doesnt matter. are you sure you are using the DELETE http verb when you hit that /dishes route? (im assuming this is an express-like web framework that you are using) try changing it to: app.delete('/dishes', function(req, res, next){ console.log(req.method); res.end('Deleting all dishes'); }); and then check in your node console to see if the console.log is being triggered, and if the http method is logged as DELETE We will need more context (more code and information about what is consuming the code as well) to be able to really offer any help.
Here's something I threw together real quick: https://jsfiddle.net/19qdL33s/ and https://jsfiddle.net/sL3enhxp/ Basically all I did was take this example of how to use d3 to visualize a tree: http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/8324872 and then run your pokemon through a converter I wrote to get it into the right form because the d3 tree wants a name (species.name) and children (evolves_to) property: function convertToD3(pokemon) { pokemon.name = pokemon.species.name; pokemon.children = pokemon.evolves_to.length &gt; 0 ? pokemon.evolves_to : null; if (pokemon.hasOwnProperty('evolves_to')) { pokemon.children = pokemon.evolves_to.length &gt; 0 ? pokemon.evolves_to : null; pokemon.evolves_to.forEach(convertToD3) } else { pokemon.children = null; } } That converter mutates the original object which isn't ideal, but deep copying is a whole problem unto itself and in this case the conversion only adds properties. EDIT: convertToD3 is messy. It doesn't need the pokemon.children = at the top, the same assignment inside of the if is sufficient.

&gt;Do consider that marriage conveys important rights - it's not just a glossy certificate. People who aren't given marriage rights when they want to be a couple will have great difficulty sorting stuff out when a partner dies or gets very ill etc Oh, I consider that by all means. But consider that Brendan Eich may not have considered it when forming his initial opinion. He may not have realized that was even a factor.
this doesnt make sense AT ALL You are already willing to use the result of the SELECT inside of the same function that calls the select, you ARE using callback mechanism right now, but you are fighting super hard to do it without using a callback.... just put the code you want to use with the result, into a function that you pass as the callback. Its really not that hard, you just need to stop fighting to make it harder, and take a few minutes to learn how to do it the right way, once you realize how easy it is, you will probably be embarrassed of what you are currently trying to do.
I'm a "gg'er?" Can you please substantiate your claim?
Javascript wasn't always good enough to be the only browser language even. 10 years ago much of what people viewed in their browser was written in Flash, Java Applets and Active-X. Crockford's active promotion of javascript as a "real programming language" is what allowed companies like apple to confidently kill flash on mobile, allowed google to develop chrome around javascript. 
I am reading through this post and it is becoming really obvious that people are using JavaScript as a shortcut for personal success. It is becoming all about "me, me, me". "I published this library", "I spoke at this conference", "I created this video to talk about the same things over and over." And you expect what exactly? To be venerated? I mean...fuck...sorry, but no. We just don't need rockstar programmers. If you wanna be famous learn the guitar but please stop trying to make JavaScript what it's not. 
no, only one of those was true

Even if it was, that's not what is happening in this and other similar cases. "Misanthropic" personalities are being replaced with jumped-up bullies and self-appointed thought controllers ready to send the mob after anyone who gets in their way. The "misanthropes" cause less damage, frankly.
Lol SJWs are gonna make node implode, fucking ridiculous. They go about publicly humiliating people instead of handling it like an adult. Node has become the most toxic programming community because of this nonsense.

I hearya. I was about to say, but but but wait... JavaScript objects follow different rules. JSON has to be all in quotes, and they need to be double quotes. But I guess that one thing doesn't actually make it an invention. Haha. Regarding the Bootstrap thing, people should put their egos aside. The approach I take is, I would looove for somebody to prove me wrong, because that just means I can discard incorrect beliefs and replace them with correct facts. In other words, improving yourself is more important than "being right." Although listening to Crockford's speeches, some of them give the impression that his view is always "my way or the highway." Not sure if that's true or not, but I wonder how he'd approach someone showing him clear evidence that something he said was wrong.
In addition to C, I write a lot of JavaScript. I've contributed code to GitHub's Atom editor.[[1]](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11552) [[2]](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12028) I've discovered and helped fix bugs in Node.js.[[1]](https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/3167) [[2]](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/3496) I've written eight npm modules.[[1]](https://www.npmjs.com/~ggreer) In short: I know the community pretty well. So please believe me when I say that the people making these accusations against Crockford aren't fools. They are competent, experienced, and capable programmers. Insulting their technical prowess is not only childish, it's simply incorrect. In my experience, one's political views and stridency have no connection to programming ability. Edit: Fixed link to npm modules.
Probably the best way to put it, though he did also [publish the first RFC for JSON](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt).
Reggie, come on dude you're capable of much better and more insightful comments than this. Comparing people to Trump is not helpful.
Yeah...I have no idea what's going on here. I thought at first { x = 123; } was evaluating to something but I can't assign it to anything. No idea what to make of this. I fucking hate ES6 shit. Edit: Not being pissy towards you. I'm just struggling with ES6.
(() =&gt; { return 123 })(); This is an anonymous IIFE function that actually returns something. I can assign it to x as in var x = (() =&gt; { return 123 })(); I have no idea how what you did is related. If I paste it into node, the console prints 123 so I thought it was evaluating to 123 but I can't assign it to anything. I fucking hate ES6. They made the language 10x harder with a bunch of useless shit as far as I can tell. I'm glad I'm not a programmer. I'd want to quit my job. Edit: Not being pissy towards you. I'm just struggling with ES6.
Its been there for a LONG time.
the tilde turns the expression into an evaluation by trying to binary NOT the result of the expression. this works with any unary operator
In a way, we all work for him...
Man I'm usually sympathetic to this kind of thing but that's pretty weak tea.
Congratulations! You found a witch! Your prize is one gold star, and nobody giving a shit! (And the gold star is just a metaphor. A metaphor for nobody giving a shit.) 
And here I wasn't sure whether or not the oft-used "people with no sense of humor" is just a reaching jab or a reasonable conclusion. Score one data point for "reasonable conclusion". 
Here is the YouTube clip of the Forward JS 4 keynote mentioned in @nebrius' tweet. It is exactly as bland and non-judgmental as you're expecting... or rather, brace yourself to be SHAMED for your SLUTTINESS! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w6tZEbrHIY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=41m15s
&gt; Thanks for putting it succinctly Steve. While we have a tremendous respect for Doug's abilities as a speaker and his contributions, we felt that based on feedback from other speakers and attendees, his presence would make others uncomfortable and it's our job to ensure everyone at the conference feels safe and welcomed. I don't think this leaves Douglas Crockford feeling welcomed. 
No thanks, I am not a necrophiliac. 
I didn't say "evidence", I said "qualification", is in: I'm providing a qualifier to define the context of my claim. I did that to differentiate myself from those making the gross fan-boy-esque claims without having actual experience with the person that we're discussing. I'm sorry if you misunderstood that.
yeah, I use the `if (~array.indexOf(item))` construction a lot. might be harder to read, but the syntax just looks much cleaner
Ah, sorry. This is what I get for skimming the post. After reading again I thought that surely there would be a performance difference between code running in a worker compared to running in the main thread?
What a bunch of losers and pathetic overly sensitive PC morons - the organizers as well as the idiots who complained. Feminists are a cancer on society. Why does everyone in the world have to conform to your expectations of whats correct?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "I'd really like to see a non-cis and/or non-white keynote. That'd be lovely.I" &gt; "I'd really not like to see a keynote from a colored or transgender person"? Those really aren't equivalent though. The first isn't saying they have anything against any demographic groups, just that they'd like to see other groups be represented as well. The second is being explicitly exclusionary to a demographic group.
&gt;"I'd really like to see a non-transgender and/or non-black keynote" But that's not what you said above, you didn't phrase it as "I want to see a non-black keynote", you phrased it as "I don't want to see a black keynote". They're really not the same thing.
I think it was meant in the spirit that no amount of technical accumen can make up for appalling behavior. With which I would agree. Caustic people are cancer to any organization. That said, I see nothing appalling going on in any of the documents on of this dust-up, just someone who might find micro aggressions in the way you tell them, "Good morning!"...
Bringing PHP to the frontend
I don't at all think these are alike. That instance seemed to be pretty sensible actually. This seems heavily overblown.
Unfortunately we are slipping into a world where the slightest offence caused makes you a monster who should be excluded from a community. We have reached a point where your choice of greeting at the start of a talk leads to name calling on Twitter. Method naming choices leads to a crusade against you on GitHub. Sometimes it is a persons own fault they are offended. Sometimes they offend themselves and need to grow up. The exclusion of Doug with no real explanation is ridiculous. All I can find is a minor crusade by one or two sjw's. Also regarding speaker diversity can conferences please publish the number of proposals submitted by men and women vs the percent of each that became a speaker at the conference. When you are paying a lot of money for a conference the quality of talks should always trump positive discrimination to ensure a diverse base of speakers.
I don't know anything about this controversy, but for me the definitive Crockford moment will always be this one: https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSLint/issues/17

Gosh why all the downvotes?
apparently you think reigning in means never inadvertantly upsetting a psychotic SJW looking for something to be pissy about...easier said than done, unless you like behaving like a passive, nervous neurotic
yes, like morality...super weird thing to care about, except the people who scream about it the loudest are usually the most hypocritical...perhaps you can complete the analogy on your own now
I'm not sure how it normally goes but where I work I'm literally the only white guy on the team of around 30 people. I've been at the company for 5 years and the only white guy on our team at any other point in time was a PM who left 2 years ago. I'm not counting designers since I never speak with them or even know their names.
I saw this comment on mobile and the formatting ruined the joke. Glad I came back to this thread on my desktop. This is the best programming joke I've heard all week.
Sounds like someone is made of aluminum foil, because their bubble is popped very easily.
Absolutely. This shit is ruining conferences.
Yeah now it's people of color as if that's somehow different. They really like their labels.
He is also saying that promiscuity was good... so he is not slut shaming anyone. He just used the word... This is master-slave terminology all over again... this people are really poison. They don't care about bringing anyone together, they just want their "righteousness" fix.

But to this point, a lot of people avoid interacting with Torvalds because of his attitude. It's toxic, and costs kernel developers. You can be right and make a point without having to shit on people constantly.
From my research, Crockford is being excluded because when in one-on-one chats with him, he fails to make them feel special.

Completely irrelevant, but I'm really interested in your flair. I'm probably a somewhat novice javascripter (I've done website work and a couple simple windows store apps). Am I interepreting it correctly: underscore is a function that takes no arguments that returns the result of calling the underscore function with no arguments. Is it just the functional way of infinite recursion that does nothing?
Js is a scripting language so you can either run it on the browser or run it on the terminal. I'll tell you how: Browser ===== There are two ways you can do it. The first way: Goto a directory and create a js file. Let's name it foo.js. write some code in that. Now make an html file in the same directory and edit it to include a script tag such as &lt;script src="foo.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;. Now open the html file in a browser and the foo.js will load and whatever code you wrote in foo.js will run in context of the html page. The second way: If you're on chrome, press CTRL+Shift+I and a developer tool window will open. Click on the console tab and you'll be able to input sungle line js code. Terminal ===== There's a tool called rhyno I guess but I haven't used it so can't say about it. I do it in node so I'll say about that. Install NodeJS on your machine sudo apt-get install nodejs or brew or whatever. Once you've installed it, you can goto the terminal and goto the directory that has foo.js and just type: node foo.js Node will run the file and treat the terminal as the console so when you write console.log in your foo.js, you will be able to see the output on the terminal.

Nobody should surprised af this. They've been teaching this kind of politically-correct fascism in schools for a couple of decades. It's finally made it's way into the real world. And yes, the goal is to censor unapproved speech all in the name of diversity.
Thanks.
While I agree with you _on some level_, /u/panda-fragment has a very valid concern, as such things _have_ happened before. Also, your comment is, ironically, toxic as hell. It's fine to swear or whatever, but personal insults wont get you anywhere. Be respectful to everyone, or you're no better than the hypocritical SJW types this whole thing was caused by.
That's the reality: They're literally everywhere by now.
results are objects, so you have to do all sorts of js hackery to format your data ex `toArray reduce pluck flatten zip partition` (or ideally use lodash) for example `select car types` gives you `[{cartype: foo},{cartype:bar},{cartype:baz}] ` not `['foo','bar','baz']` so you have to pass a callback to query and then flatten that array ... And then its not unique so you have to write a `.unique()` also... and then its 3 for-loops through your whole result set *so its slower*. or you get to rewrite your whole query because it returned an array of objects.
I know several people who have met him and spoken at conferences along side him. I'm not surprised let's just say that.

That said, we're all going on hearsay here :)
There was an issue with Windows – should work on all platforms now!
Not this again. I remember, when developers where hackers that solved real problems. Rather than having no idea how to write code, spending their time harassing open source developers and being triggered by language keywords and function names. *sigh*
You don't refute something by giving a qualification you do it by giving evidence - that is my point. 
Don't care that he's blunt in that thread - he's just some guy on the net. Do care that he doesn't explain why, he just repeatedly asserts that the coding style is dangerous. "Because I said so" is a shit argument. 
you can write a few "helper functions" to do common tasks for you, ex `FindIndexWhereEqual(val)` and `getAllEvolutionDetails()` and `toArray` and `flatArray` after writing those you will a) know more, b) can keep only the fns you need and have a little library of 5-10 fns for working with objects. many devs do this every time they write a project anyway. alternatively use lodash.js (but you would have to learn that, and its far from perfect). lodash has some cool FNs for working with uber-nested properties, like `_.has`: `_.has(array, 'foo.bar.baz.last', default_value)` 
I'm asking for evidence (eg a study). Let's go around in circles shall we
No, it's not unchecked, the man is infamous for it already. You can check it, it's not out of the question. It's a starting point. Why do I need to explain basic logic here? Drop your pitch fork and get reasonable.
The presentation wasn't too bad, in my opinion at least! However, the twitter feed of the speaker serves as a useful demonstration of a person wholly consumed by a particular kind of "identity hubris". Every other statement is one for/against a huge swathe of people based on arbitrary genetic traits.
&gt; they were the ones that accepted her. They were just afraid of being bullied if they didn't. &gt; "take doug out pls!!!!" and nodevember was like "ok" Translation: Take Doug out OR ELSE.
Richard Stallman is a crazy son of a bitch, I'd love to see his take on this.
I am in despair at these situations. SJW's are destroying communities, not building them. My wife is a research scientist - she finds SJW's at conferences looking for problems where none exist. Research science is a tough gig to be in, dominated by men - but she doesn't believe she's ever been held back because of her gender. She admits that when she wants children, this will affect her career - but she doesn't blame the industry for this, as having children is a choice. In her industry, SJW's are throwing their weight around - being overly sensitive to everything... deliberately misinterpreting conversations. Limiting and shutting down discussion. The wife says this is super dangerous in science - it'll pull us back to the dark ages. We need a non SJW conference. A conference for grown ups. Should there be any REAL offence and threat - it should be dealt with in a manner fit for "grown up's". But I find it highly unlikely that someone will run on the stage with a machete shouting 'die [insert racial/gender/homophobic/slut-shaming.... words here]'
The point of an IIFE is to create a scope to limit the lifetime of those temporary variables. With ES6's let/const, a simple block does the same.
You have been uninvited from this thread because you used the "r" word.

I welcome concrete suggestions on how to combat this growing trend. Maybe she could stop doing it, for a start.
i don’t like him and i don’t like his technical opinions. but denying his role and relevance regarding JS is idiotic, and banning him for essentially nothing is mind-boggling. i would (probably) not listen to his talks, but he really should be giving them.
Note the tossers accusing Crockford as violating the "nodevember code of conduct" ... with conduct that was not even conducted at the event, thus are not under its jurisdiction. Toddler tyrants think their sandbox rules apply in the whole universe.
personal attacks help nobody and makes your side look bad. just be factual, find out why exactly somebody has only to offer a load of crap, and then tell them to fuck off using their favourite pronouns. that’s how you do it.
Someone from Tennessee told me he was sick of the bigotry in his hometown. Now I'm not sure what kind of bigots he was talking about.
You are correct, but what I was looking for is how to have a schizophrenic function that return a function or a promise depending on the call site. It's indubitably a real bad practice too, but now I'm curious and I'd like to see a clean way to do it.
relevant part: &gt; William Golden [9:54 AM] &gt; &gt; But specifically, he was uninvited because other attendees and speakers did not feel comfortable attending/speaking with him there &gt; &gt; Andrew Albright [9:54 AM] &gt; &gt; I think to sum it up, many conference speakers have spoken with him at other conferences and generally didn't like his attitude and condescending nature, and have openly refused to speak at a conference with him in the future. Maybe some of those speakers accepted the Nodevember invite, but then discovered he was also speaking and were going to back out? …so there literally is no rational reason.
Okay, now i think they are just doing Douglas Crockford a favor. I certainly wouldn't want to be associated with a conference that has talks like that. (What the fuck is cis-passing?)
I'm normally pretty good at letting stuff like this wash over me, but Emily Rose really irks me. She sat next to me at a Node conference after she'd already given her talk. She whispered loudly with her friends throughout the remaining talks, mostly making fun of the speakers' accents (this was in Europe) and complaining that the talks were boring.
It's not a personal attack. That person does look like a slightly more feminine version of Jack Black. And I'm certainly not on anyone's side here. And since when is saying someone looks like Jack Black an insult? Wtf is wrong with you?
I know the guy who wrote that - he thinks it's bullshit too but is afraid to speak out in fear of being labeled a bigot in the community. I feel the same way unfortunately.

I wrote a tool to perform asynchronous method calls for lists of promises. * forEach * map * filter https://github.com/SeanJM/promise-array And that's not quite the whole story.

The readme generator checks for certain files: - `src/readme/description` - `src/readme/example` - `src/readme/installation` - `src/readme/notes` Then the file names in `src/readme/contents/` are added to an array. The title of the README is generated based on the `"name"` value in `package.json`, the version number is also automatically assigned from here, as well as the license. The titles for each of the `content` sections are generated based on the file names, which include a link back to the Table of Contents for quick navigation. It's something I always wanted for myself, and I'm happier with that really than the `PromiseList` project. :)
Pretty much. There are others in the local community who think it's ridiculous but don't want to be crucified by the SJWs.
What the actual fuck? So metaphors are verboten now? Does this have to be taken so literally? What a miserable bunch of thin-skinned crybabies.
It's weird. The community seems overrun with SJW safe-spacers, yet I have not worked with many of them. Almost every teammate I've ever had has been level-headed and concerned with work, not "social justice".
Fuck, I had no idea the JS community was full of these social justice warriors, it's fucked. Is this just a US thing?? It seems like this whole movement of the regressive left becoming more and more totalitarian, eating their own kind is coming from the college campuses in the US, its really disappointing seeing it in the JS community.
Let me get this straight... Brendan Eich opposes gay marriage and Douglas Crockford is a closet asshole. Please tell me John Resig doesn't eat babies!!
This "deal with it, engineers are allowed to be children" attitude is why this fields has still got a diversity problem. This entire thread is a great example, in fact, of people rushing to a man's defense simply *because* he is, by most accounts, an asshole.
Yep this is a different beast, these misguided people with seemingly good intentions cannibalising and turning on their own community, from some sense of higher sense of virtue, when in reality is just cunty behaviour
It's scary to see this trend continuing. My hope it is just a trend, and that this kind of virtue signalling will become passe in a few years. Although on the other hand, its frightening to think just how censored and totalitarian society will become, ironically from people who from the left, think they are doing the right thing. those poor stupid fucks...
Sorry why should it be? Also if you're serious 2k years of shaming women about sex not men. Btw there is way too much manipulation going on by middle class women using this history for drama and gain but any consensual sex shaming is backwards. 
safety, diversity, uncomfortable… Are those people children?
Because a large number of these people don't actually work on teams with other people; you will find that a lot of them are freelance, or make a large portion of their living going to conferences like Nodevember where they give long-winded talks about SJW topics instead of, oh ya know, the subject matter of said conferences. They make the bulk of their living on controversy. Seriously though, a lot of the companies sponsoring these conferences would never actually hire people like that simply on the grounds they would be far too much work to accommodate. Imagine, having to watch your gender pronouns in casual office conversation less that new hire files yet another complaint with HR because someone stepped on their "feelies." 
&gt; The first isn't saying they have anything against any demographic groups This is PRECISELY what these SJW types don't get. It ***IS*** saying that. In English, these two are equivalent statements: &gt; "I'd really like to see a non-cis and/or non-white keynote &gt; "I'd really not like to see a white or cis keynote" Thus if this is discriminatory and racist (which it is....): &gt; "I'd really not like to see a black or transgender keynote" So is this: &gt; "I'd really not like to see a white or cis keynote" And therefore by extension, so is this: &gt; "I'd really like to see a non-cis and/or non-white keynote And so is this: &gt; "I'd really like to see a non-transgender and/or non-black keynote
Thank you.
Thank you.

Phew, I tried but this was just so painful....
What exactly is RE:DOM?
Use Commas. You're basically incoherent. When has anyone said anything about sexuality or male/female? Are you confused with what promiscuous means?
the easiest solution is to break the second part out into a second function $('#foo').click(function(){ $.ajax({}, function(){ position1.x =... position1.y =... step2(position1) })}) function step2 (position){ var citylat = ...,.... $.ajax({}, function(){ ... code here }) } also consider doing rendering in yet another function so your code looks like this `step1(); render(step2(position)));` . so next time you can render from step 1, step 2, and any other place, ex: `render('loading'); step2(position); render(results);` you can show loading messages or share one render function for 10 ajax buttons `foo.onclick = _ =&gt; render(array_to_html_list(get_api('animals'))))` and you can keep your code more readable, each fn will only be 1-5 lines...
Dedication, focus, great work ethics with salt of Angular but learning React
&gt;Are you confused with what promiscuous means? -many transient sexual relationships Something women have been shamed about way more than men for 2 thousand years. Yes or No? Something that should have no particular concern of anyone else - least of all moral judgement. If you have an argument against that let's hear it?
So, to be clear, being promiscuous (i'd appreciate a cited definition) in the most generic sense can never lead to negative consequences? And because YOU want to make "promiscuity" about a woman, than it automatically is? Despite being a generic term that applies to anyone? I have no argument against your non position. You are projecting your own baggage on to the language.. 
"I can't backup any of my claims because at the moment I don't have access to my source, tumblr." 
Ah, thank you.
And what's more toxic than SJW's to any organization? Their tactics are literally straight from the [CIA's sabotage manual](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26184?msg=welcome_stranger) and they've crippled every organization they've infiltrated.
I felt bad for those guys. A silly private joke leads to being shamed online and fired from their jobs. 
Brilliant rebuttal. So just to be clear, No one should ever use the word promiscuous. And if you do, you better not imply it has any negative connotations! Keep on killing language and its many wonderful applications.
https://www.npmjs.com/static/images/collaboration-security.svg
&gt; yikes. it's a doxxing. 
Most of you seem pretty out of touch. Your community is not being assaulted by a cabal of feminists and SJWs. If people don't like you, they won't want you around. It's that simple.
Not tested but I don't think so.
His first comment states why "Scope confusion is a problem in this language.". Did you even read it? 
He's uninvited to an event because people don't like him. If people don't like you, not being invited places is a consequence of that. How is that surprising to you? So what is more important at what is essentially a social event? Probably "the feels". It's not like they are drafting a future ecmascript spec and excluding him. 
Wow, you just learnt the term and are already passing judgement on it
Dude! This is amazing! I will study this more in depth in a few hours, Thank you for taking the time and helping. I will see if I can implement it into my app so I can change the flair to solved so it can help others!
I quite like Seldo, FWIW. Seems like a very level-headed guy. Great tweets. Can you point out examples where he's been a 'disrespectful douche'?
Is it in github? Of course I'm interested ;)
Good question. Wasn't me that wrote that readme :) It's updated now. For 'loose' mode you would never need to type 'loose' either. It's default.
Good use case for promises... function getCityLatLong () { return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; { navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(resolve, reject) }).then(position =&gt; `lat=${position.coords.latitude}&amp;lon=${position.coords.longitude}`) } and then, getCityLatLong().then((cityLatLong) =&gt; { // perform ajax call now that you have cityLatLong }) .catch((err) =&gt; { // deal with error returned }) You should probably split out the ajax call into its own function that returns a promise, then you can `do one thing` then `do the other` and utilize the same catch block if either of them goes into error.
True, it would be wrong to pass judgement based on hearsay, but I was referring to an article that this person wrote trying to prove Crockford said something wrong. From the moment I started reading it, I looked for his actual quote. When I found it, it was just half a sentence deliberately taken out of context from a whole paragaph that had nothing to do with what she was accusing him of. And when people called her out on it and showed she was wrong, instead of correcting the record, she removed and disabled comments to silence all other voices. I can't find the article anymore though. She might have removed it.
I dunno. His rationale was that rank was broken and the the procedures of the project weren't followed. He said he would have reverted any similar commit on those grounds, and I can understand why. (As it turns out the other core dev did agree to it, but Ben apparently didn't know this.) Then again, maybe he could have said "If this is an issue, let's clean up the documentation entirely before merging." Then again again, he's [Dutch](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6846109). I'm all for the original intention of the PR, but the fallout was ridiculous. 
&gt;*"If a person who is accused of bias attempts to defend his intentions, he merely compounds his own guilt. (Here one might find oneself accused of man/white/straightsplaining.) It is likewise taboo to request that the accusation be rendered in a less hostile manner. This is called “tone policing.” If you are accused of bias, or “called out,” reflection and apology are the only acceptable response—to dispute a call-out only makes it worse. There is no allowance in p.c. culture for the possibility that the accusation may be erroneous."* From: ["Not a Very P.C.

Makefiles? Ugh.
I just launched my first React, Redux Universal App in production. Also, if you are looking to win a Truck and are a fan of College football, check it out. http://www.nissanusa.com/diehard-fan-app/sweepstakes/
if you cant make jokes without insulting a group of people, you arent making jokes youre being an asshole
Haha, no, I'm making a guess based on experience and former events. I'm guessing SJW is similar to feminazi: a term with a negative connotation to discuss an obsessed subset of a group of people who are aiming for positive changes in society.
Hi /u/srunocorn, please refrain from personal attacks. Thanks.
No disagreement there. Just saying that *if* Crawford were truly toxic, then he doesn't deserve special handling because of what he might know. It does not appear to be that is the case. Like I said, this lady seems like she would take offense at anything he says.
It's made up liberal bullshit.
Well, they are getting rekt both on this thread and on their twitter page. So there's that.
No it's not. It's a label applied to those who voice those opinions and take it *way* too far. A label applied to people who seem to have a thing for labels. People who put their made-up pronouns on their Twitter profile and drink "male tears". People who refuse to accept that Ghostbusters did poorly because it was simply a bad movie. People who want to enforce their views by shaming and harassing others (remember Donglegate?). People who seem to think that removing the gender neutral form of "he/his" from documentation and replacing it with "them/theirs" should be top priority or being hypothetically offended if they see master/slave terminology and invite their Twitter follower to spam Github issue trackers to pressure maintainers in to submission. People who will hire you because of your race instead of your merit so they can claim to be "diverse". There are people who push for social justice and then there are the social justice *warriors* - very different people. I am a pretty liberal guy who supports gay marriage and all that, but you won't find me on Twitter hating my penis and complaining about "toxic masculinity" because a video game character has muscles or anything like that because I'm not an SJW.
Are you asking me to summarize the articles and blog posts because you haven't read them or because you are trying to make some point?
Check this out for learning vanilla-vs-jquery stuff: http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/ Should be in every front-end dev's pocket.
&gt; I'm just wondering if you can get a return value from a block like this in ES6. That's exactly what I was demo'g here: let x; { x = 123; } Here, `x` is the "returned value"... only it's not returned, but it's functionally 100% the same. Here, take this example from jQuery: support.createHTMLDocument = ( function() { var body = document.implementation.createHTMLDocument( "" ).body; body.innerHTML = "&lt;form&gt;&lt;/form&gt;&lt;form&gt;&lt;/form&gt;"; return body.childNodes.length === 2; } )(); Note that it is _returning_ a value, the result of `body.childNodes.length === 2`, and assigning it to `support.createHTMLDocument`. Now here is the same thing without an IIFE, but does exactly the same thing: { let body = document.implementation.createHTMLDocument( "" ).body; body.innerHTML = "&lt;form&gt;&lt;/form&gt;&lt;form&gt;&lt;/form&gt;"; support.createHTMLDocument = body.childNodes.length === 2; } But it is a lot (IMO) clearer what your intention is, and you don't waste cycles on a function call that's essentially a no-op.
It's great. Using anything that I don't understand feels like hand cuffs. ;) it also forces me to keep things small and simple. You actually inspired me to keep things simple. I watched your YouTube talk where you showed FRZR and it helped me stay on track with thinking small and simple.
Googling to figure out wtf actually happened revealed some extremely vague tweets and this thread, and nobody actually linking to anything :/
[here it is](https://github.com/SeanJM/create-node), it's a work in progress and the unit tests are no longer covering it's features 100%, so not only is it unfinished but I'm a big fat liar. It's also why I'm keeping it under my hat... I'll less like anxious about sharing when the docs are complete and unit tests cover the code.
We don't have that in The Netherlands. Shaming people into buying shit doesn't work well here.
That whole conversation is a shocking reminder of how stupid our community can be. The fact that he used the word "gonads" in a Talk Title means he's the second coming of Hitler? That's completely absurd. The world these fuckwads are trying to create is one I really don't want to live in, where some oversensitive and underdeveloped dipshits decide that people are no longer valid members of a community.
It doesn't work well in the US either. These people keep their jobs because there are very few women in most tech companies and for some reason they believe more 'diversity' will help the company, somehow. On a completely unrelated matter, how are the tech jobs in the Netherlands? :)
Doubt Crockford gives a fuck. But ya, sucks for those who were keen to see him.
I resent the idea that fitting in or not fitting in (the ability to be yourself) is something that's purely determined by your minority status. I'm not a minority in any respect, but I have a strong personality and opinions, and I've had to learn how to coexist in professional environments with people who I detest or who I think are worthless, and yet maintain professional relationships. The onus is on you to respond to your surroundings appropriately. Naturally, we as a society have decided that people shouldn't be subjected to racist, sexist, religionist, etc... insults at work, but that says nothing about people making fun of you because of what you think. Some people need to grow thicker skin and realize that not everyone (in fact probably most people) don't agree with you.
TIL a new term: Crybully
&gt; Vue Thank you I didn't know about Vue I will check it out !
If you aren't returning a value, I quite liked `void function() {}()`. But your way certainly works!
Apparently diversity and feelings are more important than merit at a technical conference, got it. 
they are the same sort that eschew tabs for safe spaces...
That's interesting. This could actually be a genius PR move from Nodevember. Any publicity is good publicity?
Well, he agreed to attend, so, obviously, he gave some fucks at least. I guess he spent some time working on his talk, too. Of course he's a big fish and there's probably a giant queue to have him, and yet. Just saying; I think we mostly agree.
The way they went about it wasn't great either. Effectively just publicly shamed him with no evidence.
My team wanted a way to submit and vote on anonymous feedback on various topics. So I've been working on [noteworthee.io/demo](https://noteworthee.io/demo). The app is built on React, Webpack, and Firebase. Each "team" on the app has a collection of "noteboards". You can make your own team and/or noteboard by simply navigating to: ``` noteworthee.io/TEAMNAME/BOARDNAME ``` For example, if Valve wanted to post anonymous feedback on Dota2, they could just navigate to ```noteworthee.io/valve/dota2``` and start posting away. Still working on flushing out the feature set, as it's a one-man-project, but the team has been surprisingly receptive to its use! We use it for silly things such as voting on party/lunch ideas, as well as an anonymous feedback gatherer for our dev processes. Code here: https://github.com/dggriffin/noteworthee 
The article doesn't dwell on this nearly enough, it's the hypocrisy that's the killer. The intentions sound good on the surface, but always come down to making demands and expecting unilateral agreement over personal slights. Giving in to try and reach a compromise is pointless, they will just pocket your concessions and escalate the outrage. And they never practice what they preach. Once you become aware of the rules, it's impossible to take it seriously. "We want more empathy." = "Your feelings are invalid." "We want to have a conversation." = "You need to listen and agree." "You're derailing the topic." = "You're rejecting my moral authority." "I'm being harassed." = "People are criticising me." And if they can't win the argument, they will bury it, misquote it, and fan themselves silly over the imagined insolence and bigotry.
did you blog about it on your tumblr?
Basically other speaker(s) backing out because they don't like him was the catalyst . Here's a relevant blog post: https://medium.com/@nodebotanist/why-i-won-t-be-speaking-at-conferences-with-douglas-crockford-anymore-61bc29f028c8#.esi76qmi6

Heh, thank god we got rid of the words "master" and "slave". Oh wait.
I find this tool extremely handy when designing Regex queries, highly verbose and lets you know what's going on. http://regexr.com/
They're equivalent in *outcome*, since selecting a keynote speaker is basically a zero-sum game. But the intent behind them is different; one is saying they want to see better representation of minorities, the other is basically expressing dislike towards a specific demographic group. Think of it this way: someone saying "I'd like to see a black keynote speaker" doesn't imply they think no keynote speaker should be white, while saying "I don't want to see a white keynote speaker" does. And yes, some conference choosing a black keynote speaker is "discriminatory" against whites in the sense that it reduces the number of white keynote speakers in the world. But that's like saying that a company that is willing to hire men is discriminatory against women on the basis that it results in fewer positions being held by women than if it only hired women.
Thank you very very much.. This is why I love Javascript. You saved my day
turned that shit off after 30 secs.
Let NPM be insular. If they want to be known as a group of meretricious little whiners more interested in feelings than progress, let them. The rest of us will be over here, you know...developing.
I can't even say your comment triggered me, because I'm sensitive to casual jokes about guns.
What exactly did you do here?
And I can't say I appreciated the wordplay, because "play" is a word that can be used in demeaning fashion by evil people.
No. But being knowledgable about technology is a pretty good reason to have someone talk at a technology conference. 
You're being downvoted, but just wait, someone is going to bring this up seriously sometime. 
Do you want stateful functions? Then you might have a case for using a class. Otherwise just use modules. I've found that in the web dev domain space you'll want stateless functions more often than not.
I can't say 'demeaning', because it triggers me to the time someone was mean to me.
Me personally? Or looking for more info on the project itself? 
I know it is hard to believe, but it literally was caused by a single tweet in which Kas demanded his removal, without giving any reason. Not knowing why, they just removed him and shamed him on Twitter. Someone in the other topic posted a Slack chat in which they scrambled to justify their reasons. They managed to pull out the 4 damning events you already know. 1. He said 'Gonad'. 2. He said 'Kindergarden'. 3. He said 'weakmap'. 4. He said 'promiscuity'. 
I attended Nodevember last year and it was so strong on catering to SJW sensitivities that it almost turned me off from attending any more conferences. So I'm not surprised to hear something like this.
Think about array.slice vs array.splice. They essentially do the same things, with the exception that splice will actually modify the input array. var anArray = [1, 2, 3, 4]; console.log(anArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4] var slicedArray = anArray.slice(2); console.log(anArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4] console.log(slicedArray); [3, 4] var splicedArray = anArray.splice(2); console.log(anArray); // [1, 2] console.log(splicedArray); // [3, 4] Functional programming is a pretty neat paradigm.
This conversation (about master and slave) actually already happened like 20 years ago. Idiots will be idiots.
Nothing is acceptable anymore. There's plenty of activity on github of people just combing through people's code to look for offensive comments and variable names. /r/gitInaction/
Why does this remind me so much of [The Trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trial)? 
I'm with /u/xXxdethl0rdxXx on the being torn. On one hand, if these are the reasons that Crockford was dropped, they are silly reasons and the people who are critical of him on this front are wielding more power than their opinion should. But on the other hand, who is doing the framing? Are the people who made this decision *really* making it on the grounds that his comments are counter to an agenda they are pushing, separate from javascript evangelism? Or is this separate agenda a framing device used by the critics of the organizers? And, finally, --seriously-- I thought we all disliked Crockford for his hardass stances on JSLint and jQuery and YUI? Are we over that? 
&gt; But the intent behind them is different No, the intent behind them is not different. &gt; the other is basically expressing dislike towards a specific demographic group They both are. 
What's wrong with pronouns?
If this article is accurate (it's my only context on this 'thing') then what shocks me the most is how one sided the discussion is and based on such tenuous evidence. A couple of quotes without context that maybe could be interpreted to be of poor taste. An article about one cherry picked sentence that he apparently said - again without greater context of the writers other interactions with him that day. Apparently this is enough evidence to lambast a man's reputation publicly without room for recourse or offering a chance for said man to even respond. Disgraceful, and immature. The lauded node 'community' is beginning to look more and more like the clique it may always have been.
Why is it blown out if proportion? People are attacking someone else's livelihood successfully over what appears to be nothing. To me the reaction is way too mild, this shouldn't be a thing.
Looks good! 👍 FRZR got unit tests, but lack documentation - RE:DOM lacks both of them – so you're far ahead of me 😄 If you have any questions or problems, I'm happy to help! I'm always thrilled when there's others sharing the same ideology of minimalism, even when there's a lot of people fussing about big frameworks and how they are better. And laughing about small tailored libraries. Saying you're a do-it-yourself-man, even though they are just probably too lazy to learn the language and miss the beauty of having all strings in your own hand! 😊
TIL: using the word "promiscuity" now equates to "slut shaming" We should change the network diagnostic tools, as this is completely offensive to me now when I run my ethernet port in "promiscuous" mode. It is unacceptable that I'm forced into slut shaming my ethernet card.
If you think speaking like this is going to make those people, people who are easily offended, pay more attention to you, then I have news for you...
Don't you tell me about my Y chromose, man! The second I can get rid of it and join the revolution, I WILL!
It was just an example, here this is a real one I grabbed from a prominent node dev: &gt;cynically optimistic intersectional feminist pragmatic poly queer trans femininity Also I don't have a problem with someone identifying with any of these terms, even though I never heard about half of them (english is my second language mind you). It's more that there is like a 95% change that people who act this way are into the whole censorship, thought-crime, wrongthink thing. The recent drama surrounding Douglas once again proves this.
&gt; They both are. No, you're just misinterpreting it that way. Saying "I wish I could have pizza more often" isn't equivalent to saying "I don't like hamburgers".
It's perfect, let the cesspool do its job and be the cesspool.
We should have a general principle against mixing our politics (of all sorts) with our tech. Especially as politics is inappropriate to bring up at the dinner table because it could lead to disastrous relations.
I mean, he could just as well have decided to allow NaN, Inf, undefined, trailing commas or unquoted object keys, but he didn't, so those decisions made it his creation.
So, it's a programming conference where you aren't allowed to use regular Computer Science terms. Definitely something where I want to participate /s
I read this comment five times now and still have no idea what you’re on about. Care to elaborate? &gt; Also, aren't you friends with JDD? I am… Is that somehow relevant to this discussion?
Somebody help me out here... there is a huge chasm of culture that separate us. Is this an American thing or a white people thing? I mean... everyone is sooo soft and easily triggered. Everyone seems to be so delicate, what's worst is being so bitchy with their inalienable right to be flower. Jesus Christ! Imagine a forum about a programming language yet the biggest discussion is about the potential of feelings being hurt. This is pathetic.
I think OP is referring to a tendency to state pronouns other than the traditional gendered ones, such as ["Mx"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mx_\(title\))
There is a bot that automatically triggers on keywords to the OPS. Its gotten so bad, that I don't even go there anymore because I feel bad that I could unintentionally hurt someone's feelings just for asking an innocent question. Its a pretty sad state of affairs. 
You don't understand why it's a huge deal that a couple of random extremists can affect a person's career with a simple tweet and no evidence?
Are you referrign when there really was a small controversy over those terms being used in computer parts? /u/rcfox links it below.
I was. He did. This whole thing is glorious.
Ooh ooh when you're done tell him about this bridge I have for sale.
doubleplus good!
**IF** we take them completely at their word and don't care at all about forming our own opinions, then I do think that shitheads aren't entitled to speak at any event they choose and *should* be named and shamed. But they didn't provide any citations or anything, we're just expected to take their word for it. That's not cool, he doesn't really have a chance to defend himself. I also think it's really tasteless to imply that it's a private matter but they had no problem posting about the reasons why on Twitter.
In _your_ opinion those things are acceptable, in the organisers opinion, they're not, and that's totally up to them. And publicly shamed only really works if you think the things that he did were wrong, otherwise, how is he being shamed?
So some piece of shit tried to build up a career by destroying Crockford's reputation over absolutely nothing. Why doesn't the community eject the piece of shit for being toxic?
I think it's ridiculous to write someone off for using those terms, but I don't agree that words and terminology exist in a vacuum of social context. Words *do* have meaning beyond the specific use of them. I don't expect a dude like Crockford to totally get that idea--part of the idea of "privilege" that these folks use is that he wouldn't--so let's take the opportunity to discuss it rather than *publicly shame* him. And taking it a step further, if they believe that it isn't their job to educate people... still on board with that. But this is really crossing the line. Just mention a change, that's it, don't tell people it's because he's horrible or whatever.
I doubt it, given that the people who decide this are hardcore SJWs apparently. Wonder when they'll start expanding this to crack down on package names, READMEs and so on
Still with a function you don't have to pollute global scope if you don't want to. Doing it this way you will always have to assign your "returned" value to some value in a higher scope. I am curious to see if people start doing this. It goes against what everyone was taught pre-ES6. Don't pollute global scope. Heck if you're going to do things this way, why even have objects. Just chuck all your variables in global scope and make sure they aren't named the same thing. 
True, that type of politics is acceptable and necessary. What I mean is more along the lines of national politics and other ideologies that should play no part in our professions.
XML based ViewLayout engine, which should be able to render the same UI layout in different platforms using declarative XML syntax. Currently runs on JavaScript and Swift/iOS, and next target is to render on Android. In this example both the phone and it's content are being rendered using JavaScript and with the same layout engine: http://codepen.io/teroktolonen/full/LRYKwg/
Except they didn't say: "It would be nice to have more alternative gender and ethnicities give keynotes", they specifically called out whites and cis gender as something NOT to have. So once again, replace "non-cis" and non-white" with other demographics and see how quickly you'd get labeled a racist and bigot ;) Hence, double standards.
Both! What did you personally do?

73th biggest contributor and only pushed 15 commits that are only Readme / documentation updates and no source code. Hardly a "prominent contributor". https://github.com/nodejs/node/commits?author=iarna
Or fearful in using their own hard work. Plus, if someone screws up I know where to point the finger (me)!
I have a legitimate fear that people like this could wreck my professional reputation if I inadvertently say the wrong thing. Can they please be removed from the conference so I would feel safer to be there?
Actually most anecdotes I have read about were Python (the famous conference drama) and Ruby on Rails (the Ruby On Rails Girls drama) related.
I'm pretty sure she's the main maintainer of npm though
In this modern time, it seems there's a Josef K in many of us.
every dynamic language associate with the web is like this because theyre easy to get into
she works at npm, inc and is one of the main maintainers. another on twiter works at microsoft, another is also at npm and in the board of directors for node
Well, there's not a lot of technical merit in Node. Haha ... Haha ... Ha. We can still make jokes about this right? Right? Come on!! How about VB people?
I disagree with Crockford on many things, especially his position on there being a single right way to do things (the jslint debacle, his position on switching from function to block scope because it's what Java developers are used to and we shouldn't confuse developers, etc). That said, I still like to listen to him speak because he's a smart guy and thinks about things differently than i do. He's the kind of guy that I may not agree with his solution, but I appreciate his unique perspective and ability to get people thinking. Jshint and Eslint may never have existed if not for him being a jackass about jslint, and Eslint is one of the best things to ever come to the js community. He's given a ton to the community both through direct contribution, as well as his inspiration of others. I may not agree with his methods, but the js community is better because of him. That's what community is about. The people crucifying him over the dumbest thing I think I've ever seen outage about are bad for the community. These are bullies--wolves in sheep's clothes. Crockford is grumpy, arrogant, and sometimes offensive, but he's not hurting anyone. Be offended if you want, but don't expect the world to jump to your defense because you're offended. Also, if this is the kind of behavior you are going to take when someone disagrees with you, don't be surprised when more people disagree with you and call you out for your bullying.
It's not a personal attack. Thanks.
sorry, no quora for me.
Except he didn't insult anybody. The insults, offense and sexism are not in his words. They're in the heads of SJW bullies. Since they're intentionally looking for those things everywhere, and since they already decided he's a sexist, and they're the holiest of angels who can do no wrong and cannot possibly be mistaken, then they're gonna find those things, even where they're not.
Hi /u/fzammetti, please keep it civil.
As long as you comment in this sub, you'll be expected to adhere to our definition -- not yours. You've been warned.
Thank you, yes this is very helpful! I am mostly self-taught and I don't work on a team, so tips like this from either professors, mentors, or colleagues are out of my reach. I appreciate you taking the time on giving me a "general" programming tip, it's already proven useful!
The great irony is that I'm half Chinese and everybody in my office speaks Farsi; that merely pointing out the punch line of my joke has more upvotes than the joke. 
&gt; although the slut-shaming thing was overblown, even as a man I found it annoying. I can't for the life of me understand why ANYONE would be annoyed by what he said. I legitimately couldn't care even if I tried my hardest. &gt; I hope he takes this opportunity to think about how it puts people off. I mean, does he really NEED to reference sex and gender so much in a talk about JavaScript? You're **genuinely** a joke to me. If you showed me quotes of the things that he said that you claim 'put people off' without any context, I would NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS guess that ANYONE could be offended by such absolutely **inane** shit. This whole thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth, I really really really hope this 'movement' dies a quick death, but I'm starting to doubt it will happen (and you are certainly not helping the problem with this bullshit post). 
Where can I buy tickets?
It always seems to be that small bunch of loud voices who pushed the masses over the edge of stupidity.
&gt; expect(boogy(Object(NaN), Object(NaN))).to.be.true; Why wrap these in objects? Why do you expect true?
Good to know
This seems to be a major symptom of the PC movement. There is no identification and fixing of issues, only demonizing those that might not agree wholly with the mass. That behavior allows for something like this to occur where, even if misinterpreted, you are publicly shamed.
Wait, what public shaming? So far I've only read that they gave a minor statement like: "we want the conference to be comfortable for everyone." Given that he was an announced speaker, they had to say *something* didn't they? This seems like handling it almost as privately as you can. I guess they could have made something up? "Douglas had to cancel. Sorry." ?
I wish I could remember where I heard it first.
Very good points.
I would never want to be part of a community where words said in jest are used to crucify you. Groups of people that have a requirement of a PC filter need to stay home in their "safe spaces".
What is your definition then?
It's primarily an american thing, and only in certain parts of america.. generally in the more affluent metropolitan areas. Bay area/silicon valley might be the most extreme bubble. Occasionally it splashes onto some hapless foreigner unaware of our cultural oddities.. like that one dutch node guy.
&gt; The problem isn't that the conference kicks jerks out, the problem is that Crockford probably isn't one of those jerks. I absolutely agree with that. But I also think that the "SJW conspiracy" and "feels not reals" part comes about because this kind of thing of attacking people over minimal/inappropriate evidence happens fairly often.
Not being invited is not the same as being uninvited. Being uninvited is esentially a stab at public shaming, taking sides against the uninvited party. That is why you don't mix the feels with tech. But hey, that's just IMHO.
Maybe try flattening out the structure, have a look at normalizr.js, write a sensible schema then you will have less nesting. Alternately, loadash had some methods such as `get` which might help. 
Or, depending on the subsequent use-case: let ddArray = ddArray.filter((dd) =&gt; typeof dd !== "undefined");
How dare you make jokes at node developers expense. This is exactly the non inclusionary attitude we need to quell. 
..I'm appalled people use words.. 
As someone who is black but not American, I wish these people you would stop trying to save us and correcting all the past wrongs. All I care about is technical proficiency and competence as far as JavaScript is concerned. Shit like this not helping one bit.
words are so hurtful. I think we should communicate by clicking our tongues.
The example for match mode is no example: boogy('75', 75, 'strict'); // fails boogy('75', 75, 'match')) // fails boogy('75', 75); // will not fail Why does match mode fail in the above example? Without digging through the code, what does it mean to be somewhere between strict and loose mode? I don't think you can claim 100% reliability if there's not a clear definition of the rules applied by the algorithm. Intuitively, I would guess "strict mode" just uses triple equals somewhere in the evaluation. What is the intuitive behavior of "match"?
This behavior would actually be a bug. From MDN: &gt; NaN compares unequal (via ==, !=, ===, and !==) to any other value -- including to another NaN value.
He had a talk titled Monads and Gonads. I'd previously understood the issue with that talk was how he presented monads.
If your comment regarding another person pertains to anything except their words or actions, then it's likely a personal attack (or without further context, could be construed as such); at the very least, it's off-topic, which also has no place here. This includes commentary regarding a person's physical attributes, whether it's their looks, their accent, or whatever. Perhaps you didn't mean what you said as an insult, but it certainly didn't come across as a compliment, either.

Yeah, it was horrible. ...And not so surprisingly, the parent comment was deleted. I'd be pretty annoyed if I paid money and took time off from work to go see that, unless there was a different speaker during that time.
&gt; TIL: using the word "promiscuity" now equates to "slut shaming" Ban Network engineering!!! NOW!!!! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promiscuous_mode
Hi. I'm sorry to hear that I may have impacted your conference experience. I'd like to first apologize for any inconvenience my behavior may have posed. With that said I'm a bit confused about your account of this incident: To the best of my recollection I have never complained about someone's talk being boring, and I also do my best to refrain from ridiculing others for their manner of speech. Would you be willing to provide me with additional context? I'd like to know more about what happened from your perspective so that I may continue to improve the way I interact with the community at large. Thanks!
So you're just using an already available object. Same thing. Just made to look different.
Hi. I'm sorry to hear you say this. Would you be willing to explain why you feel this way?
I don't get it. are you saying morality is bad, or justice is bad? My point was just that the person with the fish fetish is mistaken about seldo's attitude towards node contributors.
Naw, I have never seen this in ##javascript and I am in there pretty frequently. The people that get banned are the active trolls (after enough string is granted for them to hang themselves) and repeat spammers. I just want to specify I never spend time in #node.js so it may or may not be such a cesspool.
This seems naive from what I've seen at least. Many of the people criticizing him have actively bullied other people.
Hey, just want to let you know I appreciate the debate. I'd say you were winning and I thank you for the help and your time.
Naw, these asswipes are just looking for attention. If you aren't frequently on some sort of broadcast social media you likely don't have anything to worry about. If you want to be safe just don't say anything that connects you to the brand, which pays your bills, and that embarrasses that brand. This is the only time (if I were the boss) that I would fire somebody for this. Otherwise feel free to say all the sexist, homophobic, racist, asinine stupidity you want. You will probably upset people, but if there isn't attention to be gained they won't attack you publicly like this.
we should also start calling it parentboard and not motherboard and replace male/female connectors with unisex connectors
Is the neutered, pseudo-corporate robo-tone to your post a preview of all that will be allowed now that the sensitive snowflakes have brought their classically totalitarian brand of witch hunt to the JS community?
Naw, she didn't mean for him to lose his job and she shouldn't have lost her job either. This was all around stupid. If anything its an excuse to avoid Twitter.
Handling this matter in public in the way that it was done was extremely unprofessional. These Nodevember people are like school on Saturday: no class. 
Cut out the tongues. problem solved!!11!!!One
Then she should have minded her own business about a stupid dongle joke between friends that didn't involve her in any way. You want to publicly shame someone over something that can be barely called offensive, you better be ready for the blowback.
**Well actually**, the word "parent" is discriminatory towards people who can't be parents, and "sex" is discriminatory towards people who were born without a sex or refuse to socially identify with a sex or a gender.
&gt; Then she should have minded her own business about a stupid dongle joke between friends that didn't involve her in any way. Agreed, but even still none of them should have gotten fired for this. Now everybody involved learned some very hard lessons that anybody can put anything about you on Twitter at any time.
&gt; I hate the whole "SJW" complaint too. Why? You just described the problem with SJWs in great detail. You clearly distinguished between the idea of social justice and what the SJWs do to people.

Depends how high up the progressive stack you are.
Yeah what's wrong with that?
Even if he had meant 'promiscuous' as a metaphor for sexual promiscuity, what's the problem? The paragraph described how the 'first web' was promiscuous, and the 'second web' was more focused on commitment, and how both approaches have their advantages. Where was the shaming?
You can't (IMO) have a healthy community when anyone can be publicly denounced on a whim like this. It's a recipe for mistrust, burnouts, etc. 
Right, I agree with you anyway. I don't think these SJWs are gonna change their minds. Hell I saw the same discussion in the linux kernel dev list a couple days ago, some chick trying to make Linus "behave". That was a good one, he didn't give a fuck.
You joke, but there was a push to rename 'motherboard' to 'mainboard' for exactly that reason.
You can have a non-binary gender identity and not be pro what you call "censorship, thought-crime and wrongthink"
They don't want you to use a 'temporary' array, but they do want you to use a new array for the first function, rather than just changing the one that was passed in to the function. The difference is if you were to write var array = [1,2,3]; var returnArray = reverse(array); where `reverse` is the function that you're writing, the for the first function the following would be all be true after the call: array is not the same object as returnArray returnArray would be [3,2,1] array would be [1,2,3] whereas for the second function: array would be the same object as returnArray returnArray would be [3,2,1] array would be [3,2,1] you don't really need to collect returnArray, as you could just access the result via array, so you could just write return(array); instead, which just discards the function's return value 
It didn't start with the millenials, it mostly seems it was indoctrinated into them en masse by their teachers.
His remarks were sexist, which is ironic given the event. That aside, it took both the original remark and his response to a later BBC interview to really upset people. His name was well known and publicly associated to his employer, which is the real problem. Don't connect controversy to your employer.
His remarks were not sexist, that's the thing. He told a self deprecating joke about falling in love with female lab assistants, then out and out stated it was a joke, and went on to actual posit the importance of various female scientists. Then people deliberately misquoted and in some cases out-and-out lied about the speech and the audience reaction to it in order to publicly shame him. And yet he was fired and the journalists who were found to have lied about the event are still in good standing with their employer. Furthermore, at the event, Sir Hunt was there representing himself. So, if you want to be consistent, you're gonna have to change your advice of: &gt; If you want to be safe just don't say anything that connects you to the brand, which pays your bills, and that embarrasses that brand to include &gt; Don't be well known, or leave any way for people investigating to find your employer
Instead of taking the time to only respond in a naive condescending manner to comments like this one, spend more time reading the other comments here talking about you. Perhaps Google your name, it didn't take me long at all to dive into the Opal drama that you're now synonymous with. Instead you act like your personal views triumph and you're dumbfounded that someone would say something you don't like to hear about you. 
Gotcha. Thanks for the tip!
It's a little bit more complex than that. There's possibly true and also possibly false which are two separate conditions. In response to a hostile environment someone can do a pre-emptive resignation: "fuck this place i'm outta here". Someone can also, after an incident of some kind be brought in to the boss's office and told, "Listen, we've had some complaints but you've been too good for us to fire so we're asking you to take this huge severance package and we promise to keep it quiet if you leave". The reasons why they're possibly cases is because in both cases it can't be confirmed. The reason why one's possibly true and one's possibly false is that the truthiness is approached from either side respectively.
Other than the "blue hair" thing, I've never seen it used in completely inappropriate circumstances. Have you seen it used in circumstances (other than the silly blue hair thing) where they weren't bullying anyone, weren't trying to make someone who disagreed shut up, didn't namecall, weren't trying to claim to be correct because of victimhood status, didn't elevate emotions over facts, didn't try to police language, didn't try to shame anyone, didn't stereotype or try to exclude large groups, and didn't do any of the other things that are associated with SJWs? 
Contained in the perception of the easily offended. 
Instead of passing in a param to choose strict or loose you should just export them as functions. This way you can choose on import
Ironically, you can't just seem to say 'gotcha! Thanks!' and move on in the same condescending way to the 'patriarchy' you put so much more effort into rebelling against. 
Good idea! The changes will come very soon.
Exactly, I took some of the guys courses hes a good teacher (I even out of my way to buy his free books) but the way he quickly started bashing him was insane, It seemed like he hated him before and was just waiting for an opportunity to bash him. When he didn't even know what the situation was actually about. He lost my respect, that was unprofessional.
The best part is, you don't have to be! Don't call them, they'll call you.
&gt; Furthermore, at the event, Sir Hunt was there representing himself. So, if you want to be consistent, you're gonna have to change your advice of: He was representing himself at the conference, but not in the interview with the BBC. Once he was connected to his employer by name during an interview he became the representative thereof.
If someone ask you your name, it is "Hugh Mongus"
So you changed your mind because of speculation about him making people uncomfortable. If I could remove people from events because I'm uncomfortable, barely anyone would be at the events I go to. But that's kind of an ass of me isn't it? Anecdotal, but I haven't seen anyone "jumping on" the SJW hate train (hear me out). The SJW hate for people's expression has grown steadily out of hand and it's reached a breaking point where there's high conflict. This is why, I believe, most interactions these days involve lashing back, or at least, that's my reasoning for lashing back, because it's become unreasonable to accommodate. Chronology of SJW response over the years, the way I see it 1. Yeah, okay, we could be more sensitive. 2. Right, okay I guess we could be *more* sensitive. 3. Umm.. 4. Ummmm... 5. Uhhh! ! ! Fuck &lt;- **we're here** 6. So what *can* we talk about? &lt;- we don't want to get here Some thoughts. Programming/scripting/whatever is a science and art all rolled into one. It's creative. Creative thrives in uncomfortable environments because it allows the full range of thought. Further, creative dies in stifled environments. A point here could be made that being uncomfortable is stifling, and that's where I'll point you to #1 and #2 of "Chronology of SJW response". I guess: &gt; based on private feedback - not simply the dialogue on Twitter - that his presence would make some speakers uncomfortable to the point where they refused to attend or speak I need more than this. If nothing more is said than this is a desire of the few that outweigh the desire of the many situation. They've already slammed him and are still insisting he's done or said things of significance. **Because of that, I don't think they have anything or they would have said it**
*The database instance may be running in either the "whiner" or "pushover" mode. In "whiner" mode, the instance is responsible for unilaterally reacting to any events that occur, and passing those reactions on to the "pushover" which should unquestioningly implement the requested changes.*
They could have done better, but in the end no one has an unalienable right to be presenting at a conference. If conference wants to have speakers A, B and C and C doesn't want to present if A does, it's up to organizers to decide who they want more. And up to attendees to decide if they want to attend. All the politics around it only confuse the issue — in the end it's the organizers decision based on what speakers and attendees they want. People who dislike these decisions can make their own conferences with a different lineup.
Thanks for feedback. I will look into it soon. Just now fixing the source based on input from Redit. Some major changes will happen asap.
Also, based on your logic, shouldn't you be praising "SJWs" for making you uncomfortable, and by doing so, increasing your creativity?
they. dun. goofed.
That's the thing, there isn't any speculation, there's actually other speakers saying this. They've said they won't speak if he's there, so something's gotta give. And this is what side you gotta pick I guess: ditch these speakers or ditch Crockford? Nodevember chose the latter. When you examine what the priorities are of this particular conference, this decision makes sense, for better or worse. I still think they handled it in a shitty way, but they've owned up to that. You and I may have kept Crockford instead, but it's not our conference. One might ask why they even invited him in the first place, but that's another discussion I suppose.
I'm a white male so I'm fucked.
This have been implemented. Also NodejS modules are now supported.
This will be fixed within a few hours.
&gt; No, it's not unchecked, the man is infamous for it already. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_reasoning
No need to give them carte blanche. When it came to Nodevembers attention that some "precious petals" take issue with Crockfords past behavior they should have contacted him and sorted it out. Perhaps some sort of compromise could've been reached. My point is, anything would've been better than the public slam and disinvite with no explanation. Reflects poorly on the conf and makes it seem like they're kowtowing to fringe elements imho.
I'm trying to avoid the whole "it's their conference" thing. It is, but I feel it shuts down conversation. I mean they can do whatever they want. The post DID clear some things up, and the lack of experience context makes a lot of sense. Everything is in context right? The context here is speakers are refusing to speak and people refuse to go to the event. They don't need to name names... but how many? The amount of times I've heard phrases like that, and it's been one or two people at best, is far too high. If they had something, a *reason*, it would be #1 on the agenda that would shut people like me up. I'll have to shut up though, anyway, because I mean... a project is now nearly late... oh, internet. Probably 5 years ago I'd agree here too. I mean, damn, he must be really saying some crazy shit to make so many *refuse* to participate... but really, there's been a lot of petty stuff too. It's like soccer players faking injuries. Edit: didn't add past tense.
Java and JavaScript are two different things. You don't compile JavaScript, you run it in the browser. Put a script tag in your html file and open in a browser. If you're asking about Java, you're in the wrong subreddit.
You're not disagreeing with anything he said. You wouldn't be able to tell you got banned from #node.js, just like I didn't realize for months I had gotten banned from /r/offmychest for mocking the blowhards at /r/the_donald. 
http://i.imgur.com/p9ye1gU.gif
This isn't much of a clarification. The only new information to come out here is they claim their decision wasn't based solely on the tweets everybody is talking about. They don't clarify why they're uninviting him. They just talk about the "many facets" of the issue. When this all came down, everybody wanted to know what Crockford had done or said. What kind of outrageous, bigoted thing must he have said to be so publicly shamed? We got offered some examples that were shocking -- not because of anything Crockford said, but exactly for the opposite. He was being touted as some kind of monster for using the word promiscuous without any sort of sexual reference whatsoever. You'd look like an absolute fool for calling Crockford a bigot, sexist, etc for such things, so of course Nodevember doesn't want to cite their evidence.
Not related to node really, but I went to a small devops conference last year and could not believe how 'activist' it was in nature.
Hm, that's an interesting point. I think relative performance is actually the main interest, but that might also affect layout/paint performance asymmetrically. Main thread it is.
Trigger warning: people with hyperactive disorders should not read the above comment
How dare he! The man obviously hates children. Get 'em boys!
Hi Emily. I appreciate that this public venue is not the ideal way to have this conversation, but it appears to be the preferred venue for hard discussions right now, and this is an opportunity to have a discussion I am greatly interested in advancing. I am a professional software engineer, working primarily on web applications. While my day to day doesn't primarily involve Javascript, I'm required to be able to write it as part of my job. I never learned Javascript in school. I never had a teacher or mentor or friend. I had to learn it on my own, on the job, fast enough to not get fired. The way I learned this was via Douglas Crockford's book, _JavaScript: The Good Parts_. In a very real sense, Douglas Crockford is why I got and kept my first job. I am not involved in the Javascript community, and I haven't the foggiest idea why he is considered to be a threat to diversity and inclusivity. The only data point I have to go on, is your tweet. As best I can tell, the man responsible for _including_ me, a member of an ethic and religious minority, in this industry is Mr. Crockford. To see your comment, without any additional context, and watch as community leaders take it seriously, without at any point explaining how or why, comes across to me as an attack on diversity and inclusivity. If he had been excluded from this community from day one, which is what you appear to be advocating, then I would not be employed right now. Maybe this is a political battle for you, and you feel strongly about winning. You feel strongly that you're on the Right Side. I would like you to know, that your winning comes at the cost of at least one excluded minority. With the above said, [tryingtobeanonymous7's comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/50u77r/douglas_crockford_removed_as_a_keynote_speaker_at/d77x6m8) alarms me. It is not charitable, it is not kind, and it lacks almost as much context as your tweet does. I suspect s/he didn't expect you to see it, and I hope the fact that you did encourages them to be kinder in the future. That said, I have seen the exact scenario s/he has laid out, happen in the past. I have witnessed vocal leaders in various technology communities talk a big talk about diversity and inclusion online and in their professional lives, but fall back on all sorts of problematic behaviour in private. I've seen the creators of a major Javascript framework making classist, racist, sexist, and transphobic remarks in private. I've heard activists and advocates making all manner of terrible, horrible statements about people when they think nobody is listening. So please, try and see this from my perspective. A person responsible for including this minority in tech is being accused of sin, and as a result, blacklisted from a conference on which he is a very relevant speaker. The accusation has no context, while I am hearing negative commentary about the accuser that sounds very, very familiar to me. What am I supposed to make of this? I'll be honest with you: your actions are threatening to me. Unlike many of my peers and coworkers, I didn't enjoy their privilege. I didn't get to go to a good university. Nobody helped me support myself. I've been an immigrant in the United States, with all the mistreatment that implies. I've worked hard to get where I am. And now I'm faced with someone who claims to be on my side, but is attacking a hero of mine with no justification, explanation, or context. And to make matters worse, she uses people like me as a rhetorical tool to do this. This is not ok. I didn't enter this industry because I have a passion for witch hunts. I just want to make cool things and support myself while I do it. I don't want to have to live like this. I don't want to defend terrible behaviour, either. If Mr. Crockford is acting inappropriately, that needs to be addressed. If he is bringing toxicity into our communities, we can't allow this. But that's not what I'm seeing. What I'm seeing are accusations devoid of context. That scares me. My family already lived through one purge, where seemingly overnight behaviour like this turned into bands of bandits enacting vigilante justice against my family. I believe you, that you're acting in good faith. I don't think the world is so bad that there are people just scheming about how to take down guys like Mr. Crockford. But I also notice, when someone has made a statement about your negative behaviour, you didn't actually deny it. You apologized generally, without acknowledging what was said. You also didn't deny it, but simply stated you didn't remember it. This does not come across charitably. While your commitment to resolving these conflicts going forward is admirable, your response leaves me uneasy. To that end, I would like to ask you a few questions in the hopes that we can clear up our differences, and I can walk away feeling slightly less afraid. 1. What things has Mr. Crockford done that make you so concerned about his presence? 2. Why do you feel that those things necessitate banning him? As opposed to making him commit to a code of conduct, and only banning him if he violates it? 3. How do you balance your concern against his being a threat to inclusivity, with stories such as mine about how he is responsible for including me? 4. Do you believe it is possible to peacefully coexist in the same community with people who you believe to be problematic? Or do you require that they be excluded? I am interested in building communities that are more resiliant to bad actors like this, and seek to include peoples' valuable contributions, while preventing and mitigating the damage they might do in other capacities. ---- As a parting thought, a counterpoint. A conference I was excited about attending recently went through a similar crisis, but handled it very differently. A speaker with problematic views was given a talking slot, and in response people pressured sponsors to pull out. The conference organizer, however, maintained an admirable commitment to including _everyone_, even people who may have objectionable political views. He stood firm on a code of conduct that policed behaviour, not opinions, and publicly committed to expelling this speaker if he used his speaking slot to espouse political views that threatened the safety of conference attendees. Impressed by his stance, some friends and I put together a crowdfunding initiative for him, which you can see [here](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/save-lambdaconf-and-an-open-society--3). We were able to raise enough money that the conference continued. By all accounts, it was a great success. The organizer's commitment to his code of conduct allowed the objectionable speaker to present an interesting talk without making the attendees feel unsafe. The conference had a higher attendance than ever before, selling out for the first time. There was absolutely no negative commentary about his talk on social media. Most importantly, this demonstrated a third way. We successfully proved that we can have a fun, safe, and productive conference without having to ban speakers for unrelated opinions and viewpoints. By aggressively focusing on specific, concrete, actionable behaviours and events, we were able to effectively support everyones' needs. I would like to see more events taking that stance. This ubiquitous pattern of pre-emptively banning speakers is alarming, and I choose to believe that there is a better way. Would you be willing to comment on this? Thank you, -Simon
...and please continue to down vote me. You're just proving my point for me.
&gt; Don't crucify someone over a faux pas. I witnessed a similar event last year and am still uncomfortable over it. I was in attendance at ElixirConf 2015 in Austin, TX. The keynote speaker, an established engineer with 30 years of work experience and several books published, gave a talk about web application architecture and how it goes in cycles, between thin-client client/server interactions and heavy-client interactive interactions. Given that this was a dry talk, at 8 am, he tried to spice it up with periodic jokes and references. He maintained an ongoing Back To The Future joke. Towards the end of his discussion, he played [this clip from the Big Bang Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTeRlfBphU0), where they discuss the appropriate grammatic tense to use when talking about time travel. This scene ends with a throwaway joke that goes like so: * "Hey, where are the girls anyway?" * "Oh. They left, so we could get some work done" The joke, completely unrelated to everything and occupying less than 1% of the clip, is that they wanted to get work done but they were wasting time on nerding out instead. But someone stirred up drama on Twitter, claiming that this speaker, by playing this clip, claimed that women cannot do science. A small, vocal minority (maybe 20% of the attendees at best) made a stink, and as a result, after we came back from coffee break, the conference organizer took a moment to publicly denounce the keynote speaker, blaming him for being problematic, removing him from the rest of the event. Over a unrelated throwaway joke in a clip that he probably didn't even know was there. Nevermind that the conference organizer is supposed to vet talks beforehand, and therefore already approved of this. The amount of hysteria drawn up over a clip from a primetime comedy show that is rated PG-13, and the willingness of the conference organizer to throw him under the bus to appease the drama, alarmed me so much that I walked out of the conference, mid-talk, and didn't go back. I really, really don't want to see things like this. Maybe some people are made uncomfortable by this (though, in this case, I'd argue that that's on them). But I'm not ok with this immediate jumping to the worst possible interpretation all the time. Communication is hard, we all come from different backgrounds and contexts, there's going to be some misunderstandings. The speaker was friendly, nice, intelligent, and completely non threatening. He tried to make our experience better, by injecting levity into his talk. Instead of interpreting it in the spirit it was done, and (being generous here) pulling him aside and saying "hey, that was poorly received, can you apologize and not do it again please?", he was crucified, publicly. This is disgusting. It's to the point where I will not give talks at conferences, despite being a very experienced software engineer, because I'm afraid of walking facefirst into this kind of thing. This Is Not Ok
RubyConf's opening keynote last year was the same activist blame game crap. Nothing technical or even Ruby specific was even discussed. Really set a poor tone for the event and I won't return to another. 
It would seem the SJW brigade has arrived, to start dishing out digital justice by way of down-votes to all those not apart of their Twitter clique. It too noticed my comments being down-voted.
I think it started with gender studies and third wave feminism, and spread via liberal arts pseudoscience education over the past 30+ years. It seems to have now nearly reached maximum absurdity. 
Help a brother out here...please... but how the fuck is this related to using the world nigger around a black person. Is the word nigger a part of your vernacular? Do you go around casually using the word nigger all the time and hate it when a black person coincidentally walks by and over hears you. You sound like someone with no fucking sense.
Omg yes. 
Merit is a repressive construct created by the patriarchy to oppress the otherly capable. /s I'm joking but unfortunately not every one is. https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/20rame/i_have_recently_learned_that_meritocracy_is/
There are a lot more people who want to be 'involved' in this community than there are actually competent programmers. 
&gt; I don't agree that words and terminology exist in a vacuum of social context. Literally no one has claimed that...
&gt; They are unabashedly quick to block people on Twitter - to not engage. This is a huge point for me. It's amazing how many times I've asked prominent people *honest questions* — questions that are not loaded and pass the [comment flowchart test](https://twitter.com/seldo/status/772184684805492736) — and have been blocked in response. I understand how much flak and aggression some of these people get, but it smacks of prejudice and anti-intellectualism that such discussions are not only ignored — but actively tuned out.
&gt; They don't need to name names... but how many? The amount of times I've heard phrases like that, and it's been one or two people at best, is far too high. It's weasel words. It's the same tactic that Trump uses when he says things like "Many people are saying...", and it sets a terrible precedent, plain and simple.
Wait, what's wrong with kindergarten?
You got my upvote. Fuck those SJW and their PC bigotry.. 
Thanks for the support! I wholeheartedly agree. 
I can't handle your ideas. Reporting you right now.
&gt; They could have done better, but in the end no one has an unalienable right to be presenting at a conference. No, but many of us believe in the ethical mandate to support the free and open exchange of ideas. &gt; If conference wants to have speakers A, B and C and C doesn't want to present if A does This is very easy for anyone with a backbone: Pick the speaker that doesn't try to excise others from the public sphere for daring to disagree.
Relevant username.
I believe the lose-lose situation is that on the one hand, /u/escape_goat cannot agree with the so-called SJW point of view, for the reasons they so eloquently described in their comment. But on the other hand (and I'm starting to infer here), the one applying the SJW label is making use of similarly unjust tactics. As with any label, branding someone allows us to stop thinking of them as a human, and merely treat them as an idea. One commenter went as far as to refer to Kas Perch as 'cancer'. This is a tone I've seen throughout the discussion on this whole Crockford situation, recent CoC discussions, etc. Who's right or wrong in this specific decision doesn't really matter. /u/escape_goat feels unable to wholeheartedly support either side, and I happen to feel the same.
&gt; I'd like to know more about what happened from your perspective so that I may continue to improve the way I interact with the community at large Your sophomoric regressive behavior is an embarrassing, destructive repudiation of every liberal ideal our industry has led the charge for and fostered over decades, and you should be ashamed of yourself. Instead, you're bolstered by a sycophantic groupthink maintained -- literally -- through exacting revenge on those who might otherwise point out the flaws in your presumption of ideological infallibility. You harm your ostensible cause, you harm our industry, and you harm *individuals*, and yet pretend to do otherwise. It's immoral, wrong, and clearly high time we stood up against your bullying culture of feigned victim-hood. 
And mine. Great comment.
There's a huge difference between hostile and uncomfortable environments. 
That's a damn shame. His educational material is great, its sucks that he engages in such material. Just another example of why it's important to be able to separate art from artist.
On the desktop browsers the limit goes on IE9, basic features work but not animations. IE10+ also animations work, so that's approximately the browser compatibility limit there. On mobile at least Android 4.1 and 2.3 seems to work. On 2.2 the Codepen did not work :(. iOS 5 &amp; 4 &amp; 3 seems to work. 
"itself"?
use `form: formData`
I'm not trying to be naive here, but how is the quality of a monolithic framework related to a cultural sensitivity issue? 
I've been boycotting Brandon Eich since he donated to prop 8. I'll also boycott Douglas Crockford since he clearly hates women and children.
That's really not cool to call anybody an "it". How lovely that we're at a point where this statement has been downvoted.
They're parasitic, as soon as your project gets big enough they will infiltrate it and begin to whine about some perceived injustice until they turn it into shit.
I sure hope it wasn't programmed to have feelings.
I'm offended by one or more words you said and demand you be banned from this subreddit. 
Even if you were gay being white would still leave you with a net negative amount of SJW points. Maybe if you were a "trans gender fluid non binary aboriginal spirit animal" in a "plural relationship" with "black Muslim hermaphrodite" and an "asexual homeless person that self identifies as a half werewolf half oyster" your opinion would matter. 
Meat tosser!
This module now works after the specs when it comes to NaN. NodejS own deepEqual algo are based on "loose" and works. Same for Boogy. Loose mode works. However strict mode is a TODO. There are issues with Symbol() if I go for a quick fix.
&gt; var formData = querystring.stringify(form); get rid of this. its not needed with `request` -- which I'm assuming is the library you're using? You don't specify.
Overall a pretty good article though 
Ahh, the old be more inclusive by excluding people trick. 
My apologies then. That was the impression that I was left with. Could you please clarify what circumstances where you referring to then when you said "Our mission is bigger than any one of us, and under the present circumstances, I cannot be an effective leader.”? 
Inclusivity without critical thought.
form id has no barring. if you want, look at the network tab (be sure to check [x] preserve log) in chrome and send me the curl request (right-click on the url you are posting to). If you don't want to do that, look at the "Request" section of the network request and see what params are sent along with it. Some login forms require user-agent, etc. and other bs. like unique tokens. I can take a look and tell you how to do it in request. I write authenticate bots all the time, so you're probably just missing something silly.
Right, so how does that affect the code? 
&gt; Lets get him boys! T R I G G E R E D you should've said "persons"!
Is it not ok to refer to a "man" as "him" anymore either or is that offensive too?
&gt; The new Ghostbusters movie was bad because the filmmakers were catering to SJW's by making the Ghostbusters female. Instead of...ya know...just being a bad reboot, like the rest of the time Holywood does it. I haven't watched it because the trailer looked awful, but from what I've heard, it sounds like pressure from SJWs caused them to decide to make chick Ghostbusters. "Lookit, we have token chicks" is not a plot. And their idea of a marketing campaign was to put out an awful trailer, wait for the inevitable downvotes, and cry sexism to get attention, thus shaming anyone who honestly thought it looked bad. Shaming someone who has an opinion they don't like is a standard SJW tactic. &gt; The new Battlefield game has been influenced by SJW's because because there are more black and sikh people in the game than historically accurate. I haven't heard of this, but it doesn't sound like they're using the term incorrectly. SJWs like some races and religions (black and sikh) and dislike others (white and Christian). Pushing for historically inaccurate token people from "good" races and religions is something they'd do. If this is what it sounds like, they're elevating their emotions about certain races and religions over the historical facts. &gt; SJW's are ruining comics because the new Iron Man is a black woman, or because Iceman is now gay. I used to collect comics as a kid. My favorite character was Spider-Man. I stopped collecting when they decided to turn Spider-Man into a clone and tell us that he's been a clone for the past decade or so. It was like a slap in the face. This guy who you related to and cared about? He's not real. He's not the hero anymore. We're taking him away. Making changes is one thing. Making changes simply so you can virtue signal about it "lookit diversity" is something else. And taking a good character and throwing it away so you can virtue signal about it is just awful. Is the new black lady Iron Man cynical and arrogant and rich and a genius, just like Tony Stark? If she is, she's just Tony Stark with tits and melanin, and there's no reason to make the change. If not, then she's a new character, and anybody who loves Tony Stark will have had a great character taken away from them for PR purposes. Ruining a good thing so they can shove token diversity down people's throats is an SJW thing to do. &gt; "Could you not call them trannies?" I'm sympathetic to this, since that's a slur, but then, not everyone knows that it's a slur. If you just tell them not to use a word, that looks like language policing. 
Huh looks like ChatCAT
ok, maybe i'm confused. aren't you trying to automate a login to a web site? Give me the network tab view of the POST request where you submit your username and password. The one that actually works. You can black out the username/password but i need to see all the data that is sent in the request.
I really want to see an SJW mob try to go after DHH for something, that would be entertaining to watch.
killer app for node (finally)
Brendan Eich (creator JS) lost his position as CEO of Mozilla because he publicly came out against gay marriage. I definitely disagree with his position but to make the guy lose his job? Seriously?
I don't think anyone should be fired but I sure as shit am not using that word in public.
If you're saying it's not even an insult, you're right. An insult is harmless. This is a public smear, which is far worse. All of a sudden, 20 years of working your ass off and making contributions don't matter anymore. Conferences uninvite you, publishers cancel contracts, tech companies refuse to work with you, etc. Can you think of an insult that's worse than that?
There are no leaders, only those who create them.
async/await sounds like you're having sex with a slut. we should definitely avoid that. and "generator"? good god. boners anyone? callback is the polite thing to use.
nope that's the correct token, but its going to be different each time. So you need to strip it out with a regex: `/Avz.CSRF_TOKEN = '([^']+)/` 
it will not always be the same, that's why you need to grab it first.
Yeah. That was a classic case of feeding the troll. Hard to resist though.
I am a bit late to the party, but I created a simply lovely little minimap for the dom. It is really quick and can just be dropped into any application: https://github.com/reminyborg/dom-minimap
&gt; Crockford has acted inappropriately, and it is being addressed. Nope. This entire reply is a shining example of [motte &amp; bailey doctrine](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/03/all-in-all-another-brick-in-the-motte/). When challenged, retreat to reasonable-sounding platitudes like "I am only expressing my concern for the overall health and growth of the community." The rest of the time, engage in outright attack of fundamental liberal ideals and social ethics -- including free expression and the open exchange of ideas -- by deploying regressive tactics and rhetoric more reminiscent of the Maoist Cultural Revolution than J.S. Mill. Quoting you: &gt; The reaction that we're seeing to the Nodevember Un-Invitation Incident™ is one born of fear for repercussions of toxic behavior. Full stop. This is exactly the kind of silencing rhetoric in question; one that admits no possibility of fallibility, creating a circularly-supported unassailable position from which *any* critique may be dismissed as the hitherto undefined and nebulous "toxic behavior" that justified your choice to "speak up when I see something that seems wrong" in the first place. Despite your protestations of righteousness, this is nothing more high-brow than engaging in playground bullying. "Full stop."
I wouldn't worry too much about it. Most of it is just basic politeness and professionalism, and though definition of politeness changes over time, there is nothing "SJW" about it. People like to point to "over-reactions", but most of those are trivial. If someone writes to me to say my pet project name could be improved, I'm likely to oblige — I don't care either way, but they do. If someone uninvites me from a conference, it's their loss — but I'll also think on how I could be a better presenter (maybe cut down on jokes people dislike).
What about those that identify as non-persons, or multi-persons as is the case with headmates?
that should work, since you're doing exactly what a user does. First they request the homepage (a token is set) and then they do a POST request using that token.
well it should be the login page. and yes it'll change everytime you re-use it. But it should work if your cookies are being sent.
It's a conference -- by definition it has a limited lineup and limited time and cannot support every idea possible. It's likely that they will replace Crockford with someone who presents less often, which to me feels more valuable as the ideas might be fresher. &gt; Pick the speaker that doesn't try to excise others from the public sphere for daring to disagree. And what makes this a general principle applicable to every conference? If I was inviting some people, and A and B told me they don't like C, inviting C and dropping them just in spite would be a really weird choice.
I don't see any different point of views here. They don't have professional disagreement with him, instead they feel that some of his behavior is unprofessional. In my work, if I was sitting next to some, let's say, vocal racist, it would be intellectually uncomfortable, but not in a creative way. I mean, I could argue with them, but in the end that's not why I come to work (or conferences) -- it's just a waste of time.
It is interesting how the NAACP doesn't reverse the initials. Reversing them would clear up any confusion about what is and isn't allowed.
HOW DARE YOU MAKE FUN OF MUTE PEOPLE
Fuck off. No one needs pitch forks. It's immature 4-chan behavior that shouldn't be used by anyone on anyone on either side. Grow up.
&gt; inviting C and dropping them just in spite would be a really weird choice. It's not spite. It's ethics. If you truly don't want to schedule someone's talk on it's own merits, that's different ... but figure it out *before* you invite someone. However, what we have here are intolerant people trying to bully others into "de-platforming" someone they disagree with.
Suppose it costs 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 ... for Achilles to get to the position where the tortoise was. There are infinite time slices, but they sum up to a finite number, 2. What if we do something in each step and then watch the result? It is unpredictable and I think that fits definition of random.
You can be part of both communities. I'm a programmer by career, using JavaScript professionally. I normally hang out on the r/programming sub, but there isn't a reason why I can't come here to see this communities reaction, and provide my own.

Because "SJW" has become an overused meme, used against women in situations that *aren't* to problem the OP described, usually by alt right folks. So by even using the term you end up having to clarify that you don't agree with *those idiots*, but have a valid point to make. It's not a winning situation to be in.
Let's parse this: &gt;Crockford has acted inappropriately Crockford has done something wrong (although you won't specify what). &gt;and it is being addressed. You and several others, without specifying what exactly he's done, used public pressure to intimidate a conference organizer into doing what you want. &gt;At the risk sounding meta; this is why you're aware of the situation in the first place. Being accused of something is somehow evidence of guilt. &gt;Again, I understand that you don't have the context You're probably not going to say what Crockford's done because that "context" is too complicated for peasants.
there is a huge difference between being saddened by the state of the world, and being offended... I dont take offense to people identifying a particular way, but it does sadden me that people feel such a strong need... whatever happened to just being a nice person? now everyone needs special recognition for how they feel?... its sad.
basically its asking you to use the same array and swap the values.
Lol. Not true in 2016
here is a better example.... try when eating at a restaurant, telling a black person, that someone: left the waiter a niggardly tip. and then brace yourself.
So ignorant, unread people with poor vocabularies should be the arbiters of public discourse?
yes, anyone of any gender or ethnicity could flex their arms... unless they are an amputee or paraplegic or born without arms. I don't see the ADA protesting this joke.
Correct me if I'm wrong but the looks like it all this started on Twitter w @nexxylove because he said something about not using weak maps because they're not masculine. Idk the intent behind his comment but I don't want code that can't complete because it's busy worrying about what some other code is doing. Stop blocking people :D
I think the SJW aspect of it comes primarily from [@nexxylove](https://twitter.com/nexxylove). Some of the previous thoughts about douglas being not invited because of toxicity may have been a red herring. Douglas Crockford was excluded to increase "inclusivity". [@nexxylove](https://twitter.com/nexxylove/status/771503406716334080), 6:22 PM - 1 Sep 2016: "@nodevember one way you could show you actually care about community safety &amp; diversity is by uninviting Douglas Crockford." [@nexxylove](https://twitter.com/nexxylove/status/771508792655618048), 6:43 PM - 1 Sep 2016, referring to an all male lineup in a previous tweet: "If you value a community where diversity and inclusivity are top priorities, please boycott @nodevember. This is unacceptable." Then **6:52 PM, Sept 1st** (note the time, this is important): "I'd like to hear a statement from @egdelwonk, @jasonamyers, and @kevinold on concrete steps they plan to take to make their event inclusive." https://twitter.com/nexxylove/status/771511124206333954 The response from [@nodevember](https://twitter.com/nodevember/status/771519155283431424) at **7:24 PM - 1 Sep 2016** (30 minutes): "@nexxylove We’re going to remove crockford from the conf, and reach out to more folks to better represent the community. I’m truly sorry." In which @nexxylove compliments on their decisive action. Funnily enough, I think if they left it at that, saying "we'd like to have a diverse range of people so we're removing Douglas Crockford etc" things might be a lot better... but instead they: [@nodevember](https://twitter.com/nodevember/status/771520648191483904): "We will also be removing Douglas Crockford from our keynote speakers list to help make the conference a comfortable environment for all." And instead of clarifying saying that it was about having keynote speakers of different genders and pleasing @nexxylove (which, I'm speculating here), they dug deeper: [@nodevember.org](http://nodevember.org/statement.html) "...that his presence would make some speakers uncomfortable to the point where they refused to attend or speak" I think @nodevember here is trying to cover their ass and @nexxylove threatened @nodevember with a boycott. @nodevember succumbed immediately (within half an hour) due to inexperience. So this brings to, why did @nexxylove want to boycott @nodevember? Well, keynotes were all male. That's... the only reason as far as I can see, except for this: [@nexxylove](https://twitter.com/nexxylove/status/772211150108758016): "The reaction that we're seeing to the Nodevember Un-Invitation Incident™ is one born of fear for repercussions of toxic behavior. Full stop." So between this and the pastebin (if I remember correctly), there's indication that Douglas Crockford is toxic... but other than a few *really* bad examples (his monads and gonads talk being the most cited, it seems). People can't find anything toxic. It's been asked for ad nausea, but no concrete examples are given. This brings me to: &gt; I wouldn't worry too much about it. Most of it is just basic politeness and professionalism, and though definition of politeness changes over time, there is nothing "SJW" about it. Politeness *isn't* threats, unless that's changed too. The chance of getting 4 heads in a row is ~6%. Or if we accept a 90% male/female ratio in programming... [that raises to a 65% chance](https://www.google.ca/search?q=(1.8%2F2)). I guess with this new information (because some of this I just learned now) 1. @nexxylove is a toxic SJW 2. I'm toxic - seriously, I'm probably 1/4 toxic. 3. Douglas Crockford is not toxic. I have zero problem with all female/male/trans/alien/microbe as speakers. None. I would definitely have a problem if the lineup was intentional. It's not as far as I can tell, the statistical chance of picking an all male lineup is a coin-toss. Diversity is good. Making threats to get your way is bad, that's toxicity.
London NodeConf 2016. Wednesday the 11th May 2016. After lunch, you and an American man came into the auditorium late and stood at the back. You whispered for hours. Maybe you thought it wasn't an issue because you were at the back, I don't know. But there were at least a dozen other people at the back who had to listen to you talk about all manner of things. I don't have any specific examples; it was a long time ago. If you would like to improve the way you interact with the community, please be more sympathetic, empathetic, and tolerant. Most interactions with other humans aren't battles to be won. People come from all sorts of backgrounds and the way they see the world might be vastly different to how you or I do. But that doesn't mean they are bad people who are actively trying to hurt you. It just means they're different. Stop these witch hunts, please.
It's rather frightening to read this conversation as these people hunt around the Internet to find evidence to support their position. It's sort of a desperate attempt to justify publicly defaming someone. The most damning part of this process is there is literally no evidence that could possibly redeem him. 
Because the *real* community is too busy doing grown-up stuff.
Man i've never liked RoR or Ruby anyway (for irrational reasons) and this doesn't help.

You think words just come up out of nowhere? They're invented by people who see a need for that particular vocabulary because no other word can properly describe what they are trying to say.
FYI: You're committing rape every time you insert a male jumper into a female jumper.
The only one that has said this is Kas Perch, who got him uninvited by a single tweet. Crockford has done absolutely nothing to warrant any of this. But apparantly a medium post written by any random self-absorbed "speaker" is enough these days. Her talks usually revolve around shaming twitter acounts, calling others "human garbage" for not aligning with her thought process. That will be such a relief for those that actually wanted to learn about Javascript at Nodevember.
How does "npm install left-pad" (http://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm) relate to "inclusivity without critical thought"? Node is healthier than it's ever been. The contributor count is up, releases finally have a cadence to them, there's now an LTS schedule, v8 merges are no longer terrifying. Where were you in 2014? Have you already forgotten the quagmire that spawned a hostile fork? What precisely about it is going downhill?
Don't take this the wrong way, but i see it as a very feminine trait, micromanagement. On the opposite spectrum, you see the more masculine "IDGAF, just do work" attitude. I'm not disparaging women... I'm disparaging everybody, men and women (and people who don't identify as men or women but are still biologically a man or woman), who embraces this pathetic ass, totally useless crybaby technique.
One of the problems is that we introduced a lot of crazy people into our world trough platforms like Treehouse or Codeschool. After clicking through "JavaScript for Beginners" they think they "know how to code", go to conferences and bully the veterans.
Eich is regularly invited to speak at conferences, podcasts, and has a startup that is pretty well funded. He's on Twitter a lot talking, discussing, and joking with people. He never left the JavaScript community. Crockford probably doesn't care and he'll be fine—he has a good job at PayPal and most people don't really care about or know what happened recently. Notice how he hasn't even responded or done anything. TJ moved to Go :p Substack doesn't even use a real computer anymore, he's basically a [robot](https://mobile.twitter.com/substack/status/761094390974558208) by now. I rarely see him in the community any more.
&gt; Intent doesn't matter. In communication? Intent, the meaning that the speaker sets out to impart, is almost all that matters. An expert should be denied a platform in favor of lesser speakers to ward off the danger of some attendees misconstruing the word ‘promiscuous’? A conference is better served by speakers who use word I like than people who know their subject? Expertise in the topic is a secondary or tertiary criterion? There seems to be a terminal cart / horse, tail v dog confusion.
You are describing nothing short of a serious mental disorder, and it should be seen as such, diagnosed as such and treated as such. It is a fallacy to believe their mental projections could be cured by limiting your speech or speech in general, which is a dangerous precedent. By catering to it you just make their condition worse and let it affect every facet of social interaction.
It's not circular reasoning. Simply access any data about the man. The main is famous/infamous (ie data can be accessed to ascertain it's validity) that he is a javascript expert https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford
&gt;I hope a lot of people *DTMFA*. FTFY
I tweeted one of the people who complained about Crockford and simply asked if this person had a conversation with Crockford about how he made them feel uncomfortable. As at that time both Nodevember and the people calling him out hadn't revealed any information as to why and the way it was presented on Twitter appeared more of a public shaming than anything constructive. Anyhow, a while later I went to view this person's Twitter profile and they had blocked myself. I put a related tweet out with part it saying "… I guess it's not up for discussion" this person then attempted public oust me by quoting that tweet saying referred to this person an "it". My tweet may have been ambiguously worded but the "it's" (it is) referred to the situation, not the person. It's this overly aggressive attitude based on assumption that irks me the most. Whilst I'm sure this person has had a lot of comments flying their way in the past couple of days. If they were truly caring and wanting to be accepting of everyone, why would this person want to cause me harm before checking what my intentions actually were? I'm absolutely one for supporting people of minority groups, people from unprivileged backgrounds etc. What I will not support is the vile behaviour and tactics that these people employ to get their viewpoint heard. Why is this persons toxic behaviour acceptable but Crockford's isn't?
Close but not quite. Eich made a small donation to a group backing a ballot initiative against gay marriage. He did not make any public statement as far as I know. Donor lists are disclosed publicly, and it was his name being on that list that got him in trouble.
Oh God. Please, no!
&gt; By trying to make the conference more comfortable for a few people who are over reacting they've made it less comfortable for most. Agreed. As soon as I hear such stories happen in a community I start worrying I might say something that someone might interpret as offensive, which makes me super uncomfortable.
Him being an asshole to the point that multiple people said they weren't willing to attend isn't a rational reason to disinvite him from a conference?
Wow, that's a *really* selective reading, followed by a completely ridiculous overstatement of the reaction. The word "gonads" wasn't even the only thing about that *one* example of behavior they didn't want at their conference. And "second coming of Hitler"? They disinvited him from a conference. They didn't indict him for war crimes. Calm down.
I agree american practices are creeping through on some levels, but I think it's like watching a hollywood movie, it still feels foreign... I don't care what it is, but you'll need a little more than whining to get somebody's attention in Europe..
...So what did he actually do?
Wer only know the second part happened. And if the *ridiculously harmless* events cited as reasons for his ban are any indication, he probably didn't do *anything* that justifies being called an asshole for.

Much ado about nothing.
Thank you for the cogent argument, /u/scrotumzz.
ffs don't diminish your great point by whining about downvotes. it's reddit, it costs literally zero anythin to downvote someone.
&gt; he’s basically the closest thing the JavaScript community has to an academic Lots of academics work on JavaScript! Look at the huge number of academic papers on JavaScript in the last few years.
In his defense, I'm starting Crocktober (the afterparty of which will of course be referred to Croktoberfest) which is a Nodevember counter-conf to represent true inclusivity by not banning anyone from speaking. It's a radical idea, let's just hope we don't make anyone feel unsafe.
If you really think that Douglas Crockford needs defense, [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK2r_jmNshM9o-62zTR2toxyRlzrBsSL2) and don't come back until you have the same level of mastery of programming in general and JavaScript in particular. Don't forget to read *JavaScript : the Good Parts* (O'Reilly, 2003). Also his contributions to ES6. We owe much to him in JavaScript having become a mature and respectable language. Let the dogs bark, the caravan shall pass. 
when did IRC start having multiple hash's in channel names?
and aliasing
Unless you are white they will shoot you and your dog. Fuck that!
it's not that they are spineless, it's that they have mortgages to pay and don't want to lose their jobs by arguing with those sjw extremist types.
Well, DevOps is a movement so that should not be a surprise.
Then "gentle" will become a double meaning word that offends this SJW people, and we get to rinse and repeat!
I really hope your hard drive diagnostic tools don't mention any masters or slaves. That would be problematic
This adds nothing to the other post, almost to the point that it could be deemed plagiarism.
Dem fudgin Mexilatinos can't code wurth shit. First well export em in a .mx and den Imma bield a firewall around em and make Node great again! Trump trane WOOT WOOT!!!
I get that. I do. The votes weren't really my point, though. The initial flurry of down votes were indicative of the mentality that I was railing against in my original comment. 
The thing is, there is more than one conference a day in the USA. So yeah, you'll see some stupid drama-queen stories like that, and they'll be promoted to "breaking news" because it creates the narrative that the world is besieged by "Social justice warriors" and "Crybullies". This kind of narrative strokes the ego-penis of a large number of people in the tech community, i have absolutely no idea why. In real life, though, you'll never meet the elusive social justice warrior (wtf, i thought we were litterally invaded by those!). And, statistical anomaly apart, you'll never meet anyone who's been even remotely involved in this kind of stories. Maybe because you're not a drama queen and you spend your days writing code instead of arguing on Twitter. I guess my point is, don't think about it too much, yes drama queens exist but they're nowhere near as predominant as some would have you think, and they'll never impact your life.
This article takes and evaluates the claims against crockford at their face value motives to see if there's any merit to them. And that's good. We need articles that do that. But I also think its important to consider possible ulterior motives that explain how people have continued to glom onto the campaign despite its lack of substance: Crockford is powerful and well-liked and his slight is trivial, and if he can be made an example of over that, doing so sends a powerful message throughout the javascript world: toe the line or you're next. He's a big fish, so catching him would be a big win for them - whether he deserves it looks to be irrelevant in their minds, his reputation and happiness and possible future contributions to the community looks to be irrelevant in their minds.
They're a minority, but they're loud and they have multiple heads on pikes already. I for one have met several of them, and they always sour the mood and get into endless arguments because they cannot agree to disagree. That's the _good_ scenario. The bad one is where networking becomes difficult because they've weaseled their way into events and management.
&gt; can we acknowledge that everyone's experience with the word promiscuity is not the same? I’m upset by the words ‘bit’ and ‘bits.’ What are you going to do for me at a coding conference?
If you have to be "inclusive" instead of being able to say "your idea sucks and doesn't belong here", you accumulate cruft and can never get rid of it.
This stupidity reminds me of Eich being fired from Mozilla.
i thought he got in trouble for saying javascript has shitty rules and implementation for being as important as it is and that the developer community needs to scream about it
I went to nodevember last year. There were a few good talks that were truly helpful, but most of them were people doing show and tell about how they made something in JavaScript without actually explaining any of the hows. I never wouldn't have attended again this year even before they cut one person out of the very small handful of qualified speakers they actually have at this event. 
But they don't sum up to a finite number. They sum up to an infinite number which is representative of that time slice. Mayhe if we think of these things as points in space, I'll better understand the metaphors. So point A is moving at fixed velocity X and point B is moving at X-Y, basically right?
She may have lost that job, but she now has a career as a diversity expert. These people don't go away or lose points for pulling shit like this, it's the exact opposite, they ride the controversy to fame and entrench themselves on somebody else's gravy train.
I wish I had bought a ticket so I could refund it, but after the super low information nodevember I went to last year, I already didn't plan on attending again. There were a few good speakers last year, but most talks were 'show and tell' without any discussion of concepts or code. It was a pep rally. I wouldn't recommend attending.
Opening a dictionary is at least twice as hard as yelling on twitter. &gt; [Promiscuous](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/promiscuous) &gt; &gt; 1) … &gt; &gt; 2) consisting of parts, elements, or individuals of different kinds brought together without order. &gt; &gt; 3) indiscriminate; without discrimination. &gt; &gt; 4) casual; irregular; haphazard.
Did you even read the article? Or did you just get to that sentence so you'd have something to quote?
As much as you may hate it, "cancer" is a descriptive term. A cancer is a tumor that hijacks the body's natural processes and defense mechanisms, creates its own vasculature, leeches off oxygen and nutrients, and tricks the body into letting it grow to its own detriment, until vital functions are terminally compromised. SJW is a label for both a behavior and a clique. It hijacks people's built-in sympathy for victims and dislike of bullies and uses the media (traditional and social) to spread. It will create support networks and reporting channels to gain visibility, and demand that its "diversity consultants" be given equal visibility and authority as established community figures. Using self-created drama as justification, codes of conduct will be put in place, a few witches will be hunted for the sake of "inclusivity" to make them stick, and this will keep happening until the community spirit has been permanently poisoned and the main talent and contributors have slinked off. There's another term to describe it altogether though: a protection racket. *Nice community you got there, would be a shame if someone called you sexist/racist/homophobic.* Do you know how much a Silicon Valley diversity consultant charges per hour? $200 is _low_.
&gt; Your entire ideology is utterly toxic and destroys everything it touches. And lizard-people control the White House. Yes. We. Know.
That's a false dilemma. You can be inclusive and still discuss the merits of code. I don't understand where culture or sensitivity comes into the equation. 
Then again, calling some connectors "male" (because they go into things) and others "female" (because things go into them) sounds problematic (I know, a term that triggers alt-righties) when you think about it; fortunately there are also common terms like "plug" and "socket" or "outlet" or "port".
Numbers only please, other thread(s) for discussion.
Maybe if the name of this mode has any bearing on Python, the devs could re-name that "permissive mode" internally.
Many of the greatest thinkers in history have been really unpleasant people personally and have held all kinds of strange ideas and prejudices. (Though I don't think Crockford comes even remotely close to that.) But imagine if they had all been "shouted down"?
I remember the old days, when "slave drive" had meaning.
There is no significance to "slave" in the world of Git branching, so we should be fine.
Instead of "unisex" try not using gendered language for inanimate objects? Terms like "plug" and "port" or "socket" work fine, and they are often already used alongside "male" and "female".
What is the context for this?
https://atom-morgan.github.io/in-defense-of-douglas-crockford
Nodevember are free to not invite Crockford. I'm free to not attend their conference now, or ever. They have become a product I don't care for, and as such, I won't buy it. 
[Here is a list of other Node JS conferences happening this year](https://github.com/prigara/javascript-conferences). Assuming would've-been-attendees are looking for another conference in the US: * I recommend [*Node.Js Interactive US*](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/node-interactive) (November 29th-December 2nd) for those who can afford it. Attending it is a big feather in your cap, and only costs around 50% more. * For those looking for a conference more in the pricerange (~$400) of Nodevember, [Northeast Javascript conference](http://www.northeastjsconference.com/) (September 15-16) is probably the way to go. Compared to Nodevember, it has denser talks and is a better event in regard to making industry connections. As a nice extra it will probably cost you less to travel to. 
Exactly this. It's quite clear she has cherry picked a phrase out of context and used it as fuel to try to start a start a shit storm about nothing. Dig into the past of any of these fraud morons and you're pretty much guaranteed to find evidence of them contradicting their own "social justice/moral" stance they claim (when it is convenient to get support from a pitchfork mob against something/someone they don't like of course).
Go look at their commit histories. Usually they've done nothing other than remove gendered pronouns out of documentation. 
I can't do anything for you if you can't read. I explained that dominant culture defines the context of words. 
Be like gorhill (creator of uBlock Origin).
You have the correct impression.
Doing it in CSS is an alternative indeed. "It is not as good as your library, but does not need the canvas element" -&gt; do you have something against the &lt;canvas&gt; element ? :)
What do you mean?
I have little time or money to attend such events, and I'm certainly not going to invest those resources in supporting such arbitrary nonsense. Call me when you get serious, nodevember.
I do not a represent any kind of worldview. Everyone is not your friend. This is why we create communities. Persons within a communities are not friends, they are family. Expecting anything from the world will prove to be disappointing. This is why action must be taken. Waiting for family members to be abused by society is not an option. Fuck ideologies. Worshipping stage idols is not more important than uplifting your brothers and sisters. 
Actually they do sum up/ converge to a finite number as long as they decrease fast enough. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series
&gt; I know there's a similar post on the front page You mean https://paulstraw.svbtle.com/crockford ? That article is very confusing and poorly written. I couldn't bring myself to read it. Thanks so much for this one. This whole nodevember fiasco finally made sense to me.
I mostly agree with you. I tend to fall on the side of SJW camp most of the time, but here I'm struggling to see the problem with the majority of what he's being accused of saying. The promiscuity thing, at least in the version of the talk I've heard, is completely innocuous. Now it could be that several earlier versions of the talk were different. Who knows. There's also nothing to see with the "weak map" reference. Everyone hates weak shit. Weak sauce. Weak coffee. However, the balls/gonads/chicharrones/huevos thing is pretty juvenile and *yea* exclusionary. Having struggled with impostor syndrome my whole life and being particularly terrified of functional programming, I can easily imagine not wanting to step anywhere near that talk if I wasn't a dude. And I think you're being a little naive with the terminology. While "gonad" may technically reference to both kinds of organs, that's clearly not what it means in [common parlance](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gonads) (don't stop at the first definition). Likewise with chicharrones. Even if Crockford made up this usage on the spot, it's obvious what it means. Which one even remotely makes sense: "If you have the pork belly, you can learn monads" or "If you have the balls, you can learn monads"?
I think that might be looking too deep, and it's probably just people being lazy. Paul Straw had to do hours of research to get to the point where he could kind of shrug his shoulders, and that's too much work for slacktivists. As social animals, it's easier to just take people's words for it when they say they're being victimized or whatever. If you see some guy grabbing a bag from someone and they call him a thief, it's easy to want to slug the guy and consider yourself a hero, but you really have no idea. The person who cried thief could be the actual thief, and now you've got assault charges on some hapless dude. For my popcorn, I'd love to see some libel suits come out of this nonsense, and some people learning to chill out with their pitchfork trigger words. Context matters. Talking about dog balls awkwardly hanging out in plain view doesn't even have anything to do with gender.
I have nothing against canvas, sometimes it's a lot better than having multiple "hardware accelerated" CSS -layers, which actually run out of available memory and result in flickering
Think my inclusivity radar is way off, could some one explain where the demeaning comment is in the following thread that turned it toxic? https://github.com/tessel/t2-firmware/issues/24#issuecomment-235349872
That one is even newer actually. It was this one http://atom-morgan.github.io/in-defense-of-douglas-crockford that was trending earlier.
It would be nice to have an option for "it's hard to know, maybe (probably) they have access to information we don't, let's give them the benefit of the doubt".
Also check the main sub - couple of threads there that discuss this in length.
I have to agree. I go to work, write code, come home be happy. Never with any clue there was such drama and that the Java script world was being pulled into SJW twitter wars, until all these threads on this sub started showing up on the reddit frontpage. Honestly, the stuff he said, when you combine the fact that he's of the age of someone who enjoys a good "Dad Joke" and the fact that he seems like a typical Dev sort, who's sense of humor tends to be kinda nerdy and a little socially awkward.... combine those two things and it sounds like he was trying to make a joke but just has that Dad/Dev sense of humor and wasn't funny. To those "outraged" by him. I don't get it either. How do they fond the time to even be outraged by things, like, go do your job, write some code and get a hobby.
You know, I thought we (humans) were past the incredible lengths we were going to be politically correct. For the longest time we were striving to ban all talk about the differences in people (black, white, man, woman, whatever). It got so incredibly ridiculous, and then at a certain point people started to realize that we would be better off pointing out our differences and having a laugh about it rather than getting our feather's ruffled over every little thing. Now I see all these social justice movements that are taking it further than it ever has in the past and it's honestly destroying communities. I think Bill and Ted said it best: [Be excellent to each other](http://66.media.tumblr.com/b357791ccad9e506ac76109c3dc97135/tumblr_inline_nto6qsyLf11qdmisx_500.gif).
&gt;You won't listen to a talk because you don't think it will appeal to you? No, I'd listen to anything, but I don't think I would attend a talk if I thought the environment was going to be hostile to people like me. I've been in talks where speakers have, for laughs, taken a giant shit on X, Y, or Z technology choice I've made and it doesn't feel great to be in that room. I'm pretty sure it would be much worse if the jokes were about gender.
I think that's a fair criticism, and I'd definitely agree it probably applies to a lot of the hanger-ons: they don't necessarily have bad intentions, they're just suckered into doing a bad thing. But by who? If they're not to blame because they are being fooled, then there has to be someone doing the fooling. So I don't think I'm looking too deep, but I do think I should narrow my scope. I would agree that it is a bad-apples-rotting-good-ones situation, but there are bad apples. And, given how often these mountain-out-of-molehills "scandals" come up in tech, there are plenty of them.
This kind of overreaction is exactly the problem, and it isn't ours, it is yours. He said "Kindergarden", and here we are discussing rape and physical violence. If that doesn't ring a bell in your common presence it is no wonder you can relate to the likes of Kas Perch. There are people that can't think or perceive a single thing without helplessly drifting off into the associative-unrelated, this is literally what mental *disorder* refers to.
More like voting with your wallet against behaviour you don't think is fair. 
Right after the clearRect line, add: c.beginPath(); Basically, you do clear the canvas. However, you draw an increasingly complex path over it.
Yea I love that anecdote from Gladwell. Point being either way that "weak" has a widely agreed upon negative connotation. Again here, it seems to me like mental gymnastics to ignore the gonads and chicharrones references. If you poll people on the street about what they think those words mean in a sentence the way Crockford used them, I bet 9 out of 10 are going to say "balls". That's what gonads means outside of a scientific context. Having thought about it, I'm pretty sure I understand the chicharrones thing even more (it sounds close to [cojones](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Cojones)). "Thick skin"... yea, a talk with half a dozen references to testicles, and this one is just going to be about thick skin. At best it's plausible deniability. Like when Trump makes a joke about the "2nd admendment people" and Clinton. Anybody in the room knows exactly what he's saying, but there's just enough vagueness for pundits to pretend it was something else. Anyway, I don't think any of this qualifies Crockford for an insta-ban from conferences without an explanation, but at the same time there's no need to be dishonest about what the guy said.
&gt; That "meh" fellow also likens active transphobia with liking/disliking candy. No, he doesn't, not in the way you're implying. He was saying that a person's views on transexuals are as relevant to the Opal project as their views on candy, not that they were equally important to anything else.
Just so i'm getting this right: You will not attend a talk because you **might feel bad** when someone **laughingly** talks shit about **a technology** you use? How about you grow up and aqcuire some mental toughness.
what im saying is most of these people *work* at npm. as in, the built the thing, all up to the CEO (isaac). idk what their current commits are but you cant deny they're endemic
I simply don't get how organisers take solid action on one person's *claim* that lots of people [who?] are uncomfortable about another person. From a slack conversation posted earlier, that seemed to be all the 'evidence' they needed. He's being witch hunted at the moment, IMHO.
Triggered SJW's strike again. Really sad to see nodevember bullied into submission. Reminds me of Brendan Eich fired as CEO of Firefox. Extremist really love censorship at any cost if it goes against their ideology. 
&gt; because some people were intolerant about intolerance When was crockford intolerant? When he made a lighthearted joke about weakmaps? Idiot.
"Overreacting" is what every abuser says to victims. It's possible to be the creator of the environment that you claim not to be a part unwittingly. Nowhere in the article is "Kindergarden" mentioned. Could you cite the use of the word or explain what this has to do with the blog post, "In Defense of Douglas Crockford"? How is kindergarten and mental disorders relevant to this discussion?
Tow the line? That's context I lack. I have found that people in the JavaScript world I have met tend to be polarized on their opinion of Crockford because of the design of jslint. And for that primary reason they think Crockford is useless and needs to be ignored. But just for jslint, and when I ask the folks who don't like him for any other reasons not to like him, I feel like the response I get is essentially "IF HIS LINTER TELLS ME I AM WRONG THEN HE CAN NOT BE RIGHT!"
Twitter isn't a single place, it's just a tool for managing a list of followers. Your specific set of followers entirely determines what your Twitter experience is like. If you're not having a good one, it just means you should try to find different people to follow. (Personally, I follow lots of pixel artists and programming language nerds, and Twitter is pretty delightful for me.)
When the Master/Slave terminology controversy came up, I didn't understand why they didn't add a configurable safeword to the protocol. I guess they didn't want to include the type of people who enjoy that lifestyle into their community.
There's a difference between a) calmly explaining the advantages and disadvantages of a given technology and b) making a small minority of the audience the butt of a joke *just for comedic effect* that has absolutely nothing to do with the presentation topic and with no associated explanation (because it's assumed no one that would be affected by the joke is actually in attendance). Anyway, the technology choice thing was only an analogy, an aid to explain my point, something I've discovered was truly futile because it appears no one in this thread experiences human emotions. Woops. &gt;You're never going to thrive if you're looking for a reason to be offended instead of doing the work to learn and grow as a professional. Thanks for the tip!
At this point we're seeing the opposite happening, js moving to desktop and mobile apps (although not necessarily bringing html and css with it). My guess is that JS will become the defacto standard for all UI development in the future.
They actually do have leverage because person C could claim "the organizers refuse to create an inclusive environment" which is the scarlet letter of software communities these days. There are people who know this and have an axe to grind with anyone who doesn't toe the line of social justice, especially white males. Don't like someone who is going to be on a panel with you, but they haven't done anything specifically egregious? Just say "they make me feel uncomfortable" and if you're a woman or a "person of color" then you'll probably get your way even if that person is Douglas Fucking Crockford. It's gross.
Nodevember slack pastebin: http://pastebin.com/3mQc7DfG Decide for yourself if they just want to build a "safe place" :) Poor guys, they will learn it in the hard way that supporting specific groups does not mean to shut the windows to protect them from the sunlight. ( I actually lost it at the line where someone says that two people's opinion is representative :D )
&gt; Even if Crockford made up this usage on the spot, it's obvious what it means. Which one even remotely makes sense: "If you have the pork belly, you can learn monads" or "If you have the balls, you can learn monads"? When you put it like that, it looks like he was trying to say "If you have the guts, you can learn monads". 
Looks like you guys are beginning to realize what code-of-conducts are really about. Boycott is fine, but it is also very effective to contact their sponsors, and explain why supporting Nodevember is a bad idea, and may harm their own brand.
Kindergarten, gonad, promiscuity and weakmap were the trigger terms attributed to his dismissal. The mental apparatus, at any time, compares heaps of information, by definition this is called "rationale", a *ratio* is being defined as a relation between one information to another. This is how we see and know things in context to other things, experiences, etc. Mental disorder describes a condition in which ratio become ir-rational, meaning people tend to make abnormal or unrelated connections or associations. Do you see yourself rambling on about rape, victim abuse and worse, though no one here gave you the slightest reason to do so?
It's funny too... They all owe their career to him in one way or another.
&gt; I think not attending a talk due to a hostile environment is a reasonable, "grown up" choice. That is true but this isn't a hostile envorinment, he's not singling you out as an individual. He's talking about a technology. If I, as a ginger, would take offense to every ginger-joke i heard i'd be goddamn miserable... but growing up thaught me to either ignore it or laugh if it's a good one. And even if i took offense i wouldn't go crying about it. The world really needs to toughen up again and women, minorities and LGBT's crying about inequality only makes them look weak to me.
If you were going just to see Crockford then you should had reconsider going to the conference before. Leaving aside if they acted wrong or not, going for boycotting them is like firing you for having a bug in your code. Show some fucking empathy for conference organizers who gain 0$ from their events.
Would you mind linking to this?
The problem is a misrepresentation of inclusion as liberty, which is a colossal mistake. Liberty is about not silencing a minority, which often means allowing upsetting hateful communications that are largely disagreeable. Advancing liberty implies allowing more hate speech, which is absolutely not about eliminating sadness or discomfort. Read more on liberty here (especially the second chapter): http://www.utilitarianism.com/ol/one.html Inclusivity is a process for eliminating specifically defined forms of discrimination, such as *protected classes* and *affirmative action*. This also has absolutely nothing to do with eliminating sadness or discomfort. Inclusivity can differ from liberty where certain expressions violate anti-discrimination measures as defined by some governing inclusion rule. This social justice warrior madness has nothing to do with inclusion or liberty. It is purely about [sympathy](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/sympathy?s=t), which is different from [empathy](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/empathy?s=t). Instead of producing anything of use or value they form social communities to complain about things that impose sadness. In other words, it is a first world problem of entitled people defining themselves through activism rather than substance fought with censorship.
Webassembly will help with the lowlevel, i doubt it will replace JS, HTML and CSS. We have thrown things like QT, GTK and XAML out of our stack and use Node/Electron now with React and Vue running the frontend. No complaints. Lots of the companies we deal with go a similar path, or at least evaluate it. 
What's the story? I'm out of the loop.
I don't have a Twitter account and I see tons of garbage from it by following Reddit links
The first one I don't even understand. How does him ripping on a design decision and name make someone uncomfortable? I mean he even says immediately afterward it is good thing! I'd love to hear how his comments can be construed as "slut-shaming". I am genuinely interested in a logical, well-reasoned, not-totally-out-there explanation. The *only* sentence in the realm of "slut-shaming" I could come up with in the narrative of his speech is when he said "we can have committed relationships between people as well as between companies". Which taken totally out of context, sure it can appear to be slut-shaming. But within the context of his speech, he is talking about online relationships (and not in the romantic way, but in a security way). Now if you're so sensitive that you become uncomfortable when someone calls your idea stupid, boy is life going to be rough for you. Learn to take the feedback and ask questions as to *why* that person thinks it is stupid. A LOT (read: most) people are not good at providing constructive criticism without help/additional poking/probing. 
This is absolutely ridiculous, thank god i'm not part of this bullshit SJW generation.
This is an outrage! Crockford should take JavaScript back from the community!
Hehe. Yeah there are a lot of little bugs like that, as it still just a one-man project I've spent a few hours on. :)
We should establish a government branch to promote the use of approved vocabulary! Call it the Ministry of Truth. And we can call our new language Newspeak! 
The dongle joke was definitely in poor taste and probably shouldn't just slide if she was offended but it could have been handled privately or if she didn't want the confrontation then notifying an organizer.
sjws love hush hush behind the door secretive stuff. They are the most uninclusive people you'd ever meet, you have pass series of 'character tests' to prove to be ideologically stable to inculded in their secret cabal where they decide who is to be condemeded and how. While its easy to be mad at the faces of this cabal like Emily rose, don't forget all the enablers and cabal leadership. They always choose someone hateable and naive like Emily as the face of their persecution where they eventually get burnt out and drop out( see: adria richards) only to be replaced by someone new .
What does "rational" mean to you? Not wanting to spend time around someone who's condescending and makes people feel bad sounds extremely rational to me.
They are deep in the community and run stuff like npm.
I actually just received the same question via email. All I meant by pointing that out is “hanging out there like a pair of dog balls” refers specifically to the male anatomy. I certainly don’t find it offensive myself, but do think that it’s not really appropriate for the situation, and can understand how others might find it off-putting. Mostly, I was just trying to be as through as possible. 
Really it's the SJW's that are being sexist and "slut-shaming" by arguing that promiscuity has negative connotations. If promiscuity is okay then there should be no problem using it in a talk. 
What's with "Mx. Perch"? What's Mx? If we really want to go after the inconsistencies and the biases of the English language, why don't they present it that way? I would also vote for Ms for everything. Get rid of Mrs. Mx is weird. I hope that's not just a typo :-). Edit: After Paul Straw's response, I googled it (which I should have started with). Apparently, it's not a marriage neutral honorific for women, but a gender neutral honorific for everybody. TIL. 
Crabs in a bucket are all equal. 
Eh I guess but I mean, he WAS uninvited so someone at Nodevember definitely listened
I know. And I disagree with the entire premise of the article. Someone else can easily go through those same quotes and reach the opposite conclusion, because opinions like this are completely fucking arbitrary and subjective and have absolutely nothing to do with Javascript or computer science. Its as if there were a group of radical vegans who go around putting pressure on conference organisers to uninvite speakers based on whether or not they have ever eaten meat. It doesn't matter if another radical vegan then goes on to write an article saying "Actually, I don't think he did eat meat so I don't know why he was banned" - its still coming from within the same ideological framework that its okay to go after and silence people that you disagree with, just that this particular crackpot can't find sufficient reason to go about banning, suppressing and silencing someone that doesn't share their worldview in this particular instance.
It's bigger than just this one event though, it's part of a pattern at programming conferences I've seen, starting with the PyCon dongle incident, lambdaconf and now this (and all sorts of other stuff, obv). Just because you've not noticed a pattern developing doesn't make everyone else drama-seeking teenagers.
Isn't that... Exactly what's happening though, maybe just in a not-delicate way?
The case of Brendan Eich and Crockford are not comparable. Speaking at a conference for an hour and representing and leading an organization for years are clearly not in the same league of consideration.
He's a speaker, not your personal entertainer shadow paid for talking to you 24/7. If you avoid his talk, you'll probably not even hear his voice once the whole time you're there. And those who want to speak with him can do that.
Yes but you get socks with a cute bear if you fix something.
That's actually a funny point. We need to start a campaign asking the people against Crockford to *really* commit by only using XML. 
this stuff is endemic to the node community tbh, even meetups where i live
Very good point, now I get you. However, there always is a “asshole line” beyond which people become unwelcome. And it's of course arbitrary. Of course it's a line more people can agree on, and you'll have to do quite a bit to cross it, but it exists all the same.
&gt; I find that completely unacceptable and offensive, and now I demand attention and sympathy for being exposed to something that I don't like, and I demand that you be subjected to a witchhunt for having offended me, and your career should be destroyed. I agree with you, despite the downvotes, for the record. I think this entire thing is insane.
But neither is Crockford. 
He invented JSON? Man, I do owe my recent stuff to him. Consuming APIs is the shit! 
&gt; [9:56] Nodevember doesn't owe anyone anything They invited the guy and he accepted. Even if they feel they had to uninvite him, they should have shown some respect. Uninviting him like that on twitter was really disgusting.
&gt; Persons within a communities are not friends, they are family. We have vastly different definitions of family if we're talking about communities such as the javascript development community. &gt; Waiting for family members to be abused by society is not an option. You're right, having this mindset is crazy. Expecting that they will **necessarily** be abused is just as crazy. These are things completely and entirely out of your control. Dwell on other things, things within your control. &gt; Fuck ideologies. This is very appealing on the surface, but semantically meaningless. It's very similar to saying: *fuck colors*. You're just expressing frustration at the tools we use to describe things. In the first case: ways of thinking, in the second case: objects around us. Both these things, as it turns out, are quite valuable if we want to have meaningful discussion on a topic. &gt; Worshipping stage idols is not more important than uplifting your brothers and sisters. I really don't know what stage idols you're referring or how anything I've said could be construed to mean anything even remotely relating to idolatry. I have two sisters and I love them very much. They have never required uplifting from myself, or anyone else to function in society. They are more than capable of standing on their own two feet and I'm very glad of that fact. Thinking of random JS devs as if they were my "brothers and sisters" would really only be disingenuous. I'm happy to show civility to anyone I meet, but not when it conflicts with reason. Moreover that civility certainly doesn't extend to the exclusion of one individual or group to the benefit of others, e.g. Mr. Crockford being maligned and publicly shamed.
&gt;But, again, being social animals, once you've rallied support, even if you look back and are like, "Oh, I guess I overreacted," it's really hard to take it back because you make your supporters look foolish as well. What are we arguing about right now? I thought we were arguing about whether there were people who were being intentionally dishonest. But here you are admitting that they are, to advance some other different point that I'm not clear on what it is: Are you suggesting this makes it somehow more okay to double down on trying to mess up the career of something for no good reason? The morality of this is really not about what's good for the people attacking Crockford or what they'd individually like most. It's wrong to try to fuck up someone's career on a whim, full stop, and it's even worse to continue when it's obvious your original justifications were misguided. It's inexcusable. It's not okay. They were wrong things to do. &gt;I don't think it's like some insidious plot Neither do I, I never suggested this was a result of coordination. But I also don't think that we need to start from an axiom that people who go around on baseless politically-charged witch hunts against strangers' careers in the name of safety and comfort are well-meaning people without any trace of a political axe to grind.
Exactly! The npm registry is all right, but the npm client has gotten so bad it's practically unusable.
&gt; It's unfair that event planners try to make an event enjoyable by as many people as possible? I'll just exclude blacks from my dinner party because all my friends are racists. That falls under the 'fair' category by your definition, right? &gt; Jeez, what a sensitive bunch of crybabies you boys are. Do you not even care that a guy who did nothing wrong is being hung up for inane shit because of some cultish fuckwits? I have too much integrity to not get pissed, sorry if you don't share the sentiment. 
So he invented json - the bad parts? (I jest)
Do you think I believe this is the reaction you had to reading my comment? Come back to reality, retard. 
I tried using your code as well, doesn't help. The console throws me [this error](http://imgur.com/a/WOHrJ). I'm using Postman, just like selecting GET/POST, I choose DELETE and it throws me [this error](http://imgur.com/a/0oYn6). Any idea regarding the solution? Edit: the GET/POST/PUT operations don't cause any error
That's because he is one. *someannoyingword*
&gt; what a bunch of drama about people incapable of handling the opinions of someone else. \*cough\*irony\*cough\*
&gt; However, I think this seems like an occasion where I need stateful functions to reduce code duplication for myself and the user of the code The functions you presented in your example are not "stateful" as I've been using the term because they don't mutate some internal state with every function call (as far as I can tell). What you really want in this case is simply a closure, as was pointed out by [rosswarren](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/50vdc1/classes_or_module_of_functions/d77a2ma). 
Your first mistake is applying logic here. 
&gt; Do you actually think I believe this is the reaction you had to reading my comment? Oh hunny, it's pretty clear I don't care at all what you believe. You guys having a tantrum over this whole issue is just precious. :)
Not the least bit interested going to that event anymore. It's not just about him being uninvited. It's about them making that decision without any evidence against Crockford.
I wish all SJW boycotted all the things I like, just so I wouldn't have to be in the same room as any of them.
Your personality seems like a complete charade; do you actually communicate like this unironically? 
So like, when do these people find time to, you know... write code? I mean, I've been to some conferences and talks in the past, some talks are ok, but most are bullshit. There's those "devangelists" as you call them up there, talking about foundational or very niche stuff that might help someone working on their blog or something, but you can tell they've never written a large scale enterprise application in their life and would be baffled by the sort of problems the developers who do, face daily.
I think the latter half of that thread really gets to the issue, which is that Crockford is a notoriously rude, crude and judgemental asshole. Also, if you don't understand why such a person, in a keynote address, talking about some people not having the balls to do something right--well, you're a dude. That said this was handled spectacularly poorly and I'm deeply unimpressed with the organizers. Difficult to imagine that they didn't know what they were getting when they invited Crockford, and so too the people who bought tickets or signed up to speak after he was announced. So the whole thing looks like a panicked reaction and a clumsily retconned justification. The elevated world of Javascript luminaries appears to be a constant maelstrom of shitty attitudes and amateur politics and I'm delighted not to be anywhere near it. EDIT: Interested to know the reason for the downvotes without comments. Reddit is better when you don't user the downvote as the "I disagree" button.
I can't seem to figure what part of these quotes are actually offensive to anyone in any way 
It wasn't millennials who decided that everyone gets a trophy. It was their parents and grandparents. The kids were not fooled.
yes, that's one benefit. you don't have to listen to them cry bully.
It's not. They are very PC/SJW oriented.
OK, you're right. They literally treated him like Hitler.
I know about passing through callbacks and all that, this isn't the first time I'm doing this. I know exactly how it works, have been doing it for years boet. I'm just sick of doing it like that.
I know early how callbacks work. I've been doing this for years. I'm just sick of doing it this way and was looking for a better way to do it. I know that asynchronous code works like this, but I don't want it to be asynchronous, there's just no point in it being asynchronous in my current situation. 
&gt;Your personality seems like a complete charade; do you actually communicate like this unironically? This right here, the biggest gold nugget in the entire thread. Sweetheart, you've made my day. Never change darlin. :)
SJWs have infiltrated the JS community and have for some while. It reminds me of the irc #javascript channel on freenode.net where saying 'hey guys' to the room is forbidden because it's not 'gender inclusive'. Instead you must use the greeting of 'Hello women, men, transgendered and non-gendered people (or entities)' /s.
The main problem is that they did invite him. They invited him, used his name to garner interest and then very publicly ditched him for seemingly no real reason. Had they never invited him in the first place there would be no issue. Had they not publicly barred him there would be no issue aside from a couple of people who would have had to make a decision about whether they wanted to attend our not. It of the three options nodevember chose the worst, by a large margin.
Yes, but the problem is that one clique is trying to destroy the other cliques because they don't meet their specific demands for social rules. That's bad. What's much, much better is to simply identify bad behaviors that all of the cliques can generally agree is unacceptable, rather than ostracizing people who are already contributing members of the community. It's a matter of degree and method.
Sadly, the official Crocktober account was also blocked by @nexxylove. Also @getify, who has been sympathizing with Crockford's victims.

Hi /u/docbloodmoney, please refrain from personal attacks. Thanks.
Used frequently in /r/tumblrinaction
Whatever your take is on the "everyone gets a trophy" angle I don't think this is the same thing. "Pointing out social injustice" has been something that has been put up on a pedestal in the last decades (rightfully so). So .. if you engage in it, you present yourself as "morally elevated". You are "advanced". You are always "on the right side". You don't even need to think about it. Just point out something that could make someone else feel bad. How could that possibly not be a good thing? How could you possibly not be a noble person for doing that? (Regardless of the fact that you might have stolen money out of grandma's wallet last week.) So .. for people who don't really have anything else that they can hook their identity on, they can just jump on that "social justice" boat. They can put themselves in the same lineage as Ghandi and MLK. They are not just some "nobody". They are a *champion*. The world is better because they exist. And you .. if you don't agree with them and think like them .. are part of what makes the world bad. Obviously. And it's kind of an untouchable position, they way they have it set up. After all .. nobody can ever be "standing up too much for the little guy", right? Nobody can ever be "too much on the side of the underdog". You can never be accused of "wanting fairness too much". And sure there is an element of bullying in it. And that's exactly what draws some people to it. Because these are, you know, not the kind of people who normally get to feel what it is like to be "over" someone else. They don't normally get to feel "powerful". But here is a weapon they now have that can *hurt* people. They can get *other* people in trouble. They can turn other people into "outcasts". Now they can feel what it is like to be powerful.
But every generation try to change the world. Without this, we'd still be chemically castrating gay men and beating up women who wear pants. Having said that, I will cede that when young people reach maturity in an age of increased competition for resources, you get things like ISIS and the IRA, and these days the competition for mindshare among the New Media leads to the shrillest voices being the only ones heard clearly over the din. ...But, to be frank, Crockford's a pretty shrill voice himself. Has he contributed? Yes, we've got JSON, thanks. Does JSON have comments? No. Well, *fuck you, Crockford*. Again, I'm a bit surprised that suddenly everyone's pro-Crockford when before these tweets, they were sick of Crockford's orthodoxies. Add to that reddit's general whiff of sexism (/r/all clearly shows the gender bias in reddit's userbase), and I'm more sympathetic to nodevember's organizers. Do I agree with them? *...no?* But then perhaps my opinion of The Node Ecosystem colors my view, as someone a whole generation older than the people organizing it, that Node and NPM really show how [to set the wayback machine to 1997] ESR's "Bazaar" gets blown away in the storm, while the planned-economy Cathedral stands. I think they're all nuts, but I also think the nodevember folk have a right to decide what that means to them. 
My apologies.
&gt; Same thing happened to Vox Day. From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_Day) &gt;Day responded by denying her accusation and calling her "an educated, but ignorant half-savage, with little more understanding of what it took to build a new literature by 'a bunch of beardy old middle-class middle-American guys' than an illiterate Igbotu tribesman has of how to build a jet engine....' Yeaaah, maybe not exactly the same thing...
The [nodevember's official statement](http://nodevember.org/statement.html) still fails to convey something meaningful, but "at least" they are allowing people to request a refund.
Have you people never heard of Dr. Axel Rauschmayer??? (http://www.2ality.com)
Hi /u/hasharray, I'm removing this as I feel it's too far removed from /r/javascript. The current debate is already toeing that line, but this thread explicitly requests no discussion -- which defeats the purpose of this subreddit. If you want to poll the audience, please use some other avenue (Twitter, perhaps). Thanks for your understanding. 
At your digression /u/kenman
Boy, for someone with the username "Hitler", you sure don't know much about German names.
But the angry mob is the same.
In heinsight, this post should probably just have been a comment.
No, I think you're spot on here. From the outside looking in, I'm aware of at least some people involved in social justice who've argued against the name and shame, let's get people fired extremism, and found that they could do nothing but just walk away. Righteousness is always armor against criticism, but it has a particularly effective Teflon coating for some social justice people.
Prbly cos Hitler was not German
I don't understand why Nodevember even had to disclose why they removed Crockford. Just say he won't be speaking and leave it at that. I worked at the Hollywood Bowl for a summer and one of the artists set to perform was too paranoid to perform after dropping some acid. We just said that the person was unable to make it and moved on. No need to air private shit in public.
This. I hadn't heard of nodevember until today with these threads. What's this all about anyway?
Stupid illiterate people don't understand that 'promiscuity' is not gendered. It can be, and often is, used in reference to men. Though it is usually used in a sexual context, it often is used to refer to any sort of indiscriminate association. It is only through extensive reading that people become familiar with the full range of use and meaning of words. The illiterates must not be allowed to use their ignorance to suppress full use of the language.
Lambdaconf fell under criticism for inviting an open white supremacist to speak. That was a whole other league and the outrage was 100℅ justified.
&gt; Promiscuous The first definition isn't inherently sexual either. &gt; 1) *characterized by or involving indiscriminate mingling or association*, especially having sexual relations with a number of partners on a casual basis. I think the sexual connotation of the word has overtaken the actual semantic meaning of the word in recent years. Meanwhile, Crockford is over 60 and might not have the same experience of the word. Now to digress*, I think an overlooked facet of this conversation, is the implicit ageism. Crockford is of a different generation, and his attitude and choice of words reflect that. Is age/generation not another type of diversity? Are there any other speakers over 60? 50? *NOTE: My apologies in advance, as this isn't even relevant to your post. I just couldn't stop myself.
Keep telling yourself that sugar. :)
Cool, thanks Hitler.
I think the issue was more nuanced than how you present it, but regardless, in neither case was there any evidence that the individual in question was going to give anything other than an on-topic technical talk. I think that it's a very dangerous path to take excluding valid contributions from people who hold opinions we disagree with or who speak in ways we find displeasing. I think the lambdaconf organizers did an excellent job at handling their situation, ensuring a safe environment for everyone while also ensuring that they weren't excluding someone who was going to make a meaningful contribution on the basis of "unapproved thinking". Furthermore, there is a long-standing tradition of people publishing controversial works under pseudonym. The person in question was in fact _not_ an open white supremacist (going to leave the second half of that unexamined here). He wrote under a pseudonym and was doxxed. He chose to separate his professional persona from his "philosophical" one and I think that unless the content he's publishing is illegal, we should respect a person's capacity to remain professional in a professional setting. The free flow of ideas requires accommodation of very different viewpoints, and unless a person is advocating violence or engaging in verbal abuse, I think it's best to give people a wide latitude in their ideas and communication. I hate to see what would happen if a Software Engineer who was also a Standup Comedian got into the SJW crosshairs. A lot of standup comedians make really offensive jokes about gender or racial issues that don't necessarily make the comedian a racist or sexist person. It's important to be able to explore the darker sides of humanity freely, and shutting people down for doing so is not helping anyone.
I can't get what you saying ?
&gt; hey could get that person booted from the conference No, it's far worse than that. Any conference Crockford is invited to speak for will get messages demanding to ban him. Even if those conference organizers aren't as stupid as those from Nodevember, then those organizers will receive the same or worse treatment as Crockford did. And then the next conference won't make that same "mistake" again. And this is not limited to conferences. You can be sure, that those sociopaths will follow that person around. Oh, he wrote a book? Better tell that publisher you will tell everyone how they promote a book from a &lt;long list of accusations&gt; if they don't remove his books. 
Are you saying that bro-culture isn't a thing that needs to go away? 
These type of bullying really need to backfire spectacularly, so that people can stop doing it.
I wouldn’t conflate the technology with the people who use the technology. Twitter is just a platform, your problem is with the people you see on Twitter. It’s easy to have a great time with Twitter, but like there is inane drama in real life so too there is inane drama on Twitter, constantly.
I'm sick and tired of this recent uprise of hypersensitive, self-righteous SJWs who see offence, bigotry and sexism everywhere, then proceed to throw tantrums on social media, looking for uproar, praise and approval, when most of the times others end up obliging to their "demands" for fear of being called offensive, bigots or sexists themselves. I'm all-in for diversity and inclusion, but these two ladies' actions and demands do a very weak favour to the cause they are supposedly standing for. It's like this idiotic vocal-fry girl who was made famous last week for shaming a Lyft driver (while filming it) for having a Hawaiian bobble-head in his dashboard: It just *reeks* of attention-whoring and self-righteousness.
No, you see, 'coz hypocrisy runs rife in the SJW communities......
He isn't even unpleasant. I watched the videos that they seem to be complaining about.
I'm boycotting boycots in the javascript community. Join me! There are dozens of us!
You can use for example http://numeraljs.com
Not the most helpful of comments, but try searching on Codepen.io, there's a lot of content there that can show you how to get the effect you want.
&gt; We are in over our heads. The conference has grown to something we never anticipated. Bullshit. I don't buy it. You don't take people's money and then claim you don't know what you are doing. 
&gt;Definitions of family can vary. Drop semantics and digging for a meaning just for a moment and try to think about the outcome of the actions that have come to pass. Okay. An expert in his field was invited to share his knowledge and expertise, then uninvited in a public and humiliating way for vague and unspecified reasons as a direct or indirect result of what I perceive as whining/crybullying. That's what I've come to pass thus far. &gt;I do not welcome ideologies to pollute discussion. I don't really know what this means. I don't think you really know what this means either. &gt; I also don't welcome status to discussion either, because if it weren't Douglas, the backlash wouldn't be this much. Maybe the backlash wouldn't be this much, I'd hope it would. You act as if he's done something wrong, I haven't seen that he has. I haven't seen any quotes from him telling dick jokes. And so what if he did? It's a joke. If it's not funny, don't laugh. No reason to not include a great developer from sharing his expertise. And certainly not a reason to lambast the guy. &gt;What matters is that we don't have childish penis jokes at technical events. Why does this matter? As long as the speaker presents an interesting talk and sheds some light on some aspect of development, they can make all the dick jokes or dad jokes or poop jokes they want. Is this really important in any way? If it is, I have yet to hear any convincing argument in support of that notion. 
Feeling this will be voted into oblivion, so I'll point out the obvious things. - There is no narrative - English seems to be an issue - Very little information - Most of it seems misinformed
I'm not boycotting it because I literally had no idea what it was and never planned to go. It's just a conference! Who cares? Nodevember organizers overreacted in the most irritating way, and the overreaction to their overreaction is just as irritating. Everyone complaining about immature entitled millennials should lead by example and maturely react to this news without angry rants on sjw's or political correctness, because again it's just a stupid conference. 
Saved for later reference! ;)
I like his blog, it's one of the few authoritative sources on js I really trust.
The dogballs. Believe me, I've tried.
&gt;&gt; What things has Mr. Crockford done that make you so concerned about his presence? &gt; &gt; I'm not willing to go into any further details than what I have already provided already on Twitter. Relevant individuals are aware of specific issues, and are addressing them with Crockford individually as well as with conference organizers. Mh... You are basically telling him he is not a *relevant* enough *individual* to deserve you giving him an answer to his question. Very inclusive. Also, going on some pretty wild assumption about /u/simonoforbonne here, I'd say that -- from the things he mentions in his comment (the purge his family went through, coming from a cultural and religious minority etc) -- he is Jewish. So congratulations, for being anti-Semite too.
Dude.. what. in. the. actual. fuck. I googled that bobble head situation after I read your comment. Cringe as fuck.. people drawn to this type of behavior have deep rooted psychological problems and need to seek professional help. She would have found just about anything he said or did to take a position against him before the end of that ride. She is not a feminist nor interested in equality.. just wields it as a tool to victimize herself to be more comfortable in her misery. Sickening. If she was offended and had the intent to change his position on the matter of "Bobble Head's".. what good would such an approach do? You don't change someones position with an onslaught of negative stimulation. Calling them names, attempting to shame them.. so ignorant. If something bothers you in this world and you want to make a difference than do that, but this "SJW" shit, fuck the crap out of you.. go get help. Medical help. You are not a victim, you just lack depth. You have deep rooted issues and you are a cancer to society. Period.
&gt; going for boycotting them is like firing you for having a bug in your code. No, it's like not going on a 2nd date because your date was rude to a server. &gt; Show some fucking empathy for conference organizers who gain 0$ from their events. It was their choice. It was also their choice to cave into whining and have a development conference focused on feelings rather than development. I'm a firm believer that choices should and do have consequences, life and the rest of the dev community seem to be pretty unanimous in their agreement with me on this. I understand that it's hard when you make a bad decision; I've made many myself! I also understand that this is the only way we can learn and grow both as people and as organizations. I'm very glad that the organizers have been given this opportunity to learn!
&gt;people choose to be offended for their own satisfaction You are literally doing this right now. Yes they overreacted. Your overreaction to their overreaction is just as irritating. It's just a stupid conference, nobody compared anyone to hitler.
My point exactly. Why won't people just accept Crockford as he is and learn from his talks whatever is applicable to JavaScript. (Also, if Crockford’s absence is a done deal, why won't people just accept his absence and learn whatever is applicable to JavaScript from other speakers?)
Yep. Mute is also a great tool.
Because this isn't about tolerance, it's about punishing those that disagree with you. 
Because from an outsider who sees you get the job. One that I assume was your dream job. And then to see you leave it rather abruptly in the wake of the sea of activists coming for your head. It felt like you were ousted for political disagreements. Official story or otherwise. Especially when for some time after leaving you were relatively dark and didn't accept another position from within the organization. I saw a great deal of people taking sides around this time as to whether to support you or not. From what I saw. The community was divided. I suppose I assumed that went further into Mozilla proper than I probably should have. My apologies for assuming more than I should have. As an aside. I'm still quite sad about the whole thing. I was rather vocal about supporting you in the position. I'm incredibly disappointed that California law made the donation public. As I'm still not convinced the issue should have mattered. I was quite excited to see what became of Mozilla under your leadership. I've been following your work and career for as long as I've done software development professionally(~2 years). Ever since I learned JavaScript and heard you on JavaScript Jabber. I'll make an explicit point to not speak so flippantly about you in the future. And thanks for engaging with me in the community. Even if I wish It were under very different circumstances. PS. Brave is awesome. 
wait, you have been doing this for years? how have you been able to maintain employment doing this? edit: nevermind, I thought you were saying you have been doing this avoiding callbacks thing for years and were sick of doing it this way You could learn to use promises, and if you want to go even further then learn some esnext and use async/await with your promises.
I would so love to see a tripping Crockford give a talk about JavaScript.
I don't know these days which way is up and if so why isn't it. One person publicly accuses another of being an exclusionary bigot, for such heinous things as, in a private conversation no less, saying something along the lines, "well as the day is getting on the presentations are getting stupider". There was a time when actively and publicly attempting to destroy someone's reputation and livelihood required evidence far, far stronger than, at best, a conversational faux pas. Maybe there is something deep in the closet there yet to come out. Things so dark, no one as of yet will say them. But right now, all I'm seeing is a person being destroyed by a bunch of folks without evidence or consequence, for no other reason then I guess they can. On the other hand, if the facts come out as true, a strongly damning statement impacting his career and standing. https://twitter.com/nexxylove/status/771503661956501504 
It's part of a growing pattern of accommodating safe-space crybabies that I think is counterproductive to actual diversity. Obviously comparisons to hitler are not literal... if you're not able to comprehend a facetious comparison, that's your own issue.
TIL no updates in almost 8 months means "abandoned." Anyway, I'll try whipping up an implementation (assuming, of course, that no property key has `.` in it and no key is literally `*`): // assume that dotHelper is an object dotHelper.find = function find(obj, str) { 'use strict'; if (typeof obj === 'undefined' || obj === null) return [obj]; var path = String(str).split('.'), len = path.length, res = [], hasOwn = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty, p, n, s; if (!path.length) return [obj]; while (path.length) { p = path.shift(); if (!p) continue; s = path.join('.'); if (p === '*') { for (n in obj) { if (hasOwn.call(obj, n)) res.concat(find(obj[n], s)); } } else { if (hasOwn.call(obj, p)) res.concat(find(obj[p], s)); } } return res; }; Okay, this isn't quite right; maybe I'll update this post to make it work properly, but the idea is to remove all empty spaces from the path, and then to do something special once you've gotten to the end of the path.
I know right? Of all the people! The whole thing does seem very witch-hunty. And it's not even like they said "Hey you were using some language that maybe is a little problematic. You should watch out for that." They just went right for the jugular. Scary.
&gt; If you want to be a nice person like you said, maybe you should respect people's choices to identify with a different gender when in the end it doesn't affect you in any imaginable way? Agreed, yet it's not my obligation to coddle a person I don't know when I'm just having a casual conversation. If someone specifically asks me to call them by a certain title or "gender identifier", sure I'll do it, but please don't expect me to memorize the hundreds of fringe-terms that have spawned from tumblr and socjus-circles that nobody actually knows about.
&gt; Most of it seems misinformed can you please tell where ?
But "having the guts" to learn something difficult makes sense. "having literal testicles" to learn something makes no sense whatsoever. Why would someone think actual testicles are necessary? If we're supposed to be putting in effort to consider everyone's possible interpretation of every word, even if that interpretation requires disregarding every shred of logic and context, why not give the speaker the benefit of the doubt? Why is the very mention of any word with a possible non gender neutral meaning demonized in the first place? What about other romantic languages with gender baked into every sentence? Should we ban Latino speakers because they might say a masculine word, since malicious intent is in no way a prerequisite for taking personal offense? 
Anyways, I really don't think someone like Douglas Crockford really gives a shit. Any tech conference should be a place where people talk about the technology and innovations and prospects, not a place for SJWs to make their Gay Elsa propaganda.
I was just in an argument with someone who said black people can't be racist against whites because racism is the systematic cultural suppression of another race. So white people can be racist, but black people can't be. And I understand the point she was making and sure there is something to it .. but that "something" is not contained in the definition of the word "racist". It would mean that if a black guy and a native indian guy both stood together and both said "black people are stupid and smell funny" the white guy would be being a racist, but the native guy would be being something else, since natives aren't part of the "system" that disadvantages blacks. 
You can always decide not going to a 2nd date based on whatever the other person does, but starting a movement for people to stop dating the other person based on what you dislike seems childish.
&gt;an event enjoyable by as many people as possible? I think the people boycotting are doing so because they find environments such as nodevember unenjoyable.
On the one hand, I agree with that Medium post and with the notion that Crockford, as disagreeable as he is, isn't a bigot. On the other, your cheap shot at the "unicorn hair" types led me to suspect the article was a bad-faith hack-job from some alt-rightie, and the fact that [you cross-posted this on KotakuInAction](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/512yrf/socjus_inclusivity_is_a_joke/) increases my suspicion. You have no online presence as "Hash Array" before about June 2016, so I don't know about any history you may or may not have with those agitating hatemongers. It's frustrating when the alt-right seems to be in the right for once.
The laughs you hear are at you, not with you.
This is embarrassing.
Sadly they can't always just be ignored.
Thanks, much appreciated. I suppose I should write that book in a year or two (if I have time!).
This week I made [cybershrek](https://substack.neocities.org/cybershrek/) and [shrekvr](https://substack.neocities.org/cybershrek/vr.html) for [shrekfest](http://the3gi.com/shrekfest). I also made this eye of providence: https://substack.neocities.org/eye.html Next I want to write a cosmic background shader.
I saw this whole SJW take over starting about a few years ago and decided that I'd be leaving programming as a career and slowy start phasing out new node.js client work. That, and the ES6 changes that make code unreadable (don't get me wrong, some of the ES6 changes are great), and Angular 2 move to typescript, just didn't make things fun. Why is it I have to keep re-learning things every 3 months from scratch and I can't just program? On top of that, for no reason, be called a racist, homophobic, etc whatever the SJW flame bait flavor of the week. This industry has been taken over by cucks and blue pill manginas, and they are wrecking things socially. It isn't about justice, its about power, and with power comes corruption. Its a sociopathic power structure. SJW harass people for no reason other then to feel power over others, because they have no power in their own life so they seek out to replace it by doing bullshit like this. I'm done with this bullshit. From now on, I'm only using javascript on my hobby code. I no longer will recommend it as a technology stack, it has been hijacked by sociopathic fools. I say, fuck it, boycott all of it. 
You're over-thinking it. You don't need those double quotes. elem.style.width = value + 'px'; Quotes are only needed in your first case because it was a string literal. 
&gt; Twitter isn't a single place, it's just a tool for managing a list of followers. It's also a way to have your every utterance indexed for the rest of time, to be queried, dug up, taken out of context, re-presented and used to have you randomly lynched and your life dismantled at any point in the future. And not even by someone you've necessarily pissed off - it can just be a single bored dipshit and their followers who want to make themselves feel important. I really can't fault anyone for bailing out of Twitter - frankly it's terrifying these days.
I've heard swearing described as the equivalent of auditory secondhand smoke, but this is the first time I've heard it described as auditory rape. Wow. 
It's called humor, kid. Chill.
&gt;a few poor wording choices Are they poor wording choices? According to whom?
&gt; Let's address the elephant in the room Now it all makes sense. That person wanted Nodevember to be a PHP conference. Of course you didn't want the author of a well-known JS book at that event. 
You have created a Morality out of maturity, but what is the value of maturity?
I guess a "promiscuity walk" would have too much negative connotation. 
I'm guessing it's more about power and fear. `Look what we can do if you don't toe the line.` 
Perfect thank you.
You're welcome a lot ! 
So a bit of backtracking there ... "don't have specific examples". The loud whispering rude behavior, did it or did it not include disparaging comments about boring presentations and ethnic accents?
&gt;and he prefers a single unwieldy thread on Mozilla Discourse). That's a bit foolish. &gt;uBO is leaps and bounds ahead of other ad-blocking extensions because of his innovations. I agree.
I'm offended by your inability to be offended.
My favorite version is using the phrase "being on the right side of history." Um, isn't it always premature to declare yourself on the right side of something that can only be determined with many years of hindsight? 
Ironically, this thread is a much better illustration of cry-bullying than dropping Crockford as a guest because they felt he had the wrong tone for their event.
Absolutely! Just to make sure, you are referring to a transgender attacking a "cis male" and not something I said in this post right? Cause FYI just in case anything came across that way because it wasn't my intent.
But you see, they had to drop the 'institutional' from institutional racism and sexism because otherwise it would highlight that their treatment of white straight cis men is exactly that.
I just hope the pendulum doesn't swing all the way to "We're dicks, bleaahhh!" sort of posturing. I just want to see people have a bit of tolerance balanced with professionalism all around, as if that's too much to ask.
It's a national pandemic that's getting fueled on both sides by the political scene (which should not be ignored this time, btw, but carefully watched, neutrally minded, until Nov 8th). I think there's something much deeper causing this behavior but I can't quite decide if it's a backlash at their prosperous parents or an institutional sinister doublethink indoctrination. Either way, it's deeply concerning for our future when 99.6% of the country is bullied by the 0.4% of otherkin. When it gets down to the level of COMPUTER PROGRAMMING, an area usually so far removed from this bullshit by its very nature, well... time to pay attention to **why**. I personally don't think it's because of oppression, but I'm open to debate. 
Hell, from what I gather, people can't even dredge up a solid accusation, much less evidence. It's just a vague heap of labels with no mention of measure, that we're all meant to tut-tut at and run away from, with the only flakes of concrete coming from a lot of confused barrel-scraping to try and suss out the few possible things that someone could be offended by.
There's no way to hide the requests that a browser makes. You can always open the developer tools and see all of them logged, or even use a tool like Wireshark to view the network activity. 
No. Never allow facists to control you.
Before you pull out the old "alt-right" label, [this survey](https://www.allthink.com/1588852) may be of interest to you, seeing as you associate KotakuInAction as right-wing. Seems to me "alt-right" has become the latest catch all term for anyone who disagrees with far-left orthodoxy, no matter their real political thoughts.
I'd always understood the inclusion of "warrior" to imply an over-the-top, thoughtless attitude more interested in the fighting than the things being fought for, that would sacrifice the cause to win the fight. Was there an earlier use of the term without that sarcastic/pejorative use?
&gt; Or, is this one of those "we're going to take the word back so we can feel more empowered" things? In one sense. In another (IMHO), it's using "slut shaming" as a single pejorative term, and "slut" is a part of the pejorative, not the subject. If you hyphenate "slut" into the act being described, the term could just as well mean "shaming [a promiscuous person] by calling them a slut", instead of "shaming [someone who is] a slut". It's similar to "witch-hunting" (in the metaphorical sense). Decrying "witch-hunting" is not decrying hunting people who are admittedly witches, it's decrying both the act of branding *and* hunting, as they are done in tandem. "Slut shaming" can refer to both the shaming and the branding, as they are tightly related. OTOH, "slut walk", I don't see how that can be anything other than counter-appropriation.
I guess you could inline/base64 them to hide the filename
so you're telling me I can eat the air in Austin? 
Is alt-right the new SJW boogieman?
The SJW playbook counts on their enemy rolling over and allowing noble defeat ("we won't stoop to their level."). The only way to get someone to abandon cheap, cowardly practices involving public shaming and attacking the personal and financial security of their opponents is to do the same to them so much more and with greater efficiency, that they will roll over and abandon such practices. Ghandi only won because he was fighting civilized opponents that didn't really want to fight. In a normal conflict of incompatible goals, only overwhelming force will get an opponent to yield. SJWs do not actually believe in letting people do what they wish. They want control over thought and speech in every venue they enter. Only by ridding organizations of these control-obsessed people, or relegating them to ridicule, can the principles of free expression be restored.
I don't know of a JS lib or framework, but if you're looking for a free program, [SketchUp](http://www.sketchup.com/) might be worth checking out
I will totally admit to not knowing the whole story, but if you reach a point where you ever think it's cool to call someone of color a 'half-savage', I personally think you may have lost the plot. Just one man's opinion, of course...
&gt; to what extent are we willing to go to make sure everyone is comfortable? The problem as I see it is that there seems to be far too much stock paid (among certain circles and mindsets) to the idea that any pain or discomfort whatsoever is inherently a bad thing, that all manner of mountains should moved whenever anyone expresses pain or discomfort, and any damage done or cost borne in doing so is acceptable, as it's done in the service of a noble cause. However, by the very nature of the fact that there are more than one person on this earth, one person's comfort is liable to infringe on another person's no matter what side of a decision is chosen. So choices must be made. The problem is that these choices are being guided by broad and inflexible principles that don't seek to solve problems through compromise or minimal disappointment. Instead, they favor decisive, total, and often visible action, led by categorization, prioritization, and simplistic rules, which is rarely the proper solution to anything but the most egregious behavior. Without nuance or flexibility, you're pretty much left with few options, all based on prioritization: Prioritize an "in crowd", prioritize the freedom of the offender, or prioritize the comfort of the offendee. The first of these is right out, the second risks devolution into the sort of anti-professional free-for-all that legitimately excludes anyone with sensibilities, and the third is what we have here, a situation where the first, loudest, or most saintly wheel to squeak gets mountains moved into whatever configuration they wish, while others who can manage to hold back their tears over trivialities continue to do so while having their experience chipped away. And decrying the third option may sound callous on its face-- surely those who can manage to hold back their tears can continue to do so, so that none need suffer! But tears are not necessarily indicative of pain, pain is not necessarily indicative of damage, and damage is not necessarily indicative of harm. When a person cries out at monsters, the first response should be to check for harmless shadows, not to immediately smash what turns out to be a coat rack. And if there is a seed of negativity there, the whole forest need not be levelled in response. They could have just as easily said, "We've had concerns with your topics of [...] and [...], and being as we wish to retain the utmost professionalism, we'd ask that you refrain from such topics or approaches in your talk.", tell the offendee it's been dealt with, and let them stay or go as they wish.
You forgot ageist. Senior developers are one of the _most_ excluded groups in technology.
How about kind of an MST3K thing? Sync up a stream of him commenting on the conference realtime.
It's a single annual event, he's a keynote, and he's a pretty big name. It'd leave a significant hole full of rumor if they just edited him out of the program. Hell, look at the amount of rumor flying around from their inadequate explanation.
Yeah, I wasn't implying anything about your statement or motives, just sort of musing in response that I hope it doesn't go too far over the other end, as such things have a tendency to do.
&gt; diversity and inclusivity are top priorities Rather ironic when ageism is rife in the industry and older developers are some of the most excluded. But sure @nexxylove, target the senior guys who's shoulders modern JS was built on, who such JS conferences wouldn't exist without, who's work YOUR job has been built on and make them feel excluded. But that's what modern intersectional feminism has turned into. Ageism, sexism, racism, intolerance &amp; divisiveness. This isn't about becoming better, bigger, warmer and more open hearted people. It's about nasty vindictiveness and spite, to find any possible excuse for offence. What's more scary is that these people are now ending up in "developer relations" roles, that should be about drawing people in. Not burning the house down.
Was curious who, and thus maybe gain some insight as why someone would initiate this vendetta against Crockford, so google being my friend ... hmmm Besides accusing Crockford of being non-inclusive, in the past they've gone directly to a person's employer, for what one can assume, with the intent for getting them fired. Going as far to skewing the evidence to place things in the most negative light. The offense? Well read it here. You decide if the proposed punishment (likely unemployment) fit the heinous crime. https://archive.is/mD7XP Despite the dubious source there is some credence here as this was from another reddit thread where the person in question did not deny that it happened and offered a contrite word or two on the situation. Also they did more than call for a boycott because of the all white male lineup, there was a serious accusation made towards Crockford. https://twitter.com/nexxylove/status/771503406716334080 Specifically, "he (Crockford) has repeatedly shown himself to be actively hostile to fostering inclusivity and many will decline to speak if he is invited." Worth noting that Nodevember had immediately offered to add two diverse keynotes ... evidently not good enough as the person in question sought Crockford's removal for being "actively hostile to fostering inclusivity." Strong accusations if true. 
IIRC there are some performance issues in Android still and there's a lot of more advanced stuff you will have to either write an Objective-C bridge for or can't do. And of course, it's still a fairly new technology and may change often (but so does Swift!). This blog post may help: https://discord.engineering/using-react-native-one-year-later-91fd5e949933
DONE!
The smiley face at the end of your sentence just indicates how butthurt you are. You're not fooling anyone with this shit.
It's a hit and miss really. There were couple of good talks last year but other than that it's nothing really spectacular. It's sort of glorified meetup tbh. I should have gone to Node Interactive instead which had much better talks. 
In addition to Hammer, there's swipe.js if you just want a swipeable slideshow
This is what these people are missing. Their livelihoods depend on stuff he came up with. But he used a couple of offensive words and now he is the devil and his contributions are irrelevant (but hey, we'll still use them!!). And it wasn't even that bad. Remember around 10 years ago when Michael Richards lost his shit against some hecklers? That shit was rough, and he had to apologize and even nowadays he still says that was one of his biggest mistakes in his career. The shit that Crockford said is kindergarden level. Only someone who is hypersensitive would complain about it. 
Hmm I use JSZip for exporting debug logs for our WebApp that can get quite large, I don't think I ever noticed a 5MB limit... I guess I'll be checking this Monday.
JS puts food on my table but I have to agree with NPM and the JS environment in general being a bit of a clusterfuck at the moment. 
You've met some ridiculous people then.
Jszip doesn't have a limit (to my little knowledge), it's based on server side limits. However, the creator acknowledges it's a 5MB limit that can be put to 15. How are you doing your debug logs?
We're still castrating gay men; we're just convincing them that they have a woman's soul first, and letting them think that it is a medical necessity.
So @nexxylove got Crockford kicked out to create a "safe and inclusive" environment -- just shortly after doing a little public American flag-burning. https://twitter.com/clintonlingus/status/747013683746856960 Free speech offends -- and there's a value in that tension. She's willing to create her own spaces of marginalization... but unwilling to tolerate them for others? 
&gt; [other speakers] were going to back out From a conference perspective that is a very real and rational reason to change the lineup. &gt; did not feel comfortable attending/speaking with him there Those are personal decisions to anyone involved. You can ask for reasons from them directly, but they have the right to refuse to answer.
Publication is not always an invitation for response; in this case the post seems to serve as both a warning and a notification. Long conversation without communication is draining, and there is no shame in stepping away from the conversation at that point. Saves both sides time from talking at walls.
what pastebin? edit: nevermind, i see this isn't the root comment, and it's linked in an adjacent thread.
Ninja edit: Ah that statement.
