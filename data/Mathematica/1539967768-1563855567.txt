I've updated the main post so I'm more clear.
Without knowing more about the phi functions it's not clear why you would expect this to converge. It seems like a more complicated version of an integral of 1/(x-y), which would not converge over a rectangular domain in which x could equal y.
The phi in this case would be a hydrogen wavefunction, which should be continuous in the domains interested. That's why I suspect that the problem should come from the denominator. Sorry I didn't make that clear in the question.
You have a precision problem. `pmfFunc[100, 70, x]` returns `29372339821610944823963760 (1 - x)^30 x^70`, composed of very large integers, which you compare to the real-valued number `0.04`; visibly this leads to rounding errors. It works if you remain exact until the very end, by replacing `0.04` with `4/100` and `Solve` with `NSolve`: NSolve[pmfFunc[100, 70, x] == 4/100 &amp;&amp; 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1, x, Reals] {{x -&gt; 0.64111}, {x -&gt; 0.754779}} An alternative, if you need to remain real-valued, would be to replace your binomial distribution with the [corresponding normal law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution#Normal_approximation) in the regions where you can make this approximation.
Have you looked at [CellularAutomaton](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CellularAutomaton.html)?
Yes I have.
It is difficult to help you without more information :) The help page of this function has examples of 2D cellular automata. If you want us to help you debug your code, we need to see it.
I'm actually trying to solve a problem involving partial derivatives of arbitrary "constants" so that D[s[c^2*x^2],c] == 2c s[x^2] Also, I'm getting D[s[x^2*y^2], {{x, y}, 2}] == s[{{2 y^2, 4 x y}, {4 x y, 2 x^2}}] But I want the output to be {{s[2 y^2], s[4 x y]}, {s[4 x y], s[2 x^2]}} instead. What other definitions are needed?
I still fail to understand what you are trying to achieve (just out of curiosity, could you link to the problem?), but to technically solve this last point: SetAttributes[s, Listable]
Code???
Right, sorry. Plot1 = Plot[2.6300751871128003`*^-10 + 8.180451128176683`*^-10 x, {x, 0, 3.5}] Plot2 = Plot[9.411428571428569`*^-8 + 1.3132142857142852`*^-7 x, {x, 0, 3.5}] Show[plot1, plot2] Looking at the plot, they seem to intersect around x=0.7. Solving algebraically, however, the intersect somewhere around x=-.32 
On mobile at the moment so I can't actually check this, but multiply everything by 10^10 and check it again, Mathematica gets kinda fucky with anything below machine precision (10^-10). Also try coating everything in evaluate, N, and chop (if you don't care about precision)
 Solve[2.6300751871128003`*^-10 + 8.180451128176683`*^-10 x == -9.411428571428569`*^-8 + 1.3132142857142852`*^-7 x, x] Yields `{{x -&gt; 0.723179}}`
Thanks a bunch! 
It does seem to follow the rule. You are not making it easy to help you, I can't guess what rule you wanted to program nor what results you expected. I will detail what your code does, perhaps this will help you find your mistake: * You specified the #14 5-neighbor 2-color totalistic rule, working as per the following: * For each cell, let `s` be the sum of its four direct neighbors and of itself. If `s` is equal to 2, 3, or 4, then the cell at the next step will be on, otherwise it will be off. * It is supposed to be a 2D automaton but you are applying it on a 1D grid of 1 row and 10 columns, with periodic boundary conditions (meaning that the cell on the right of the rightmost cell is the leftmost cell, and the cell on the top/bottom of any cell is itself). Because of this, you actually implemented the 1D rule #54. * `CellularAutomaton` called the way you did returns a list of all steps up to step `a`. Meaning that for `a=2` it returns `{step0, step1, step2}` and for `a=3` `{step0, step1, step2, step3}`, etc. This explains perhaps why "the tree is just growing downwards for each step" as you say. If you want to just see the step number `a`, you need to call it with two brackets around the time argument: `CellularAutomaton[rule, start, {{a}}]`.
Mathematica is a complete IDE. R and python are useful on data analysis, but not good at math.
&gt; Where do you see Mathematica in a couple of years as opposed to open source tools like R and Python? Both seem to be growing exponentially with new libraries and user growth. both R and Python also have web hosting capabilities, R Shiny and Dash respectively. A lot of universities are also migrating towards open source, I would like to know if it is worth getting licenses for an enterprise. Commonality: 1. Mathematica, R and Python are all inherently slow languages. 2. Mathematica, R and Python all rely upon extensive libraries written in much higher performance languages. 3. Mathematica, R and Python all have lots of documentation for their extensive libraries (although I feel Mathematica's documentation is significantly better). Differences: 1. Mathematica is a commercial product with an emphasis on aesthetics whereas R and Python are poorly designed programming languages (not as bad as C++ and PHP but bad in the grand scheme of things) with zero emphasis on anything that isn't fun for the developers of those languages. 2. Mathematica is a graphical programming language with support for things like image literals in code that are displayed graphically. Python and R are text-based languages. Jupyter puts text-based languages in the browser with a notebook-like interface 3. Mathematica is a term-rewrite language so it is naturally good at symbolic manpulations out-of-the-box whereas both R and Python suck at this. 4. Mathematica is better at many paradigms like functional programming. R and Python struggle with functional programming. 5. Python has better libraries for non-math stuff like building websites. 6. Mathematica's target audience is non-programmers whereas Python's target audience is software developers. 7. Python has at least an order of magnitude more users than Mathematica. 8. Mathematica has derivatives like Wolfram Alpha. Python not so much. However, big picture I think it is far more likely that they'll all be displaced by something like Julia. 
Have you tried sympy in python?
Yeah I tried that, but it just didn't have all the features I needed. I can't remember which ones they were but I tried porting all my Mathematica code over to sympy to showcase my 'programming' talent when I was first looking for industry jobs.
What makes you say python is a poorly designed language?
See, for example, [Guido on tail call optimisation (TCO)](http://flyingfrogblog.blogspot.com/2009/04/when-celebrity-programmers-attack-guido.html). Every now and again, Guido pops up and says something moronic about programming language theory (PLT). From a PLT perspective, Python is BASIC++. That's adequate for lots of people but it makes for a poorly designed language. 
&gt; he thinks iteration is better than recursion An ideological position born of ignorance. &gt; It's not inherently wrong The belief that recurrence relations are evil isn't inherently wrong either. Also, he dismissed the people who pointed out all of his errors as "academics" which is just name-calling. He was literally shaming people for having an education. The guy is a complete idiot. &gt; helps with error messages Nonsense! &gt; I don't think these things constitute a poorly designed language. Dare I ask what you think does constitute a poorly designed language? 
&gt;An ideological position born of ignorance. Not necessarily. Iteration and recursion are very similar, TCO even optimizes some recursion to iteration. His goal is to be consistent, so he picked one of them, which happened to be the less functional (as in the paradigm) one. &gt;Nonsense! Why would that be? He cited that as one of his reasons. &gt;Dare I ask what you think does constitute a poorly designed language? A language who's purpose is to be able to do x which severely limits your ability to do x. Mathematica's purpose is to be more of an end product than most programming languages with an emphasis on symbolic manipulation. Python's purpose is to be a production language with an emphasis on consistency and readability among other things. I think both of these languages succeed in their respective goals.
What a weirdly biased analysis! Yeah, Python has "at least" an order of magnitude more users, sort of like the Sun is "at least" an order of magnitude larger than the Earth. Python is easier to read and understand, easier to develop large projects with, and has a much wider array of use-cases. Sure, it might lack some theoretical beauty, but hey, few people are pushing out big projects in List, Haskell, or whatever theoretically pretty language you favor. Mathematica is a cool platform, and depending on what you are trying to do, it can be extremely useful! However, it is not a general purpose tool the way Python is. Staring at blocks of Mathematica code has it's own unique way of giving me a headache.
&gt; few people are pushing out big projects in Lisp, Haskell, or whatever theoretically pretty language you favor Few people are doing nuclear physics vs sudoku. &gt; not a general purpose tool the way Python is In what sense? &gt; There is a reason Python has such a huge userbase Lots of reasons, e.g. being free. &gt; it is really rapidly encroaching into scientific circles Scientific use is certainly a miniscule fraction of the whole. Python is common because it is a glue language. 
Incorrect comparison: - Mathematica is symbolic maths language based on term rewrite. - Python is a general programming language, generally not very good at symbolic maths (SymPy is extremely castrated, documentation is nearly non-existent) - R is for stats More correct comparison: - Maple, another commercial package. Comparable to Mathematica. Has its own strengths (e.g. better code conversion to Fortran/MATLAB/C), but overall I prefer Mathematica. - Maxima. This one is open-source. The problem with Maxima is that it is old, there is a lot of legacy code and overall mess (e.g. arrays). There are a few problems with some corner cases where it produces wrong results (e.g. limits of complex logarithm). On the other hand, it is much more hackable. There are really interesting things you can do once you hack into Lisp back-end. For example, I made a simple spreadsheet "app" for Maxima.

I think you must have written `f[x]=36` (with `=` instead of `==`) at some point, which overruled the definition of the function and made `f[x]` always return 36. Then the equation you are trying to solve boils down to `36==36` which is always true, which Mathematica expresses by returning `{{}}`. To clear all the rules associated with `f` you can use the command `ClearAll[f]`.
&gt; I've found that symbolic python sympy can do about 80% of the things Mathematica can do that I want to do But how easy is it? e.g. how much Python code is required to integrate `√tan(x)`? 
&gt; If we consider purely symbolic maths stuff For that, yes. For other things, not so much.
Sometimes 8x less code is good though. :-) 
What is \`f\` ?
I think I could reduce mathematica's resolution in the Option Inspector, but the "apply" button is greyed out...
It's like comparing fight jets with passenger carriers: they are built for different purposes. There is an overlap (they both can fly), but it is not sufficient for a proper comparison.
&gt; Python and R are plenty good at math, but only the numerical kind. Tell it to someone who does a serious numerical work... If you want something quick and dirty, use MATLAB (proper support for sparse matrices, preconditioners, etc.) If you need performance: Fortran or C/C++.
f is the name of the function, I think it is an arbitrary name chosen by the user In this case, f\[x\_\] had (or should have been) been defined as a quadratic function of x.
Many things happen in \`Solve\` depending on \`f\`
2 days ago I opened for my self Mathematica . I don't know. I think Mathcad is more useful...for solving tasks... What do you think? 
Just like all of the other subs you post in for homework help, this is not the place for the question.
What is the question ? 
Just a little bit of more info. I realize the 5th order polynomial is probably overfitting, but I am still playing around with things. My main trouble comes when I try to subtract the fit from the data. I know I need to convert the continuous polynomial into a list of (x,y) using the values of x in the raw data, then subtract the different y's from the raw data (basically residuals). I am just hitting a bit of a wall, and I'm very new to mathematica. Thanks!
If your data is structured following a 2D list: `data = {{x1, y1}, {x2, y2}, {x3, y3}, etc.}`, then you can extract the `xs` with either `data[[All, 1]]` or `First/@data` (the operator `/@` maps the function on the left to each element of the list on the right). You can also extract the `ys` in the same way: `data[[All, 2]]` or `Last/@data`. Then, you want to apply `bgfit` to the `xs`: `bgfit/@xs`, and subtract that from the original `ys`: `ys - bgfit/@xs`. Finally, you probably want to plot the difference as a function of the `xs`, for this, you need to reassemble a 2D list in the same shape as the original data; you can do it like this: `Transpose[{xs, ys - bgfit/@xs}]`. There are many other ways, for example: `{#1, #2-bgfit[#1]}&amp; @@@ data` which gives you the same result.
I’m going to guess the x axis is nanometers and this is a fluorescence spectrum of some kind? Do you have a blank?
Thanks! This is exactly what I was trying to do. Turns out my polynomial approach was wrong though, as it distorts the data far too much. Argon has offered up a good alternative
You're exactly right about this being a fluorescence spectrum. Your approach is much more effective than mine, as the polynomials distorted the data. Thanks!
You can directly access the residuals from the linear model fit with bgfit["FitResiduals"] and they be plotted with ListPlot[bgfit["FitResiduals"]]
What code have you tried?
What would `x * lambda &lt; rs` even mean? x is a variable ranging from -inf to +inf...
Yeah well I mean experimentally you probably want to collect a before and after, or signal and blank. Otherwise it might just be instrumental artefacts you’re collecting. 
Sorry that should read r \* \\\[Lambda\] &lt; rs. 
How much memory does your machine have? Is it 32-bit or 64-bit? On a reasonable Linux machine I've never seen that behavior before.
I’ve never installed Mathematica on Linux, but it sounds like you have an installer shell script, and that you’re trying to load that into a text editor. It will be big and so the text editor is struggling to read it (that’s why you have a progress bar). You don’t want that, so close the text editor and open a Terminal instead. In the Terminal you should type: cd Downloads sh Mathematica_11.03_LINUX.sh That should start the installer. It might bring up a GUI or it might be all text based. Happy Cake Day!
Interesting. Assuming a spherical cow, it has a radius of 0.544086.
This is a great tutorial...thanks for pulling together and sharing.
Given "a ↑^(b) c", how would I use that?
`ctrl+^` to make an exponent.
Yeah, exponents are easy. I want to be able to use all hyperoperations though.
Do you just want to "enter the notation", as you originally said, or do you want it to also execute the function as well?
I want to execute the function. plugging in (2,2,3) should give me 16
Yeah, that is one of the suggestions I tried, but it wouldn't work for me. MakeBoxes[UpArrow[n_][a_, b_], StandardForm] := RowBox@{ MakeBoxes[a], SuperscriptBox["\[UpArrow]", MakeBoxes[n]], MakeBoxes[b] }; 2~UpArrow[2]~3 just returns "2 ↑^(2) 3", not an evaluation of that.
Sorry, I skimmed that link and didn't realize it was just notation. Again, you have to implement the function yourself.
Well they say it should give an evaluation. It isn't working for me though.
That's because you're only using the formatting part. You have to copy the whole example, not just the last bit.
Oh, I thought they meant that they formatted to code to be nicer.
This is so stupid 
now let's try recreating this proof using mathematica
Your question is not very clear...what do you want? 
I second that your question is not very clear. Do you want to return a list of "failed attempts" at beating 50, with the final one being the first to beat 50? If so, you could try: L = {0}; While[Last[L] &lt; 50, rp = RandomReal[{1, 10}, 2]; L = Append[L, rp[[1]] rp[[2]]]]; Print[Rest[L]]
 This paper proves Einstein is wrong: when he states https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#Criticisms "Albert Einstein wrote, "One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable,..."[59]
Oh dear. Let's pack it up, people.
The problem is with Sum[FactorialPower[2-k,2]/k!,{k,0,Infinity}], obviously, since the true value of the sum is in fact E. The closed form given by Sum[FactorialPower[2-k,2]/k!,{k,0,n}] is not correct. Probably good to file a bug report with Wolfram.
I'll assume you did not mean to post this in a subreddit dedicated to a Mathematics software... What, exactly, do you not understand? How many buttons are 3/4 inch long?
I think you meant to post in another sub. Nevertheless, all you need to do is multiply the length of each button by the number of buttons in each column then sum up your results.
What would be the total length? Just answer
Just giving you the answer would be the opposite of helpful. If you don't care about understanding what you're doing then talk to your teacher, don't try to cheat. 
Fuck off, cheater.
I'm lazy, so I simply used Wolfram Alpha's feedback form. I got a confirmation per email: &gt;We appreciate your feedback regarding Wolfram|Alpha. The issue you reported has been passed along to our development team for review. Thank you for helping us improve Wolfram|Alpha. &gt; &gt;Input: Implies\[FactorialPower\[2 - k, 2\] == (2 - k)\*(1 - k), Sum\[FactorialPower\[2 - k, 2\]\*(1/k!), {k, 0, Infinity}\] == Sum\[(2 - k)\*(1 - k)\*(1/k!), {k, 0, Infinity}\]\] &gt; &gt;Message: Wolfram Alpha gives the wrong answer (False). The correct answer is True.
It sounds like math may not be for you. Calculus is relatively straightforward, by comparison to other topics. If you failed it twice, you may want to reconsider your career path.
true, ive been thinking about that but I only have certain time that financial aid can cover me .
I think somewhere you have something similar coded up: Plot[ Integrate[Fxn[t], {t,0,10}], {t,0,10}] What would be happening is that the Plot function is internally defining t to some value to calculate a y-value. So in the first calculation, the Plot function tries to calculate: Integrate[Fxn[0.000001], {0.00001,0,10}] Which gives and invalid bounds error.
This is the subreddit for the software Mathematica. You might want to try r/math.
Are you taking advantage of office hours? They're a hugely helpful resource (and often underutilized) resource. Math might not be for you, but it's also possible that you just need a little help finding a way to think about the material that makes sense to you. People have different learning styles, and the way one textbook presents a concept may not be the best way to understand it—sitting down with someone experienced and working together to translate the material into a language you understand can make a massive difference! As an added bonus, by spending a decent amount time working one-on-one with a professor, they'll be much better able to give you advice on whether a math career is the way to go :)
Thank you very much, I have to learn a lot about mathematica ;) This is the working code :) &gt;squareWave\[t\_, period\_, duty\_\] := UnitBox\[Mod\[t/period, 1.\]/(2. duty)\] &gt; &gt;mysquare\[c\_\] = 20\*squareWave\[c, 10\^-3, 0.6\] - 10 &gt; &gt;Vo\[z\_, R\_, CC\_\] = -(1/(R\*CC) \* Integrate\[mysquare\[x\], {x, 0, z} \]) &gt; &gt;Plot\[Vo\[s, 10\^4, 10\^-9\], {s, 0, 0.1}\] &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
What is totalMountRegion? With clarRegion instead I run out of memory (&gt;6GB). Does the following do what you want? NIntegrate[clarFunc[x, y, z], {x, 0, 5}, {y, 0, 5}, {z, 7, m}
Any constant with a decimal point will have about 16 digits of accuracy. Any such constant combined with anything else will then have 16 digits of accuracy or less. To have a goal of 100 digits of accuracy you should change all your decimal values to exact fractions and see how close it can get to 100.
The Mathematica syntax is that for functions you should use the square \[\] brackets. So your definition should read: r1\[s\_\] := D1+D2+Sqrt\[s\^2+s/D2\] This is not python! :)
&gt;This returns: (exp (-D1 + D2/vc))\[1\] This shouldn't happen unless you have defined term1 like so: term1[x_] := Exp[-(D1-D2/vc)*x][1] Check with "?term1" and try "Clear\[term1\]" if you want to clear the definitions. &gt;Like, if I wanted to define: &gt; &gt;F\[x\_,s\_\] := term1\[x,s\]+term2\[x,s\]+term3\[x\]... This should work fine just line in any other language.
As a side note, it's a semi-common convention to not name your own functions/variables starting with capital letters to avoid clashing with built-ins. All built-in functions start with capital letters, so if you start your names with lowercase letters you won't clash. 
Here is my attempt at modifying the given code to meet your needs: Protect[qCO, qDO]; qOperatorQ[expr_] := MatchQ[expr, qCO[_Integer] | qDO[_Integer] | Ket[__Integer]]; (*take scalars out*) CenterDot[left___, Times[scalar_?NumericQ, op_?qOperatorQ], right___] := Times[ scalar, CenterDot[left, op, right] ]; (*Implement commutation relations*) CenterDot[left___, qDO[k_Integer], qCO[j_Integer], right___] := Plus[ CenterDot[left, qCO[j], qDO[k], right], KroneckerDelta[k, j] CenterDot[left, right] ]; (*Allow to use powers of operators*) CenterDot[left___, Power[op : (qCO[_Integer] | qDO[_Integer]), p_Integer], right___] := CenterDot[ left, Sequence @@ ConstantArray[op, p], right ]; (*effective OneIdentity attribute*) CenterDot[op_?qOperatorQ] := op; (*implement action on Fock states*) CenterDot[left___, qDO[k_Integer], Ket[0 ..]] := 0; CenterDot[left___, qCO[k_Integer], Ket[n__Integer]] := Module[ {l = Max[Length[{n}], k], nn}, nn = PadRight[{n}, l]; Times[ Sqrt[nn[[k]] + 1], CenterDot[left, Ket @@ (nn + UnitVector[l, k])] ] ]; CenterDot[left___, qDO[k_], Ket[n__Integer]] := Module[ {l = Max[Length[{n}], k], nn}, nn = PadRight[{n}, l]; Times[ Sqrt[nn[[k]]], CenterDot[left, Ket @@ (nn - UnitVector[l, k])] ] ]; The following should produce the same output as the original. Try to create and annihilate particles in states k&gt;1 by using a\[k\] instead of a\[1\]. I didn't run many tests, so please check if it behaves as you expect. a = qDO; SuperDagger[a[k_]] = qCO[k]; a[1]\[CenterDot]Ket[2] a[1]\[CenterDot]a[1]\[CenterDot]Ket[2] a[1]^2\[CenterDot]Ket[2] a[1]\[CenterDot]a[1]\[CenterDot]a[1]\[CenterDot]Ket[2] a[1]\[CenterDot]SuperDagger[a[1]]\[CenterDot]a[1]\[CenterDot]Ket[2] a[1]\[CenterDot](SuperDagger[a[1]])^4\[CenterDot]a[1]\[CenterDot]Ket[2]
Thanks! This helps me out a little more! (See here: [https://imgur.com/Ey3P3Gc](https://imgur.com/Ey3P3Gc)). To further test this code I tried the calculation for the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong–Ou–Mandel\_effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong–Ou–Mandel_effect)). When I exchange my a's and b's with the respective Operators c and d I get the following result: [https://imgur.com/i9kL3h4](https://imgur.com/i9kL3h4) And not as expected the Ket\[2,0\]+Ket\[0,2\] result. It seems that Mathematica is unable to simplify the calculation with the new operators. It would be really neat if you have some idea on how to tackle this problem. Thanks again in advance and sorry for asking such noob questions! &amp;#x200B; Best regards, SnicSnac 
This looks really nice! Thank you very much! I still have one question though: If I try to compute the following expression `1/2 ((a[1] + I*a[2])\[CenterDot](a[1] - I*a[2]) + (a[1] + I*a[2])\[CenterDot](a[1] - I*a[2]))\[CenterDot]Ket[0, 0] //Simplify` I get this as a result: `1/2 (2 (qCO[1]\[CenterDot]qCO[1] - I qCO[1]\[CenterDot]qCO[2] + I qCO[2]\[CenterDot]qCO[1] + qCO[2]\[CenterDot]qCO[2]))\[CenterDot]Ket[0, 0]` However, if I expand this by hand: `0.5 (a[1] + I*a[2])\[CenterDot](a[1] - I*a[2])\[CenterDot]Ket[0, 0] + 0.5 (a[1] + I*a[2])\[CenterDot](a[1] - I*a[2])\CenterDot]Ket[0, 0] // Simplify` I get the desired result: `1.41421 Ket[0, 2] + 1.41421 Ket[2, 0]` Is there some workaround for that? Do I have to define the expansion of the terms myself? How would this look like? I am still puzzled about the syntax. Seems pretty unfamiliar for me (My background: I am more familiar with Matlab/Python but I want to learn Mathematica and thought that this would be a neat problem to do so). &amp;#x200B; Again thanks in advance and best regards, SnicSnac
What do you not understand? The instructions? Or how to express them in code? For the first question, let's imagine the argument is named `x`. How would you check if `x` is between -1 and 1?
Also what I do not understand is this behavior: In[38]:= 0.5 (a[1] + I*a[2]^2)\[CenterDot](a[1] - I*a[2])\[CenterDot]Ket[0, 0] + 0.5 (a[1] + I*a[2])\[CenterDot](a[1] - I*a[2])\[CenterDot]Ket[0, 0] // Simplify Out[38]:= (0. - 0.5 I) (qCO[1] + I qCO[2]^2)\[CenterDot]Ket[ 0, 1] + (0.5 + 0. I) (qCO[1] + I qCO[2]^2)\[CenterDot]Ket[ 1, 0] + (0.707107 + 0. I) Ket[0, 2] + (0.707107 + 0. I) Ket[2, 0] I just added the square in the first bracket of the input. &amp;#x200B; Or the following behavior where I try to take the square of the whole first bracket: In[39]:= 0.5 (a[1] + I*a[2])^2\[CenterDot](a[1] - I*a[2])\[CenterDot]Ket[0, 0] + 0.5 (a[1] + I*a[2])\[CenterDot](a[1] - I*a[2])\[CenterDot]Ket[0, 0] // Simplify Out[39]:= (0. - 0.5 I) (qCO[1] + I qCO[2])^2\[CenterDot]Ket[ 0, 1] + (0.5 + 0. I) (qCO[1] + I qCO[2])^2\[CenterDot]Ket[ 1, 0] + (0.707107 + 0. I) Ket[0, 2] + (0.707107 + 0. I) Ket[2, 0] However, If I do not square the bracket but instead just use it twice, I get the desired output: In[40]:= 0.5 (a[1] + I*a[2])\[CenterDot](a[1] + I*a[2])\[CenterDot](a[1] - I*a[2])\[CenterDot]Ket[0, 0] + 0.5 (a[1] + I*a[2])\[CenterDot](a[1] - I*a[2])\[CenterDot]Ket[0, 0] // Simplify Out[40]:= 0.707107 Ket[0, 2] + (0. + 1.22474 I) Ket[0, 3] + (0.707107 + 0.

How?
its not perfect but i used MemberQ func. , f\[x\_\] := -1 &lt; x &lt; 1 , MemberQ\[f\[0.5\]\] and i got True.
What was your intention with `MemberQ`? Your definition of `f` already correctly answers the first question: it is a predicate (meaning, a function that returns `True` or `False`) that returns `True` if its argument is between -1 and 1. If you are new to the language (and also to programming in general), you might benefit from reading through [this tutorial](http://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction/2nd-ed/) before trying to do these exercises.
Usually when Mathematica returns the input integral, it means that it doesn't know how to do it. Try adding some assumptions to help it out. Unless necessary, try replacing Subscript[v,g] with just v, and Subscript[k,c] with just c (or any other symbol not used already). If you know Beta and Sigma will be positive or real or what have you, specify that.
The missing Superdagger and the floating point numbers make it harder to verify your tests. The product of operators needs to be defined. We also have to extend the test function again to account for sums and products of operators (I have also changed the test for scalar multiples to use recursion): qOperatorQ[expr_] := MatchQ[expr, qCO[_Integer] | qDO[_Integer] | Ket[__Integer] | Times[scalar_?NumericQ, _?qOperatorQ] | Plus[op_?qOperatorQ, _?qOperatorQ] | CenterDot[op_?qOperatorQ, _?qOperatorQ]]; There is a peculiarity in the pattern matching that I don't understand. I have to use named pattern for the first argument ("op" in the above code). The names are not used, but without them the matching doesn't work. (*implement product of operators*) CenterDot[left___, CenterDot[op1_?qOperatorQ, op2_?qOperatorQ],right___] := CenterDot[left, op1, op2, right];
&gt;Is there something which I am missing in the definitions of the operators? If yes how can this be implemented? You are missing that Mathematica doesn't know yet that powers of operators are also operators. So once again we have to extend the test function that checks whether an expression is an operator (or ket): qOperatorQ[expr_] := MatchQ[expr, qCO[_Integer] | qDO[_Integer] | Ket[__Integer] | Times[scalar_?NumericQ, _?qOperatorQ] | Plus[op_?qOperatorQ, _?qOperatorQ] | CenterDot[op_?qOperatorQ, _?qOperatorQ] | Power[qCO[_Integer] | qDO[_Integer], _Integer]]; This seems to work for your examples. I'm not sure if there are cases where a pattern like Power[op_?qOperatorQ, _Integer] might be necessary (which would also match nonsense like powers of kets). We must also allow powers of operators (and kets as a side effect) that are not simply qDO\[k\_\] or qCO\[k\_\]. We do this by modifying the definition under "(\*Allow to use powers of operators\*)": (*Allow to use powers of operators*) CenterDot[left___, Power[op_?qOperatorQ, p_Integer], right___] := CenterDot[ left, Sequence @@ ConstantArray[op, p], right ]; Test: In[20]:= 1/2 (SuperDagger[a[1]] + I SuperDagger[a[2]]^2)\[CenterDot](SuperDagger[a[1]] - I SuperDagger[a[2]])\[CenterDot]Ket[0, 0] + 1/2 (SuperDagger[a[1]] + I SuperDagger[a[2]])\[CenterDot](SuperDagger[a[1]] - I SuperDagger[a[2]])\[CenterDot]Ket[0, 0] // Simplify // InputForm Out[20]//InputForm= (Sqrt[2]*Ket[0, 2] + Sqrt[6]*Ket[0, 3] - I*Ket[1, 1] + I*Sqrt[2]*Ket[1, 2] + 2*Sqrt[2]*Ket[2, 0])/2 In[21]:= 1/2 (SuperDagger[a[1]] + I SuperDagger[a[2]])^2\[CenterDot](SuperDagger[a[1]] - I SuperDagger[a[2]])\[CenterDot]Ket[0, 0] + 1/2 (SuperDagger[a[1]] + I SuperDagger[a[2]])\[CenterDot](SuperDagger[a[1]] - I SuperDagger[a[2]])\[CenterDot]Ket[0, 0] // Simplify // InputForm Out[21]//InputForm= (Ket[0, 2] + I*Sqrt[3]*Ket[0, 3] + Ket[1, 2] + Ket[2, 0] + I*Ket[2, 1] + Sqrt[3]*Ket[3, 0])/Sqrt[2] Keep testing and feel free to ask if you come across other problems. &amp;#x200B; &gt;The definitions still seem unintuitive to me. For example this one: &gt; &gt;(\*implement sum of operators\*) &gt; &gt;CenterDot\[left\_\_\_, Plus\[op1\_?qOperatorQ, op2\_?qOperatorQ\], right\_\_\_\] := &gt; &gt; Plus\[CenterDot\[left, op1, right\], CenterDot\[left, op2, right\]\] &gt; &gt;Or this one: &gt; &gt;(\*Allow to use powers of operators\*) &gt; &gt;CenterDot\[left\_\_\_, Power\[op : (qCO\[\_Integer\] | qDO\[\_Integer\]), p\_Integer\], right\_\_\_\] := &gt; &gt;CenterDot\[left,Sequence @@ ConstantArray\[op, p\], right\]; This uses pattern matching. The expression on the left hand side of ":=" contains patterns and is replaced by the right hand side if it is matched anywhere. It is helpful to keep in mind that all expressions come with a head, the part before "\[". For most expressions you can get the full structure by using //FullForm on the expression, among the exceptions are integers and reals that have heads Integer and Real. The underscore "\_" matches any expression, "\_Integer" matches expressions with head "Integer" (normal integer numbers), "p\_Integer" is the same pattern, but for later use the matched part is named "p". Two underscores "\_\_" match a sequence of expressions (one or more), i.e. a coma separated sequence of arguments inside "\[\]". Three underscores match a sequence of zero or more. Use "\_?" to apply a test function to the expression. If the function after "?" evaluates to "True", then the pattern is matched. The above code also has ":", used to assign the name on the left to the pattern on the right, and "|", which is "or" for patterns. "MatchQ" is a useful function for test purposes: In[22]:= qDO[1] + qDO[2] // FullForm Out[22]//FullForm= Plus[qDO[1], qDO[2]] In[23]:= MatchQ[qDO[1] + qDO[2], Plus[_?qOperatorQ, _?qOperatorQ]] Out[23]= False In[24]:= MatchQ[qDO[1] + qDO[2], Plus[op_?qOperatorQ, _?qOperatorQ]] Out[24]= True &gt;If you know any good source I would be grateful. The best source for me is the documentation that comes with Mathematica (and of course Google). The documentation comes with many examples and tutorials, the search field also works for symbols. Use "?" and "??" from the input for quick help about an expression: In[25]:= ?Apply Apply[f, expr] or f @@ expr replaces the head of expr by f. Apply[f, expr, {1}] or f@@@expr replaces heads at level 1 of expr by f. Apply[f, expr, levelspec] replaces heads in parts of expr specified by levelspec. Apply[f] represents an operator form of Apply that can be applied to an expression. In[26]:= ?Sequence Sequence[expr , expr , …] represents a sequence of arguments to be spliced automatically into any function. The notebook interface should also provide links to the detailed documentation. So "@@" in the code above takes the list created by "ConstantArray" (which has head "List") and turns the listed elements into arguments of "CenterDot". 
. A = -i*t*vg; B = -(1/2*β + σ^2/2); f = Exp[A*k]*Exp[B*(k - kc)^2]; Integrate[f, k] returns (E^(-(1/2) i t vg (2 kc-(i t vg)/(β+σ^2))) Sqrt[Pi/2]* Erf[(i t vg+(k-kc) (β+σ^2))/(Sqrt[2] Sqrt[β+σ^2])])/Sqrt[β+σ^2]
What happens if you just do `p1=` rather than `p1:=`?
It just duplicates the half circle so it shows both halves twice each. https://imgur.com/a/oC9azCo
So obviously I don't want to just give you the answer because programming (even though Mathematica is babytown programming---and I say this as someone who cannot use any other language except a bit of python) is all about doing. However, Mathematica is very user friendly! Solving differential equations there is the function DSolve that will allow for analytical solutions if it can give it. If not, there is NDSolve wherein you specify the correct parameter range you wish to solve. Mathematica can also take intuitive input. For example, the d.e. x''[t]+x[t]==0 is perfectly accepted by mathematica! I meant to write more than this but I actually have to go, good luck! Functions can be given arguments like F[beta_]=1+beta etc.
Can you paste the code?
Dang, I didn't realize this. How did you figure that out if you don't mind me asking. Also thank you so much for the help!
1.) fS[p_]:=-800+50*p; fD[p_]:=1900-40*p; 2.) Plot[{fS[p],fD[p]}, {v,0,60}] 3.) equPrice = x/.Solve[fS[x] == fD[x]][[1]] equUnits = fS[equPrice] 4.) Simplify[fS[price] &lt; fD[price]] with fS[price] being the **f**unction of **S**upply and fD[price] being the **f**unction of **D**emand. I'm not sure how much you know, so Solve may seem to have a strange output when using it, but for all of these, the Docs are very useful.
Okay, so I enter the function as: *f\[S\]=-800+50\*P* *f\[D\]=1900-40\*P* Is my plot command correct? *Plot\[{f\[S\],f\[D\]},{P,0,100}\]*
Only the Demand function *f\[D\]* is plotted
That's a mathematics question surely, not a Mathematica question? If you can work it out on paper.... 
Thank you so much!
When entering: equPrice = x/.Solve\[fS\[x\] == fD\[x\]\]\[\[1\]\] my output is X. : equUnits = fS\[equPrice\] returns as -800+50x
Please make a report with Wolfram. Their technical people care a lot and will absolutely go out of their way to get this fixed for the next version if there is no technical limitation. Their support is par excellence and they take bugs, flaws or limitations quite seriously. 
Thank you very much! This helped me a lot! &amp;#x200B; One question I still have is how to define the Power of the Sum of Operators: If I define my creation Operator as this: `a[k_] = qCO[k];` And then define new operators like this: ah := 1/Sqrt[2] (a[1] + I*a[3]) av := 1/Sqrt[2] (a[2] + I*a[4]) bh := 1/Sqrt[2] (I*a[1] + a[3]) bv := 1/Sqrt[2] (I*a[2] + a[4]) And then if I try to calculate the following, I'll get the right result: In[20]:=ah\[CenterDot]Ket[0, 0, 0, 0] Out[20]:= (I Ket[0, 0, 1, 0] + Ket[1, 0, 0, 0])/Sqrt[2] However if I take the square of this newly defined operator like this I get the wrong result: In[20]:=ah^2\[CenterDot]Ket[0, 0, 0, 0] // Simplify Out[20]:= (1/2 (qCO[1] + I qCO[3])^2)\[CenterDot]Ket[0, 0, 0, 0] But if I just manually apply the square, I get again the right result: In[20]:=ah\[CenterDot]ah\[CenterDot]Ket[0, 0, 0, 0] // Simplify Out[20]:= Ket[0, 0, 2, 0]/Sqrt[2] + I Ket[1, 0, 1, 0] + Ket[2, 0, 0, 0]/Sqrt[2] Is this a special case? Do I need to define the Power of a Sum of Operators in addition to that also? I thought, that by define the sum of operators and the power this would be obsolete. &amp;#x200B; Best regards, Nico
What functions have you found online? Recall that the vertex of a parabola will be either a maximum or minimum, and Mathematica has functions to find these extrema. 
Oh whoops, I was using the vertex family of functions. Thank you!
Do you go to GMU by chance? &amp;#x200B;
What have you tried so far?
Start by deriving by hand the time `Tp` denoting the period of this function. Then, use the first example on the help page of [Plot](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Plot.html) to plot the function between 0 and `2 Tp`.
This sub is riddled with these posts right now. 
I totally agree. My coding experience is limited to very basic Matlab. But I have 1) fBP\[T\_\]=100+20Sin\[((7Pi)/3)\*T\] 2) Plot\[fBP\[T\],{T,-2 Pi,2 Pi},Ticks-&gt;{{-2Pi,-Pi,0,Pi,2Pi},{-1,1}}\] I get a result, but there are many periods over this span. Even when I limit the domain to {{0,pi},{-1,1}}\] I still get too many &amp;#x200B;
Ah ok. I seem to be on the right track. I have the period as (2Pi)/(7Pi/3) = 6/7. In order to get 4 tick marks on each side I divide (6/7)/4 and get 3/14. Therefore I get: Plot\[fBP\[T\], {T, -(6/7), 6/7}, Ticks -&gt; {{-(6/7), -(9/14), -(3/7), -(3/14), 0, 3/14, 3/7, 9/14, 6/ 7,}, {-1, 1}}\] This looks good so far, but how can I label the Y axis ranging from -1 to 1
Which part?
Ok I have the Plot done correctly. How can I write the code for the max and min values? Also, determining the time interval from 0s to 1sec (x axis), determining times when blood pressure is at 100(y axis)? 
I am trying to solve when X=100 on the time interval from 0 to 1s in order to determine the times when the blood pressure is 100. What are some tips in getting started on this code? Thanks!
What code have you tried so far? Post some examples.
I have: In\[282\]:= Interval\[{0,2\\\[Pi\]}\] Out\[282\]= Interval\[{0,2 \\\[Pi\]}\] In\[283\]:= Solve\[2Cos\[x\]\^2\\\[Theta\]-7Cos\[x\]\\\[Theta\]-4==0\] During evaluation of In\[283\]:= Solve::ifun: Inverse functions are being used by Solve, so some solutions may not be found; use Reduce for complete solution information. Out\[283\]= {{\\\[Theta\]-&gt;(4 Sec\[x\])/(-7+2 Cos\[x\])}} I just dont know how to combine them
I have. I just cannot find my circumstance where I need to limit my solutions on the interval. I am very new with Mathematica, and have been teaching myself. I would greatly appreciate any help going forward to solve this problem. Im not asking for answers, simply of code functions to try, as I do not know Mathematica's.
&gt;However if I take the square of this newly defined operator like this I get the wrong result: &gt; &gt;In\[20\]:=ah\^2\\\[CenterDot\]Ket\[0, 0, 0, 0\] // Simplify &gt; &gt;Out\[20\]:= (1/2 (qCO\[1\] + I qCO\[3\])\^2)\\\[CenterDot\]Ket\[0, 0, 0, 0\] The result is not wrong (that would be worrying), it just isn't evaluated. &gt;Do I need to define the Power of a Sum of Operators in addition to that also? Kind of. We have seen that the power of a sum is already correctly evaluated in an earlier example. Before the power in your example can be evaluated, the scalar multiple must be evaluated, which does not happen. So the problem is that "scalar times operator" is not matched. If we look at our code where scalar multiples are matched: (*take scalars out*) CenterDot[left___, Times[scalar_?NumericQ, op_?qOperatorQ], right___] := Times[ scalar, CenterDot[left, op, right] ]; we see that "(qCO\[1\] + I qCO\[3\])\^2" should match "op\_?qOperatorQ". The test function is defined like so: qOperatorQ[expr_] := MatchQ[expr, qCO[_Integer] | qDO[_Integer] | Ket[__Integer] | Times[scalar_?NumericQ, _?qOperatorQ] | Plus[op_?qOperatorQ, _?qOperatorQ] | CenterDot[op_?qOperatorQ, _?qOperatorQ] | Power[qCO[_Integer] | qDO[_Integer], _Integer]]; where we see that "Power\[qCO\[\_Integer\] | qDO\[\_Integer\], \_Integer\]" is the only expression that involves powers, and that it only matches powers of "pure" operators (qCO and qDO). Note that sums are already included in the test function, so if we can match "power of any operator" (instead of pure operator), we are done. Long story short, I should have listened to myself when I said &gt;This seems to work for your examples. I'm not sure if there are cases where a pattern like &gt; &gt;Power\[op\_?qOperatorQ, \_Integer\] &gt; &gt;might be necessary (which would also match nonsense like powers of kets). in my previous reply. Modified test function (using recursion): qOperatorQ[expr_] := MatchQ[expr, qCO[_Integer] | qDO[_Integer] | Ket[__Integer] | Times[scalar_?NumericQ, _?qOperatorQ] | Plus[op_?qOperatorQ, _?qOperatorQ] | CenterDot[op_?qOperatorQ, _?qOperatorQ] | Power[op_?qOperatorQ, _Integer]]; and voilà: In[24]:= ah^2\[CenterDot]Ket[0, 0, 0, 0] // Simplify Ket[0, 0, 2, 0] Ket[2, 0, 0, 0] Out[24]= -(---------------) + I Ket[1, 0, 1, 0] + --------------- Sqrt[2] Sqrt[2]
The Solve[] function was made for "solve for x"-type problems like this. The syntax looks like this: In[1]:= Solve[2 Cos[theta]^2 - 7 Cos[theta] - 4 == 0, theta] Out[1]= {{theta -&gt; ConditionalExpression[2 Pi / 3 + 2 Pi C[1], C[1] ∈ Integers]}, (* ... *)} This gives you a list of rules that you can use to replace `theta`. However, this doesn't guarantee that 0 ≤ `theta` &lt; 2 Pi. To do that, you can make this small modification: In[2]:= In[2]:= Solve[2 Cos[theta]^2 - 7 Cos[theta] - 4 == 0 &amp;&amp; theta &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; theta &lt; 2 Pi, theta] Out[2]= {{theta -&gt; (2*Pi)/3}, {theta -&gt; (4*Pi)/3}} The change was adding `&amp;&amp; theta &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; theta &lt; 2 Pi`. The &amp;&amp; (logical AND) mandates that both the equation on the left and right must hold true. So here it was used to mandate that `theta` must fall within a certain interval, but you could also use it to put on different constraints, eg `&amp;&amp; Sign[Cos[theta]]==1`.
Mathematica is viewing Subscript as a function, not just as display, replace Subscript[v, g] with vSubg or just vg and the same with Subscript[k, c] and you will get (Sqrt[Pi/2]*Erf[(i*t*vg + (k - kc)*(\[Beta] + \[Sigma]^2))/(Sqrt[2]*Sqrt[\[Beta] + \[Sigma]^2])])/ (E^((i*t*vg*(2*kc - (i*t*vg)/(\[Beta] + \[Sigma]^2)))/2)*Sqrt[\[Beta] + \[Sigma]^2])
I didn't realize that I could contact Wolfram and have them reset the key. I have two activation keys through my school. All I saw on the user portal was that if I deactivated a key I would lose it forever, and that really ticked me off. I'll try getting in touch with them to see if they can give me a new key. Cheers.
FYI Wolfram makes a native Linux version of Mathematica. No need for Wine if you can get an activation key for the Linux version.
IIRC you need to buy a new license. 
I changed over from windows to linux and had no problem converting the key. You dont even need to talk to anyone theres a form somewhere on the Mathematica user portal to submit the request, and typically it is immediately approved./ (unless you end up reinstalling and/or distro-swapping a lot, then they might not let it be automated, but theyll still allow it).
Okay, good to know.
Yeah, for some reason we’ve been taught it was called a vertex but turning point is the proper term. Also we had to do the whole process in Mathematica so while I know about the derivative method the maximum/minimum functions were what the professor wanted us to use. Thank you though!
I think Matlab has a much larger user base at least by an order of magnitude, at least in industry. In my experience, people in industry (even those with advanced degrees) consider Mathematica too complicated. However I wouldn't consider Matlab a 'computer algebra system'. It's mostly a glorified calculator, its feature-set outside of numerical computation and graphics is very limited.
If you want my honest answer, when it comes to getting jobs, looking at market share, etc. The best ones are Python and R, precisely because of their open source nature. Companies don't want to pay the licensing for $2000+ per user, etc. and argue (correctly) that you can do any of that with Python + LibreOffice. Yeah, **you** might have gotten a copy of Mathematica/Matlab/Maple *gratis* from your school, but when it comes to sharing code with collaborators you'll find that the cost of Mathematica shrinks the user base significantly. If you're asking for purposes of getting a data analyst job, I would get Python yesterday.
If you were curious about the steps in Mathematica... f[x_] = a*x^2 + b*x + c D[f[x], x] Solve[ % == 0, x] (* x coordinate of the min/max *) f[x] /. % (* y coordinate of the min/max *) D[f[x], {x, 2}] (* min if &gt; 0, max if &lt; 0 *) 
I really hate Mathematica's dataset functionality. I've tried really hard to like it, and I'm competent with it, but I hate it... Why couldn't they have had a look at how Pandas does it! It's just such a clunky experience and using arrays is just so much easier even if I have to do more boilerplate. 
Hey, it's a nice video, but it doesn't seem to be related to *Mathematica*, the software developed by Wolfram Research Inc.
First, yes, I know that you could simply use StringReverse and it would just work the same and easier. But I found it after I wrote this. &amp;#x200B; Anyways, I'd like to know why it needs to be re-evalutated every time in order to work. When I use it for the first time it returns Null or the name of the block. &amp;#x200B; What could it be?
Because `%` does not reference the `StringJoin` line, but the previous cell evaluated: if you evaluate `2+2` and then use your function, your function will print `4`.
Simplify does it for me 
No idea why it's not working for you unless you have some global assumptions lying about. Making sure the whole thing is engulfed in Simplify[...] Or try FullSimplify
Sin^2[x] -&gt; Sin[x]^2
Still no luck. It's a fresh install; haven't set any preferences. [Simplify, FullSimplify, etc](https://imgur.com/KYqIdWn)
As another comment said: Sin[x]^2. The argument has to go with the function no matter what 
&gt; Am I doing something wrong? Yes.
Two or three or more things. First there is "hand scribbled" math and then there is "textbook formatted" math and then there is "Mathematica formatted" math and then there is "plain unformatted Mathematica" math and those are VERY different things. If you try to do as little "desktop publishing and formatting" of the math you can in Mathematica and I think that will really help you. Second, buy a cheap used copy of "Forgotten Calculus" and maybe even "Forgotten Algebra" off Amazon. Do every problem in the book as fast as you can, and then do that all over again and even again. That book and doing all the problems over and over should wake up old dormant brain cells like almost nothing else. The only complaint I've ever gotten about those books is one student wishing there was an advanced version of each.
Thanks very much for the advice. Either you are a very fast typist or you spent a lot of time on that response. I will put both of those on my Amazon list. For now, I'm watching Professor Leonard's videos and going through the corresponding chapters in my old calculus textbook. 
It worked, I appreciate the help.
Contact Wolfram support 
You need to put a \* between the things you want to multiply, or at least a space. Mathematica sees ax and one variable 'ax', not as a\*x. 
Ah, of course. Thanks.
Thanks! I have a student doing an undergraduate research project in graph theory. 
Use export function. 
Agreed. Even fucking js does it better. 
I tried that, it's broken as well.
It's very strange. A pop-out list "save as" uses a different interface than Export. So what exactly is happening when you are trying something like Export["../1.pdf", a]? 
I'm away from my PC at the moment, but I'll get back to you.
You want first order (linear) interpolation.
Piggybacking off the previous reply, either use a linear interpolation or a discrete data set to get angular lines. As for the perspective, Mathematica treats 3D objects as objects being viewed with a virtual camera; clicking and dragging will rotate the camera around the object. More objects are available via commands: ViewPoint is the position of the camera, ViewCenter is the direction of the camera, ViewAngle is the 'zoom', etc. So, once you generate your surface, you just need to "set up your shot" via these parameters (you can also specify the lighting source, specularity of the surface, etc). &amp;#x200B; [Here's an example to give you an idea](https://imgur.com/a/5xex9ZA). Note: the 'camera controls' work for any 3D object; here it's inside Show since I incorporated that green back drop as an aid, but it would work inside Plot3D, ListPlot3D, ParametricPlot3D, Graphics3D, etc. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Thank you everyone! Very helpful. I want to create my own graphics like the shirt
I am still having trouble getting it to have a wavy appearance. I tried BesselJ\[0, \_\_ \] with i and j. This gives good results but it's not as smooth.

wait, a comment causes it to evaluate correctly?
// is not a comment in the Wolfram Language, it is the Postfix Operator https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Postfix.html. It causes the result of the LHS to be passed as a parameter to the function on the RHS. In this case simplifying the expression.
Alright, thanks. Didn't actually research the language before diving into it, guess I've learned my lesson lol.
While I don't think that I could give you a direct answer, have you checked out the [documentation center](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Plot.html). Also, for help with these types of questions, I'd suggest turning to the [Wolfram Community](https://community.wolfram.com/). There are tons of very experienced users on there and you're likely to get more helpful feedback than here on Reddit.

If anyone wants to try it, here is a working example: M = {{3, -1}, {2, 7}}; v = {4, -1}; x = {10, -11}; A = {{2, 1}, {0, 1}}; A.x - A.v.M (* outputs {-10,3} *) A.x - A.(v.M) (* outputs {0,0} *) A.(x - v.M) (* outputs {0,0} *) I don't really have much time to go into details but this is not a bug. Try to print out each product to see what Mathematica is really doing. The principle is that `.` always does an inner product. Now when you write down vector `v` on paper, what do you write there? A row vector or a column vector? What would you expect if you multiply a matrix with a row/column vector? Mathematica doesn't care, since it interprets ˙.˙as an inner product it will figure it out itself.
E is the napier's constant and I is the square root of -1. If you want to use them as symbols you should [Unprotect](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Unprotect.html) them. Unprotect[E, I]; &amp;#x200B;
Further to this, N, D and O are also protected
Mathematica does not define any lower case letters. You might consider just using those. 
Unprotecting them is not recommended. Just use something else. Single letter variables are not recommended in any programming environment, except for things like iterators.
You can make Plot graphics separately, each with different colors, then combine them together with Show: p1 = Plot[1 - 1/(2 + Sin[x]), {x, 0, 2 Pi}, PlotStyle -&gt; Red]; p2 = Plot[1/(2 + Sin[x]), {x, 2 Pi, 5 Pi}, PlotStyle -&gt; Blue]; p3 = Plot[1/(1 - Cos[x]), {x, 5 Pi, 6 Pi}, PlotStyle -&gt; Green]; Show[{p1, p2, p3}, PlotRange -&gt; {{0, 6 Pi}, Automatic}] You can alternatively use `ColorFunction` to tell Plot what color to draw different points of a plot. For example: Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 6 Pi}, ColorFunctionScaling -&gt; False, ColorFunction -&gt; Function[{x, y}, Which[0 &lt;= x &lt; 2 Pi, Red, 2 Pi &lt;= x &lt; 4 Pi, Blue, 4 Pi &lt;= x &lt; 6 Pi, Green]]] Theres also a slightly shorter \\ way to do the piecewise coloring if all you need to do is slice up the domain into different consecutive intervals: domainValueToNumber[x_] := First[FirstPosition[{2 Pi, 4 Pi, 6 Pi, 100}, y_ /; y &gt;= x, 4]]; Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 7 Pi}, PlotPoints -&gt; 500, ColorFunctionScaling -&gt; False, ColorFunction -&gt; Function[{x, y}, Part[{Red, Blue, Green, Black}, domainValueToNumber[x]]]] This will color the 4 intervals with right-endpoints `{2 Pi, 4 Pi, 6 Pi, 100}` by the colors `{Red, Blue, Green, Black}`, and also use Black after `100`. Adding PlotPoints prevents Plot from doing too much automatic blending of colors.
Thank you very much! 
Thank you for the insight, my understanding now is that Dot in general is not associative for tensors of mixed rank.
You could either use the N[a] to return the decimal of a, or you could put a = 0.; to start with decimal of a.
Update: I got it to run and plot a empty Diagram &amp;#x200B;
Why do you think it is OK to post your code only as images?
First, take note that after running your code, your parameters are still undefined: anything 'new' to Mathematica will show up with blue font, until it's been formally defined (either by default or by you) and subsequently showing up as black. This is a huge hint that there's something major wrong. For one, you have some brackets/braces highlighted. That tells you that you're probably missing an open or close somewhere - here, you're missing an open brace before **t** in *loesung*. Also, it's not liking your derivatives: the apostraphe should be a flat tick. It should do this by default if I'm not mistaken - is it possible this was typed elsewhere, and copied in to the notebook, keeping the formatting? In either case, you can remove this ambiguity by using the predefined *Derivative\[\]* function instead, e.g. replace **x'\[t\]** with **Derivative\[1\]\[x\]**, etc. [Here's the Wolfram tutorial on derivative notation](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/TheRepresentationOfDerivatives.html). If you're not already, get very familiar with their documentation - it's VERY accessible and friendly.
Sry, but i figured it out myself.
In short, you have a parenthesis mismatch, and you're using the curly-&gt;'&lt;, which is not the same as the standard-&gt;'&lt;.
ListLinePlot is what you want. Just generate all the points for your plot and plop it into the function. 
Thank you!
I think the thing that does this is called thread, but I may be wrong. 
Does this work for you? g[p_]:=Array[f[#1,#2,p]&amp;,{p-1,p-1}]; g[4]
Not sure exactly what it would look like, but `MapIndexed` ought to be what you’re looking for. 
This is the solution. Btw, you can also write `f[##, p]&amp;`
&gt; Deans paper proves Einstein is wrong Why do you keep referring to yourself in the third person? This is obviously Dean's account... C'mon 
"Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem states that "Any effectively generated theory capable of expressing elementary arithmetic cannot be both consistent and complete. In particular, for any consistent, effectively generated formal theory that proves certain basic arithmetic truths, there is an arithmetical statement that is true, but not provable within that theory." Gödel's Second Incompleteness Theorem states that "For any effectively generated formal theory T including basic arithmetical truths and certain truths about formal provability, T includes a statement of its own consistency if and only if T is inconsistent."" but as dean points out http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/GODEL5.pdf 1)"there is an arithmetical statement that is true." as stated Godel cant tell us what makes a maths statement true thus his 1st theorem is meaningless. His G statement is banned by the axiom of the system he uses to prove his theorem-thus his is theorem is invalid 2) Godel 2nd theorem ends in contradiction As dean states http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/GODEL5.pdf "But here is a contradiction Godel must prove that a system cannot be proven to be consistent based upon the premise that the logic he uses must be consistent . If the logic he uses is not consistent then he cannot make a proof that is consistent. So he must assume that his logic is consistent so he can make a proof of the impossibility of proving a system to be consistent. But if his proof is true then he has proved that the logic he uses to make the proof must be consistent, but his proof proves that this cannot be done

Mathematica works with cells, each cell can contain a number of commands and can be run relatively separately as long as it is intepented from other cells. The word notebook is pretty descriptive, you can title each section of your code, write comments etc. As for sending you our projects, ain't nobody gonna do that brotha!!!
&gt;As for sending you our projects, ain't nobody gonna do that brotha!!! Yeah... I thought so. Can you point me to some (relatively) open source project?
[You can start from here. ](http://www.wolfram.com/open-materials/)
For graphing vectors there's a Vector[] function which you can use. If you wanna add two vectors, just sum them like Vector[vec1+vec2] for example Vector[{2,3}+{5,8}{
I'm not familiar with the Vector function kau\_pau mentioned. In Mathematica, vectors are just represented as coordinates: v1={v1x,v1y} (or v1={v1x,v1y,v1z} in 3D). All the usual operations work on these sets: v1+v2, v1-v2, c\*v1, Dot\[v1,v2\], Cross\[v1,v2\], etc. [I assume this is something along the lines of what you're looking for](https://i.imgur.com/6i0ay6l.png), let me know if that's not clear
Hey! Thanks a lot for the great detailed response. I do have two question though, how can I get the x and y axes on the graph? Also, why is the purple vector not just v1+v2? What does the red vector show? Thanks! 
For sure, glad to help. The axes are inherited from the ListPlot that the vector arrows graphic are combined with via Show. Something to note: as a general rule when using Show, the ultimate display options are determined by the first object; [here, if I reverse the order](https://i.imgur.com/iCXSBEC.png) ({graphic,plot} vs {plot,graphic}), you can see that the axes no longer appear. As for the second question, you need to think of it as your vector describing a *direction*, but Arrow is based on *coordinate pts*. So, in terms of setting up an arrow graphic, the vector needs to be used more as an operator. The arrow travels from p1 to p2, where p2 is the point you get from traveling from p1 in the direction v1 (p2=p1+v1). In my figure, blue and pink arrows demonstrate the direction of the v1 and v2 by drawing them as originating from the same spot. Adding two vectors yields a net direction, and so that's demonstrated by having it originating at that spot as well: Arrow\[{ {0,0} , {{0,0}+v1+v2} }\]. The red arrow is the pictorial representation of this addition. It starts at the endpoint of the blue arrow (p2=p1+v1) and travels along it's direction to the new, net endpoint (p3=p2+v2=p1+v1+v2): Arrow\[{ {{0,0}+v1} , {{0,0}+v1+v2} }\]. Note that the red arrow is parallel to the pink arrow because we're using v2 functionally the same (pn -&gt; pn+v2), where as the purple arrow is different because the summation yields a new direction (pn -&gt; pn+(v1+v2) = pn+v3).
`FullSimplify` works perfectly here. Then using the result of `FullSimplify`, for x != k\*pi the non-negativity is pretty obvious, otherwise taking the limit x-&gt; k\*pi shows that f &gt;= 0 for all x. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;

There isn't a way to do this without having a separately defined E1 and E2 that do this. Since E1 and E2 are SetDelayed functions, the outputs automatically update to find whatever a,b,c,d are, so clearing and resetting may be the best option.
A couple things: For one, you're not [using Set Delayed properly](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/8829/what-is-the-difference-between-set-and-setdelayed). The basic gist is that you use Set Delayed in situations where you don't want to set a value to something right now, but only when you ask for it later. So, a:=1 doesn't have any benefits past just using a=1, since it'll always be equal to 1 anyways. Instead, you want to [define a function](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/DefiningFunctions.html), like so: E1\[a\_,c\_,d\_\]:=a\*c/d E2\[a\_,b\_,c\_\]:=c\*b+a &amp;#x200B; When setup like this, E1 and E2 don't have any inherent values, until you evaluate them with arguments that you specifically input. Once defined, you can use them with whatever values: E1\[1,2,4\] = 0.5 E1\[3,3,3\] = 3 &amp;#x200B; You're then free to setup a function that calls another function: E3\[a\_,b\_,c\_,d\_\]:=E1\[a,c,d\]/E2\[a,b,c\] &amp;#x200B; The idea is that when you're setting up a function, the variables that you're putting in are *placeholders*, rather than tied to the specific variable. So, the example above, *a* doesn't have any particular meaning as a variable, but instead is saying to take the first parameter from the list and put it in the following places.
The best way to do what you want is by using [replacement rules](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/Rules.html) instead of values stored in variables. Like this: E1[a_,c_,d_]:= a*c/d E2[a_,b_,c_]:= c*b+a ans = E1[a,c,d]/E2[a,b,c] (* symbolic output *) rules = {a-&gt;1, b-&gt;2, c-&gt;3, d-&gt;4}; ans/.rules (*numeric output *) Rules are how a lot of solvers return information to you, too. 
Wow, that's a nice way of doing it! Thanks allot that was exactly what I was looking for!
I've used Mathematica for a long time, but I'm not particularly good at it. Have you tried [FunctionRange](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FunctionRange.html) ?
I think you should do this with **Table** and not **Do**. Functions in the language are stateless, so calling **Plot** in **Do** over and over again should print Plots in succession, but what you want are successive graphs in a plot. First make a list of the functions you want to graph using **Table**, then call **Plot** with them. Something like this should help: Table[ a * Sin[x], {a, 1, 5}] // Plot[#, {x, -10, 10}]&amp;
You want PlotRange as the option. The Ticks option sets up sets up ticks but it doesn't actually specify the PlotRange.
Alright but why does it work in the first graph? 
Because it's a program. At the end of the day, computers only do what you say, and not what you mean. Unless you're really really explicit, sometimes programs act in weird ways because it automatically assumes what you want. You specified ticks, but you didn't specify the range of values to actually show. The first plot "just works" because there's probably some low level code that selects a good range for this set of inputs. The second time, there's probably some low level code that does something totally different if you added axisLabels. Making a generic plotting library that works every time for all possible values of user input is impossible, so just try to write really explicit plot settings.
Make a function which modifies another function. Then repeatedly apply the modifier function with the NestList command. Then plot the resulting list of functions.
Thanks! I will try that

For the record, this is the adapted code including all additions from the discussion in the comments: Protect[qCO, qDO]; qOperatorQ[expr_] := MatchQ[expr, qCO[_Integer] | qDO[_Integer] | Ket[__Integer] | Times[scalar_?NumericQ, _?qOperatorQ] | Plus[op_?qOperatorQ, _?qOperatorQ] | CenterDot[op_?qOperatorQ, _?qOperatorQ] | Power[op_?qOperatorQ, _Integer] ]; (*take scalars out*) CenterDot[left___, Times[scalar_?NumericQ, op_?qOperatorQ], right___] := Times[ scalar, CenterDot[left, op, right] ]; (*sum of operators*) CenterDot[left___, Plus[op1_?qOperatorQ, op2_?qOperatorQ], right___] := Plus[CenterDot[left, op1, right], CenterDot[left, op2, right]]; (*product of operators*) CenterDot[left___, CenterDot[op1_?qOperatorQ, op2_?qOperatorQ], right___] := CenterDot[left, op1, op2, right]; (*Implement commutation relations*) CenterDot[left___, qDO[k_Integer], qCO[j_Integer], right___] := Plus[ CenterDot[left, qCO[j], qDO[k], right], KroneckerDelta[k, j] CenterDot[left, right] ]; (*Allow to use powers of operators*) CenterDot[left___, Power[op_?qOperatorQ, p_Integer], right___] := CenterDot[left, Sequence @@ ConstantArray[op, p], right]; (*effective OneIdentity attribute*) CenterDot[op_?qOperatorQ] := op; (*associativity*) SetAttributes[CenterDot, Flat]; (*implement action on Fock states*) CenterDot[left___, qDO[_Integer], Ket[0 ..]] := 0; CenterDot[left___, qCO[k_Integer], Ket[n__Integer]] := Module[ {l = Max[Length[{n}], k], nn}, nn = PadRight[{n}, l]; Times[Sqrt[nn[[k]] + 1], CenterDot[left, Ket @@ (nn + UnitVector[l, k])]] ]; CenterDot[left___, qDO[k_], Ket[n__Integer]] := Module[ {l = Max[Length[{n}], k], nn}, nn = PadRight[{n}, l]; Times[Sqrt[nn[[k]]], CenterDot[left, Ket @@ (nn - UnitVector[l, k])]] ]; The Flat attribute is needed to evaluate the following expressions: (qCO[1]\[CenterDot]qCO[2]\[CenterDot]qCO[3])\[CenterDot]Ket[0, 0, 0] (qCO[1]\[CenterDot]qCO[2]^2 + qCO[2]\[CenterDot]qCO[1])\[CenterDot]Ket[0, 0, 0]
So what I wanted to implement next was scalar product. On stackexchange I found [this](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/84619/defining-quantum-mechanical-bra-and-ket-operations): Ket /: CenterDot[Bra[x__], Ket[y__]] := Times @@ MapThread[KroneckerDelta, {{x}, {y}}] Which works quite well as we can see from the examples: In[1]:=Bra[1, 2, 3]\[CenterDot]Ket[1, 2, 3] Out[1]:=1 In[2]:=Bra[1, 2, 3]\[CenterDot]Ket[1, 2, 4] Out[1]:=0 To implement the conjugate transpose of the Ket, I tried this: SuperDagger[Ket[n___]] := Bra[n] Which works also: In[3]:= state1 = Ket[1, 2, 3] SuperDagger[state1]\[CenterDot]state1 Out[3]:= 1 In the previous code I also calculated the scalar product (which also gives the correct result). &amp;#x200B; However, my issue now is, if try this: In[4]:= state1 = 2*Ket[1, 2, 3] SuperDagger[state1] The superdagger is not able to resolve this. The same goes for switching the Times with a Plus in this expression. What also does not work is the case where I have the sum of two states: (state1+state1)^dg &amp;#x200B; Do you have any idea on how to resolve this as well? &amp;#x200B; Many thanks in advance and kind regards, Nico
Are you using \`Set\` when you should be using \`SetDelayed\`? Try writing length[r_] := ArcLength[h[t], {t,0,r}] (note the addition of the colon in front of the assignment operator). Using `SetDelayed` (`:=`) means that `length[r]` will be re-evaluated for each new value of `r`. Also note that you've already defined a numerical value for `length` in your Notebook (under the comment "calculating total distance") so you won't be able to use it as the head of a function. You'll have to use another name, such as `theLength[r_]`.
&gt;However, my issue now is, if try this: &gt; &gt;In\[4\]:= state1 = 2\*Ket\[1, 2, 3\] &gt; &gt;SuperDagger\[state1\] &gt; &gt;The superdagger is not able to resolve this. The same goes for switching the Times with a Plus in this expression. As for CenterDot, you have to define the linearity of the SuperDagger operation: SuperDagger[Times[scalar_?NumericQ, op_?qOperatorQ]] := Times[scalar, SuperDagger[op]]; SuperDagger[Plus[op1_?qOperatorQ, op2_?qOperatorQ]] := Plus[SuperDagger[op1], SuperDagger[op2]]; &gt;What also does not work is the case where I have the sum of two states: &gt; &gt;(state1+state1)\^dg If you are trying to evaluate (...)\^\\\[Dagger\] to SuperDagger\[...\], then try this: \[Dagger] /: (op_?qOperatorQ)^\[Dagger] := SuperDagger[op]
Thanks, it works better now! However, I still have some questions though: 1) If I try to this: In[1]:=state1 = 2 I*Ket[1, 2, 3] In[2]:=state2=2*Bra [1, 2, 3] In[3]:=state2\[CenterDot]state1 I get the output: Out[1]:=2 I Ket[1, 2, 3] Out[2]:=2 Bra[1, 2, 3] Out[3]:=2 I (2 Bra[1, 2, 3])\[CenterDot]Ket[1, 2, 3] In Out\[3\] it can be seen that if a Bra state also contains a factor, the scalar product won't work. Do you know what I have to add in order to fix this? 2) And another thing I noticed: In[4]:=SuperDagger[(state1 + Ket[0, 0, 0])]\[CenterDot]Ket[0, 0, 0] Out[4]:=(Bra[0, 0, 0] + 2 I Bra[1, 2, 3])\[CenterDot]Ket[0, 0, 0] In this case the superdagger also works. However, when taking the superdagger of a number, especially a complex one, the dagger has to return the complex conjugate of said numbre (i becomes -i) , although I made the following defenition: SuperDagger[n_] := Conjugate[n] By only taking the superdagger of the complex number i, I get -i as a result. However, my definition does not seem to work within the bracket. Also the scalar product with Ket\[0,0,0\] is not resolved. Do you have any idea on how to circumvent these issues? &amp;#x200B; Thanks in advance and kind regards, Nico :)
&gt;In Out\[3\] it can be seen that if a Bra state also contains a factor, the scalar product won't work. Do you know what I have to add in order to fix this? The handling of scalar factors in arguments of CenterDot is implemented by this existing definition: (*take scalars out*) CenterDot[left___, Times[scalar_?NumericQ, op_?qOperatorQ], right___] := Times[scalar, CenterDot[left, op, right]]; It doesn't apply because there is no pattern for bras in the definition of qOperatorQ. Change its definition to include one: qOperatorQ[expr_] := MatchQ[expr, qCO[_Integer] | qDO[_Integer] | Ket[__Integer] | Bra[__Integer] | Times[scalar_?NumericQ, _?qOperatorQ] | Plus[op_?qOperatorQ, _?qOperatorQ] | CenterDot[op_?qOperatorQ, _?qOperatorQ] | Power[op_?qOperatorQ, _Integer] ]; &gt;SuperDagger\[n\_\] := Conjugate\[n\] &gt; &gt;By only taking the superdagger of the complex number i, I get -i as a result. However, my definition does not seem to work within the bracket. Also the scalar product with Ket\[0,0,0\] is not resolved. Does the following do what you want? SuperDagger[n_?NumericQ] := Conjugate[n] I also noticed that there was an error in my previous post. SuperDagger is antilinear, not linear, so it should read: SuperDagger[Times[scalar_?NumericQ, op_?qOperatorQ]] := Times[Conjugate[scalar], SuperDagger[op]];
Which one should I get? There are several by Tufte on the same theme.

Oh thanks! This seems to work now! I will keep you updated if something is not working out!
Hello again! I have encountered a new problem. I make the following defenitions: testMatrix = 1/Sqrt[2]*{{1, I}, {I, 1}}; vac = Ket[0, 0]; operatorsBeforeBS = {a[1], a[2]}; transformedOperators = testMatrix.operatorsBeforeBS A := transformedOperators[[1]] B := transformedOperators[[2]] Now, If I evaluate the following code, everything seems to be fine: In[1]:=Expand[Expand[A\[CenterDot]B^2 + A^2\[CenterDot]B]^1]\[CenterDot]Ket[0,0] Out[1]:=(-(1/2) + I/2) Sqrt[3] Ket[0, 3] - (1/2 - I/2) Ket[ 1, 2] - (1/2 - I/2) Ket[2, 1] - (1/2 - I/2) Sqrt[3] Ket[3, 0] If I'll however raise the exponent of the whole bracket containing the operators from 1 to 2, the code seems to be running forever. If I then remove the \\\[CenterDot\]Ket\[0,0\] at the end I get this (due to the length of the output I post only two terms for visualisation and of which the second term is the cause of this bug in my opintion(correct me if I am wrong though.)): In[2]:=Expand[Expand[A\[CenterDot]B^2 + A^2\[CenterDot]B]^2] Out[2]:=-(1/4) I (qCO[1]\[CenterDot]qCO[1]\[CenterDot]qCO[1])^2-(1/2) qCO[1]\[CenterDot]qCO[1]\[CenterDot]qCO[1] qCO[ 1]\[CenterDot]qCO[1] by applying the \\\[CenterDot\]Ket\[0,0\] to the first term, I get the correct output. However, by doing so with the second term, which is by the way missing a CenterDot between the third and the fifth qCO\[1\], the code will not be evaluated. There are several terms within the output which are not listed where this is the case. &amp;#x200B; To solve this I tried to add `Times[op_?qOperatorQ, _?qOperatorQ]` to the `qOperatorQ` defenition. With this I was able to at least fix the bug where the code would not stop running. However the output of In\[2\] now reads (I will only post a few terms): Out[3]:=-(1/2) (qCO[1]\[CenterDot]qCO[1]\[CenterDot]qCO[1] qCO[ 1]\[CenterDot]qCO[1]\[CenterDot]qCO[2])\[CenterDot]Ket[0, 0] -3 I Sqrt[5] Ket[0, 6] + I Sqrt[3] Ket[2, 4] + I Sqrt[3] Ket[4, 2] - 3 I Sqrt[5] Ket[6, 0] Here, almost all terms of the complete output are of similar form compared the first one shown here. The term will probably is not evaluated due to the missing CenterDot. &amp;#x200B; Is there a way to extend the defenitions to achieve the evaluation of these terms? Also, was my idea to add `Times[op_?qOperatorQ, _?qOperatorQ]` to the `qOperatorQ` defenition correct, or should I ommit it? &amp;#x200B; Thanks in advance and kind regards, Nico
What's your input? A couple things popping out: 1. Your computation doesn't have a defined value for ln or eEact, so it's returning you symbolic results. If you meant to use natural log, the proper syntax is Log\[x\]. 2. Your second result is a logical expression, so it will only return True or False.
Not sure exactly what you're trying to do, but if you want a value for natural log of 98775.8, the input is In\[1\]:= Log\[98775.8\] Out\[1\]= 11.5006 Mathematica is very good at suggesting other operations after you've completed one.
Thanks! That worked!
Here's the input: https://imgur.com/a/ybpFBLk Variables are all constants except d__ which are partial differentials of Eact. [nb link](https://www.wolframcloud.com/objects/bab12671-fb92-46df-a9ff-f7a5c7f55fe0) I'm just looking for any function that will pump out a number at the end.

Ahh, I see. Thanks Harry.
I've been wondering this myself. It seems Wolfram has had [trouble making this clear](https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1096129) to many in the community.
It's supposed to demonstrate how the temperature is lowering on the square, but it keeps setting the current maximum as the red color. I would like to set something like 15 degrees as blue and 60 as red, and keep these extremes constant through the whole animation. Help please? 
Just to better demonstrate what is supposed to be happening, [this](https://imgur.com/a/PnI6R3v) is the 3D plot of the temperature function animated. You can see that the temperature keeps lowering in the other side of the square, but the contour plot doesn't show it because it is always red 
Buy range do you mean y-axis? If so I didn't see it move at all
yes, exactly
Add "ColorFunctionScaling -&gt; False" as an argument. As it says, it removes automatic scaling to the changing colors.
There are quite a few answers about vim ways in mathematica.stackexchange.com
it didn't work, now everything is red all the way. Is there a way to do something like PlotRange{zmin, zmax} for the colors?
Ok, this is a programming subreddit, you have given no input code and no error message, can you run this code in full in case there was an unexpected error? Animate[ ContourPlot[ f[x,t] ,{y,0,10} ,{x,0,10} ,ColorFunctionScaling-&gt;False ,ColorFunction-&gt;Function[Hue[#/100]] ,PlotLegends-&gt;BarLegend[{Function[Hue[#/100]],{0,100}}] ] ,{t,1,10}]
You can write directly in vim, save as a .M file and execute from a build environment, but you won't get vim bindings in the Mathematica front end, as they are not at all the same. How would you work any non-text area? Or dynamic areas? If you like vim, use vim, though I would recommend trying the standard input methods given in Mathematica.
Sorry about that, I really should've given the input code for the animation. Animate[ContourPlot[{Tpcalcr[x, y, t]}, {x, 0, Lx /. data}, {y, 0, Ly/2 /. data}, PlotRange -&gt; All, ColorFunction -&gt; "TemperatureMap", PlotLegends -&gt; Automatic, ImageSize -&gt; Large], {t, 0, tf/2 /. data}, AnimationRunning -&gt; False] *Lx, Ly* and *tf* are constants. &gt; Can you run this code in full in case there was an unexpected error? Yes, I pasted the code you wrote and it worked as expected. &amp;#x200B;
Is this really "Monte Carlo"? Sounds to me like it's just brute force minimizing the error norm. I would think some sort of genetic algorithm would probably be more effective.
Well, it is Monte Carlo in sense that models are randomly generated. Brute force usually means literally checking all possible options, which is not what is happening here. I agree re genetic algorithm, however that would make a code much more complicated. My goal was to keep it simple for now.
Reminds me of Eureqa. You used to be able to download Eureqa for free, but I just googled it, and it looks like it has changed ownership a couple of times over the years. https://www.nutonian.com/products/eureqa-desktop/
Um, how would Mathematica know when f*C2=1 before solving for f and C2? The way it's framed, it looks like a "chicken or egg" problem. Do you get any different result without "WhenEver"? If not, that condition probably isn't doing what you were hoping it would do.
Ok, i get what you're saying. But i get the exact same mistakes with or without "WhenEvent". Leads me to think there's a fundamental problem not even related to the point where f*C2^2=1
No, what I'm saying is, the singularity problem you were *trying* to address with WhenEvent is *not* addressed by WhenEvent. So you need to come up with another way to address it---either find a form of equations that doesn't have the singularity or restrict the domain of your solution.
I see. Thanks.
The parameters don't really matter as the transform will give you the same data (up to things like a scale or flip.) It's not like an ODE solver where the algorithm parameters control errors.
I use Mathematica in my courses quite a bit. I tell my students that I think the best way to learn how to use Mathematica is to start using it to solve problems. &amp;#x200B; The documentation that comes with the software is really quite good. You can modify and execute the code in the help files. However, I find searching the help files to be less useful if I don't know the specific command I am looking for. So that is where a web search comes in to play. I understand that is can be tough to know what to search for, which is why I recommend to my students to search how to solve the problem they are actually attempting to solve. &amp;#x200B; For example, suppose you want to solve a differential equation (either numerically or in closed form). Start with a Google search, "how to solve differential equation mathematica". Chances are you'll get a result from Wolfram's website or StackExchange. Take the code you find posted and start playing around with it, changing parameters, etc... That will give you a feel for what is going on. In addition, go to the documentation and find the commands used in the posted code. That will help you understand what is going on and teach you new commands. The search strategy can help beyond finding one-off commands for solving problems, you can search "if statement mathematica" or "how to create a do loop mathematica", etc... It is kind of a "scattershot" approach but I have found that it really helps my students get "their feet wet". &amp;#x200B; I encourage all of my students to use Mathematica to check their work on various problems. That is another way you can get experience with the software. Ask your professor if you are allowed to use Mathematica to check your work before doing so. &amp;#x200B; I also found this website: [https://www.wolfram.com/language/fast-introduction-for-programmers/en/](https://www.wolfram.com/language/fast-introduction-for-programmers/en/) which appears to be the introduction to the Wolfram Language. If you are looking more for programming, this might be more helpful. I haven't worked through it myself, though. &amp;#x200B; I started using Mathematica in 2002 just learning as I go. I definitely do not consider myself an "expert" in it. I am constantly finding new things that the software can do. I continue to be impressed with it. Good luck with your journey. Have patience and have fun! Don't be afraid to experiment with it. 
I'd recommend Structure And Interpretation of Computer Programs combined with Mathmatica Cookbook. The cookbook is good, and SICP is a good CS primer.
For me a lot of the barrier getting into Mathm was the syntax. I got over that by solving problems one line at a time before making more complex expressions. The one liners can be very useful, put in what ever equation you're studying in your classes; plot it, rearrange it, solve for other variables... I agree with previous post, search for how to solve.... The documentation that comes with Mathm is also good, and after evaluating an expression, gives suggestions for what to do next.
There's an online book for like $30 called Peter Taborek's Mathematica Handbook. It's very physics oriented and provides lots of practice problems that help you learn the software while applying it to real physics problems.
The wolfram demonstration projects all have code for you to download and figure out how it works. 
The Mathematica documentation has AMAZING examples that are copy pastable into Mathematica to run. Pick a subject and go play with the examples. Really fun. 
It might actually be better for me to see all the combinations in which you can cut these number of measurements from two stock lengths to see what excess I should consider. It'd even be nicer if the cutting width was incorporated into the algorithm, i.e., the saw width.
Obviously, they have similar functionality but I was thinking that the Programming Lab was more geared to newcomers
I can't immediately see how Knapsacksolve is going to do that. But perhaps you can compare the solution from that with this sawcut=1;(*choose the width of your saw cut*) allpermutations=Permutations[{56.5,56.5,56.5,102,102,120,120}+ sawcut]; allsubsets=Union[Flatten[Map[Table[{Sort[Take[#,i]], Sort[Drop[#,i]]},{i,1,6}]&amp;,allpermutations],1]]; acceptablesubsets=Select[subsets,Total[#[[1]]]&lt;=480&amp;&amp; Total[#[[2]]]&lt;=480&amp;]; uniquesubsets=Union[Map[Sort,acceptablesubsets]]; Map[{#[[1]],480-Total[#[[1]]],#[[2]],480-Total[#[[2]]]}&amp;, uniquesubsets] which gives you 13 possible solutions
How can you fan the output out to be prettier? Or highlight the excess figure to be red? Second solution for sawcut=0.125 is actually what I ended up doing.
If you append //MatrixForm onto the end of the last line of that code then it should line up the columns for you
Have a look here, these are resources I collected over a number of years.

I am a physics student as well and I'm new to Mathematica as well. I had experience with python so I used ' An Elementary Introduction to Wolfram Language ' to grasp the syntax and understand variety of Mathematica. Now I'm using an old book I found in my uni's library called ' Differential Equations with Mathematica ' . It teaches you how to solve D.Es however I think online document by itself is enough. But with the help of the book I actually had some examples to do which helped speeding up my learning curve.
Lets start with some questions: what phone do you have to run this? What phones does everyone else have (all android, assorted...)? How complex is the code? Can you show us the code? I have a few ideas depending on how those are.
Is this what you're looking for? &amp;#x200B; ParametricPlot\[{1 - Cos\[n\], n - Sin\[n\]}, {n, -2 \\\[Pi\], 2 \\\[Pi\]}\]
That's absolutely it. I didn't realize I would have to treat n as a parameter in that way. Thanks!

Hopefully that pasted ok... I can probably post it on Google Docs or something otherwise
Yep, pasted fine but you may want to put in in a code block for formatting on later posts. In short, no. The simplest way to get this code onto a set of friends phones would be to re-write it in JS/HTML, since wolfram code would need to be installed on every phone for your friends.
Well that is a bummer. I thought maybe it could be called from the cloud using coins? Though I am bot familiar with the system and have never used it before. Thank you for taking a look, much appreciated.
If you do a Google search for dice roll wolfram alpha there are widgets that someone wrote which are free to run on anyone's browser under WolframAlpha. I didn't look at all the results from that search, but it looks like most of them just add up the faces. If that isn't what you are looking for then it might be possible that you could find how to write your own free WolframAlpha widget, particularly if you already know Mathematica syntax and programming, and let everyone benefit from your idea.
I think the order of the arguments are meant to be flipped around. But indeed, the parametric plot is exactly how to do it!
Thanks, I'll look into using the widget!
By "depth" do you mean number of rows? Did you use SemanticImport? These things sometimes infer the files in a bad way that can cut the data off. My trick for this is to make a smaller subset of the data around 5 rows, then SemanticImport it. After, try and get the Head type of each column using ```data[All, (# // Values // Head)&amp;]```. This way you can load the full dataset into SemanticImport and explicitly mention the types. Along with that, explicitly mention the HeaderLines option as well as the Delimiters option.
This is for a class assignment, so I unfortunately have to do it a specific way :/ Even if I try the commands you mentioned, I definitely can't make a subset of the data. I think the Depth function refers to the number of columns, since I used Length for the number of rows.
Can you post code and the CSV if it is short, or shorten it? I haven't heard of this problem before.
From what I've found, no, there isn't really a centralized repository of knowledge from the community, only the documentation. Since you've been programming for a while, I doubt your questions are trivial, so try posting them to where ever you think they will be better suited, SE or this sub, besides that it may be a case by case basis.
 mouseData = Import["C:\\Users\\XX\\Documents\\mousebp.csv"]; resultBP = Table[ If [mouseData[[row, col]] == "AA" &amp;&amp; mouseData[[row, 1]] == "1", 1, If[mouseData[[row, col]] == "AB" &amp;&amp; mouseData[[row, 1]] == "1", 1, If [mouseData[[row, col]] == "BB" &amp;&amp; mouseData[[row, 1]] == "0", 0, If [mouseData[[row, col]] == "-" &amp;&amp; mouseData[[row, 1]] == "1", 0, If [ mouseData[[row, col]] == "AA" &amp;&amp; mouseData[[row, 1]] == "0", 0, If[ mouseData[[row, col]] == "AB" &amp;&amp; mouseData[[row, 1]] == "0", 0, If[ mouseData[[row, col]] == "BB" &amp;&amp; mouseData[[row, 1]] == "0", 1, 1]]]]]]], {row, 1, Length[mouseData]}, {col, 2, Depth[mouseData] + 1} ]; sumBP = Table[Sum[resultBP[[row, col]], {row, 1, 251}], {col, 1, 3} ] This is the part of the code I'm working with. The dataset has 251 rows and 176 columns. I'm not entirely sure why it can't go beyond 3. Most of the data just says "AA", "AB", "BB" or "-", and "0" or "1" in the first column.
The Depth function returns the number of dimensions (2 for CVS's), not the size. You'll need to use Length[mouseData[[1]]] or Dimentions[mouseData][[2]]
Thank you! I found out that I needed to use the number of columns rather than the Depth function. (I had just copied the Depth function from a previous section of the program.)
uh... you can try out functions and see what returns. It's a computer, you just type stuff and see what comes out :-) Anyways I have a question for you. What are the Depths of each of these datasets? ``` Dataset[{&lt;|"foo" -&gt; 1|&gt;, &lt;|"foo" -&gt; 2 |&gt;}] Dataset[{&lt;|"foo" -&gt; 1, "bar" -&gt; 5|&gt;, &lt;|"foo" -&gt; 2, "bar" -&gt; &lt;|"a" -&gt; Blue |&gt; |&gt;}] Dataset[{}] ``` A Dataset is a list of Associations, so the answer here might surprise you and lead you to a new way of thinking. Also, please try out Peicewise to remove the nested If statements. Those things are cancerous to programmer's eyes.
A Which statement would be more applicable here over a Piecewise.
Have you found the Mathematica stack exchange community lacking? https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/ The community prides itself on being friendly and professional? It is wise to start here, specifically: https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/18393/what-are-the-most-common-pitfalls-awaiting-new-users
Exact answer: https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Nest.html Generic answer in Mathematica: https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/ApplyingFunctionsRepeatedly.html Functional programming answer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)
[https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/For.html](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/For.html) Also, for specific applications, sometimes Table iteration ([https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Table.html](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Table.html)) works well.
I'm not getting any value change on the looped expression with the nesting, it is just doing the same operation over again without resubbing in the new value from the first loop. Though there may be an error on how I set it up. [https://imgur.com/a/Rsni974](https://imgur.com/a/Rsni974) this is the value its returning, just the first run of the loop on repeat. where A3 is my augmented matrix im applying to the expression x03
Not to go into much detail, but in Mathematica there is almost always a better solution than For. Usually Table, occasionally Do, or sometimes some other function.
Look at the poster's request. They are looking for a general looping structure with access to variable in local scope. Do is basically the same as For loop performance-wise, since it's just another loop structure with different exit condition. With pre-determined iteration count, for loop is the standard answer (again, for a general looping structure, without making use of vectorized calculations, which would be the whole point of using a software suite like Mathematica).
This is what im getting with the for loop: [https://imgur.com/a/HdZCrWL](https://imgur.com/a/HdZCrWL) Im not seeing too much in the help doc you linked as far as getting it to take the first loops value as the new x value. &amp;#x200B; What Im trying to get is a loop that outputs like this: [https://imgur.com/a/cmj8Uyc](https://imgur.com/a/cmj8Uyc) but with a loop instead of having new cells for each increment. . &amp;#x200B; Thanks
If you are using Nest like that, you need to use lambda function ([https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Function.html](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Function.html); it might be far too much trouble to learn for this). Do you need all the intermediate values in your calculation? If not, why not simply do: xn = A\^n.x0? It took me a while to realize you are just doing matrix multiplication; Mathematica knows how to handle matrix multiplications, including exponentiation.
Paste your code, not pictures of your code. Try this: x = {{275872610}, {38041430}}; A = {{0.9803306, 0.017894}, {0.0196694, 0.9982106}}; NestList[A.# &amp;, x, 20] // TableForm
is this what you are after? ParametricPlot\[{Re\[Exp\[I x\]\], Im\[Exp\[I x\]\]}, {x, 0, 2Pi}\]
&gt;x = {{275872610}, {38041430}}; A = {{0.9803306, 0.017894}, {0.0196694, 0.9982106}}; NestList\[A.# &amp;, x, 10\] // TableForm That worked out fantastic thank you! Sorry when I tried to copy and paste my code it took all my sub notation and coded it out so it looked a hot mess. i.e. Subscript\[x, i\] = Subscript\[A, 3\].Subscript\[x, Subscript\[0, 3\]\] and not sure how to stop that from happening. 
 VectorPlot[ReIm[Exp[(x + y I) I]], {x, -Pi, Pi}, {y, -1, 1}]
Nest is a head argument that is applied to f (a function), x (an initial value), and n (an integer for how many times to repeat the nesting). Is A a function?
Subscript[x, i] is the 'Full Form' - the real representation behind the scenes. The last line of the code does this: * Take an anonymous function which pre-multiplies its argument by A * Apply that function to its own results, starting with x * Repeat 10 times * Return the entire list of results
Ok that makes sense, so is there no way that a "for" loop or regular "nest" loop will use it's new argument value for each iteration? Or is that an operator symbol that denotes it to do this?
It did a thing!!!! TY
You can certainly use a For loop, it's just not the preferred method in a (primarily) function language like Mathematica.
What is 'Divergence'? I can't seem to find it defined in the documentation.
Mathematica will return a blank plot if the value given isn't a number or list.
Divergence is the vector operation. ... Of course now I remember that the syntax is Div. Although I cannot figure out the syntax for that.
'Divergence' is the operator, not the operation. It doesn't actually do anything. 'Div' is the Calculus III function that is used in vectors. What operation are you looking for? In what field?
I need to find the divergence of xy/some constant. And I can't quite figure out the syntax for the Div function.
You need to specify a box over which to plot x, y, and z. Try something like this: RegionPlot3D[{x^2 &lt;= y &amp;&amp; y &lt;= x &amp;&amp; x + y &lt;= z &amp;&amp; z &lt;= 6 - x - y, {x, -5, 5}, {y, -5, 5}, {z, -5, 5}]
Thanks ChaosCon! It solved my problem :)
May I ask how would you calculate the volumen of the body using Mathematica? Thanks for your help
One way is to integrate 1 over your region. Alternatively, you can call reg = ImplicitRegion[0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1 &amp;&amp; x^2 &lt;= y &lt;= x &amp;&amp; x + y &lt;= z &lt;= 6 - x - y]; Volume[reg]
Awesome thanks a lot ChaosCon
Found this: [link](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/5968/plotting-implicitly-defined-space-curves) Also [this](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/example/HighlightTheIntersectionOfTwoSurfaces.html) 
Simplest way would be to just cheese the [plot bounds](https://i.imgur.com/z7DFHEo.png). You could also do something similar with RegionPlot3D and ParametricPlot3D, which will be more versatile: [volume solution](https://i.imgur.com/Xp2CFaB.png), [surface solution](https://i.imgur.com/Y9tMoEf.png), [line solution](https://i.imgur.com/jwwutAL.png). [RegionIntersection](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/RegionIntersection.html) was designed to pretty much do this with minimal input from the user, but can be a bit of a pain to render smoothly. &amp;#x200B;
What doesn't work with the code Plot[2*Sin[x] Cos[x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}] ?
i am an idiot. thank you
These are all kind of terrible. They don't work that well and they rely too much on high-level functions instead of mathematics. The closest thing to scientific computing is a basic Plot3D. WTF happened to this company? They used to be brilliant. 
If you want some astoundingly rich plots of complex functions, check out this stack exchange thread on creating domain coloring plots of complex functions: https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/q/7275/43617 More than a simple one- liner, but they are astoundingly beautiful (both aesthetically and mathematically).
I'm having trouble guessing what you meant to do. Have you already defined z[0],...z[50]? Note: if text appear blue it is being treated as an unquantified variable/object. So min[] isn't the same as Min[], the function which returns the minimum of its input(s). Do you want to find r and k? Are you treating r and k as fixed ahead of time? Or do you want your function to depend on r and k? In the latter case, you probably want to define z[t] using z[t_, r_, k_]:= I can be of more help if I know what you're trying to accomplish. I'm mostly confused about whether you want the z's in the function's definition to be the same as the z you are defining. Like, to calculate z[2], do I evaluate the whole thing at t=2, or what?
It looks like you want the Minimize function, an to fix the syntax errors, remove the [t_] and replace t with #. I can't do much more with just a picture of some text and no output.
I am looking for the values of r and k that minimize the sum of all of the differences, so I guess technically I want to treat them as variables. 
Not sure on the exact mathematics on this, but a common error is with the Subscript function, which sometimes has math errors as it isn't a single Symbol. Also see [this](https://blog.wolfram.com/2011/03/01/stabilized-n-link-pendulum/).
Hi! Thank you. In the meantime I also posted the question over at mathematica.stackexchange as well. I got a very good answer there. it's [here](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/192366/using-parametricndsolve-with-n-subscripted-functions/192372?noredirect=1#comment500842_192372) if you're interested. Your blogpost-link is very interesting. Good to see how other people tackle the same/similar problem. I haven't thought about stabilizing the pendulum though. But I don't really know about the StateSpaceModel function. gotta read up on that next. 
it's taking nx as one variable. Just make it n*x
That was it, thanks!
You can also make it `n x`, but the space is important,.
It seems faster that way, thanks!
you can use do it by " integral table method"
I'd recommend Select[privArrayTest,Between[privArrayC]] or if you just need a bool value, AnyTrue[privArrayTest,Between[privArrayC]] along with that, many of these functions seem redundant, like Map[invert], as the invert functions already automatically threads over lists parallelResist[arrayInTest_,arrayInCompare_]:=Module[ {privArrayTest,privArrayC,tolerance}, tolerance[x_]:=x(1+.05{-1,1}); privArrayTest=1/Total/@Subsets[1./arrayInTest,{1,\[Infinity]}]; privArrayC=tolerance/@arrayInCompare; Select[privArrayTest,Between[privArrayC]] ]; as many of these variables are only used once, you could probably even just remove them and turn the whole thing one liner.
Thanks for the code simplification! Select seems like an interesting function, may have to look into using that if I cannot find a suitable replacement for ContainsAll. I need the function to return True (or a list) only if all equivalent list elements are satisfied. ContainsAll worked when I matched (manually) the machine precision, but that was without the tolerance. The parallelResist will be looped through many times, searching for a success, incrementing through a master list
 tol = 0.05; possibleresistances = 1/Total[1/Rest@Subsets[resistors], {2}]; A = Outer[ {equiv, resistance} \[Function] Between[resistance, (1 + {-1, 1} tol) equiv], equivalence, possibleresistances ]; And @@ Or @@@ A
in the case that you need All of the of the equivalent list elements, use AllTrue[privArrayTest,Between[privArrayC]]
You seem to have come across a bug, to fix the plot's range, add , PlotRange -&gt; All to Plot P1 = Plot[Piecewise[{{1 - Cos[2*Pi*x], x &lt; .5}, {2, x &gt; .5}}], {x, 0, 3}, PlotRange -&gt; All]
I'd also recommend reporting this bug, to help for the next version
ListPlot. Next time instead of posting a picture of your code, post actual code we can copy and paste to try out.
The code contains data from a file on my computer so I didn't think it would post because I had to import data. The numbers I want on the X-Axis are 2013,2014,2015,2016,2017 and their corresponding totals 1328,1447,1431,1199,962. So I guess it would look like this: (2013,1328), (2014,1447), (2015,1431), (2016,1199), and (2017,962). I tried ListPlot and put the points in but it kept giving me errors
I don't believe this is something to can do live while the code is running. What you could do is make a full dataset of points you want to show, then write a manipulation that plots from 0% to 100% of your full dataset, then autoplay the manipulation.
I know it can be done while running. I have already done it in other contexts. I will post some sample code later
The top right entry in your description of the problem is 0.5. But the top right entry in your mathematica code is 0. Which is correct?
The code was correct, just made a typo. I just fixed it, thanks for noticing!
Show us what you've done so far?
Please post the commands you have tried along with any error messages you might be receiving, as well as what you want the program to do.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Mathematica/comments/azzmvw/pertaining_to_my_last_post_ive_entered_a/ I haven’t gotten error messages; hell, I’ve gotten nothing.
For starters, you need to hit Shift+Enter to actually run anything. Hitting enter only adds a new line. Give that a try and see what comes from it.
*Now someone tells me even a hint of this shit*
If you're going to be using mathematica a fair amount (and it looks like you probably will), you'll want to get familiar with their help docs. For how big mathematica is, they're very thorough and accessible. For instance, the first line of the first page from their ['Getting Started' tutorial](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/GettingStartedOverview.html) tells you about how to evaluate your code and what to do from there. Here's the page for the basic [Plot command](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Plot.html), which explains what syntax it needs, how to format it, and what options are available. 
Thanks!
You don't have a Mathematica problem, I think you have a [very old and famous *math* problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casus_irreducibilis). The number *i* is unavoidable here, but they all cancel out. For example, compare the results of `Solve[(-2 A - 2 B + (-2 + 4 A B) x + (2 A + 2 B) x^2 + x^3 /. {A -&gt; 1/3, B -&gt; -5/4}) == 0, x]` and `NSolve[(-2 A - 2 B + (-2 + 4 A B) x + (2 A + 2 B) x^2 + x^3 /. {A -&gt; 1/3, B -&gt; -5/4}) == 0, x]` Even though *i* appears, the roots are real. To be more certain, you can ask Mathematica something like `FullSimplify[ Element[(Root[-2 A - 2 B + (-2 + 4 A B) #1 + (2 A + 2 B) #1^2 + #1^3 &amp;, 3] /. {A -&gt; 1/3, B -&gt; -5/4}), Reals]]`
You receive long and complicated answers because the `ToRadicals` function expresses the `Root` objects produced by the `Eigenvalues` function as radicals. The output of the `Eigenvalues` function is three `Root` objects, i.e., `val = Eigenvalues[{{-A, 1/2, 0}, {1/2, 0, 1/2}, {0, 1/2, -B}}]` gives `{1/2 Root[-2 A - 2 B + (-2 + 4 A B) #1 + (2 A + 2 B) #1^2 + #1^3 &amp;, 1],` `1/2 Root[-2 A - 2 B + (-2 + 4 A B) #1 + (2 A + 2 B) #1^2 + #1^3 &amp;, 2],` `1/2 Root[-2 A - 2 B + (-2 + 4 A B) #1 + (2 A + 2 B) #1^2 + #1^3 &amp;, 3]}` which is the first, second, and third root of a cubic equation. Use `ContourPlot` to visualise the eigenvalues: `ContourPlot[val[[1]], {A, -2, 2}, {B, -2, 2}, PlotLegends -&gt; Automatic, ContourLabels -&gt; True]` `ContourPlot[val[[2]], {A, -2, 2}, {B, -2, 2}, PlotLegends -&gt; Automatic, ContourLabels -&gt; True]` `ContourPlot[val[[3]], {A, -2, 2}, {B, -2, 2}, PlotLegends -&gt; Automatic, ContourLabels -&gt; True]` Exact values can be found by replacing A and B: `val /. {A -&gt; -2, B -&gt; 2}` gives `{-(3/Sqrt[2]), 0, 3/Sqrt[2]}` Although, some choices of A and B don't give clear results, e.g. `val /. {A -&gt; -2, B -&gt; 0}` gives `{1/2 Root[4 - 2 #1 - 4 #1^2 + #1^3 &amp;, 1],` `1/2 Root[4 - 2 #1 - 4 #1^2 + #1^3 &amp;, 2],` `1/2 Root[4 - 2 #1 - 4 #1^2 + #1^3 &amp;, 3]}` &amp;#x200B;
I meant complex as in real and imaginary parts, I'm sorry if that wasn't clear, but I still really appreciate your answer.
Wow! I had no idea this was a possibility, I guess I have some reading to do, thanks!
Also, if you want help from this forum, it's helpful to post the code of your notebook. It's a lot easier to debug code when you can immediately run it.
Alright. I was using Reddit on mobile though 
the words in problem description section are being interpreted as variables. surround it with (* problem description.. alts... *) 
Use NSolve instead of Solve
What he said
&gt;Solve\[(5.35/V\^2 - 1.265661056)\^-0.5 == -2.0\* &gt; &gt;Log\[10, 2.477\*\^-4 + 2.51/(99600.7984\*V (5.35/V\^2 - 1.26566)\^0.5)\], &gt; &gt;V\] That didn't work either, i figured it out by using Find Root with a ballpark friction factor of 0.1 i think the reason why it doesn't work is the Colebrook equation is iterative so it was stuck in a loop (my guess) unless you give it a convergence limit.
Wait, what are you solving for? What's vars? Are the values in A and B known or unknown? If you're trying to solve for the values of x you'll need more than two equations if it is of length greater than 2. Are all of these vectors the same dimension? If so you can just use the dot product. 
apologies I think this should actually be a fit not a solve, arrayA and arrayB are known values, vars are a number of coefficients ... everything is the same length.
Why would it be a fit? You can just do the dot product ArrayA.x == 13 so get a clearer view of what you'd be solving for. But, if you have more variables than equations then the system cannot be solved.
perhaps findinstance would be better commands basically I know that ArrayA.x == 13 ArrayB.x == 37 all values of x are positive and x[i+1] &gt; x[i]. There are multiple answers to this I'm just looking for any solution
I just can't be much help without more info. But so x doesn't depend on the variables you're solving for, or it does? And only in some positions? Because if all values in x were unknown you'd need Length[x] equations
Sorry for the confusion I have actually solved much of this myself as you actually have been super helpful... the only question I have left is if you know of a way with the find instance command to set the restriction that each solved for value of x must be smaller than the next i.e. given an Array X of length 45 x[0] &lt; x[1] .... x[44]&lt;x[45].
try ineqs=Table[x[i] &lt; x[i + 1], {i, 1, Length[x]-1}] eqsAll=Join[eq1,eq1,ineqs] FindInstance[eqsAll,vars]

You can right click the cell and "copy as LaTex" or you can use "File &gt; Save as &gt; .Tex" to save the whole file.
variable "tmax" in the code is defined or is it the one of parameters? anyway,the following should meet your request. f[x_, y_] := y; g[x_, y_] := -0.2 y - 9 Sin[x]; sol = ParametricNDSolveValue[{x'[t] == f[x[t], y[t]], y'[t] == g[x[t], y[t]], x[0] == x0, y[0] == y0}, {x, y}, {t, 0, tmax}, {tmax, x0, y0}]; vecSol[tmax_, x0_, y0_] := {sol[tmax, x0, y0][[1]][#], sol[tmax, x0, y0][[2]][#]} &amp; &amp;#x200B; &gt;vecSol\[1,1,1\]\[1\] =&gt; &gt;{-0.727579, -1.73238} &amp;#x200B;
I should have mentioned that I am using the free cloud version, but I do not seem to be able to do any of the things that you listed. When I right click I only get the chrome right click menu but if i hit the gear in one of the cells i have some options to copy, but sadly none of the options are LaTeX. When i go to File there is not a save as button. There is a download button but that does not let me change it to .Tex. Is there anything else that you know to try? 
Thanks! Seems like an easy enough fix. tmax is defined in my code, because I'm using it to see if a solution to the system of equations converges to a critical point. This will help me find the basin of attraction for a particular critical value.
Have you tried using `Integrate` or `DSolve` to solve the system of Euler-Lagrange equations?
Post your code, not pictures of your code.
Specialized outdated software is required to run CDF. Wolfram completely abandoned it. Don't touch CDF with a 100-miles long stick. Use cloud deployment instead and just embed an iframe into your webpage. https://reference.wolfram.com/language/workflow/CreateInteractiveContentForTheWeb.html
ExportString[///CODE////, "TeX"]
Thanks, also do you think Python Dash or R Shiny will be better, where you can containerize the app using docker and deploy it? Does Mathematica have a similar functionality?
Wolfram hosts an app on their services and you just embed an iframe to their address. You need to pay for this, but it is cheap if you don't have a lot of users. If you don't need specifically Mathematica, I would go with a Python/JS/R (depending on the functionality you need) solution 100%! 
Not on my computer but two things: Abs has double square brackets, should only have one pair. The condition in the If statement has a triple =, should only be double. 
The `func` is missing a `_` in the head, also is never used. the `Abs` has two brackets on it The double / triple equals could go either way, as triple equals is valid, but double equals is more correct here.
When I get home I’m going to check it. Thanks !!
because I also wanted to write this algorithm,just modified it. is this enough?

Good first troubleshooting step would be to run FileNames\[\], which will tell you all the files in the directory, so you can at least sanity check that Mathematica does indeed see it. Also, this will show you what Mathematica calls it in case it's a weird syntax thing (.tif vs .tiff or something). Also, what's the command you're using to import? If it's just plain Import\[\], you shouldn't have much issue, but I can see things getting weird if your prof's code is specifying some element/option that doesn't apply to your photo.
Wow that’s super useful! thank you! Her command looks like “ filename = “blahblahblah—.jpg”; Import[filename, “Elements”] Import[filename] data = Import[filename, “Data”]; colors = ExampleData[{“TestImage”, “Lena”}, “Data”]; I can’t find anywhere in the slides why Lena is referring to. That’s not her name. And she only tells us to use our own image instead of hers. My image now shows up (I restarted mathematica and it worked) but it doesn’t run the channel display later on, it still outputs her original image. Which is weird, because when I execute this part it outputs my image so clearly my image is imported. I assume I have to change something else further down probably but if I don’t even understand this part I should get this straight Do you know what the “ data = “ part is referring to? Filename is my image file, but data with quotes? I’m lost 😅
Since you said you're new, I'm gonna err on the side of you not knowing somethings, so apologies if I sound pedantic. A couple general Mathematica tips: * Ending a line with a semicolon suppresses the output, and commands in the same cell will all evaluate at the same time. If you're trying to figure out an issue, a good step is to run each command individually in its own cell, without a semicolon, to make sure each are behaving how they should. * If you're running into problems with older outputs persisting, restarting the kernel (Evaluation-&gt;Quit Kernal-&gt;Local) will clear out all the definitions without having to restart. * Mathematica's online documentation is actually pretty kickass - there's a page for each command, and generally will at least skim over all the associated options. [Import](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Import.html), [.jpg](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/format/JPEG.html), [ExampleData](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ExampleData.html), [FileNames](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FileNames.html) As for your code: filename = “blahblahblah—.jpg”; Defines a filepath to your image that'll be neater to use, especially if you're going to be using it a few times Import[filename, “Elements”] This will look at the file, and determine which particular pieces of data you're able extract from it individually. Import[filename] Brings the full file into Mathematica. It'll determine what type of file and how to handle it automatically - for example, your jpg will import as a graphics object, but an excel document will import as a table of data. data = Import[filename, “Data”]; "Data" should be one of the Elements that shows up as available. Here, instead of importing the image itself, you're importing the individual pixel data as a table of data. This might be more convenient depending on what you were looking to do. colors = ExampleData[{“TestImage”, “Lena”}, “Data”]; This is a little distinct from everything else. Mathematica's got a library of example stuff that are there if you need something to play around with when trying to figure out the ins and outs of a new function. Run ExampleData\[\] and it will give you a list of the available types of data; ExampleData\["TestImage"\] will give a list of all the available test images; run ExampleData\[{"TestImage","Lena"}\] to see this particular example - it's actually a [pretty famous go-to image processing example image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna). Like the earlier example though, the "Data" at the end is telling it to import the pixel data. Good luck! The more you dig, the more you'll end up appreciating how [absurdly extensive](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/ImageProcessing.html) Mathematica is. &amp;#x200B;
This was so so so helpful oh my goodness. Thank you so much! I really appreciate how much time you took to explain everything so thoroughly. Thank you!!
It seems that you have entered [\[RightArrow]](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/character/RightArrow.html) instead of [-&gt;](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/character/Rule.html). Replacing \[RightArrow] with -&gt; in the code should bring you closer to something working. 
Try this model=RevolutionPlot3D[Piecewise[{ {100000000000 x, 0&lt;=x&lt;=.0000000000139001}, {.77498 x+1.39001, .0000000000139001&lt;=x&lt;=0.5}, {-.25*(x-1.8)^2+2.2, 0.5&lt;=x&lt;=0.5}, {2, 0.5&lt;=x&lt;=6}, {-.5*(x-6.6)^2+2.18, 6&lt;=x&lt;=7.276393203}, {-.9x+8.5, 7.276393203&lt;=x&lt;=8.5632298105}, {Sqrt[0.8^2*(.9-((x-8.8)^2/.4^2))]+.2, 8.5632298105&lt;=x&lt;= 8.896204334}, {-.04 x+1.29, 8.896204334&lt;=x&lt;=9.61366}, {Sqrt[0.9^2*(1-((x-9.5)^2/-.49^2))]+.03, 9.61366&lt;=x&lt;=10} }], {x,0,10}, Mesh-&gt;1, RevolutionAxis-&gt;"X"]; Export["ProyectoParcial.stl", model]
Okay, so you know the coordinates of your 6D-Cube? If the answer to this is yes, you can project these coordinates to 3D-Space by using [vector projection](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_projection). If you have done this, you can redraw the edges and should be done.
Thanks a lot!!! This was exactly the problem!!
I believe the coordinates are as such on the wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6-cube so I take these, put them in to a vector projection and add dimension to it?
Yeah, that should work. If you want to feel fancy, you can apply a 6D rotation matrix before your projection. This leats to interesting (read: trippy) visuals.
Can you not just limit your plot domain to positive numbers? It's not entirely clear to me what you're trying to do. If you don't have flexibility with the domain and need it accomplished in the equation, you can set it up with a conditional or as a piecewise function: If\[x&gt;=0,Sqrt\[x\],0\]
No, I can't, that's the point. Technically, I'm trying to draw using equations, I use square roots to limit the length of various lines, and I can't use fancy stuff like `If`s because of _some reasons_.
Can't you just do Re[sqrt(X)]?
Nope. `Re[Sqrt[-1]]` evaluates to 0, but I need negative values to make the whole equation invalid.
If you can't use \`If\`, then you probably can't use this either, but I think the right answer is the recently-added \`Surd\`. \`Surd\[25,2\]\` returns \`5\`, but \`Surd\[-1,2\]\` yields the message \`Surd::noneg\` and returns \`Indeterminate\`.
You can use conditional definitions to achieve this properly, i.e. `f[x_]:=Sqrt[x]/;x&gt;=0` 
Not entirely sure what the desired behavior is, but how about Abs[Sqrt[x]]? Or maybe Sqrt[Abs[x]]? Based on your description I understand you want some kind of different behavior for x&lt;0. Are you trying to make a [RELU](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)?wprov=sfti1) perhaps? 
Well...what do you want sqrt(-1) to return if not i? I'm very confused as to what you want. 
Nothing. It must be unevaluated
This post would be greatly helped if you could post your code and what exactly you want to happen. As someone else commented, you could Unprotect sqrt and redefine it but for it to return Indeterminate or to not evaluate negative numbers would require an If statement. The reason this question is so hard to answer is because you said the usual workarounds don't suit: choosing the real part, taking absolute values, squaring the argument etc. *Why* do you need it to simply "not evaluate" negative numbers rather than just returning something that can be discarded?
As u/Associahedron had pointed out, `Surd[x, 2]` does exactly what I want. The problem with my task is that it's very hard to explain for me because I don't know international mathematical terminology.
Are you aware of [ListPolarPlot](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ListPolarPlot.html)? It sounds like that's exactly what you're looking for (although with the order of the coordinates swapped).
Nope, I was not aware of that. I looked for it, but somehow completely missed it. Thank you very much.
Do you want the output to be ultimately an image, or data still? If you want an image, Binarize\[Image\[array\],thresholdlevel\] is a clean way of doing it.
you can use a list of rules, though the 'Binarize' stated below would be better it looks like. im /. {x_ /; x &lt; threshold -&gt; 0), y_ /; y &gt;= threshold -&gt; 1 }
Consider turning your image into an Image object, this gives you a whole bunch of image processing functionality that's useful. The Binarize solution proposed by /u/ayitasaurus is then the right one. If for some reason you don't want that, you can try the following: im = Boole@Map[(# &gt; threshold) &amp;, im, {2}] In general, using pattern matching to manipulate large data structures is questionable. It's slow, and almost always there is a better way of doing it.
That's exactly what I needed. Thx.
Binarize is a great fit. But it's also good to know how to do a list of rules. Thx for your help.
Excellent point to highlight! Was curious to see how much faster it would be - turns out even if you convert to an image, binarize it, and, convert it back to data, [it's still &gt;60x faster](https://imgur.com/a/TutygSp) than trying to work with the data piecewise.
Wow. That's remarkable. Thanks for running the test. I'm very bad at writing efficient code. As an engineer I usually only care if it works... I really need to get better at it.
I really wouldn't worry too much about timing - the slower version still only took less than a fifth of a second, so you would spend a whole lot more time trying to optimize the code than you'd 'waste' just using it. These types of effects generally aren't appreciable unless you're dealing with something really large, or if it's used for something that's dynamically updating. If you really want to get more efficient, I'd suggest focusing more on things involving code-writing itself, since the neater and more concise things are there, the easier it is to troubleshoot and tweak down the line. Plus, I've found myself needing to use similar processing later down the line, so it's great to be able to open a notebook to grab that function. Personally, I noticed my greatest improvements when I got **really** comfortable working with lists and defining/using functions - these two alone can dramatically improve the quality/legibility of code. Going a step further, you can then Map\[\] a function to run over a list, which helps for cases where you need to apply something over multiple parameters. [Here's a quick example of this, using what I did before](https://imgur.com/a/8myR6aA). First line sets up the image dataset to work with, and the second sets up a custom function that will generate a thresholded image, based on an image dataset and threshold level that you specify. The beauty of this is now that it's defined, it can be used anywhere in your document by the name alone, rather than having the full code copied; you can assign names to the outputs to use them further, or you can even make new functions that call those functions. If you wanted this applied with different threshold levels, you can then Map\[\] this function to run over a list that you input (either as a predefined and named list, or directly in Map\[\] itself. The output is a list that you can save and recall from later as needed. (Hope this isn't too rudimentary for you!)
I can't tell what you mean by 'strictly Cartesian', the Animate function doesn't use a coordinate grid, it just changes a variable. What about: Animate[PolarPlot[Sin[2 x + a], {x, 0, 10}, PlotRange -&gt; {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}], {a, 0, 5}]
Animate isn't strictly cartesian or otherwise, but rather it's whatever you assign it to be, depending on what you're wrapping it around and what you're defining as the variable. As long as you set it up properly, it should be able to handle just about anything. [Here's a quick example with polarplot](https://imgur.com/a/Cc5qEL3) \- if you give some more information I might be able to point you in a closer direction.

How can I go from a ListPolarPlot?
 Animate[ListPolarPlot[Table[Sqrt[n],{n,i}]],{i,1,100,1}] and if that isn't what you are trying to do then can you be much more clear and specific about what you are trying to get?
 Animate[ListPolarPlot[Table[{n, Log[n]}, {n, a}]], {a, 0, 500}]
I'm trying to do a gravity simulation. SetOptions[Graphics, AspectRatio -&gt; Automatic, Axes -&gt; Automatic, PlotRange -&gt; {{-pos[[1]], pos[[1]]}, {-pos[[1]], pos[[1]]}}]; Animate[Show[Graphics[{GrayLevel[0.33], Disk[{0, 0}, 2*M]}], Graphics[{PointSize[0.02], Blue, Point[{Npos[\[Tau]][[1]], Npos[\[Tau]][[2]]}]}]], {\[Tau], 0, \[Tau]f, \[CapitalDelta]\[Tau]}]
 pos={10};\[Tau]f=10;\[CapitalDelta]\[Tau]=0.1;Npos[r_]:={10*Cos[r],10*Sin[r]}; SetOptions[Graphics, AspectRatio-&gt;Automatic, Axes-&gt;Automatic, PlotRange-&gt;{{-pos[[1]],pos[[1]]},{-pos[[1]],pos[[1]]}}]; Animate[Show[ Graphics[{GrayLevel[0.33], Disk[{0, 0}, 2*M]}], Graphics[{PointSize[0.02], Blue, Point[{Npos[\[Tau]][[1]], Npos[\[Tau]][[2]]}]}] ], {\[Tau], 0, \[Tau]f, \[CapitalDelta]\[Tau]}]
Hit "Right Enter" or "Shift + Enter" to evaluate a cell....
I’ve learned that since this post, I just didn’t know at the time because nobody really taught me the basics of how to use that program in class
Can you remove the CapitalDelta part and use a variable? I'm not sure whether `n` is a variable or part of the Symbol you're trying to update.
Like so? Do[m[n] = 1 + n, {n, 0, nf, m[n]}]
As I said, this is just a simple test case for what I'm trying to actually do in a script I'm writing. I realize that a Table could achieve what this test case is doing easily, but there's just way too much going on in my actual script for that to work.
Dn[n] is going to need to be a constant, as the 'n' in the step is outside of the scope of 'n' in the 'Do' loop. My only thought is to redefine m[n] as a function of n instead of 'recursively'.
Hmm, so like this? m[n_] = 1 + n; Do[m[n], {n, 0, nf, m[n]}] That doesn't work either.
Ok so let's talk this through. It looks like you want to replace m[n] with n +1 for each value of m[n], but at intervals of nf. For example, if you ran this function at [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] for nf being 2, you'd get... ``` [ 2 (1 + n where n is 1), 2, 4 (1 + n where n is 3), 4, 6 (1 + n where n is 5) ] ``` Is this right? If this is right, there's a few things to change. First, to update a list you need `x[[n]] = ...;`. You have `x[n] = ...` which is not how you update a list. It's there for a reason actually. You shouldn't update a list in Mathematica because it's designed to be functional. Second, you need to change your Do iteration bounds. You have `{n, 0, nf, m[n]}` which I believe means "n from 0 to m[n] by nf" but that's not it. It needs to be `{n, start, end, by}`, and start, end, by need to be integers. Can you come up with the integers for `Do[ ..., {n, start, end, by}]`? How can you make it to work with m's `Length`?
No, that is not what I'm trying to do. I want the step size of the function to change with each iteration. Such that on the first run, the step size might be 1, then on the second run the step size would be 2, then 3, 4, 5, and so on. This is just a simple application of something I intend to use in a more complex script.
If you want the step size to change with each iteration, you might need another iteration. It sounds like you want to iterate through step sizes, and for each step size, iterate through the List by the step size. Take a look at below. ``` m = Table[x, {x, 1, 10}]; Do[ Do[ Print[m[[n]]], {n, 1, Length[m], gap}], {gap, 1, 5}]; ```
What exactly are you expecting this to do? Your code just defines a function 'm' for some values of 'n', but always as n+1. A do loop has no output. Could you just write it as a while loop? n=0; While[n&lt;=nf, m[n]=n+1; n+=m[n]]; which is the same as: n=0; While[n&lt;=nf, m[n]=n+1; n=2*n+1]; I'm away from the kernel, but that may be the same as: n=0; Do[m[2^n-1]=2^n, {n, 0, Log2[nf]}]; is the same as: m[n_]/;IntegerQ[Log2[n+1]]:=n+1; also, function definitions have a colon: m[n_] := 1 + n;
That's very very close to what I'm trying to get! Still not quite there though. Each step of the inner Do[] should have a unique step size. As you have it, it runs through the entirety of the inner Do[] for each value of "gap", but I want it to only take a single step using each value of "gap" So given what you set up there, the output I want should be: "1, 2, 4, 7", if I'm not mistaken.
I want a loop that increases the step size with each iteration. It's difficult for me to express what I want in any more precise of language because I don't know how to do that.
So "one step for every gap" is the same as "for every point". How is what your asking any different than using Do or Table with the correct iteration bounds?
For Do or Table, they take a constant step size. That step size can be any value of course, but it's going to remain the same throughout the entire function. E.g.: Do[Print[x],{x,1,10,2}] outputs: "1, 3, 5, 7, 9" A constant interval of 2 between every step. What I want should vary the step size. E.g.: Do[Print[x], {x,1,10,y}] Where for each iteration of the Do loop, y takes on a new value. Your script has y take on a new value not for each iteration, but for each complete cycle of the Do loop.
If you want a loop that changes step, then you can't use Do or its derivatives, use a while loop: &amp;#x200B; n=min; While\[n&lt;=max, block; n+=step\]; &amp;#x200B; like the first example
That seems to work! Thank you very much! Now I just need to figure out exactly how to implement this into the script I already have. Shouldn't be too difficult, but famous last words. Thanks again!
Yeah so that leaves a few questions. If that's really right, Do iteration alone probably isn't what you want. It essentially acts like a for loop, and for loops are supposed to keep the same-ish step size. You could possibly work this out in some programs, but I don't know a way to do this in Wolfram. Let's try a different approach. Do expressions start at x = 1. Then it runs for x = 1 + y, then it runs for x = 1 + y + y. So if you want to "add more to the step size, you're looking for something like x = 1, then x = 1 + a, then x = 1 + a + b. Is this right? Let's call these the 'indexes' if it is right. Instead of using a Do loop, if you have a closed form solution for what 1 + a + b + ... should be, the indexes themselves, why not generate a list of those first, then use them in a Table or Do loop explicitly? Let's say your index list is, {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32}. You can just run ``` m = Table[x, {x, 1, 50}]; (* Generates a list of 50 elements *) indexes = {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32}; (* here's a list of the indexes I want. Powers of 2 *) Do[m[[n]] = "Foo", {n, indexes}]; (* For each index, change m at powers of 2 to "Foo" *) ``` The point here is if you know the indexes you want to manipulate, instead of writing a Do loop to calculate the indexes for you, just make the indexes yourself separately.
Or that! Glad you found and answer here.
Thanks for your help, but somebody else already helped me get where I want.
Can you take a look at my projection subroutine please? I can plot the vertices and show up in 3 space, but I can't seem to get the coordinate skeleton to show. Proj[{x_, y_, z_, u_, v_, w_}, p_, q_, r_] := {x, y, z}/((p - u) (q - v) (r - w)) c6pedg = {}; Do[c6pedg = Append[c6pedg, {Proj[c6edgf[[i, 1]], 8., 4., 2.], Proj[c6edgf[[i, 2]], 8., 4., 2.]}], {i, 1, 192}] c6pedg; Length[c6pedg] cyls[scale[c6pedg, 800], 1.5] and then i run this ph = .5 (Sqrt[5] + 1); pbasisx[pt_] := Projection[pt, {1, ph, 0, -1, ph, 0}] pbasisy[pt_] := Projection[pt, {ph, 0, 1, ph, 0, -1}] pbasisz[pt_] := Projection[pt, {0, 1, ph, 0, -1, ph}] OrProj[vec_] := {pbasisx[vec][[1]], pbasisy[vec][[3]], pbasisz[vec][[2]]} rvert = {}; Do[vr2[i] = OrProj[v6[i]]; rvert = Append[rvert, vr2[i]], {i, 1, 64}] Length[rvert] scl = 30; sp1 = Show[Graphics3D[Sphere[scl rvert, .52]], Axes -&gt; True, AxesLabel -&gt; {X, Y, Z}]; Length[c6edgf] c6pedg = {}; Do[c6pedg = Append[c6pedg, {OrProj[c6edgf[[i, 1]]], OrProj[c6edgf[[i, 2]]]}], {i, 1, Length[c6edgf]}] c6pedg; cube6 = Show[sp1, cyls[scl c6pedg, .52], PlotRange -&gt; All, BaseStyle -&gt; {EdgeForm[]}] I keep getting an error that the "CoordinateSkeleton should be a triple of numbers, or scaled form" but all my coordinates are in (X,Y,Z) "Axes -&gt; True, AxesLabel -&gt; {X, Y, Z}}], cyls[{{{-13.416407864998737`, -13.416407864998737`, \ -13.416407864998737`}, {-5.124611797498107`, 0.`, -13.416407864998737`}}, {{-13.416407864998737`, \ -13.416407864998737`, -13.416407864998737`} ...... etc"
that came out all in one block, not in wolfram language
What are you actually trying to do? Is there any reason you can't, for example, name the LHS of the first equation a, the right hand side of the first equation b, then use c and d for the second equation and then just write a-c==b-d ? The solve command doesn't work like you're trying to make it work. Here's a link to it's documentation: https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Solve.html
I'm trying to mimic this sequence done in a Ti in Mathematica. I just summarized it for simplicity, basically when subtracting the equations, the results should come out as a linear equation instead of a quadratic. As by subtracting one equation from the other should eliminate the quadratic part of it. [https://imgur.com/a/XgINn3m](https://imgur.com/a/XgINn3m)

Ok, It definitely works as a-c==b-d.
Mathematica can evaluate it for any concrete natural number n, but apparently cannot evaluate it when n is a parameter, even if you explicitly tell it that n is a natural number. The latter is useful in general though, you can do that with "Assume". However this is a rare case when it is much easier for humans than for the software: The substitution x -&gt; Pi/2 - x is a simple mirroring of the graph to a vertical axis, which even leaves the integration interval [0,Pi/2] fixed, hence the integral will be same if you replace x with (Pi/2-x). On the other hand, sin(x-pi/2) = cos(x) and cos(x-pi/2) = sin(x), hence after the substitution you get cos(x)^n / (sin(x)^n + cos(x)^n) ). But the integral must be the same as per above. Adding together with original version, you get the integral of 1 over [0,Pi/2], which is pi/2; but this is just the double of the original integral, so that must be pi/4. Finally, you can check for concrete n-s (say 0,1,2,3,4,5) with Mathematica, and indeed it says pi/4 for all of them.
Somewhere in the code you have written something like `z[n]` where z turned out to be a real number and n was some kind of counter for your 80 numbers. Without seeing what you have written I imagine you can estimate how difficult it is for someone to tell you where you have done that and how to change it. If the code is small and simple enough to edit onto the end of your post then someone might be able to point where you need to delete three characters.
Rather than go back and fix part of my code (this really isn't for anything important), do you know how I could basically truncate each table entry to remove this last bit?
Precisely what does `FullForm[...yourtable...]` show? That might tell us whether you have one long ascii string or numbers followed by characters or who knows what you have.
How about `Head/@yourTable` ?
Uh... that doesn't do anything
No change
I found where the problem rooted from. It was exactly what you said. Thanks.
Nvm, problem sorted.
 StringReplace["{85.5022[1], 86.2872[2], 86.5573[3], 86.6379[4]}",RegularExpression["\\[\\d*\\]"]-&gt;""]
thanks a lot for the explanation, helped a lot.
The complex plots seem neat
Wolfram Blockchain? When moon?
&gt; (Version 12.0 doesn’t yet have high-dpi support for Windows, but that’s coming very soon.) Ugh.
What's your big-plus feature in v12? Mine is Around[]. Having to wait for HDPI support on Windows is a pain.
Mathematica amazes me with its capabilities, but *still* no symbolic matrix/vector calculus.
A cocoa frontend for MacOS. The GeometricScene feature is quite nice too.
We aren't going to do your homework for you bud. &amp;#x200B; In any case. I think first realizing sorting the lists and searching might help. I'll give you another hint: It might be better to merge some of these lists together.
This isn't homework, thanks. The elements are already sorted, and merging tables would defeat the purpose of this. It would be great if someone has a nice little solution for me, but if not, then leads are also great. I'm somewhat competent with Mathematica - I just have no clue how to do this in particular.
I'm not that good at Methematica, but I could manage it by using Flatten and Tally to get the common elements, then a bit of pattern-matching and Position on the results. I doubt is the best method but for small tables should work. I'm not sure it will scale well with many tables or large tables: In[56]:= tables = {{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15}, {11, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90}, {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14}} Out[56]= {{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15}, {11, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90}, {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14}} In[57]:= tflat = Flatten[tables] Out[57]= {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 11, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, \ 90, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14} In[58]:= ttally = Tally[tflat] Out[58]= {{1, 1}, {3, 1}, {5, 1}, {7, 1}, {9, 1}, {11, 3}, {13, 2}, {15, 1}, {20, 1}, {30, 1}, {40, 1}, {50, 1}, {60, 1}, {70, 1}, {80, 1}, {90, 1}, {0, 1}, {2, 1}, {4, 1}, {6, 1}, {8, 1}, {10, 1}, {14, 1}} In[59]:= dupes = Cases[ttally, {_, y_ /; y &gt; 1}] Out[59]= {{11, 3}, {13, 2}} In[60]:= dupes2 = dupes /. {x_Integer, _} -&gt; x Out[60]= {11, 13} In[61]:= pos = Position[tables, #] &amp; /@ dupes2 Out[61]= {{{1, 6}, {2, 1}, {3, 7}}, {{1, 7}, {3, 8}}} I would love to see a more efficient way to solve it.
This definitely works at least for a small number of tables. I haven't tested it for a bigger set quite yet. Thanks a bunch! That sort of weird notation like "{_, y_ /; y &gt; 1}" and "/. {x_Integer, _} -&gt; x" is exactly the sort of stuff that I have zero understanding of. I would have never gotten this.
I tried with large random tables and the first part is pretty quick, but the last Position takes forever. If you need to process large tables, then another method is needed. The "{*, y* /; y &gt; 1}" and "/. {x\_Integer, \_} -&gt; x" is pattern matching and pattern replace. It is key to understand and use Mathematica, and one most powerful features in Mathematica. Definitely worth investing some time on them!
I just spent a few minutes looking at documentation. [Position](ref/Position) does exactly what you're looking for: [In] = Position[lists, 11] [Out] = {{1, 6}, {3, 7}}
Thank you. /u/siritinga beat you to the punch, but I still really appreciate the help.
No problem. Yep, saw it. Given that there’s a built-in for this, I’d use it over reinventing the wheel. But that’s just me. :)
Fine, if it isn't homework... ``` MapIndexed[Pair[#1, #2[[1]]]&amp;, t, {2}] // Flatten // GroupBy[First] ``` This returns an Association where each Key is the value, and the Values are the list of Pair values. From here I think you can take over. You can query this Association and determine values that have more than one Pair, and also immediately see the indexes of those values.
You can pass n&gt;=5 as an assumption to Integrate (though I'm not sure if it makes a difference in this case). Integrate[..., Assumptions-&gt;{n&gt;=5}] Keep in mind that the natural logarithm, `ln(x)`, is written as `Log[x]` in Mathematica.
Check out my comment. Not sure why it's downvoted but if you think of this list as a list of lists, you can just use ```MapIndexed```. It maps over values and applies a function to each value, but also supplies the index. I think the requirement is to get the index of the list the duplicates are in. This way you don't have to get the dupes then re-query for the position of the duplicates. After that it's a round of flatten and group by because Map/Reduce style is good.
I'll do that, thanks! And thank you for the heads up
It worked as you wanted?
Yes it did, thanks!
Which version does it state in your account on users.wolfram.com?
11.3 I'm with a university, if that matters.
My guess is it'll depend on your university - I got an email this afternoon saying it was available
Position gives you that, yes, but you need to find the 11 first.
Hmm, okay. I just figured that universities would have a subscription that auto-upgrades.
Then you need to wait until the university distribution gets updated. There’s usually a delay. Alternatively you can request a trial of Mathematica 12 use that in the meantime, until you get a new license.
Ah, right, but I figured /u/Deadmeat553 already figured that part out. Oops :)
I downloaded it no problem, but I'm on an individual student license. I had to accept the v12 license on my licenses page; once I did, the download link was presented. If you can't accept the license, then I'd guess there's something about the university license that needs to be managed by its administrator ... you'd be better off contacting your school's IT support at that point.
Around is huge, but huge-er if it works with differential equations.
I think they release licenses to people incrementally
finally included plots with built in error bars...
Do you need help with Mathematica or help with Simpson’s rule?
That was built in before actually. You had to load it via 'Needs["ErrorBarPlots`"]' it was a bit cumbersome but it worked. However, now its clearly better and more convenient.
Try running `Clear[x]` and then rerunning the code?
As /u/mszgedy says, you probably have active definitions for symbol *x* or perhaps *f*. This is an often-made mistake in Mathematica interactive sessions. To see what your Mathematica session knows about a symbol, try to enter the symbol preceded by two question marks. As user /u/mszegedy indicates, you can clear definitions on a symbol using the Clear[] function. Alternatively, quitting Mathematica (or just its kernel) and re-executing commands will ensure a clean environment with no user-defined symbols.
I've since figured out that OP's result is the exact result that you get when you run OP's code with &gt; x = E^(I \[Omega])/(Sqrt[2 \[Pi]] \[Omega])
Yea yea much easier now tho
How are you inputing the subscripts? You’ll need to use the Notation package if you want a sub scripted variable to be treated as a regular symbol.
I am inputting them with ctrl+shift+[minus/underscore]. I also tried leaving v naught as regular v, and still doesnt work.
Yeah, just use plain text variable names v0, vx, vy, etc., and you'll be better off.
The problem is that the function inside `ParametricPlot` must explicitly depend on the parameters being manipulated. Therefore, redefining `r[t_]`, as `r[v0_, a_][t_] = {A, B}` and `A = v0 * Cos[a] * t, B = v0 * Cos[a] * t - ...` And then calling it `r[v0, a][t]` inside `ParametricPlot` . As /u/Jabernathy also mentioned problems with sub scripts usage, it is generally a good idea to avoid using sub scripts, unless you really know what you are doing.
If I understand correctly, you are trying to plot projectile motion. I wouldn't go to the effort of making a function declaration for this. I'd just put the equations for _x_, and _y_ directly in the argument to `ParametricPlot`: g = 9.8; Manipulate[ParametricPlot[{v0 t Cos[theta], v0 t Sin[theta] - 1/2 g t^2}, {t, 0, time}, PlotRange -&gt; {{0, 500}, {-200, 500}}, PerformanceGoal -&gt; "Quality"], {{v0, 20}, 1, 200}, {{theta, Pi/4}, 0, Pi/2}, {{time, 20}, 0.1, 40}] One thing I note is that your function declaration `r[t_] = {A, B}` does not use the customary `SetDelayed` notation, i.e., it uses `=` instead of `:=`. I don't know if this was intentional.
Thank you so much, it works! Though this is not at all for my grade, do you have any explanation why this works over what I tried?
The [reference information for `Manipulate`](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Manipulate.html) states, in the _Possible Issues_ section, &gt; `Manipulate` only "notices" explicit visible parameters and gives an example similar to what you are trying to do. The solution is to redefine the function to include all parameters explicitly. For example, g = 9.8; f[v0_, theta_, t_] := {v0 t Cos[theta], v0 t Sin[theta] - 1/2 g t^2}; Manipulate[ ParametricPlot[f[v0, theta, t], {t, 0, time}, PlotRange -&gt; {{0, 500}, {-200, 500}}, PerformanceGoal -&gt; "Quality"], {{v0, 55}, 1, 200}, {{theta, 1.16}, 0, Pi/2}, {{time, 13.75}, 0.1, 40}]
There is something in your x. Factor[f[x]] ist evaluated accordingly. You can tell by the way it is. (The "x" is colored black instead of blue) Running ClearAll[x] once should solve your problem.
Thanks! This is correct - was messing around with Fourier stuff the night before and didn’t realize the attributes could carry over to a new blank test notebook. Problem is fixed now. Thanks for everyone’s help!
And what exactly is your problem?
Are you able to key `g(x)` in? Mathematica uses square brackets to define functions. Variables are implemented with underscores. Here's the beginning of the definition of `g`. You'll need to fill in the `&lt;...&gt;` part. g[x_] := &lt;...&gt; Mathematica documentation for [defining functions](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/DefiningFunctions.html).
These are courses that will rely on Wolfram's computer algebra system [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/)? This sub is about that piece of software.
If I had to guess, probably easier than standard calc classes where you have to do everything by hand. Software just provides good sanity checks for answers. When I took calc, I did a lot of homework in calc III and diff eqs in Matlab. After a certain point, I would just turn in my homework using the software. It definitely provides much better insights into the problem when you have a tool that can do symbolic integration. That being said, it could be difficult if you aren't familiar with any programming language. I just wrapped up my grad level calc class where I did all of the homeworks using Mathematica and it wasn't terrible at all, but I also had plenty of experience since I'm a software engineer by trade.
Thank you, I understand now
Many online courses will have the input sections for homeworks/problem sets and tests be mathematica windows inside of the page. I don't think they're asking if math courses are harder to take online, but if it's harder to do work in that fashion.
I always prefer in person lectures, but if your only option to take the class is online and they use mathematica, it shouldn't be too bad. Mathematica is relatively intuitive to learn for beginners. It also provided experience if you intend on going further in math or physics which can be very helpful. I used mathematica for most of my undergrad career and it made everything easier.
The natural logarithm in Mathematica is `Log[z]`. Try that instead of `ln(z)`.
Ok thank you, I will run the numbers. One moment.
This is what I got. ---------------------------------------- d = ((dep + ltdebt)^(-rf*xt))/v h1 = (0.5*sigma^2*xt - log[d])/sigma*xt^.5 h2 = (0.5*sigma^2*xt + log[d])/sigma*xt^.5 RP = log[(1/d)*z1 + z2]*(-1/xt) -(log[z1/d + z2]/xt) z1 = CDF[NormalDistribution [0, 1], h1] z2 = CDF[NormalDistribution [0, 1], h2]
The `Log` function has uppercase letter `L` not lowercase letter `l`. When that's corrected I get `-0.38126` when I execute your code with your original numbers.
I'm not sure about using Mathematica to script crypto attacks, I could see it being done, but I'm not familiar enough with crypto attacks to say whether or not it's a good idea. You mentioned you're currently using Sage; you can import a Sage script into Python and in Python use Matplotlib (or another data visualization library) to make the visualizations you want.
Thanks for your answer ! I didn't though about matplot combined with python for graphic representation, I'll give it a try :) Mathematica look like a powerful tool, and I've seen some showcases of cryptographic manipulation. I'm concerned about this because Mathematica could be a great tool to work in a more mathematical aspect than scripting with sage. The best thing is undoubtedly to use the free trial to make sure it's usefull enough for me.
Rest of it: when g(0)=10 and g’(x)=0
Use `DSolve`. The function g(x) is written `g[x]`, g'(x) is written `g'[x]`, and e^(-x) is written `Exp[-x]`.
The precision of `DateList` is provided by the `$TimeUnit` symbol. On my system it's `1/100`.
You're sooo lazy, it's unbelievable
At least post the code you have so far
Just as a pointer to some resources that might be useful, 1) If you haven't already, you should check out this guide page: [https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/Cryptography.html.en](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/Cryptography.html.en) In particular, if you check out the page on GenerateAsymmetricKeyPair there are examples for some basic cryptographic protocols. (There has also been some new functionality here in v12 that just came out,) 2) Because you mention quantum computing, and graphic circuit representation, you should check out this package developed by Jacob Marks as an intern at Wolfram: [https://github.com/jacobmarks/quantum\_computing](https://github.com/jacobmarks/quantum_computing)
Yes, I understand it is not a bug, but a "feature". But I was wondering is there some other way to go around this limit.
I'll check these out, thanks for your answer :)
\&gt; Yes, I understand it is not a bug, but a "feature". Not a feature. Documented behaviour. ;) It's surprising that expressions of this form also lose accuracy: DateList[{2018, 3, 3, 15, 38, 0.001}] I wasn't able to find a workaround, aside from manually parsing your date string.
Your BinAmericanPut\[\] worked for me without modification. Maybe you just need to restart your kernel
and what about the BinAmericanPut1D and the BinAmericanPut2D ? because they are supposed to work as a chain. &amp;#x200B; but thanks for your help
Well I'm getting an error that you're trying to reset the input variable steps1. It doesn't make much sense to have that as an input and then set it anyway. Also, I don't know what values to try for your inputs. Have you tested each line outside a module to make sure theyre all doing what you think they should?
What I wanted to do was to have a total number of steps and then inside them a function that act until steps 1 and other until steps 2. Maybe that way mathematica would assume that division but is not happening
`Max[148.314,0. + 0.500172 Max[141.192,0.500172 Max[118.422,0.49484 Max[141.192,80.1149 + 0.500172 Array[180.735, 161.901][[3]]] +0.500172 Array[Max[161.901,89.435 +0.500172 Max[141.192,80.1149 + 0.500172 Array[180.735, 161.901][[3]]]], Max[141.192,80.1149 + 0.500172 Array[180.735, 161.901][[3]]]][[3]]] + 0.49484 Max[161.901,89.435 +0.500172 Max[141.192,80.1149 + 0.500172 Array[180.735, 161.901][[3]]]]]]` &amp;#x200B; Now, gives this result. Fuck
For some languages f(x) can do things inside f like x=0.5*x. In Mathematica all parameters are "constant" inside a function and cannot be changed so steps1 = 0.5 steps inside BinAmericanPut1D is fatal. But you could do stepsx=.5steps and then use stepsx instead. Next. please provide all the constants needed for one very simple example use of your functions that works and what the result should be. Then provide very very very slightly more complicated example constants that doesn't work and what the result of that should be. Maybe with that someone can track down the problem.
Google mathematica Binomial Black-Scholes to find lots of what looks like relevant answers
Why didn't I think about it? Silly me. I have searched but most of the results are interactive models.
I've found again and again that the examples put up are just like what you found, big complicated interactive graphical things with way too much effort spent on fonts and italics. What I wanted was a simple function with clear documentation on exactly what format data to give it and exactly what format result to expect back. Sorry it didn't work for you.
Did you find it?
I didn't look further because I almost certainly wouldn't realize I found it or understand Black Scholes even if I did find it. I don't know if you were rude, I wouldn't be able to tell unless you made it REALLY obvious. I hope I didn't seem rude. I didn't mean to be. So I hope we are both fine. I think I understand your being annoyed with this and I've been the same. I wish we could get the attention of Wolfram to push people into including the non-interactive and documented function onto the end of each of their demos and examples and dancing graphical do-dads, but I doubt we could accomplish that.
You can use the StreamPoints option: StreamPlot[{1, -2 y + 2 Cos[x] + 1}, {x, 0, 5}, {y, -2, 5}, StreamPoints -&gt; {{{{2, 1}, Red}, Automatic}}] Alternatively, you can use NDSolve (DSolve would also work in this specific example since the equation can be solved exactly) to obtain a solution and show it on top of the stream plot sol = NDSolve[{y'[x] + y[x] 2 == Cos[x] 2 + 1, y[2] == 1}, y[x], {x, 0, 5}][[1]]; p1 = StreamPlot[{1, -2 y + 2 Cos[x] + 1}, {x, 0, 5}, {y, -2, 5}]; p2 = Plot[y[x] /. sol // Evaluate, {x, 0, 5}, PlotStyle -&gt; Red]; Show[p1, p2] I'll leave it to you to figure out adding more than one point.
Oh, wow! That's perfect. Thank you. I'm not sure why I missed that in the documentation.
r/HomeworkHelp
What have you tried so far...?
Literally everything, my struggle is the format of what I’m trying to plot and actually getting it to graph. My only resource is the internet since this wasn’t taught to us at all
Anything that I’ve found on the internet I’ve tried to edit/plot
Yes. But its easier to use the lognormal distribution instead. (because it gives the distribution when the number of steps approaches infinity) &amp;#x200B; It is this one: PDF(x) = (1 / (b \* x \* Sqr(2 \* PI))) \* Exp(-.5 \* (( Log(x) - a) / b) \^ 2) &amp;#x200B; "PDF" = Probability Density Function (of the underlying asset) in which a = Log(spotprice \* Exp( ( r \* time) - .5 \* (vol \^ 2) \* time ) ) b = Sqr( vol \^ 2 \* time) &amp;#x200B; r=interest vol= volatility Time is measured in years. ie 3 months means: time= 0.25
And that Works for discrete dividends?
No, dividends are not involved here (But they are not in Black-Scholes either)
And what's the PI?
PI is the mathematical constant 3.14159... (etc.) x is the price of the undelying asset/ It is lognornally distributed. When the starting price = (e.g.) 100, then over a year you can expect is to be someting between, say, 75 and 130 (or more) or something, depending of the volatility and interest. x is the gradual scale here. It could be 75. it could be 130, it could be in between (or even more). When the option call price is (e.g.) 110, then this function denotes the probability if and how much the option is in-the-money.
I get it. Thanks. But that means that it doesn't give the true value of the option. Only the probability of becoming x.
You should apply some mathematics, called (numerical) integration on this formula. When you know the probabilities of the price of the underlying asset exactly, then you can exactly compute the value of call and put options...
Ok. Thanks for all the help. If I have some doubts again I'll text you here
Unfortunately, my teacher wants a binomial black scholes for options. Do you have any file that you can share with me to understand better?
This model is the result of a binomial model in case of the number of binomial steps goes to infinity.If your teacher disagrees, he is a lousy teacher...
There's nothing wrong syntactically, but your equations are too complicated for it to solve. If you think there is in fact a solution (because it's a homework problem for example), my first guess would be that you have an error in your algebra. It's hard to say, the way you've defined all the terms is really complex.
Normally ODEs are solved using `DSolve`. [https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/DSolveIntroduction.html](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/DSolveIntroduction.html)
I'm not sure whether Solve can handle inequalities (it never used to). Try using Reduce instead (it will give a highly verbose but rigorous solution). You may also read the documentation about solving linear systems if that's what this boils down to. Surely Mathematica can handle this problem.
In addition to the other hints, please write (1/2) instead of 0.5. The latter is a numerically approximated value that is treated differently from the 'infinite precision' expression (1/2). Solve doesn't deal very well with numerically approximated values.
Assuming this is an ordinary algebraic problem and not a differential equation problem, NMinimize[{dx^2+dy^2,0&lt;=x&lt;=1&amp;&amp;0&lt;=y&lt;=1&amp;&amp;ep&gt;=0&amp;&amp;0&lt;=mu&lt;=1},{x,y,ep,mu}] then it rapidly finds an approximate solution. Replacing 0.5 by 1/2 and including the WorkingPrecision option finds more precise and different solutions. With the 1/2 substitutions this Reduce[dx==0&amp;&amp;dy==0&amp;&amp;0&lt;=x&lt;=1&amp;&amp;0&lt;=y&lt;=1&amp;&amp;ep&gt;=0&amp;&amp;0&lt;=mu&lt;=1,{x,y,ep,mu}] very quickly finds large complicated solutions. Removing ep and mu from the variable list seems to slow that down greatly.
What is BinAmericanPut \[\]? Anyway,This should be helpful. [http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/PricingPutOptionsWithTheBinomialMethod/](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/PricingPutOptionsWithTheBinomialMethod/)
I can see the following problems. 1. `i` and `j` are not declared local to the `Module`. It should be something like `Module[{dt, a, u, d, P, Q, TreeOp, value, steps1, i, j},`. 2. The `BinAmericanPut` function isn't declared anywhere. I suspect you intended to call `BinAmericanPut1D`. If that's the case, you didn't supply enough arguments when calling the function. `BinAmericanPut1D` takes eight arguments, but the call to the `BinAmericanPut` function is supplied with only six arguments.
[Use F#](http://fsharpnews.blogspot.com/2010/07/f-vs-mathematica-fast-pricer-for.html).
Its a rather niche thing, but an orthogonal NonlinearModelFit would be awesome. So that I can specify Weights for the y-Residuals AND x-Residuals. This is a very delicate subject and each FitModel would need a symbolic preprocessing as far as I know. There is a Mathematica Package which can do this for a*x+b functions only (YorkFit I think). It would be absolute AWESOME to have that for every function. No program and/or language I know has that. Also two small things: - FittedModelObject should be able to return a VectorAround as a keyword. - AroundReplace should issue a warning when it doesnt evaluate because it sees an Around with upper and lower error. But all in all. MMA12 is extremely nice to work with. And Around[] is a saint and saves me tons of work.
Matrix calculus.
Regarding comments, I agree that the `(* *)` syntax is not optimal. I prefer by far inserting text between the cells (with Alt+7 if I remember correctly). It is a nice way to alternate text and code in a literate programming fashion.
Better support for graphs. There is some nice functionality, but there are also gaping holes, e.g., support for multi graphs with edges that have distinct labels. Read more: https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1321057
I would love if the lines on line graphs could get wider and fainter as the error on a value increases. [Sorta like this, but not shit.](https://i.imgur.com/34cT3wJ.png)
I've not needed this functionality yet, so I didn't know it wasn't built in yet. I'm honestly shocked. Is there at least a package out there that does this?
I have not tried 12 yet but if they haven't added a better mechanism to export plots and figures in a publication ready format then that is a dissapointment for me. At the moment I have to export my data and jump into gnuplot to redo the figure I spent already a lot of time for...
And why does [this](https://i.imgur.com/U40sIfk.png) happen when I set a PlotRange other than "Full"? Losing the outer border and degree markers.
You need to post the code for us to help you. It looks to me like the plot is getting clipped. You can add padding in various ways, or rather, to various _things_. Around the entire Graphics object: Plot[x^2, {x, -2, 2}, ImagePadding -&gt; 10] Around the graph itself: Plot[x^2, {x, -2, 2}, PlotRangePadding -&gt; 10] Several more similar features are [described here](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/PlottingAndImageRegions.html).
Probably the same reason as in the other plot: they're getting clipped.
ImagePadding didn't work. https://i.imgur.com/VCQsvtd.png
I'm not absolutely sure what you're trying to do, but I suspect you are not using the `Convolve` function appropriately. Convolve with multivariate delta functions has the following form Convolve[f[x, y], DiracDelta[x, y], {x, y}, {r, s}] which gives f[r, s] So, for your problem I would write something like DiracDelta[x - mc[[1]], y - mc[[2]]] + DiracDelta[x - mR1[[1]], y - mR1[[2]]] + DiracDelta[x - mR2[[1]], y - mR2[[2]]] + DiracDelta[x - mR3[[1]], y - mR3[[2]]] + DiracDelta[x - mL1[[1]], y - mL1[[2]]] + DiracDelta[x - mL2[[1]], y - mL2[[2]]] + DiracDelta[x - mL3[[1]], y - mL3[[2]]] + DiracDelta[x - mU[[1]], y - mU[[2]]] + DiracDelta[x - mD[[1]], y - mD[[2]]] ThreeDnd[x, y, \[Sigma]1, \[Sigma]2] conv = Convolve[%%, %, {x, y}, {r, s}] Plot3D[conv /. {\[Sigma]1 -&gt; 5, \[Sigma]2 -&gt; 5}, {r, -500, 500}, {s, -500, 500}]
Unfortunately, I still get the same output and error
Well, as someone who has used the iOS app, you're not missing much
I wasn't aware that there was an iOS version of Mathematica. I can't find any mention of it online.
Well, Wolfram Cloud, which is a full Mathematica notebook, completely run server-side, and it's horribly buggy and laggy
Yeah, Android also has that. I'm talking about a locally run version of Mathematica for Android.
If you know the norms of the numbers, I think it's best to just add those as extra equations (e.g., `a * Conjugate[a] == normOfa &amp;&amp; normOfa &gt;= 0`). If `Reduce` can do something useful with the norms, it will. Other than that: symbolic computation is a bit of an art, even with a tool like Mathematica.
Thanks! I’ll keep fiddling with it!
 [https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/PiecewiseFunctions.html](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/PiecewiseFunctions.html)
Give me something I can copy and paste.
I tried this ratio=2; t0=1; tp=t0/ratio; Table[FindMaximum[{(1/(1-(t0-tp)^2))(Cos[2Pi x/t0]-Cos[2Pi* x/tp]),0&lt;=x&lt;=2},{x,z}],{z,0,2,1/8}] which gave me {{1.5, {x -&gt; 0.2098}}, {1.5, {x -&gt; 0.7902}}, {0., {x -&gt; 1.}}, {1.5, {x -&gt; 1.2098}}, {1.5, {x -&gt; 1.7902}}}
Thanks! I'm having trouble understanding the results. Is that saying that at x=.2098, y=1.5?
PlotMe is just a variable I use to store an equation. It is shown in Out\[1002\]. When I use Output\[1002\] in In\[1003\] it works as expected. However when I just use PlotMe in place of %, it simply gives an error. What's going on?
Yes ratio=2; t0=1; tp=t0/ratio; Plot[(1/(1-(t0-tp)^2))(Cos[2Pi x/t0]-Cos[2Pi*x/tp]) ,{x,0,2}]
Plot the expression you're trying to find the maximum of and you'll see that FindArgMax does find a local maximum, it's just not *the* maximum. expr0 = (1/(1 - (t0/tp)^2))*(Cos[2*Pi*x/t0] - Cos[2*Pi*x/tp]); Plot[expr0, {x, 0, 3}] The message returned by FindArgMax isn't strictly an error message, it's just informative. To find the maximum you have to constrain the search region then evaluate the expression at the point returned by FindArgMax. xmax = FindArgMax[expr0, {x, .4, .4, .6}] expr0 /. {x -&gt; xmax[[1]]} {0.5} 0.666667 PS. Your Piecewise expression is undefined at x==tp and defaults to 0.
You could also use `FindMaximum[expr0, {x, .4, .4, .6}]` which gives `{0.666667, {x -&gt; 0.5}}`.

In R optimize will search for a minimum. If you squared the function you want to find the root of and it was real over the interval where you want to search and it was nice enough that it didn't have too many difficulties with local minima then optimize might find the location of a root for you
Do you think it works with this code? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; `BinAmPut &lt;- function(S,K,r,sigma,t,steps) {` &amp;#x200B; `dt=t/steps` &amp;#x200B; `a=exp(r*dt)` `u=exp(sigma*sqrt(dt))` `d=(1/u)` `P=(a-d)/(u-d)` `Q=1-P` `P=P*exp(-r*dt)` `Q=Q*exp(-r*dt)` &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; `tree &lt;- vector(mode="numeric",steps+1)` &amp;#x200B; `for (j in 0:steps) { tree[j+1]=max(K-S*(u**j)*d**(steps-j),0)}` &amp;#x200B; `for (i in (steps-1):0){` `for (j in 0:i){tree[j+1]=max(` `P*tree[j+2]+ Q*tree[j+1] , K-S*(u**j)*d**(i-j))` `}` `}` &amp;#x200B; `return(tree[1]) }`
As sincerely politely as I can put it, like all the other ways that you have asked this similar question, since no one but you has any idea what any of your data is or what any of your parameters are or what the result should be, I don't think that anyone can answer your question. I understand there must be a reason that you don't want to tell anyone what the needed information is to be able to answer your question. If you have an R question then perhaps you would be slightly more likely to get a useful answer if you asked it in a forum dedicated to R.
Then give them an honest try and ask specific questions if you need help. Nobody here is gonna just supply you with fully worked out answers to apparent exam questions for free.

Hard to give advice without code to work off of
Sorry--rookie mistake posting a screenshot. I tried posting it all as code. Let me know if it works.

Sorry, I was trying to condense from a broader assignment. It should show everything now.
If you generate some discrete data points as your measurement, you can use `NonlinearModelFit` to fit you model to a data set. The easy way to do this is using `ParametricNDSolve` (insead of `NDSolve`). It generates a parametric function as a solution which can be seamlessly used in `NonlinearModelFit` as your model. Look at this simple example: [https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/126143](https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/126143) You might be interested in this book, which contains relevant Mathematica program codes. [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781493986439&amp;i=stripbooks&amp;linkCode=qs](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781493986439&amp;i=stripbooks&amp;linkCode=qs)
Aw man this is so out of my league So when you say "fit your model to the data set", would that mean figuring out how to extract the horizontal asymptote fro my model each time it runs? The basic idea here is I need the "steady state" of the model to be stored in the program so that I can extract the standard deviation and mean from a large collection of these values. I don't know where to begin with storing an abstract value like the horizontal asymptote, and I'm sorry to say that a lot of what you linked is over my head. I'm a lowly neuroscience major who has been thrust into this programming role.
You can obtain the steady state in this case just evaluating the solution at the last point: Table[X[t] /. Xnnar[[i]] /. t -&gt; 100, {i, 1, 100}] Then you can do statistical analysis on this set.
Sweet. That produced numbers! Okay we're getting somewhere So I would take this table and do the `LinearModelFit` function on it, and it should give me the coefficient of variation? I guess the last issue is how do I make the statistical output for coefficient of variation the y value in a plot which uses one of the parameters in the original equation as the x value--something that will show the changes in the steady state as you change ß, k or n (I need to make 3 different plots).
Okay so I managed to calculate the coefficient of variation from the dataset! StandardDeviation[Table[X[t] /. Xnnar[[i]] /. t -&gt; 100, {i, 1, 100}]]/ Mean[Table[X[t] /. Xnnar[[i]] /. t -&gt; 100, {i, 1, 100}]] Now, how to make this part of a plot where I can change the parameters ß, k or n in 3 different plots...I'm getting somewhere with this, which is amazing enough. Thank you so much for your help! Let me know if you ever need supplement advice or help with biology/mathematics because I'm actually very good at those
High dpi support on Windows.
Don't those trig functions need to start with capital letters?
&gt; Does the browser require flash player? No, in general, flash has been phased out on the web. In specific, there is no Mathematica-Flash support. &gt; Are CDFs any good? To my knowledge, no. To this dude, also no: [Post from last month](https://old.reddit.com/r/Mathematica/comments/b2uyve/web_mathematica_interactive_applications/?st=jvkhfily&amp;sh=8d048cbe) &gt; We want to put some data in the form of interactive graphics and make the users play with sliderbars and inout, and see the output change Try the 'cloud deployment' feature, I personally haven't used it much, but that looks like the best solution. Alternatively, if the graphics are simple enough, just throw somthing together in JS. I know that most people don't like the answer of 'How do I solve this problem with a hammer? Use a wrench.', but everything is just layers on JS.
Thanks for the reply. If we don't want to host it on cloud, what is the best solution?
Look at the reference pages for: [https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CloudDeploy.html](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CloudDeploy.html) and [https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/EmbedCode.html](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/EmbedCode.html) to see how to embed. I assume you already have the most of it programmed out in a notebook?
i tried using plot evaluate and still nothing
 sol={x1[t],x2[t],x3[t]}/.NDSolve[{x1'[t]== -5x1[t]+x2[t]+x3[t]+Cos[10t], x2'[t]==x1[t]-3x2[t]-x3[t]+Sin[5t], x3'[t]==x1[t]-x2[t]-4x3[t], x1[0]==0,x2[0]==1,x3[0]==0}, {x1[t],x2[t],x3[t]},{t,0,5}][[1]]; Plot[sol,{t,0,5},PlotRange-&gt;All]
Try using `NDSolveValue` instead. It's a bit easier to use here because it doesn't return a list of `Rule`s: sol = NDSolveValue[{ x1'[t] == -5 x1[t] + x2[t] + x3[t] + Cos[10 t], x2'[t] == x1[t] - 3 x2[t] - x3[t] + Sin[5 t], x3'[t] == x1[t] - x2[t] - 4 x3[t], x1[0] == 0, x2[0] == 1, x3[0] == 0 }, {x1[t], x2[t], x3[t]}, {t, 0, 5} ]; Plot[Evaluate[sol], {t, 0, 5}, PlotRange -&gt; All]
Yup. The blue font of \`cos\` and \`sin\` indicate that these are symbols without definition. Use \`Cos\` and \`Sin\` instead. All built-in functions start with capitals.
Just type `-&gt;` (for `Rule`) or `:&gt;` (for `RuleDelayed`) followed by a space. The notebook will automatically convert that for you.
Can you share \`mnistDecoder\` and \`mnistEncoder\`? Those are undefined symbols.
 mnistEncoder = NetEncoder[{"Image", {28, 28}, "ColorSpace" -&gt; "Grayscale"}] mnistDecoder = NetDecoder[{"Class", Range[0, 9]}] They themselves also don't give the nice pretty output they should either.
Simplify[]
I think you want `Apart[expression, x]`
I think thats exactly it, thanks!
For numerical calculations Mathematica has a function called \`FixedPoint\` for that. Nest, NestWhile,NestList,etc. however can also be used for a little bit more fine control. If you want to symbolically work with this, then often you can use that, if a \`y\` exists which satisfies an infinite function chaining with an associated starting \`x\` value, f(f(f(...(f(x))))=y, then you can also express that as the solution of f(y)=y. For Example f=sin =&gt; y=0 or f=cos =&gt; y=0.739085... (Dottie Number)
Has it something to do with the WorkingPrecision parameter?
No. [Mathematica will use whatever precision/accuracy you ask it to when working with `Real` numbers](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/NumericalPrecision.html). If you work with exact (symbolic) computations, you just have to live with the brute mathematical fact that some numbers have no elementary algebraic representation.
I assume what you are trying to type is f[x_] := 4 x^3 - 5 x^2 + x - 2 Plot[f[x], {x, -1, 2}]
Yeah, but What keys should be pressed to get " ，" ?
Press the comma key to get a comma. If you want both statements on the same line you should terminate the function definition with a semi-colon, like so f[x_] := 4 x^3 - 5 x^2 + x - 2; Plot[f[x], {x, -1, 2}] Separating statements with a comma produces a syntax error.
There's no reason for a comma to be there. Just start a new line
Thanks. Dude! It works. Here comes another problem. When I try to solve equation NSolve[(x^2 - x - 1)^(x + 2) - 1 == 0, x] **I just get {{x -&gt; -2.}, {x -&gt; -1.}, {x -&gt; 2.}}. But there is another solution here x=0 missed. The hints suggest I should use use Reduce for complete solution information.** Reduce[(x^2 - x - 1)^(x + 2) - 1 == 0, x] I got no response there. What's the problem here?
That floating/centered comma is the comma you get when typing with a Chinese keyboard. “，” (if this is the same one). This is unrelated, but you can find more information about it here: https://chinese.stackexchange.com/questions/13431/what-are-the-rules-for-using-commas-and-periods-in-chinese Note that when using Mathematica, the regular (western comma) is what you want to use. (I haven’t checked, but Chinese comma might also be supported in Mathematica, as an alternative to the western version)
My comma is this "," here is a pic of my keyboard. What should I press to get the right comma? https://i.imgur.com/k6HyIrw.jpg
To quickly get a response, restrict the domain used by Reduce. For example, Reduce[expr, x, Integers] or Reduce[expr, x, Reals] This will give x == -2 || x == -1 || x == 0 || x == 2 Without restricting the domain, Reduce performs a search for solutions over all possible complex values of *x*, and this is time consuming, at least it is on my machine. There are other, more sophisticated, ways of restricting the domain used by Reduce and these may be better suited to your use case. Check [the documentation](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Reduce.html) for examples.
I will tell you right now that this is not what you want to do. &amp;#x200B; You don't need the Chinese comma. Just use a semicolon (;) instead. &amp;#x200B; If you want this comma because you want to write Chinese, then this is how you do it: Assuming you are on Window 10, just download Chinese language packs, switch to Simplified Chinese (pinyin) and press the regular comma button on your keyboard.
So u are implying my keyboard is a Chinese version.
Can someone comment on what the difference is between Mathematica itself and the Wolfram Engine? I'm not sure I follow what exactly this means.
Likewise. Good question.
Mathematica is a desktop app and cloud platform that uses the Wolfram language. The engine is a software component that can be added to other projects to build specialized integrations or applications with the Wolfram Language without using Mathematica specifically (but it seems you still need an account associated with a free developer license). [An article about the engine ](https://venturebeat.com/2019/05/21/wolfram-gives-developers-free-access-to-its-knowledge-engine/) [FAQ](https://www.wolfram.com/engine/faq/)
could you elaborate on what you meant by "saws"? if you meant sales then yes. I get bombarded with discount offerings via email...they happen on special dates like Pi day or Wolfram anniversaries. This just launched today. Wolfram Cloud computing is an option if you don't want to get the software. It is free and might satisfy your requirements but I haven't played around with it too much to know the limitations (I have the software license). https://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/launching-today-free-wolfram-engine-for-developers/ A cheap alternative instead of getting the regular software is buying a Raspberry Pi. A stripped version of Mathematica is included in the standard distro for the RasPi. Good luck!
Cause I mean it's not on pirate Bay or anything *cough* *cough*
&gt; A stripped version of Mathematica is included in the standard distro for the RasPi. I don't think it's really stripped, in the sense of having less features. As far as I know, it's just slow because of the Raspberry (compared to fast Intel machines -- it's still pretty usable though.)
The Home and Hobby version is less expensive than the Colleges and Universities version, but it's still not cheap.
Probably not. I mean, look: In terms of software, Mathematica is one of the cheapest software licenses you can buy. In this business, scheduling apps are selling for like $2K a year. Mathematica is not asking for much when they sell for $200 a year. It's asking a lot to discount it even further, considering their software is actually pretty damn good. &amp;#x200B; If I were you, I'd look into school licenses. I remember my school had Mathematica for free, but you had to buy a license for $0 on their software portal. I guarantee it's heavily discounted or free. Heck maybe even ask your professors if they have a few laying around. Most math professors have licenses that they don't use. &amp;#x200B; If that doesn't work, ask around to see if someone will pay for a license for you in return for some amount of payment that goes to the app. Got an uncle that needs some accounting done for his business? Does the local coffee shop need some scheduling tool built for them? &amp;#x200B; The last option is to try some open-source languages. Julia is a pretty top contender to Mathematica, and it's free, but obviously it doesn't come packed with much. You'll have to do a lot of heavy lifting to get a solution out the door for a project you have in mind. This could be a good or bad thing. Mathematica comes packed with built in solutions for data analysis, image processing, knowledge, and deployment and if you build a solution yourself that requires these things, you have to manually piece them together.
Yeah, absolutely no arguments there on the inexpensiveness of Mathematica. I don't think my school licenses it, but I'll have to look at see. They license SAS so surely, they would be able to license Mathematica. Fortunately, Julia was already on my list of languages to learn for its data processing abilities; I hear it's a natural place to turn after you've reached R's limits in terms of size of datasets.
If you have to have Mathematica and you can't possibly justify even the discounted student or home and hobby price then it is never going to be the case that you are going to get the retail version on sale for 75% or 99% off, the best sale discounts have been at most 255 off the retail price. There have been some free exploratory, but limited, internet access portals provided by Wolfram, but those require additional understanding and very careful use to be able to operate the limited features provided, perhaps not appropriate for a new user to try to figure out on their own. If it could possibly be acceptable then there are lots of free alternatives, each with their own set of users, that you could explore https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_computer_algebra_systems
I'm a little confused too. If I already have Mathematica, is there any reason to use this?
If you want to use Mathematica in a way that is incompatible with your license you might. For example, if you want to use it in a cloud VM or something, but you only have a license for your workstation. If you have Mathematica v12, you already have everything this has and more, so from a software point of view, no, there’s no reason to install this as well. But it’s still cool that they are doing this. The new compiler and Python library make this a very interesting move.
Looks like no notebook interface, just the kernel.
Just use Wolfram cloud or whatever they call it now. It's free.
Actually, you just want to solve sin(x)=x, etc. Which is trivial in mathematica.
Everyone knows what Mathematica is. Trust me just ask and they likely already have it.
Programming is a very important skill for anyone entering the workforce, but the fact of the matter is to the average undergraduate math major isn’t going to be an expert in C, Java, Python, etc... As such if you want to get them programming, but don’t have time to teach them about compiling, etc... Mathematica is great because it’s all bundled together (they don’t have to figure out how to download anything difficult), the documentation is GREAT, really top tier, so they can teach themselves, and it’s heavily designed to be very user friendly. It has all the basic stuff like For loops everyone will know, but then 5,000 other functions built in as problems get more domain specific, etc... On top of all that it’s a great tool in your toolbox for any technical person who needs to quickly prototype and solve anything. I use it everyday and it makes me more efficient. You can also reach out to Wolfram and they can give you some ideas / a point of contact for perhaps someone who could come in and give your dept a presentation. Sorry the above is jumbled, on mobile, but let me know if you’ve got any questions.
Why the {a,b} ? Doesn't your answer also need to determine x1, x2, y1 and y2?
Solve\[x1\^2/a\^2 + y1\^2/b\^2 == 1 &amp;&amp; x2\^2/a\^2 + y2\^2/b\^2 == 1 &amp;&amp; (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) == -1 &amp;&amp; a\^2 - b\^2 == 3 &amp;&amp; (y1 + y2)/(x1 + x2) == 1/2, {a, b, x1, x2, y1, y2}\] This works, and gives quite a few answers
I just tried it and it gave answers that were dependent on eachother, so next I tried with Nsolve (numerical approximation) and it returns some imaginary numbers, so sure everything is correct?
Your first 2 equations are essentially the same ellipse. Which either makes your 3rd or 5th condition False. So there's no solution
Here is the original math problem: **Ellipse x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 = 1(a&gt;b&gt;0). A line passing through the right focus intersect with ellipse with 2 point AB. And P is the midpoint of AB. The slope of OP equals to 1/2. Figure out the ellipse from given info.**
Here is the original math problem: **Ellipse x^2 / a^2 + y^2 / b^2 = 1(a&gt;b&gt;0). A line passing through the right focus intersect with ellipse with 2 point AB. And P is the midpoint of AB. The slope of OP equals to 1/2. Figure out the ellipse from given info.** How do u gonna solve it if u don't assume A(x1, y1) , B(x2, y2) ?
Is point O the origin?
Yeap. How can u solve that Mathematica?
Hmm... no matter what I try, I can't seem to get an answer out.
The Wolfram Engine gives you a fully-functional kernel, but without a notebook interface. However, you can plug it into Jupyter: [https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/198839/how-to-add-front-end-to-the-free-wolfram-engine](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/198839/how-to-add-front-end-to-the-free-wolfram-engine) Be aware of the terms of use of the free license, though: [https://www.wolfram.com/engine/faq/](https://www.wolfram.com/engine/faq/) (especially the "Licensing and Terms" of Use section)
Your link doesn’t match your title
Yup, I copied the wrong post... My bad
where did the a^2 - b^2 == 3 come from?
They are essentially the same ellipse, but they are for a different set of points, {x1,y1} being the upper point and {x2,y2} being the lower point, or visa versa. This would make all conditions possibly valid.
I'm sorry but I really don't understand some parts of the question. Try at r/cheatatmathhomework
I forget the line x+y-√3=0
I forget to give the line equation.( x+y-√3=0). Sorry.
**I forget to give the line equation.( x+y-√3=0). Sorry for that.**
I forget to give the line equation.( x+y-√3=0). Sorry for that.
This is gold. No need to buy the license anymoree :)
Yes, it's really quite something. Especially for students and hobbyists. All of the functionality of the Mathematica kernel is available, which is a lot. However, as you noted, none of the normal notebook interface is present. Jupyter notebooks are essentially plain text interfaces sitting on top of a command line, so you have to work a little harder to make things look as nice as in a Mathematica notebook. Also:0 don't forget to read the terms of use for the Wolfram Engine.
This is for the line AB?
Yeap. Can u get that done?
I came up with 10 constraints relevant to this problem. P lies on the line y=x/2 yP == xP/2 P is the midpoint of AB xP == (xA+xB)/2 yP == (yA+yB)/2 Points A,B,P,F lie on the line x+y-sqrt(3) = 0. P is implicitly on the line from the previous constraint. The focus has point ( sqrt(a^2-b^2) , 0 ). sqrt(a^2-b^2) - sqrt(3) == 0 xA + yA - sqrt(3) == 0 xB + yB - sqrt(3) == 0 Points A and B are on the ellipse xA^2/a^2 + yA^2/b^2 == 1 xB^2/a^2 + yB^2/b^2 == 1 The line has a negative slope, so we'll let xA &lt; xB. Finally, a &gt; b &gt; 0 xA &lt; xB a &gt; b &gt; 0 Put all of these constraints into the Reduce function. Reduce[{yP == xP/2, xP == (xA+xB)/2, yP == (yA+yB)/2, sqrt(a^2-b^2) - sqrt(3) == 0, xA + yA - sqrt(3) == 0, xB + yB - sqrt(3) == 0, xA^2/a^2 + yA^2/b^2 == 1, xB^2/a^2 + yB^2/b^2 == 1, xA &lt; xB, a &gt; b &gt; 0}] That should give you the solution for **a** and **b**.
**Thank u very much.** **How to calculate the length of AB?** *Here is my code* xA == 0 &amp;&amp; xB == 4/Sqrt[3] &amp;&amp; yA == Sqrt[3] &amp;&amp; yB == -(1/Sqrt[3]); Sqrt[(xA - XB)^2 + (yA - yB)^2] What's the wrong with mine?
When you use the double equals "==", you are setting a left-hand-side equal to a right-hand-side that Mathematica can simplify to a boolean value (True or False) or use as a condition/constraint. You aren't actually defining any variables. Use single equals to define variables. Also, Mathematica is case sensitive. So if you have errant capital letters, Mathematica will interpret that as a different variable. xA = 0; xB = 4/Sqrt[3]; yA = Sqrt[3]; yB = -1/Sqrt[3]; Sqrt[ (xA - xB)^2 + (yA - yB)^2] I usually like to use vectors and Mathematica's functions to do computations where possible. A = {0 , 4/Sqrt[3]}; B = {Sqrt[3] , -1/Sqrt[3]}; EuclideanDistance[A,B]
No. I'm not. I'm implying the exact opposite. Why do you want to write “，” ? (This is what you'd need the Chinese layout for) Use "," and ";" for your code, and avoid “，”.
Thank u. Your methods worked.
Thank u for your hard work. I really appreciate your precious time on me.
‘PlotPoints’?
&gt; 1 comment It's an animation. Not sure why this happened. It should remain a circle when it is moving!
After running the exact same line of code in my Mathematica 12.0 setup: `Manipulate[ ContourPlot[x^2 + (y - a)^2 == 9, {x, -14, 14}, {y, -14, 14}, Axes -&gt; True], {a, -3, 3, 1}]` I got the same results when pressing the 'play' button. But when showing the plot step by step, I got the correct shape and position after waiting a bit for each step (\~1 sec). I think the kernel needs a processing time to show the correct shape. ^(Oh man, I hate wolfram)
The following works well for me: Manipulate[ContourPlot[ x^2 + (y - a)^2 == 9, {x, -14, 14}, {y, -14, 14}, Axes -&gt; True, PlotPoints -&gt; 15, MaxRecursion -&gt; 2], {{a, 0}, -3, 3}]
This works well for me: Manipulate[ContourPlot[ x^2 + (y - a)^2 == 9, {x, -14, 14}, {y, -14, 14}, Axes -&gt; True, PlotPoints -&gt; 15, MaxRecursion -&gt; 2], {{a, 0}, -3, 3}]
*Thank you. It works fine for me now. How can we add add numbers to the axes there like this codes below?* Manipulate[ Plot[a x^2 + b x + c, {x, -10, 10}, PlotRange -&gt; 10], {a, 1, 20, 1}, {b, 1, 20, 1}, {c, -10, 10, 1}]
Like others have said, it's how Manipulate renders the output - by default, it opts for speed over quality. By specifying PlotPoints/MaxRecursion, you're forcing a certain level of quality. &amp;#x200B; Is there a particular reason you're using ContourPlot? ContourPlot requires evaluating the full plot area, so it's naturally going to be slower than some others. For this example, it's entirely superfluous since there's no gradient to the data - if you use [Plot](https://i.imgur.com/d9tWbA8.png) or [ParametricPlot](https://i.imgur.com/cTUkTmT.png) (which are a lot more limited), it'll evaluate much more quickly and smoothly. &amp;#x200B; If you have other cases that (\*do\*) require something like Contour/Density/RegionPlot, you can make the render more smooth by reducing the plotrange that needs to be evaluated: [reduced](https://i.imgur.com/H1YnCnI.png), [minimized](https://i.imgur.com/Myjm76t.png). Still not perfectly circular, but a whole lot closer.
Have a look at https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/PerformanceGoal.html
I just tested this on a $20k high-performance computer, at it still required more than a second to replot correctly. It's scary to imagine what kind of spaghetti code is behind this behavior.
 sol=Reduce[x^2+y^3==z &amp;&amp; x+2 y==3 z+1 &amp;&amp; x y z != 0, {x,y,z}]; StringReplace[ToString[InputForm[sol[[1,1]]]],{"#1"-&gt;"1","&amp; , 1"-&gt;""}] returns the string without # "y == Root[1 - x + 3*x^2 - 2*1 + 3*1^3 ]" ToExpression will turn that string into an expression, but with an error message because Root is defined to have # and a root number. I think you want something other than what you asked for, but I do not know what that is.
 Eliminate[y==x+n &amp;&amp; x^2/6+y^2/3==1, y]/.left_==right_-&gt;left-right==0 returns 6 - 2*n^2 - 4*n*x - 3*x^2 == 0 because Mathematica sorts expressions by variable names
But how to in this form 3 *x^2+4*n*x+2*n^2-6==0？
 TraditionalForm[Eliminate[y==x+n &amp;&amp; x^2/6+y^2/3==1, y]/.left_==right_-&gt;right-left==0,ParameterVariables-&gt;{n}]
 TraditionalForm[Eliminate[y==x+n &amp;&amp; x^2/6+y^2/3==1, y]/.left_==right_-&gt;right-left==0,ParameterVariables-&gt;{n}]
You can use `ToRadicals` to expand the `Root` objects to full algebraic solutions, but these might be unwieldy. Your suggestion for turning `Root[1 - x + 3 x^2 - 2 #1 + 3 #1^3 &amp;, 1]` into `Root[1 - x + 3 x^2 - 2 *1 + 3 *1^3]` doesn't really make sense: you're not supposed to substitute the second argument of the `Root` into the slot of the first argument of the `Root` object. A `Root` object represents the n-th zero of the function in the first argument.
Thank u anyway. So you mean that I totally misunderstood this solution provided by Mathematica. Is that the case?
That's what it looks like to me, yes. Here's a simple example: function = (# - 1) (# - 5) &amp; root1 = Root[function, 1] (* 1; the first solution to the equation function[x] == 0 *) function[root1] (* 0 by definition *) root2 = Root[function, 2] (* 5; second solution *) function[root2] (* 0 again *) Because `function` is a simple 2nd degree polynomial, `Root` can immediately return its zeroes. For higher degree polynomials, `Root` will not reduce to a simpler form because it might be very complicated or not exist at all. But the principle is the same: function2 = #^3 - #1^2 + 3 # + 1 &amp; Root[function2, 1] (* stays a Root object *) Simplify[function2 @ Root[function2, 1]] (* 0 once more *) ToRadicals[Root[function2, 1]] (* Something complicated with cube roots *) Note that \`Root\` is meant to be used specifically with polynomials. You can't use it for something like `Root[Sin[#] &amp;, 1]`.
 function2 = #^3 - #1^2 + 3 # + 1 &amp; **What's difference between #1 and # ?** *I just can't see any difference difference.*
`#` is shorthand for `#1`; there is no difference between the two. In general, `#n` refers to the n-th argument of a function. For example: In[1]:= {#3, #, #4, #1}&amp;[1, 2, 3, 4] Out[1]= {3, 1, 4, 1}
 Integrate[x*y, {y, 0, 1}, {x, 0, y}] Integrate[Integrate[x*y, {x, 0, y}], {y, 0, 1}] Like table, integrate ranges may be in reverse order to what you'd intuit.
Post your code.
Functions of imaginary numbers can be real. I find trigonometric and logarithmic functions get bundled into complex expressions fairly often.
Mathematica can do strange (and sometimes incorrect) things for hard integrals. An example I encountered a few years ago is this: Consider the function f[x\_]:=(Cos[x]^2)^e, where e is some positive number. This function is real-valued and nonnegative for all values x. In particular, look at e=1: Plot[((Cos[x]^2)^e) /. {e -&gt; 1}, {x, -5, 5}] This function is well-behaved, nonnegative everywhere, and has a symbolic integral x/2 + 1/4*Sin[2*x], which Mathematica readily finds if we make the substitution: Integrate[Cos[x]^2^e /. {e -&gt; 1}, x] However, when we leave e as a constant, Mathematica still finds a symbolic integral --- some monstrosity with a _Hypergeometric2F1_: integral = Integrate[((Cos[x]^2)^e), x] Now if you plot this with the {e-&gt;1} substitution, it is quite clear that something has gone wrong -- this is not x/2 + 1/4*Sin[2*x]. Plot[integral/.{e-&gt;1},{x,-5,5}] What I think is happening here is that some incorrect and overly general integration rule was triggered. I can think of no other explanation than that this is a bug. Your issue may be similar. But we won't know until you post code.
Did you check whether the resulting expression evaluates to a real number? Just because an expression contains *i* doesn't mean that it evaluates to a complex number. Functions like *ExpToTrig* can help get rid of them.
&gt;some incorrect and overly general integration rule was triggered. I can think of no other explanation than that this is a bug. The "overly general integration rule" in these sorts of cases is that Mathematica treats all integrals and derivatives as if they are acting on complex functions, even if the user is thinking of them as purely real functions that can be handled with Riemann sums and one-directional limits. For example, someone taking calculus at the high-school level might tell you that the function Abs[x] has a simple piecewise derivative: the derivative is -1 for x&lt;0, and +1 for x&gt;0. But Mathematica won't give you this answer, because Abs[x] doesn't satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations and isn't complex-differentiable even at points on the real line. Similarly, an indefinite integral like `Integrate[Cos[x]^e, x]` is a complex function that is multivalued whenever e is not an integer. Mathematica is forced to give the answer in terms of a function like Hypergeometric2F1 that has predetermined branch cuts, and unfortunately those branch cuts pass through the real axis in cases like e=2. The "bug" is that Mathematica doesn't recognize that it can instead choose a particular, non-default set of branch cuts such that for certain values of e each branch will become continuous. Note that if you attempt a definite integral on this same function, Mathematica will know not to place the branch cuts across the real axis. You get the same result for Integrate[Cos[x]^e, {x, -Pi/2, Pi/2}] /. e -&gt; 2 and Integrate[Cos[x]^e /. e -&gt; 2, {x, -Pi/2, Pi/2}] even though you'd get the wrong answer with code like F[x_] = Integrate[Cos[x]^e, x] /. e -&gt; 2 // Simplify; F[Pi/2] - F[-Pi/2]
&gt; Mathematica is forced to give the answer in terms of a function like Hypergeometric2F1 Well no, Mathematica isn't forced to do anything --- it could just leave the expression unevaluated instead of applying a rule that isn't generally valid.
&gt;Mathematica isn't forced to do anything --- it could just leave the expression unevaluated While this is true, it's a strength of Mathematica's functional programming that such decisions can be made by the user. For instance, it's a deliberate design choice that users have both `Set` and `SetDelayed` available to them. So when you explicitly tell Mathematica to calculate the integral in the general case, and then apply the rule e-&gt;2, it's probably a good thing that the software doesn't automatically try to follow those steps in the opposite order.
One option is to use Replace Manipulate[ Plot[sols /. {a -&gt; a0}, {x, -3, 3}, PlotStyle -&gt; Red, AspectRatio -&gt; Automatic], {{a0, 3}, -3, 3, 1/10}]
You could also explicitly create a function of your parameters `a` and `x`, forcing evaluation with `Evaluate`. Scale is via `AspectRatio -&gt; Automatic`, whilst in this case the axes length is via a smaller plot range. With[{ sols = Function[{a, x}, Evaluate[ReplaceAll[Solve[x^2 + (y - a)^2 == 1, y]][y]]] }, Manipulate[ Plot[sols[a, x], {x, -1, 1}, PlotStyle -&gt; Red, AspectRatio -&gt; Automatic], {{a, 3}, -3, 3, 1/10}] ]
Mathematica's ability to do symbolic calculation is one if it's most powerful features, but it sometimes requires you to be a little more careful - you often need to "hold Mathemathica's hand" when switching from a symbolic form (e.g. your \*sols\* output, which is a statement that contains the symbols \*a\* and \*x\*) to a numerical one (e.g. plotting the sols output, which requires incorporating explicit values). &amp;#x200B; For instance, try sols2 = y /. Solve[x^2 + (y - 3)^2 == 1, y]; Plot[sols2, {x, -3, 3}, PlotStyle -&gt; Red, AspectRatio -&gt; Automatic] and you'll see that it works. So, this shows that it's nothing \*mathematically\* wrong with your output, but rather Mathematica not knowing how to handle your \*a\* in the way that you want. &amp;#x200B; A lot of these issues (and ones that you've had from prior posts) can be mitigated by using [SetDelayed](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SetDelayed.html) (:=) instead of just Set (=). When you use Set, you're forcing Mathematica to assign specific values (and behaviors); when you use SetDelayed, this doesn't happen until you specifically tell it to, and under conditions you specify. So, use SetDelayed with \*sols\* instead, and you create a function that's applied on demand: sols3[x_, a_] := y /. Solve[x^2 + (y - a)^2 == 1, y]; Manipulate[Plot[sols3[x, a], {x, -3, 3}, PlotStyle -&gt; Red, AspectRatio -&gt; Automatic], {{a, 3}, -3, 3, 0.1}] This now gives you the behavior that works, with the added benefit of being able to more reliably use \*sols3\* anywhere, without the same 'translation' issues. Plugging in `sols3[x,a]` outputs a symbolic form identical to your \*sols\* above (try `sols3[x,a]+4+4a` and see).
Have you tried plotting it? Seems like it doesn't have a nice closed form
 Do note that such a sols3 definition does not evaluate the Solve command until run time, which could be a limitation with more complex algebra. I[]:=Trace[sols3[x, a]][[2]] O[]:=y/. Solve[x^2+(y-a)^2==1,y]
Yes, I am able to plot the function. I think you are right, it probably doesn't have a closed form solution. I think I'll just have to give up on this. Thanks for your response.
The interpolating function of piecewise defined with one piece per data point, so the "closed form" would be pretty complicated. I don't know of a way to get those pieces out--I'm sure there's a way though. But what do you need those expressions for that the interpolating function object itself won't work for?
I'm planning on using it for an external program. It is the planet gravity function for a game I am working on. I wanted to try to make an exact function instead of just relying on the technique of adding getting the acceleration 60 times per second, and approximating a position with it. Because the acceleration changes based on position like this, I think you are right that it might be almost impossible to get the closed form solution out of it.
If doing the calculation in the external program isn't fast enough, maybe you could turn the interpolating function into an explicit table of data and export that? A lookup table is usually pretty fast (disclaimer: I have never done any game programming).
Ah, I see. So, it creates a table of data and then interpolates through that. That's good to know. That's an interesting idea, though I don't really think it would work in my case but thanks. I'll look into how and where that data is stored, thanks!
In astrodynamics a closed form of position vs time for an orbit is not solvable, in general. Your problem could reduce to that. What's wrong with numerically interpolating in your case?
That makes sense, a little sad though, thanks. In my case, I am using this in a multiplayer game, so the server, client and other clients connected need to be all running identical simulations. I think the best bet for me is to just have them all use a fixed time step (like, all run the physics at 30 frames per second, no better or worse). This should make them all have the exact same accuracy and simulate the same thing.
If you look at `FullForm[sol]` you can see all the data for the interpolating formulas.
Ooooh, thank you. I'll try that, thanks!
In short, yes. The aforementioned palette will tell you the keyboard entry for each element in mouse over. In general symbols are of the form `escape, shorthand, escape` and subscripts superscripts etc are control modifiers. Subscript is `ctrl+_`. If you generate sub contexts this way tab should cycle focus through them too.
A Google search for internals mathematica interpolatingfunction found this https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/59944/extracting-the-function-from-interpolatingfunction-object/59963 and other perhaps useful information
I would largely agree. Once you know the keyboard shortcuts, your typing speed will return
Thank you for your code! But you haven't solve the problem about the axes. I just wanna the axes to be static. And the x and y should be at the same length. Here is pic I want. https://imgur.com/f33e7a39-9a31-4037-b424-f81a042f5383
Thanks! But you haven't solve the problem about the axes. I just wanna the axes to be static. And the x and y should be at the same length and scale. Here is pic I want. What's more, I want each segment on X and Y axes represent 1. Can u do that? https://imgur.com/DmjgML2
Yes. Mathematica has an underlying text-based representation of everything, which you can use. For example subscripts are like this: `Subscript[x,2]` (this is also useful for programmatically creating subscripts). If you save your notebook, secretly it's just a text file, and you can look at it to see how Mathematica encodes your stuff.
Add `PlotRange-&gt;20{{-1,1},{-1,1}}` to the plot options.
The first time I tried this With[{sols = Function[{a, x}, Evaluate[ReplaceAll[Solve[x^2 + (y - a)^2 == 1, y]][y]]]}, Manipulate[ Plot[{sols[a, x], {x, -1, 1}, y == a x^2, y == a x}, PlotStyle -&gt; Green, PlotRange -&gt; 20 {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}, AspectRatio -&gt; Automatic], {{a, 3}, -3, 3, 1/10}]] The second time I tried this sols3[x_, a_] := y /. Solve[x^2 + (y - a)^2 == 1, y]; sols2[x_, a_] := y /. Solve[y == a x^2, y]; sols1[x_, a_] := y /. Solve[y == a x, y]; Manipulate[ Plot[sols3 {[x, a], {x, -3, 3}}, sols2 {[x, a], {x, -3, 3}}, sols1 {[x, a], {x, -3, 3}}, PlotRange -&gt; 10 {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}, PlotStyle -&gt; Red, AspectRatio -&gt; Automatic], {{a, 3}, -3, 3, 0.1}] How Can I plot 3 graph at one plane?
Thank you. I'll try this! I guess it will take some time to get used to it, but I think it will be worth it.
Thank you. But I think this works with input cells. I meant making mathematical expressions inside text cells. Or is there a way to "escape" text mode to write inline maths in text cells?
Fortunately these didn't take much time :). Your issue here are your brackets/braces. A couple things: 1. Parentheses () are for grouping/order of operations; Braces {} are for lists; Brackets \[\] are for functions. 2. **solsX** are functions that (by your definition) require two inputs, and these must be immediately followed by the associated arguments in brackets; ie it has to be in the form `sols3[x,a]`. As you have it, Mathematica gets stuck trying to apply the list `{[x,a],{x,-3,3}}` to them. 3. Plot needs to be in the form `Plot[function,bounds,opt1,opt2....]`. So, the first argument (i.e. the stuff that comes before the first comma) has to include everything you want to plot, and so it can be a list, as in `Plot[{fn1,fn2,...},bounds,opt1,opt2....]`. The functions shouldn't include the bounds like you have them here. So, your code should instead be in the form Manipulate[Plot[ {sols3[x,a],sols2[x,a],sols1[x,a]}, {x, -3, 3}, PlotRange -&gt; 20 {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}, PlotStyle -&gt; Red, AspectRatio -&gt; Automatic], {{a, 3}, -3, 3, 0.1}] When in doubt, Mathematica's pretty flexible in terms of how you can get things to work. In this case, you'd probably be able to get your plots to work if you do them one at a time, with your issue popping up when you're combining them. So, you can get the figure you want by plotting them individually, and combining them with Show: Manipulate[ Show[{ Plot[sols3[x, a], {x, -3, 3}, PlotRange -&gt; 20 {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}, PlotStyle -&gt; Red, AspectRatio -&gt; Automatic], Plot[sols2[x, a], {x, -3, 3}, PlotRange -&gt; 20 {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}, PlotStyle -&gt; Red, AspectRatio -&gt; Automatic], Plot[sols1[x, a], {x, -3, 3}, PlotRange -&gt; 20 {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}, PlotStyle -&gt; Red, AspectRatio -&gt; Automatic] }], {{a, 3}, -3, 3, 0.1}] Option 3: Once you get more familiar with working with functions, they can make your coding much cleaner. You can even define functions that are based on other functions; applied here: sols123[x_,a3_,a2_,a1_] := {sols3[x,a3], sols2[x,a2], sols1[x,a1]}; Manipulate[ Plot[sols123[x, a, a, a], {x, -3, 3}, PlotRange -&gt; 20 {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}, PlotStyle -&gt; Red, AspectRatio -&gt; Automatic], {{a, 3}, -3, 3, 0.1}] I've created the function **sols123** which is defined as the list of the other functions. Just as a demonstration, I've set it up so that each function can have different *a* values, to show how the initialization on the left side relate to the right. When I use it in the Manipulate I want them all to be the same, so I use the same value when calling it.
Hey /u/usuario1986, You can use Ctrl-9 to begin entering a formula within a text cell and use Ctrl-0 to end it. More information on mixing formulas and text can be found on the following documentation page: [https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/MixingTextAndFormulas.html](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/MixingTextAndFormulas.html)
Ah, no. Indeed this is for input cells. It seems that I misunderstood the question. I haven't really used to text cells much. However, as others said below, you can press ctrl-underscore (even without the shift modifier) and ctrl-hat (that is, ctrl-6) to switch to subscript/superscript mode. Presumably there are similar hotkeys for other things like fractions.
How can I plot 2 graph in just 1 plane? Here is my code . With[{sols1 = Function[{a, x}, Evaluate[ ReplaceAll[Solve[x^2/6 + (y - a)^2/3 == 1, y]][y]]]}, {sols2 = Function[{a, x}, Evaluate[ReplaceAll[Solve[x^2 + (y - a)^2 == 1, y]][y]]]}, Manipulate[ Plot[sols1[a, x], sols2[a, x], {x, -10, 10}, PlotStyle -&gt; Cyan, AspectRatio -&gt; Automatic, PlotRange -&gt; 10 {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}, PlotPoints -&gt; 10, MaxRecursion -&gt; 10], {{a, 3}, -3, 3, 1/10}]] What's wrong with my code?
After trying your code, the 3 options worked. However, the graph can't last long. Mathematica keep popping up a message. **Solve::ratnz: Solve was unable to solve the system with inexact coefficients. The answer was obtained by solving a corresponding exact system and numericizing the result.**
I hate to keep banging the same drum but please pre evaluate the functions! The speed up is now immediately 20 fold. I[]:= sols123[x_, a3_, a2_, a1_] := {sols3[x, a3], sols2[x, a2], sols1[x, a1]}; I[]:= Total[AbsoluteTiming[ Plot[sols123[x, #, #, #], {x, -3, 3}, PlotRange -&gt; 20 {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}, PlotStyle -&gt; Red, AspectRatio -&gt; Automatic]; ][[1]] &amp; /@ Range[-3, 3, 0.3]] O[]:= 22.5 I[]:= sols123[x_, a3_, a2_, a1_] := Evaluate[{sols3[x, a3], sols2[x, a2], sols1[x, a1]}]; I[]:= Total[AbsoluteTiming[ Plot[sols123[x, #, #, #], {x, -3, 3}, PlotRange -&gt; 20 {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}, PlotStyle -&gt; Red, AspectRatio -&gt; Automatic]; ][[1]] &amp; /@ Range[-3, 3, 0.3]] O[]:= 1.1 Further wrapping sols in this way degrades the internal ability to separate plots for styling. As for your specific error I cannot reproduce. Can you post your code again?
As u/ayitasarus has put, you need to wrap the functions you'd like to plot in the `Plot` function in curly brackets `{ }`. With[{ sols1 = Function[{a, x}, Evaluate[ReplaceAll[Solve[x^2/6 + (y - a)^2/3 == 1, y]][y]]], sols2 = Function[{a, x}, Evaluate[ReplaceAll[Solve[x^2 + (y - a)^2 == 1, y]][y]]] }, Manipulate[ Plot[{ sols1[a, x], sols2[a, x] }, {x, -3, 3}, PlotStyle -&gt; Red, AspectRatio -&gt; Automatic], {{a, 3}, -3, 3, 1/10}] ] &amp;#x200B; With[{ sols = Function[{a, x}, Evaluate[ReplaceAll[Solve[#, y]][y] &amp; /@ { x^2/6 + (y - a)^2/3 == 1, x^2 + (y - a)^2 == 1 }]] }, Manipulate[ Plot[sols[a, x], {x, -3, 3}, PlotStyle -&gt; Red, AspectRatio -&gt; Automatic, PlotRange -&gt; 20 {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}], {{a, 3}, -3, 3, 0.1} ] ]
Here it is sols3[x_, a_] := y /. Solve[x^2 + (y - a)^2 == 1, y]; sols2[x_, a_] := y /. Solve[y == a x^2, y]; sols1[x_, a_] := y /. Solve[y == a x, y]; Manipulate[ Show[{Plot[sols3[x, a], {x, -3, 3}, PlotRange -&gt; 10 {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}, PlotStyle -&gt; Brown, AspectRatio -&gt; Automatic], Plot[sols2[x, a], {x, -10, 10}, PlotRange -&gt; 10 {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}, PlotStyle -&gt; Magenta, AspectRatio -&gt; Automatic], Plot[sols1[x, a], {x, -10, 10}, PlotRange -&gt; 10 {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}, PlotStyle -&gt; Red, AspectRatio -&gt; Automatic]}], {{a, 3}, -3, 3, 0.1}]
In a blank notebook that code runs without errors.
 With[{ sols = Function[{a, x}, Evaluate[ReplaceAll[Solve[#, y]][y] &amp; /@ { x^2 + (y - a)^2 == 1, y == a x^2, y == a x }]] }, Manipulate[ Plot[Evaluate[sols[a, x]], {x, -3, 3}, PlotStyle -&gt; {Brown, Magenta, Red}, AspectRatio -&gt; Automatic, PlotRange -&gt; 10 {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}], {{a, 3}, -3, 3, 0.1} ] ]
Like u/GeEom said, it runs fine in a new notebook, so it's an issue with some previous definition hanging around interfering with things. So, you'll need to either use a new notebook, or Evaluation-&gt;Quit Kernal-&gt;Local, and rerun it. Trying that, and simplifying the steps of your code like in my first comment, should be your first steps when you're trying to troubleshoot things.
The three list-returning functions are 'Permutations', 'Tuples' and 'Subsets', the one you want is Subsets: &amp;#x200B; `Subsets[Range[1, 3], {2}]`
There's a lot of different functions that can handle equation solving, each of which works better in different cases. I don't do much equation solving, but it's my understanding that the algorithm used by Solve and NSolve isn't very well suited for nonlinear systems. I found [this thread](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/21484/how-to-solve-this-system-of-equations) \- it suggested FindInstance, which works for your system. Timing@FindInstance[{1 == a*x1a + b*x1b, 1 == a*x2, 1 == b*x3, 1 == x1a + x2, 1 == x3 + x1b, x1a*g1a == x1b*g1b, g1a == Exp[0.4*x2^2], g1b == Exp[0.8*x3^2]}, {a, b, x3, x2, x1a, x1b, g1a, g1b}, Reals] {17.0821, {{a -&gt; 1.59017, b -&gt; 1.40983, x3 -&gt; 0.709307, x2 -&gt; 0.628862, x1a -&gt; 0.371138, x1b -&gt; 0.290693, g1a -&gt; 1.17139, g1b -&gt; 1.49555}}}
Thank you. FindInstance worked, although after a while. Did it work fast for you? Some extra googling shows that effectively, NSolve is note recommended for non linear problems. I also found the FindRoot function, which solves numerically by taking initial values for the unkonwns, similar to Octave. This function also worked and solved fast. &amp;#x200B; I appreciate your help. Thanks!
Oh, sorry, I thought the "Timing" part was not part of the command, lol. Ok, so it does seem to take a while then, although it didn't need initial values. I guess I will stick to FindRoot if I have an idea of how much my unknowns should be, and FindInstance if I don't. Thanks again.
Yep, good initialization dramatically improves calculations. NSolve actually works for me if I restrict it to the real domain. FindRoot is quick, but be aware that it's much more limited - it looks around the values you give it, and returns the first solution it comes across. So, it won't show you multiple sets of solutions (if there are any), and it'll fail if your initializations aren't close enough (FindRoot fails for your set if I initialize everything to 25, for example).
In general, \`NSolve\` is primarily effective for polynomial equations. For more difficult equations, \`Reduce\` is usually the function you want to use.
It's definitely possible to slave a Kernel each to the front end and pool the remaining four. Potentially you could pool all six but I've never tried anything like that. &amp;#x200B; Working on parallel kernels entails a fair bit of scope management, knowing what is defined and stored in a given kernel. Mix and matching kernel use over two distinct users sounds particularly troublesome. If the use case is standard 'prototyping' style Mathematica, I'd divide the resources along a fixed line. If the use case is high volume computation, I'd manage the whole system via a queue and not offer any kernels for front ending.
What does this have to do with mathematca?
Do you have any exact examples?
Yes, but not sure how to post a long math expression here.

What is an input, i.e. FullSimplify[code] that returns differently in one version to the next? In any event, I'd recommend reaching out to [http://www.wolfram.com/support/contact/](http://www.wolfram.com/support/contact/), they can confirm a regression or not, and will probably be better suited to offer a workaround then I might be.
I've found over the revisions that the trajectory of Simplify functionality leads to faster and faster down the line execution. The presence of Gamma functions might be viewed as a symptom of this, as numeric results that would be calculated via Gamma functions under the hood are being stripped down further and further. &amp;#x200B; If you want to step through Simplify applications or restrict their functionality you can definitely go via TransformationFunctions options. &amp;#x200B; I'd ask what your aims are though. Seeking simple forms from the massively infinite space of expressions is a frequent Mathematica Hail Mary when people want to work with equations fundamentally simpler than what they need those equations to express. If you're reasonably assured that simple formulations exist, either bash them out manually using tools like Simplify to aid smaller logical steps, or come up with an expected form by inspection and validate it numerically.
Oh, yes the function call in this case is simply `FullSimplify[code,Assumptions-&gt;{...}]` With the above expressions
Your comment on execution speed is interesting. It's likely the case that that's why it's choosing to do that. &amp;#x200B; As for my aims, I just have lots of ugly integrals to calculate. Before simplifying the expressions are far too large to wrap my head around so I would like them to be more compact so I can think about interpretations, asymptotics, etc. &amp;#x200B; If the expressions were sub-several pages long, I could hash them out by hand or by several Simplify calls for sure. But considering that the old version reliably produces far smaller expressions, I've been a bit frustrated at the prospect. I don't want to spend extensive amounts of time manually simplifying an expression or emailing my buddy to have him simplify it for me on his computer, if I have a newer version of the same software...
r/lostredditors
Ciao, spero che Google translate funzioni bene dato che parlo solo inglese. Questo subreddit è per la suite software Wolfram Mathematica. r/mathematics è il subreddit di matematica generale, che è quello che presumo tu stia cercando. r/physics potrebbe anche essere un buon posto.
So polite! :)
Hi all, I'm certainly an amateur with Mathematica, and I am trying to solve an equation using the Solve function. For some reason, I am getting {} as my output. What am I doing wrong? Has Mathematica given up on me? Any help would be appreciated! Thanks again!
In general, the reason Solve gives {} as an output, is when there is no solution. Similarly, when there are infinity many solutions, the answer is {{}} If I typed it in correctly, the Cosine and Sine term's innards are the same, and if replaced by a constant q simplifies by and like this: q==(\[Pi]-2(ArcSin[1/2(2-Sqrt[2])]))/2; {1+l^2-2(1)(l)Cos[q],(l-Cos[q])^2+(Sin[q])^2}(*expand the n+cos squared*) {1+l^2-2(1)(l)Cos[q],l^2-2 l Cos[q]+Cos[q]^2+Sin[q]^2}(*reduce the times one and cos^2+sin^2 to 1*) {1+l^2-2l*Cos[q],l^2-2 l Cos[q]+1}(*rearrange*) {1+l^2-2 l Cos[q],1+l^2-2 l Cos[q]} Which are the same. Or if solved by Mathematica, like this: Solve[1+l^2-2(1)(l)Cos[q]==(l-Cos[q])^2+(Sin[q])^2,l] {{}}
Solve returns an empty list when there is no solution
Is this equivalent to an infinite number of solutions?
Did you read the documentation
No
It means there are no solutions. If this is a homework problem, it probably means you did your math wrong and need to look for errors
It means there is no solution - it’s not a glitch. If there is an infinite family of solutions, it will say that.
So this is slightly non trivial functionality, less 'out of the box' than a lot in Mathematica. You want a `LocatorPane` inside of a `DynamicModule`. Doing this in complicated scenarios can lead to some fiddly `Dynamic` interactions. There are examples in the `LocatorPane` help page, and broader guidance in `DynamicModule` help. Hopefully the following is an example close to what you're after: DynamicModule[{ dynamicLocatedPoints = {{2, 1}} }, LocatorPane[ Dynamic[dynamicLocatedPoints], Dynamic[With[{ x = dynamicLocatedPoints[[1, 1]], y = dynamicLocatedPoints[[1, 2]] }, Plot[{ y t/x, Sin[5 \[Pi]/2 t/x ] y t/x }, {t, -5, 5}, PlotRange -&gt; {-5, 5} ]]] ]]
I'll certainly give this a shot. Thanks for pointing me in the right direction!
{} the set of solution is simply empty. maybe something wrong in the input or the equation in general?
At face value you’re trying to solve what amounts to a quadratic equation (polynomial equation with one variable, and only of degree 2). I bet the reason you’re getting no solutions is because of the trig terms you have. Specifically the input to ArcSin and ArcCos might be out of the domain and so undefined. Additionally, in general there should be a nicer way of representing things like cos(2 - arccos(stuff)) so see if there’s a better way to represent those terms. For example cos(arcsin(x)) = sqrt(1-x^2 ).
The easy alternative is to use `Manipulate`, which gives you a slider for variables you want to dynamically change. But that’s not quite the same as what you want.
You want the TimeIntegration parameters of the Method option of NDSolve. There are examples in the NDSolve documentation under those headers.
Um... No? At the level where you're learning about Runge-Kutta, you should be able to program the necessary steps yourself for numerical solutions. You're either being extremely lazy or you're hired to do someone else's homework and you have no idea what you're doing. In both cases we are absolutely not going to solve this basic problem for you.
This isn't r/cheatatmathhomework . If you asked differently we might would've tried to help you
But, as someone who did the work below, there are infinitely many solutions. This does seem to be a bug in Mathematica 11.3, at least.
Learn by doing. If you've any experience programming or with an analytical project, like a physics investigation, port something you're familiar with into Mathematica. Where you are on the spectrum from 'I've never seen a computer before' to 'I use jupyter notebooks all the time' determines how alien you'll find Mathematica itself, but once you get started I find it's pretty intuitive. You can search for functionality in the help system, and the documentation and examples are extremely comprehensive. You can run code in the help pages, which guarantees you that you can re implement anything you see there; which ranges from basic to pretty advanced.
I haven’t had any experience with programming, though I am going to start a R course over the summer. Based on your advice, I will start doing projects on Mathematica. Thanks!
The Wolfram website has tutorials for getting started with the wolfram language used in Mathematica, so I'd start there.
[http://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction/2nd-ed/](http://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction/2nd-ed/)
 `In[1]:= Exp[-I*Pi]` `Out[1]= -1` `In[2]:= E^(I*Pi)` `Out[2]= -1` Like this?
I suspect the confusion is notation. `e` and `i` are lowercase letters, and thus variables waiting to be assigned in a new session. `E` and `I` are the mathematical constants you're after, or you can get the traditional forms via `esc e e esc` and `esc i i esc`.
Oh shoot your right! Sorry I’m new! Thanks a lot
In my experience, you only really learn something when you need to use it. I tried a few times in the past to learn Mathematica and LaTeX but just learned some simple commands and stared numb at a blank document. It was not until I found something that I could do on these platforms (like, some DAE that needed numerical solutions) that I started to really learn. So, I would recommend for you to first think about something that you need Mathematica for, then watch some basic tutorials and then google a lot for the more specific stuff. Practice makes it perfect.
For looping, `Do` [as per the documentation](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Do.html). Though note that looping is not very in vogue in Mathematica, most would sooner reach for functional analogues. &amp;#x200B; In terms of compilation, you can compile functions into C code via `Compile`, but this is pretty edge case stuff, and will not (generally) help you construct a deployed program, rather lowering overhead on some low level functionality.
If you prefer the nice typography mmta has, esc-e-e-esc and esc-i-i-esc give the lowercase constants.
You literally have a For loop in mathematica, but it's not commonly used. Mathematica isn't a programming language like C or java etc.
It looks like you have five equations with seven unknowns. Maybe try to discover another constraint in your problem domain.
I want to solve in terms of two variables.
You can simplify these quite a bit my hand pretty easily. Your last equation allows you to substitute for one of rb or rs, reducing the number of things you need to solve for immediately. This leaves your first equation particularly simple. St and Ct are a sine and a cosine from your second last equation, so a lot of the messier bits can be simplified a lot with various trig identities. Mathematica can help with a lot of this grunt work.
Thank you this is very helpful! Would you recommend using the reduce function with only two or three of the functions at a time?
This isn't going to do exactly what you are asking for, but it might show you a little bit how to use Mathematica and might show you something helpful about your problem. Notice that L/2*St-Ct/St(x3-L/2*Ct) appears twice in exactly the same form in your problem and most of those variables don't appear anywhere else essential in your problem. So let's call at expression q and try this eq={x3^2+q^2==(rb+rs)^2,(x3-1/2)^2+(q-y2)^2==4 rs^2}; sol=Eliminate[eq,q] Now let's try this modified problem. eq={1/4+y2^2==(rb+rs)^2,sol,rs==(Sqrt[2]-1)rb,rb&gt;0,rs&gt;0,x3&gt;0,y2&gt;0}; sol2=Reduce[eq,{y2,x3,rb,rs}] where I replaced two of your equations with sol and eliminated things that were no longer necessary. If you look at the result of that it tells you a great deal about your problem. It tells you the solutions depend on the value of y2 and that there are two separate ranges of values for y2. And it tells you explicit fairly simple equations giving you x3 and rb from the value of y2. You can then try Simplify[sol2,{rb&gt;0,rs&gt;0,x3&gt;0,y2&gt;0}] which makes the result considerably simpler, but while simpler it also pushes it away from showing how everything is explicitly dependent on the value of y2 because Simplify doesn't have psychic power to know what form I would imagine is simplest for my goal. I realize this doesn't give you an explicit solution for each of your four variables in terms of your two unknowns but since this simple manipulation, which I don't think involves any possible divisions by zero makes your system almost independent of your three unknowns L, St and Ct, I am tending to think the structure of your system isn't of a form that makes it easy to show how your four variables are dependent on your three unknowns. Perhaps you can take these last two results and use your information about all variables being positive and write out an expression of these that gives you some new insight about your problem. Can you possibly see from that whether it is going to be possible to express your entire solution in terms of L, St and Ct? Now to address related issues. You realize how very difficult your problem is, you type in a couple of lines, hit Enter, wait ten minutes and can't imagine why you haven't been given the exact answer in the exact form you want. I see people with this reaction almost every day. Imagine when you are done with this you have to write up a ten page report for management and the customer describing the project scope and plan. So you load up Microsoft Word, type a line, hit Enter, wait ten whole minutes and are frustrated and astonished that it hasn't created your finished report for you. How can this be? What is wrong with this software?!? Is there anything better than this? I want to be very clear, I am not being rude. I see people expect Mathematica to instantly solve problems and display the results in textbook quality and published form that they would never in their entire lives be able to do by hand. I suspect that computers and software have somehow led people to expect this. I sometimes joke that some users are waiting for version n of Mathematica which has a single button labeled "do what I mean" where you don't have to know any of the thousands of functions Mathematica has or how to use any of those to try to solve your problem and don't even have to type in your problem, you just tap "do what I mean" and the answer appears instantly in exactly the form you are expecting. I do not suggest that anyone just let a problem run for hours or even months if they aren't fairly certain about how long Mathematica might take to find a solution, but with that estimate I have let many problems run for hours or days and one for months while I patiently waited for it to find a solution I would never be able to find by hand.
This is an excellent reply, and I really appreciate the advice!
If I do this eq={x3^2+q^2==(rb+rs)^2,(x3-1/2)^2+(q-y2)^2==4 rs^2}; sol=Eliminate[eq,q]; s1=y2/.Solve[sol,y2] that instantly gives me four potential solutions for y2. If I then take those potential solutions one at a time and try eq={1/4+y2^2==(rb+rs)^2,y2==s1[[2]],rs==(Sqrt[2]-1)rb,rb&gt;0,rs&gt;0,x3&gt;0,y2&gt;0}; sol2=Reduce[eq,{y2,x3,rb,rs}] I find the first and third possible values for y2 result in False because the result is negative and you have asserted that y2 must be positive, but the second and fourth values result potential solutions for y2, x3, rb and rs. You might test each of those solutions if you can and see whether the solutions are valid or not. If they are valid then perhaps you can look at how all this information might help you express your problem in terms of the unknowns.
To quote [proximityfrank](https://www.reddit.com/user/proximityfrank/), This isn't [r/cheatatmathhomework](https://www.reddit.com/r/cheatatmathhomework/). The image you've given us clearly isn't in Mathematica, nor have you presented it as a question, nor is it even an equation! If you'd like some input on doing something with your collection of functions in Mathematica, I'd suggest you start by typing it up in a Mathematica notebook, and make some effort from there to transform it into whatever state you're looking for. If you get stuck, and you have a *specific task* you're stuck with, I'm certain we'd be happy to help.
So disclaimer, I have zero applied cryptography experience. The key you specify results (in Mathematica) in encrypted data byte lengths stepped in sixteens. Notably a zero length encryption results in 32 bytes, one through fifteen result 16 bytes, and as you've found, sixteen through thirty one result in 32 bytes. &amp;#x200B; With[{key = GenerateSymmetricKey[Method -&gt; &lt;| "Cipher" -&gt; "AES256", "InitializationVector" -&gt; ByteArray[ConstantArray[0, 16]], "BlockMode" -&gt; "CBC" |&gt;]}, ListLinePlot[ Length[Normal[ Normal[Encrypt[key, ByteArray[RandomInteger[{0, 255}, #]]]]]] &amp; /@ Range[0, 96]]]
Hey thanks for the reply! I don't need it anymore for my project (bachelor thesis), because I ended up using Python for it. But will check your code out
The first bullet in the documentation says: Coefficient picks only terms that contain the particular form specified. x^2 is not considered part of x^3. So, the issue is that, as considered by Coefficient, E\^i*T0(*σ+ω) does not equal (E\^i*T0*σ)(E\^i*T0*ω), as you're trying to use it; it considers 'i*T0(*σ+ω)' as a single unit. Obviously, just dividing gets you what you want in this case, but I assume your application's more complicated. Simplest way to get around this might be to just redefine it to can force mathematica to treat the terms separately. Set it up instead as: tt2=a\*E\^iT0ω. All calculations will be in terms of *a*, which we can replace as needed. tt2 = a*E^(I*T0*ω); Coefficient[tt2, E^(I*T0*ω)] Coefficient[tt2, E^(I*T0*ω)] /. (a -&gt; E^(I*T0*σ)) &gt;a &gt; &gt;E\^(I\*T0\*σ) This works even for more complicated cases: tt3 = (1+a+E^(I*T0*ω))^3; Collect[Expand@tt3, E^(I*T0*ω)] Coefficient[tt2, E^(I*T0*ω)] Coefficient[tt3, E^(I*T0*ω)] /. (a -&gt; E^(I*T0*σ)) &gt;1 + 3 a + 3 a\^2 + a\^3 + (3 + 6 a + 3 a\^2) E\^(I T0 ω) + (3 + 3 a) E\^(2 I T0 ω) + E\^(3 I T0 ω) &gt; &gt;3 + 6 a + 3 a\^2 &gt; &gt;3 + 6 E\^(I T0 σ) + 3 E\^(2 I T0 σ)
Points in a sphere can be picked according to the inequation (x-x0)^2 + (y-y0)^2 + (z-z0)^2 &lt;= r^2 where x0,y0,z0 are coordinates of center and r is the radius. In your data; x,y,z will be parts of the array. Like data[[x]][[y]][[z]]. So; getMean[x0_,y0_,z0_,r_]:=Mean[Table[ If[(x-x0)^2 + (y-y0)^2 + (z-z0)^2 &lt;= r^2 , data[[x]][[y]][[z]], Nothing], {x,0,256},{y,0,256},{z,0,256} ] ] should do. If what you mean by "datapoints are 2 units apart" is "data[[x]][[y]][[z]] is the value of the point (2x,2y,2z)" then you should double the x,y,z in the first part of the If function.
Ugh, underscores italized the variables in the function definition, but you got the idea 😅
I came up with a solution that I later realized was more complicated than was needed, but it still works and just makes it more generalizable. The basic idea is to define the 'neighborhood' that we're going to query for each point. allNbrs[rad_] := Flatten[Table[{i, j, k}, ##] &amp; @@ ({#, Range[-rad, rad]} &amp; /@ {i, j, k}), 2]; selNbrs[rad_] := Select[allNbrs[rad], (Norm[#] == rad &amp;&amp; AllTrue[#, EvenQ]) &amp;]; nbrsRad2 = selNbrs[2]; The first line generates a list of all possible coordinates where each x/y/z value runs from -radius to radius. The second downselects from this by mandating the length needs to equal the radius. So, using radius 2 generates: &gt;{{-2, 0, 0}, {0, -2, 0}, {0, 0, -2}, {0, 0, 2}, {0, 2, 0}, {2, 0, 0}} I originally read it as *within* a radius of two, so instead of the Norm==rad, it would be Norm&lt;=rad. Using this includes {0,0,0}. The real difference though is for larger radii, i.e. if you use rad=4, the first form (Norm==rad) would be the same as above but with 4's, whereas the second form would include smaller terms like {2,2,0}, etc. Lastly, the line getValues[data_, center_] := Extract[data, (center + #) &amp; /@ nbrsRad2] sets up a function where it will add each of the 'neighborhood terms' to the center position to give the coordinates within the data set, and uses Extract to pull out the values at those positions. This gives a list that you can use however, i.e Mean@getValues\[data,{x,y,z}\]
This is a guess, but you could try dividing tt by `E^ I T0 w`, running FullSimplify or Expand on the result, then use FreeQ to find expressions that don’t contain w in them.
Game developers solved this problem in various ways decades ago. You might want to check Gamasutra for how various types of worlds are implemented.

Ok so first off you are totally correct that the limit does not exist. I think the problem is in the way that Mathematica is interpreting what you wrote. Here is the documentation for Limit: https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Limit.html So what you typed in should be interpreted as lim_{x to 0}lim_{y to 0} f(x,y) which is 0.
that's great thank you!!
This just helped me too thank you
Probably not, but I wouldn't know since I (nor most of the people in this sub) don't know much about anisotropic star models. But considering you're writing this paper, you're perhaps familiar enough with the maths to write your own code. Alternately, you might be able to find a model written in Python, which you can call in Mathematica.
If you are looking for a good package for manipulating tensors (e.g. the metric), check out [xAct](http://www.xact.es/).
Thank You!
Makes sense. Thanks!
Absolutely agree, I am currently learning Mathematica. For certain math-centric problems it absolutely shines.
I think it's ok. Julia is a really nice go to for you if you want to do something that might hit production, but for small level analytics or statistics, it's really useful. I tend to just like the fact that it's not really a Programming Language, but an integrated environment. There's a lot of services like CloudDeploy that instantly connect to the web, which is a selling point as well for "fun" projects.
Hello I think you're confused about the subreddit you're in, since this is r/Mathematica, which is a subreddit about the software mathematica. You're probably looking for r/mathematics, but they dont like homework questions, so I think you would be better of at r/cheatatmathhomework
The pattern matching is great, homoiconicity is great, but the scoping is bad, and a stronger type system would be a welcome improvement.
I love Mathematica. It's an incredibly ergonomic language for it's problem domain. I have the great pleasure of being internet friends with several world class experts in the programming language aspect of Wolfram Language, and we all can go on for quite some time about its warts and shortcomings, not to even mention it's misuses. (As with every language, it's often shoehorned into use-cases it has no business in.) We all love the language, but there are a lot of parts that are bizarre or poorly designed or just plain wrong. Mathematica shares a spiritual heritage with OCaml. They both have lambda calculus semantics, have similar module systems, do pattern matching, etc. Mathematica is more heavily influenced by [LISP](https://xkcd.com/297/) back when LISP was still an acronym and companies sold "LISP machines" that ran LISP in hardware, particularly a company called [Symbolics](https://web.archive.org/web/19980423075112/http://stony-brook.scrc.symbolics.com/www/index.html)^1. Symbolics acquired the distribution rights to Macsyma, a LISP-based computer algebra system, in 1982, which had by that time already been licensed to over 50 universities. Can you guess what the very first university Macsyma was licensed to? CalTech, at exactly the time Stephen Wolfram was there doing his PhD. Stephen's work with Macsyma at CalTech influenced SMP which he started working on at CalTech and which eventually evolved into Mathematica. The connection between functional programming, term rewriting systems, formal logic systems, and automated reasoning really blossomed in the 70s and 80s, making Stephen's use of term rewriting computation paradigm instead of a functional programming language paradigm a really natural choice. With the exception of perhaps a Prolog-like logic programming paradigm—a very close sister to term rewriting systems—it would have been odd to use anything else for a general purpose CAS. Anyway, I digress. Based on what you're saying, I think you would really like Lisp (the modern non-acronym incarnation) which is more orthogonal, more "pure", in the sense that it has virtually no syntax. But it's far more general purpose than Mathematica and not even in the top 5 best tools to use to do what you are doing. I just mean you'd like it from the *language design* point of view. [1] Symbolics owned the oldest and first registered domain name in history, symbolics.com.
 Solve[{ x + y == 10^12, x/(10^12) + (10^12 - y - 1)/(10^12 - 1) == 1/2 }, {x, y}]
`Solve[ {eq1, eq2}, {x, y} ]` Check the documentation for Solve, it explains exactly how it can be used and how it is limited. In some cases you will also need to use `Assuming[...]` with Solve, to define what your variables are (Reals, Integers, etc) since Mathematica tries to solve the most general first.
Yes, i did check the documentation for Solve and came up with a solution, similar to what u/GeEom suggested. I made a few changes to the *equation* and here is my solution: `Timing[Solve[{x+y&gt;10^12 &amp;&amp; x&gt;0 &amp;&amp; y&gt;0 &amp;&amp; x/(x+y) * (x-1)/(x+y-1)==1/2},{x,y},Integers]//First]` &amp;#x200B; Thank you!
&gt; homoiconicity is great Why?
It means that Mma data structures can become code, and vice versa. There is more fine-grained control in some lisp-ier languages, but Mma has a good enough version of it that you can essentially produce code on the fly using other code (though you may need various Hold[]'s and ReleaseHold[]'s etc.).
What I'm seeing straight away is that `images` is blue, meaning that it is a variable that, as yet, has not been assigned in your session. If you look down the left hand side of your notebook, we can see that the top line where we should be storing an imported images in the `images` variable begins In\[-\]=, where subsequent lines display numbers showing the order of execution. If you select the very top line, and run it explicitly via `Shift + Enter` you should see all the uses of the variable turn from blue to black. You'll then need to rerun the downstream functions that depend on the value of images, namely `3, 8, and 10`.
Thanks for the reply. I ran each line after I wrote it. "fr" was successfully put as a variable but images was not. Even after I go back and run the line again it doesn't turn black. Is it that "ImageList" may not be a function that works with the video?
It's very strange to me to see an input line which both isn't assigned a history number, and has not returned an explicit error! You could try the following to check if the "ImageList" element is present: `Import["C:\\et_cetera\\file.mp4",{"QuickTime","Elements"}]`, you might also find that the "QuickTime" format specification is causing issues, and thus try `Import["C:\\et_cetera\\file.mp4","Elements"]`.
I think thats the case, because I don't run into that with .AVI; the .mp4 does not give ImageList in its Elements.
Maybe try using a file path without spaces? Not sure if that would help.
Look under scope [of the PlotLegends](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/PlotLegends.html) documentation. You'll see a LegendFunction and then Framed and Background options.
If you want very particular styling for your legends, you will probably just have to code up your own legend with more primitive functions like: [https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LineLegend.html](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LineLegend.html) to generate the inside of the legend; [https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Framed.html?q=Framed](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Framed.html?q=Framed) to add the frame (see also the \`RoundingRadius\` and \`Background\` options); and: [https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Epilog.html](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Epilog.html) [https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Inset.html](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Inset.html) to place the legend where you need want it.
In my experience, PlotLegends are pretty unintuitive compared to a lot of other things - rarely "simple"! You'll want to wrap your legends (inside Placed) with LineLegends; LegendFunction then allows you to tinker with the styling. Using: PlotLegends -&gt; Placed[ LineLegend[legendstuff, LegendFunction -&gt; (Framed[#, FrameMargins -&gt; 0, FrameStyle -&gt; Thick, Background -&gt; White, RoundingRadius -&gt; scalesize*0.5] &amp;) ], {Scaled[{1.00, 0.5}], {1.0, 1.1}}] should get you [what you're looking for](https://imgur.com/a/xi605MW).
^(Hi, I'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image) **https://i.imgur.com/HcJtonA.png** ^^[Source](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot) ^^| ^^[Why?](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot/blob/master/README.md) ^^| ^^[Creator](https://np.reddit.com/user/AUTplayed/) ^^| ^^[ignoreme](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&amp;subject=ignoreme&amp;message=ignoreme)^^| ^^[deletthis](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&amp;subject=delet%20this&amp;message=delet%20this%20eu5myjt)
Within your `Placed` legend specification, wrap your strings with a `LineLegend` or equivalent. There are examples in the `Plot` documentation, but I suspect the following would be a good basis: LineLegend[ {\[Nu]strings[[1]], \[Nu]strings[[2]] &lt;&gt; " - 20", \[Nu]strings[[3]] &lt;&gt; " - 40", \[Nu]strings[[4]] &lt;&gt; " - 60", \[Nu]strings[[5]] &lt;&gt; " - 80"}, LegendLabel -&gt; "label", LegendFunction -&gt; (Framed[#, RoundingRadius -&gt; 5, Background -&gt; White] &amp;), LegendMargins -&gt; 5 ]
Ctrl-2 will give you the sqrt symbol, and Crtl-6 will allow you to change the nth root part.
That syntax wouldn't work if you tried to execute it in Mathematica. It's indicating the first derivative of HypergeometricU with respect to the first variable. If you execute D\[HypergeometricU\[x,y,z\],x\], you'll see what I mean. A valid way to input this type of expression is Derivative\[1,0,0\]\[HypergeometricU\]\[1/2,3/2,t/2\] instead of using "\^(1,0,0)".
My advice would be to export your data to some files and then use something like gnuplot to obtain a publication ready figure. I have been waiting for years for Mathematica to change the ploting functions to allow decent export and I gave up in the end.
Thanks, you are right. Its the derivative. &amp;#x200B; The expression I gave was because of just copy-paste from Mathematica
&gt; It means that Mma data structures can become code, and vice versa. Homoiconicity means different things to different people. To me, s-exprs make Lisp homoiconic and `FullForm` makes Mathematica homoiconic. OCaml's macros offer rich syntax with no equivalent of s-exprs or `FullForm` but equally powerful rewriting so it is not homoiconic but loses nothing. &gt; There is more fine-grained control in some lisp-ier languages, but Mma has a good enough version of it that you can essentially produce code on the fly using other code (though you may need various Hold[]'s and ReleaseHold[]'s etc.). Sure but you don't need `FullForm` to achieve that.
I don't understand what `FullForm` has to do with anything. That just controls how expressions are printed, not how they are represented internally. The internal representation of an expression *is* in the form of the AST.
&gt; I don't understand what FullForm has to do with anything. That just controls how expressions are printed, not how they are represented internally. The internal representation of an expression is in the form of the AST. Ok. So even if Mathematica didn't have `FullForm` you would still consider it to be homoiconic? If so I think you would regard OCaml (and probably other languages) as homoiconic too.
&gt; Isn't that true of all languages? No, not every language has its own AST as a first class object. Code in asm/FORTRAN/C/Java/python/etc. has no introspection into how other code written in that same language is structured. I don't know much about OCaml so I won't comment on whether or not it is homoiconic
&gt; No, not every language has its own AST as a first class object. The problem here is what exactly constitutes a "first class object". In OCaml, for example, the compiler defines an abstract data type that represents code. When you quote code you get a value of that type. There isn't really anything "first-class" about that type: it is just another user-defined type. &gt; Code in asm/FORTRAN/C/Java/python/etc. has no introspection into how other code written in that same language is structured. Their compilers will have representations of code, of course. Do you mean the language has no facility to quote code and get at the result as data? &gt; I don't know much about OCaml so I won't comment on whether or not it is homoiconic FWIW, most people seem to regard OCaml has not homoiconic because it has only rich syntax whereas some regard Mathematica as homoiconic because it supports `FullForm` syntax which is s-expr-like.
I'd recommend using the `Derivative` function (or a ' after the name) to get the slope of the lines at the given points, and b==y-m*x to get a m*x+b form straight line. Since you have the minimums and maximums of a line, won't their slopes all be 0? Meaning their lines will all just be their x coordinate? If you have a list and need it's highest and lowest values, use `Min`, `Max`, or `MinMax`.
Use sort command and select the first element of the list. Say you have a list called 'list'. x = Sort[list, greatest] [[1,1]]. I probably messed up the syntaxes, but you should be ok using the documentation.
awesome, i'm trying this out now. &gt;Since you have the minimums and maximums of a line, won't their slopes all be 0? you're right, i should plot a point at the local max and min, not an entire line. i just want it to be obvious where those points are.
excellent! i'm going to give it a go right now
You can just use Max\[{x1,...,xn}\] to yield the largest element in the list, and Min for the least.
Can you mouse over the red box and give the error message? I don't have the documentation in front of me, but I don't think ParametricPlot3D needs to be inside Graphics3D.
"Graphics is not a Graphics3D primitive or Directive."
a = Cos\[\\\[Theta\]/2\] Cos\[\\\[CurlyPhi\]1 + ß\]; b = Sin\[\\\[Theta\]/2\] Sin\[\\\[CurlyPhi\]1 + ß\]; c = Cos\[\\\[Theta\]/2\] Sin\[\\\[CurlyPhi\]2 + ß\]; d = Sin\[\\\[Theta\]/2\] Cos\[\\\[CurlyPhi\]2 + ß\]; x = a/(1 - d); y = b/(1 - d); z = c/(1 - d); P = ( { {x, y, z} } ); P // MatrixForm Manipulate\[ Graphics3D\[ParametricPlot3D\[{x, y, z}, {ß, 0, 2 \\\[Pi\]}\]\], {\\\[Theta\], 0, \\\[Pi\]}, {\\\[CurlyPhi\]1, 0, 2 \\\[Pi\]}, {\\\[CurlyPhi\]2, 0, 2 \\\[Pi\]}\]
Manipulate only recognized explicitly visible variables. In your ParametricPlot3D none of your variables are explicitly visible. Try this (after restarting the kernel): P[\[Theta]_, \[Phi]1_, \[Phi]2_, \[Beta]_] := { (Cos[\[Theta]/2]*Cos[\[Beta] + \[Phi]1])/(1 - Cos[\[Beta] + \[Phi]2]*Sin[\[Theta]/2]), (Sin[\[Theta]/2]*Sin[\[Beta] + \[Phi]1])/(1 - Cos[\[Beta] + \[Phi]2]*Sin[\[Theta]/2]), (Cos[\[Theta]/2]*Sin[\[Beta] + \[Phi]2])/(1 - Cos[\[Beta] + \[Phi]2]*Sin[\[Theta]/2]) }; Manipulate[ ParametricPlot3D[ P[\[Theta], \[Phi]1, \[Phi]2, \[Beta]], {\[Beta], 0, 2 \[Pi]}], {\[Theta], 0, \[Pi]}, {\[Phi]1, 0, 2 \[Pi]}, {\[Phi]2, 0, 2 \[Pi]}]
ParametricPlot3D returns a Graphics object, so the error is indeed coming from the fact you put it inside Graphics3D. Get rid of Graphics3D - you just need Manipulate[ParametricPlot3D[...]...] If that still doesn’t work then try replacing {x,y,z} with Evaluate[{x,y,z}] to address the other comments “visible variables” point. BTW if you ever want to see a plot and a Graphics object in the same space, you can use Show[] to combine them.
Hey, thanks for the help and thanks for pasting that code. Some of my hopf coordinates were backwards, but it's fixed now. I can rotate the circles around. Also, if I place Phi1 inside the parametric plot, I can see the torus which the circles belong to.
Welcome! You should first check out (this page)[https://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction/2nd-ed/40-defining-your-own-functions.html] on defining your own functions. You should also check out the Palettes menu in the app - it offers easy ways to enter the notation you'll need to write a rational function. ``` f[x_] := (2 x^2 + 3 x)/(4 x^3 - x^2); ``` To solve a system of equations, the go-to function is (Solve\[\])[https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Solve.html]. To solve a linear system of equations check out (LinearSolve)[https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LinearSolve.html]. If you want to solve a system like `M x = b` yourself using row reduction, You can take `RowReduce[Join[M, b, 2]]` (where b is an `n*1` matrix) and look at `MatrixForm` of that, and then get a solution that way by looking at the output. I forget the nice way to analyze that so using solve like this would work: https://imgur.com/a/blwnvVT

this wasn't workin, and now i know why. when i solve for zeros, i was putting all the answers together into a variable, taking away the ability to grab each zero and refer to them as individual elements. here is what i came up with. f[x_] = x/(x^2 + 2); Solve[f'[x] == 0, x]; zeros = %[[All, 1, 2]]; zeros = Sort[zeros, Greater]; localmaximumx = Part[zeros, 1]; localmaximumy = f[Part[zeros, 1]]; localminimumx = Part[zeros, -1]; localminimumy = f[Part[zeros, -1]]; Plot[{{f[x], f''[x]}}, {x, -1, 4}, Epilog -&gt; {Green, PointSize@Large, Point[{localmaximumx, f[localmaximumx]}]}, PlotLegends -&gt; {"f(x)", "f''(x)", "local minimum"}] the last two issues i'm trying to solve are: 1. platting two points (local maximum and minimum) at the same time 2. adding those points to the plot legend thanks for all help, this stuff isn't so intuitive for a beginner!
