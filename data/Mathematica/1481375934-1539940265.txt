Cheers! I had previously tried that but the uncertainty values are very very low using that method, and my supervisor has asked me to redo them. 
Hmm... Have you plotted the model on top of the data with parameters evaluated at their ideal put/minus their uncertainties? This should give an indication of whether or not the uncertainties are actually too small relative to the spread of the data
Do you mean examine the residuals of the plots? If so, I've previously done that and worked with the RMS value, and it is very small again. I do think the method I've used is correct (posted on multiple forums and NonlinearModelFit has been the first answer) even though my supervisor isn't happy with it. 
Also, you say the RMS value of the residuals is very small. That means your data has little spread around the model, which in turn means that the parameter uncertainties will be small. I still like plotting to see it with my own eyes
Clock's ticking. 
hell yea it is
Take your licks and learn your lesson is all I can say. 
how are you doing calc 1, and a conference poster

what functions?
It's a graph. The axis generate but on the Mathematica 11 code the line doesn't generate whereas on the Mathematica 10 it does. Was wondering if there is a feature like in other languages that allow you to tell it to interpret as the previous version. 
I actually got it done in time
instead of plotting functions, try using Graphics3D. how about this: Graphics3D[{Sphere[], Cone[{{0.6, 0, 0}, {2.2, 0, 0}}, 0.8]}]
Others seem to be able to see the vector plot correctly, but I am not able to. Did something change in Mathematica 11 regarding VectorPlot3D?
Have you tried turning it on an off again?

Not off hand. I want it to work generally for any set. I use this a lot at work, so I need it to be robust.
I get {a-&gt;0,b-&gt;1} which is clearly wrong...
Try this one: FindFit[{{79, 100}, {684, 600}, {1322, 4000}}, a Exp[b x], {{a, 80}, {b, 0.003}}, x] You can find a good initial guess using manipulate: Manipulate[ Plot[a Exp[b x], {x, 0, 1322}, PlotRange -&gt; {{0, 1322}, {0, 4000}}, Epilog -&gt; {Red, PointSize[Medium], Point[{{79, 100}, {684, 600}, {1322, 4000}}]}] , {{a, 80}, 1, 100}, {{b, 0.003}, 0.0001, 0.01}]

&gt; I do have the underscores after each parameter in the original definition but, for some reason, they kept disappearing when I posted the question. Tip: start your code lines with 4 spaces and they will display as code. When you want it inline, just surround it with backticks. &gt; Do I need to define R[t], Theta[t] etc. beforehand, or is there a way to get Mathematica to simply differentiate and return time derivatives in the form R', Theta', etc? You don't need to define a symbol for Mathematica to do computations on it: if the first thing you write is `D[a[t]b[t],t]` Mathematica will happily return `a[t]b'[t]+b[t]a'[t]`. But other tip: try to avoid defining or working with variables starting with a capital as it can happen that they can be defined inside the language and have a meaning that you don't expect. &gt; As I mentioned, I get the answer when I differentiate the whole function, but am struggling to get a meaningful answer when I employ something like D[function name, t] It makes sense: you need to specify where you want to differentiate the function. `D[f[t, theta, alpha, psi, phi], t]` should work.
Awesome list! To add one, there is also right compose: F/*G@x==G[F[x]]
This page may be useful as well: http://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/Syntax.html A longer list exists on StackExchange I believe, but I can't find it with a quick Google search...
This should be the top response.
fantastic. thanks
The problem with the "get coordinates" tool is, that it doesn't latch to the curves. The manipulate function seems promising, thanks for showing me that.
How about this? f[x_] := Sin[x]; range = {x, 0, 4 Pi}; graph = Plot[f[x], Evaluate[range]]; point[x_] := Graphics[{PointSize[Large], Point[{x, f[x]}]}]; xtick[x_] := Graphics[Line[{Offset[{0, -20}, {x, 0}], Offset[{0, 20}, {x, 0}]}]]; ytick[x_] := Graphics[Line[{{0, f[x]}, Offset[{20, 0}, {0, f[x]}]}]]; myplot[x_] := Show[graph, point[x], xtick[x], ytick[x]]; Manipulate[Column[{myplot[x], x, f[x]}], Evaluate[range]] 
Yeah, that's getting close to what I want. What I am learning from all this, is that the only way to get this functionality is through programming, it's not part of the UI of Mathematica (or Wolfram Alpha for that matter)
Thank you for the answer !
Mathematica is a pretty broad programming platform (which I'm lumping in with the Wolfram language), so there is a huge amount that you can do with it that you could never do with Wolfram|Alpha. But if you'd mostly be using it to check integrals or derivatives, then W|A may be all you need for now ... especially since learning the syntax (even with recent versions' natural language support) is nontrivial. The software's documentation is excellent, though, so if you feel like learning it, the resources are there.
In short, Alpha evaluates single expressions, while Mathematica enables one to build large, user-defined "programs" and custom libraries. This is analogous to a calculator and a computer respectively.
lol
I recently bought the home version with the web interface, thinking I might use the web from work before, after, and during breaks. Then I downloaded a notebook for tensors hoping to try my hand at the rotation curve problem that caused everyone to think about dark matter. The notebook could not even display in the web version. Seeing that I instead bought the accademic version for work plus the web, and they throw in a home licence. Now I have a full blown mathematica at home and work, and I can tinker with symbolic expressions on line when I am bored. The web can't do what I need, but its a great learning tool. 
Someone delete this nonsense. 
Was hoping OP used Mathematica to sort and filter corespondents. 
The expression var /. rule does not alter the state of *var*. Instead, you should think of (/.) as a function that takes *var* and *rule*, and returns a new value (not stored in *var*) that expresses the replacement. Thus, in replaced = var /. rule the variable *replaced* now has the value from ratevector instead of lambda. *var* itself still contains lambdas. Of course, as in most programming languages, var = var /. rule evaluates the right-hand side first and then stores it in the left-hand side. In this case, the state of *var* is updated, simply because we're setting it equal to the returned value of (var /. rule).
Thank you again!
It would be much more useful if you showed us the part of your code that isn't working
Are you fucking kidding me right now?
I assume you are asking how to best use Mathematica to verify your results! First gather enough data to be statistically significant. You may need to commission the help of others (I see you've already started). Using Mathematica's wide variety of data visualization options, you can create some plots and graphs to display your results! Feel free to ask questions if you can't find what you are looking for in Mathematica's extensive documentation.
These spam bots need to have better targeted advertising in their programming. 
Not without seeing the function.
Given the evidence we have, we can only assume you made a silly mistake.

Very nice, but I am curious about the example given: D[a_*b__, x_] := D[a, x]*b + a*D[Times[b], x] Since Times has the attribute Flat, in Mathematica we would just write: D[a_*b_, x_] := D[a, x]*b + a*D[b, x] In the documentation I see that you take into account the attribute Orderless for pattern matching, but it doesn't say anything about Flat and OneIdentity.
Your first definition works fine on my system, although for readability, I'd recommend lifting out the reduction of the 't' argument (mod 2pi), using With[], as follows: f[t_] := With[{rt = Mod[t, 2 Pi, -Pi]}, (rt^2 - Pi^2)] I am unsure about what you write after the 'and thereafter stuff like' line. Could it just be that you forgot to capitalise Pi?
I tried to look up "sex" in mathematicas documentation, but I couldn't find anything. What is this?
you can also type `esc p esc` to be a super cool dude

Hey if they can post their nb or wl file showing us how they can fuck all these girls, then it's okay 
go fuck yourself
http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LUDecomposition.html There's a starting point
I found the problem. Having a 'Logitech Extreme 3D Pro' joystick plugged in will consistently cause a front-end crash for notebooks containing 3D plots.
I have an array of {x,y,z} datapoints where {x,y,z} are the columns. I can use ListDensityPlot[array] and it plots a 2d color contour no problem. I want to plot sections/slices of the data, so I've taken the array and exctracted the z values only zarray=Partition[ Flatten[ array[[All,3]] ] ,121 ] the flatten is uneccessary however I partition by 121 and get an array edit: well it seems somehow my syntax was off when I did the Partition and it created an invalid array for zarray, I just copy pasted partition from another file and suddenly it gave me a zarray with dimension . running Dimension[zarray] was giving me[1.] error, now it gives me the correct dimensions. syntax killing me somewheres
&gt;I'm guessing that you mean that you have a list of points? yes, it's a list of points, but typically import as an array[[]] instead of just a list, so there can be multiple data arrays for each array.. that's sort of beside the point, but yes it's a list of triplets, if you will. &gt;You can plot sections of the data by extracting points which fall into a particular region I know, I do this all the time, but syntax kicked my but today until I figured it out. Partition does exactly what I need it to for this application, the input file was a scan of x/y/z position with an x/y/z field vector at each point. the {x,y,z} triplet I was concerned with corresponds with x/y position and Bz vector component at the location I was concerned with (for this I don't care about BxBy at this time) the data file is written out in real time so everything comes down in a giant list, I have an x/y range and step in a header of the file, then a huge list of data. essentially once I get the list of triplets, for plotting slices of the data, I take out z with array[[All,3]]. which is then a huge column with dimension of xrange/xstep by yrange/ystep (literally 10x10mm in 0.1 step in both dimensions, so that would be 100 x 100 dataset or 10k data points, original array would be 10000 x 3 dimension). then I use partition on the single column Z to it goes from 10000x1 to a 100x100 dataset, at which point each row corresponds with a position etc. and my plots make sense. I wrote a program that works for this for my field scanner, and was writing a separate program to do the same for simulated output to match them 1:1. turns out my mistake was trying to grab data from my raw file again instead of my imported and processed file (without header) so it was somehow treating things as text instead of numbers when I got to this particular step in my notebook. I did get it all sorted though, basically in the middle of making this post this morning. 
What?
If I understand you correctly that you want to find the prime factors of an integer without the multiplicities, just use `FactorInteger[someInt][[All,1]]`. For further info, take a look at [the documentation page on manipulating lists by indices](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/ManipulatingListsByTheirIndices.html).
Thank you!, and what if i want to change the name of the function?, for example name it primeFactor and always use it as primeFactor[someInt]. Is this possible? 
This isn't /r/domyhomeworkforme, dude.
I guess you could probably use [Piecewise functions](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Piecewise.html).
Those light blue variables (\nu and T) are local function arguments. The dark blue variables (h, c and whatever is in the denominator of the global definition of \nu) are undefined. The dark blue variables were probably defined earlier in the Notebook but have yet to be evaluated (defined). If you can find where they are defined then evaluate (shift-enter) the cells that contain them. You can also right click on the cell bracket (that little thing on the right side of the Notebook) and check "Initialization Cell". This will ensure that the cell is evaluated once before you manually evaluate anything else.
Thanks for your help, I seem to have solved one problem. http://imgur.com/DZepqny I still don't get a good answer, is there something wrong in the way I have used the Sum function? To clarify n is a number between 1 and 6, and was one of the variables in each of the two original functions, but now I wanted to Sum for all values of n multiplying the two functions together, giving a function of the two other variables
You're welcome.
Awesome! Managed to get it to work with Piecewise functions after some trial-and-error. Thanks for your help!
 If[EvenQ@#, evenFunc, oddFunc]@# &amp; /@ {1, 2, 3} (* {oddFunc[1], evenFunc[2], oddFunc[3]} *)
Very nice! I've forever been intending to step into pattern testing and other 'left side' mma functionality.
You can solve this as a system of equations: Solve[{y^2 + x^2 == 16, x == -2}, {x,y}]
The first thing you tried just isn't the type of input expected by `Solve`. It takes `List`s of equations (or just one equation), not logical conjunctions of equations. The second thing you tried works because the substitution rules (`/.`) evaluates before the input is passed to `Solve`. What `Solve` sees is just Solve[y^2 + 4 == 16,y] which it can, of course, solve.
No I hadn't heard about that before, thanks for the suggestion. 
So it's `D[u[x], {x, 4}] + V*u[x] == lam^4*u[x]` ? I don't know anything about Jost solutions, but Mathematica seems to be able to find a general solution: DSolve[D[u[x], {x, 4}] + V*u[x] == lam^4 u[x], u[x], x]
Yes. However I really don't care too much about the 4 solutions (I know how they behave at least long time behavior), what I really want to know is how their Wronskian looks. 
lists don't have an element zero. Make the sum go from 1 to 10..
Just to clarify, are you trying to solve &gt; u''''[x] + V[x] u[x] - \\[Lambda]^( 4 u[x] ) == 0 or &gt; u''''[x] + V[x] u[x] - \\[Lambda]^( 4 ) u[x] == 0 
Why do you use DiracDelta[0]? I mean why have 0 as the argument, how does Mathematica view this? The solution given there does give me the four exponential solutions that I'm looking for. And I figure that I'll just define the solutions for the step function version piecewise, which is sufficient for my purposes. I only care about the Wronskian and wanted to see what it looks like for these simple cases to use as the starting place for the general V in L1 that I will adventually look at. So thank you.
You have a few options: - partition the data in a lot of smaller files; - convert the data to extract just the subset of information you're interested in, to a format that's easy to read; use another programming language to do that; - write your data extraction and processing algorithm in such a way that it can be applied in a 'streaming' fashion; i.e., does not require to hold all data in memory at the same time; - buy a bigger computer (you can buy systems with 256 GB nowadays for non-insane prices). There are really no programming languages that allow you to manipulate these amounts of data easily, and Mathematica most certainly hasn't been optimised for that use-case.
How can I go about splitting up the. Csv easily?? I guess open it and save it in sections? 
There's a few ways but I would recommend using a short Python or shell script to do the trick. Here's what I mean: Say your file, my_csv.txt, is way too large and you want to break it up into 100 smaller files. Let's assume you know how many lines of data are in this file (this is easy to figure out. If you don't know, try "wc -l my_csv.txt" in your bash terminal, or find out some other way). We'll call the number of lines "nlines". In Python, you'd want to write a script that opens my_csv.txt , reads off nlines/100 lines of data, and then writes those to a smaller file, and then repeats for the next nlines/100 lines onto another file etc. Now you have 100 smaller files that fit together to make your whole dataset! I'm on my phone so I won't write out any pseudo code, and I don't know how much experience you have outside mathematica so I'll stop my explanation here. I have some Python scripts that should do exactly what I've described, feel free to PM me if you want me to send them your way! Fortunately this process is very easy for .csv files since the format is simple. Might even be doable in Mathematica but I've never tried it 
You'd have to create a description of the vertices of a 3D model of the gear and then plot those, I think. Both algorithmic and static descriptions of such things exist in various formats. You'd have to obtain one and translate or find an existing translator.
1. Create gear in Blender. 2. Export to OBJ. 3. Import OBJ gear in Mathematica.
Yet another release adding bells and whistles and very little of substance. I'd be very very happy if they got back to the roots and put more emphasis on the symbolic math capabilities, rather than on all this flashy BS. 
- The double-bracket notation is for indexing into lists, no subscripts are needed. E.g., it should be `L[[k,k]]` with no subscripts. - (Even though Mathematica allows it, generally one should not use subscripts in code.) - Note that the fancy double-bracket character is just shorthand for two brackets: `[[`. You can type the fancy one with `ESC [[ ESC`. - In your posted code (http://imgur.com/TD46a8k), the matrix `A` is undefined. Presumably `A` is supposed to be the input argument, and `n` is the size of `A`. - There is a built-in function `CholeskyDecomposition` that you can compare your function with. - See this link for fixed code: http://imgur.com/a/Dm3hH
You can save the ratio as an upvalue of the symbol glycerolp: glycerolp /: glycerolp/glycerol = 770
I did some further digging and read that L[[k,k]] should be the format I should use although I haven't had a chance to try it yet so it's refreshing to know that is correct. Yes, I define A afterward. When I want to use doolittle's/cholesky's method for an nxn matrix I - first define A by, A = ["Insert nxn matrix"] - then I define the rows/columns, Cholesky[n] - then print them in matrix form, MatrixForm[L] MatrixForm[U] I was aware of the built in function but this is for a school project. Thanks, you've been very helpful.
You are welcome! Mathematica has a steep learning curve but it gets fun when you get the hang of it. I suggest asking mathematica.stackexchange.com your additional questions -- it's a much more responsive community than the Mathematica subreddit.
This isn't very constructive, could you explain which areas, or even point out which functions you would like to see wolfram research focus on?
Thanks a lot! This works well. Is there a way to then define `a` as a function of `x` so that I can work with `a[x_]`? Or should I just copy/paste and add `[x]`? Thanks again for the help 
This isn't really a subreddit for homework help, but you can evaluate indefinite integrals like those with commands like Integrate[1/(x^3-6x^2+11x-6),x]
Mathematica doesn't generally tell you *how* it solved a particular integral. For your purposes, it may not be Integrate that you need, so much as Apart[1/( x^3 - 6 x^2 + 11 x - 6)] .
Not on blank ones, just a typical code with some basic graphics, no animation or manipulate. 
Mind uploading the offending Notebook?

I downgraded back to Mathematica 10, the problem persists.
Very interesting. I wonder if it's related to your operating system? Could you be running out of memory? Or maybe it's related to your graphics card drivers. Just thinking out loud.
Works fine with M 11.1 on Linux. I can't try the whole notebook without your files though. Can you try maybe uploading the notebook to Wolfram Cloud and trying there?

I think there is a lot of value in reproducing equations from literature *exactly* as presented in literature (decorations and all.) It makes it a lot easier to spot mistakes, and more importantly, easier for other people to recognize what you've written. You'll note that the actual code for the decorations isn't much different from the naive table example; keep in mind that the whole "parsed box wrapper" family is hidden from the user and instead presented as a simple yellow entry box. The only real realization for more experienced people here is that you have to do the replacement on strings, but beginners are likely to try the other approaches I've mentioned, then get frustrated by the limitations I mentioned. Also note that this applies even if you choose a more "old school" notation, such as St[c][z] The second you choose that notation, you've ruled out the ability to do things like With[{St[c][z]=5}, St[c][z]] And so if you want to retain the ability to use your variables in With blocks, etc. you need to explicitly name each variable (e.g. StAI, StBI, StAII ...) and you'll need to generate them using even more hasselsome ToString and ToExpression functions.
Crashed MMA for me when I tried to scroll down, 11.0 student edition. Maybe someone could try removing all the dynamic content? I'm on Windows 10 as well, will check on my mac machine tomorrow. 
&gt; I think there is a lot of value in reproducing equations from literature exactly as presented in literature Sure, but Mathematica forces many more differences in how you write mathematics than just the presentation of exponents, subscripts, and the like. LaTeX is what one uses to set mathematics precisely.
Right. But this is advice for people who want to actually do math, not just present it.
If you have one big expensive function made entirely of library functions compatible with `Compile[]`, you can get a major performance boost. However, if you're using things incompatible with `Compile[]`, or if functions frequently call each other, the code will make calls back to the Mathematica kernel (appearing as `MainEvaluate` within the compiled code), greatly undermining performance.
I believe this is the situation I am in, I use some things that are incompatible with compile and in addition, functions frequently call each other. Thanks for the heads up as I was looking into using the recommended ccodegenerator, but it seems that it won't work for me this time.
You're welcome, but obviously part of my analysis is wrong as Mathematica DOES give you the option to predefine an array of a certain size, I would assume for the same reason Smalltalk does. Smalltalk was invented as a research tool back in the day. Alan Kay wanted to create a system that could do everything that Douglas Englebart had shown in ["the mother of all demos"](http://dougengelbart.org/events/1968-demo-highlights.html) and do it cheaply (the MOAD took some insane number of hours by an insane number of researchers to create). The result was the GUI libraries for Smalltalk, not to mention Smalltalk itself. By the way, Squeak was created by Alan Kay and the original Smalltalk team when they were working at Apple to be an open source version of Smalltalk that would extend the original system to provide modern multi-media capabilities. Go to http://www.squeak.org for the latest version. If you ever want to learn "real" object-oriented programming, that's the source (Kay invented the term to describe what Smalltalk did). Even today, new computer concepts and projects are often prototyped in Squeak.
I'll be interested to know if there is any money in this. I once wrote a commercial Mathematica Add-On only to discover that the market for such things is absolutely tiny. 
&gt; Mathematica is a great language for new programmers to learn how to code. I have quite a bit of experience with teaching beginners how to code, and I couldn't disagree more about this assessment. Mathematica syntax is difficult and arcane (especially when using the usual shorthands), and Mathematica syntax is simply too flexible - most mistakes give no indication of what goes wrong, other than that the expression entered doesn't evaluate to the intended result.
Agreed. Mathematica makes it very easy to do all sorts of useful things and that will certainly motivate new programmers. 
Ive been programming for over 17 years and know over 10 languages including Python Javascript C and variants, Perl, and more. Your opinion is misinformed.
&gt; Mathematica syntax is difficult and arcane You can just stick to m-exprs to begin with. &gt; most mistakes give no indication of what goes wrong That's possibly the biggest disadvantage, yes. However, the opposite would be a strong static type system but that in itself is something to learn. 
**Note:** this is about 1 month after the fact. Mathematica has a Wronskian function built in. Wronskian[D[u[x], {x, 4}] + V*u[x] == lam^4 u[x], u, x]

With a functional language like Mathematica, it is more ideal to use Sow/Reap, Table, or Map. AppendTo will be much slower than these techniques.

{x^2 , x-1, 1} is fine except in some cases for the 1. But thats not what you wrote earlier: {x^2 , x, x-1} Do you really need it explained how x and x-1 are not linearly independent?
The blank plot comes from the fact that b_i are not defined at all. Use instead an Evaluate with a replace rule using your solution "s" like this: Plot[Evaluate[{(Abs[b1[z]])^2, (Abs[b2[z]])^2, (Abs[b3[z]])^2} /. s], {z, 0, 20}, PlotLegends -&gt; {"(Abs[b1[z]])^2", "(Abs[b1[z]])^2", "(Abs[b1[z]])^2"}, PlotRange -&gt; All] With this, the plot should work as intended
FullSimplify
&gt; Chain rule would apply if I wanted to differentiate for x. df/dg = df/dx / dg/dx.
Could you clarify how `n` and `m` relate?
They are arbitrary multipliers. I'm using ListPlot to plot two vectors to form a lattice and these multipliers determine how large my lattice is. I want to manipulate the iterators as described above in order to change the shape my final plot forms.
There are multiple ways to do this, but one way is to split the upper and lower bounds and make them into two functions of `n`. Then the iterator of `Table` could be `Table[ (* your body here *), {n, -3, 3}, {m, lower[n], upper[n]}]`
Post the code that isn't doing what you want, indented by four spaces.
The way you wrote your code somehow causes Mathematica to interpret the argument of `Line` in Animate[Graphics[{Black, Line[{v[1, t], v[2, t]} /. sol]}], {t, 1, 10}] not as a function of `t` and therefore evaluates it first, which obviously goes wrong as it is not a list of coordinates (numbers). The simplest fix I could come up with is to define a helper function helper[t_] = Flatten[{v[1, t], v[2, t]} /. sol, 2]; (the `Flatten` fixes the nested lists so that `Line` can work with it) and then call Animate[Graphics[{Black, Line[helper[t]]}], {t, 1, 10}] Using `Disk` should work similarly.
What do you mean by "exact value solutions for this equation"? Do you want to know when `y=0`? If this is the case, the only real solution is `x = 2sqrt(2)-2`, that I got by canceling the numerator and verifying that this wasn't a root of the denominator as well.
Hey, sorry for not being clear enough. I'm not after the roots of the equation. I'm wanting to find the x value of a point on the curve given the y value of that point. I'm after a way of doing this for all points where 0 &lt; x &lt; 2*sqrt(2) - 2 For example, I want to know what the x value is at y = 0.5. But I need the x value in exact form, not as a numerical approximation. There are solutions in the R2 for the domain and range above (see link to plot below), I just don't know if there is a way to find these solutions in exact form, as they seem to require you to find the root of a 2 polynomials, and one of the polynomials is of degree 6. When wolframalpha or mathematica encounters a sextic equation it uses a numerical approximation to provide a solution. http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+y+%3D+((-x+%2B+2+sqrt(2)+-+1)+(-x%5E3+%2B+6+sqrt(2)+x%5E2+-+24+x+%2B+16+sqrt(2)+-+8))%2F((2+sqrt(2)+-+x)%5E3+sqrt(-(x+(x%5E3+%2B+(2+-+8+sqrt(2))+x%5E2+%2B+(41+-+12+sqrt(2))+x+-+36+sqrt(2)+%2B+32))%2F(x+-+2+sqrt(2))%5E2))
Yeah, I am not very optimistic neither. On your domain you can eliminate a couple of roots and reduce the function to `y=(x-2Sqrt[2]+2)(-x^2+x(2+4Sqrt[2])-12-4Sqrt[2])/((2Sqrt[2]-x)^2Sqrt[x(4Sqrt[2]-x)])`, but solving it for x still boils down to solving a polynomial equation of order 6, which is not doable in the general case.
From the documentation (*Details and Options*): &gt; Partial differential equations may also be specified using the differential operators `Grad` (‚àá), `Div` (‚àá.), `Laplacian` (‚àá¬≤), and `Curl` (‚àá√ó). Typically these operators are used as in Inactive[op] to keep the operator form from evaluating. Is that what you're looking for?
Hm where is that from? I didn't find it really. I just tried a little bit more right now. If I want to get a function r[t] which is a vector of two (or n) dimensions, can I use Grad[phi[r[t],r[t]] ? My problem is that I have to define the potential-function by by x,y,z,w etc. That means I fave to give Grad[] x,y,z values to differentiate with. But How does mathematica know, that r[t] is actually r[t] = {x[t],y[t]}? Or is there another method which let's me avoid defining x[t],y[t] completely? In this case I would just define the potential by some arbitrary variables. I am just unsure how to do this. I read so much help-files the last days, that everything is scrambled up in my head right now. It's really confusing ...
Could I see what you have so far?
Your code works for me, returning `{{x -&gt; 3/2, y -&gt; -(1/2)}}`. Make sure nothing is assigned to x and y. If it still doesn't work, try using locally-scoped variables: Module[{x, y}, Solve[{x + y == 1, x - y == 2}, {x, y}]]
Define "interesting"
I'm not sure I have a good def'n. How about we start with compact C^2 2d manifolds?
These are all fun: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization#Test_functions_for_single-objective_optimization
From [this MathWorld article](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HamiltonianCycle.html) it looks like you can specify different method options for `FindHamiltonianPath`. You would have to infer from their names what type of algorithm they are using "Backtrack", "Heuristic", "AngluinValiant", "Martello", and "MultiPath" 
Two common causes: https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/80978/187 https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/75284/121 It relates to the HistoryLength of the notebook and Suggestions bar. I only seem to experience that when I import large datasets, dealing with images or similar. Makes working with machine Learning a bit crap. Linux is typically a lot more bug free with regards to weird errors, but those two get everybody on every platform. It bugs me the most because I think the suggestion bar is one of the best things about mathematica. It makes the software so much more approachable for new users, and I often quickly click here or there to do something like easily rotate a picture, or plot a CDF or whatever it may be. Just saves me having to go to the documentation for a lot of stuff. 
It responds to focus strangely. You have to do a solid click before pasting, and you must be sure you copy and paste the format correctly. You'll get the hang of it eventually. On top. Of that, there is some UI funniness lately. Suggestions Bar and History Length are being blamed (as they have for ages). See https://www.reddit.com/r/Mathematica/comments/6is495/comment/dkc21t7 
Copy the code, enter a new cell, and make sure you past as Input. Then evaluate it. You've probably entered it as output form even in the input cell and that's why you get that. It usually prompts if you copy output to an input, and but weird stuff can happen. 
Post your code, indented by four spaces. it should look like this
I've edited the OP to include my code. But I'll post it here for conveniance as well: dataset = Import["data.dat", "Table"]; (*This line is supposed to import my data.*) ListDensityPlot[dataset, Frame -&gt; True, FrameLabel -&gt; {"p", "a"}, PlotRange -&gt; All, ColorFunction -&gt; "Rainbow"] (*And this line plots the data that I've imported.*)
Is your code in .csv or similar with headings? If yes, look at SemanticImport. Mathematica's built-in dataset functionality is pretty damn amazing. Can you post maybe the first ten lines of data.dat? It would allow me to see if something is funny. Also an image would be nice...
I'll give you a hint: the answer is somewhere between 2.4 and 2.6.
What do you mean by "solve" in this case?
In Norwegian education, this is 5.5.
Well you can enter the fraction exactly like that if you want, or you can just do the decimal representation. That said nobody uses 5¬Ω style representation because it's vague and can be seen as 5 * ¬Ω or 5 + ¬Ω.
I believe OP's first language is not English and mistook "mathematica" for "mathematics".
`D [x [t],t]` ?
There's nothing special about the kind of derivative you're describing; x(t) is just a normal function x : R -&gt; Q that parameterizes a path on configuration space Q. Especially since x is a function of a single variable, you can use the notation `x'[t]`. The prime denotes a partial derivative in the single-argument function that it follows (in this case, x). Is there something we're missing? What do you think "this specific type of derivative" is that isn't captured by Mathematica's standard derivative machinery?
Thanks, that's what I was looking for. I didn't realize that syntax was valid. Interesting aside, it turns out that NDSolve cannot solve the results of a Lagrangian when x[0] and x'[0] both = 0. But EulerEquation can.
It's special in the sense that x[t] is unknown. I was unaware of the syntax at the time to perform that operation on an unknown function.

Thanks!
Sorry, I've solved this after taking a walk. :) Sometimes, a dose of fresh air does the trick, huh? `Do[CopyFile[Echo[#[[i]] &lt;&gt; "\\audio.mp3"], paradiseLocation &lt;&gt; "\\" &lt;&gt; TextString[i] &lt;&gt; ".mp3"], {i, 1, Length[#]}] &amp;[ SortBy[FileNames["AU-*", Directory[]], (n \[Function] FromDigits[n, 16]) /@ StringCases[#, __ ~~ "AU-" ~~ hexid__ -&gt; hexid] &amp;]]`
The result of this will be interesting, please share: FactorInteger[2^2^12 + 1] Once that is done, the following will show the performance of your computer in relation to a bunch of reference systems: Needs["Benchmarking`"] BenchmarkReport[] 
Permanent[ FourierMatrix[ 25 ] ]
Its been 10 hours and its still going, however my CPU usage seems to be capped at 15%. So I seem to have more to learn about processors and hyperthreading. (if I'm using that term correctly) Thank you for the input. Hopefully I can figure out a way to run it faster. I'll post the results if I do. 
&gt;Its been 4 hours and its still going, however my CPU usage seems to be capped at 15%. So I seem to have more to learn about processors and hyperthreading. (if I'm using that term correctly) Thank you for the input. Hopefully I can figure out a way to run it faster. I'll post the results if I do. 
lol I posted it as kindof a joke. the Permanent function is in complexity class #P, not tractable by any computer.
Yeah the first one is a tough little calculation ‚Ä¶ Cracking it would be a publishable result. I'd abort it and just go for the "benchmarking" stuff, that should give you an idea on your system's performance for a number of interesting types of calculations.
That first one... I don't think that's doable. I might be wrong, but yeah, the factorisation of large numbers is massively difficult, and you just told him to factorise an odd number of length 1234 digits. The length of the number for all the atoms in the universe is a sad 81 in comparison if I'm not mistaken. I can't recall any techniques that would make that doable on even the most beefy of computers, heck not on even all the world's processing power combined. 
What computer do you have? Share your specs so we can give you feedback on where you'll be strong, weak, and it allows us to compare with ourselves. Also platform. Linux/Windows? Anyways, the builtin benchmark exists, but it's a little worthless since sufficiently powerful machines show less and less change despite huge leaps in performance. It's partially algorithms, partially how much stuff can be parallelized, but the biggest part of it is certain things like memory access etc. just take a fixed amount of time regardless of system. If you want to really push your system then look at synthetic benchmarks, they'll give the most accurate reflection of true machine power, though not real world performance. This is a really good benchmark in my mind. Simple, and related to the most fashionable thing around at the moment - neural nets. It's parallel and can use resources well. resource = ResourceObject["MNIST"]; trainingData = ResourceData[resource, "TrainingData"]; testData = ResourceData[resource, "TestData"]; lenet = NetChain[{ConvolutionLayer[20, 5], Ramp, PoolingLayer[2, 2], ConvolutionLayer[50, 5], Ramp, PoolingLayer[2, 2], FlattenLayer[], 500, Ramp, 10, SoftmaxLayer[]}, "Output" -&gt; NetDecoder[{"Class", Range[0,9]}],"Input" -&gt; NetEncoder[{"Image", {28, 28}, "Grayscale"}]] AbsoluteTiming[lenet = NetTrain[lenet, trainingData, ValidationSet -&gt; testData, MaxTrainingRounds -&gt; 3]] Then run it again with it changed to: lenet2 = NetChain[{ConvolutionLayer[20, 5], Ramp, PoolingLayer[2, 2], ConvolutionLayer[50, 5], Ramp, PoolingLayer[2, 2], FlattenLayer[], 500, Ramp, 10, SoftmaxLayer[]}, "Output" -&gt; NetDecoder[{"Class", Range[0,9]}],"Input" -&gt; NetEncoder[{"Image", {28, 28}, "Grayscale"}]] AbsoluteTiming[lenet2 = NetTrain[lenet2, trainingData, ValidationSet -&gt; testData, MaxTrainingRounds -&gt; 3, TargetDeice-&gt; "GPU"]] 
I have no idea how to read the result but here is a screen shot. and my build is at the bottom.

I know. It's a well-known problem what the factorization is. That was sort of a joke. 
No GPU?
PNY Nvidia Quadro p1000. Forgot that part. 
Ah okay. I was a little sleep deprived. Did not pick up on it being a joke. Feel stupid now. 
So that's a pretty beast score on the cpu side. Essentially the first number is the time it took to run in seconds and the second grid is a representation of the neural net. The cpu performance is pretty impressive, though the GPU performance is rather weak. Looks to be in the 1050 range. You should consider investing in a better gpu if you want to get into machine learning. The 1080TI is amazing value for money and will give you something you can do big models in. Yeah, that neural net won't really max out your cpu, but will stress it a bit. There are a bunch of reasons for that but it comes down to net design. I just like that example since it's pretty easy to use. In comparison, my i7 quad core laptop takes about 2600s for the first, and unknown for the second. I have a new threadripper build coming in the next two months which should give me the juice I need. I'm a bit sick of using the cloud. 
Hmm, this is difficult to look into. The Subscripts make it very hard to follow what is what (it's generally recommended to not use Subscript[,] objects as variables). I would also try and minimize the problem. Instead of providing us with the table, provide us with a single instance of the Solve call that demonstrates the issue, and perhaps we can identify the issue with just that information.
Typically complex solutions to such a problem indicate that the line is completely missing the circle. 
Without looking at your solution, I arrived at Flatten[Outer[List, {a, b}, {c, d, e}], 1] /. {x_, y_} :&gt; {x, y, x y} (I noticed we both liked using Flatten[Outer[List,...],1]) Perhaps this is useful. I think this is as good a solution as any.
Thank you! But I should have made clearer that the values are provided separately, and are not just the products of the indexes. I just gave them these names to help visualize what goes where.
Ah. I hope you can understand my misunderstanding :P
It might have changed, but last I checked there is no built in way to do this. &gt;I know I can use /.{y -&gt; r sin(theta), ....} things on it, but I would also like it to take care of the differentials as well. You should be able to just substitute the differentials in the same way, like in the [second answer on this post](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/59820/is-there-a-way-to-rewrite-integrals-in-mathematica-using-u-substitution). 
As mentioned on that forum, a package is the best way to do this. However, in a pinch you could use NotebookEvaluate["path/to/notebook.nb"] 
Thanks, but package as described in the documentation does not work here.
I was going to give an answer that used "TextRecognize" on your image, but it seems TextRecognize has a way to go before it can handle fractions.
So this is something the folks over at Wolfram should change. Subscripts are simply how things are written in much of science and engineering. Instead of having to manually type out a bunch of a1, a2, a3... variables, it is much easier to do Table[Subscript[a,i],{i,1,n}]. Consider also patterns like Subscript[a,i_] -&gt; f[i]
As a general rule, I try to avoid Do; it just never feels like idiomatic Mathematica. The simplest change would be for you to use MapIndexed, but I came up with this: Inner[CopyFile[Echo[#1], paradiseLocation &lt;&gt; "\\" &lt;&gt; ToString[#2] &lt;&gt; ".mp3"] &amp;, #1, #2, List] &amp; @@ {#, Ordering@StringCases[#, "AU-" ~~ hexid__ ~~ "\\audio.mp3" :&gt; FromDigits[hexid, 16]]} &amp;@ FileNames["AU-*\\audio.mp3", Directory[]] It assumes that the actual order of the copying doesn't matter, as long as they're numbered correctly.
I think yours is great and very idiomatic. I don't like using replacement rules for this sort of thing, but here we are: fromGrid[rows_, cols_, vals_] := Position[vals, #] &amp; /@ Flatten[vals] /. {{x_, y_}} :&gt; {rows[[x]], cols[[y]], vals[[x, y]]} Or without replacement rules: fromGrid[rows_, cols_, vals_] := {rows[[#1]], cols[[#2]], vals[[#1, #2]]} &amp; @@ First@Position[vals, #] &amp; /@ Flatten[vals]
The Mathematica license does not permit use on multiple machines. If you need to move a license from one machine to another, it's an easy process. They ask you to stipulate that you have erased the software from all other machines.
So basically I have to choose if I want to use it on my macbook or my PC? Jesus christ
If you want to adhere to the license, yes.
you sound like it was optional
It will depend on the type of license that you buy. When I bought a new one-copy license for my work computer last year, a second copy for home use was included with it. The 2nd copy has a hook that it expires after a year if you don't choose to buy the annual maintenance. But there is every possibility you might be able to get a "one person, two machines" deal, under certain circumstances.
Thank you. I guess that's not for me then.
Mathematica for all its awesomeness, has terrible licensing. It's expensive and insanely restrictive. The decent licenses typically include a home use license which is how you could do two machines... Seriously though, it's a wonderful research tool, but you cannot take it from research and use it in production. 
Post your code, indented by four spaces, or we cannot identify the problem.
Sounds like something you did caused a hang. That's not to say Mathematica won't hang inappropriately, but we'll need much more information to diagnose it.
I have the exact same impression. Mathematica works beautifully as long as you don't get do licensing. Thank you for that honest opinion. It's hard to get these reviews as a user, it seems. Most people will just be like "we had to put up with their conditions, and so must you. It's how it is. Mine is payed for with company funds."
Mathematica is either used by academics and students (so licensing is never something they ever experience) or companies like Intel or Finance houses where money is no question and they have unlimited site licenses or similar. For the rest of us? You're fucked! It drives me nuts because I would use Mathematica for everything if I could! Seriously, it drives me nuts protoyping something in Mathematica and then later converting to python/c++ is painful. It's not that it is difficult, it's just that Mathematica allows me to do incredible interactive and powerful stuff in a line or two using incredible documentation, having a consistent language and syntax and not having to bother with poor libraries etc. I don't expect them to go open source (although one can dream), but let me use more cores, more kernels, and more of the software. Oh well, they're only hurting themselves in the long run.
I second the requests for you to post code... Also, what OS?
That is the complete opposite of my experience. I would call it the most fairly-priced of any big software I have ever had to license. The personal and academic use licenses are very affordable, and it's still possible to buy a non-expiring license rather than be forced into an annual renewal. Yes, you can't take it from research and use it in production (without buying a production license). If you are using Mathematica to make money for yourself, you pass some of that money on to the makers. Compare that to, say, SAS, where you are paying thousands of dollars per seat whether you intend on commercial use or not, and have to renew every year, and have to pay an extra couple thousand for every add-on package you want... Even at full price it's a better deal than most other "business oriented" software licenses.
I wholly agree that the personal use, and academic licenses are amazing. Heck, they basically give it away to universities and stuff. The production licenses aren't affordable. Sure they are great compared to Matlab and SAS, but those examples are some of the absolute worst. Enterprise CDFs cost $1000 for 3 for a year. In production you're looking at $7000+ for Enterprise Mathematica, and let's not forget that you're handicapped unless you're willing to use their Cloud. The EPC? Let's just say that isn't available to anybody but the wealthiest of companies. I love Mathematica, I really do, but for even with increased dev time, in production, it doesn't make sense to use. It's totally inaccessible to smaller companies, and their cloud offering isn't compatible with most companies. They're getting better, but they aren't there. I do analytics, and I can set people up with a pretty cushy Watson Analytics dashboard for next to nothing. Is it as powerful? Not a chance, but they can afford it. For me to provide the same service with Mathematica/Wolfram products, I cannot do it in their price range. For the Intels and Zeiss Lenses of the world it is chump change, totally agree, but they need more accessible options.
That is fair. But I think you've been very lucky with your software vendors. I have seen some real pieces of cheese asking $5000 to $10000 a year. (And some high quality but very narrowly specialized products, where we paid the ~$10k asking price and got what we needed, but could have done the same thing much cheaper with Mathematica.)
Yeah totally get that. I once got work with some people using Catia... Now that is next level expensive. They were going at ~$28 000 /per user/ per year. And it's also so incredibly buggy and crash happy.
Can you specify exactly *what* is turning out weird with your plots? Maybe share the code that you tried but isn't giving the desired results?
This works only if `f[k-1]` and `f[k-2]` are already defined when you execute the command. Since you don't use scoping, the newly calculated value `f[k]` is written into global memory. This means you can work your way up by executing `f[3]`, then `f[4]` and so on up to the number you desire, but you can't immediately start there, since `f[k] = f[k-1] + f[k-2]]` really doesn't define a function in that sense within `Compile` (and AFAIK this also isn't possible because you can't use `SetDelayed (:=)` within `Compile`). So I doubt you can find a faster recursive way than to just use the standard implementation with memorization Fib[k_] := Fib[k] = If[k == 1 || k == 2, 1, Fib[k - 1] + Fib[k - 2]]
Thanks for explaining it like that. The compiling is part of the exercise, and after reading your explanation, the point being made through the exercise is that recursion and compiling are not compatible.
Thanks! What about this code makes it work as opposed to my approach?
Wow, yeah, FullForm shows me a lot of lists!! 
Just want to say that this approach works because the recursion occurs outside of `Compile`. I didn't mention this approach in my answer since it's horrendously slower and more inefficient than the 'standard implementation' because it can't take advantage of memorization. 
Any documentation on the nested exp memory leaks?
[removed]
Not sure if Wolfram documentation mentions this. You can test it yourself. Just apply Exp on some real number (I think this works with integers too) many times, like 5 or so.. You'll see what's the problem. I think if you do it in other language, like python, you'll still get an overflow, but not a memory crush
The dot product of a vector with itself should be the square of its length. Is that a unit vector?
First of all, that is not a unit vector so there is no reason to think that its dot product with itself would evaluate to 1. Second of all, the Hermitian inner product between two vectors is *not* the dot product because as you can see, you got a negative number there which is nonsense if you're looking for the squared length of a vector. You should take the complex conjugate of the second vector.
Oh wow, that's pretty bad. Memory use goes up to like 150 MB
The asterisk is infix for [`Times`](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Times.html), which is effectively element-wise multiplication. You want the [`Dot` product](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Dot.html) (replace the asterisk with a period), which generalizes to matrix multiplication. 
Thanks for the quick reply. I replaced the * with a period: MatrixForm[{{-(I/Sqrt[3])}, {1/Sqrt[3]}, {1/Sqrt[3]}}.{-(I/Sqrt[3]), 1/Sqrt[3], 1/Sqrt[3]}] I got an error message that the two "tensors have compatible shapes". 
Sorry, I saw the asterisk and didn't look closely enough at the rest of the expression. The first argument is two-[dimensional](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Dimensions.html) (3x1), but the second argument is one-dimensional (3), so we can't "contract" because the 1 and 3 don't match. Make the second argument a 1x3 by wrapping it in another list: {{a[1]}, {a[2]}, {a[3]}}.{{b[1], b[2], b[3]}} 
Thanks so much 
Sometimes it eats all the RAM, and OS just gets frozen, then you can only hard reboot it.
Since you want to perform many substitutions into your original equation, don't use permanent assignments like `x = 3`, but rather with temporary replacement rules like `x -&gt; 3`. I don't think you need the `Show` function at all. expr = (z == 2 x^2 - y^2); ContourPlot[Evaluate[expr /. z -&gt; 1], {x, -3, 3}, {y, -3, 3}] ContourPlot[Evaluate[expr /. x -&gt; 1], {y, -3, 3}, {z, -3, 3}]
Above and beyond you using element wise multiplication instead of Matrix Multiplication, don't type MatrixForm. It's unnecessary, clogs your code and is really only of relevance for output. Rather do the two arrays (lists of lists) and put //MatrixForm at the end of the input for pretty output.
I have to match the lower graph shown as closely as possible. I can use -(Cos[x] + Cos[y]) to get the colors matched up as well as the evenly space contour lines, but I'm having trouble getting he graph to "stretch" the way that is shown.
This is math mistake and not a Mathematica mistake - a trig function like cos will produce a circle and not an ellipse. The text above the problem gives some good tips for what find of function to look for.
That was one thing I figured out, but when I play around with transforming the ellipse function I just can't seem to get it right. The main issue is I can't "shrink" the middle section like it shows in the diagram given
Check out the docs for [Table](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Table.html) and [Do](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Do.html). They have a few examples. If you come up with a partial solution post it in this thread in code blocks or using Pastebin and we'll help you debug.
I think capital E will also work. 
DecimalForm is cool. It's probably very useful for formatting numbers with Print
It might be helpful to look at [Nest\[\]](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Nest.html) instead.
Thank you! I'll play with it and see what I can do. 
I doubt anyone here knows and if they did they likely wouldn't say a release date. However, if I had to guess, it'd probably be Mathematica 12 as this would be a very big deal. However, if its not ready it may have to wait for 13. I doubt it'd be on an intermediate release 
This would be a big deal for deployments in production environments, assuming there's no runtime license required; because that would be quite impossible to manage in dyanmically scaled environments.
seems reasonable 
Could you post the mathematica code that doesn't work?
Use the Gamma function: Gamma[k+1]=k!
I'll be honest, the Geo Plotting features of Mathematica are my favourite to play with. Mathematica is unmatched in this regard. I have done some insanely fun stuff with it. I really should share my code.
Huh? Not quite sure what you are asking... I think BooleanTable would be enough for you. If not, Mathematica will let you easily generate a truth table with table. Here is some simple logic, and go from there: p = True q = False p \[And] q p \[Or] q The funny logic things are inserted with &lt;Esc&gt; or &lt;Esc&gt;. Same for "and". 
Don't use a loop structure. That is slow, and not the correct approach. Use Table instead. 1. pop = Table[{x, 2500000000*E^(0.0166*x)}, {x, 0, 99}] ListPlot[pop] 2\. Again, this isn't the best way, but it will show you how to do 1. using a loop. pop2 = {} cpop = 2500000000 iter = 0 Do[cpop = cpop*E^(0.0166*RandomReal[{0.7, 1.3}]); AppendTo[pop2, {iter, cpop}]; iter++, 100] ListPlot[pop2]
Your Eq. (I) is just the (almost) most general form of an explicit autonomous 1st order ordinary differential equation. So all you have to figure out is how to get it into `DSolve`. solve1stOrderODE[f_, m_, x0_] := DSolve[{x'[t] == f[x[t], m], x[0] == x0}, x[t], t] should do the job, although you might need to consider using `NDSolve`, since there will not be an analytic solution for arbitrary f(x, m).
Yes it works, thank you so much!
Thank you so much for offering to help, it worked with the Gamma function! 
Does the second one work if you remove the pink comma?
Yes but it gives the incorrect answer (I verified by doing it manually and seeing someone else's solution posted online)
Post the code that doesn't work, or replicate the problem with code you don't care about, then post that code.
Sorry, I got an error saying the post didn't go through so thank you for letting me know the code example I showed didn't get posted.
You could try posting it on pastebin, if it's really long.
In making a simplified example the code seems to be functioning as it did before - nested tables: Table[Table[NDSolve[f(T,m)],T]m] are now giving me nested lists that can be sorted with the old code. When the code "wasn't working" I was getting the result of the nested table above in a matrix form that the list functions I wrote weren't acting properly on (duh). The biggest difference between my simple example and the actual code is the size of the numbers - the actual code will give me very small numbers, but shouldn't be anywhere near $MinMachineNumber. Talking with someone they suggested that it might be a memory problem? If that's it, I don't mind revising my code for matrices, but ultimately I'd like to have the nested table example always come out as lists or always come out as matrices so my code doesn't randomly stop working if my numbers go too small or too big. Any ideas? Thank you! 
You don't need to nest `Table`; it already contains functionality for creating multi-dimensional lists: Table[f[x, y], {x, 1, 3}, {y, 1, 3}] MatrixForm @ %
&gt; DecimalForm Agreed, now my manager can understand things.
For the first one, it might be because you don't have any operators between the Gamma calls. Mathematica doesn't assume multiplication like we do- you either need parenthesis () or an asterisks. For instance, Gamma[1+k]Gamma[1-k+n] should be Gamma[1+k]*Gamma[1-k+n] OR Gamma[1+k](Gamma[1-k+n]). Good practice is to just always explicitly state the operation. If this is the problem, what's happening is Mathematica is interpreting the entire function as 1 single symbol (a string), which can't be evaluated. For the second one, it's the correct solution, just has null in it. Usually this happens when there's a syntax error in the command. Get rid of the pink comma, and get rid of the extra enter key stroke- notice that in your other example, the execution stamp (where it says ln[35]:=) is on the same line as the command, but this isn't the case in your second example. Might not effect it, but it certainly isn't good practice. If neither of those changes solve it, try defining the function and then passing the function into the command instead. EDIT: Null can actually be directly related to extra whitespaces- see the [null documentation](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Null.html). 
Late to the party, but when I got the student license through my school wolfram screwed up and gave me 6 license keys (LOL). My point though- if you're a student then you might be able to ask around and see if someone else somehow has an extra key. Long shot, but it's either that or buying another key (at least, if you want to keep things legal).
Thank you so much! You're a great help :) 
Thanks for your response! I've been busy with this for two days now, finally getting the hang of it.. Fricking pitchfork bifurcation, man. Peace! 
Not a problem- but please specify what fixed the issue. It'll help others who run into similar issues! :)
Remove the Function function 
The trailing "&amp;" symbol together with the expression preceding it denotes a (pure in Mathematica's jargon) function. In your case, e.g. "MITCHELLS PLAIN"&amp; means a function returning "MITCHELLS PLAIN". As was suggested, remove `Function` call in `getIndex` definition.
Do you have the latest version installed (11.2.0)? The release notes of that particular version mentioned sound improvements in Linux. The error messages suggest some kind of ALSA configuration issue (ALSA is the sound playing framework in linux). Can you check if you can play sound using ALSA (eg. using the command line "aplay" tool, from the alsa-utils package)?
Thanks. This worked perfectly. I finally read up on how to define functions properly in Mathematica after years of use. I've always done it step by step (like procedurally or how I would do a math assignment in college) myself, but this code I have to share. It's a function of the Function declaration giving rise to a pure function, which has some really useful properties, but can also catch somebody out if they hadn't used it before. Turns out I can even drop the Evaluate[] after removing the function component. Thank you so much.
Yeah, I tried that, and it worked perfectly. I'd never bothered with functions and have only been a procedural step-by-step user before, but I had to share this code so I had to distil it a bit. Now I've read up on this peculiarity and understand it and its benefits.
Have you got pulseaudio on your system? What sound card? Check the Arch page on Mathematica. There used to be a great write up on sound issues there years ago.
I'll do that! Thank you. I didn't check Arch wiki yet!
Oh thank you! I will try that. I'll have to wait a little till I can check in to see what the version number is. I'll do that! Normally ALSA works - at least music and so on works normally.
Golden rule of Linux, when in doubt check the Arch wiki... The Ubuntu wiki isn't bad, but it's not as good as Arch's. 
Those improvements were pretty much just relating to CaptureAudio function, which allows Mathematica to capture audio from the PC mic.I just wish they'd get their ass in gear and fix CaptureImage.
I just tried on 11.2 on my Debian Linux system, I get essentially the same errors you get. It may be that Mathematica presumes a certain ALSA configuration, but I don't understand that well enough to be able to solve it.
:/ If I solve this I'll write it here..
The parenthesis you use in the call of the function f should be square not round. 
x_i times the second line is the third line. x_i times the third line is the fourth line. You could change your matrix to the identity matrix then it wouldn't be singular, there are many less drastic things you could do, I don't really understand the question.
[Singular value decomposition](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SingularValueDecomposition.html) might be of use to you.
Unfortunately, you can't. It is rather frustrating. You can, however, transfer your license from, say, Windows to Mac or vice versa. But you would have to request it.
You cannot plot a complex value like that. You need to map it to a real value.
The graph is blank because the formula inside the Plot function does not evaluate to an expression that could be plotted. When you encounter such situation try to evaluate only the expression inside Plot. When you do this to your example you will see the problem. I think you have a typo in your code. The correct expression is: Plot[(4/Pi) Sum[Sin[2 * Pi * n * x]/n, {n, 1, 100}], {x, -1/2, 1/2}]
I think that 'I' is a typo. If you change that to an asterisk or a space, the expression evaluates to a nice sawtooth function, which is probably what they wanted.
Depending on your license, you often get a second one free. Unfortunately Mathematica has quite tough licensing terms. No way around it. You can request a license transfer if you get a new device .
That requires a numerical matrix though...
Four spaces before code to format it properly. Secondly, avoid using spaces for multiplication. I know it looks good, but just don't. Secondly, you have a typo. Lastly, if that was indeed an I (i) which is an imaginary number then you need to split it into it's real and imaginary parts and plot them separately. 
Right you are, thanks for the correction!
I wonder if we'll soon see a full fledged native Mathematica running on iOS devices. That'd be a very big deal
I think that would not be a big deal at all. Such devices are inconvenient to use for work that require a lot of typing.
The last slashes looks weird. Have you tried other CSV files in other folder locations
Perhaps this will get a better reception in /r/matlab ?
Type in SemanticImport[' and then let it open up the little file browser thing. Then just browse to the file. Something about that path looks wrong. Also, put your datasets in your user directory. Depending on your system' 's config, you VN have permission issues. It's Windows so you can get away with murder, but mystery permission problems occur. Also, let SemanticImport try figure it out for itself sometimes. It's pretty damn good. I never feed it types anymore. 
Great... Just a few years late. I fucking love Mathematica, but they just make it so difficult to develop a product with. A year back we need to provide an analytics dashboard. Just couldn't make it worth with Wolfram. Webmathematica needs Java and flash in the browser and doesn't do live graphs. Cloud is slow as molasses and the licensing far too expensive. As a research tool it can't be beat, but I just can't use it in production. 
Do you have any specific examples of this? I've always found their forums at least decently useful...?
I report one case where the Mathematica doesn't conform to Wolfram-language spec. I call it a "documentation bug---14 lines of false documentation", which is true; mod edits my post to say "documentation typo". 14 lines of false documentation isn't a typo, the mod is liar: http://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1183662 Mod tells me to contact someone via email. I reply "that would be above my pay grade", and that is true, Wolfram isn't paying me enough to have me assist them like that. I am not their servant. Mod deletes "that would be above my pay grade". More recently, some pro-gun person makes a thread, but at least sticks to facts despite his obvious political opinion: http://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1200009 Anti-gun person replies "common sense would seem to say with more guns, you get more violence". Anti-gun person is parroting a progressive liberal slogan, and I dispute his assumption (which causally implies that the Founding Fathers lacked "common sense"). Mod censors my post but lets anti-gun post stand. Fine for a mod to disagree with me about politics, but incompetent for a math-mod to exercise political bias on a math forum---that isn't his job, it's an abuse of the trust placed in him by his employer. I reply something like "Wolfram pays a moderator to promote the view 'common sense would seem to say with more guns, you get more violence', but Wolfram isn't paying anyone to fix the bugs I've reported." Mod bans me. Some guys have really small wieners, and that mod is obviously one, but the forum would be better under a mod who doesn't act like it.
&gt; *As you wish, I'll make those comments about Wolfram on other forums instead.* So, you are trying to get even with the Wolfram mods by bitching on reddit? There are bugs and ambiguities and errors in all software and all documentation. Good luck finding another application as complex as Mathematica that doesn't have its own issues that are just as heinous. 
&gt; So, you are trying to get even with the Wolfram mods by bitching on reddit? You're projecting. I might as well ask whether you're kissing Wolfram's mod's butt in hopes of one day receiving a cookie and a gold star from Stephen Wolfram himself? &gt; There are bugs and ambiguities and errors in all software and all documentation. There are sycophantic fanbois who defend those bugs on forums, and sycophantic fanbois who defend incompetent moderation. &gt; Good luck finding another application as complex as Mathematica that doesn't have its own issues that are just as heinous. I don't need an application as complex as Mathematica, and no one does. I need an application that's reliable on the tasks I give it. I've written software more reliable than Mathematica, and if I ever do write software crippled by bugs, I'll market it to you, and you can tell its critics "all software has bugs".
Really? I don't want to discount your experience, but it's the exact opposite of the experience I've had. I feel they have probably the best documentation of any product I've ever used, and if you have a query (regardless of license) relating to a potential bug, they typically respond quickly... I've no experience with the forums though.
&gt; I've written software more reliable than Mathematica Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure you have. Complex too, I bet! BTW, I made a flying golden goat, but I'm not going to show it to you. I also can juggle refrigerators with my feet, but I don't feel like doing it for you now.
As if writing software more reliable than Mathematica is some amazing accomplishment? 'k
I don't discount your experience either, but here's mine: The documentation is big but not well organized. Organization is important, because there's too much documentation for anyone to sit down and read front to back. So someone on the forum tells me I should use the menu-item File-Install, and here's the documentation: http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/menuitem/Install.html That's very poor documentation. That menu item is probably documented somewhere else, but after clicking 5 links or so on a wild goose chase, I still hadn't found it. This documentation (14 lines of it) is false: http://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1183662 When I report the 14 lines of false documentation, some sycophantic Mathematica-fanboy calls me an "extremist"; the moderator tells me to re-report the documentation-bug to someone else; the moderator censors me for telling him I'm not getting paid enough by Wolfram to submit multiple reports; and moderator edits my words "documentation bug" to "typo"; I wouldn't call 14 lines of false documentation a "typo", yet the moderator puts those false words under my name as if I'd written them myself. If that response to a reported documentation-bug is the best you've ever seen, you're missing out on companies that care more to fix bugs reported to them. More false documentation: http://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1199360 Still more false documentation: http://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1197829 More false documentation: http://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1190875 Ambiguous documentation cost me hours of valuable time: http://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1199756 More ambiguous documentation: http://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1189490 More: http://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1177232 Inadequate documentation: http://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1176419

My guess is that mathematica doens't assume that a is an integer in the general case. Have you tried using "Assuming"?
In contradiction to Wolfram-Language specification, Mathematica assumes a is not a nonnegative integer. When engineers rely on buggy software, it can be disastrous. &gt; On February 25, 1991, a loss of significance in a MIM-104 Patriot missile battery prevented it from intercepting an incoming Scud missile in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, contributing to the death of 28 soldiers from the U.S. Army's 14th Quartermaster Detachment. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic I don't just need to solve that one problem. (If that's what I needed, I could just look up the answer in the book on my desk.) I need software that fulfills the promises made by its documentation.
I haven't heard of the "Wolfram-Language specification", what is that?
http://reference.wolfram.com/language/
Oh, Where does it say that it should assume a is nonnegative integer? I didn't know that was part of the spec.
I haven't suggested the Wolfram-Language specification requires Mathematica to assume that. You're recalling my words wrong.
You are a crazy person. Wow. Please get help.
Look how mad you are that I reported a bug in some software.
Please don't contact me again. I am not mad in the slightest. Please get help.
Says the person treating a computer program as a girlfriend.
&gt; I haven't suggested the Wolfram-Language specification requires Mathematica to assume that. &gt;In contradiction to the Wolfram-Language specification, Mathematica assumes a is not a nonnegative integer. 
You think Mathematica has to assume either * a-is-a-nonnegative-number, or * a-is-not-a-nonnegative number. You're error is believing Mathematica has to do one or the other, and your believing there's no 3rd option. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma In fact, Mathematica needn't assume either, and the Wolfram-Language specification forbids it from assuming either. 
**False dilemma** A false dilemma is a type of informal fallacy in which something is falsely claimed to be an "either/or" situation, when in fact there is at least one additional option. A false dilemma can arise intentionally, when a fallacy is used in an attempt to force a choice or outcome. The opposite of this fallacy is false compromise. The false dilemma fallacy can also arise simply by accidental omission of additional options rather than by deliberate deception. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Mathematica/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27
&gt; Hopefully no one is using Wolfram's ZTransform to design airplanes. Experienced users know not to rely solely on Mathematica for symbolic math results. It's a non-perfect tool, not a source of eternal truths.
So the false-advertising about it implementing the Wolfram-Language specification only fools inexperienced users.
Thank you for telling me what I think and for pointing out the errors in it. Thank you for your valuable life lessons about the necessity of confronting problems head on. If the spec forbids the kernel from assuming either case as above, what output would you expect from your input? ZTransform[DiscreteDelta[n-a],n,z,Assumptions-&gt;Element[a,Integers]&amp;&amp;a &gt;= 0] 
Yes. I think that is exactly correct.
The Wolfram Language is specified at an insufficient level of detail to call it a "specification". The functionality provided by high-level functions like *ZTransform* is only specified in very general terms. It does not allow two implementors to come up with independent implementations that are functionally equivalent after all the bugs are ironed out. Even if it were a proper specification, it is entirely possible for an implementation to follow aim to follow a specification and still be buggy. For example, several compilers exist that claim to implement the C++11 language, but none of these implementations are bug free. Mathematica has a variety of bugs, no proper specification, and no proper proper public bug-tracking facility. All true, *but it's still a useful tool* when used properly. You come across as if you take this single issue you found a bit too seriously -- as if Stephen Wolfram himself pissed in your tea or something. That's a bit weird. Chill out, use Mathematica, and verify its results before using them in a context where it matters. Thats all there is to it.
&gt; Even if it were a proper specification, it is entirely possible for an implementation to aim to follow a specification and still be buggy. For example, several compilers exist that claim to implement the C++11 language, but none of these implementations are bug free.

When I report bugs, they fix the bugs; they don't ban me for reporting bugs, and an army of sycophantic fanboys doesn't attack me personally for reporting the bugs. There's a big difference. &gt; Mathematica has a variety of bugs, no proper specification, and no proper proper public bug-tracking facility. All true, but it's still a useful tool when used properly. Where "properly" means using it like you personally want to use it, never mind the people who were fooled by the false-advertising into buying it for other purposes. &gt; You come across as if you take this single issue you found a bit too seriously -- as if Stephen Wolfram himself pissed in your tea or something.

&gt; You come across as if you're vying for a chance to give birth to Stephen Wolfram's children. That's all in your mind. As a matter of fact, I think Stephen Wolfram is a pompous ass.
&gt; and an army of sycophantic fanboys doesn't attack me personally for reporting the bugs. It's not the reporting of bugs, it's you're entire attitude to this _community_ of people who seem to be legitimately trying to help you. If all you wanted to do was be negative in the internet while denying all outside opinion or question, might I suggest a posting your thoughts to a blog instead?
You're trying to help me like Scientologists try to help people join their cult, you pretentious jerk-off. I am posting info helpful to people considering whether Mathemtatica is good for them to buy. If all you want to do is cry about true facts, why don't you "post on a blog instead"? It's not all about you sycophantic cheerleaders. You can start a cheerleader-subreddit for that, and state up front that the purpose is cheerleading and true facts unbecoming to Wolfram corporation are unwelcome. Until then, you don't have a community you're in a position to speak for. I'm not telling you to uninstall Mathematica is you like. Why do you get upset by true facts I post? Why don't you want prospective buyers to have access to true facts? Why don't you work on the areas of your life you need to work on until your self-esteem no longer depends on the reputation of some software program?
&gt; you pretentious [...] Truly, I cannot help myself. &gt; I am posting info helpful to people considering whether Mathemtatica is good for them to buy. I thought you were reporting a bug? I think what you're actually doing is loudly broadcasting your opinion and attacking anyone who is either asking for feedback or explaining to you why you're being met with criticism. I honestly don't know what you _expected_ here? &gt; Why do you get upset by true facts I post? Only one person seems upset here. 
&gt;Why don't you work on the areas of your life you need to work on until your self-esteem no longer depends on the reputation of some software program? Call me crazy, but the salt you claim to be experiencing from others might have something to do with these sorts of personal attacks.
Happy cake day. Hey, what issues have you had with using spaces for multiplication? I haven't had any that I can think of so I am curious about yours. Thanks.
Less readable, and the use of non-standard spaces breaks things (funny keyboards or copy-pasting code). Newer versions actually do a light grey \times (latex multiplication cross) which helps a lot, but when copying and pasting I've had some weirdness. Honestly, it hasn't been as much of an issue recently, but I've also entirely stopped using them. Maybe its a personal preference? It's also something lecturers used to say to avoid doing, my personal experience, and yeah. I guess they're technically fine. It's also just poor coding style to unnecessarily space, although using a space when appropriate is always a good thing.
Here is one way to evaluate the z-transform under the assumption that the symbol `a` is a non-negative integer: Assuming[{Element[a, Integers], a &gt;= 0}, ZTransform[DiscreteDelta[n - a], n, x]]
Now that you mention it, I remember a bug that was cause by this issue. If I wanted to input the number ten (10) and somehow input "1_0". Thanks for the response.

Calling people '*pretentious jerkoffs*', and then ending your post with '*your obsequious fawning is unrequited*', is priceless. Prime /r/iamverysmart material. Can't wait for your retort, you're quite a funny clown.
&gt; Wolfram would rather its users remain unaware of this bug. [citation needed] 
&gt; In contradiction to the Wolfram-Language specification [citation needed] 
&gt; Mathematica is making a stupid assumption about the variable a. Mathematica is stupidly assuming the variable a is not a nonnegative integer. First your saying it's inconsistent ("in contradiction to the spec"), then you say it's stupid, but you know as well as me that Mathematica always solves a problem generally if you do not assert additional assumptions. You're trying too hard to be /r/iamverysmart material. 
&gt; In fact, Mathematica needn't assume either It doesn't. 
It's great because this STEMlord doesn't even know what those words mean

One way immediately tell if someone has made an effort to produce readable and well structured code is indentation. In other languages you can expect most programmers to adhere to certain rules, even if they are informal and self-imposed, but there is a culture among many Mathematica programmers to cram the code in as few lines as possible resulting in an unreadable mess. This is not only true for novice Mathematica users; you can see it all over the official documentation. For an example of good indentation take a look at the Wolfram Blog entry [Computational Microscopy with the Wolfram Language](http://blog.wolfram.com/2017/09/29/computational-microscopy-with-the-wolfram-language/) posted a couple of weeks ago. Below the video "Dynamic Image Viewing using DynamicImage", you will find a piece of code that starts with DynamicModule. In a single glance you can tell that it consists of an event handler with a DynamicImage, two events ("MouseDown" and "MouseDragged") and the property PassEventsDown. Compare this with the code in the documentation for [DynamicModule]( http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/DynamicModule.html) under "Neat Examples". Even though it is quite shorter, it is harder to discern its structure. 
Great, I think this is something I can improve on! 
Are there any official style guides for Mathematica code?
Check out this StackExchange [thread] (https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/18/where-can-i-find-examples-of-good-mathematica-programming-practice).

Thank you it worked!

Not sure I know what you are asking, but maybe this is it? /. &lt;lambda&gt; -&gt; &lt;value&gt;
The period makes it a float, and it only works on literals. Add *//N* at the end of the statement to get an approximate value.
Mathematica defaults to natural log. Do "Log[Na]" i.e. remove the period after the variable name. A period after the number (500.) turns it into a numeric calculation as opposed to an exact answer without the period (500)
Thanks, worked for me.
I have this matrix that‚Äôs 2x30, and I want to take the second column, square it and add the resulting vector to the matrix. I could extract the column and square it, but I‚Äôm having problems to join them.
 "AppendTo" can solve your problem:)
[please learn what this key does](http://cmeimg-a.akamaihd.net/640/ieh/a04/hs/3e/use-print-screen-button-800x800.jpg) also yes use AppendTo. or if you want to use Join, replace B with {B} in Transpose
Look at Table[] That should let you do exactly what you're asking for, and do so really easily. 
I know what it does, but internet wasn‚Äôt working really good so I posted it from my iPad. Thanks! What difference does it make?
AppendTo will actually modify the variable, Join or Append will just construct the object without saving it to a variable
you can use `Dt[x Sin[y] - y Sin[x], x]` to compute the derivative. you'll get some expression involving `Dt[y, x]` = dy/dx which you can then solve for
I understand this is how to get the derivative of the function. After finding this, how would I go about finding the slope at x=1? 
You substitute x = 1 in... Dude, that basic math. So you'd do something like: /. x -&gt; 1
Like I said, I am currently in a class learning Mathematica and needed some help. I understand how to do it outside of the program. 
Then my suggestion above does the substitution in for x for you. Just reference the output of D[], and then append the " /. x-&gt; 1 " onto the end. e.g. %14 /. x -&gt; 1
Thank you for the help 
Can you explain what you mean by "crashing"? I've entered it in 11.2.0.0 and the kernel takes it sweet time on evaluation with no end in sight, but that can happen when Mathematica goes to work on a complicated expression.
That's what happened to me once after I posted this (I gave up after a few minutes). But before I posted, I had a repeatable situation where I started Mathematica from scratch, entered that input, and within a minute Mathematica beeped, and when I asked it why the beep (under the Help menu), it said the Kernel had quit. That's the crash I meant, and it happened on repeated trials.
That's odd. I could imagine that rewriting this expression can leed to some very big expressions, it may simply be that the kernel runs out of memory. But even that shouldn't lead to a kernel crash.
They're probably all very similar basic algorithms under the hood. Call a library or write it yourself from scratch. The only practical issue is performance in which case you want to write your function to be minimized in a fast language i.e. not Mathematica, Julia or Matlab. 
They are all very similar, the implementation in Mathematica is very robust and well-tested. If you want guarantees about convergence you need to understand the underlying algorithm you're using, which is true regardless of what you're using. FindMinimum isn't some unique special sauce algorithm, it's a collection of several well-known numerical algorithms. If you want strong guarantees then you need to understand the underlying algorithms and manually select the options appropriate for your problem. The same is true of any other package, be it Matlab or whatever. 
Have you seen FindMinimum docs? http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FindMinimum.html. It's pretty scarce on the methods available and what options you can supply to them.
I have read it several times, yes. They are definitely light on the details, but all the options are documented and explained in enough detail if you know what you are doing (don't forget to expand the "Options" part towards the end). That's why I said you also need a numerical methods textbook, you're only really supposed to fiddle with those if you know what you're doing as you're more likely to make things worse than better otherwise. The default is to try and automatically choose the best parameters for your problem and it's pretty good at it. 
Maybe this is what you mean: https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/14650/determining-the-default-method-used-in-optimization-and-root-finding-algorithms, although they talk about NMinimize

It isn't going to help you much, but I think you can turn ((1-p)*Integrate[Sqrt[(xb-xv)^2+(y-yv)^2], {y,yv-dv,yv+dv}]+ Integrate[Sqrt[(xb-xv)^2+(y-yv)^2], {y,0,yv-dv}]+ Integrate[Sqrt[(xb-xv)^2+(y-yv)^2], {y,yv+dv,1}]) into (Integrate[Sqrt[(xb-xv)^2+(y-yv)^2], {y,0,1}]- p*Integrate[Sqrt[(xb-xv)^2+(y-yv)^2], {y,yv-dv,yv+dv}])
I am just guessing now: the first inequality's LHS is quite scary looking with scary integration - is it possible that Mathematica engine just can't find analytical solution?
Thank you very much I am going to try that then. But what does: &gt;-I Abs[xb - xv] \[NotElement] Reals Mean? And do I just put it in the next tab? Here is a funny picture (i.e. how I feel using mathematica) : https://xkcd.com/1838/
I have already tried to just integrate it, and it gave me an answer with like 20 pages of conditions...
As it is trying to solve your problem it finds a condition that must be True and it is that condition. This Simplify[-I Abs[xb-xv] \[NotElement] Reals, 1&gt;xb&gt;0&amp;&amp;1&gt;xv&gt;0&amp;&amp;xb!=xv] shows xb!=xv with xb and xv real is enough. It just didn't simplify it.
Thank you!
The best I have been able to get it to do is dv &gt; 1/(2(2 dv p-1))((yv-1)Sqrt[(yv-1)^2+(xb-xv)^2]- yv Sqrt[yv^2+(xb-xv)^2]+2 p dv Sqrt[dv^2+(xb-xv)^2]+ 2 p (xb-xv)^2 ArcTanh[dv/Sqrt[dv^2+(xb-xv)^2]]- (xb-xv)^2(Log[Sqrt[yv^2+(xb-xv)^2]-yv]- Log[Sqrt[(yv-1)^2+(xb-xv)^2]-yv1])) That doesn't provide the five explicit formulas telling what each of the five variables must be. But it has cracked each of your integrals. Decades ago people came up with problems that were at the limit of their abilities to solve. Now with Mathematica and 32 gigabytes people come up with problems that are whatever they can type in.
Thank you very very much for the extra effort! xb and xv are constant so it is that big of a deal that they stick together might even make it easier when I start taking derivatives. But later on I have a couple of more formulas in which I only have xv on its own and xb is unknown like yb is not known in this case. 
Sure. Just use the variables themselves. Mathematica is good at solving using only variables. Can you tell us a bit more about what is required by the assignment?
https://i.imgur.com/NNqrGPv.png here is something from last week's assignment. both equations appear twice, the first without substituted values, and the second with values substituted in. I've been coding in the first version of the equation, copying it, and manually changing the variables to their values. for particularly long equations like that one for delta dedx, it can take some effort and i'll probably fuck it up some day. i was just wondering if there was a built in operation in mathematica to make that second equation version automatically, rather than making it by hand 
Yeah, I think you will want to use Quantity[]. You might not even get credit if you are editing in the units by hand. It depends on your teacher, I guess.
i should clarify: i'm not using the actual output from mathematica. I've been taking screenshots of mathematica outputs and putting them into a word document. The professor doesn't care what program I use to display calculations, I've just found mathematica to be a pretty valuable program for typing equations and simultaneously solving them. I did the first assignment using Word's built in equation editor and it was far too unwieldy, time consuming, and it doesn't actually compute anything. Mathematica lets me make reasonably pretty equations reasonably fast (I don't know LaTeX yet), and I can actually use mathematica to solve at the same time. 
I‚Äôd suggest looking into `Hold[]` and rather than setting the variables directly create a little environment eg. `env = {g -&gt; 9.81, ‚Ä¶}`. Then you write your equation symbolically `eq1 = f == m a` and with substitutions `eq1 ./ env`. The substitutions will evaluate but that‚Äôs where you‚Äôll have to play with using `Hold` to substitute in place without evaluating the expression. 
I like shizzy0's Hold[] comment, and just want to add that you can output using TraditionalForm[], perhaps within TeXForm[] and with a TeX editor like www.sharelatex.com to make super pretty PDF's to turn in. 
On top of that, don't use quantity manually. Use the natural language input and just add the units. It leads to much more natural looking code while units are still actually covered. 
This expression evaluates to a scalar constant, but for some reason it's being plotted as a linear function of x. What is causing this?
I did the same thing, but for me it came out right. No idea what could be the problem, but I am quite sure that the equation of the line in your figure is: VB[10, 7.5, 10] - 2 VB[10, 7.5, 10]/2.5 (x - 7.5) This might be a clue.
Having lingering global definitions is a prime cause for the kind of confusing behavior you see. Check which global symbols are currently defined like this: ?Global`* I'd recommend you remove the definitions for the offending symbols (eg using Remove[] or Clear[]), or just restart your kernel or Mathematica entirely and then retry this. Also, look at the Definition of your 'VB' function to see if it's what you expect it to be: ??VB As a side note, it is recommended practice to never define user symbols to start with capital letters in Mathematica. That way, you will never have interference with built-in symbols that all start with capitals, see http://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/DefiningVariables.html. 
try LinearSolve
Dude... This is basic linear algebra. You should cover this in your first damn lecture. Regardless, this isn't a mathematica question, this is a general math homework question. But I'll bite anyways. Set up your system. Get it in row reduced echelon form. From there inspect your system. Assuming a 3x3 system, with variables x1, x2, and x3, you'll have something like 0 x3 = 0 (infinitely many solutions), 0 x3 = some number (no solution) and 1 x3 = some number (unique solution). You then need to solve a to get the above conditions, and note it might be x2, or x1 that the story defined as above, or multiple of them in which case you have to set up subsequent systems to solve derived from the first. This is the type of thing you should do by hand till you understand what the hell you are doing, and use Mathematica as a tool to check your answers, or when you get to dimensions 4 or higher. 
&gt; There is really not much of a secret here. Following basic (n)etiquette, giving a clear statement of the problem, **refraining from casting aspersions on other posters** and/or various parts of the company, not hijacking another thread on Community, avoiding explicit expectation of an "official" company reply in a forum where responses from employees are strictly voluntary, that sort of thing. These are regarded as minimal requirements on Wolfram Community and, we rather expect, most other professional on-line communities.
Yay for unsubstantiated accusations and false documentation. How "professional".
&gt; How "professional". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2y8Sx4B2Sk
Man, you're still bent about that? I remember your post from months ago. Let it go already. Either use the product or don't.
I remember this guy, too. I kind of admire him. I think that Stephen Wolfram and this guy are a match made in heaven.
&gt; In Wolfram-speak, "professionalism" means commercial math-programs persistently giving mathematically-false answers. See.. right here. You can't _help_ but over-state the problem. Is the issue with the documentation being misleading, or is it with the program giving "mathematically false answers?" Those are two entirely different things, and you're trying to conflate them for reasons that are beyond our understanding, but in any general context _should_ be considered rude and/or unprofessional. You _yourself_ noted that the issue is even more subtle than what you've let on here -- that the documentation is technically correct, but only for even functions; and it was pointed out to you that the "Details and Options" for each of those functions are different and imply different things about the results. Then, because you didn't get what you were after on the Wolfram forums, you come here to stir the same pot.. as if it would lead to a _different_ result. What would you like us all to do? Say: "You're right! Wolfram is a _terrible_ program. It is _no way_ worth the $100 I paid for it, even though it literally serves me every day in producing work that's responsible for more than half my income because 14 lines of documentation are slightly misleading! Thank you so much for showing us the light!" You're a crank. Which is fine, just don't expect anyone else here or at Wolfram to _care_. Sorry for the rant.. but it's been all day dealing with people with this type of attitude. 
Ah it's you again. There's plenty wrong with the Wolfram documentation, for sure. And their process of handling reports is lacking. I don't know how to improve that, but what certainly *doesn't* help is writing posts on internet communities in a whiney style. Because that's how you come across, to be frank. The real question here is why you persist in using a product that consistently doesn't live up to your quality standards.
&gt; what certainly doesn't help is writing posts on internet communities in a whiney style. Because that's how you come across, to be frank. Look who's talking.
I think you need help. Your toxic personality is probably hurting you in real life, too.
i stopped caring about the docu of wolfram ...
I know right? I find a new minor defect in Mathematica every other day. Perhaps a more productive use of time would be creating an unofficial errata instead of making angry posts on Reddit.
https://www.reddit.com/r/Mathematica/comments/7dg0lg/wolframs_moderator_explains_why_mathematica/dpy5qtz/
Says the guy making angry posts.
&gt; Either use the product or don't. Because you can't bear it when people speak unflattering, true facts about certain computer programs? Sucks for you.
Hahaha, you're not even trying anymore. That doesn't even make sense as a response.
&gt; Either use the product or don't. Let's back up a bit, to where you wrote: &gt; Either use the product or don't. On the surface that's a very dumb thing to say, if you meant it literally. Obviously, I already either use the product or I don't, so why are you bothering to tell me to either use it or not use it?
Does this have anything to do with mathematica?
I come in peace. I actually am pretty impressed that you are able to find and document so many inconsistancies in the documentation. Do you actively look for them? Have you tried sending email directly to Stephen Wolfram? I bet that he would be interested to hear the inconsistencies even if the official Wolfram moderators try to censor you.
Clearly self promotion
It always baffles me when people dump word salad statements like this on the internet and then magically expect people to pick up what they are on about. Is this merely a language thing? A cultural difference? Perhaps some kind of a psychopathological lack of empathy? 
Always include code
Thank you! Couldn't have said it better.
That's a cool trick, where do people learn this stuff?
Additionally, after a FullSimplify, is there a way of knowing exactly which simplifications were actually applied?
I could see this being useful. I almost wonder if you (or Wolfram dev team) could speed up (Full)Simplify (or add an optional new operational mode) by assuming equations in a notebook use similar types of simplification operations and then prioritizing which operations to try first. That way you could stop it before it completes an exhaustive search of all possible simplifications and still (maybe) get a close-to-ideal answer.
Try NSolve[]
It's based around a Windows input panel thing. When I last used it, which was like five years ago, it worked just fine and was quite cute. Just found it slower than just typing the code though. Anyways, just use the math input panel from Windows and you're sorted. It should work well, though the Mathematica interface isn't touch oriented/friendly so just keep that in mind. If you're just doing notes I can recommend using OneNote since it can do equation solving inter alia. 
Solve does so symbolically. If it doesn't work try NSolve. Just like some things need NIntegrate when they can't be integrated symbolically. 
I didn't realize OneNote had that functionality. Good to know. Anyone know what engine MS is using for the math?
No clue. Microsoft used to have a home grown CAS and it's probably the remnants of that. It does basic stuff. Limited, but fine. Bit slow though... 
When i run this line of code it either just returns the code with no message or just continues to run. Does anyone know what i need to do to get this to run? I know the answer for V is 1.03 but i am trying to run this example from class because if it works it will make a question on my final much easier. Thanks
Perhaps supply some assumptions for f and v? Like, if they are reals, or even better, some are strictly positive, etc. 
Have you tried using Table and exporting it as a csv?
If you solve for f via the second equation first, you obtain f=(2.256582451009595`*^-13 (2.155`*^11-1.2050000071`*^10 v^2))/v^2; at which point, solving for v gives at least one solution NSolve[(21.55-(7.1*10^-9)v^2==(443.148f+1.205)v^2),v] yielding v -&gt; 1.34512
You can extract the data points directly from the plot: ParametricPlot[ Evaluate[{x[t], y[t]} /. solution, {t, 0, orbtime}]][[1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1]] In combination with the Export[] function, these data can be exported in a format that can be interpreted by an external program. 
Mathematica has a vague yet significant distinction between graphics and images. Export["file.png",Graphics[code]] is tricky, giving parameters to Export helps, giving parameters to Graphics helps more. An expensive yet easy solution is to use Rasterize[Graphics[code],ImageSize-&gt;imSiz,RasterSize-&gt;rasSiz]. I often end up doing Image[ImageData[Graphics[code]]]. I expect your problem has a similar source. Make sure you're happy with how something looks as an image via one of these explicit 'force image' methods, and then export that. Do provide a demo if this hasn't helped!
/u/sidneyc has ID'd the problem. If you want a more local fix you could wrap the plotted VB call in Evaluate.
For numerical solution of general non-linear algebraic equations rather use `RootFind`. `NSolve` sometimes has a peculiar behavior.
[removed]
Thanks GeEom! The rasterization method worked well. Despite being a bit slow, it let me get the image resolution that I wanted. The difference between Graphics and Images is interesting, it would be nice if it automatically chose to Export with the resolution seen in the notebook. I will look at the Image[ImageData[#]] method and see how that compares to the rasterize method. Thanks
Remind me and I‚Äôll send my method for exporting light weight publication quality pdf‚Äôs. On my phone and gotta make dinner before I‚Äôll have time to get to the computer 
"Magnify" may also help a lot. 
YES! this was it! I forgot to convert one of the constants in the second equations and once i used find root it worked! Thanks!
Selenium? Requests? They might have a policy on web scraping which you should attempt to abide by. 
[removed]
Do they not have an API? 
Are you from India?
Sure why not.
I think he wanted to know because of all those Indian websites that basically clone places like stack exchange for ad revenue etc. 
There are probably better venues to ask this. The Meta Mathematica SE is one option.
Ah! I did think it a little odd. 
By the way, a serious answer to your question is that you can and quite easily although using an api would be best. You could write your own crawler/spyder with mathematica, I have, it worked really well, and was quite easy. That said using python and one of their frameworks dedicated for it would probably be the easiest and best. 
Yes. It can help you. In fact this is trivial... If you want proper help attempt it, and post your code for critique. 
Well first of all, you can simplify your expression by dividing by i0 and taking log of both sides. You will be left with an equation to represent a and b using your measured values. Mathematica can do all this for you by using Solve. 
Do you know what version of Mathematica the cdf was made with, and what version of Mathematica you have now? Is the CDF a normal one or an enterprise one? 
So you want to add a button to a notebook that automatically exports all graphics in that notebook in a particular file format?
Yes, or the current or last graphical output. I'm looking for the graphics of the plot function that shows the paths of the three points. I'd like to be able to play with the values, then export the plot. My goal is to learn how an "export current/last graphical output" feature can be added and then see if I can add it to other similar scripts.
Well if your most recent output was a graphics object, then you can do `Export["myPNG.png", %]` to evaluate it as a .png file (or whatever file type you want from `$ExportFormats`. If it's not the most recent graphic that you want to export, then you'll want to give the graphic a name and export the named graphic: `pl = Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 10}] Export[Export["myPNG.png", pl]` This can certainly all be incorporated to be within a button, but that's a little more complicated.
Right. What you described is about how far I got messing around on my own. What I was hoping to find out how to do is to run the Manipulate [ ] function, and after tweaking the plot exporting it.
Okay. Try something like this: ``` Manipulate[ Column[{pl = Plot[Sin[n x], {x, 0, 10}, ImageSize -&gt; Large], Button["Export!", Export["plot.png", pl]]}], {n, 1, 10}] ```
I should mention this is my first time using Mathematica, it's for my Calculus 1 class extra credit (literally all we have to do is plot this vector field and plot y=e^x (I'm sure I can figure that one out though). We've never used Mathematica before in high school.
The arguments to your call to Evaluate are in the wrong spot. Take a look at the applications for [VectorPlot](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/VectorPlot.html).
I'm following the exact syntax under the first Application, just substituting sin[x,y] with [y].
No, you've replaced the whole derivative with D[y], and are trying to pass {{x,y}} as an option to Evaluate, hence your error. Move the square brackets around: VectorPlot[Evaluate[D[y, {{x, y}}]], {x, -3, 3}, {y, -3, 3}, AspectRatio -&gt; 1]
Try: VectorPlot[{1, y}, {x, -3, 3}, {y, -3, 3}, AspectRatio -&gt; 1] To put one plot on top of another (for e^x ), pass them as arguments to Show[]: Show[VectorPlot[...], Plot[...] ] BTW, the constant e is represented in Mathematica as a capital "E": In[12]:= N[E] Out[12]= 2.72818 
Huh. Your vector syntax gave me something much more similar to what I would expect. the other guy's syntax gave me a bunch of up arrows. Thanks. And I already got the e^x graph but thanks for the tip nonetheless
Just change your qt default font. You should be able to do a decent bit with the style options for the various notebooks. Options Inspector should let you change a lot of the interface fonts too. From what I understand, you're out of luck when it comes to output though since not all fonts have all the required symbols. Ever do math with latex? You'll see that lots of fonts can't be used for math. I'd probably just stick with the default fonts. You'll probably just have a bad time changing them for input, output, or the interface. Not to say you can't, but I wouldn't. 
I've never really been able to use the option inspector. Alot of stuff is just grayed out and can't be edited. Worst of all, I'm too lazy to find out how to edit it. 
You need to create a stylesheet with the font definitions you like, and then you need to set the file path for that stylesheet in the options inspector: global options -&gt; file locations -&gt; DefaultStyleDefinitions.
Really? Whilst I'll admit it's not perfect, it's always worked pretty decently for me. Hmm, guess it's luck of the draw. Firefox, Chrome, lots of software has the stupid registry style settings setup. Whilst I dislike it, it functions well... 
I guess it would be like getting used to terminal when I first started using linux.
I guess getting used to the option editor would be like when I first got into the linux cli. It'll just take some time for me to understand.
Specify plot range-&gt; all for the second plot, too. 
Sorry, coming back a bit late. But yeah I copy pasted the exact same thing for the second plot, just different data. Plus the first one shows that it does specify plot range, but there is still a chunk missing.
Using 11.0, I got this error Syntax::sntxf: "{" cannot be followed by "[Theta],0,2[Pi]}".
Come on, man. Put "PlotRang-&gt;All" inside the second Plot. It's really not hard. 
I can help. I'm on mobile atm, but I'd be happy to help out this afternoon.
To define an equation it's possible to just do something like: y == x^2 But a lot of the time you want to do it as a function like this: y[x_] := x^2 Read the docs. Work through this: https://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction/2nd-ed/ The basics will get you going, the total work will make you a God to a lot of people. 
OS? Including desktop and distro if applicable. Version? The default highlighting is rather restrained, but the more colourful highlighting is just a radio button under preferences somewhere. My highlighting works fine. 
Hello sorry for this delay if you have time would you please inform me. Can i ask my questions. Thanks 
Thanks a lot. Indeed I wanted to write the second derivative but yet I can not. 
Sure, go ahead and post it. I'm on travel over the next few days, but I'll try and put together an answer when I get a chance.
First, you need to calculate the two lines, that fit both ends of your points. If you have this, you can interpolate all your points and write down the two integrals. One for the bottom area and one for the top area. Let's call them int1[x] and int2[x]. Clearly, the point you are trying to find is an x, where both integrals are equal. This can be done in a final step using e.g. FindRoot[(int1[x]-int2[x])^2, ..] with an appropriate starting point x0 in the middle. This problem should behave very well. For integration, you should use NIntegrate. That's all one can say without having the actual points. 
Thank you so much.well actually I am trying to sovle an equation but from the beginning I have problem, I posted the photo of the screen in my profile, is it possible for you to take a look at it. 
Use prime notation... y''[x] 
Yes I used but I have problem in taking the output. Would you please look at photo I upload in my profile. 
No photo in your original post. I've checked desktop and mobile. 
Well do you think how I can show the photo, cause I posted it before and unfortunately I don't know what is the problem. Sorry
I can't see a photo. If you can link to it by pasting the web address in reply to this comment, I'll take a look at it.

If you do not have a space, then *Mathematica* treats them as one variable called "kx" not as "k*x" which is what you want. Try: equation1=m x"[t] == -k x[t] equation1 = (equation1/. k -&gt; w m )/m Also, for the line: Force = F[x] You should write, instead: Force = F[x_] This will prevent possible problems down the road, since "x_" is a "generic variable" whereas "x" is an object. Hope this helps. I will try and look at it more if not, but I'm on travel and so limited.
Thank you for this idea, I found out a very similar way :}.

Woooow, that works. Thank you sooooooo much. 
Glad I could help
Hey, sorry it took me so long to respond, but Christmas time has been hectic. Anyway, I'm using Windows 10 home and Mathematica Student edition 11.2; the odd thing is that the colors work perfectly fine on my laptop (which has the same OS and Mathematica version), but not at all on my desktop. [I uploaded a picture to imgur here](https://imgur.com/dLRAO4I) You'll see how all the example text is black - which is exactly how it appears when I attempt to use Mathematica. The lack of coloration is making it a bit of a pain in the butt to keep track of my code, comments, etc. 
Hi I was planning to purchase MMA actually, a student edition. It looks like your MMA student editions looks different from the Home or Professional edition. The toolbar on top looks different and yours has STUDENT EDITION written over it. So is the student edition in any way different or restricted than the other editions ? 
 ContourPlot[y^2 == x^3 + x^2, {x, -3, 3}, {y, -3, 3}] ContourPlot[(x^4 + y^4 - x^2 y^2)^2 == 9 x^2 y^2, {x, -3, 3}, {y, -3, 3}]
plot1=ContourPlot[y^2 == x^3 + x^2, {x, -3, 3}, {y, -3, 3}]; plot2=ContourPlot[(x^4 + y^4 - x^2 y^2)^2 == 9 x^2 y^2, {x, -3, 3}, {y, -3, 3}]; Show[plot1, plot2]

Do you think we're psychics or something?
And then call it with f[x], not f(x)
Not nearly enough time information for us to help you. What format is the data in, how are you importing it, what commands did you run, what errors did you get? We just aren't psychic... 
I think this is what you want, although I may have gotten the pattern slightly off: In[14]:= N@ Product[Sum[Sqrt[i], {i, 1, j, 2}]/ Sum[CubeRoot[i], {i, 2, j, 2}], {j, 2, 50}] Out[14]= 9.57576*10^8
Is this homework?
What have you tried so far? Post the code you have so we can make suggestions. As it stands this subreddit is intended to answer specific questions regarding Mathematica, not to do your homework for you.
It works, but it's not a very efficient method for Mathematica. Imagine we wanted the same thing in the range [1, 10^(7)]: {Prime@@Ordering[#, -1] + 1, Max@# - 1} &amp;@ Differences@Prime@Range@PrimePi@10^7 (evaluates in 1.2 seconds) Module[{p = 1, length = 0, pdif = 0, range}, While[Prime[p] &lt; 10^7, If[(pdif = Prime[p + 1] - Prime[p]) &gt; length, length = pdif; range = Range[Prime[p] + 1, Prime[p + 1] - 1];]; p++; ]; { Length[range], range } ] (evaluates in 46.4 seconds)
I actually did this method initially, but had convinced myself at the time that something about the mass distribution of the cylinder would make the simplification not work in the actual problem - with arguments I can't remember at all anymore. This looks completely reasonable. I guess that's what I get for doing math at 4am. That said, I still feel like the integrals should get the same answer - all I did was integrate over the formula for area given [here](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CircularSegment.html), with an h-value of sqrt(3)*a (With a being the height of the cross-section being looked at - and sqrt(3)*a coming from the triangle diagram you posted), from 0 to h. The second integral did the same, but assumed r = 1. Even at 3pm that seems like a valid if needlessly complex way to calculate half of the volume of a cylinder. Thanks again. 
I think you might just have confused which variables represent which quantities - "a" shouldn't be both the height of the cross-section and the variable you're integrating over. [If we define "a" as the height of the cross-section and "x" as the variable of integration,](https://i.imgur.com/odBHDke.png) the volume is given by Integrate[r^2 ArcCos[(r-a)/r] - (r-a) Sqrt[2 r a - a^2], {x, 0, h}] Substitute in `a = 2 r x / h` and [you're good to go.](https://sandbox.open.wolframcloud.com/app/objects/a7d418e9-0dcb-4fd8-9ede-f06f77db085a)
I'm not entirely sure I follow why we can't integrate over a - [this](https://i.imgur.com/Z1lYigm.png) is the situation I was originally trying to describe with my integrals. In it I've calculated the h-value (as defined by wolfram's site's formula) in terms of a as sqrt(3)a, and in letting a vary from 0 to h in the integral, I should be sweeping out the full volume - right? I do agree that your way seems a bit nicer, but still don't understand why mine wouldn't also get the same answer. Does mine get an answer through Mathematica at all? Also your link returned a 403 error. 
My mistake, your way should work. Disregard my last post. For the r=1 simplification, Mathematica can express the integral in terms of elementary functions, but is unable to analytically solve setting the integral equal to œÄh/2. [It can be numerically solved to give the correct answer.](https://i.imgur.com/jCG66Ts.png)
Thanks. I know it didn't really matter since I was overcomplicated what it needed to be anyways, but it makes me feel a bit better to know I was at least still using valid methods. 
I know that you're suppose to use variable l to see if the function given with a specific range for n,m and p can create multiple ways of getting each value that is represented by l I did l=Range[0,20] possible = Flatten[Table[ Sqrt[n] + CubeRoot[m] + p, {n, 0, 15}, {m, 0, 15}, {p, 0, 15}]] but it didn't execute the functions correctly becuase it only took into account of n,m,p. I am having trouble trying to make the fucntion evaluate ways of getting l = 0--&gt;20 given the fact that the n,m and p have certain range of numbers to use to get l values. {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \ 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, OutputSizeLimit`Skeleton[4041], 5 + 14^(1/3) + Sqrt[15], 6 + 14^(1/3) + Sqrt[15], 7 + 14^(1/3) + Sqrt[15], 8 + 14^(1/3) + Sqrt[15], 9 + 14^(1/3) + Sqrt[15], 10 + 14^(1/3) + Sqrt[15], 11 + 14^(1/3) + Sqrt[15], 12 + 14^(1/3) + Sqrt[15], 13 + 14^(1/3) + Sqrt[15], 14 + 14^(1/3) + Sqrt[15], 15 + 14^(1/3) + Sqrt[15], 15^(1/3) + Sqrt[15], 1 + 15^(1/3) + Sqrt[15], 2 + 15^(1/3) + Sqrt[15], 3 + 15^(1/3) + Sqrt[15], 4 + 15^(1/3) + Sqrt[15], 5 + 15^(1/3) + Sqrt[15], 6 + 15^(1/3) + Sqrt[15], 7 + 15^(1/3) + Sqrt[15], 8 + 15^(1/3) + Sqrt[15], 9 + 15^(1/3) + Sqrt[15], 10 + 15^(1/3) + Sqrt[15], 11 + 15^(1/3) + Sqrt[15], 12 + 15^(1/3) + Sqrt[15], 13 + 15^(1/3) + Sqrt[15], 14 + 15^(1/3) + Sqrt[15], 15 + 15^(1/3) + Sqrt[15]} 
That is already a good start. Since you are only interested in those combinations of n,m,p that produce an integer outcome, you could filter the list you get from Flatten[Table... by applying Cases[ , _Integer] (this step is not necessary, but makes the list easier to work with as it is now short enough to check your results from the next step by hand). In a next step, you could count the number of appearances of each number from 0 to 20 and write them in a list, done.
It seems that defined a function for x[s] previously, in the same Mathematica session, in particular, it seems you have defined it as x[t_] := t^2 * Sin[t] ... or something similar. When you evaluate FullForm[x[s]], the Mathematica will first apply its definition of the previously defined x[t], so it will effectively evaluate FullForm[s^2 * Sin[s]]. This gives the expression you see. To make sure things work as expected, restart Mathematica, or execute a command that will make Mathematica forget about your definition of x, e.g. Remove[x] ... And then try again. 
I know that if you do this Count[{a, b, a, a, b, c, b}, b] for example You will get an output of 3 but how would you use this with a function and with range of values it can plug in (0 to 15) to get values of either 0,1,2...20
If you stored the previously calculated list of values in a variable, say `nmpList`, you could simply use `Table[Count[nmpList, i], {i,0,20}]`. Btw.: There are A LOT of alternatives for achieving the same thing in a more concise, efficient or otherwise superior way. But I think this is probably the most straightforward way for a beginner.
Thank you, it's my introductory course to mathematica, so it's my first first time using the program. 
I am doing an introductory course to mathematica, and I'm a beginner. Some of these tools I have not used yet. Is there another way to solve the question? 
1) You can use count on the output of `FactorInteger` if you specify the pattern that matches odd exponents correctly. If you don't know how patterns work you should definitely read up on them as they are a very important concept in Mathematica. (Tipp: _?OddQ matches odd integers. 2) I think it's quite clear that they want you to calculate the alternating sum of all unique prime factors of n. To do this in a concise way you should take a look at Take[list, ...] (or in short form list[[...]], where btw you can type `ESC [ [ ESC` and `ESC ] ] ESC` in Mathematica to make it a distinct symbol to not go insane with all the other square brackets) and especially slicing to make a list of unique prime factors. You could then either store that in a variable and use Sum or, more elegantly, take a look at the output of `FromDigits[Reverse@{1,2,3}, x] //Expand` (`//Expand` is only to prevent Mathematica from displaying the polynomial in a weird way and is not necessary). What happens if you substitute -1 for x? 
So, FactorInteger[n] has done a lot of the work for you. You now have a list of prime factors and their powers. My hint for figuring out the rest is to think about how you might do this by hand. Like, if someone gave you a list of prime factors and their powers like for n=2,434,500 it would be: {{2,2},{3,2},{5,3},{541,1}} how would you use this list to determine the answer to your question? Now, hand write a procedure that could work if the list had been 10,000 pairs instead of the 4 above (this is called pseudocode, since it is not quite code, but articulates the process that you would want to encode). Now that you have the process set, try to translate each line of pseudo code into Mathematica code. Mathematica has really great documentation online and in its help menu (lots of examples, which is unique). If this you cannot answer your question using the help menu, then type it out in plain English and google it. StackOverflow results have been particularly helpful for me. Lastly, a tool that might be useful is a "for loop". Hope that helps! 
I was actually looking for how to compute it after putting in FactorInteger[n]. I already know that the exponents are the second variable y in the {{x,y}..{..,..}}. The Loop function was not taught yet. 
Well, `OddQ` is a normal function in Mathematica, but when talking about patterns some functions can be used in a short notation, which is explained on the documentation page about "PatternTest (?)". For more infos about patterns in Mathematica, google is you friend.
 First@MaximalBy[SplitBy[Range[7919], PrimeQ], Length]
MaximalBy[l, p] returns a list with the elements of l that maximize p. In this case p is Length so it will result in a list with the lists with greatest length. First gives the first element of the list, in this case the only element of the list. First@x is equivalent to First[x].
While we are at it --- have to also point out that you mean 'dot product' when you said 'cross product.' (And, as you noted, you aren't supposed to use the built-in one, but can use vOne . vTwo to confirm you get the same answer - which you will after you change the 0 to a 1.)
No problem :-)
Not much 
 f=x^2+y^3-3*x*y-2; g=x*Sin[x+y]+6*y; h=(x^3+y^3)/(x^2+E^(y/100)); p1=Table[... will correctly calculate your triples of points. Now since your homework questions don't seem to care what the x,y values are and only care what the f,g,h values are, perhaps you could skip including the x,y and skip calculating three different tables. What would happen if you calculated Table[{f,g,h}...] Then could consider writing a function that would take that kind of triple and returning either True or False for your first question, another to answer your second and another to answer your third. Then you might think how you could use each of those functions on the whole table you created.
I need more clarification, it's my first time using Mathematica as a class :P
Do everything one small step at a time. Try making the first change I suggested and look at the values in p1, p2 and p3. Verify that much is working like you suggested. Then try calculating a new table p123=Table[{f,g,h}, {x,-1,1,0.1},{y,-1,1,0.1}] and look at what that contains. Can you think how you could use that to get the answer to your first question? If you can't then could you think how to create a table that would give you something closer to what you need to answer the question?
This isn't really a place where we solve homework problems for people. What would get a better response is showing us code that you wrote and asking why it does not work
Try writing your functions as: f[x_,y_]:=x^2 + y^3 - 30x * y - 2 g[x_,y_]:=x * Sin[x+y] + 6y h[x_,y_]:=(x^3+y^3)/(x^2 + e^(y/100)) Then for your tables write: p1 = Table[f[x,y],{x,-1,1},{y,-1,1}] ...and so on 
Four spaces before a line to make it easy to read. Anyways a couple things I immediately noticed: Functions are done with a := not just an equal e.g. f[x_] := x^2 All variables used in the function should always be declared at the beginning unless you want to make a giant mess of things and should be followed by an underscore in the function arguements e.g. g[Theta_] := Theta - Pi Variables in functions arguements are seperated by commas not just chained onto each other with [] e.g. h[x_, y_] := x*y As a general aside. Never start variables names with capital letters. Reserve that for functions as is good style. 
Oh yes I would never use a capital letter for a variable. There was suppose to be a backslash in front of every [Theta], I think Reddit translated that into something else. It was suppose to be the literal symbol, theta. Both functions are of a single variable, t. I will convert the code into something more traditional to make it easy to read I've used = sign before and had no problems. I will give the := a try when I get to school. Thank you for your speedy reply
The errors you are getting both suggest that you have accidentally used a single equals sign instead of two equals signs to make an equation. Check over your code, quit the kernel and try again. If you copy the first argument to NDSolve onto a new line and evaluate it it may help see where the error is.
Right. I have checked like a hundred times and the equations and initial conditions all have ==. I've also tried writing two Differential Equations directly into the first argument of NDSolve as well and it's still the same. Under Evaluation I clicked Quit Kernal -&gt; Local. I'm going to research further research the kernal as I am not very familiar with it. Thank you for your reply
A single equal is an assignment operation. If it worked then that is coincidental and by luck, that doesn't mean that's how you should do it. 
Or change the NDSolve to Test (or whatever you like) so it doesn't evaluate and post the output of running that.
Okay here should be a link to a screen shot of my default attempt https://imgur.com/d8ZV5YW
That may explain why I get "true" for this problem and then "0" for another one similar. Thetaprime[0] is stored as something. I guess ClearAll or Clear["Global`*"] won't fix that? Maybe I can set the value for thetaprime[0] beforehand. Friday morning I will try this line of code, no text, in a new notebook on a different pc at school. I will update you all then 
No, you don't want to set the value of Œ∏'[0] to be anything, it needs to be free to assign that itself. Clear doesn't remove values for derivatives of theta. You can type Œ∏'[0]=. to remove the stored definition, or figure out where it is coming from and delete that.
A single equal is correct here actually. := is SetDelayed, which only evaluates the right hand side of the assignment when it is called, which for this case is fine as nothing on the right hand side depends on anything else. Incorrect use of SetDelayed when you only need Set can cause your code to be very slow.
Well today I learnt something new. Thanks for the heads up. 
Success! Thank you so much for your help. The setting Œ∏'[0]=. was all it needed. I never would have considered the text above to be interfere with the code below. Thank you for making that obvious for me
It is unclear what exactly you want, can you give an example? First thing to realize is that If[] in Mathematica is not a *statement* but rather a *function*. Perhaps it helps to known that if you evaluate the function call If[condition, expr1, expr2] the *unused* expression (i.e., expr1 if the condition is False, and expr2 if the condition is True) is not evaluated. This can be used to _avoid_ division by zero. Lastly, /u/KraZug is right. On the off-chance that this is not homework, it may well be that you've picked the wrong approach to address your actual problem.
That‚Äôs what I figured. This isn‚Äôt for homework but for research. I‚Äôve tried using the if statement to define it as zero but it didn‚Äôt work the way I hoped it would. 
You are probably best asking this on the Mathematica stackexchange site.
Thanks. Mathematica support got back to me today, so maybe they can help.
Do you know for certain a solution exists? Exactly what code did you use?
If Solve doesn't work, and it's not a differential equation then make use of NSolve. Remember, lots of things can't be solved analytically. Do you know if an analytical solution does in fact exist? If you want to really get into it, you can tune some parameters with Solve that might yield different results, but it's highly unlikely that you'll do much better than the default routine unless you know the required method. 
Don't post screenshots of your code. Post your code, indented by four spaces.
Have you seen that your x and y values run from -10 to 10 while the z-direction of your surface runs from 0 to 200? It is not the flat thing it appears to be. Look at Plot3D[x^2 + 2 + Sin[3 x - 2 y], {x, -1, 5}, {y, -7, -1}, PlotRange -&gt; {{-1, 5}, {-7, -1}, {0, 15}}, BoxRatios -&gt; Automatic ] and then at Show[ Graphics3D[{Opacity[.5], Cylinder[{{2, -4, 0}, {2, -4, 10}}, 1]}], Plot3D[x^2 + 2 + Sin[3 x - 2 y], {x, -1, 5}, {y, -7, -1}, RegionFunction -&gt; Function[{x, y, z}, (x - 2)^2 + (y + 4)^2 &lt; 1], PlotPoints -&gt; 50], PlotRange -&gt; {{-1, 5}, {-7, -1}, {0, 10}}, BoxRatios -&gt; Automatic ] and you should see what happens.
Do it in a table, then you can easily use ParallelTable. You might also want to rework your NIntegrate to optimize numerical integration method. Integrating over +/- infinity also makes me think it'll be trying symbolic preprocessing which can really slow things down. PsiTable = ParallelTable[ Psi[rx, ry, 1, 2, 0, 3, 7], {rx, -10, 10, 1}, {ry, -10, 10, 1}] Then ListDensityPlot[PsiTable] 
What does `AtomicQ@Rational[6/7]` return?
This is documented [here](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/BasicObjects.html): &gt;You can extract the head of the object using Head, but you cannot directly extract any of its other parts. along with some more useful information. Again, not _explicitly_ the why, but it is documented. Sometimes you won't always get down to the level that your curiosity desires, though.
Oh, I see. As far as I can tell, there's not a good reason, but I may be wrong about this. If you submitted feedback, they're usually pretty good about getting back to you with thoughtful responses...
When you introduce an input, Mathematica first converts it into a tree with nodes that can be symbols, strings, integers or real numbers. We could call this kind of Mathematica expressions, normal expressions. So initial inputs are normal expressions, but once an expression is evaluated, all kinds of objects can arise. In particular you couldn't have efficient byte arrays, associations or rational numbers if they had to be represented as normal expressions. What you see when you ask for the full form of one of these objects is a normal expression that when evaluated is transformed into that object. But that expression is not identical to the actual object. For example if you define: x = Hold@Rational[5, 4]; y = Hold@Evaluate@Rational[5, 4]; Depth[x] will be 3, while Depth[y] will be 2. If you ask for x[[1, 1]] you will obtain 5, but y[[1, 1]] will produce an error.
Yeah, unfortunately I'm certain :( I'm at the University of Minnesota Duluth, and only students at the main University in the Twin Cities have access to the school's license package (or whatever it's called).
This is an insightful answer; thank you!
So I've actually always found Wolfram to really love students and to always be willing to help them out. My suggestion is to send their support an email, explain the situation and tell them that the university IT don't want to help. They might give you a year or license for free or maybe at a massively discounted rate. A friend of mine was in a similar pickle and got the full monty for (I think) $70 and he'd just graduated and wanted to use Mathematica for projects to help get employed... So give them a call, they can be very generous with discounts. The Raspberry Pi version isn't bad at all. As long as you're not working with huge matrices, machine learning or something clearly computationally expensive then you'll probably not suffer too much. You will suffer in that your work flow will be split between two machines. Lastly, using a jupyter notebook with python, sympy, and numpy isn't that bad. It doesn't come close to being of the same quality or as well documented or polished or a lot of things, but it should be just fine for most purposes. 
I am a passionate user of Mathematica, most of my workflow takes place in it, but it is expensive. In addition to creating an open source system from Jupyter/Numpy/Sympy, which you can get packaged from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), there is an open source system for mathematics at [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org/). You may also want to look into [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/), especially if you're doing a lot of linear algebra. Each of these systems has strengths and weaknesses, but none of them have the integration with computable data or outstanding documentation that Mathematica has. Finally, you may want to check out [Wolfram Programming Lab](http://www.wolfram.com/programming-lab/). It has a free option and one that is $10/month, among others.
You can try Collect[equation, d]
What do you mean? Running in Task Manager, or evaluations won't complete? If you quit Mathematica, delete all these directories http://support.wolfram.com/kb/12464, then restart it, does that help?
Thanks for the help! The evaluations won't complete. I tried to delete the directories and that allowed me to solve a 2+2 equation. I tried the NSolve again and its still not completing the evaluation. 
What is your actual NSolve command that is not completing... I want the code...
Why not listname[[1]] ?
Yeah, did that and it works not exept in the case when i wanna release it then it looks like this: http://prntscr.com/inumz1 even the integral alone doesn't solve right, as far as i can see it uses the ingeral instead of x for whatever reason. Thanks for help anyway!
haha ok. I always just use the ‚ÄòIntegrate[x^n , x]‚Äô notation to avoid confusion
You gotta separately substitute 1/x for x in the equation and [mess with the x ticks](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Ticks.html) I believe (adding something like `Ticks -&gt; {Table[{x, 1/x}, {x, 0, 20}], Automatic}`)
Neat, I'm excited to check out the FindEquationalProof function
Thank you. I will try that.
For this type of stuff you can give blender a shot. It's open source and can do a lot of things that Mathematica isn't built to (or that would require extensive work making a library). If you want a code-based 3D rendering engine, I suggest POV-ray. It has a syntax not unlike (a interpreted sort-of variant of) C. If you want a shallower learning curve with regard to syntax, You can also look into [Vapory](http://zulko.github.io/blog/2014/11/13/things-you-can-do-with-python-and-pov-ray/), which is a pov-ray generator for python. If you get it all set up (not sure about what your OS is) it is reasonably straightforward to start generating really high-quality mathematical images.
Thank you for taking time to read my question. I actually tried to use Blender first and got a fine image but Mathematica's graphics produces a better looking for my particular purpose as it is going to be used for the scientific presentation.
Hmm, I'm not aware of any scheme to do constructive solid geometry in Mathematica and certainly not to get it to render in a reasonable time. By comparison, what you want in POV SDL is something like: camera { location &lt;0, 2, -3&gt; look_at &lt;0, 1, 2&gt; } light_source { &lt;2, -3, -3&gt; color &lt;1, 1, 1&gt; } intersection { sphere {&lt;0, 0, 0&gt; , 1} sphere {&lt;.2, .5, .2&gt; , 1} sphere{&lt;-.2, .2, -.2&gt; , 1} texture{ pigment{ color rgb&lt;1, 0, 0&gt; } } } union { sphere {&lt;0, 0, 0&gt; , 1} sphere {&lt;.2, .5, .2&gt; , 1} sphere {&lt;-.2, .2, -.2&gt; , 1} texture{ pigment{ color rgbf&lt;1, 0, 0, 0.1&gt; } } } 
Thank you for spending time on it. I kinda did it fine except for some refinement. I found the post in Stackoverflow where someone presented the function to generate the intersection of objects. I can post the result some time later today. 
just transform into exp representation get 1/2 in and then transform back to get the actual value. i dont see what is complicated there? harder is i^i to calculate.
yup thats what i had in my mind.
You know that P(t_start) == P(t_end); can you solve this for t_start and t_end? 
I see, sorry mate.
You can view the fraction sqrt(a/b) as sqrt(a)/sqrt(b), a property which should allow you to simplify answers b, c, and d. Also, try squaring the answers to see if any of them come out to 3 + sqrt(3). (You are in the wrong subreddit. We post about the software called Mathematica. You want /r/MathHelp or /r/cheatatmathhomework.)
You need to define q(t) as a function first. Do: q[t_] := Q e^(-t/30) Solve[q[0] == 350, Q]
Oh! The underscore! Thanks!
And the `:=` 
The underscore forms a [pattern](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/Introduction-Patterns.html) which is basically find-n-replaced by the function definition. If you can grok patterns, you'll find them to be incredibly powerful.
This seems to evaluate to 1 for me: `w[a, 4]/w[4, a] /. w[i_, j_] :&gt; w @@ Sort[{i, j}]`
Indeed, but not for `w[5, w[1, 2]] / w[5, w[2, 1]]`.
Four spaces before code else people just don't bother reading it. Your code isn't too bad, but them the rulez.
That's perfect! Thank you very much!
It works indeed, thank you! After writing my message I also thought of `//. w[i_, j_] /; Hash[j] &lt; Hash[i] :&gt; w[j, i]`.
Capitalize sqrt as Sqrt. Mathematica is case sensitive.
And use Brackets [] when you call a function. Sqrt [insert expression here ]
Thank you!
Alright that solved my sum issues, now im just down to the modelfit issue! thank you
Protip: You can enclose text in the ` \` ` character to `Generate[Code[]]` (like for the `^` symbol.) Am I missing something, or are you not using *i* in the Sum[] formula? Is it not just 19 times your formula?
Ah yeah. So the x,y,z are supposed to be the data[[i]][[1]] data[[i]][[2]] data[[i]][[3]] but I didnt knaow how to do thT
Interesting. It actually turns out I was over complicating it a lot. I only had to do the nlmf on cos^2. But thats njce to know i dont need 8 brackets anymore
If I'm interpreting you right, you could try In[98]:= Clear[expr,cond] expr=1/(a x^2+b x+c); cond=Sqrt[b^2-4a c]&gt;0; Simplify[Integrate[expr,x],cond] Out[101]= -((2 ArcTanh[(b+2 a x)/Sqrt[b^2-4 a c]])/Sqrt[b^2-4 a c]) And then take a look at [this](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/19833/usage-of-assuming-for-integration/19894#19894) post on the Mathematica StackExchange. Another look at the core of this problem yields the different methods, and their consequences, of stipulating assumptions when integrating In[102]:= Integrate[expr,x,Assumptions-&gt;cond] Assuming[cond,Integrate[expr,x]] Simplify[Integrate[expr,x],cond] Out[102]= (2 ArcTan[(b+2 a x)/Sqrt[-b^2+4 a c]])/Sqrt[-b^2+4 a c] Out[103]= (2 ArcTan[(b+2 a x)/Sqrt[-b^2+4 a c]])/Sqrt[-b^2+4 a c] Out[104]= -((2 ArcTanh[(b+2 a x)/Sqrt[b^2-4 a c]])/Sqrt[b^2-4 a c]) Here we can see that even though we are telling Mathematica to do essentially the same thing just in a different order, it does some stuff in the back end that ends up yield a different result depending on the actual implementation.
The result is still complex and still wrong, unfortunately. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_integrals_of_rational_functions#Integrands_of_the_form_xm_/_(a_x2_+_b_x_+_c)n

This looks really good, I'll give it a try when I come home, but just looking at it it seems that this is what I'm looking for. Thank you very much for your help and time. 
If I were approaching this topic I would use Python or R which are much more widely accepted in the workplace than Mathematica. But, it all depends on what you are comfortable with in the end. Python has pandas, numpy and matplotlib which are just a few of the awesome packages for number crunching and manipulation. R has a ton of options for this type of work as well, but I'm not as familiar. 
I'd also add that python has sympy which allows you to do symbolic math similarly to Mathematica. On the other hand, sympy is atrociously slow for anything more than simple calculations. 
Thanks for your comments! I will definetely look into these Python packages, Im hearing about them for the first time and in general have no previous experience with any of it ( including Mathematica, so I will have to learn something new regardless)

I used Mathematica for part of my Master's thesis. I did not use it for the thesis proper, for that I used LaTeX. I used Mathematica mainly for some computations, visualization, and the production of figures for my thesis. You're more likely to find Python and R in the workplace owing to their availability and liberal licensing. That doesn't necessarily mean they're best, just cheap/free. But being a student, you might want to indulge in getting to choose your own tools while you still can before having to use whatever it is that'll be most convenient for your would-be employer. And Mathematica is cheap for students.
No. LaTeX doesn‚Äôt conventionally do any calculations. I had other code aside from Mathematica doing the heavy lifting. But while you‚Äôre investigating different tools, there‚Äôs Emacs‚Äô orgmode with babel that might be worth seeing if it fits your needs. 
When working with Mathematica it is often better to think in a more functional/data structure oriented fashion rather than a procedural program fashion. So to generate your first data set you can make it split it into a 50 by 10 matrix immediately: data = RandomVariate[ExponentialDistribution[5], {50, 10}]; Then you want to _sample_ 3 from each of the 10 distributions. A random sample is done with `RandomSample[list, n]`. `RandomSample[#, 3]&amp;` is a function that return three samples from the input, using `Map` you can apply this to each of the 50 lists of 10: Map[RandomSample[#, 3] &amp;, data]] To take the mean, you should use `Mean`, but you need to transpose the matrix first: Mean[Transpose[Map[RandomSample[#, 3] &amp;, data]]] So the complete program is: data = RandomVariate[ExponentialDistribution[5], {50, 10}]; Mean[Transpose[Map[RandomSample[#, 3] &amp;, data]]]
You can calculate it as following: DSolve[{q'[t]==-40 q[t]/1200, q[0]==350}, q[t], t]
Thank you so much. I definitely hated the unorganization of the data as well, so this is rven better than I expected! Really appreciate it
Sorry, I wasn't around a computer with Mathematica earlier. For the random samples of 3, I need 50 of these samples from each sample of 10, so 7500 altogether, as opposed to 3 per sample of 10. Sorry for the confusion!
Take a look at the [revision history](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/quick-revision-history.html). See if any new features are relevant to your interests and worth the upgrade.
new splash screen!
I don't think there is a built in function for that, but somthing like this should work. Generate 2 matrices, multiply one with I and ad them together RandomInteger[{-10, 10}, {4, 4}] + RandomInteger[{-10, 10}, {4, 4}] I // MatrixForm 
thank you! true.
Definitely an illuminating read on the history and differences between Mathematica and Jupyter/Python. Of course, not to mention, the big idea that in this day and age, the lack of *interactive* scientific publications does seem a bit silly, since most papers are accessed through the internet anyways. While it seemed to be not exactly anti-Mathematica, it didn't seem super pro- about it. That being said, it was, while being in favor of the Jupyter environment, a good discussion on the differences between them and the things at which each excel. I did enjoy the commentary on Stephen himself (that he's maybe a smidgen pretentious).

You can do this natively with `RandomComplex`: RandomComplex[{-1-I,1+I},{10,10}] The first list defines the corners in the complex plane; the second defines the size of the resultant `List`/matrix.
but does this gives me all integers? bcs iverting calc by hand with them aint easy.
Thanks for the advice! Thats a good point!
its alright! hmm i read you can tweak the precision and maybe get integers that way, i will give it a shot.
Lot's of awesome stuff to do with Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Sound/Signal Processing. Lot's has changed, and at the same time, very little has changed depending on what you are using Mathematica for.
Mathematica is a good tool for what you want to do. In fact Mathematica is quite big in the world of Quantitative Finance and Economics. Typically Mathematica is a research tool where algos are designed and tested then later translated to high performance C, Fortran and Cuda often using in house tools. Don't worry about what industry uses, you'll be trained once employed (many places have their own tools even) or can self learn quickly enough. Using what your professor advises means you have a source of support and he probably has a lot of experience and won't make the recommendation without good cause. I'll admit academics can hang onto tools a bit longer than they should, but they often have very good reasons for it. I like that the documentation is good, support is excellent, and you get a very consistent experience as well as having the best symbolics engine out there. Sympy and stuff chokes on stuff that Mathematica laughs at. Mathematica has really good integration with R so that isn't a big deal. Python has great tools and you can't go wrong with it, but Mathematica is really good. It's just such a consistent, unified experience with such great documentation that I think its a good bet.
That‚Äôs a wowüò≥
By no means do I mean any offense. This is a trivial question that can be answered by consulting Mathematica's (relatively) extensive documentation.
Do you mean you want to increase the length of one unit? Just grab a corner and drag. Otherwise if youre using olit function, use PlotRange if you start typing it, mathe.atica will suggest it and give you a link to the documentation. Use that. Its important to be able to learn a tool from a manual.
What is your question or what are you trying to say? I'm totally lost. Well done for formatting your code correctly. 
You want to use `SetDelayed`, not `Set`. That is, define your functions with `:=`, not `=`. You may have to clear `a` and `b` first, but that'll fix it.
Hey man thanks so much. https://pastebin.com/A61VR9FQ here's what I have now... no syntax errors, but for some reason my b,c, and (accordingly) f functions all output zero for all input. I don't think that's a phenomenon of the mathematics..any insight?
It's a demo of Mathematica and some alternatives. It works a bit like a tutorial too. One can also use the video to judge the speed of Mathematica on an old Raspberry Pi 1 (or Raspberry Pi Zero for $5). The video has closed captions.
Thank you, however, I won't lie.. I don't see the image size drop down anywhere.
Maybe your 'Suggestions Bar' is turned off. However, the same can be achieved by adding 'ImageSize' and 'AspectRatio -&gt; Full' to your plot. Something like Plot[Sin[x], {x, -Pi, Pi}, ImageSize -&gt; {400, 200}, AspectRatio -&gt; Full] 
Thanks, I managed to find the aspect ratio options under format &gt; options inspector &gt; graphics &gt; aspectratio. However, I have to hold shit to change the aspect, but at least I can do it! Thank you, my plot was not at all presenting the data in a way that allows you to imagine the movement of an object. Much appreciated!
The trick is that Wolfram Language/Mathematica provides `ComponentMeasurements[image, "BoundingBox"]` which gives the bounding box of objects in an image. This format can then be used by `ImageTrim`. We start by cleaning the image: cleanedImage = DeleteSmallComponents[RemoveBackground[img]] Then we extract the bounding boxes: boundingBoxes = ComponentMeasurements[cleanedImage, "BoundingBox"] Finally, I use a rule replacement to apply `ImageTrim` -- another approach could also be used. boundingBoxes /. (Rule[n_, size_] :&gt; Rule[n, ImageTrim[cleanedImage, size]]) The final code is ``` cleanedImage = DeleteSmallComponents[RemoveBackground[img]]; boundingBoxes = ComponentMeasurements[cleanedImage, "BoundingBox"] boundingBoxes /. (Rule[n_, size_] :&gt; Rule[n, ImageTrim[cleanedImage, size]]) ```
This works like a charm! This is exactly what I needed, thanks!
It is a matter of plotting range. The values are too high in the white region and Mathematica decides to cut them off. You can adjust this threshold with the option `PlotRange`, as show in the documentation page of `ContourPlot` (`Examples -&gt; Options -&gt; PlotRange`).
It worked! Thank you very much.
One thing that I would suggest: add pattern checks to all arguments of all functions. This is a very basic and very important practice. You use them anyway from time to time, so why not cover everything? 
You are quite right in both cases. I will make the changes when I update the document. 
I've finished reading your notes, and it was very interesting. I have a similar experience as the target audience of your work: studying functional and array programming with Mathematica coming from the OOP background (not Java though). And I find your approach very educational. Helped me to systematize ideas about switching from procedural/imperative/OOP languages to Mathematica. It was a bit painful to see multiple Map's instead of /@ and lack of @@ and @@@ sometimes :-) But I understand that this is a much better approach for an educational document, abuse of special symbols would scare out everyone. At a few points, you still succumbed to temptation and used overly dense one-liners --- almost impossible to resist these things with Mathematica xD Another idea I wanted to share. When I help or try to help people to learn Mathematica I notice that one of the largest obstacles they face is a non-obvious change of program state when working with a notebook. Like "I launched some code, got some results. Then I launched it again and got something else. Fuck Mathematica, it's stupid". Of course, the reason is a poor understanding of = and :=. But it is a very hard topic to master for a new user. So, I think it is a very good idea to advice new users to use Clear/ClearAll all the time. Maybe you may introduce this in your notes. Overall, thanks a lot for a very good work and for sharing it with the community! The hand of a professional educator is obvious throughout the notebook. If I had these materials a few years ago in college when I was starting to learn Mathematica, it would be so much easier. I completely agree with your motivation in the introduction, this kind of materials is lacking. 
Firstly your equation isn't notated right for reddit. Can you fix that?
Sorry, First time posting here. I tried to make it more readable. If you find something missing please tell me.
Four spaces before each line of code. 
I don't believe it. It worked. Thanks for replying so fast!
The way to spot this error is by paying attention to the colour of the text, as the blue shows Mathematica has no definition stored for that variable
Another improvement: instead of putting {Re[foo], Im[foo]}, just put ReIm[foo]
This is the most important comment. My students always seem to ignore \(or not notice?\) the coloring that Mathematica uses to help with debugging.
Neat
Indeed. It's taught me a lot about computer algebra and programming language design.
Hah, I have never seen this one before! I think I already have muscle memory for {Re@#,Im@#}&amp;/@.
&gt;I did some more editing to the document, but the paragraph about using ClearAll did not really have a natural place anywhere in it. But that document does not try to be comprehensive language reference anyway, but demonstrate the language in action for solving real problems. Yeah, I completely understand. It's just that I see a lot of people turning away for Mathematica because of these side effect problems they face, and it wouldn't be a problem for them if they always used ClearAll. Your projects look very fun! And the pieces of art, well some of them just WOAH. These 48, OMG. This is sooo cool. As soon as I'm done with work today, going to check the code. 54 is also very impressive. I have zero ideas how you manage to do these things. Your students are very lucky to have such a passionate professor. 
Papers for what, precisely? Publications, or simply to hand in for coursework?
Publication. I've been given a Word template with extensive use of styles and table formatting that I'm expected to use as my starting point. Searching "publication ready Mathematica" I seem to have stumbled into a Mathematica / Latex / Office religious war, example here: [https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/684132/latex\-tex\-vs\-mathematica\-for\-typesetting/](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/684132/latex-tex-vs-mathematica-for-typesetting/) Let's say I want to take up the Mathematica religion, and I want to know how to faithful get their formatting done. For example do they 1\) become stylesheet masters or 2\) use TeXFragment everywhere to make little chunks of EPS that get reinserted into their notebook or 3\) use HTMLFragment? Of all the ways I can make pretty and complex tables in Mathematica, I want to know which method "normal people" use.
Can I ask why you're using Mathematica over Latex/Word specifically?
The suggestion to use TableForm\[\] is a winner. The CDF Info Kit and the Mathematica Journal are also treasure troves of information. [http://www.wolfram.com/cdf/information\-kit/content/index.html](http://www.wolfram.com/cdf/information-kit/content/index.html) [http://www.mathematica\-journal.com/](http://www.mathematica-journal.com/)
You‚Äôre pretty close with that. The head on x^2 is x^2[[0]]==Power, so that‚Äôs the head your need to replace. x^2 /. Power-&gt;Subscript (* x_2 *)
well this is embarassing because i suck at coding but I hope you can decipher something out https://pastebin.com/RquUcVF5 http://puu.sh/AeNt4/99b87f3bda.png
Post the code, not a screenshot of the code.
This code is not working. Don't waste our time. 
There is a pastebin...
Increase PlotPoints.
Maybe you could also try to test your code first because it is still not working.
I literally gave you the fixed pastebin
Third times a charm, i hate the fact that variables coexist amongs all cells in this software... Still getting used to that https://pastebin.com/GFebK9WC
Thanks the video is useful. Does anyone know the deal with the Mathematica RasPi license and academic research? I saw that the license prohibits commercial use, but what about non-commercial academic research?
Directly, just increase PlotPoints. But if you want a really smooth boundary surface, it is not how DensityPlot3D works. It uses a 3D greed. If you want to refine this, you'll need to extract all edge points and substitute them with an interpolating surface. 
I already know that, but thanks. I *need* to find a way to do it without RowReduce; it's an assignment. I just need a way to generalize the first line of code to any row, but I'm not sure how to use the For command properly... If I find out how to that then I can do the rest of it.
After a couple minutes of messing around, i came up with: For[i = 1, i &lt; Dimensions[A][[1]] + 1, i++, Print[ For[j = 1, j &lt; Dimensions[A][[1]] + 1, j++, Print[A[[j, i]]/A[[1, i]]] ] ] ] Which at least will iterate over both rows and columns, but wont work if the first element of a column is zero or give the output in matrix form, but hopefully it helps.
I actually need help with what to type into mathimatica to get the shape to rotate around the x axis. It‚Äôs my first time using mathimatica sorry 
RevolutionAxis-&gt;{1,0,0}, as it says on your example, not {2,0,0}.
Thanks for the reply , I tried that but it kept showing the error, ended up just submitting it 
Oh I forgot... Geodesate is a "Needs" thing. (needs PolyhedronOperations oe something like that - I am Not in my Computer reicht now) I actually found some Kind of workaround. I created a mesh in blender (an icosphere is the same as an icosahedron that is geodesated). I deleted only the faces of the mesh in blender and exported it as obj. (maybe I go of leave them in and let mathematics deal with that, but in the obj file edges are only saved if I delete the faces). I imported it into mathematica and extracted the linedata - (iirc) it is all the pairs of vertices that form an edge. I manually constructed edges out of these number pairs and created a mathematica graph. I got the adjacency matrix from the graph. So I will be able to construct the Laplace Matrix from it and the diagonal matrix with the node degrees (easy to construct). Of course I will have to move this into my python code for the gray-scott thing gain and then visualize the whole thing... Should only take forever xD So it works - kinda. It's not really elegant right now. And I still would like to know, if it's possible to convert geodesated objects in mathematics into meshes somehow or at least extract vertex and edge data (and face data) from it.
&amp;&amp; means "and" in a logical test. # means a "slot" representing the first argument to a function, and &amp; means "this is a function". For example, #^2&amp; is a function that squares whatever it's applied to. === means "identical to", and is always evaluated to True or False (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5286736/difference-between-and-in-mathematica). I've found that for string comparisons it's often a bit safer, but == might have worked, too. So, in this case, the logical function used to test each entry in list to see if it's Select'ed is #[[1]]==="FORD"&amp;&amp;#[[4]]==1 &amp; i.e., for each thing # this is applied to, we check if the first entry (ie, #[[1]]) is "FORD" and (ie, &amp;&amp;) if the 4th entry (ie, #[[4]]) is 1, and make it a function (ie, &amp; at the end)
When you define a function, be sure to append an underscore to each argument: u[x_] := a1 Sin[x] + a2 Sin[2 x] Once you have defined u\[x\_\], you can get its derivative with u'\[x\]; there't no need to define du\[x\]. Defining it is awkward because the D function is a little odd. With your definition \(D\[u\[x\],x\]\), it fails if the argument isn't a symbol: du[3] ... 3 is not a valid variable This seems to work \(though I'm not an expert, so there may be a better way to do this\): du[x_]:=D[u[y],y]/.y-&gt;x When using the functions like du\[\] later, you need to provide the argument: U[x_] := .5*NIntegrate[du[x]^2, {x, 0, 10}] sin needs to be capitalized: W[x_] := NIntegrate[u[x]*Sin[3 x], {x, 0, 10}] What are U\[\] and W\[\] supposed to do with x? It is passed in as an argument, but then it's overridden by using x as the parameter of integration. They both use NIntegrate, which fails because it is supposed to do a numeric calculation rather than symbolic, and a1 and a2 aren't defined. Integrate\[\] might be what you want.
I sent you a message. There are a couple things wrong here. NIntegrate can't do symbolic evaluation - thats what the N (numerical) means. So having a1 and a2 as free variables, makes it necessary to use Integrate instead. Additionally, there is a difference between a function, and evaluating the function. u is different from u[x]. I fixed the issues and ran the code. Worked just fine. In[25]:= u[x] := a1 Sin[x] + a2 Sin[2 x] du[x] := D[u[x], x] U[x] := .5*Integrate[du[x]^2, {x, 0, 10}] W[x] := Integrate[u[x]*Sin[3 x], {x, 0, 10}] PE[x] := U[x] - W[x] dPEa1[x] := D[PE[x], a1] dPEa2[x] := D[PE[x], a2] Solve[{dPEa1[x] == 0, dPEa2[x] == 0}, {a1, a2}] Out[32]= {{a1 -&gt; 0.0239965, a2 -&gt; -0.0110352}}
You are right in saying that the solution is not unique, but I think that it is important to specify the behaviour of the program in such cases, and it is indeed: &gt; When no boundary condition is specified on a part of the boundary ‚àÇŒ©, then the flux term ‚àá¬∑(-c ‚àáu-Œ± u+Œ≥)+‚Ä¶ over that part is taken to be f=f+0=f+NeumannValue[0,‚Ä¶], so not specifying a boundary condition at all is equivalent to specifying a Neumann 0 condition. http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/NeumannValue.html
I think it is because you are calling `f2[t]` with `t`, which becomes `Convolve[f[t], f[t], t, t]`, which is 1. You can fix it by defining `f4` as `Convolve[f2[y], f2[y], y, x]`.
Thank you Mathematica Guardian Angel! Do you know why they decided anonymous/pure functions need to end with an "&amp;"? It seems odd to me without knowing the reason.
Not a stupid question at all! It's a small sub and i'm not sure how many people here know how to help (I don't, with this). You should definitely check out the mathematica stackexchange; I imagine that you could get some solid help with this there.
Thanks. I'll definitely look at that.

It's not exactly the method you're envisioning, but you can do something like this by playing with the color function in Plot3D Plot3D[y, {x, 0, 3}, {y, 0, 3}, ColorFunction -&gt; Function[{x, y, z}, Hue[x, 1, y]], ViewPoint -&gt; {0, 0, Infinity}, BoundaryStyle -&gt; None, Axes -&gt; False, Boxed -&gt; False, MeshStyle -&gt; None] If using the image is critical to your application, I can try to come up with something that uses it, but this is a little simpler and will work in most cases
Ah wait this isn't exactly what you wanted. I'll try to make it better later
It's more like using something like this [gradient picture](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1111/WAC_CSHADE_O000N1800_1000.jpg) to convert the image into a matrix in such a way depending on the color a value from 0 to 1 would be applied, so you can use ListPLot3D to makes a graph that makes a height map depending on the color.
So you have a set of values and want to know which ones are 1? Sounds like Position is the function you want: vals=RandomChoice[{0,1},{28,8,512] pts= Position[vals, 1] ListPlot3D[pts]
I am not able to copy it or find any OCR that can convert it into a copy-pastable text. Can anyone do it for me, please?
` f[x_]:=Sum[Sin[2*Pi*x/6]*Sin[n*Pi*x/6],{n,1,300}]; Integrate[f[x],{x,0,6}] ` Hope this helps (and is formatted correctly)!
Cool, glad to have helped.
Thanks man. It worked well
It should still work, so long as you load combinatorica into your notebook first, i.e. &lt;&lt;Combinatorica` TransitiveQ[...]
I did that and it turns red and doesn't output anything.
If it turns red it is because you have already used the function name in that session before you loaded the package. Quit the kernel and try again, loading the package first.
Still doesn't work loading the package outputs this: &gt; General::compat: Combinatorica Graph and Permutations functionality has been superseded by preloaded functionality. The package now being loaded may conflict with this. Please see the Compatibility Guide for details. and then when I run TransativeQ it simply outputs TransativeQ unevaluated.
Works for me on TransitiveQ[CompleteGraph[5]]. Your last message has the function spelt wrong. You shouldn't really be using the Combinatorica functions any more though. Have you looked at [IGraphM]?(https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/143842/how-find-out-whether-a-graph-is-vertex-transitive)? 
I might end up using the method shown in the link you sent. The example you gave works. I think the problem is that TransitiveQ still uses an old form of the graph object. So I would have to convert the current graph object into the old one.
That was not what i meant but i figured it out. Thank you
It's possible, but very, very far from easy. You're best bet is to make sure you use a SparseArray, and maybe try different methods for LinearSolve. Some work better than others for different kinds of matrices. I've never imported Cuda functions into Mathematica, but from what I remember it is possible. It's not clear exactly how to go about it, but i perused the documentation and I'm sure if you spend an hour or two messing with it, you should be able to get it down.
Yeah, I worked out a way to make it faster using sparse arrays that I didn't "normal", as well as finding a decently fast solving method, got my n up to 5000 with some waiting time I spent a few hours with cuda, too, but didn't get cudas linear solver implemented 
Thank you so much. It helped a lot!
You can indeed! It really depends on your use case which approach is best, but the most common method is to use associations. There are also add-on libraries that allow more traditional types.I highly recommend MTools https://github.com/faysou/MTools All the above comes with a bit of a caveat, OOP in Mathematica is probably its greatest weakness. One day hopefully they'll do more with regards to it, but for now we have workable although not great solutions.
Thanks a lot
Mathematica is a Turing-complete language with the possibility to create types (sort of), so it is possible. Is this a good idea? No, absolutely not in 99% of cases. And never for a person without serious experience. &gt;Or is there any alternative way I can do this in Mathematica From your brief description, it seems that you don't even need OOP, just a flexible container. Association or Dataset will suit you, I believe. 
It is not even clear what are you trying to solve. Reformulate your problem for a case of 1-2 equations with very clear notation and describtion. 
Hi guys, I need some help to solve an Homogeneous system with a repeated EigenValue using Wolfram Mathematica. Here's the photo of my "code". I keep getting the "False" message at the end of it and don't really know what I did wrong. Any help would be Great. Thanks! 
ShareX and/or github gist
I see a few things wrong, which include that line where you try to define your eigenvalues and eigenvectors. I'm not sure what order you actually tried to run these commands in, since I don't see an error there. Also, small thing, the number is E and not e.
I couldn't decide which episode to watch, so I made a robot do it for me. I coded up a random episode generator in Mathematica. It gives a separate window so that you can minimize the notebook, and just have the button and the window with the episodes. I posted the notebook to my website *Science for the Busy* [here](https://sites.google.com/view/science-for-the-busy/mathematica) at the bottom in the *Not important stuff* folder. I can also just post the code itself. Clear[Futurama, epnames] epnames[S_] := epnames[S] = WolframAlpha[ "Futurama season" &lt;&gt; ToString@S, {{"SeasonEpisodes:TelevisionProgramData", 1}, "ComputableData"}, PodStates -&gt; {"SeasonEpisodes:TelevisionProgramData__More", "SeasonEpisodes:TelevisionProgramData__More"}][[2 ;;, 1]] Futurama := Block[ (*This uses this sequencing http://epguides.com/Futurama/*) {S = RandomInteger[{1, 7}], ep}, ep = RandomInteger[{1, {9, 20, 15, 12, 16, 26, 26}[[S]]}]; "Season: " &lt;&gt; ToString@S &lt;&gt; ", Episode: " &lt;&gt; ToString@ep &lt;&gt; ", Name: " &lt;&gt; epnames[S][[ep]] ] CreateDialog[ Button["Give me a random Futurama episode to watch", Print@Futurama, Alignment -&gt; Center], WindowTitle -&gt; "Which episode of Futurama you should watch" ]
Very cool! Few comments: your random selection is strongly biased towards episodes from smaller seasons (IDK whether it's intended). And each click on the button is followed by connection to the Wolfram alpha which is not generally a good idea. Here's my take using parsing of a wiki page: dat = Cases[ Import["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Futurama_episodes", "Data"], {_Integer}~Join~ConstantArray[_, 7], \[Infinity]]; parsedDat = ToExpression[StringSplit[#[[-2]], _?LetterQ ..]]~ Join~{StringTrim[#[[3]], ("\" " | " \"")]} &amp; /@ dat; randomEpisode[] := StringForm["Season: `` Epsiode: `` Name: ``", Sequence @@ RandomChoice[parsedDat]];
Thanks for the feedback! I tried to minimize the WA-connections by memoizing the episode names for each season (I couldn't get it to give all the episode names in one go). This way it would only connect a maximum of 7 times, since there are 7 seasons. While I tried using the WikipediaData function, it gave everything except the data tables; but that's not a problem using your Importing of the Wikipedia List. Also, it looks like having the length restriction in the cases actually excludes the last two seasons because the data tables have 9 columns as opposed to the rest of them having 8. Though, we can change it to Alternatives @@ ({_Integer}~Join~ConstantArray[_, #] &amp; /@ {7, 8}) Then this new list has sublists whose -2 or -3 elements is the season and episode number we want, so we can just change your part specification in the StringSplit to StringSplit[#[[If[Length@# == 8, -2, -3]]], _?LetterQ ..] where we can use the simple If statement because our only two lists are either length 8 or 9. And voila! All in all, I really appreciate the redo! It's a lot cleaner, only scrapes the info once, and uses some, at least to me, slick code!
&gt; WikipediaData function, it gave everything except the data table This function is actually terribly bugged, at least on my 11.2. I wouldn't recommend even touching it before they fix it heavily. &gt;Also, it looks like having the length restriction in the cases actually excludes the last two seasons because the data tables have 9 columns as opposed to the rest of them having 8. Yeah, that's the downside of manual parsing. I wonder if there a better way to extract tables than Cases.
30 years is enough time add a linear ordering to the manual pages, implement a bug-tracker, design an editor to work with the user instead of against him. Open-source is going to sink this company, better translate your notebooks to Sage Math while you're still able to even open them.
Ah, it's you again. Still toying around with a product you obviously hate? Don't feed the troll, people. 
I am literally going line by line through all my mathematica notebooks and translating them into Sage notebooks.
lmao
I love this guy. I miss him.
Code runs just fine for me.
Runs fine for me. Download more RAM maybe.
So what company do you work for that you spend so much time shitting on competition?
^ Ad hominem attack from a sycophant who can't handle the facts about Mathematica. This is why the shit will still be crashing in another 10 years. Wolfram has enough of these thank-you-sir-may-I-have-another queers riding his dick.
Take a look at "q" before plotting it. Looks like Mathematica isn't able to solve that differential equation. Also, make sure to capitalize "sin" and use square brackets around its argument: sin(a\*t) -&gt; Sin\[a\*t\] In[7] = q := DSolve[{y''[t] + 2*gamma*y'[t] + omega^2*(1 + 2*epsilon*Sin[a*t])*y[t] == 0, y[0] == 1, y'[0] == 1}, y[t], t] In[8] = q Out[8] = DSolve[{(1 + 0.02 Sin[2 t]) y[t] + 0.04 y'[t] + y''[t]==0, y[0]==1, y'[0]==1}, y[t], t]
Thanks for taking the time to answer. I capitalized it, and nothing changed, before and after mathematica did solve it and gave me the following solution : {{y[t] -&gt; ( 1.40834 E^(-0.1 t) (-44.1203 AiryAi[-((0.0341995 Sin t)/(-Sin)^( 2/3))] + 1. (-1. Sin)^(1/3) AiryAi[-((0.0341995 Sin t)/(-Sin)^(2/3))] + 25.4729 AiryBi[-((0.0341995 Sin t)/(-Sin)^(2/3))] + 0.57735 (-1. Sin)^(1/3) AiryBi[-((0.0341995 Sin t)/(-Sin)^(2/3))]))/( 4.66879*10^-16 + 1. (-1. Sin)^(1/3))}}
So how exactly does that program use the *Mathematica* software, developed by Wolfram Research Inc.? Please note that this subreddit is for Mathematic**a**, not Mathematic**s**.
Thank you for comment. I'm newcomer in reddit. Can I move this post to the Mathematics, or I need write it again?
You will have to delete this post and post it again on /r/math .
Try to at least carefully read what they told you. 
Please specify. Do you want to make an animation of small objects moving on edges of a planar graph? 
&gt;Suppose I have a Cartesian or Polar math function; how do I then convert that into a NURBS curve? Discretize the curve, then BSplineCurve. &gt;How do I tell if it's an exact fit, or, if it is limited to being an approximation Calculate some norm of a difference. &gt;how do I constrain that approximation? Increase discritization and interpolation parameters, such as degree, etc. 
Yeah, specifically the objects are packets with a specified destination. 
Here's an example: Animate[ ef[pts_List, e_] := Block[{s = 0.015, g = Graphics[{{Hue[(e[[1]] + e[[2]])/6], Disk[{0, 0}, 1]}}]}, {Arrowheads[{{s, z/e[[1]], g}}], Arrow[pts]}]; Graph[{1 \[UndirectedEdge] 2, 2 \[UndirectedEdge] 3, 3 \[UndirectedEdge] 1}, EdgeShapeFunction -&gt; ef], {z, 0, 1}]
What happens if you go to Format -&gt; Stylesheet -&gt; Default
That fixed it, thank you! Any idea how this might have happened? I know I didn't navigate to the menu and change the style, so I must have hit a keyboard shortcut or something?
¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Thanks! I‚Äôll try that out and get back to you. 
It says that an "unknown box name (List) was sent as the boxForm for the expression. Check format rules for expression"
I double-checked, it works. Mathematica 11.3 on windows-64. If you have an older version, I recommend updating. 
I don't want to discretize the curve; I want it either completely symbolically converted, or chopped into as few piecewise function approximations that lie within my intended constraints.
&gt;I want it either completely symbolically converted NURBS can exactly fit only a zero-measure set of curves. &gt;or chopped into as few piecewise function approximations that lie within my intended constraints You better give full mathematical details then. 
How about we start with an arbitrary conic section, since NURBS are perfectly capable of producing those? How is such a conversion done?
I'm not that good with linear algebra, but it seems like this only has a trivial solution. With a row x and matrix A, x A = 0 has a nonzero solution if and only if A is singular, and A is singular if and only if the determinant is 0. The determinant of this is Œ≤\^5 \* 2(.618\^2 - .618\^4), so it will be singular if and only if Œ≤=0. But if Œ≤=0, the matrix will be all zeros.
Thank your very much, seems like there is no clear solution. 
In case you are interested, I found a solution for the problem according to this [paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed072pA120). The [solution](https://imgur.com/a/QNhw4Oq), first I had to go back to the H√ºckel matrix by dividing the secular matrix with Œ≤ and and replacing (Œ±-Œµ)/Œ≤ with x. Then as usually I have to find the energy values of the molecular orbitals by setting the determinant of the H√ºckel matrix equal to zero. Then I have to set x equal to the energies of the molecular orbitals. With the function "Eigensystem" Mathematica calculates a eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue near zero. So I can read out the coefficients from the eigenvector which has an eigenvalue near zero. Only problem is that I have to normalize the first eigenvector to get c1=c2=c3=c4=c5=5^(-0.5). But still wondering why Mathematica can't find these solutions on the more obvious way :/.
Should be pretty simple. Assuming you don't have to strip any headers, using Import[] will load your data into an array that you can plot directly using any of the [built in functions](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/PlottingListsOfData.html). [Quick example for a 20x20 array](https://imgur.com/a/AEuUyxq). From there it's a matter of formatting, and maybe trimming the data - depending on how big it is, you might have a difficult time working with that large of a dataset (plus you're limited by the resolution of your image anyway....)

Thank you. I basically just copied the code in your image (changing the file name). It has been stuck with a little window it opened with the message "Formatting Notebook Contents" for a few minutes now. Should I just wait? Is this just because of the stupidly large size of my Excel worksheet?
I got a ton of errors. https://i.imgur.com/MvEoTTE.png Strangely the screenshot didn't capture it, but it also says "The specified setting for the option Graphics3DBoxOptions, PlotRange cannot be used." As I said, I exactly copied your code in your image, with the exception of the excel sheet title.
Yup! It's because it's trying to display your full tabular data array - put a semicolon after the import so that it doesn't and you'll be good.
For one, get rid of all but one of the plot options, it'll just make things longer to try to plot things multiple times. Mathematica seems to be able to handle[ missing values and uneven lengths](https://imgur.com/a/JPwr6os) just fine, as well as [non-integer values](https://imgur.com/a/IWOVWF2), so the problem's likely on the import side. If you just copied my code verbatim, it won't work - it assumes the excel document is in the same location as where you saved your mathematica notebook (that's what my first line is doing), but you haven't actually saved yours. I'd suggest making a new folder, putting the excel sheet in there, saving a new notebook, and giving it another go. Using a simplified excel doc with only a handful of values will make your life a lot easier when troubleshooting as well.

That didn't work... :/ Mathematica is displaying a little bit of the data from Excel, so I know that's not the problem. I'm wondering if maybe this is too much data for even Mathematica to handle.
Ok so let me get this straight, the format of your csv is: , y1, y2, y3 x1,f11,f12,f13 x2,f21,f22,f23 x3,f31,f32,f33 And you want to 3D plot f(x,y)? Would you mind showing a screenshot of your excel file?
Here's a small randomly selected sample of the data. https://i.imgur.com/WSYOuEX.png They are all integers. The smallest number is 0, and the biggest is whatever that max value Excel can handle is (I can't remember, and I don't care to look through all the data to find it). It's a huge range of data covering tens of thousands of cells.
What does the upper left corner look like? What‚Äôs the structure of the data? Also, why are there such obscene exponents in the data? Do you want to take the log?
The upper leftmost corner consists of small numbers, but they start to get big after about a dozen or so cells in any direction. That's just the data - I didn't choose for them to be that big. I have nothing against taking the log. I just want to express the data as a 3D graph &lt;values, row, column&gt;.
Are you sure you don‚Äôt mean &lt;row,column,value&gt;? ListPlot3D[Table[{i,j,#[[i,j]](*change this order if i‚Äôm Wrong*)},{i,Length@First@#},{j,Length@#}],PlotRange-&gt;All]&amp;@Import[‚Äúfile.csv‚Äù(*just drag and drop it here and it will take care of it for you*),‚ÄùTable‚Äù] Should do it. I‚Äôm just on my phone though. Post results. 
The order doesn't really matter. [This](https://i.imgur.com/OJvWw1A.png) is what happened. 
Looks like a problem with my phones quote marks not behaving like native ones. Try overwriting the quotes with your quotes. Like put your cursor after the quote symbols, hit backspace, and then write your own. The coloration should be grey. Also, like my comment states, erase ‚Äúdata.xslx‚Äù and Make it your file (‚ÄúC:/path/to/file.xlsx‚Äù)
Okay, I'm heading to bed, but I'll try that tomorrow and give you an update. Thank you. I actually copied my data and made "Data.xlsx" because the original title gave away some information I wasn't looking to share, and I didn't want to rename it.
Alternatively if you just used a function to generate data you can plot that. 
Believe me, that was the first thing I tried. I'm terrible at coding, and even after an hour of research I couldn't figure out how to generate the data in Mathematica, and I can't very well ask for help doing that due to the nature of the data.
Try running `Tuples[Range@10^6,10^6];` first, that should fix it. 
Thanks, but I don't need to, because Python / Sage / Axiom do it better.
We can test this out by importing only a fraction of your data. [Here's an example that's managed to be both over-engineered and half-assed](https://imgur.com/a/98HQHhA). This will go through and import every *nth* cell, where *n* is given by *iterator*. Change this to some large value dependent on how many cells there are (for instance, if there's 300k columns and 500k rows, using 20000 will give you a 15x25 dataset). Assuming this works, then it is indeed a problem with the amount of data - which wouldn't be too surprising if your values are truly 100+ digits long each. You can then start dropping iterator down and seeing how much it can handle. If you're not familiar, I've got two parts commented out (anything encased in (\* \*) won't evaluate) for different options, depending on what's the more preferable 'approximation' of your data. The first one simply generates an array of data by plucking out values at the precribed interval. The second pulls out the same values, but leaves them in their original spot in the array, with the rest being 'blank'. [Here's a visualization of what this would look like](https://imgur.com/a/IZyBuv7) - top is the original/full data, the middle is what you get from the first option, and the bottom from the second. Pick the one you like, delete the encasing comment marks, and leave the other one as is. **Don't** run any code from the second image of the first link - that's just an example showing the difference.

I will definitely try this out later. I've been extra busy today, so I've not had a chance to work on this at all.
Your data looks regular so start with about one percent of that to do the calculations more quickly. data = Table[{x, MoonPhase[FromUnixTime[x]]}, {x, 0, 15311808, 86400}] ListPlot[data] That really looks like 1/2-1/2 Sin[c x] and, because your coefficients are so large, we need some good starting estimate for c. By coincidence that one percent of the data just happens to complete about six cycles of the sine wave. That lets us estimate that the function is close to 1/2-1/2 Sin[1/403166 x] and Show[ListPlot[data], Plot[1/2 (1 - Sin[1/403166 x]), {x, 0, 15292800}]] demonstrates the estimate seems pretty good. Next we try to more accurately find that coefficient using FindFit FindFit[data, 1/2 (1 - Sin[c x]), {{c, 1/403166}}, x] which returns c -&gt; 2.474*10^-6 and Show[ListPlot[Take[alldata, 1000]], Plot[1/2 (1 - Sin[2.47418*^-6 x]), {x, 0, 7*15292800}]] shows this seems to be a reasonable and simple estimate. Use more data points and perhaps more precision if you want a better estimate
Building off what the other guy said (mostly because I was most of the way through writing this when I saw he responded lol) - You're making the program work too hard. For one, you already mentioned the data's periodic, so calculating 17k+ data points is wayyyy overkill. You know the periodicity's about 1 month, so doing a year will be [plenty good](https://imgur.com/a/g3yj1qj): data2 = Table[{x, MoonPhase[FromUnixTime[x]]}, {x, 0, 365*24*3600, 86400}] As with all curve fitting, how well you can initialize things will really make or break how much success you have. Without any help, FindFormula[] is going to start simple and work outwards. In this case, y=0.500472 actually approximates the data reasonably well ('well' being a relative term....). FindFit[] gives you more control, and thus will likely give you a more robust fit in most cases. We want to specify a generalized Sin function: FindFit[data2,a+b*Sin[2*Pi*(x-d)/c],{a,b,c,d},x] Running this gives a result that [fails spectacularly](https://imgur.com/a/ekIRH9k). The problem is that it's starting guess (1.000 for all) seems to have mathematically 'converged' quickly, even though its clearly quite off. So, let's be smarter - let's give it a decent starting spot. It runs from 0 to 1, so a and b would naturally be assigned 0.5. We know a lunar cycle is about 4 weeks, so we can set that as the frequency of our oscillation. Finally, the sin curve appears to begin around 1.1E6. FindFit[data2,a+b*Sin[2*Pi*(x-d)/c],{{a,0.5},{b,0.5},{c,28*24*3600},{d,1*10^6}},x] This is [dramatically improved](https://imgur.com/a/VHrf1wX). (note that the fit returned a negative sin, vs the half cycle phase shift that we used). We can now [build a function that returns the lunar phase for a given unix time](https://imgur.com/a/Pfrll6H); we can use [other units/systems depending on how we setup the argument](https://imgur.com/a/pPHEBq5).

It‚Äôs a joke. If you run that it will crash the kernel for sure. 
Well, this code works, but it seems my data is just too big. There doesn't seem to be an n I can enter that really works. Oh well. I'll have to find a non-Mathematica option.
So, as you were saying?
Try Octave or even Numpy/Pandas. What I will say is that I've never been in a situation where Mathematica can't handle the data and something else can given my hardware. How big is your dataset? I've coped just fine with a table about two hundred thousand rows and sixty columns and I don't even notice it. I've used even far larger spreadsheets. Also what is good to remember is that Import[] automatically tries to figure out what columns are and convert into an internal type. If you specify it might help. It's also worth mentioning that if you do get it Imported then you should save a copy to whatever Mathematica prefers as a data store. How much ram do you have? Also, try save the doc as .csv then import. 
I haven't really run into many excel files that Mathematica can't handle. What does `FileByteCount` say about the size of your file?
Where do I find that?
Open up a Mathematica notebook and type in `FileByteCount[ filename ]` where `filename` is the path to your excel file
Okay, I'll do so later. I'm a but busy at the moment.
Lists and recursion.
What do you mean by ‚ÄúOnly on Mathematica code itself‚Äù.
Hi! We would like to have the sieve in Mathematica, without using any built-in functions, such as Prime(). Thanks!
Ok, but where is the problem then? Mathematica supports most of the programming constructs "real" programming languages have: You can use For loops, If conditions, check for equality using == and treat Lists like Arrays. It might not result in the the most beautiful, Mathematica-esque or efficient code, but it should be fairly easy to program a Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm using these basic building blocks. (A more advanced user might of course take advantage of more complicated Mathematica constructs, but this should be the easiest way for a Newbie to complete this task).
Thank you!
The % in your last line corresponds to the previous output, which is Null (that's the output of SetDelayed)
Just to be clear, this response is after over a full week of waiting for vakula to respond after giving the required clarification... So were you ever really going to answer the question, or were you just answer-blocking me by posing as someone capable of answering the question, leaving others capable of answering it assuming it was covered?
You're a funny guy. So, OK, let's get clear. Yes, I was going to answer, I even did answer your question to the extent its initial formulation allowed. Moreover, I'm still capable of proceeding. The problem is, after seeing your attitude towards someone who is for no reason but being nice is helping you expressed by "How about we start with..." , I lost any interest in doing so. &gt;were you just answer-blocking me by posing as someone capable of answering the question Yeah, that's my fucking hobby. Answer-blocking people. You have a very rich imagination. And a piece of advice for you: if you want to get help on such topics online, shift your concerns from people "answer-blocking" you towards trying to actually formulate what you want specifically. 
Oh, thanks, it did work. I removed the % symbol and Null is gone. What about brackets though?
Here's my thought, by the way. Write the code for the Sieve using all of the high-level functionality that you want. Any functions that you find objectionable (such as `Prime[]`) feel free to re-write these functions on your own (for instance, reimplement `Prime[]` as `myPrime[]` with the functionality you need). That way you can still write the high-level code, *and* learn the underlying mathematics/coding. And just as an aside, as the above user said, your code with not be very "Mathematica-y" if you are wanting to insist on using `List`s like arrays, and using `For` loops, etc. But for this exercise it shouldn't matter so much. GOOD LUCK!
Nevermind! I found a solution that doesn't even require a package. function = Log[10, a x + b /. a -&gt; 1]; Plot3D[function, {x, 1, 3}, {b, 1, 3}, ScalingFunctions -&gt; {Identity, Identity, "Log"}]
There was nothing vague about my question. NURBS are capable of expressing a very broad variety of mathematical curves exactly. Resorting to discretizing curves in those cases is not only unnecessary, but counterproductive in a tool designed for solving problems symbolically. Since NURBS are just another way of expressing the exact same shapes, there's nothing to clarify about converting a simple math function to a NURBS curve. Since you clearly don't get that, you were clearly never capable of answering my question to begin with, and are obviously just resorting to the trolling you do on other subredits. If you were ever really capable of answering the question, you would have done so as immediately as you responded to my criticism of your lack of response. Instead, after giving the only clarification that was necessary, and throwing you a softball of a problem to demonstrate a solution with, you instead decided to wait for me to get frustrated with your lack of response, so you could launch a completely unfounded attack. While I may be in error, and would certainly appreciate an answer to my question as a means of demonstrating that fact, your track record on other subredits appears to speak for itself.
You can also do {#1,#2,Log10@#3}&amp;@@&amp;/@(data) and that will take the Log10 of the third ‚Äòcolumn‚Äô.
Good to know! Thanks!
&gt;There was nothing vague about my question. NURBS are capable of expressing a very broad variety of mathematical curves exactly. Maybe in your mathematically illiterate world, there's nothing vague about it. Because now it is apparent that you just assume that there's **a purely analytical algorithm** of "converting" (whatever it means) any function (or some "broad variety" whatever it means in engineer's measure theory) to NURBS, such that it coincides for **all** possible function with an exact (one of infinity possible ones in many cases) representations. Well, bad news. There're obviously no such algorithms. It's, of course, possible and quite simple to get the results for conical sections by employing ad hoc methods, but that's it. &gt;If you were ever really capable of answering the question, you would have done so as immediately as you responded to my criticism of your lack of response. &gt;for me to get frustrated with your lack of response Oh, you really feel entitled to get free help from people on the internet. Funny. And, yeah, I would probably answer if this attitude wasn't so apparent. Good thing you're bad at hiding it. &gt;your track record on other subredits appears to speak for itself. You can scroll more, Mr. Detective, and find that I did actually provide pieces of relevant code to people who didn't act like assholes.
No, not ‚Äúall possible functions‚Äù, just a broad variety of them sufficient to be useful for engineering purposes, as demonstrated by many top-shelf CAD packages. A sufficiently well-versed mathematician would be able to show how to symbollically solve for the NURBS constants given a (frequently, but not always) valid equivalence to an existing geometric function. The fact that you don‚Äôt understand this, and are jumping to conclusions about the problem being ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù, as opposed to merely ‚Äúobfuscated by the assumption that the available material is only relevant to a topically-specific audience‚Äù is further proof that you were always too ignorant to have ever been capable of answering the question at all. And, worse, you now openly admit that you had no such answer to give, and were just jerking me around. I look forward to you having a learning experience when my question is finally answered priperly; but, then, people like you go to great lengths to avoid learning, so you can remain ignorant enough to foist your invalid assumptions on others, don‚Äôt you? Anyone who reads your posts will see that, of your own volition, you choose to attack rather than help. Trolling behavior demonstrably outweighs any useful or constructive comments you may have. Please, if you don‚Äôt have any math relevant to my question to contribute, get the hell out of my thread. Your determination to cover for your ignorance with vitriol isn‚Äôt helping either one of us.
This post strikes me as a bit impolite. This is reddit -- /u/vakula doesn't have any responsibility to follow up on any of his comments. He tried to be helpful, gave some good-faith advice that didn't resolve the problem, and then didn't continue to engage when asked for additional help. That's basically par for the course for reddit, not "answer-blocking" or anything else nefarious. If you'd like a better answer to your question, feel free to re-post it with more information including a clarification of what kinds of answers you're looking for.
This post was also a bit impolite. Certainly /u/Tenacious-Techhunter was a bit rude above, but if possible I'd like to avoid this kind of personal conflict on /r/Mathematica. Thanks for trying to answer his original question -- I'm sorry that it didn't turn out well. In any case, I don't see any reason for the argument below to continue, so I'm locking the whole post.
By doing this, will the scale of the logarithmic axis also be logarithmic, or will it just be linear, leaving the viewer to have to figure it out? This sounds like it might be a good way to handle LogPolar plots, if so.
Awesome. Thank you for sharing!
I'm not entirely sure what you're asking. The axis that I made logarithmic can clearly be seen as being logarithmic because of he numbers along it.
&gt; if you are wanting to insist on using Lists like arrays Could you please clarify? List is an obvious choice for 1-d data structures in Mathematica, I would say. 
I do suppose that was a strange way to word it. When I said &gt;insisting on using Lists like arrays I just meant if they only want to use imperative programming constructs such as `For` and `Do` and `While`, rather than functional constructs such as `Map`, `Select` and similar. When OP said &gt; without using any built-in functions, such as Prime I assumed that they meant they wanted to implement this in a way that would work in any language (mod syntax obviously) and not using any of WL considerable math functionality. So writing a `For` loop that uses the standard algorithm for the sieve. Since, obviously, it is impossible to write WL code that doesn't use any built-in WL syntax. That is kind of an oxymoron. But yes, of course using `List` is the obvious choice for storing 1-D data! Thanks for pointing that out 
Yeah, too many uses of the word "scale" here. After fiddling with your example a bit, I can see that it labels the tick marks of the axis (the scale) logarithmically, as opposed to using a linear scale that the viewer would have to interpret. Unfortunately, this doesn't work for Polar plots at all, PolarPlot just doesn't recognize the ScalingFunction; disappointing, to say the least.
What have you tried so far? Where are you stuck? 
&gt; The best way I've found to do this is with the 'Dynamic' function. &gt;Again, using the Dynamic function here, I think I've accomplished that. It seems to just act like a while-loop, but without any end criteria. Not a good idea IMO, I recommend to use some kind of While[True, ...] with waiting instead. But maybe it's just me hating Dynamic. &gt;Not sure if it will save to memory or hard drive as it runs. RAM if you don't have SWAP or something similar. &gt;Would anyone know why the plot seems to show that the timeseries list length is being limited, but evaluating the list separately shows contradicting results? Drop doesn't modify a list, you need to use something like a=Drop[a,...]. One serious problem with your approach: you use local time, which has nothing to do with the time of data generation. You better find a web-service which provides online data with time and parse it. I wouldn't rely on FinancialData.
Look at Quandl for your data. There is a great Mathematica plugin. You should also look at MovingMap. There are already a ton of functions like MovingAverage already builtin. Use them when you can as it will save you a ton of effort. I've very rarely come across a technical indicator where I didn't find a builtin Mathematica function. You can also ingest a stream into a SQL database and then get that data to Mathematica by accessing the same database. This is useful for some services that make you use a specific library to access data and have no public api. 
Thanks for the pointers. I hadn't thought about how invalid those times are in the time series - all I've accomplished is recording whatever time the data reaches my computer - and I'll look into replacing the dynamic function with awhile loop.
Thanks for the recommendations. Quandle told me it doesn't want to give me price quotes based on my 'use case' (personal, vs commercial or educational), but MovingMap definitely looks promising!
Thank you for your reply. I have tried changing the numbers in the range function to see if I could run the sieve in segments of a large range, rather than one large range at once; this failed. I don't know how to break a large range - for example, finding primes betweeen 2 and 1 billion - into smaller ranges of, say, 2 to 1 million, 1,000,001 to 2 million, etc. Any help would be appreciated! 
Usually math.
I model various semiconductor measurements.
Professionally: help with math related to theoretical nuclear physics. Privately: calculator on steroids, for anything else I enjoys using "real" programming languages way more.
I am an undergrad and a huge pure math enthusiast, so I like to use it for intense calculations or plotting trends whilst I explore math in my spare time. Maybe when I become a professional I‚Äôll get to use it for other reasons
Professionally: mostly data analysis and plotting (import a data file, apply transformation on the data, perform simple fits, and create graphs). Also differential equation solving. For more computationally intensive calculations like high-scale optimization or stochastic simulations, I prefer dedicated solvers or compiled languages. Personally: Project Euler‚Ä¶
Professionally, I use it to solve differential equations, convolve them with a gaussian, and fit data with it. So fancy exponential decays! I used to use it for checking my arithmetic. 
Well there are plenty of ways to get data so don't feel disheartened. I recommended Quandl because their data tends to be really high quality. If you have an account with a broker see how they provide historical data and if not maybe get in touch with a broker to see if they'll help. Just know that a lot of forex brokers' historical data isn't quite perfectly representative of the market but deviations should be small enough for anything but sub 15min time frames. For really high quality data you should expect to pay an absolute fortune. 
Rapid prototyping of data processing pipelines. Analysis of datasets and just messing with data at times till something interesting comes up. Exploring math in general. Checking my own work. Machine learning although I've gotten quite frustrated at how Wolfram has been implementing this so I've been slowly switching to tensorflow in Python. Throwing cool stuff together to impress people or use in presentations. Sometimes I can create visualisations and animations that really simplify complex stuff. My biggest thing though is I just really love exploring math in it. I use it professionally for prototyping but because of the licensing I end up implementing my actual end products in another language (usually Python). 
Obviously the documentation is incorrect. Dare you submit a patch, or would you like to continue your fruitless tirade against a system which has taken no notice of you so far?
You are aware that the complex logarithm is multi-valued, yes?
It depends on your definition of complex logarithm; you are aware that different people define the logarithm differently, yes? Mathematica's definition of complex logarithm is not multi-valued; you can infer that from this statement in the docs: &gt; Log[z] has a branch cut discontinuity in the complex z plane running from -oo to 0.
Mathematica only picks one branch of the ArcCoth at a time, so that you are dealing with a function. What you're doing in the post is equivalent to this: (-1)^2 = 1 = 1^2, so -1 = 1.
The documentation asserts that coth^(-1) is defined as is done in your code for *complex* arguments. It unfortunately does not specify how this is defined for real arguments. That definition poses no problems for x&gt;1 or x&lt;-1, but for real x in the interval (-1,1) it's unclear what definition is being used.
Complexes include the Reals.
The docs assert that for all x, ArcCoth@x == 1/2 (-Log[x - 1] + Log[x + 1]). The executable denies that assertion: In[62]:= Function[x, ArcCoth@x == 1/2 (-Log[x - 1] + Log[x + 1])][-1/2] Out[62]= False &gt; What you're doing in the post is roughly equivalent to this.... Not really.
Ignoring the ad hominem for now: The Background and Context section describes the *mathematical* context of the function. The set of all branches of `ArcCoth` is indeed equal to the set of all branches of `1/2(-Log[# - 1] + Log[# + 1])`. However, Mathematica's Log and ArcCoth both take one branch of Log, which may or may not coincide. In this case, it doesn't. Back to the ad hominem: I don't know who taught you that, but attacking the other party directly does not contribute anything to your argument. Half of your comment is irrelevant to the point you're making. It can be helpful if you consider the fact that you may be in the wrong.
&gt; the mathematical context of the function That exists only in your mind, even when you italicize the word 'mathematical'. What exists outside your mind is particular definitions written in particular places by particular people. &gt; The set of all branches of ArcCoth is indeed equal to the set of all branches of.... I'll finish this correctly for you. The set of all branches of ArcCoth is equal to the set of all branches of: -(1/2) Log[1 - 1/x] + 1/2 Log[1 + 1/x] Furthermore, that expression actually does equal ArcCoth. You have written a lot defending Wolfram's error, you sad person.
Try `TrigToExp[ArcCoth[x]]` and report back. The core of the issue is: `ArcCoth` has a branch-cut at 0, while `Log` doesn't. I see that you are simply a troll who refuses to acknowledge any wrong. I feel that it is now pointless to explain the mathematics behind why you got the seemingly erroneous result, since you would dismiss it.
You have such a fancy theory for why Mathematica contradicts its own documentation. I see you're simply defending Mathematica's bugs in hopes of impressing Stephen Wolfram who does not know your name.
You win. Believe what you want. Hey, delete this thread too because you're right and everybody else is wrong.
You have nothing to teach me about multi-valued functions, you pretentious jacker.
/r/IAmVerySmart
Also, carefully reread my comments when you have had enough time to process this information. You may ignore the criticisms, though.

Your stupidity is impressive but nothing compared to your arrogance. I can't believe people are still trying to help you despite being so confident, insulting, and most importantly, wrong at the same time. I bet you are a blast at parties. 
You appear to not want to learn. 
Someone needs to learn some complex analysis
I think OP's complaint is not "mathematics is broken" but rather "Mathematica doesn't take branch cuts in a consistent way" (or at least not consistent with their documentation). This was further obfuscated by OP's choice to be a complete ass when others tried to clarify the obvious issue Mathematica was encountering.
'k
same to you
Already have my dude
but I didn't? 'k
Well someone already did and I saw how that went, don't really feel like talking much to such a toxic person
You showed up to call me "toxic" yet try to impress be by announcing you had completed a basic math course. Clown.
Well you said "same to you", seemed like an appropriate response 
You should up to type: &gt; Someone needs to learn some complex analysis Really, wtf did you mean by that? I learned it at Stanford in the 80's. I aced it. I graduated Phi Beta Kappa. What was really your point? Really, I missed some aspect of complex analysis that you learned in your course last year? You fool.
You graduated from a top US uni and yet branch points are quackery ü§î
Of course, but Mathematica has the ability to recognize -1/2 as real.
You need to go back lol. Are you sure your grades weren't imaginary?
Seems you have a loose grasp on the meaning of "proves", mathematically speaking. 
Put the definition of alpha inside the manipulate. EG: Manipulate[ alpha= b1^q +b2^q; Plot[alpha, {q, 0, 1}], {b1, 1, 2}, {b2, 1, 2}]
i.e. wolfram has a loose grasp on the meaning of the term "documentation"
Maybe his GPA was 0... I mean `I*Pi`.
`Manipulate` only updates it's first argument if it *visibly* depends on the changing control values. So, create a function alpha with arguments or add some action using the control variables to the first argument. 
"branch points are quackery" no, that's just your illiteracy getting the best of you. See what I actually wrote, because you're recalling it wrong now
'k
Oh I guess I did misread it a bit Still though, I can't grasp how someone who's presumably in their 40s or 50s and is apparently very well educated is resorting to so many playground insults. It's really interesting that you accused me of gloating and yet you went off on how you've aced complex analysis, how you're a Standford graduate etc.. Like cool, glad you've had a successful career and education, I'm happy for you. Really, I am. It just comes across as very unprofessional. And I think the downvoted and general reaction from people are telling off that. Someone tried to be very reasonable with you and discuss things and you started insulting them for no reason. I just don't understand it at all.
&gt; Most of this shit you're saying is like, 14 year old YouTube commenter level u mean in my o.p. or just in response to like, 14 year old YouTube commenter level shit directed at me &gt; It just comes across as very unprofessional. review your original post in this thread, idiot
Just in general really Again, dude just tries to talk to you and discuss your post and you just throw insults at him. Are you like that in your day to day working environment, I wonder. And yes the image in the OP which I hadn't actually noticed before is a bit, childish? &gt;review your original post in this thread, idiot So you're not denying that you've acted unprofessionally. And all I did was make a cheeky remark after you'd already freaked out at people. Contrast that with, very childish and basic insults coming from a middle aged Standford graduate. My feeble mind just can't process it ü§î
&gt; are you like that in your day to day working environment In my day to day working environment, I would have fired you for your original comment, not because it was cheeky, but because it reflected incompetence on your part. I get paid well, pretty doctors, lawyers, and U.S. vice-president's daughter have wanted to date me; and you here trying to get me to see the error of my ways. Where did you get the idea I want to be more like you, you deluded imbecile.
and what happened was, you decided to attack me because you saw others attacking me, and you're an insecure follower; you act like you have a small penis
Holy shit there's a lot of arrogance to unpack in this comment, haha, and you accused me of gloating lol. I'm going to assume that you do indeed attack people verbally for no reason and childishly call them names in the workplace. You haven't denied and instead come out with some odd mental gymanastics.
*you act like you have a small penis* I can't believe this is coming out of the mouth of a grown man. Seriously dude, despite your apparent success, assuming you're not a troll, you seem genuinely unhinged and unhappy.
&gt; I'm going to assume that you do indeed attack people verbally for no reason and childishly call them names in the workplace. how many people care who you would fire? Zero, because you're not competent enough to get in a position where you make firing decisions; you're in no position to fire me or anyone like me, so cry to your mommy about how much you dislike me, fag 
p.s. remember before the election those people crying Trump is "unpresidential"? Yet he's President. Like you calling me "unprofessional", yet I make more money than you, so I guess you're the unprofessional one
Again with this bizzare mental gymnastics/deflection lol You're literally admitting you're a bad person, lol.

What even is this comment lol
you defend a computer program's bugs, there's no lower you can sink
no one cares about your opinion, autism posterboy
Yes. Try wrapping alpha with `Evaluate[alpha]`. 
Speak for yourself.
Its not a bug. Its user error.

You're on your computer living in a fantasy world where you're in some position to condescend to the people around you, because you took a basic math course, an awkward loser and a typical redditor, you autistic virgins should have a get together

Thanks. &gt;updates it's first argument if it visibly depends on the changing control values Is there a way to know which functions expect that? 
Thanks. This was a minimal example but it will look messy for a longer expression. Thought maybe there is a neater way to do it. 
Hmmm. I've seen that people use this. Documentation is not giving me a clear understanding of what `Evaluate` really does though. Seems that some functions need to be evaluated to be used as an argument in other functions. It is not clear to me what kinds of functions need this however.
See [here](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/EvaluationControl.html).
I think in the manipulate documentation theres some explanation for why it has to be that way. For example you have to be careful using functions inside manipulate. 
[removed]
This is specific to Manipulate and it's documented on its help page. 
`pi` should be upcase, like `Pi`(or something like that). In Mathematica all standard definitions start with upcase.
Still doesn‚Äôt know how to interpret it
Mathematica and Wolfram Alpha are entirely different products. Mathematica functions can not be run in Wolfram Alpha. Though, in Mathematica, you can use the WolframAlpha[] function to query Wolfram Alpha and interpret the results.
rip I‚Äôm gonna cringe at my mistake in a few months Thanks very much
Hey it's all good, no worries
I went ahead and ran the function you posted, in case you still need the answer. It's 6^(2/5) 2555^(1/5) or 9.83419
This is neat! Well done on the side project. Is this programmed just for ras-pi connectivity at the moment? What would it take to be used for arbitrary machine-to-machine connections, i.e. Windows &lt;-&gt; Linux? 
The work for general Linux (or Windows, with an SSH server) remote kernels would be pretty minimal. Right now the kernel binary path is hard-coded, but it could easily be promoted to an argument. Thanks for the hint on the Wolfram community!
It's not very clear to me what exactly you are looking for. What kind of feet you are looking for, please clarify? There are like an infinite number of approaches. For example, your curve is very smooth, so obviously you can fit it very well with just polynomials if enough parameters are used. numberOfTerms = 15; model = Total[a[#] x^(# - 1) &amp; /@ Range@numberOfTerms]; fit = model /. FindFit[dat, model, a[#] &amp; /@ Range@numberOfTerms, x]; Show[ ListPlot[dat, Frame -&gt; True], Plot[fit, {x, 0, dat[[-1, 1]]}, PlotStyle -&gt; Red] ] You can change the `numberOfTerms` variable to see how it depends on the number of parameters. Also, I think you may find this package very interesting: https://github.com/paulknysh/sym
As Mathematica has most necessary matrix algebra functions (crucially the matrix exponential) built in natively (both for symbolic and numerics) it is quite simple to roll most things yourself. For more complicated manipulations [QuantumUtils](https://github.com/QuantumUtils/quantum-utils-mathematica) is useful (disclaimer this was made by some colleagues). 
Why not use the proper definition of a function?
Or you could try this way: Manipulate[Plot[alpha/.{b1-&gt;bb1,b2-&gt;},{q,1,5}],{bb1,1,3},{bb2,2,3}]
Check NDSolve in Mathematica help.
I tried that, but I am still getting an InterpolatingFunction 
So here's one thing you can do that's a little bit of a cheat: f[t_]:=Sin[2 Pi t]; (* Use your ODE solution *) Plot[f[t],{t,0,2}] {fig, {pts}} = Reap[Plot[f[t],{t,0,2},EvaluationMonitor:&gt;Sow[{t,f[t]}]]]; indicesOfMax = Ordering[pts[[All,2]],-2]; pts[[indicesOfMax]] When Mathematica draws a plot, it uses an adaptive sampling routine to determine where the function changes quickly (i.e. it needs to place more points). Using `Sow[]` allows us to pull out those same points, from which you can sort the data and determine maxima. This won't work so well if one point is higher than the other (you'll have to crank up the `-2` in `Ordering[]` to detect the n^th largest sample values that hopefully capture your peaks), but it's at least a start. Without a well-behaved analytic function, I don't think you'll be able to do better than guess-and-check root finding or sampling.
First off, thank you so much! You have no idea how helpful you have been already. Secondly, I have peaks that are higher than one another. When I change the -2 in Ordering, it [adds more points to the tallest peak ](https://imgur.com/a/jNuzyiP) . If I increase the ordering enough, [all of the peaks are accounted for](https://imgur.com/a/Xv47bet) , but the highest one still has more points than necessary. What is the best way to avoid peaks having multiple points? 
[Table](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Table.html) is your best friend! width = 1/10; binned = BinLists[{0.0008, 0.10, 0.11, 0.11, 0.12, 0.24, 0.29, 0.31, 0.44, 0.49, 0.49}, width]; scaled = Table[binned[[i]] - (i - 1) * width, {i,Length[binned]}];
Oh my heck you're a lifesaver! I need to figure out all of these tricks. 
I would, loosely, say that any turing complete programming language *can* do anything math related. I suppose it depends on your definition of "do" and of "math", but, in general, yes. Also, in general, it can do it better then most languages (in terms of elegance, definitely not in terms of speed). Still, as much as we love to love and hate certain programming languages, anything that has an if-else, can store and retrieve bits from memory, and can add two binary numbers can "do" any mathematical operation.
As with all computer programming programs, they're only as capable as the user. I think it's more appropriate to say "Mathematica allows you to reach your full mathematical capabilities"
I don't think the question is about the Turing completeness of the language.
It most definitely would be mistake. As an easy example it can't tell if every valid input you give it will halt. This is a fundamental result of computer science called the [halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem). 
**[Halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem)** &gt;In computability theory, the halting problem is the problem of determining, from a description of an arbitrary computer program and an input, whether the program will finish running or continue to run forever. ***** ^[About](https://www.reddit.com/user/ultimatewikibot/comments/90r969/about) ^| ^[Leave](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=ultimatewikibot&amp;subject=Blacklist&amp;message=Me) ^[me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=ultimatewikibot&amp;subject=Blacklist&amp;message=Me) ^[alone](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=ultimatewikibot&amp;subject=Blacklist&amp;message=Me) 
I haven't yet found a good way to make it do contour integrals.
No. Its probably the most powerful and comprehensive piece of math software out there but it cannot do everything or do everything the best. For example, it sucks donkey nuts when it comes to Tensor Calculus but it's differential equations capabilities are so far ahead of everything else that there is no comparison. It handles ill conditioned matrices flawlessly where Matlab would choke, but deals with more traditional stuff a lot slower... For an undergrad studying math it can do everything they will encounter or work with. It will probably cover 90% of post graduate stuff too, but it's not a 100% complete solution. 
Fond answer here: https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/180111/what-is-the-easiest-way-to-get-truth-table-of-statement/180113#180113
The Wolfram Alpha interface does truth table well. In a new cell, type double equal sign (‚Äú==‚Äú) then something like ‚ÄúP &amp;&amp; Q truth table‚Äù. Works well for me.
The integral can in fact be symbolically integrated (use Integrate instead of NIntegrate) and it really doesn't seem to converge.
You cannot declare A[t_]^P, you should declare A[t_] := (...)^P And as advice, you should declare your expressions starting in lowercase, not uppercase. System expressions start with uppercase so to avoid problems, it's better if you start them lowercase. 
Thank you, seems it worked!
Can no one answer this question?
and these ones https://i.imgur.com/QKF197t.png
You mean "Can anyone solve my homework when I'll not even bother to ask a specific question about something I don't understand?", right?
Start from disabling all the printer services and testing whether this helps, I'd suggest. 
If you bothered to look at the appendices you can see the OP attempted the question to their fullest and couldn't see why it wasn't working. It doesn't take a savant to realise that if they knew where they were going wrong that they wouldn't be resorting to a dead forum full of arrogant Arschl√∂cher such as yourself. All the required information is in the attachments and such elegance is only expected of a physicist. As someone who isn't quite as pretentious, I noticed that the angular frequency should be expressed in terms of the angular position (as instantaneous angular frequency is the first time derivative of angular position for pendulums undergoing simple harmonic motion); this is seen in the preliminary reading to the question also. Hence the latter parameters should appear: [Œ∏1[t1],Œ∏1'[t1]] which should give you the desired graph. Thus, the new code: Plot[ pendulumTotalEnergy[1, 10, 1][Œ∏1[t1],Œ∏1'[t1]], {t1, 0, 10}, PlotRange -&gt; All, AxesLabel -&gt; {"t", "Etot"}] should have no syntax problems.
What specifically do you want to calculate? Can you right equations you are trying to solve? 
I want to he able to calculate the resonant frequencies that occur when waves resonate in specific shapes
So, you want eigenfrequiencies and corresponding eigenmodes? Of which specifically operators? Just laplacian on 2d surfaces or something more complicated?
What is your policy on social issues? Most of the AI subreddits at a point in time had far too many imaginary social issues as talking points such as the role of women in AI, how the AI field is sexist/racist/homophobic, AI is too Western and so on and so forth. Not enough women in AI was a particularly common one... That basically irritated me to the point I no longer frequent many of those subreddits. Things may have changed but the moderators who held the position that imaginary social issues were as valid and important as a revolutionary breakthrough pissed me off. 
I think == only works with numerical values. `TrueQ[N[x1]==N[x2]]` does indeed return `True`. Hope this help.
Thanks for the reply. Both x1 and x2 as I've described are numbers, not symbolic expressions. For simpler versions == comparisons seem to work fine, at least after applying FullSimplify to both terms. The problem with using 'N[x1] == N[x2]' is that this can fail though in this example it works. The reason is because x1,x2 are being numerically evaluated in different formulas and one float may end up different than the other due to intermediate rounding errors. 
Yeah, sorry I don't know. This is way past my knowledge in maths... :S
&gt;Opinions on important society or business issues; &gt;Really funny jokes about machine learning and AI. No, thanks. It's a perfect way to attract almost exclusively wannabees. 
It looks like you're looking for the function Manipulate. You can test it with the code below. `Manipulate[Plot[a x , {x, 0, 100}, PlotRange -&gt; {{0, 100}, {0, 10}}], {a, 0.05, 0.20, (0.25/200)}]`
Do you want all the values simultaneously or a slider that you can move to change them? If you want a slider then use Manipulate. If you want all of them simultaneously then use Table[] and plot the Table (which usually means just passing the table in). 
What have you tried so far?
I found out the electric field arrangement of 3 charges and did a vector plot of it. How to find the integral curve ?
If you post the code you tried we might be able to see where you went wrong
That's right, and the *Mathematica* syntax allow you to even insert all you experimental data into that form as well and it gives you what you want (namely each experimental data point shifted by the theoretical value, and then each of those points scaled by the theoretical value). An example: You know your theoretical value is 50, and your 100 points of data are within 15 on either side. Clear[theo,data,PE] SeedRandom[1234] {theo,data}={50,RandomReal[{35,65},100,WorkingPrecision-&gt;5]} PE[exp_,theo_]:=(exp-theo)/theo 100//Abs &gt; {50, {61.298, 59.850, 35.242, 42.829, 48.473, 52.893, 50.647, 46.077, 62.511, 58.917, 56.775, 57.113, 63.147, 46.770, 35.591, 39.619, 37.466, 58.407, 53.067, 53.416, 55.688, 55.737, 60.069, 58.077, 52.958, 53.564, 63.789, 64.400, 51.001, 56.344, 59.668, 37.373, 43.348, 58.982, 61.727, 48.293, 63.392, 55.656, 53.696, 52.464, 39.670, 51.368, 62.677, 55.125, 52.753, 53.835, 36.677, 63.921, 63.397, 60.174, 40.376, 49.012, 47.715, 62.910, 63.318, 49.809, 36.736, 50.866, 61.909, 56.149, 43.367, 35.310, 55.261, 51.200, 60.857, 48.147, 55.540, 42.215, 49.010, 40.450, 45.665, 59.661, 45.104, 59.235, 40.592, 62.184, 38.355, 63.906, 35.141, 55.966, 36.351, 53.081, 51.351, 50.267, 51.872, 40.910, 39.822, 42.280, 56.733, 62.599, 38.945, 53.529, 50.265, 44.023, 45.380, 56.928, 44.707, 54.042, 60.392, 63.161}} Now we can find the percent/fractional error/uncertainty in the data as you have, and see the error for each data point.

Hope this helps.
Thanks for the response! I fixed that, but I still get the same thing when I execute it (besides the exp part being right now).

You probably won't get much traction here based on the way you presented this. It is unclear what you are trying to communicate. In any case, you probably want to used Sqrt[ ] instead of sqrt(). 
Yikes, this is embarrassing. That...was the issue. Thanks!
So after /u/p_toad swiftly found the issue, another one arose: "Encountered non-numerical value for a derivative at t == 0." I am trying to solve parabolic motion with air resistance. 
Check your parenthesis/brackets, because what you just put works e.g.: f[x_, y_] := Abs[x - y]; Plot3D[f[x, y], {x, -10, 10}, {y, -10, 10}] Doesn't spit out any errors or problems.
1. Version control software works best with text. Version control with MM notebooks is hard, we end up writing in the text version of Wolfram Language to simplify merges. 2. Use a modern font like [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)
&gt;Version control software works best with text Mathematica notation is stored as ascii, it just displays to you visually. Copy and paste a cell to an ascii editor then paste it back, and you can see how it goes back and forth. &gt;Use a modern font like Fira Code Whoa cool thanks! I had no idea this was a thing. It's a step in the right direction, I so desperately need a more visual environment to program, ascii blurs together in my head, my brain thinks more in spacial visuals than language
For starters, you have way too many unnecessary brackets and you need a space between m and g to multiply them. Another problem, which may be what is generating the error, is that the functions you are solving for should be entered as a list {Vx[t],Vy[t]} Youre current syntax is like trying to solve the equations for function Vx[t], which depends on the variable Vy[t]. This clearly is nonsense and so you get an error. Also remember that the help documentation has information about error messages, which can tell you what is wrong.
Thank you! I cleaned up the brackets on my code and I applied you're suggest fix and was able to get an answer.
Hello, &gt;How would that be but into Mathematica as a function? [Functions](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/VariablesAndFunctions.html) are defined with the `:=` syntax. Also, try not to use variables that start with a capital, as they can collide with built-in symbols (in your example, `E` would be understood by Mathematica as Euler's number (2.71828...) and not as an energy). So you could write your function as: kt[temp_] := k Exp[e/r (1/tempi - 1/temp)] &gt;Also, the variable I am trying to solve for, that is dependant on that temperature would be inputted as V\[T\], right? Probably not, but it is difficult to help you on that point without knowing more about what you are trying to do.
Is that 3.2 million or 323 thousand?
Are these numbers arbitrary precision or machine precision?
Might be arbitrary now that I think about it
What about using `Export[‚Äúname.csv‚Äù, TheList]`
Right. That was what I was evaluating.
Well csvs are great for compact (but uncompressed) storage and can be easily imported with `TheList = Import["name.csv"]`. I would think that would be much faster than trying to store it as a .m file which is really meant for storing executable code and not raw data.
Thanks! Good to know. I will try that.
Whilst you can, I don't believe in saving any data as *.m. Export it to a CSV ideally or if you want export it as a *.hdf5 (pretty great format.) The only time I would consider saving as *.m would be in the rare case I need to store something very unique, but by default I want to export it as some standard format. One of Mathematica's greatest strengths is the insane number of formats you can import and export. 
Is `n` already defined in your notebook? It's black in the first definition. This is likely causing issues.
It is used yes! But i gave an all clear command above it. So it should be good not? I try it tomorrow and let u know. Thanks for helping !
 Your clear command was invalid.
I took the habit of always starting the cells where I define my functions with `ClearAll`: ``` mathematica ClearAll[foo] foo[bar_] := baz ``` It saved me of uncountable problems with remains of previously defined functions coming back to bite me after I changed the definition. And for a real fresh start, nothing tops `Quit[]` of course!
% Rasa[tabula]
Sounds like a great tutorial.
Yes it is fixed now, thank you! I should have noted that the Clear command was not right, but it is good now. Next time Ill also try to take notice of the variables.
1) I don't really know how FindFormula works, but from what I can read on documentation page, it's only capable of fitting x-y data. "sym" can handle multiple variables and is more general and customizable. For example, I was successfully using it for solving integral equation of a specific form. 2) A basic default Error function is actually provided in "How do I run the procedure?" section in README. The key idea in constructing any Error is to use replace operator (/.) to replace symbols with values of interest. As for tradeoff between complexity and fitness, this is not implemented (at least yet). Actually, any idea on how to "measure" the complexity of the model/expression?
&gt; Actually, any idea on how to "measure" the complexity of the model/expression? There are theoretical frameworks that allow to do just that: [AIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion), [BIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_information_criterion) among others. They balance the quality of the fit with the number of parameters. In this case, we don't really have parameters, but a symbolic tree. Perhaps [LeafCount](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LeafCount.html) could help?
**Akaike information criterion** The Akaike information criterion (AIC) is an estimator of the relative quality of statistical models for a given set of data. Given a collection of models for the data, AIC estimates the quality of each model, relative to each of the other models. Thus, AIC provides a means for model selection. AIC is founded on information theory. *** **Bayesian information criterion** In statistics, the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) or Schwarz criterion (also SBC, SBIC) is a criterion for model selection among a finite set of models; the model with the lowest BIC is preferred. It is based, in part, on the likelihood function and it is closely related to the Akaike information criterion (AIC). When fitting models, it is possible to increase the likelihood by adding parameters, but doing so may result in overfitting. Both BIC and AIC attempt to resolve this problem by introducing a penalty term for the number of parameters in the model; the penalty term is larger in BIC than in AIC. The BIC was developed by Gideon E. Schwarz and published in a 1978 paper, where he gave a Bayesian argument for adopting it. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Mathematica/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
You forgot to copy the code into the comments.
I think it is trying to replace `x‚Äô[t]` but only `x[t]` exists in the previous line which might trip it up. Try `D[x[t]/.%,t]`
didn't work &amp;#x200B;
This is a lot of work to get MMA to handle your units, what's the motivation in doing it this way? Move dimensions out of your integral and it should be trivial. 
I did it that way because I sort of know what units I expect out at the end of the calculation and rather that the units match as a check to see if I did something wrong. I got it to work now though, had to use the function Module (found it online somewhere). Thanks anyway. 
When I'm unsure about them, I treat units as undefined variables. I honestly don't understand why this overhead is helpful, but if it works, it works! 
They‚Äôll give you a longer trial if you ask.
Affordability is relative. They offer a student license, and a home license (which I'm on), which are both significantly less than the full-on commercial license.
Yeah, I've looked at the student license. Not a bad discount by any means, I'm just on a tight budget.Especially with it being a hobby purchase for me.
I understand. Mine was also a hobby purchase, and it was even on a 20% discount (at Amazon, no less) before I pulled the trigger. I'm retired, so I buy toys I would never have considered before :-) Something to look forward to with age...
You can buy a Raspberry Pi, install Raspbian (the default Linux distribution), and have a functioning and legal Mathematica without timing restrictions. It won't be fast but it's surprisingly usable. Wolfram made this to expose more people to Mathematica, I suppose. There is not really an open-source alternative in terms of features and cohesiveness-of-design. Some people may recommend that you give Sage a try, which is Python-based. But personally I'm not a big fan. What kind of things do you plan on doing with it?
+1 for Jupyter Notebooks. In addition to the aforementioned sympy and numpy, I'd highly recommend using [Julia](https://julialang.org/). High-level language designed for numerical computation and speed.
Wolfram Cloud is also free for basic use cases, easy to lean there.
What are you using it for?
Given your post history, I think you should hire yourself.
Truthfully, I dunno exactly. I feel like I should learn a mathematically-oriented language, and I have a friend that absolutely raves about it for all sorts of uses, including prototyping.
Sage!
#Code clearAll ("Global`*") alt = Import[ "C:\\Users\\Daniel Moreau\\Documents\\Wolfram \ Mathematica\\alt.csv", "csv"]; dt = alt[[;; , 1 ;; 6]]; y = alt[[;; , 7]]; d = DateObject[dt]; DateListPlot[Transpose[{d, y/1000}], ListLinePlot[temp, GridLines -&gt; Automatic, PlotRangePadding -&gt; 0, Frame -&gt; True, FrameLabel -&gt; {"Time, Seconds", "Altitude, Kilometers"}, PlotLabel -&gt; "Balloon Altitude Data", BaseStyle -&gt; {FontSize -&gt; 12}, PlotRange -&gt; All, ImageSize -&gt; Scaled[100/100]]]
Heyo, so your code is kind of useless since we can't access the csv file. Also, what is temp? It's not defined in this block. &amp;#x200B; In any case, I used just the listlineplot bit with a vector of random reals and the labels printed perfectly well which suggests it's something to do with the DateListPlot\[ bit. &amp;#x200B; Can you give a MWE that replicates the issue? 
This is a mess. Don‚Äôt mesh Plot objects. Combine them with Show. 
Talk to sales and ask really nicely what they can do for you and what your situation is. You'd be surprised with how much they may be able to help. If you're a student, even if your university doesn't have a license, they may throw you a bone. Heck, even if you just want to play, they may throw you a bone some other way like a renewable trial. They're a really nice company. With good people who want you to use and enjoy their software. 
Sorry about that, this is my second time using mathematica. It's for a class where we're learning it. [Here is the download link](http://courses.eece.maine.edu/ece101/lab/alt.csv) to alt.csv. It's weather balloon altitude data. Column 1 is year, 2 is month, 3 is day, and so on until it gets to column 6 in seconds. Column 7 is the altitude in what I believe is meters. The rows are each second the data is recorded until it gets to 16384 seconds. I did what /u/martinky24 suggested and put that block in, and I also took out temp. I'm also not sure how to export it as a MWE, but [here's what I have right now.](https://i.imgur.com/bJUHKgk.png) It's giving me errors.
1) Your fist clearAll line isn't doing anything in your code. Just get rid of it. Poor syntax. It should be ClearAll["Global`*"] 2) Your ListLinePlot function doesn't have an argument, only options.
I think I have everything except your derivation rule which I don't understand: &gt; s[args:Plus[_,__]] := s /@ args &gt; s[c_?NumberQ*x_] := c s[x] &gt; s[c_?NumberQ] := c n
