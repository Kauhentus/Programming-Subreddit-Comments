Yes, and that's actually the textbook way of resolving overload type paralysis. Of course once you do that, you're back to relying on runtime evaluation, which makes the whole idea of performing set theory through generic types even sillier than it already was.
Nope. Read the first paragraph again, about two track model.
*by a C# fan. Thank you ;]
The concrete difference is that SmallTalk-style message passing gives you what Ruby calls `send()` and `method_missing()`. Which is very nice if you're implementing the handful of things, such as RPC libraries, where that's actually a net gain rather than making it very hard to figure out what the members of an instance actually are. See JSON.net, which uses the DLR features so that a `JsonDictionary`, if cast to `dynamic`, can have its contents accessed as if fields, like in Javascript. But this doesn't stop a program given unfamiliar JSON from throwing, and it deprives you of a machine-readable declaration of what's expected. So it doesn't help all that much.
Possibility to use a bus or a queue for communication between objects leaves a choice to use async/sync or even distributed channel of communication. That is the biggest consequence IMO, much more important than just fully dynamic dispatch
We can use exceptions, we can use the Null Object pattern, we can use null propagation, the two track model or simple null checks. It will work in every case (better or worse, sooner or later). Every solution has got possible disadventages and adventages. Null checks too - because sometimes simples solution is the best solution.
I do wonder if a designated help sticky might be better. It could be a text post for all questions to be posted in as top-level comments. That way, questions as simple as "what is '`f++`'" don't need to be their own post *and* we have an easy to find catalogue of all existing questions.
&gt; The features mentioned in the notes look to be mostly syntactic sugar That was my first thought too, but as I read it again this morning, I don't see how it makes the code simpler to write or to re-understand.
It's as simple as: var valueHelper = new ValueHelper(); var result = valueHelper.FindValue(new[] { 1, 2, 3 }); Assert.AreEqual(6.40m, result); You don't want to use Moq here, because you don't have dependency. You use Moq to mock dependencies, so you can test the actual class to test (here `ValueHelper`) without requiring the dependencies. For example if you want to test a class that is **using** `IValueHelper`, then you would mock this interface instead of using `ValueHelper`. That way you test the actual class you want to test in isolation, and not test any other classes.
Well it's pretty unstable to say the least. For example, if you add a nuget package and do `dnu restore` IDE still thinks package does not exists and shows errors even tho when you press "Play" it compiles w/o problems. This is pretty major bug IMO.
Thanks, I was not aware of this. Looks like you have to fudge around with the tt templates if you use the designer, I suppose better than nothing.
Have a look at the Circuit Breaker http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html 
You always have to change the TT templates if you use the designer in any meaningful project. There will always be that Users1 collection on some entity :)
Can anybody explain me why you would pick this over VS+R#? Android Studio (also IntelliJ platform) consumes a ton of memory (1gb compared to VS 250mb), has a tendency to freeze when typing, has inferior IntelliSense (it doesnt show method parameters remotely as nice as VS) and has a sort of weird layout where you cant even remove some panel buttons on the side. Please explain before voting me down like hell, thank you. EDIT: Yes, Linux is a big point.
Any reason why you are not using [RiotSharp](https://github.com/BenFradet/RiotSharp)? Without source it's hard to say what's wrong. My guess would be that you don't intialize the lists that use in the RootObject or its subclass.

Jon Skeet can use inheritance on structs. Jon Skeet already wrote a book on C# 7. In the future, Anders will open the book to find out if he got it right.

Oh also, the answer to your question is probably "Yes". You can do pretty much anything with a full C#.NET (WinForms/WPF/Console) application; it's just a question of how much effort will be required.
Yeah, that's why I'm trying to find stuff, when searching for voice stuff, they either use an array full of many words or doesn't use voice for writing the thing itself. I'm still quite new to the language so I'm unfamiliar with a lot of code.
Very cool, although it would be nice if we could see the source code.
I want to be able to have a repo but every time i try to use git everything gets all fucked up after a few commits
Looks really nice, did you use a library for the material design? 
Probably not too popular but you could always try subversion. Although I recommend working out any troubles you have with git.
I love the look and customization, source?
nope, ive been developing my own library. but ive checked out butchersboy's Material Design in XAML toolkit and hes got a lot of great styles for common controls
Have you considered maybe tapping into the built-in accessibility text dictation feature of Windows? http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/dictate-text-speech-recognition#1TC=windows-7 Maybe you can just use standard text entry and leverage that accessibility feature to "type" the text in for you.
Use [`Int32.Parse`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b3h1hf19%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) to convert the text into an `int` with which you can then easily evaluate if it's between 0 and 255. There are other similar parsing methods you can use for `float`, `byte`, `bool`, and so on. Once you have that done, maybe you can skip ahead of your class a little bit and attempt using [`Int32.TryParse`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f02979c7%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) which can better handle non-numeric input and perhaps make your program a bit simpler.
What does you text file look like? It looks like your going about this the whole wrong solution. My guess is you have data that looks like this in your file 10 150.0 99999 0.97 etc... If that is the case you will want to look at string.split to get each of these string into an element of an array. Once you have that you the can check each string to see what type best fits it in a number of ways. 
I think I'm going to leave it now until I'm a bit better with the language, but that's a good idea if I can do so. Thanks!
+1 for this solution.
Try running vs+r# on &lt;not windows&gt;. Developing .net stuff on &lt;not windows&gt; and for &lt;not windows&gt; may become kinda relevant, since .netcore and stuff
&gt; ou t My textfile looks like this atm. 1 255 300 0.3 a hey true 222223333 I will take a look at the string.split
Would rather have 'em spend more time on the next big thing than introducing duplicate ways of programming. I get a very 'dynamic language' feeling from this. Really prefer the old way because that's how you go about the rest of the language. These specific cases just seem eye candy to me and doesn't speed up development.. nor makes it any more readable (unless you come from a dynamic language, maybe). Just 'cooler' I guess.
I think i solved it by string decodedString = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(array); and if(Int32.Parse(decodedString) &lt;= 255 &amp;&amp; Int32.Parse(decodedString) &gt;= 0)
git is, unfortunately, not newbie friendly. Mercurial, or subversion are good alternatives for source control but not for sharing. I would recommend working it out as thats just where the community is for source control. Worse case start a new repository and just upload it there for sharing.
Good job! You'll find as you go along you'll find easier/better/simpler/faster ways of doing such things, but for now, keep up with the problem solving and good luck with your studies!
What are you using for the chat transport? Custom, rabbitmq or xmpp?
That is indeed a good point.
There might be different reasons. Here are some of them: 1. Visual Studio + ReSharper isn't as stable for everyone as it luckily is for you. VS2015 is usually worse in this regard than its prior recent releases. On the other hand, IntelliJ products are working smoothly for many people (which is unfortunately not true in your case.) 2. You can't use Visual Studio outside Windows. There's apparently a lot of developers who are only using their Windows VM for .NET development in Visual Studio; apart from that, they just live and breathe OS X. 3. There's a bunch of products based on the IntelliJ platform, and developers of all sorts get increasingly used to its UX, actions and keyboard shortcuts, which makes Rider a more familiar environment from the start. 4. There's a different bunch of developers who have traditionally seen Visual Studio as merely a host to ReSharper. That said, it will probably take time for Rider to appeal to developers who have not developed affinity for IntelliJ platform tools and/or are happy with their experience with Visual Studio, with or without ReSharper. (Of course, ReSharper is here to stay; Rider is simply an alternative option for .NET developers.)
Good comedian choices...you look like an O&amp;A&amp;J fan...
i was using the Git tool integrated in VS 2015. it works great until something goes wrong and then i dont know how to fix any errors
I'm not too fond of the built-in Git tools in VS, so I either use Atlassian's excellent [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) app, or just drop back to the CLI. If you intend to use Git long-term, you really should learn to use it's CLI; it's super powerful.
Ok! Try Git GUI then. For the most simple stuffs, like selecting files to commit it's quite easy, imo. I only use bash when I need to do something more complex. I mostly use the VS for the modified icon and the quick undo button. I understand you tho. I scrapped the first few git repositories I made. I copied all the files I wanted into another directory and started a new one because there was something going on that I didn't understand.
Might I ask why you're not fond of VS's git integration in Team Explorer? I've personally preferred it over sourcetree since 99% of the time I just need something simple and at least I've found merges are easy to understand in Team Explorer. Then for everything else there is CLI.
Ah, Fair enough. I've not done many projects that have also been edited on a Linux so I've not really had that issue yet. Thanks.
Is WPF fairly popular in the community? I have some experience with it from an old job. I completed switched off the Microsoft stack, so I'm just curious how it's holding up. Looks great though! Nice work. 
Interesting stuff, but kind of impractical, no?
SourceTree became a lot less excellent with their latest update, they've redesigned the UI so it's a sea of flat grey buttons that all look disabled even though they aren't.
You pretty much got the only solid answer you're going to get in your other post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/48niwy/how_accurate_is_converting_java_source_code_to_c/). Your biggest hurdle in the port will likely be the GUI areas; you probably won't be able to port that at all and it will have to be made from scratch. Otherwise, what you're describing is a typical line-of-business application. .NET is particularly suited to creating these types of applications so it should be quite possible for it to be built in C#.NET. However, it's quite possible you may be underestimating the amount of work and knowledge necessary. (e.g., database access? User management? Excel/spreadsheets?) Anyhow, as such, I don't think this question, as written, is a good fit for /r/csharp so it's removed for now.
I recommend looking into rabbitmq, it has always been very friendly to use.
I would use [Int32.TryParse](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f02979c7.aspx) instead of trusting the input will in fact be a number.
What type of material maybe felt or sumtin tsss. Take us out you piece of shit!
You coulda used black like Lamar's peckah. Dvvv dvvv dvvv. 
i designed it for use on 5-10 microsoft surface tablets in a manufacturing environment (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCgnWqoP4MM this one) for the machine operators to communicate and request parts to certain locations, so it shouldnt be too much of an issue. ill look into it though
also VS Studio didn't support ssh remotes the last time I used it 
I'd love this to be a starting point for TextSecure / Signal for Windows. 
What is the code trying to accomplish? You have contestants and associated categories, what do you need to do after you have that? What is the end result?
It's supposed to ask how many contestants there are, after the user enters the number it prompts the user to enter the name of the contestant and a code for the category that the person wants to enter, then it shoots that information down to the contestant class and searches the array to make sure that the category exists and returns the code and description of the code. If if the code doesn't exists it shoots back an invalid code category. At the end its supposed to display all the contestants and their categories.
You can use an attached property and a custom style to achieve placeholder text, although i inherited from textbox to make HintedTextBox where i can specify a hint (placeholder text) and an icon. I used these hintedtextboxes on the login screen.
Looks great! Did you use an MVVM framework? Did you make the material theme yourself? I feel like MVVM pattern grew up out of WPF but WPF-XAML didn't mature with it. They just tacked on a couple of ban-aids here and there like the blend extensions. I wish they would open it up so the community could clean it up. Otherwise maybe Perspex will end up more pleasant to work with.
i dont even know what angularjs is, ive seen it around... maybe i should look into it!
&gt; HintedTextBox I ended up using something like this http://www.ageektrapped.com/blog/the-missing-net-4-cue-banner-in-wpf-i-mean-watermark-in-wpf/ last time. I'd love to help with git if you'd like. 
Please include the relevant code you're using that produces the error. Also, debug the program checking all your input values to the relevant methods, and check the documentation. The error you're getting indicates that you're probably calling the API with incorrect values.
Interesting, using adorner... hmm heres a gif of what i ended up with. The animation is choppy in the shitty gif and its sped up for some reason but you get the idea http://i.imgur.com/k5VqIxY.gif
that sounds awesome... ill definitely check that out. Yeah i tried to learn web development, i know my way around the basics of JS JQuery HTML CSS SCSS and a tiny bit of shitty PHP but everything is so fucking awful from a UI design perspective. Trying to lay out controls on a page with CSS is my least favorite thing in the world
How are you on Bootstrap? boostrap is effectively wpf grids, the only difference is imagine the column total always has to add up to 12. so this in wpf: &lt;Grid&gt; &lt;Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt; &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="3*" /&gt; &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="9*" /&gt; &lt;/Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt; &lt;TextBox Grid.Column="0" Text="Sidebar"/&gt; &lt;TextBox Grid.Column="1" Text="Main"/&gt; &lt;/Grid&gt; becomes this in html: &lt;div class="container"&gt; &lt;div class="row"&gt; &lt;div class="col-md-3"&gt;Sidebar&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="col-md-9"&gt;Main&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; and as long as you remember, there is only one container, and columns always go inside rows it is exactly the same. then you use margin, background colour etc, in exactly the same way as wpf. 
i guess... Ive used bootstrap and materialize grids and they are not too bad, but you cant do a columndefinitionanimation on them, you cant change them at runtime really, and you cant specify pixels or row/col spans
This is mad nice! Good job
I am by no means an expert coder.. but from what I can see in order to determine if the user entered a correct category code you need some sort of IsValid property. This would return a bool. in the set clause you can add some sort of validation like a for loop that cycles through your array and matches it to your input. Then you could make a simple method to determine whether it is true or not using the properties value that will be returned. This is what I would try, but would happily hear some advice from more seasoned coders, since I am still a newbie lol. But I hope this is helpful. Edit: changed some wording to make it clearer.
That means your webpage is fully client-side rendered, though. When you use something on server side, like Grails (which is honestly pure awesomeness), you can also interact with clients where your JS doesn’t load.
Thanks I'll try that. Don't worry though I'm a newbie too.
We use subversion. It's not perfect but it does the job. Any type of file and it has VS integration, although we do updates and commits in Windows explorer using tortoisesvn. It's nice because it automatically adds new files to source control.
I never claimed to be practical ;)
What is wrong with Mercurial? We like it better than git and it has the same options as Git.
There's nothing wrong with Mercurial, it's just not as accepted as git. People share on git hub pretty easily, and it's a popular place for that. Personally I hate git, but that's where people are. Mercurial and SVN are both fine for source control, you just don't have a popular git hub like alternative for it.
Yeah, be very careful with that. Honestly, it sounds like you likely won't have the rights to share the code without your employer's permission.
but im an hourly employee and i developed almost all of it on my own time
I'm working on one. I've been using SIMD as backing vectors for colors mostly but also leverage it for rotating and matrix effects. https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageProcessor Still early doors though.
You developing it doesn't mean it's your code. Anything you write specifically for work (as in you are hired and paid to write the code) without a doubt belongs to your employer. As far as your side project is concerned, that can be a bit more complicated and would depend on the state you live in and any contracts you may have signed. I'm not saying one way or another with your case. It just sounds like your employer might have a claim, if they chose to, so cover your ass before you choose to share the code. You can read up about it online. Here's a quick result I found for ya: http://asp-software.org/www/misv_resources/business-articles/who-owns-the-code/
I would use a dictionary named category to store the codechar-category pair. That way you'll just need category[CodeChar] to get the description. 
checkout typescript. It's a nice bridge between JS and C#. 
Looks great. &lt;3 Did you use a library or is it completely self written. And whats the name of the Font u use. Great Work Sorry for bad english
Thanks
This is all very pretty, but where's the code? This is /r/csharp not /r/design :p
Are you also vegan?
`res` is a single element. `query` is your enumeration that you want to create a list from. Are you sure that's the issue? Did you check which reference is `null`?
Oh, ok thanks. So I would do something like this..? List&lt;XElement&gt; toDelete = query.ToList(); But, how do I execute the query and remove the ID filtered nodes from my XML doc?
It looks pretty neat.
Git is actually pretty friendly if you use it via GUI solutions such as GitHub Windows Client. It's also not THAT hard to go with the cli version as all you will ever need is just commit-ing changes and pushing and reverting changes if you fuck up with some of the commits. It is pretty useful for the development too, as you will be able to manage it better.
I can see your point. However, you don't know what model the repository will use but we still need a way to construct it. So T as IEntity is there to facilitate that. The alternative would be public interface IRepository&lt;object&gt; Which is even worse. At least the empty interface allows extensibilty. You can force a minimum contract on the repository object if you wish. That would even trace back to the database, forcing tables to conform to a certain standard outlined in the IEntity contract. It's there by default. EF doesn't know what kind of model you are wanting to use and IEntity provides an opportunity to apply some constraints on that model.
`ToList()` never returns null.
You should look further into what is actually causing the null reference exception. Neither `res` nor `query` should ever be null in this context, as far as I know. I'm guessing one of your `&lt;Person&gt;` doesn't have an ID attribute, and accessing the nonexistent attribute's `Value` property throws the exception when the query is enumerated.
You got me there, nice comment on the topic purposed. Well done pointing out I used M$
Very true. I always hated doing things like triggers on certain UI events. Always seemed to require bloated sections of seemingly redundant tags. Also shit like &lt;Grid&gt; &lt;Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt; &lt;ColumnDefinition&gt; That's not too bad of an example, but I always felt like this kind of stuff bloats the xaml
1. It's "MS" or "Microsoft", not "M$". Please grow up. 2. Mono is still not a Microsoft product. Mono was sponsored by Xamarin, but it does not belong to Xamarin. 3. There's plenty of information available for .NET Core, which is a cross-platform framework made by Microsoft. 4. Microsoft has no interest in Mono, as they're working on .NET Core.
1. M$ = Microsoft 2. M$ has purchased xamarin the main production team for mono 3. .NET is an open standard much like HTMl that M$ has worked on but but does not lay came to 4. Yep M$ will most likely kill mono if possible
[removed]
Looks impressive
You're not getting downvoted because Microsoft is conspiring against you, you're getting downvoted because you made [6 rambling, barely comprehensible posts](http://i.imgur.com/rPui2Uu.png) on the same topic in the span of an hour. Edit: Scratch that, 7 and counting.
8 did that last one meet you criteria of acceptable?
I really like the UI. Very easy on the eyes. 
I am a developer with an invested interest in .NET this seems like a simple question to pose to the community, what non-Microsoft possibility exist from here going forward. Does this not interest you?
Hmm, ok. But, if I go: Console.WriteLine(res); // in the foreach loop .. I get: &lt;Person ID="666"&gt; &lt;FirstName&gt;Donald&lt;/FirstName&gt; &lt;LastName&gt;Trump&lt;/LastName&gt; &lt;/Person&gt; So, I don't really know what's going on! :P 
To be frank, I feel quite comfortable with MS's new direction, considering how their recent open sourcing of most of the framework. I'm hoping they'll do the same with Xamarin, which would be a huge benefit to the entire .Net-community. But the problem is your approach. Spam/troll until someone bites. Apparently, I'm more stupid than average, since I fell for it.
Are you a .NET dev? Have you used mono? Are you interested in who will lead the core mono.NET project?
.NET is an amazing language with wide community support such as in Linux.
You do realize that they are developing it on GitHub with lots of contributions from the community? Ben Adams, for instance, has done a lot of great work on Kestrel.
Please stop paying attention to that child. Instead report this post.
Please stop paying attention to that child. Instead report this post.
.NET Core is open source, works on OS X, Linux and BSD, and Mono isn't really going anywhere just because Xamarin was bought by MS.
Oh, that's excellent - thanks! But, I still can't go: foreach (var res in query.ToList()) { res.Remove(); } My "Guest.xml" at least stays the same.. I'm sure there's some misunderstanding on my part.
I have no issue with M$ development of .NET and I am happy to see it open, but I see a need for diversity in the .NET system. It seems dangerous to have M$ as a central development with the loss of xamarin, it is primarily a M$ endeavor.
You are only manipulating the `XDocument` that you loaded into memory, not the file it came from. You need to save it back to the file after you changed it.
From scratch! 
Great, that makes sense! Thank you.
"Error establishing a database connection"
somewhere in 2016
I'm actually in the process of doing this, as the other developer on the project seems to be obsessed with it.
I'm wondering the same thing. 
I'll admit I've done it before. The reason I've use this pattern (IEntity) is because it ensures that my models are cleaner (not including db fields such as Id, as they are included in a BaseEntity class that implements the IEntity interface. I've also found reasons why this pattern makes things more difficult, as the article states... changing Id to a GUID for instance. Or worse is having an class with GUID as Id type, and others as int as Id type. I've never really found a better way, other than just saying the repository can use any class...e.g.; public interface IRepository&lt;TEntity&gt; where TEntity : class { } vs... public interface IRepository&lt;TEntity&gt; where TEntity : IEntity { } where public interface IEntity { int Id { get; set; } } public class BaseEntity : IEntity { public int Id { get; set; } } used in public class Person : BaseEntity { } public class PersonSqliteRepository : IRepository&lt;Person&gt; { } I've struggled with this mentality a lot, on one hand it seems like a lot of overkill. On another it keeps my models cleaner, and ensures my repositories are only on classes with an Id property. I've also just removed the IEntity interface, and used the BaseEntity by itself. Which seems to work fine too. note: I only use this for working with data in a database, while not using EF. I am disappointed that this article states the issue, but not a recommendations for a solution. Does anyone have a suggestion of a better way to do this? Is just hardcoding the Id property in models and having the IRepository interface use any class the solution? Or dropping the IEntity interface and keeping the BaseEntity class?
Right off the bat, using Id as the name of your primary key is an anti-pattern. A lot of problems can be avoided if you name the primary key on your `Person` table `PersonKey`. Also, the pattern doesn't allow for compound primary keys. If you have a `SupplierProductMap` table, then you want your primary key to be `SupplierKey+ProductKey`. So what does support this? The `Key` attribute. [Table("SupplierProductMap")] public class SupplierProduct { [Key] public int SupplierKey {get;set;} [Key] public Guid ProductKey {get;set;} public bool IsPerferred {get;set;} } 
&gt; bitbucket bitbucket is a git based solution
&gt;Motherfucking cool multi-platform UI framework. Gotta be honest - that kinda puts me off from the beginning. It doesn't make it sound like a serious project that will be maintained into the future.
Thanks for the feedback, you may have a good point. Anyway "that particular phrase" is just an experiment, but the project itself is damn serious. We are a development company with 15+ years in the market. This project is the evolution of previous closed-sourced projects we did during these 15 years so theres a lot of goodies in the project. Please take a look at the code, or even better install the nugets, or download the repo, you will not be dissapointed. Docs and codebase will be growing almost on daily basis by 3 of our full time developers.
Are you going to post your source?
&gt; Right off the bat, using Id as the name of your primary key is an anti-pattern. A lot of problems can be avoided if you name the primary key on your Person table PersonKey. Can you explain? Why is this an anti-pattern, and what problems are avoided by using PersonKey rather than Id?
Bitbucket supports git and mercurial. However Bitbucket was originally a mercurial only service and added git support later on.
Lets say you want a projection showing people and their phone numbers. SELECT p.PersonKey, p.FullName, pn.PhoneNumberKey, pn.PhoneNumber , pnt.PhoneNumberTypeKey, pnt.PhoneNumberType FROM Person p INNER JOIN PhoneNumber pn ON p.PersonKey = pn.PersonKey INNER JOIN PhoneNumberType pnt ON pn.PhoneNumberTypeKey = pnt.PhoneNumberTypeKey If you use id instead, you get this: SELECT p.Id, p.FullName, pn.Id, pn.PhoneNumber, pnt.Id, pnt.PhoneNumberType FROM Person p INNER JOIN PhoneNumber pn ON p.Id = pn.PersonId INNER JOIN PhoneNumberType pnt ON pn.PhoneNumberTypeKey = pnt.Id Right off the bat, you have three different meanings for the variable `Id`. Which means you are going to have to alias them anyways. SELECT p.Id, p.FullName, pn.Id as PhoneNumberId, pn.PhoneNumber, pnt.Id as PhoneNumberTypeId, pnt.PhoneNumberType FROM Person p INNER JOIN PhoneNumber pn ON p.Id = pn.PersonId INNER JOIN PhoneNumberType pnt ON pn.PhoneNumberTypeId = pnt.Id Looking at your C# code, now you have some classes that refer to the primary key of `PhoneNumber` as `Id` and others as `PhoneNumberId`. Besides being confusing, you may run into trouble when using libraries such as AutoMapper. Then look at the `WHERE` clause. Again, we see that `Id` has multiple meanings and that your foreign keys necessarily have different names than the primary key they reference. 
Article doesn't mention that today, you will typically do this with Func&lt;int,int&gt; Local = i =&gt; I+1
Sorry for the typo, that should have read `SimpleModelBase`. EDIT: I really should move ModelBase to the internals namespace, as you'd never use it directly. We're happy with the functionality, but clearly we need to improve the API design so that people don't stumble onto the wrong path. EDIT 2: Maybe rename `ModeBase` --&gt; `Internals.ModelBaseCore`. Then rename `SimpleModelBase` --&gt; `ModelBase`.
It should be pointed out, you can't make this recursive without some gymnastics. And I should be the one to point it out.
&gt; username checks out
1. Syntax is better 2. It can be recursive
Exactly my thoughts. However I think he purposefully chose a function with iterator blocks which I think are not allowed in lambdas.
Not very hard though. You just split the declaration and assignment.
Death to all repositories!
He is technically correct which is the best kind of correct.
You can use `async` lambdas: Func&lt;Task&gt; foo = async () =&gt; await Task.Delay(100);
You can use async in lambdas: Func&lt;int,int&gt; fn = async x =&gt; x + 1; I think that's how it's done ^
Empty interfaces could help simplify things like IoC registration for DI. 
Yes, we would need to see what you have first in order to make suggestions on what might be something good too add
True, sorry about that. I currently have tabs, navigation buttons for forward, back, refresh, home (though home is not customisable), I kind of have history, but I am not happy with it as it only records the inputs into the search that the user makes, not all the websites that have been visited, and a loading bar. 
Definitely TopShelf! It is designed to install console applications as Windows Services and is really simple to use. It takes away a lot of the headaches of working with Windows services and the fact that you have already written console apps makes it a no brainier!
For whatever reason (maybe it's the weird syntax? or the perf hit?), I don't think this is actually that common. I think declaring a private helper method that's called only once happens much more often.
Thanks for the feedback. Please consider that there will always be tradeoofs in any multi-platform strategy. We deciden to compromise "the construction of controls" in order to make the library very simple, if you take a look at the code, its very short and simple, easy to mantain. Also agree on XAML, in fact a XAML designer is a planned feature. But for now this is good enough to release the project to the world. Please consider that there is no other open source alternative that acomplishes this much with such simplicity and little code. MVVCROSS for example, requires you to work a bit on every UI for every platform, and our library does not. Best regards
What do you need bitbucket for if you're running your own server?
https://bitbucket.org/product/server
Entities shouldn't go anywhere near your IoC container.
For a UI framework I want to see some images in the github readme. Show me why I should download it.
Linq to SQL is fucking awesome, i watched a 10 minute youtube video and could do any query that i wanted. As long as you know linq already there is a very small leaning curve. And if you dont know linq already then its a great thing to learn.
But you gotta be edgy like Facebook!
And do you honestly think that is good or nice code?
What I dislike is that you first assign null to it, just to overwrite it immediately with another value. I know it is necessary to make it work, but that's what makes it bad code too.
All you actually need to turn your console app into a service is a class that extends ServiceBase (in the framework assembly System.ServiceProcess). You can add one in VS by right clicking -&gt; Add -&gt; New Item -&gt; Windows Service Then add a public (or internal) Start() method to your service that calls the service's protected OnStart() method. You can then call Start() from your Program.cs, as described [here on how to debug a windows service](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2629741). Bonus points: use either [NSSM](http://nssm.cc/) installed with [Chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org/) (so that NSSM is in your PATH), or Powershell's [New-Service](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh849830.aspx) and [Start-Service](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh849825.aspx) to get your service up and running
Agreed, images are coming, thanks
lambdas are ok for some things, but rapidly deteriorate in readability as the complexity of the algorithm increases. For example here is a joint binary search done with nested local functions and tuples: https://gist.github.com/bbarry/031a1cd89f8b602312da#file-locaterange_snippit-cs
I've written a bunch of Windows Services over the years and hadn't heard of TopShelf. Implementing a Windows Service isn't that tough. Maybe TopShelf is an awesome library, it definitely has some support from the first few replies here, but I'm always a fan of having fewer dependencies if possible/reasonable, so I'd skip it and implement the service by extending ServiceBase.
It should just work, as the default mode is serialized. http://sqlite.org/threadsafe.html EDIT: Oh hey, this doesn't look good: &gt; SQLite, version3, does not allow multiple write operations to come from different connections. It will output “SQLite error (5): Database is locked” in the debug console if that happens. http://www.mintycode.com/post/58816954126/multi-threaded-access-to-sqlite-using-c-and EDIT 2: Intellitrace is seeing the errors, but the data is still being saved and I'm not catching any exceptions. I think there is some sort of auto-retry logic involved. That said, it would probably be a good idea to use a global ReaderWriteLock.
you explanation is pretty confusing. what do you mean by 'readable by another program'? why are you using rich text boxes?
I still haven't found a better pattern for when I have a data layer that uses both dapper to access SQL and RavenDBs SDK to access my raven instances. When the data starts to be spread between different databases, repositories make things a LOT easier. Especially testing / mocking.
Well thanks for taking your time to contribute your input, but if that is the case that it should mostly work, why am I seeing these exceptions? I would venture to guess that it has to do with this line of code. var db = new SQLiteConnection(this.connectionString) Trying to get a lock on the database file. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
I've written a couple of windows services with and without Topshelf and I strongly suggest you to use Topshelf because it makes really easy to deploy and debug the services. I must say that I am never going to write another windows service without using Topshelf :).
Well you'll need to learn SQL databases before you can learn Dapper. So do you have any sort of background with SQL databases?
This. There is no need to add a dependency like top shelf which will limit you and only save a dozen lines of code.
Dapper doesn't really do anything besides map the results of your query (stored procedure or raw SQL) to a collection of objects. It's claim to fame is that it is crazy fast.
I don't know, but I can't reproduce the issue on my side. It's really annoying too because I'm working on a mini-ORM (between Dapper and EF on the power/speed curve) and I want to make sure I cover this case. Here is my test code. Let me know if you are doing anything differently. https://github.com/docevaad/Chain/blob/sqlite-demo/Tortuga.Chain/SqliteTest/Program.cs
The benefit of local functions is that it allows you to break method logic down into easily composed parts while maintaining lexical scope and preventing class pollution. They're also more performant than delegates. Finally, they lend themselves very well to representing recursive algorithms.
Yes. I am very familiar with SQL and related data - mainly in Access, SQL Server and I've dabbled in some Python and more recently C#. I have no problem writing SQL and I've gotten Dapper to work for me with basic relations but I'm not really grasping how to structure my models/methods to get the results and functionality I want. I am just working with raw SQL in my code at the moment and have not gone near creating any SPs yet. I was trying to get something like [THIS](https://scotch.io/tutorials/a-guide-to-using-eloquent-orm-in-laravel) example working, but I think that I am coming to realise that maybe I'm expecting a little too much from Dapper. I thought that it would be possible to map a list of objects to a property of another object (items and the related item details) and I have gotten this working to some degree (for example, returning each fish and the bear which owns it). Would something like this example (in its entirety) be very difficult to get working? Are there any other ORMs that would be a little more like SQLAlchemy or Eloquent without being as heavyweight as EF? I think that Dapper is maybe just a little too low level for me at the moment with my current knowledge of C#.

Try: if (!query.Any) return;
not program sorry. I plan to write the back end in Javascript and use OCR alongside it (or something like this). All it needs to do is be able to open file then allow the user to enter the values which updates and then the user saves the file. 
It's a program for a mod. It just makes it easy to have a user interface and allows them to update a file. I'm not sure on the richtextbox just used from a tutorial I saw. As long as it outputs the values into the box after you click a button then the user saves it. 
Alright, so hard code the values in first. Do you have any recommendations for anything that requires information to be output to it? Regular text box do this? Is SQLite close to MYSQL at all? I've never actually seen the panel or worked with it. 
Need it :(
Am I the only one that finds this idea a horrible one? Do people no longer follow one class one purpose programming where if you did have a public method and a private only called from that method they would be the only things in the class and be stupid easy to understand? This looks like it will enable bad programmers and be abused terribly to me
Local functions also does not create a closure but still has access to the declared scope.
But that's not concise. And yes, I do not like MEF either. I'm not a fan of property injection, which seems to be the favored method with MEF. An object should get everything it requires to work in the constructor.
Thank you :)
I see your point(s). I've always kind of been against including class names in property names. Seems redundant, but see your points nevertheless. My question remains though, how would you structure a simple person repository. I'll give you the base example here, i'm curious how you would modify it. Clearly there would be more to it in a real world, but hopefully includes enough to provide a point (yours). Appreciate your input, am always eager to see what others do. Please note: this offer is not limited to /u/grauenwolf, i'd be curious to see what anyone would do. Starting example: http://pastebin.com/vN11yHci **please note: I used https://dotnetfiddle.net to create this, so couldn't write the unit tests. A simple console app will have to do.
Having known Pascal, I am in favour of this, it *can* get handy. But it really is a rather trivial syntactic sugar, just like so many things coming out recently for C#. I think that whoever think "lambda" ([and there seems to be many](https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/48so18/c_7_feature_proposal_local_functions/d0m6n5f) should think twice. Performance characteristics are **wildly** different.
Using Topshelf is it possible to add a wpf window or form to the service. I would like the service to be able to update the config file of the clients if possible.
Not every tool is for every job.
Only if you maintain a one-to-one mapping between classes and tables. Once you start looking at more interesting data structures that falls apart. For example, I often have two tables behind a single object. Here is an anonymized version of real code from my current project: public async Task&lt;Foo&gt; UpdateFooAsync(Foo foo, int currentUserKey) { if (foo == null) throw new ArgumentNullException("foo", "foo is null."); if (!foo.Validate()) throw new ArgumentException("foo is not valid " + foo.ValidationMessages(), "foo"); //security check here Foo.Stamp(currentUserKey); using (var transaction = Dispatcher.BeginTransaction()) { await transaction.UpdateModel("dbo.Foo", foo).ExecuteAsync().ConfigureAwait(false); await transaction.UpdateModel("dbo.FooBarMap", foo).ExecuteAsync().ConfigureAwait(false); transaction.Commit(); } return await GetFooAsync(foo.FooKey, foo.BarKey, currentUserKey).ConfigureAwait(false); } 
From http://sqlite.org/threadsafe.html: &gt; The threading mode can be selected at compile-time (when the SQLite library is being compiled from source code) or at start-time (when the application that intends to use SQLite is initializing) or at run-time (when a new SQLite database connection is being created). Generally speaking, run-time overrides start-time and start-time overrides compile-time. **Except, single-thread mode cannot be overridden once selected.** Emphasis mine. Maybe your dll has been compiled with single-thread mode. Then it's expected to see those exceptions. 
"John Sharp" :) 
An interesting way to do this, I've never seen someone use this before. This would be an SqlBaseRepository of course, but i assume would require some tweaking to be testable. Thank you for sharing this. It's always nice to see how other people achieve the same ends to a mean. You say you dislike the repository pattern (as a few others have here as well), what do people use in its place? I normally only use it when i'm not using EF on a project or have data access via something other than sql (i.e.; api, flat file, etc). I will admit most my projects are small and 1:1 class to table references. When i get PK/FK involved heavily I tend to switch to EF (assuming SQL as my datasource). 
&gt; You say you dislike the repository pattern (as a few others have here as well), what do people use in its place? I start with "service" classes that represent a logical grouping of functionality. These start out pretty broad, usually at the schema level (SQL Server's term for namespaces). For example, I would have HRService, SalesService, and InventoryService. I prefer to use an RPC style approach. Rather than having generic calls such as `OrdersRepo.Get(filter)` I would have `SalesService.GetOrdersByCustomer`, `SalesService.GetUnshippedOrders`, and `SalesService.GetReturnedOrders`; These might return `List&lt;Order&gt;`, but more likely they return custom objects based on what the caller actually needs and nothing more. This is really important when it comes to performance. You can't use techniques such as covering indexes when you are always returning every column in the table.
And how do you imagine this to be implemented if not the same way? I mean they do create a closure if they capture the parent scope (this is what closure means)
&gt; That's usually what private methods are for No. Private methods are for methods shared by other methods in the class. This is a private implementation detail of a recursive method. &gt; Especially when delegates/lambdas can achieve exactly the same thing Except lambdas create a closure, and any captured variables are moved from stack space to heap space, meaning local variables suddenly can cause a processor cache miss and needs to be dereferenced before use. It also creates GC pressure. Local functions can also use yield return, lambdas can't and probably never will. &gt; There may be the rare case where it syntactically looks better but not only is it subjective but now you have a new feature that every developer now has to grok This is a really, really simple feature to understand. Everyone will say "You can have functions inside other functions now?". That is everything you need to know. &gt; adds complexity and error surface to the complier and may get in the way of the engineering of future features or their backwards compatibility. The cost/benefit just isn't there. D has this feature, and although you won't use it often, you really miss it when you do need it. I would argue that this is a really simple feature.
&gt; Just to be clear, is this what you are looking for? Yes, that's exactly what I have done. I then have a method of Fish called GetBear to return the Bear related to Fish, which seems to work fine for now. I'm having trouble going any further however. class Fish { ... public static IEnumerable&lt;Fish&gt; GetBear() { string strSQL = @"SELECT * FROM Fish f INNER JOIN Bear b ON b.Id=f.BearId "; var data = AppDb.dbConn().Query&lt;Fish, Bear, Fish&gt; (strSQL, (fish, bear) =&gt; { fish.Bear = bear; return fish; }); return data; } }
I don't use the new Microsoft Edge (internet explorer) as my main browser, but a nice feature is the Bing look-up. When you highlight some text, bring up the context menu and click "bing look-up" a side-bar appears displaying search results without opening a new tab/window. I cannot actually find this feature right now on my work computer but I just upgraded at home and I thought it was nice.
&gt; That's the goal of Chain, but we're not quite ready for prime time. Ok, looks interesting. Is it usable at the moment at all? I did a quick search there but couldn't find anything about it. 
The SQL Server data source is usable (though incomplete). We're still working through bugs in the SQLite data source. It's actually a reimplementation of a ORM that I've used for years, but was previously unable to release publically. https://github.com/docevaad/Chain/tree/master Our goal is to have the 1.0 version ready within 3 months.
&gt;No. Private methods are for methods shared by other methods in the class. Haha, I think that 'No' is a bit much. You only create a new functions for the purposes of code reuse? They're used for both but I would say most of my private functions are only called in one place and they exist for readability and organisation. I don't think having those functions within other function would help that encapsulation, if anything it would make the functions more cluttered and get in the way of future reuse. Class namespace pollution isn't really an issue, classes just shouldn't get that big. &gt;Except lambdas create a closure Are you sure local functions won't? They have access to the enclosing function's scope, will local functions not be able to be passed outside that scope? How is that ensured? &gt;Local functions can also use yield return Fair, that would be handy. &gt;I would argue that this is a really simple feature. Feature creep is definitely a thing. Unless there's real productivity increases what's the use? I'm happy to admit that Eric and the other languages designers are much smarter and have their reasons for adding this, but as it stands and in the context of this article I'm not there. EDIT: To add: &gt;This is a really, really simple feature to understand. While the feature itself is easy there will inevitably be a whole new set of rules and best practices around which feature to use and when. Different devs will have differing opinions and not everyone will know the details of why each is better for a particular situation.

Check out IRegesteredObject. Implement it and then call HostingEnvironment.RegisterObject in your global. Your can do whatever you want in there and then IIS will call stop on your object when the app pool is shutting down so that you can safely stop.
Would a Windows service do the trick?
It's not annoying because that is not useful. If you need to assign to a delegate use lambda or delegate functionality.
I generally think people should use the filehelpers library instead of trying to build their own csv parsers. In a real world use case, many Csv files include quotes and escaped commas in their data and a naive csv parser will get thrown by this. Additionally, new lines in values will throw this parser off. 
I've tried this before and regretted it because it's not reliable. The process is started by IIS and can shut down anytime. You can finagle some things to keep the process from shutting down, but if IIS restarts, there's no guarantee your app pool will start right away until the first request comes in. Like someone else here mentioned, a windows service is the correct way to go.. hopefully you have a host which allows you to run processes outside of IIS
It's not meant to be a replacement for anything.
&gt; Haha, I think that 'No' is a bit much Yes i agree. But still you always want to scope in any member as closely to its usage as possible. Sometimes it makes sens as a private method, but sometimes it does make sense as a local function. &gt; Are you sure local functions won't? They have access to the enclosing function's scope, will local functions not be able to be passed outside that scope? How is that ensured? You can't assign a local function to a delegate. If you could then local functions would mostly be syntactic ~~sugar~~ salt for lambda or delegate expressions. &gt; Feature creep is definitely a thing. Unless there's real productivity increases what's the use? Feature creep is more a issue with non-released software. You want new versions to have new features, and this features is conceptually very simple. And there are productivity and performance increases to be had with this feature. Imagine you have a state machine. The state of that state machine needs to be processed, and either you use a reference type to keep control of the state, which most people don't, or you use local variables, which is after all the most effective way. Imagine that you have to clear set of these fields (state, currentValue) and multiple states can end in a clear. Either you use goto, or you just type out the same thing over and over. Or you create a closure, but I've already explained the disadvantaged of that. With local functions you can have a local `Reset()` method, or a `SetState(a, b)` method that allows you to assign multiple fields in a single statement, and it can even contain logic if you need it, such as dispatching a `StateChanged` event or whatever. Currently that kind of code is *cumbersome* to write.

Hangfire.io is incredibly easy to setup, use, and deploy. The dashboard is top notch, it has automated retry, error logging, persistent tasks, etc. Give it a shot.
Thank you 
There are a lot of Windows devs (and sysadmins, and DBAs) who use Macs and then run their software that requires Windows in one or more VMs. In part because of the hardware. The reality is if you were to go the Mac route, you'd be doing this unless the job explicitly called out doing .NET development w/ mono or Xamarin. Most shops don't let developers pick any random computer they want in the first place; they'll have a handful options available and you get to pick (or you're assigned) one. At most, you might get to pick which model from a particular manufacturer (my whole company is standardized on Surface Pros &amp; Thinkpads, but which Thinkpad you get depends on your job). RealSoonNow^TM , you'll see people doing server-side development on non-Windows platforms more often as .NET Core &amp; related stuff gets more mainstream.
Using it for a couple of products, love it! 
Thinkpads are great. As long as you aren't buying the low end crap. We're all in with Windows and don't do a lot of in house development. No chance. 
Can you explain a little more about what the application does? There may be other solutions.
We use XlsIO, DocIO and several pdf conversion tools. XlsIO seems pretty good with a decent API for what it is doing. The only issue I have noticed is the method `IRange::AutoFitColumns()` throws if it fails; but there doesn't seem to be any reasonable way to recover from that exception (If you cannot auto fit, you simply cannot auto fit: too bad)... So the way to use this method is: try { range.AutoFitColumns(); } catch { } Admittedly we use XlsIO less than everything else in terms of lines of code, but it does everything we need, profiles well, and doesn't appear to have significant memory leaks. The pdf conversion tools work somewhat... they appear to leak memory under several conditions we haven't taken the time to determine (or at least hold on to it too long). And they only work in STA. In order to get around these limitations the pdf conversion stuff is built into a command line tool we execute as a separate process when a pdf is needed. DocIO is frustrating. A word doc could almost certainly be processed by some sort of visitor pattern that simply returns new nodes if the nodes need to be changed much like the way the Roslyn compiler is designed. And yet the api is littered with read only properties that I want to assign to. Instead of assignment I call some method to do whatever graph mod I need, but the method tends to have undocumented side affects (example: adding a comment node to a paragraph will remove the style for the paragraph sometimes). Ultimately we have working code, but it is filled with comments like this: //see bugzilla 35097: adding this save line makes the text area issue go away; I don't know why... doc.Save(TempFileName(".docx")); We use some recursion to set some values in the api that are not public (ex: `WField::FieldEnd`). There appear to be some memory issues in this library as well, but again we are invoking it as a separate executable via `Process.Execute`.
&gt;Feature creep Excuse me, I meant software bloat. Using a class seems ideal for managing a FSM's state. Why are local's more effective, what advantages does this approach have over using a reference type?
Waitall 
It's not common that you can choose unless you are in a small firm. Usually you'll have to fight for admin rights too if you're in a big corp. But FYI. Don't ask this at a job interview, in the way you did here. Unless you wouldn't want the job if you had to use windows. If I were hiring you, I'd assume it meant that you had trouble adjusting to environment changes, and that'd be a really bad trait when I evaluate you against others.
All of my colleagues are using macs with a VM for Windows. I'm the only guy with a not-Apple-laptop.
Yeah, as a .Net developer if I hear somebody complaining about "having" to use Windows that's an immediate nope.
I also use XlsIO extensively. Unfortunately for me their new versions have completely horrible performance, and old libraries have other bugs. So for now I'm staying with some 2012 version with IL code patched, while sending performance repro cases to Syncfusion for newer versions. They do a good job of providing patches in time though, a week tops.
Some people like to support the people that spent a lot of time making the book, though. 
Sure, here it is : private async Task PopulateVehicleImage(Vehicle vehicle, Action&lt;bool&gt; success) { if (vehicle != null) { await GetVehicleImage(vehicle, (result) =&gt; { vehicle.ImageSource = result; }, (code, message) =&gt; { string alert = string.Format("Error ({0}) - {1}", code, message); } }); } } And here's the actual GetVehicleImage: public async Task GetVehicleImage(Vehicle vehicle, Action&lt;string&gt; success, Action&lt;string, string&gt; failure) { RestClient client = new RestClient(string.Format("{0}/VehicleImageService/{1}", Constants.APIBaseURL, vehicle.Vin)); RestRequest req = new RestRequest(Method.GET); client.ExecuteAsync(req, (response) =&gt; { if (response.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.OK) { VehicleImageResponse result = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;VehicleImageResponse&gt;(response.Content); if (result != null) { vehicle.ImageSource = result.Image.Uri; success(result.Image.Uri); } else { var result = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;VehicleImageResponse&gt;(response.Content); string code = result.Error.Id; string message = result.Error.Description; failure(code, message); } }); } } 
And the downloadable books have been pretty good in many cases. For free controls of this caliber, I'll take a rare email.
How does this deal with all the edge cases such as: `"Somebody", "Hello there "Somebody", how are you?", 1000`
For the next month or three, this will probably be true. But this will all be changing with .net core and VS Code. 
Had my W510 in a backpack... which I then ran over with my pickup truck. (Don't ask.) I had to replace the screen. Everything else was good.
Yeah I haven't run your code yet but it would appear that it should break in some places if it were to behave like mine namely it would break on the first call from WriterNoLock to get an instance of SQLiteConnection. It helps to know someone got it working though.
That's why I'm asking, I wouldn't want to work on Windows but it's a personal thing. 
This is the way to go barring some product that does this for you. Use topshelf and you will find most of the work of making a service done for you, you just need the timer and db logic.
I disagree. That guard clause example cannot be written with a switch block. It is evaluating several different booleans. I agree that in most cases a single return is better, but in that particular example the style using multiple returns is easier to read and maintain.
Honestly, it'll be quite a while yet until those are the majority. Visual Studio is incredibly powerful with .Net code and most companies that use the two are members of Microsoft's developer program, meaning they pay annually and get their software as/when it comes out. I don't see anything except greenfield projects switching to .Net core for at least a year or two.
I'd say that it's pretty unusual to work on a non-Windows machine. It's totally done in some cases, but it's the exception rather than the norm. For most jobs that utilize C#, you can expect a very Windows dominated workplace, if not 100% Windows. At my workplace, we only have Macs for building for iOS (with Xamarin) and for testing Safari. They're not really used for development with C# and nobody would do so since you need Visual Studio. There's no real replacing VS since related technologies depend on it and nobody wants to deal with supporting more than one build system or anything. It's just easier if all the devs use the same platform and same software for building and such. Not to mention that Visual Studio is unmatched as far as IDEs for C# go. It'd be unusual to want to use a different OS simply because it'd be viewed as shooting yourself in the foot where development tools go. Even more so if your workplace pays for tools for VS.
&gt; client.ExecuteAsync It doesn't look like you await this call so GetVehicleImage is running to completion without the actual web request finishing
Sorry I assumed that since the function name was ExecuteAsync it would return a task (which is the naming convention for async methods). Try looking at the ExecuteTaskAsync function, that returns a task
Trying to patch over encoding issues by fixing individual characters will fail the moment someone uses a different symbol that you didn't think of, and will only lead to more headaches down the road. Find out how to configure whatever database client you're using to correctly decode the data as UTF8.
&gt; I'm constantly using online material (ebooks, tutorials, video series, etc) but I feel like I need a solid physical book to go to the next level &gt; use the countless free resources you have available on the Internet for C# Some people prefer to have a book to be fair and I'm just asking if anyone had any recommendations or guidelines on what to get. You have taken your time to reply with a salty response and chose not to give a constructive answer. Cheers. &gt; Like Pragmatic Programmer, Clean Code and Clean Coder. Fair enough, but I feel like I need to have a better understanding of C#.
I'm writing a minimalist e-commerce site as a side project to teach myself ASP.NET 5. The database will be hosted as part of a 'Core' WebAPI service that I will consume in a yet unwritten front-end.
Why do you need to check the database every 20 minutes? That seems like a strange requirement. If you explain it, maybe someone can suggest a better method than doing that.
Starting point: Undergrad in STEM - preferably Comp Sci. This makes a *big* difference when recruiters are going through the filtering process. MS Vendor Certs are good, and demonstrate a commitment to the Tech Stack and your craft. I credit value to these, they are not easy. Cert Scrummaster - nice, but not a huge value PMP - this is tough to get and valuable if you are acting in a management role There are few other certs that I consider of value. If you were to complete postgrad classes (an online Masters in Comp Sci) I'd be impressed. If you're looking for very senior positions then throw in an MBA with a technical side (Georgia Tech has an MBA in Management of Technology) - this can *really* help.
Sqllite is quite capable of being used with normal use websites. Have you looked into using something like structuremap to manage the session connectivity?
Doesn't matter. The author has already been supported. Maybe they want to can't can't. 
Haven't really gotten that far though if we're talking about the use of IoC frameworks I'd go with the one that comes with ASP.Net Core. The problems I'm have are occurring during Unit Testing of my repository.
If you asked that in an interview, I'd disqualify you as having no real-world programming experience.
Same here. A web service is not the place for long running background tasks. My team made that mistake years ago and we're still paying for it and trying to refactor it away.
Lucky for you, the recent decision by Microsoft to move into open source has led to the release of the [.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io/) which can be used on Linux and Mac. You can also check out [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) that is a cross platform compiler. It was being used prior to the release of the .NET core. 
But why, WHY did you started to learn a language developed by Microsoft, for Windows, if you hate it? Why not choose Java, for example? Really, I can't get it, and you are the second today - you hate something and start to use it for no apparent reasons, and in the meantime try to find a solution which will make your learning like ten times harder, while you have other choices as well... (Saying this as a C# dev)
I don't disagree with any of that. However, new .net projects on mac an linux won't be using VS Community, since it doesn't run on those platforms. But VS Code does.
I chose the language because I am more interested in Game dev. and I saw the C# can be used with Unity. 
Unity uses a community built implementation of the .NET library called Mono (hence Monodevelop). Mono is cross platform to Mac, Linux and about 4,000 other OSs, which is why Unity uses it instead of the Microsoft built core. If you only hang out in Unity then you should be fine with deploying and developing onto other platforms, but once you stray outside of Unity you are in for a world of hurt, because traditional Windowed business apps in Mono are a pain and a half. One more thing: please don't just use Unity if your goal is to boost your skills as a programmer. Unity development pipelines do terrible things for reinforcing bad programming habits. (I.E. No constructors, interfaces are basically non existent). I don't mean to be that guy, and if it were just to have fun and learn a couple of things then Unity is fine, but if you are doing it as a serious method of studying application architecture, I would move past Unity for now.
You could remove all non-ascii characters. Might not be ideal, but could strip out the unexpected characters. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/123336/how-can-you-strip-non-ascii-characters-from-a-string-in-c
I hear ya, and mostly agree. Hell, I'm supposed to be writing C# on my Windows machine right now. I'd prefer to work on Linux/Mac but it's not a deal breaker for me.
The studio I work in is a Unity shop and we all work on iMacs.
.NET Core will not be a good choice for at least a couple of years. Very immature, lots of things missing.
SQL isn't cool anymore. I know a lot of developers who think they're somehow "above" SQL. I have no problem with the various ways of abstracting SQL: they're really good most of the time. But there are times when you have to get "dirty" and look at the SQL. Some of my best days at work involved SQL. Modifying a query that takes forever and seeing it run instantly because you found a better way to do it (or added an index, or whatever) is so incredibly gratifying. You almost never get those kinds of quantum leaps in procedural code. I can understand some of the dislike for SQL: it's verbose and old-fashioned. But a good developer who does anything database-related should have a good foundation in SQL.
There are valid reasons to limit your career. Like being happy, building a family, having principles...
I dont plan using Unity to teach myself for programming I got a book for C# and I plan to learn it from it.
&gt; I have never worked with C# so 
In the relatively near future they'll probably be using JetBrains' new C# IDE, which they're calling [Project Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) at the moment.
I don't think it is the end of all programming I just think it is superior. And I am the kind of person who sees the programming language as the most important thing in the toolchain. I don't care if the OS is inferior, I don't care if the IDE is inferior, I don't care if the web server is inferior. I take pleasure in writing code and I enjoy how well designed the language is (I do read on programming language design in my free time). I treat the other parts of the toolchain as just tools. I don't care much about them. Maybe someone finds pleasure when he looks at the power of git or feels moral satisfaction from working with FOSS technologies. Not me.
&gt; And I am the kind of person who sees the programming language as the most important thing in the toolchain. Of course, to each their own. Personally, the ecosystem is vital. I wanted to make iOS and Android apps. Yes, I could have used Xamarin, but it's always going to be inferior to the first-party, native solution. So I'll use Swift/Java. Same with playing around with AWS Lambda - it requires (well, did at the time) writing in Node, so I'll write in JavaScript. But hey, there's room for all of us in this industry.
Yeah. I do write JavaScript (lately TypeScript) because I must do it for a web project and I do want to create actual products but I will go for Xamarin if I want an Android or iOS app. However Swift looks good (and quite similar to C#) so I might choose it for an iOS only project. It is true, there is room for all of us and this is why I understand the guy who may not want to use Windows the same way I don't want to use other languages.
When you were a hardcore gamer wanting to make the next Quake or Everquest killer, then you take sides while blasting the shit out of your preferred platforms rivals. But when you actually become the CRUD application developer in the real world that you were probably meant to become, you realize that limiting yourself to your fanboy platform is a waste of job opportunities and a limiting factor in getting your application spread wide and far.
No, he didn't. C# isn't the only language out there. I know many programmers with lots of real-world experience that have never used C#.
The release of cross platform C# will take a long time to be adopted.
Others have commented on RestSharp usage, for me I ended up moving the call to the app on start event which downloaded my data in the background when the splash screen was displayed. Some ideas for you to look into though.. Move that RestSharp call to a generic where you can specify the URL, method and class you want RestSharp to use. (I'll paste code if you need it when I'm off mobile) Dynamically load the images when the view is displayed, is that an option rather than downloading all the images first? 
I never would have guessed you loved UI design /s You should come hang out in the [C# Discord](https://discord.gg/0np62rq4o8FHMFlp) and teach us the ways of design. Most of us are doing the coding equivalent of drawing stick figures while suffering from Parkinson's.
I'm convinced the people at JetBrains are sage wizards, cornering the IDE market so terribly well
Well, yes, but this may help change things soon. https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/
That's why I stick with console applications, haha. Quality of life improvement
It's all I write, primarily because I'm more interested in backend and terribly uninterested with designing pretty UIs

Tried it out and it seems to be working now. Thank you so much for your help!
I've written hinders of services. Ive never personally found any of of it has ever been awkward. Actually if you follow the official way of installing removing the service your 100% correct. But there are better ways to deal with those two issues. 
Here... Take a look at my sample project that self hosts. You could add anything you want to this and it would work. Keep in mind that your service code should be separate from say your windows form, (they can co exist in the same assembly if you want) as services are restricted by default to be back ground processes. As others have said services are just classes that implement the ServiceBase class. The added ServiceInstaller I have in my project does exactly what top shelf for installing and removing and does so without the extra bloat... https://github.com/jcanady20/TestBench?files=1
No. That's why designers have a job. Coders like myself are horrible at knowing what colors look good.
I actually think SQL is amazingly compact. The only thing that even comes close in terms of correlating various bits of data is LINQ...
Visual Studio VM on a mac? I would never hire that person. I dont hire people that dont know what they are doing
With Microsoft's purchase of Xamarin -- I suspect while they will ship cross-platform, the development device will become even more firmly Microsoft Windows. 
P.S. I just posted the Nuget packages so you don't have to deal with downloading and compiling source.
Sounds interesting... Any real world examples of apps created with the library?
Yes, but if you cant buy it for whatever reasons you might as well pirate it. If you can afford to then you should
That's so dumb. That applies to anything haha. "I can't afford this game at Walmart so I'll just steal it." However, if your friend buys it and ends up not liking it, he can give it to you. You didn't pay for it, but it was paid for. 
Removed: Rule 7. Potentially Rule 2.
Format code by inserting 4 spaces before each line (or clicking the "code" shortcut in the text editor) using System; using System.Windows.Forms; public class myHour { public static void Main() { DateTime t = DateTime.Now; int h = t.Hour; string str = ""; switch (h) { case 0: str += "It is six Twelve O\'clock now!"; break; case 1: str += "It is One O\'clock now!"; break; case 2: str += "It is Two O\'clock now!"; break; case 3: str += "It is Three O\'clock now!"; break; case 4: str += "It is Four O\'clock now!"; break; case 5: str += "It is Five O\'clock now!"; break; case 6: str += "It is Six O\'clock now"; break; case 7: str += "It is Seven O\'clock now!"; break; case 8: str += "It is Eight O\'clock now!"; break; case 9: str += "It is Nine O\'clock now!"; break; case 10: str += "It is Ten O\'clock now!"; break; case 11: str += "It is Eleven O\'clock now!"; break; } MessageBox.Show(str); } } Also, can you clarify your question? _"How can I show just case 6 in the executable?"_ doesn't make sense to me.
Web scraping can be a pain. I've tried a few options, but so far I've found the [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Selenium.WebDriver) automating a Firefox window to be pretty easy to program and fairly stable. You should be able to have the page JavaScript execute and get an updated DOM. I think you can use it to drive Chrome too, but I've only used Firefox with it.
Resubmit a direct link to the article rather than the blog wrapper and we'll let it through.
will look like is posting duplicate things, I do not post more! Congrats!
&gt; I am disappointed that this article states the issue, but not a recommendations for a solution. I think the article is suggesting, and I tend to agree, don't create marker interfaces or base classes for your entities. Don't create generic repositories.
VS doesn't always correctly determine that you've eliminated the error. But if it's not working at all, it could be the project file got messed up somehow. Weird things can happen. Can you try cleaning and then rebuilding, and then see if it's working? Also closing and reopening the project will sometimes fix weird bugs like hat.
Good stuff! I should certainly follow suit and learn something like WPF, but then I have no current use for the technology so I'll probably put it off until I have a good project in mind. Although I code for fun rather than as a career currently.
I've installed Visual Studio Community 2015 but I haven't gotten around to using it yet.
I tried everything I could think of (including what you suggested). Restarted VS, started it in safe mode, reset all settings, disabled all extensions and more. In the end I gave up and tried a hard reset by deleting my VS folder in User/AppData/VS14, then deleting some regedit entries and then opened it in safemode again and it started up as totally fresh First-Time instance of VisualStudio. It's now a pain to re-install everything but it seems to have fixed the problem.
AdaptiveTriggers... Setters in VSM instead of discreteobjectkeyframes?! i gotta make the transition from WPF to UWP. This comment is useless i realize
Services run as Local System, typically, which doesn't have UI privileges. Consider this: if multiple users are logged in to the machine, which desktop does the service display the window on? Best approach is to use WCF (maybe named pipes) and have a local WPF app that talks to the service as needed.
dat speakkkerrr hummmmmm looks like a cool project though! you said you dont know a lot about c++, was that just misspeaking or did you do part of the server side in c++? edit: by the way, your login method. It looks like you want to do something more like if(string.IsNullOrWhitespace(userText.Text)) instead of .contains("") this will check if for nulls, empties, and whitespace in a string. or .IsNullOrEmpty for alowing whitespace. looks like brushing up on the basics such as how string comparisons work may be useful, but it looks like youve got the basic logic flow understanding. keep at it man!
I miss-spoke. when I noticed I put an annotation into the video saying C#. The entire project will be C#. I have a lot of c++ knowledge from a few years back when I used to do a lot of d3d menus in C++ for Combat Arms dll injected hacks for things like wallhacks and aimbots though. and yeah I am getting over the standard cold everyone gets at this time of year lol if i could edit out the few coughs that slipped out, I would. And the fish tank in the background..... sounds like i sit in a bathroom xD
You can modify the foreign key in the database to cascade deletes, no C# necessary.
How do I make sure that when a delete a row in the join table it wont delete a row in the primary key table? Or does cascade delete only work if I delete a row in the primary key table?
Read original post
no generic support(or weak generic support, even with XAML 2009 which doesnt support WPF) styles arent nearly as powerful as they could be with true abstraction terrible text editor and designer support in visual studio, for years now. I dont use the designer as anything more than a preview surface, but it barely works for that horrible value caching system for the XAML preparser clunky syntax, very verbose, everything is very ass-backwards. Id prefer a more QML-like approach with a C# hybrid. Im sure a lot of this is not the best practice but ill heres some examples of cool features it could have. //reference the stuff you want #include "MyProject.ARealCLRNamespace" #include "http://www.axamlnamespace.com/ns" #include "apreviousfilewithsomeresources.ext" // defining methods for object creation without MarkupExtentions %function Brush RGBMacro(byte R, byte B, byte G) =&gt; new SolidColorBrush(Color.FromRGB(R,G,B)); %function MultiBinding Bind(string path, RelativeSource relativesource, ...) {...} // defining constants and static resources #define Brush @MyBrush = RGBMacro(34, 56, 67); // &lt;- this uses a macro/function #define double @fixedArithmetic = 5.0 / 9.0; #define Style @myStyle1 = new Style { .TargetType: Grid; Setter { Property = Width; Value = 42; } } // one single visual root element, like an XML document. but JSON like. Creates a grid with two chained styles Grid::myStyle1,anotherStyle{ .ColumnDefinitions { ColumnDefinition { .Width: 20px } ColumnDefinition { .Width: Auto } } .Background = @MyBrush; .Height = @fixedArithmetic - 1.4; // &lt;-an arithmetic computation inline VisualChildNode { .Property: new ComplexType("Creating something with a non-parameterless constructor") } } You could have support for everything that XAML does now and far more without making a multiconverter or ivalueconverter for every tiny binding task by using conversion expressions. Multiple inheritence and true abstraction on WPF styles, it could be incredibly powerful and expressive.
The projects I tend to work on have very little need of a nice UI to go along with them, thus why I have neglected to learn WPF or WinForms. It is possible to do pretty much anything in a console application: menus, drop-drowns, et cetera. Often with cleaner code and less XAML or whatever the forms technology uses for it's boilerplate. There's a very... genuine feel to a console application. You can look at the code and if it is well written, you will know what's happening immediately and with a few clicks of F12. With forms you've got the frontend, the backend, the boilerplate, other resources (if there are any). What a stupid rant I just had. It's pretty much personal preference. If you're good with WPF it is certainly in one's interest to work with it; I find myself more driven to console applications, though :)
&gt; Or does cascade delete only work if I delete a row in the primary key table? Yes.
Yeah I definitely understand you, I'm currently only using winforms because my teacher is asking me to make apps that use winforms and later on I'll move over to WPF although I can't tell you about it much because I don't know myself but I love working in console. The one thing that annoyed me with console was just having to make a lot of loops and sometimes even use gotos which was very tedious for me but I still overall love console apps. 
It depends... if you do Xamarian, Mono or Unity development you can do it as well on a Mac, Linux in addition to Windows. But if you do Windows 10 Apps or classic ASP.NET development you will do it on Windows. However ASP.NET Core is the way of the future for backend development and it will not be confined to Windows, see VS Code.

One of my coworkers uses a mac and is a senior c# developer, he uses Visual Studio through a windows virtual machine
If you are asking about samples (including layout and control ones) they are on GitHub - https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples There is a package to install layouts as VS templates but I cannot remember where. Now this would not make your app unique but will help with layout issues. The old metro had the nice feature that as long as your app had images it became pretty but this trick does not work so well with the new hamburger bullshit. Still depending on your app it is worth a try.
Thanks but since the offer I could avail of was due to expire soon, I ended up ordering 'Essential C# 6.0'. From what I gather, it's pretty decent and a very thorough, big book. Thanks for the input all the same and I'll probably pick up one of the more general ones later on when I have a good understanding of the language itself.
IIRC, you need OS X to sign anything going into either of Apple's App Stores, so cross-platform developers will need non-Windows systems around.
OK.
Please dont emulate other platforms designs on Windows 10.
Did you try deleting the obj folders after a clean?
 using (var conn = new SqlConnection(dbConnectionString)) { conn.Open(); // A few hundred lines, including what I've posted. I realise I probably should break up my // code into manageable chunks but I'm still learning. } // END using (var conn = new SqlConnection(dbConnectionString)) I'll try this in the morning SqlCommand cmdDelete = new SqlCommand(); Thanks
&gt;winforms app You'll want to do anything you can to keep it that way
It wasn't limited to one project. It was in the Visual Studio itself. Anyways, I did figure it out and fixed the problem after wasting 2 hours.
Good idea. Done.
IMO you should also use a Logger e.g. [Log4net](https://logging.apache.org/log4net/index.html) library. Logging is an indispensable part of my code. In it's absence, debugging is like hell.
That didn't change the fact someone try to tell other party how to run their business.
It sorta sucks for me because I always look at gui code and think... there's really got to be a better way to do this. Then again my first experience with gui programming was with Java.
Am i alone in thinking the windows 10 app style looks bad?
Read the first couple sentences
Could you please elaborate, because I can use VS for pretty much every language I want to use.
Ouch. That sucks. By any chance, did you try creating a new project and seeing if it happened in there before you reinstalled VS? Just in case it might have been merely the project file.
You could simply use a stored procedure that deletes all the relevant rows. So instead of putting in a cascade delete on the foreign keys, just call the stored procedure. 
Getting a 404: Page not found
i definitely agree with that, and i like the general look of it, i just dont care for the store apps style. id rather a Material Design for Desktop type thing. Some MD stuff doesnt make sense for desktop but i think a lot of it translates directly over.
Well, you can make your setup however you like it to look. Visual Studio is in WPF and I think it looks highly professional and works very well.
That's your opinion. Not gonna stop people from doing it :)
Yea I know. Reddit ignored a few of my new lines there. Good thing each line is easily broken up by semi-colon :)
Tried that and it had the same issue. :(
What's wrong with VSTS? I'm still new. 
Mostly the answer to that question is nothing, and if you've got an MSDN licence using it today is really kind of a no brainer unless you're heavily invested in an existing CI environment. The issue however is that this is a recent development. Prior to the 2010 release it was essentially unusable, and if you need a lot of off line support git was only added in 2013. The new build system which fixes a lot of the remaining issues only released July last year. TFS is probably on par with or better than any other build system you can find, and it's getting better. It's not been that way for very long though and if you've got a conservative work environment or your environment is managed in a way which doesn't match your needs or both you've never seen that. 
I do this fairly regularly. Two things.... 1. VSTS tracks a workspace location, which is the location of the folder on your machine. If you change that folder, you need to unmap it and then remap it at the new location. This may mean that you need to move it back to unmap it and then move it back (that could be as simple as just recreating the folder). You unmap via source control explorer by clicking on the path link at the top of the tool window. 2. There are a lot of path references in sln, csproj, and other project files. You most likely need to update path references. They can be relative paths, so those may need remapping too or will need to be converted to absolute paths. A big challenge here is that the files will be readonly if they are under source control. After you've finish step one and remapped your workspace, you can then check out your project and solution files from source control explorer. Make sure you edit the files with notepad (or equivalent text editor that isn't ever - for the life of God - wordpad). Good luck
You're calling [this overload of `Console.Write`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ttxecb1c%28v=vs.110%29.aspx). The various `Write` and `WriteLine` methods only print out the _first argument_ provided to them. Instead of passing in each part of the output as different arguments, concatenate them together into one big string instead: Console.Write(i.ToString() + " + " + m.ToString() + " + " + c.ToString() + " + " + x.ToString()); C# is also smart enough that you don't need to use the `.ToString()` calls either here. You can simply put: Console.Write(i + " + " + m + " + " + c + " + " + x);
I do not see how they explain anything. My point is: XAML is central to WPF. If it is bad, WPF is bad by a very simple extension. (I do not think that XAML or WPF are bad, just that your argument is).
What I've done in the past is create a parent class with the shared columns/keys, then let any company (in your case) related entities inherit from that. Warning though you can't use that parent class anywhere as an entity or nav property or ef will error when trying to build the models in context 
Sorry about that, I picked the wrong time to reorganize my site's URLs.
What use are the plus signs? Console.WriteLine($"{a} {b} {c}"); 
They're part of the output string.
I wasn't familiar with the CGEIT / ISACA tracks. Thanks! 
You're attempting to access GUI controls from a background (non-GUI) thread. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1523878/getting-cross-thread-operation-not-valid Other than that, this is removed due to Rule 4. Please put some more effort into diagnosing and solving issues you come across. This is a good example because simply googling the error message with _"winforms cross-thread operation not valid"_ yields almost 20,000 results; this is a well known and often-encountered error that is very easy to fix.
I used to do that but I figured I wanted to learn to use the tools provided, in case. But thank you.
Interesting. Thank you.
Databases aren't really my gig: I've worked with Oracle and SQL Server, but almost exclusively in a C# dev capacity, not as a DBA. Anyway, I would wager that this is a property on the database or table, not on your connection or session. (Do some googling on SQL Server collations.) From some trivial searching, it sounds like SQL Server is probably using UCS-2 instead of UTF-8. Also double check the settings for the application or system that is putting data into the DB, which might also be the culprit. (See [this article on storing UTF-8 in SQL Server](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/232580) for some pointers on ASP/IIS and converting UCS-2 to UTF-8 and vice versa.) Text encoding gets kind of fiddly. This sort of thing usually means that *something*'s not configured right.
By "mapping class" I meant some static methods to translate between entities and models
ah ok. Well, that's already assumed. I'm not dumping entity models out to views. One method of mapping I already mentioned in my question, which is the adapter classes. 
You could do all of that, or you could just use the [Color.Lerp()](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.graphics.color.lerp%28v=xnagamestudio.31%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396) function.
Why would you want Android look on your Windows app?
Not sure about the question but are you asking how to set h to 6? int h = 6;
because in my opinion windows store apps look bad.
Run the server process in a new thread/task.
The assignment asks you to use "*an* application class *of your design*" (i.e. a class that you create to contain the logic of your application), not *the* `Application` class. Presumably you've learned how to create classes before you were given this assignment, otherwise refer to the [stickied help thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/3xn6sm/welcome_to_rcsharp_read_this_post_before/) for resources.
Awesome... I've been wanting to use protobuf in a UDP project for awhile.
I can't offer much as far as the GUI goes, but as far as dynamically creating chat rooms and having specific users being able to talk on them - you probably want to take a look at the Observer Pattern or Publish/Subscribe. Your Chat Room instance(s) is going to hold references to each User in the Course. All Users will need to see when a message is sent to the Chat Room by a single User. The Chat Room class will also need to be able to handle different events like Subscribe, where it will add Users to the list of User references it currently holds. As far as dynamically creating new chat rooms, you could hold a Static/Singleton list of Chat Room instances for every new Chat Room per Course (if I'm understanding that requirement ok). Just stay cognizant of thread safety if you take that route.
Why the heck is this down voted
Run process in a thread? Wat?
Well... What is the practical difference between XAML for silverlight, WPF, UWP!? As for WWF, the similarity between to "XAMLs" stop at the file extension and "it's XML"
The syntax for the main method of declaring visual trees for use in a ui framework like WPF being shitty doesnt automatically make the whole ui framework shitty
It does when it is so prominent. **Nothing** in WPF is done without a fair amount of XAML. To repeat myself (again), I don't mean this as a stab at either XAML or WPF, but at yout argument.
I started writing a language that crosscompiles into XAML then into BAML a few months back. Its not far along enough to use for some things, but i use it a fair amount. And if i knew enough about BAML i could bypass XAML completely. 
People can think what they like, but their thinking might be more or less appreciated by others :-). That said, yes, same thing. HTML is too big a part of the stack. If it sucks, then the stack sucks. Maybe the whole sucks less than the worst part (which, as we all know, is actually JavaScript :-)), but sucks nonetheless.
Ok, so you have "creator's bias" then - since you have "your" baby, other babies aren't as good :-).
Pretty much all human-solvable puzzles are made so that at any point in solving the puzzle, there is only one next logical step. Trying all possible solution or trying a solution and then backtracking is not part of the process of solving those puzzles. This usually means looking for patterns and basing the next step on those patterns. The more advanced the puzzle is, the more advanced techniques to find the patterns are required. Just look at [Sudoku](https://www.kristanix.com/sudokuepic/sudoku-solving-techniques.php). So programming solvers to such puzzles usually means encoding those techniques inside the program.

Because this library is opinionated, and hides some functionality which can be undesirable in some situations. There is a sacrifice to pay for simplicity. For example I am opinionated on how to create the streams, and also the support for GZIP is outside the scope of the original protobuf. We must be careful to differentiate between bloat and features. If my things were part of the original protobuf, I'd argue it would tangent bloat and not feature.
I see your point.
Can you provide a sample json file and an example of how you would like to be able to call your method?
Interesting! That does seem handy, like using a static function but without having to use a whole heap of ref parameters. Consider me convinced. Cheers for your patience :)
Some ideas: With http://www.newtonsoft.com/json dynamic dynamicJson = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(json) With your dynamic object you can iterate it for the field name you want http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2594527/how-do-i-iterate-over-the-properties-of-an-anonymous-object-in-c Anyway, you're making it quite hard for yourself. It would be much easier if you could tell the JSON parser where to look for your value. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21678126/parse-json-string-to-find-and-element-key-value
Yep. The purpose is to make it more F#-like!
&gt; What is that even for? Slightly more suspicious ref type? It's way to late to introduce a null-type. It would have to have had CLR support, but that is not practical. &gt; From what the article says, it seems about equivalent to what Resharper does in regards to null checking (especially if you use annotations). The intent is to make verifiably null-broken code uncompilable.
Yeah it's supposed to loop and listen for incoming messages.
I guess you could. For his case though I don't think it matters, he still has to iterate all the fields in some ugly fashion.
I actually came across this recently and it made sense to me. The base class does not know of the derived class's newer implementation of the properties. The new keyword hides both class's implementation from each other. I noticed this problem when I tried to touch on the derived class's new modified property from a base class method. The solution was to keep any code that needed to use the property in question in the same class. Moving that method to the subclass and then calling it from the base class seemed to work fine. If you need to access the base class's properties then, I think, you can use 'base.propName'. 
Yes, but you don't have to use reflection, and instead have some well defined interfaces (JToken, JArray, etc).
I usually pass form instances through method that have InitializeComponent(); inside. Main form: &gt; namespace FormsTalking { public partial class MainForm : Form { //Define second form private SecondForm secondForm = null; public MainForm() { InitializeComponent(); //Create second form and paste this form info secondForm = new SecondForm(this); //Show second form secondForm.Show(); } } } Second form: &gt; namespace FormsTalking { public partial class SecondForm : Form { //Define main form MainForm form1 = null; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Initialize SecondForm /// &lt;/summary&gt; /// &lt;param name="_Form1"&gt;Form1 instance pointer&lt;/param&gt; public SecondForm(MainForm _Form1) { InitializeComponent(); //set Form1 pointer form1 = _Form1; } } } You can access all public things that way via form1 on SecondForm or secondForm on Form1, this also works with WPF. I hope that you can understand what I wrote since my C# thing naming is very bad 
Java for one, but outside of C# other editors do have better support for various languages than VS (even though VS supports them). Things like build tool integrations, version control(maybe it's just me but GIT handling in VS just doesn't feel natural) etc. For me I use Intellij for most if not all my stuff, because majority of my day is spent in JS nowdays and Intellij has strong support for it. So having something I can do C# inside the same environment is very beneficial for me. At the end of the day I firmly believe work with what you're comfortable with, and I have nothing bad to say of VS at all, other than when I have to use C# I need to use windows :/ lol
You're right it can't, so either you pass it as an argument or you store it somewhere else that's accessible.
I'm using TailBlazer for viewing my logs during development and I think it looks great. https://github.com/RolandPheasant/TailBlazer It does use the Metro UI which isn't everyone's cup of tea but I personally think looks really nice. I know the author posts on here. 
Small changes in cache processing such as you've posted can lead to some unforeseen performance penalties. If you're running any kind of load, I'd run it through a performance analyzer even if it seems like harmless wrapper code. It's just the right thing to do. I noticed a jetbrains annotations namespace in the code base (which not all coders will have). If you have a license to jetbrains ultimate, you could run a basic test with something like dotTrace and dotMemory. I would encourage anyone to do so with their implementation, but you doing it helps us all when the creator has initial numbers. This C# codebase might help you see how your wrapper to protoBuf impacts the numbers in an unbiased way. You could also see how it compares to doing an implementation with MsgPack or Thrift. https://github.com/sidshetye/SerializersCompare Always nice to see more people getting into the distributed and IMDG cache arena. 
Whatever works and feels right to you. Also yes that's supposed to work.
Thanks! I'll check it out.
Thanks for the help. I'll be sure to play around with it to see what works best.
If performance becomes a concern, [Cap'n Proto](https://capnproto.org/) might be an option (the name is silly, but it's from one of guys that worked on Protobuf at Google.)
It's the increment-operator: - https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/36x43w8w.aspx - https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xzcawzfw.aspx You can achieve the same result by writing this: clusterCounts[clusterID] = clusterCounts[clusterID] + 1;
Haha, that's a bit cheating ;) but quite interesting. I'm of the opinion that ProtoBuffer was primarily designed to be used in a caching solution, due to it's insane deserialization speed and small size. And then it does have to be stored in some way often. Wish we could just have our entire infrastucture in RAM..
**edit** I just noticed you said local intranet, in that case UDP broadcasting is definitely your best bet, I'll leave my other answer below in case the scope of your project changes... TCP always requires an IP. The solution you could use is hosting a server with a static IP or on a free DDNS service that will map your changing IP to a domain name. You can resolve it through there. UDP broadcasting rarely works, it's almost always blocked by the router, and when it does it has to be on the same subnet as the machine you're connecting to. If you're looking for something that's always going to work you need to have a server whose IP can always be resolved, then use that to map client IPS that change
I actually had a suggestion for pattern matching, but it was rejected with zero interest. I'm glad someone there saw the value in it, though. It would be a huge addition.
I am using windows credentials as default. It was settled on the visual studio wizard. And during the SQL Express installation it settles windows credentials as recommended.
The reason you're not getting any responses and have been voted down is that you're making no attempt to solve the problem yourself, but expect someone else to do it for you. If you had tried it yourself and ran into difficulties with a particular part, this subreddit would be a lot more responsive. Edit: fixed typo.
I had a quick look at https://github.com/Trindaz/android-google-image-search from post you mentioned above. All that seems to do is call Google's API (see https://developers.google.com/custom-search/) using an HTTP client. There is an example in C# here - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14880921/steps-for-using-google-custom-search-api-in-net.
&gt; and how could I possibly test an entire code base without unit tests giving me some level of confidence? It’s not possible without a concerted effort. Yet it needs to be done. Putting a band aid on it is far worse over the long run. It leaves a landmine for others to step on and the bad behavior becomes increasingly harder to correct over time. I know making major changes without safety nets can be scary, but with practice you learn how to do them with a surprisingly low risk of failure.
Usually when your property was created first and then the base class added its version.
How you convert a Java example to C#: 1. Read a line of Java code 2. Look up what it does 3. Write a line of C# that does the same thing 4. Repeat until done If there's a specific method or api or something you don't understand then ask questions. But all you've done is provide a link and ask for someone else to do all the work. Android is primarily Java and you're going to have to get used to it. You won't find C# answers to a majority of your questions going forward. You need to work with the community, not demand they go out of their way to provide exactly what you need. 
"It is six Twelve O\'clock now!"; Umm.
&gt; Oh I see, thank you and /u/Xenoprimate very much. It kinda threw me off because it was ++clusterCounts[clusterID] instead of clusterCounts[clusterID]++ which is what I'm used too. That is a pre-increment operator, which would use the incremented value in any assignment for example. The one you are used to is a post-increment operator, where any usage of the value would be before incrementing. So: var a = 1; var b = ++a; Results in a being 2 and b also being 2 However: var a = 1; var b = a++; Results in a being 2 but b being 1. The use of the pre-increment in standalone examples, is usually a throwback from older C based languages (and possibly CPU architectures) where the pre-increment was more efficient. The C# compiler/JIT is smart enough to turn a post-increment into a pre-increment if it is beneficial for performance.
The primitive types are partially implemented directly in the runtime, and the compiler makes exceptions for them. This would not be be valid code for anything else, but the primitive types have to come from *somewhere* after all to avoid the chicken and egg situation. The `[Pure]` attribute indicates that the method does not manipulate the state of the object, and may be used by analysis tools to improve their understanding of the code. 
So `[Pure]` is equivalent to pure functions like in Haskell? 
You want to look up how to use the google custom search API, make a request from google, and parse it. Here are the docs: https://developers.google.com/custom-search/
I'm strangely torn between (1) thinking most of the new features / proposed features I'm hearing about are neat ideas; and (2) thinking that the language is changing too much and too quickly. There just has to be something wrong with that. Doesn't there?
The latter.
Got it! For the usual reasons overthinking came into play here. I kept overthinking how delegates work. Maybe some day I'll get the hang of them. This response pushed my mind back on the right path this morning. Thank you!
Not really an option in this case.
Yeah VS and Office 2016 are two examples for beautiful Windows applications. (But I don't think it runs on WPF, I think just 2010 did and 2012-15 probably run on DirectUI like Office)
Serious question. I haven't really worked with tuples so I'm not sure on this, but why wouldn't I just make an object that contains all the types I want to return and then return the object?
&gt;nItems = 3 That's going to set nItems to 3. &gt;for (int total = 1; total &lt;= itemAmnt; total++) There isn't a {}, so it's going to be doing this line once for each itemAmnt: Console.WriteLine("\n\nDo you want to enter more purchases? - Y or N? "); If you're just trying to get the item count, why not just use itemAmnt? Unless you're trying to calculate the total purchase price, in which case you still need to prompt for that price. What you might do instead of asking if there are more items, just ask: What is the amount of the item, or enter 0 for none. Then end the loop when they have entered 0. What is the amount of the item, or enter 0 to end. read amount from console while amount &gt; 0 increment number of items add amount to total purchases prompt again for the amount of the item or enter 0 to end wend calculate shipping based on items print receipt I also suggest using tryparse instead of parse, otherwise it can crash. 
The world is getting weirder and weirder. 
Works for me!
Adapt or die. Ask HP, Sun, IBM, Digital Equipment, etc, etc. etc. 
Is this real life?
They wouldn't do it if they didn't have to imo
Just FYI I use http://regexr.com/ over https://regex101.com/ for c# regular expressions
Is this scheduled for release on April 1st?
Microsoft has been contributing to the kernel for decades. The sky hasn't fallen yet. Right now their strategy seems to be 'use us too'. They know their days of owning the DC are over and they don't want to be shut out the way they were trying to do to everyone else back in the day. An environment with some Microsoft products is better than one with none. It also makes sense from the perspective that a SQL license is much more profitable than a windows one and their biggest competition in this space is from a company that people loathe on a scale which dwarfs even the most ardent free software proponents hatred of Microsoft. 
You should try F1 some day. Then later you can try advanced techniques like Google
I'll try it some time.
I fail to see why you're paranoid. If anything, this just ensures that Microsoft will have a bigger user base to work on their product.
Thanks, I really appreciate it.
also to people that have resharper, it has a great regex validator.
Hey i know I'm late but thanks for this! i love that i can come back to this post and finally understand what your talking about after a few weeks of learning. I'm reeeealy banging my head on classes at the moment.. i will try to implement what you described an maybe it will help.
I suspect Dot Net Core, ASP.Net and Entity Framework being available for Linux may have something to do with this
Ok figured it out, it may be a little messy but it works :) static void Main(string[] args) { double itemAmnt = 0, nItems = 0, sCharge, tax, gTotal, sTax = .0775, tPurchase = 0; string answer; bool quitProgram = false; Console.WriteLine("This application computes the total due for your purchases."); Console.WriteLine("It will allow you to enter any number of purchase amounts."); Console.WriteLine("When you are finished entering purchases, it displays the"); Console.WriteLine("total due including sales tax and shipping charges."); while (quitProgram == false) { nItems ++; Console.Write("\n\nWhat is the ammount of the item? "); itemAmnt = double.Parse(Console.ReadLine()); tPurchase += itemAmnt; Console.WriteLine("\n\nDo you want to enter more purchases? - Y or N? "); answer = Console.ReadLine(); if (answer != "y") quitProgram = true; } if (nItems &lt; 3) { sCharge = 3.5; } else if (nItems &lt;= 6) { sCharge = 5; } else if (nItems &lt;= 10) { sCharge = 7; } else if (nItems &lt;= 15) { sCharge = 9; } else { sCharge = 10; } tax = tPurchase * sTax; gTotal = tPurchase + tax + sCharge; Console.WriteLine("_______________________________________________"); Console.WriteLine("\t\tSales Receipt"); Console.WriteLine("Total Purchases: \t\t{0:C}", tPurchase); Console.WriteLine("Sales Tax: \t\t\t{0:C}", tax); Console.WriteLine("Number of Items Purchased: \t" + nItems); Console.WriteLine("Shipping charge: \t\t{0:C}", sCharge); Console.WriteLine("_______________________________________________"); Console.WriteLine("Grand Total: \t\t{0:C}", gTotal); } } }
Nope. It's a /r/fantasea
This. If the flow analysis is anything like what Resharper does, then it's could be somewhat error prone in certain circumstances, which would make trying to use this in certain places that use things like reflection pretty much useless.
This is my class. namespace PROJ_06_MRC_V1._0 { public class ShippingCalc { const double standardCatA = 3.00; const double standardCatB = 1.45; const double expressCatA = 4.00; const double expressCatB = 2.50; const double sameDayCatA = 5.50; const double sameDayCatB = 3.00; const double standardSurcharge = 2.50; const double expressSurcharge = 5.00; const double sameDaySurcharge = 8.00; public double itemNumber { get; set;} public double StandardSurchargeA() { return standardCatA * itemNumber + standardSurcharge; } public double StandardSurchargeB() { return standardCatB * itemNumber + standardSurcharge; } public double StandardNoSurchargeA() { return standardCatA * itemNumber; } public double StandardNoSurchargeB() { return standardCatB * itemNumber; } public double ExpressSurchargeA() { return expressCatA * itemNumber + expressSurcharge; } public double ExpressSurchargeB() { return expressCatB * itemNumber + expressSurcharge; } public double ExpressNoSurchargeA() { return expressCatA * itemNumber; } public double ExpressNoSurchargeB() { return expressCatB * itemNumber; } public double SameDaySurchargeA() { return sameDayCatA * itemNumber + sameDaySurcharge; } public double SameDaySurchargeB() { return sameDayCatB * itemNumber + sameDaySurcharge; } public double SameDayNoSurchargeA() { return sameDayCatA * itemNumber; } public double SameDayNoSurchargeB() { return sameDayCatB * itemNumber; } } } 
What is value of itemNumBox.Text?
I'm having trouble getting that to work.
I'm not asking about its meaning, I'm asking about its value.
text box input
"text box input" is not a double value. Double value is set of digits and special symbols.
that's why i parse it 
This is my updated code but it's still not working postage.itemNumber = double.TryParse(itemNumBox.Text); Where can I find out how to fix it?
[Read the documentation ](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.double.tryparse\(v=vs.110\).aspx)
thanks i figured it out
I see no need for IIS. With Owin, the web server shouldn't matter that much. Regarding Visual Studio, I couldn't agree more.
Visual Studio Code might be the missing link there, not sure if it would be the intermediary step or the start of the final destination. 
DirectX on Linux... Oh man, now I sweating and drooling. That would be the most awesome thing to have! And, well, it would mostly kill windows. In, like, two months :D Biggest drawbacks of linux: there are only some games available. If directX would work on linux, then there would be incredibly huge amount of games available for linux, and that would make a lot of users to change.
[Behold: documentation!](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/az24scfc%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) Go forth and read, and become enlightened. First hit from googling 'msdn regex'. 
That's new information to me, so thanks for sharing. I have received a pull request with changes to this. Is that you? I gave a comment there regarding this. Quoted below Refer to here https://github.com/ebergstedt/ProtoBuffer/pull/1#issuecomment-193695357 &gt;I realize now that the "FromByteArray" and "ToByteArray" would not need async, due to it being extremely fast. I believe the Microsoft guidelines for making methods async is when they take more than 50ms. &gt;But I think SaveToFile and FromFile could profit from being async, if we wrap the "File.WriteAllBytes(filePath, byteArray);" and "File.ReadAllBytes(filePath);" in their own async context. File transfers can be slow, and they could definitely take more than 50ms. &gt;We could use FileStream.WriteAsync and FileStream.ReadAsync for this. &gt;What do you think?
Maybe both, but I'd think the bigger push is that it's a large customer base that they'd gain access to. If you get a lot of devs using sql express when they're learning, and then those guys go on to become higher level devs, they may be more apt to buy sql enterprise, where it may simply have not been a option before hand. As someone who's worked with a lot of different frameworks and db bank ends, when cost isn't a limiting factor, I'll always choose .net and mssql. The development and management of them is just too nice.
Heh, for each example I was thinking "oh, no, do it like this", where "this" was the next tip. I guess I'm not a Junior developer any more (good to see my 10+ years experience wasn't wasted)
I think project rider is the replacement for VS.
It would kill Windows for you and I. The majority of people will stick to Windows. I shudder to think what most people would say if I tried to teach them to use the CLI.
Its fast, easy to use, and flexible. There are so many odd things you'll have to consider with csv. But it was mainly a joke, there seems to be an alternative library for everything abstracting the core functionality to make it 'better'. 
Caught in a landslide...
But to get DirectX working on windows, I imagine either it'd replace xserver (mir/wayland,ect) and need to have a comparable window manager. Not saying they couldn't do it, but they'd either need to get a big name like Ubuntu to affiliate with Microsoft (more so than now) to make it cost effevtive or make their own disrto. I'm curious if they'd ever go that way.
&gt; public override void OnBackPressed () { base.OnBackPressed (); } I figured that out before ^^ Thanks anyways tho!
That'll work, so I'll give you some stylistic suggestions. Move the pile of if/else into a function. It takes one parameter (nItems) and returns one value (sCharge). That makes your main code easier to read. You can also move the contents of the while loop into its own method. Parameter would be tPurchase and the return would be tPurchase+itemAmnt. This, again, makes code easier to read. Steps like that separate logic (tPurchase += itemAmnt, how nItems and sCharge are related) from program flow (while loop for input, then output the results). This allows much faster means of manipulating what something does OR where it does it with far less chance of messing up something unrelated. I'd also recommend cleaner variable names. Thank you for not using hungarian notation (prefixing names with variable type, such as `int intNItems = 0;`) but you can just call it totalPurchase or itemsCount or shippingCharge. It makes it easier for others to review because they don't have to remember which one is shipping charge (or that the 's' means shipping). Next step is to object orientify the whole thing! Create a class that holds the values and does the calculation and the main function just does the input/output console stuff! But I'm getting ahead of myself; just ignore me.
Lol, no your suggestions makes sense. I just didn't have too much time to clean it up. Working a full time job with a 1 year old and taking 3 classes a semester is starting to catch up to me. 
No, Linux has Vulcan and Vulcan drivers on all platforms would be better. Less fuckups from NVidia and AMD
I can barely manage a full time job and an 18 month old, heh. I wasn't sure your particular skill or familiarity level. I offered some of the basic organizational, rather than functional, tips that come later on in the process.
I appreciate it :). We are half way through this semester and it is my first programming class since I took Fortran about 18 years ago....gah I'm getting old lol.
Well, they are also in the process of officially partnering with Xamarin. Xamarin Studio cribs heavily from VS and runs fine on Mac OS. Considering how slow and unstable VS 2015 is on my Windows box, I'm not sure which one will eat the other.
Not partnering. Microsoft bought Xamarin. 
Ideally ask questions related and commonly used in coding solid C# apps. In my examples below, I think most inexperienced people will fumble most of them, and experienced people will answer them all or almost all easily. GitHubs and projects of theirs they are proud if is also good. Example questions: &amp;nbsp; 1. What does the using(var a = new Blah()) {} do. 2. What is the difference between a structure and class. 3. What does static mean/can a static class be initiated.. 4. What is the Difference between interface and abstract class. 5. What is the difference between the Dispose method and the GC. 6. What is a method overload. 7. What is a method override. 8. How does passing a param as ref work differently than passing it as a normal param? 9. Show an example using the out option in a method? 10. Show an example of a small class you would want to implement the IDisposable interface on. &amp;nbsp; My opinion is a worthless drop in the bucket from a probably jr level coder, but if it was me hiring a C# dev to help myself I would care more about the candidates basic core C# skills both in code and standard practices, such as design patterns, as well as their understanding of OOP code &amp; .NET framework practices (like unit testing). &amp;nbsp; I could care less if they didn't know how to use git like a seasoned github master, nor if they know every obscure super-specific question, or even if they can nail whiteboard challenge. I'd much rather hear in response to a tough question "Actually, I'm not sure how that works (or how to do that / etc), I've not done it/used it yet. I'd have to research it a little." than an elitist who hides or deny's their lack of knowledge. 
&gt; I could care less if they didn't know how to use git like a seasoned github master [...] I'd much rather hear in response to a tough question "Actually, I'm not sure how that works (or how to do that / etc)" Yeah, the point of my "follow this tutorial" question isn't so much whether they know git as to test their ability to follow written instructions -- which is important because of the time difference. We've had a lot of problems with some other India people needing a lot of handholding / not even attempting to follow the written instructions because they're afraid it'll ask them to do something unfamiliar, and handholding on India time means someone (either here or there) has to be at work late in the evening. And yeah, having them comfortable saying "I don't know" or "I need more information before I can do this" is another biggie.
&gt; Definitely don't use git as a metric to measure them My using a git tutorial as a question isn't to test their git abilities (the tutorial assumes zero prior knowledge of git); it's a test to see if they can follow written instructions on an unfamiliar subject :)
Please look up *Covariance and Contravariance in Generics* in your favorite C# book or the documentation.
&gt; Finding a programming language they are not familiar with is a bad idea. Why exactly? I'd rather have someone with a solid ability to think through things at a conceptual level, and who can translate a problem into whatever set of concepts/abstractions are available, than have someone really good at C# but who panics and stops being able to understand algorithms if they're written in a slightly different way. In my experience, the "one language wonders" tend to also be the ones who struggle with debugging when their debugger of choice isn't available. For example, there was one guy who got completely stumped on a bug because he couldn't get the Visual Studio debugger to attach -- he spent 2 working days *just* working on trying to get the debugger to attach; uninstalling and reinstalling Visual Studio, trying to install the remote debugger, etc. ... when just putting in a couple of print statements or temporarily writing log output to a text file would have revealed the problem in a few minutes.
Definitely avoid that last question. I know what you're trying to accomplish there, but many people get genuinely stressed out in an interview situation, and this could be a stressful situation that doesn't allow them a fair shot. And people learn different ways - some like to view video tutorials, others like to read a book, some sit down and start trying to code. This favors one learning style over others, and doesn't show you anything holistically. It just shows you who is really good at hacking things out. Trust me, this does not correspond with the best developers you will encounter. Many times it corresponds with the worst. Your other examples are pretty good, but asking for code examples and documentation may not be a good idea - many times their best code will be under NDAs or other closed licenses and it doesn't give them a fair shot. I like showing candidates existing code that has some/many issues. First, we fix the issues. Then, we improve the code together. Then, we work on improving the documentation (do they know the comment-based documentation using xml tags?). I then ask how this code might be implemented differently in a language they list on their resume, and if we have enough time I'll get them to code it in that language, with the expected style (e.g. procedural or functional, instead of OOP). Maybe we'll also write some unit tests, or maybe we want to switch to some new API. Using existing code allows it to be a two-way conversation and gets you on an even playing field, and gets them in a zone they should be familiar with. As far as language trivia, others have donated good suggestions, but honestly I get little value out of those sorts of questions. It's a lot easier to figure out a good programmer by putting them in touch with code, than asking them what a certain keyword does. It's not unreasonable to ask those sorts of questions, but you won't really understand where a candidate's strengths lie based on that.
gotcha, that's easy enough then. I'm still a fan of that user's comments I mentioned, they're a pretty decent set of questions
If I'm understanding your problem correctly, I'd say you want a negative look behind at the beginning of your pattern. A negative look behind does what it sounds like: it looks behind your pattern and makes sure that what comes before it doesn't match. In your case, you don't want to match something if there's a . directly in front of it. Add this to the front of you pattern and give it a try: (?&lt;!\.) You can read more about postive/negative look ahead/behind here: http://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html

* Show me examples of documentation you've written Professional coder for around 10 years, I hardly ever write any kind of documentation for my code. What sort of documentation are you expecting them to show you? Also if it was documentation for my current job, well that's the property of my employer and they probably don't want me showing their stuff around :) * Show me examples of code you've written Again, I can talk about that code, but would you expect them to come in with source code from another company because you can't do that and I don't code in my spare time. * Here is a tutorial (installing and configuring git for our standard config [edit: this assumes zero prior knowledge of git; the test is whether the applicant can follow written instructions]); share your screen and follow it, or critique it if the directions are unclear This seems mental. * Here is a block of C# code that's wrong. Tell me what's wrong with it and why it doesn't work, or show me how you would debug it to determine the problem. This is normal. * Find a programming language he's never worked in, and ask him to write "hello world", then expand on it. (I think language-independence and not getting intimidated by new things are the mark of a good programmer.) This seems even more mental. IF I went for a C# job and they said write Hello WOrld in Ruby or some other language. I'd ask if I was expected to use that language, if they said no I think I'd do the hello world challenge to show I could and then leave. That seems absurd. What's wrong with the normal sit with them at a computer with whatever IDE your company uses and ask them to write some code to fulfill a requirement. Make it relaxed, give them access to Google, books etc (you want to replicate the work environment as best you can), talk with them as they are working and try to find out whats going through their head during the processs. Make them do it using TDD if that's your thing. You could then give them a piece of broken code and ask them to fix it, like you said. THen you have some C# specific language questions. * What are sealed classes * What does the protected access modifier mean * Difference between interfaces and abstract classes etc
Aside from questions about what they know remember to focus on questions that can help determine if they are a fit socially...
I can never keep which one is which straight in my head.
I only get to interview for junior positions but I always thought a good question for a senior candidate is "What is the hardest bug you have fixed" or alternatively "What is the hardest technical challenge you have overcome"
I don't see the practical value of this question (yes I know the answer). I don't think I ever needed to do what you ask in practice although I have used hiding to implement covariant return types. Never needed to force call the method on A from a variable of type B.
&gt;one language wonders This isn't a thing. Good coders can learn any language and bad ones will suck in them all. The reason it's a shitty question is that you won't learn anything by watching somebody try to learn a language. That takes time and everyone has their own approach to it. Expecting someone to learn a new language while dealing with the stress of an interview? INSANE. I would literally walk out.
As far as I know the main problem with devs from India is that they never tell you if things are hard or cannot be done. They will always agree to do whatever you ask and then deliver something absurd.
Developer of 20 years here and I second /u/andrewsmd87 on that. Those questions are decent. He should easily get 8/10 from that if he knows C#, even if he's stressed out in interviews. If he hasn't had experience with it, it'll show with these.
Because being in an interview is hard. A good developer does a host of things, analyzing business problems, some architecture, interfacing between stakeholders, aligning the different ideas of a team... But at the end of the day, we sit down in our little space, focus and write that stuff. Writing that stuff while someone is watching is a VERY different skillset though. So while it will filter out a lot of people, it will (imo) filter out a lot of the wrong ones too. And about your guy, yes, that one was in over his head there. Doesn't mean that for his job he was bad. You'r not looking for the best programmer in the world, but for someone that gets the job done you need to have off your plate. If you want to judge whether they can learn new stuff I found that curiosity and that usually go and hand to hand together. And you can find out about that by talking to them. Open ended questions like: "What was the biggest technical challenge that you've faced and how did you overcome it?" will get them talking and give you an idea of their current skill ceiling, but also how they think. I am a very fan of making people comfortable and getting them to talk.
The code was still sufficiently decent Linus let it into the kernel. 
As an extra bit of help - there are websites and apps that let you test out regular expressions. You can enter your expression and paste some code in, then see what matches. Pretty good for practicing.
Whenever I make flags, I usually include whatever "presets" I think would be common usage (things like "R&amp;W" for read/write/delete enum, and the like). If you think "all" is commonplace enough to warrant its own enum, I say go for it. Also, Like /u/Xenoprimate said, you should almost always make a None=0 value (for regular enums too)
This. Code written in India is shit, full stop. If you've got Americans managing the team you are lucky if you break even compared to a US team (including a US team of Indian immigrants). 
Exactly. If you want to see someone think through something at a conceptual level but for some reason do not want them to use the programming language their position requires use pseudo code. /u/will_try_not_to &gt; In my experience, the "one language wonders" tend to also be the ones who struggle with debugging when their debugger of choice isn't available. Why does another language need to catch that? Just give them A C# file, a bat script that uses csc to compile the file to a console and get them to use notepad. That person didn't fail because they are so used to their main language, they failed because they got consumed by an issue and forgot to see the bigger picture.
This is not a direct answer to your question but you seem like a reasonable guy so here goes: be honest with yourself in that you are in no position to judge c# expertise because you do not know it well yourself. Blind people are not ideal for judging art contests. Focus your question from a managers perspective: ask behavioral questions and about projects they worked on.
The bitwise not (~) flips all of the bits in 0 to 1, in essence, setting every flag to true.
Depends on whether or not All would be meaningful. Same for None. If you plan on calling the example usage regularly, I would definitely add it. No API that gets used is invalid; you might want to clean up how you do things, but usage is the name for God on the lips and hearts of all Developers.
I've seen this in mscorlib flag types, so I think it should be perfectly valid.
I tried to add Autofac to my project and after I had figured out how to use it and cleaed up a few of my classes, something else broke and I had to stop working on Autofac. After a week or so, I just never got back to it and there were a few other things I wanted to do that seemed much easier of an undertaking (logging, job scheduling and charting in wpf). I know Autofac is the way to go but I think I'm gonna have to rehaul a lot of stuff before I figure it out. Once I have individual little parts working alright, I'll start again from scratch and implement peoper IoC. I wasn't planning on getting into Testing, but in last few days I got caught up in it and now I'm kinda all over the place with lots of news things happening at the same time.
Can a static method be run at the exact same time? Say I have a web site that calls a controller that runs a static method. If two people happen to call that particular page which calls that specific method at exactly the same time, will they run in turn or at the same time? 
Use a tool like hackerrank - and discuss the answers. Also give him or her an actual but simple project, maybe based on a simple sysadmin task and ask them to design it with you jointly, and then give them some time to code it and deliver to you - they can then make the code open source if they want. Don't waste your time too much on questions - ie the language and dialect barrier combined with accents will make it a difficult proposition for both of you.
&gt; Removing the curly braces will come back to haunt you when someone adds a line and forgets to put them back. i think any change by someone who doesn't know how to read code and doesn't know basic syntax rules might end up hurting you
&gt; &gt; What is the difference between the Dispose method and the GC. I've lost track of the 5+ year candidates I interviewed who couldn't tell the difference. No shit, I actually started asking around on forums because I was starting to think that I had some sort of secret knowledge that most developers didn't need to know any more.
https://github.com/isidore/Interview Set a timer for 10 minutes, open a share screen and ask them to get the test to pass (they won't it's to small of a time) At the end of seeing them code you'll know if you don't ever want to see it again, but you won't know if you do want to, so extend the timer for another 40 minutes if they are passing at that point. After 50 minutes you'll know (again it's not about passing the test it's about allowing your brain to process how they work)
I think 10/10 would be expected personally for a individual claiming to be proficient in C#. All ten of those questions are used very often in production code and you really do need to know all 10 of them to be writing enough code in C# to claim some expertise to the language, imo anyways.
Experienced C# developer here. These are all good questions. Other good questions are to ask about when you would use delegates and the proper use of the yield pattern.
It's bizarre. GC internals are fascinating; I don't know why people wouldn't go read up on it.
Yeah, this is certainly a valid design. But as you say, it depends on what it's for.. it also depends on who wrote the code, really :p. Looking at the .NET-framework, it's not done often, but it does happen.
Good reminder to use #defines in general more often too. Thanks for the tip.

Yes. Definitely agree on that. Don't just have someone write a program, work on it with them. Especially if they're coming in with a completely different style of programming knowledge. If you've got a heavily C# or Java dev coming in and you're dev team does Ruby or Python, the dev is gonna have a hard time without any help or explanation. 
Allegedly that’s one of the main reasons they exist. If the privacy issues concern you, you can replace the buttons with images (hosted on your site) that link to the respective services.
This sounds like a pretty good solution. Are there any viable alternatives to Google Analytics?
Most of the things you mention aren't traps or mistakes; they're not wrong, just inefficent. Performance is only an issue if it's identified to be a bottleneck. That said, if you assume a beginner might is going to make these mistakes, then it might be interesting to show an example of how things can go wrong or unexpected.
I'm pretty sure that's just going to throw some sort of cast or binding exception that has nothing to do with `throw`. However, while C# requires throwing a `System.Exception`, the CLR does not. C++ CLI can throw anything, for example. That's why the `AppDomain.UnhandledException` event stores it as an `object`.
Regarding your concerns about testing with DateTime and your Func&lt;DateTime&gt; solution - One of the many benefits that [NodaTime](http://nodatime.org/1.3.x/userguide/testing.html) offers is the IClock interface for testing. Jon Skeet talks about this in his Pluralsight course [C# Design Strategies](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/csharp-design-strategies/table-of-contents#) in the section about Dependency Injection. There's some good stuff out there from Matt Johnson about [issues](http://blog.nodatime.org/2011/08/what-wrong-with-datetime-anyway.html) with the design of DateTime and how NodaTime helps you get your point across about what **type** of DateTime you're talking about. All pretty interesting to take a look at. I tried to do it justice with a small [blog post](http://buildplease.com/pages/dates-from-offsets/) but there is much more depth to be explored.
I like to use message classes to send view data back to the client and any error messages I want to be displayed. I put try catch blocks in my service later, log the full exception to a log file or such and send back an error string in my response message to the client that says "There was an exception processing the request" or something like that. You can get the full stack trace in your logging mechanism and you're not exposing any potentially sensitive data to the client/user.
&gt; 1) It initializes all fields in the current class. &gt; 2) It calls its base class's constructor. &gt; 3) It executes the code you wrote in the constructor. It still annoys me that we can't change that order. There are times when I really want to do some validation before calling the base class constructor.
&gt; Now let's say that you want to make a minor change in your code (changing an optional parameter to another value). I've never actually seen that in real life. Not once. Optional parameters are almost always fall back to the default value for the parameter type (e.g. 0/null). The only exception I've seen is Booleans, which sometimes use `true` as the default. But either way, I've never seen anyone change a default nor have I ever been tempted to myself.
Can I get an example for #9?
Yes, lots of people know how to write this C# program.
Would take less than an hour to write as well.
Hey, quit being rational, this is the internet! Never admit when someone else corrects you or makes a good point. 
The reason you would use the All flag, is so that inside, you can test if a flag is present: void do_something(FileTypeSettings flags) { if ( flags &amp; FileTypeSettings.Text) { // handle text } else if ( flags &amp; FileTypeSettings.Xml) { // handle } ... } In the above case, everything works as expected.
And the solution was...?
3)- yield return is my favorite feature of c#
here is a fix: private int? _hashcode; public override int GetHashCode() { if (!_hashcode.HasValue) _hashcode = X; return _hashcode.Value; } ... class Program { static void Main() { var d = new Dictionary&lt;Foo, string&gt;(); var key = new Foo {X = 1}; var key2 = new Foo {X = 2}; d[key] = "key"; d[key2] = "key2"; Console.WriteLine(d[key]); //key Console.WriteLine(d[key2]); //key2 key.X = 2; Console.WriteLine(d[key]); //key Console.WriteLine(d[key2]); //key2 var key3 = new Foo {X = 1}; d[key3] = "key3"; Console.WriteLine(d[key]); //key Console.WriteLine(d[key2]); //key2 Console.WriteLine(d[key3]); //key3 Console.ReadKey(); } } mutable objects as dictionary keys are still dumb ideas (hashing algorithms become more inefficient), but at least you don't get weird things happening in the dictionary if you prevent the `GetHashCode()` method from mutating.
The Northwest Territories. There are some Sun boxes being used by some companies around here, and some Linux servers for Internet facing services, but I think it's fair to say that 99% of business servers here are running Windows from my observations.
I've got to be honest; I don't really work in a job where I have to worry so much about memory that I need to know the inner workings of garbage collection to automatically, without a doubt, be able to carry on a conversation about the differences (off-hand I know you call Dispose() explicitly whereas the GC handles itself). I agree that it's interesting but, well, lots of things about my job are interesting and I find that if I am not actively working with something there's a good chance I'm not going to remember it during a pressure situation like an interview. To the OP, I think the big thing is to try and ask questions that are *not* just answerable via Google. "How" and "why" questions are great; I disagree that "what's the difference between a struct and a class" will be terribly useful unless you rephrase it as "describe to me a situation in which you would use a struct instead of a class". I guess the big thing to watch out for is that interviews, done properly, are two-way processes. It is important for you to know that the other guy is competent but at the same time there are some real issues with asking certain questions in certain ways.
So here is my base issue: you are looking to hire a person who knows more about C# than you do. That's fine, but I think there are a couple of things to watch out for. - Be wary of "gotcha" questions and questions that have more than one answer. A lot of people have expressed something like "how would you do X", which is great, but if a guy tells you how he might do it that doesn't correspond to the answer you've looked up or even performed yourself, that may not actually mean that he's *wrong*, just that he figured out a different way. - Avoid trivia and ask about process. If the guy doesn't really know what he's doing, I'm confident that this will come out as a part of this talk. And hell, even if the person knows about the process of coding but your interview somehow didn't uncover the fact that he's relatively new with C#, it's relatively easy to pick up the language if you already think like a programmer. - Remember that they are interviewing you as much as you are interviewing them. You seem like a reasonable person so this is probably nothing you don't already know. But, you know, since you may well be speaking with a SME, prepare to be humble and all that. Probably added this too late, but good luck!
&gt; off-hand I know you call Dispose() explicitly whereas the GC handles itself Congratulations, you're hired. I wasn't asking for a dissertation on memory management in an interview, I just wanted to see that the candidate knew they were different concepts. And most failed.

I've read the Nodatime documentation and also watched Jon's Design strategies video you mentioned. The only reason I didn't jump on it was because im using DateTime in my sql server, and I just couldn't make up my mind if adding NodaTime types in the class AND also having DAteTime would make it more confusing. 
&gt; "premature optimization is the root of all evil" Is a well known and agreed upon saying in programming. Solve the solution in whatever way you want, and then get some real world stats against your solution and see if it needs improving. As the arrays are the same size. I would just loop over both arrays and do everything in one loop. for (int x = 0; x &lt; source.Length; x++) { if (source[x] == null) continue; destination[x] = source[x]; }
Tried that but because of my use case (see above comment) it needs to be more efficient. Thanks for replying.
Well does it actually throw an error with the above code?
You could use a LINQ statement to reduce the arrays, but I am not sure what counts as an execution inside of Space Engineers. And LINQ would only technically hide the loop. It sounds like you need to stop managing two arrays and wherever you create the data for the arrays switch them out of a single collection. If order doesn't matter and you only want unique values then I would suggest a HashSet.
sql on azure already runs very abstracted, and MS doesn't have to pay windows license fees anyway.
Yea, always exactly same size. Honestly don't understand this, but i'm a little slow for these things. Thanks for the suggestion, I'll tinker with this for a while.
I'd go for this. I've seen this before in places, and as long as it's contextually relevant to the API and how it's intended to be used I don't see any issue with it whatsoever. [Flags] public enum FileTypeSettings { Text = 1, Xml = 2, Rtf = 4, Png = 8, All = 15, }
This also produces a new array (it doesn't modify Array1 or Array2). I'd suggest assigning it to a new variable. var newArray = Array1.Select((x, i) =&gt; x ?? Array2[i]); It's also lazy-evaluated. If you're going to access the variable newArray multiple times, do this: var newArray = Array1.Select((x, i) =&gt; x ?? Array2[i]).ToArray(); Edit: Shorter Code!
15 would break it, you'd want 16.
Yield allows you to implement iterators/enumerables https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9k7k7cf0.aspx You consume an iterator method by using a foreach statement or LINQ query. Each iteration of the foreach loop calls the iterator method. When a yield return statement is reached in the iterator method, expression is returned, and the current location in code is retained. Execution is restarted from that location the next time that the iterator function is called. You can use a yield break statement to end the iteration. Edit: Here's a primer on some of the use cases: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/575713/What-is-the-use-of-csharp-Yield-keyword 
I'm trying to use this, but the in-game compiler is saying: "'System.Array' does not contain a definition for 'Select'". I'm still tinkering with it since the namespace of being inside a game limits access to some things.
Can you add namespaces? *Select* is an extension method in the System.Linq namespace. Edit: If you cannot add namespaces, this should also work. for(var i = 0; i != array1.Length; i++){array1[i] = array1[i] ?? array2[i];} array1 is now modified to have all nulls filled with the values in array2. Edit: Made the code shorter.
adding namespaces? Thats a bit outside my knowledge, but I think I might be able to if I have an extra '}' to close the parent class (I used this in the past for extension classes). as for your latest code sample, I'm getting lost. Which array is the source and destination? And the last array is index '2', is that on purpose?
Oh cool. Valid concerns. I will say that a lot of the NodaTime types have a `.ToDateTime***()` BCL conversion method provided. Especially LocalDateTime (`.ToDateTimeUnspecified()`) and Instant (`.ToDateTimeUtc()`). Bonus with these methods is that it chooses the appropriate `DateTime.Kind`property for your result DateTimes. The main reason why I suggested Noda - if you added that `Func&lt;DateTime&gt;` into each constructor simply for testing purposes and not for production, that's a code smell called "[Test Logic in Production](http://xunitpatterns.com/Test%20Logic%20in%20Production.html)". A common culprit is overriding Equality operators. Using Noda and mocking IClock in your tests would likely remedy that smell.
well it compiles, but the output is missing anything in the source array. I suspect there might be a problem elsewhere when filling the source array prior to the merge. Thanks for you help, this saves me a bunch of hassle.
Ok, think this part now works but my script overall still needs a lot of work. :/ I think I found a couple errors in the sample to gave, here's what I made: for(var i = 0; i != destArray.Length; i++) {destArray[i] = srcArray[i] ?? destArray.screen[i]; } I *think* the middle var in the if (what do you call a 1-line if statement?) was backwards. Thanks a lot for your help.
It has overhead, though. Don't use yield return for small, in-memory collections. If you know it's going to be 1 - 1000 items in a List&lt;T&gt;, just return the damn list. Do use yield return if 1) producing a single result is expensive/slow for each and every result 2) the consumer of the enumerable may not want to consume the entire enumerable Reading records off of a large file on disk is the canonical example of what yield return is for. HOWEVER, there's another big caveat. If both reading the record and processing the record are slow, then yield return will be horrendously slow because it is just sitting there while you process. e.g. read record (yield return), process record (HTTP call), read next record. Instead, using a producer/consumer pattern, you could be reading off the disk and processing at the same time.
Well, somewhat excusable, since that was in there before generics existed.
The generated SQL query don't have ' around the textBox4 content. But don't do that, as /u/ChanceDriven say, always use [parameterized](http://www.csharp-station.com/Tutorial/AdoDotNet/Lesson06) [query](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yy6y35y8.aspx). Even if you don't care about security from SQL injection, with parameters you won't have to escape ' in the queries, and you won't be burn by server &amp; client different regional settings (mostly when handling dates)
That's a good link. I agree with what you say, and I do want to use NodaTime. It's just something I'll get around to down the road. Once I smooth out some big issues, I'll give Autofac another try and that should solve a lot of my problems. 
You could have an optional command line argument that would override the detection of the current time.
All is perfectly fine, but DO NOT hard code the value; Here's an example of a Flagged Enum with cumulative values: [Flags] public enum MonthlyInterval { [Description("Not Used")] NotUsed = 0, [Description("Sunday")] Sunday = 1, [Description("Monday")] Monday = 2, [Description("Tuesday")] Tuesday = 4, [Description("Wednesday")] Wednesday = 8, [Description("Thursday")] Thursday = 16, [Description("Friday")] Friday = 32, [Description("Saturday")] Saturday = 64, [Description("Day")] Day = Sunday | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday, [Description("Week Day")] WeekDay = Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday, [Description("Weekend Day")] WeekendDay = Sunday | Saturday, } 
 using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection("Data Source=DESKTOP-FUMLGK7; Initial Catalog=Wupti; Integrated Security=True")) { SqlCommand søg = new SqlCommand("select efternavn from Ordrer where ordrenr = @ordrenr;", connection); søg.Parameters.AddWithValue("ordrenr", textBox4.Text); connection.Open(); using (SqlDataReader reader = søg.ExecuteReader()) { textBox5.Text = (reader.Read()) ? reader[0].ToString() : "No data"; } }
He has that part correct. The query is an argument of the command, not of ExecuteReader. 
Honestly it feels like you're forcing a pattern into a situation that it's not particularly suited for. It definitely looks but it doesn't really make sense. Typically, you would see method chaining like this when each step is optionally decorating behavior of the source object. Think about something list a collect of Accounts: var accounts = customer.GetAccounts(); return accounts .FilterByType(Account.PayPal) .Sort() .DeDupe(); At each point in that method chain you were dealing with a list of Accounts. Look back at what your ideal end goal is. Are you dealing with the same kind of object along the way? It's easy to imagine that sometimes you would want an unfiltered or unsorted list of Accounts. Can you say the same thing about what you're doing? 
Pretty much all of the non-generic collections should be treated as deprecated. In fact, early plans for Silverlight including not offering them at all.
It makes no sense to talk about `Hashtable`. If you see it in code, it's most likely legacy code.
I disagree. 3: UNIX seconds.
Thanks Bruce
In practice, though, since a long time now, throwing an object that doesn't derive from `System.Exception` will result in the object being wrapped in `RuntimeWrappedException`.
Oh, really? public class Fubar { public Fabur Fabur { get; set; } } public struct Fabur { } new Fubar(); The struct `Fabur` is created on the heap. It's not boxed.
Also there is thread safe version of dictionary [ConcurrentDictionary](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd287191\(v=vs.110\).aspx)
I dunno why it's not more spread. I mean, after your first week of pulling your hairs out because of date issues, you'd think one would start searching for a standard, and finding UTC to the very least. But no, whenever I have to parse dates retrieved from another program/webservice/etc from my company, it's never in UTC format. NE-VER.
That works! Would you mind explaining textBox5.Text = (reader.Read()) ? reader[0].ToString() : "No data"; in detail? I don't understand half of the syntax you're using, never seen a ? used before (I'm quite new to programming)
Removed: Rule 7. Consider adding more substance, perhaps with code samples demonstrating the differences, or why some of the differences are important. For example: &gt; Structures and classes don't adopt the same approach for the System.Object.Equals() method. Ok, so what are the differences in their approaches? &gt; Classes are usually used for large amounts of data, whereas Structure are usually used for smaller amounts of data. Why?

Well, I don't *have* to use one of these patterns, or any pattern. I'm just trying to find a common interface for all of these steps that will satisfy my needs and these patterns seem to come close, but like you say, they probably don't make sense. However, method chaining doesn't have to be of the same type, which is why I think there's a solution here somewhere, I just can't figure it out. For example, in C#, I can do: var accounts = customer.GetAccounts(); // List of Account objects return accounts .Where(account =&gt; account.IsActive()) // Select only active users .Select(account =&gt; account.name) // Grab only the name field .Aggregate((current, next) =&gt; current + ", " + next); // Join all names into a single string // returns "Jim,Pam,Scott"
Registry you say? well so much for linux :c, can you add an option to store the list in a file? Other than that, yap seems good :)
Thanks
Thanks
Visual Studio is still the way I'd go, I know the Community (free) edition is pretty limited, and I haven't used it, but I'd still take a look to see if it fits your needs. If not, [Project Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) is an option. I haven't tried that either, but it's new and seems to be getting some good reviews. EDIT: sounds like the VS2015 community edition isn't that limited, good to know.
The Community edition mainly limits the team features. For solo development, you can't tell the difference from the regular version.
The Community edition mainly limits the team features. For solo development, you can't tell the difference from the regular version.
The community edition is hardly limited. The express version is very limited.
I tried using Project rider as Visual Studio won't install on my computer, How do I run the code, isn't as simple as when I did Java on NetBeans
This would have been useful information for you to include in your post/question. I would strongly recommend trying to get Visual Studio going as it is the undisputed best .NET IDE. Project Rider is still in early development. You might be better off with a more mature, easy to use IDE then. If you still can't get Visual Studio Community going, perhaps consider trying MonoDevelop? It's pretty easy to get setup and build/running your code.
Precisely. Or if you use SVN, a lot of nice add-ons for that too. 
Debugging works ok, and remote debugging is indispensable for embedded devices.
A little old, but "Writing Solid Code" by Steve Maguire is decent. Also bear in mind that many in-house coding practices can be a little arbitrary. Often there is no right-or-wrong, but you should follow them because being consistent with those around you makes it easier to read each-others code.
Always get paid for your work. There are intern positions if you're in college or just out of it... but go in to any position expecting to do work worthy of pay. It sounds like you're ready for a Junior/Assistant/whatever-the-term-is level programming. Depending on where you are there are companies that will hire you and so long as you're willing to learn (possibly getting certs, ask about their training program, most companies love that question because it suggests you're in for the long haul and want to get better). Check out who is hiring, what technologies they want people to know. Learn how GIT/TFS work. Learn how real companies deal with the actual business of programming (Agile, etc).
Clean Code is good
My go-to library for someone interested in reading about practices, in roughly the order I think you should read them: * Code Complete * Clean Code * Head-First Design Patterns (it uses Java, whatever, you can learn from it.) * The Art of Unit Testing * .NET Framework Design Guidelines (Available on MSDN for free, Reddit screws up the link formatting: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229042(v=vs.110).aspx) * Agile Patterns, Principles, and Practices in C#
I don't have a cs degree, and I work as a software developer at a fortune 100 tech consulting firm. You are probably correct about the googles and the microsofts of the world, but beyond the major players, you can get in on the ground floor many places as long as you can prove aptitude in other ways. And my current employer wasn't just an outlier either. I've also gotten final interviews/offers from 3 other companies in my time working here. For two of those, I was lucky enough to have a personal connection, but at that point you could just make the argument that it's more about who you know rather than what you have on your resume. I don't think anyone should be discouraged without a degree. Fill up a competent portfolio and build a competitive resume via other means, and prepare for interviews and do everything you can to "wow" people to make up for any perceived disadvantage.
In your neck of the wood and with the right connection that may be true, but for any company with an HR department, if you don't have the piece of paper (diploma) you won't even get a call back. When I first got my present job 18 years ago you needed a college degree to get hired. Today for the same exact job you need a Bsc with experience or better. Like I said, programmers are a dime a dozen and company can be picky.
That is absolutely untrue. My company has 300k+ employees, and our HR department not only processed me, but they actually referred me to an even more technical role than I had originally applied to. My "neck of the woods" is the fastest growing city for tech in the United States, so it certainly has nothing to do with my location or size of company. This is not only my experience, as dozens of my peers also obtained development positions without cs degrees. I also wonder why you are spreading discouraging misinformation when you are an 18 year vet? You haven't had any firsthand experience with the current recruiting landscape, so why speculate with malignant remarks in a forum that functions explicitly as a jumpstart into the industry for beginners?
&gt;Head-First Design Patterns I like this book because it effectively explains the why behind the patterns, it almost gets you to the point where you feel like you came up with the pattern. That being said, if the vein of questions he's looking for is around variable declaration and pre/post increment evaluation, probably not a good option just yet.
That is your personal anecdotal experience only, sorry. Oh and stop with the melodrama act please. This is a free forum and everyone is free to answer as he sees fit. If you want to play SJW do it one someone else time. We don't hire self taught peoples when we can get highly educated and professional ones for the same price in todays market. College and university are graduating hundreds if not thousands each year and those have at least showed dedication to their future by taking the time and investing thousands of dollars in their education instead of reading a book or two and hanging out on stackoverflow. Sorry buddy but that's the way it is.
It's funny you say that my view is anecdotal when I explicitly have mentioned that I know many peers who are all cs degree-less and employed in the field. You are truly the one who has anecdotal evidence supporting your argument. It seems clear to me that you are unhappy with whatever situation you're in so you go on beginner forums and disparage other people to gain some sort of sad satisfaction, or perhaps to feel superior. I assume some of these "highly educated and professional" college kids are making you feel unqualified? Perhaps you should return to school to get in the know on the modern side of tech since apparently all these crappy Internet resources are worthless (Lol). Also why are you apologizing to me for "the way it is"? I have a great job and have been successful at leveraging more offers... And I'm certainly not going to apologize for providing a foil to your dim (in more ways than one...) outlook on entering the tech workforce. People deserve to have a realistic outlook on it, not your pessimistic gloom and doom. Yes, you have to work hard and do a little more with your personal work to separate yourself from degree holders, but it's very doable.
Removed: Rule 3. Rule 4. Probably more related subreddits (perhaps /r/windowsdev) for this. Quick googling yielded [this page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/publish/app-submissions) which seems to indicate that you can make an "Update" submission with new screenshots as part of the "descriptions page".
Oh boy... Get over yourself buddy. I wouldn't even hire you to empty the trash in my office. In fact you are probably unemployed or working as a code monkey for some temp agency. Again, no one hires a hack when they can hire someone who took the time to invest in an education if both are the same price, which they are presently in this economy.
Aww geeze sorry thanks!
You never call GetMonthsName to populate your array with the names of the months.
Add-ins and macros aren't the same thing. * Macros are written inside Word, Excel, etc. using the VBA IDE. * Add-ins can be written in any language that can expose COM objects. 
&gt; .NET Framework Design Guidelines (Available on MSDN for free, The MSDN version is incomplete. It gives you the guidelines, but the book version tells you why those guidelines exist.
&gt; Ages 6 and up That's a pretty interesting rating for a tobacco related product ;) Congrats on shipping something!
There is a library called [Tmds.MDns](https://github.com/tmds/Tmds.MDns) which implements Zeroconf without depending on a separate Bonjour or Avahi service. I have used it to search the LAN for Chromecast devices.
It's [juice](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_0yav6k072Dg/TTq_xM8nXOI/AAAAAAAAAEU/amB8QcKmwMU/s1600/2OyDh.jpg) though.
The must read book is **.NET Framework Design Guidelines**. This is far better than any of the other books listed for the simple reason that all of the theories have been tested. The .NET framework is based on them and you can actually see where it worked and didn't work
Do not use global variables. The method `GetMonthsName` does not need a global variable. It instead could have a locally scoped variable that it returns to you:- public string[] GetMonthsName() { string[] months = new string[12]; months[0] = "Janurary"; months[1] = "February"; months[2] = "March"; months[3] = "April"; months[4] = "May"; months[5] = "June"; months[6] = "July"; months[7] = "Auguest"; months[8] = "September"; months[9] = "October"; months[10] = "November"; months[11] = "December"; return months; } The same goes for `ReadInput`, `rainFall` should not be a global variable:- public static void ReadInput() { string[] months = GetMonthsName(); int[] rainFall = new int[12]; for (int i = 0; i &lt; months.Length; i++) { Console.Write("Please enter the rainfall amount for " + months[i] + ": "); rainFall[i] = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine()); } }
Visual Studio. It's free and awesome.
I have no idea at all, nothing comes up at all, its Ok now though I found Xamarin,
&gt; So it's just a shorter way to make an if-else statement? Yes. &gt; One more question actually. What does reader[0].ToString() do? It's all covered here. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqldatareader%28v=vs.110%29.aspx `reader[i].ToString()`, i represents the item (columns) indexer. It represents the ordinal column position in the result set from `0 to reader.FieldCount -1`. You can also write this as `reader.Item(i).ToString()` or if you know the column name as `reader["ColumnName"].ToString()`. If you know the column name, use that since it's less likely to change. If you have multiple rows returned you'll need to loop across the results to access each of them one row at a time. while (reader.Read()) { // Do something }
&gt; but for any company with an HR department, if you don't have the piece of paper (diploma) you won't even get a call back. Have a job with a fortune 500 company as a programmer, never set foot in college nor do I have relevant certifications or any connections. Got a job this year as an engineer for another fortune 500, turned it down, still no degree, no certs, no connections. I don't know where you are looking; Maybe Google or Microsoft? I can assure you these companies I mentioned have a sizeable HR dept. &gt;When I first got my present job 18 years ago you needed a college degree to get hired. That was 18 years ago. Times have changed. &gt; Like I said, programmers are a dime a dozen and company can be picky. Yup, programmers that do not specialize are absolutely a dime a dozen. 
The pane on the left is the solution explorer. A solution has one or more projects. Those projects can be of many different types, including C# language. Each project gets built into a deliverable, so for a C# project that'd be a .exe (executable) or .dll (shared library). 
Thanks
Maybe get Visual studio? its free and might help a beginner understand things easier with intelisense and error reporting https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs But to answer your questions in the screenshot.... on the left, that's the solution explorer, its showing your solution, what projects are in it, and what classes you have in that project. Top, layout editing tools? hover over them should tell you what they do. just looks like it helps with text formatting? code: Thats the main function of that class... you already understand it in the other screenshot, the syntax is just different. What exactly are you trying to do? I always find it easier to have some sort of plan when learning new code rather than just jumping in. 
&gt;Personally I don't add curly braces for one liners. I don't either, but I usually put it on one line then. if(shape==null) throw new ArgumentNullException("shape");
I cannot believe this never crossed my mind. For multiple parameters you could do something like this (if order was important): public MyClass(int value1, int value2) : base(ValidateValue(value1, value2), value2) 
Right on. Grats on your app!
&gt; I suspect but am to lazy to google that the cryptoprovider isn't being handled correctly either. Correct. It implements `IDisposable` and should be in a using statement. 
This may not completely be the approach you were looking for, but there are some tools that would allow you to generate docs from templates without interfacing with Word directly at all -- especially if you were aiming for something like your last bullet point. Check out [Templater](http://templater.info/). It lets you create a template document, then in a few lines of code, replace all the tags programatically.
Thanks a lot for your explanation. So if I don't know the exact number of columns in my result, I can just you a while (someint &gt; reader.FieldCount -1) ? I'm asking because there has to be a way to do that, since you can't always know the amount of columns in the database beforehand.
Out of curiosity, what interaction are you wanting to make with word? I have written a small class library using COM Interop but it currently only interacts with excel and outlook (currently only to send emails but I've been meaning to look into it further to read and sort emails also). But yeah anyway, I haven't looked into word much but know their is a COM Interop DLL for it, so it would be good to know what you're looking for.
Use awesomium?
The problem actually states to use 2 different arrays. Last time I tried to do a shortcut I got no credit at all for the homework assignment...kind of childish if you ask me. So now I follow the directions lol
There's a .net library called DocX (https://docx.codeplex.com/) that you can download and may help you build .docx files from whatever application you write. I haven't used it too much but it might be worth a look.
He said Javascript so he's more than likely referring to [Office 365 addins](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj220060.aspx) which are written in JS ("web technologies")
Surprise, MS is buying them out!
Thank you sir!
I'd like to try to avoid using commercial add ons. 
Alternative to com: docx.codeplex.com
Honestly, if you're comfortable with web stuff, I'd say start with a WebAPI project. Mva (Microsoft virtual academy) and pluralsight are both good resources with tutorials you can follow along with. By doing a web api, you might be able to write a backend server that a website can interface with.
Nice! I hadn't heard of that. Neat comparison [here](http://cathalscorner.blogspot.com/2010/06/cathal-why-did-you-create-docx.html) with COM/OOXML/DocX, showing code required to do the same task.
Polling is out, hence the desire to be able to push a response back to the client at some arbitrary time after the initial request was made. This needs to be as light on network traffic as possible.
Thanks for adding the clarification!
That is true, I do have to start somewhere. I appreciate the help this channel has given me, you all rock :)
Can you provide your own, additional, javascript file that overwrites the alert function?
Don't believe the job listings. Sure, most of them say prefer CS degree or they require one. They are putting those as requirements or desired qualifications because they do actually want candidates who have a base of knowledge. Also, most indicate equivalent experience is acceptable as well. Having said that, job experience and proven ability ALWAYS trumps education in this field. We are technical people here right? Or is this the wrong forum, because I thought that was a no-brainer (can't tell from the thread below). So like some of the other posts have indicated, there are ways for you to start building experience. Relevant and related experience applies so perhaps look for a junior development position or you can also get into the system administration side where in some cases there is overlap. Get in the right department (it, software engineering, devops, or whatever) and start applying and developing your programming skills and knowledge. The more you apply yourself, the more opportunities will open up. Sometimes small companies are a good place to go at first because they need more jack-of-all-trades types (even if that means help desk at first). However, you may get better mentors in a larger environment. DISCLAIMER: Everyone on the internet is an expert! /s
Use events then which most mq systems support
I strongly recommend OOXML, possibly using a better third party library. COM interop can be a nightmare, and is sensitive to the version of Office used, etc.
Another thing that can go wrong is that it only works with ASCII! So basically it only works with english text, and that's assuming no fancy double quotes and similar. It's generally a very bad idea to use the ASCII encoding. It should be UTF8.
I wouldn't recommend using #defines more in general. It makes the code harder to reason about.
Read up on int.Parse and TryParse. That's what you want.
Okay, so there seems to be opinions suggesting either OOXML or COM via WPF are equally valid with different people having both positive and negative experiences with each. The app as it is now is basically VB code inside Word that enables a user to populate a word document with different sections, and update a customer name throughout the document. So I'm looking to build an app that presents a UI where the user can choose different sections via checkboxes and the document will be populated accordingly, and then the user will work on their created document, adding extra content etc. Word will be installed on the users computer, though we have already run into issues with different versions of Word, so that is a consideration. Also it appears to me that the method of using building blocks has caused headaches for the people working on the current version. &gt; That's only if you have some crazy Word-inside-my-WPF-application thing going on though. So, is what I describe above a crazy Word inside WPF situation? Is WPF for creating an application rather than automating Word document creation? Is an application the way to interact with Word, or would it be a case of building code into a Word template (using the OOXML SDK)? I don't necessarily want to hide Word from the user, more provide a good UI, and a maintainable code base that can be developed and iterated over in a sane way. It does seem as if I want to use COM/DocX, and I realise a lot of these questions will be answered as I understand C#/.net/WPF better. Currently the UI of our VB app is horrible, and selfishly I want to use this as an exercise to learn C#, so I don't know if one way is more C# focused than another, or more *nice app experience* than another? The Add-in option was more as I considered a [JS/HTML based solution](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/runtimes/office) might be easier to get started with. This is all really helpful btw, thankyou!
Yeah, WPF keeps appearing to be the most robust and standard solution. Thanks.
I'm only into week 4 of my course, and I don't understand how or where i need to put that into the script.
It won't be server side, I'm not looking to serve anything up to the user, rather provide them with a document template with various options and a UI to create a Word doc they can then work on. That's good to know though, thanks.
It was [this](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/runtimes/office) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaLVfaj1mW8) I was referring to. I wasn't sure if it was just a 365 option or supported in Desktop Word 2010 onwards.
No problem.
This is probably a good resource for you. It's a great way to learn the basics. https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-8295?l=bifAqFYy_204984382
I mean... I'm sure you've thought of this. And dismissed it for valid reasons... But what about Mail Merge? https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Use-mail-merge-to-create-and-print-letters-and-other-documents-f488ed5b-b849-4c11-9cff-932c49474705 Something here about showing &amp; hiding section depending on data: http://superuser.com/questions/670448/word-mail-merge-show-or-hide-table having the sections as separate documents would improve maintainability, but might make deployment more difficult.
In addition to VBA you also have the ribbon to work with by coding it in xml attached to a .dotm template. This provides things like gallery pickers and buttons to interact with the document.
How does that solve any of OP's problem?
 StringToInt("-1") == StringToInt("abc")
It's a suggestion of a good place to start on c# development
I don't think he asked for that
As the others have said it take a string and converts it to a message digest (MD5). This has known collisions however and is too small to be used in any secure context. It was originally developed to provide a unique key for usenet newsgroups. This algorithm has largely been replaced with SHA256 now. Look here for more info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2 
Concur.
I have written and am currently writing a lot of this type of code. I've found myself moving towards more expressive and longer names for things. Later when you're tracing through something you're going to be trying to keep track of whether you're working against the model or the tables (or the whatever you're modeling you're actual data store as) and you'll be happy when the code is helping you keep it all straight. Ubiquitous widescreen monitors and intellisense counter the two main arguments against the verbose approach.
You should read up on the big 4 parts of OOP: Polymorphism, Inheritance, Data Abstraction, Encapsulation. Then read about classes, interfaces, abstract classes. Understand why they are used, their purpose, maybe try building a simple programming that uses some classes (like a simple text game or bank account simulator with withdraw/deposit functions). 
Good point.
&gt; I have learned about OOP through PHP Whatever you do, DO NOT open the interview with that. Things to learn about and look into: * Classes - abstract, concrete * 3 pillars of OOP - Polymorphism (overloading), Inheritance, Encapsulation * Static Classes * Design (i.e. singleton) * Constrictors, methods, properties - private, public, internal, protected, etc... * Interfaces and why they are useful 
dis is it
OK so my comment is from a previous post that was discussing a "tips for junior C# devs" and I said the article missed many of these points: * Learn to use interfaces * Learn dependency injection * Learn some design patterns, better abstraction, all that. With some examples such as passing (injecting) a service into a class so that you can easily swap implementations. (controller &lt;-&gt; service &lt;-&gt; repository/data access is a common one) * Better examples of `? :` and `??` operators to make code smaller and more concise (and easier to read) * Some tips on LINQ and how useful things like `Any` and `All` are in some situations to avoid a `foreach` * In fact if this is for junior devs I'd have expected "you can use foreach in almost every situation apart from modifying the original collection (unless creating a new collection)" * Fucking comment your fucking code. Yes, both the triple slash xml comments and also some lines in your methods in case the code is not that easy to understand. No I'm not talking put shit like `// This assigns y to x` but at the other end don't subscribe to the "methods should be so clear you never need comments" bullshit. While it's nice, a method is rarely *that* small, plus if someone else is reading it they still might need some comments, especially if not everyone has the same domain knowledge for a particular business process for example. * Use Stylecop and listen to it and follow the C#/.NET/Stylecop rules and conventions. This makes everyone's code conform to the same style therefore easier to mentally parse. No one wants your `mYMEthod111` naming convention. * Use `Environment.NewLine`, I don't want to see `\r\n` anywhere. Nice way to break your code on everything apart from Windows. * Stop putting `Console.WriteLine` everywhere to get output. Nice way to break unit testing. Also goes against encapsulation, and the "a class/method should do one defined thing well". Instead return a string and *then* output it. * Stop storing URI's as `string`. You literally have `System.Uri` with a load of good helper methods. * Unit test Unit test Unit test Unit test Unit test (Ballmer anyone?) * Don't use `try` for none-exceptional situations, like when parsing a number. Use `TryParse`. * Learn the collections in the BCL. * **USE Path.Combine NOT string.Concat/Join**
 ^ this was going to be my reply as well and where I started. IT's a great start.
Yes, that is ok because each thread is working on a different object. You get into trouble when both threads are making changes to the same object (or the same static field) at the same time.
I have found that most of my problems is that I forget to call something or forget the ';' at the end of a line lol. 
No, I did not. virtual keyword and overriding should be on this list, though.
I'm a professional developer. I've also done a lot of mentoring and tutoring so I've got some practice explaining complicated things.
You've given us very little information and asked us a whole bunch of questions. As you can imagine, it is difficult to help you with so little context or information.
Phew, so much! Thanks for all the suggestions so far! Now I know what to start reading into and working on tonight. 
Try it whichever way you want to get it to work. Experiment. Once you get it working and producing the correct output, reflect on your code/design and try a different approach if you don't like it. Sometimes it's easier to figure out a better way once you've written and can review your initial implementations.
You wouldn't have to do polling. Use eventing or to take it a few steps further, wrap the implementation up in a custom TPL dataflow block, then all you have to do is link to an action and the method will get called whenever messages come in, and you can manage that link easily.
*Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition* is the top choice, *SharpDevelop* is another good choice, but it lacks some of the features of VS2015
Focus on the first 3 of this guy's comment + unit testing. Good design principles are valuable, but I would not expect someone going for a summer internship to know anything as specific as Environment.NewLine. If the interview just becomes a checklist of "do you know what this thing is called", they really don't know how to hire(which is fairly common).
Learn about the [SOLID principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_\(object-oriented_design\)). Don't just re-iterate it though. Know what each of them represents/accomplishes and how it affects real code.
Idk, they just started this internship thing not long ago. But they're a reputable company with a big database project (over 7 billion lines of code)
I think you meant to write `cmd.Parameters...` and not `connection.Parameters...`
Thank you sooo much. Thanks. I've been at this for about 4 hours, I thought I tried that, but no, that worked. Thanks
Whether or not it ends up being useful for any (or many) developers, I find this really interesting. Especially as an alternative to interop solutions like SWIG. I haven't dived deeply into your Pseudo project yet, but I'm wondering, how extensible/flexible is Pseudo? Can the developer write their own template or spec for the Pseudo intermediary transpilation, or are the cross-language mappings hard-and-fixed?
You could give the guy an updoot for taking the time to answer your question, saving you time, and answering it correctly.
&gt; I stepped right into that one. (lol) Remember to wipe off your shoes before you come in the house.
Well basically Pseudo consumes pseudo AST. After that it processes it through a pipeline: * `standard_method_call` nodes are translated using the target language "api translator" * standard and optional middlewares that can analyze and tweak the pre-generation AST * code generator that emits the final code pseudo-python is a compiler that translates Python code to Pseudo. So basically right now you can either generate Pseudo AST yourself, or extend the generator using your own middleware ( I am not sure what exactly do yo have in mind)
They have, like, ALL the lines of code.
SOLID? This is snek.
This is an updoot. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmqOV4JkRcs Welcome to reddit.
Excellent. Thank you. One of my previous jobs they used instantiated mapping classes for entity framework to view models. For the life of me, I can't figure out why they do that, because the methods weren't using static variables at all. Just ended up requiring that the controller keep a copy of all those instantiated classes. I hadn't even thought about it until I was working on a project at home, after I left there, and was asking myself why they did that.
Thank you. I get the impression I lost op at the talk of polling, I was only saying that polling is one option but events would be better. Glad you agree that a mq would be best here, means I'm not way off haha!
People hear that static methods are bad and run scared from them without understanding when and why they are bad. 
That list went from pretty good, to extremely specific. Seriously, learn the SOLID principles. Seriously. I am not joking. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design) Edit: Super serious.
You can study up but I'd like to give you this one piece of advice. If you don't know something, simply say so and explain what you would do in such a situation. I.e. if they ask a question where you only recognize half the terms they used, simply state it's not something you've worked with, but would solve it by doing some research, and then asking your mentor (or whatever) if your conclusions are correct and if they have any additional input. Since this is an internship, this should be expected. They'll more than likely be happy with the fact that you are humble enough to admit you don't know something, and can recognize that and ask for help. It's not uncommon in the programming world to have a superiority complex. Where what you do is hard, and not everyone can do it, so you always tend to think you're right or you know more than everyone else. That kind of mindset can be toxic in the real world. We just got rid of a new hire because the person would take forever at menial tasks, but would never ask any of us senior guys for help, when it was made abundantly clear that we were more than happy to help explain anything. 
All the best lines of code.
SAP?
We differ from 8601 in interval encoding by using `::` instead of `/` because the former doesn't cause any issues encoded in urls and the latter might. In our system `8601id::` means an interval starting at that date with no end date, `8601id1::8601id2` can have both specified as static dates or one specified as a duration, no missing parts are permitted (in contrast to spec). `::8601id` similarly means an interval with no specified start date ending on the specified value. We also support an in house designed relative date language consisting of `/^(?i)(?&lt;refpoint&gt;\w+)(?&lt;distance&gt;(?&lt;mag&gt;[+-]?\d+)(?&lt;type&gt;\w+))*$/` where refpoints are "today", "now", "last*" where * is a 3 letter or full day of week in `en-us`, "startmonth" and "startyear" and types are d, w, m, y, day, days, week, weeks, month, months, year or years or a 3 letter or full day in `en-us`. So you can say `startyear+1m+3sunday::P3W` to define a 3 week unresolved interval beginning the 3rd Sunday of February this year (for whatever year it is resolved in). If an adequate standard ever develops for doing this (or already does that I happen to be unaware of), we might switch. The whole thing is 200ish lines of javascript to expose one global function and about the same in C#...
I am using VS2015. I'm very familiar with VS2010 from work. Hands down, best IDE I've ever used: VS2015.
Agreed. Although I kinda hope project rider shakes that up a bit. I have a soft spot jet brains' IDEs.
Tips are for programming beginners, not junior devs. Number 3 is often strictly forbidden.
This language does seem to ensnare you. It was supposed to be something I used at work... Now I pretty much exclusively go to C# for general purpose programming. My C++ skills have withered :-/ 
&gt; Cool so far. Fun little language! I realize you probably didn't intend for that to be demeaning, but it wounded me anyway.
I didn't! I see how it comes across. 
In binary? That's not actually that many. 
I believe after userInput = ReadLine() 
Cost, mainly. The licensing for SQL and MSDN for developers comes at a premium when you're a startup with limited funding. Non-profit pricing is pretty great though. 
I have 1 class a week, and the lecturer gives us a powerpoint with barely any functions on it and tells us to google if we need help because him showing us how to do it is basically the same as giving us the answers.
sql has nothing to do with .net 
you made me laugh. thank you.
You heard about [Project Rider](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2016/01/13/project-rider-a-csharp-ide/)?
How so?
&gt;Also learn when not to use syntactic sugar. For ?: in particular, I prefer pretty simple statements. Doing something like var x = ThingToTest().Count &gt; 27 ? someCollection.Where(x =&gt; x.IsItReallySaneEnough() &amp;&amp; x.IsThisShitValid()).ToList() : someOtherCollection.Select(y =&gt; y.AProperty).ToList() makes my eyes bleed
Semi-related question: Has anyone here had issues with checkout branches in a large solution causing VS2015 to freeze? I see plenty of people have this issue but can't find a cause/fix, it works fine in VS2013. Real shame because I desperately want to use VS2015 at work (dear God that Git integration is the most amazing thing I've seen in my life), but having to kill and launch VS every second time I checkout means I have to stick with 2013 for now.
I genuinely believe that swift is only so popular because it's a genuine alternative to objective c. 
$$$ but that has recently changed IMO. VS community is a game changer. Without it, I doubt any startup is willing to shell out thousands of dollars on VS licenses when you can use other languages/tools for free.
My W520 would go nuts when resuming from sleep: it would cut the power, power up again, cut the power, power up again... ad infinitum, unless I disconnected the battery. I had Lenovo support change the mobo and everything, but the problem still persisted. Also, the wires for the speakers had _melted_ for no apparent reason. The frustrating part about the support experience was having to reinstall the Lenovo vanilla OS ... even while the problem was clearly on a layer _below_ the OS -- it never got to the point of loading Windows when that happened.
Here's some pre-written code that you can use. Still wrapping base windows functionality, but it's already written for you. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/295538/how-to-provide-user-name-and-password-when-connecting-to-a-network-share 
&gt; Also s in start() should be capitalized. The amount of people that use the java naming convention perplexes me.
I use VS 2015 anyway, so that's not a problem. Thanks for the link. I'll look into it.
I only just discovered some of this stuff last week, but it's pretty solid so far. The only down side is that I haven't found a way to configure or modify the rules yet. It's pretty good though. I only found one case where I had to suppress a warning because I disagreed with it, and even then it was an edge case not a bad recommendation. 
Used in the designer only.
In my new job ( started few months ago ) I have been doing C# and using VS + resharper ( recently upgraded to vs2015 ) and after trying many other programming environments this is by far one of the best there is out there. I am far from being an expert in those tools but I can see already why people love them :).
Probably a typo, since other method is capitalized.
It's worth remembering that `base` doesn't mean the immediately inherited class. It means, roughly, "take a look up the inheritance tree and find the first instance of the following method/property". An example: public class A { public virtual void Foo() { /* something */ } } public class B : A { /* other bits and bobs */ } public class C : B { public override void Foo() { base.Foo(); // is calling A.Foo(). } } var a = new A(); a.Foo(); // calls A.Foo() var b = new B(); b.Foo(); // calls A.Foo() var c = new C(); c.Foo(); // calls C.Foo() - which, because of the implementation calling base.Foo(), calls A.Foo() 
I haven't tried git at home. I'll let you know if I see anything?
yes, because i'm not a CISSP and you're probably not a CISSP, so it's better to use something that is already proven instead of trying to implement your own secure login system and potentially getting it wrong.
Didn't M$ buy Resharper? It may become integrated. Some of what I hear that Resharper does Eclipse did for Java. (like renaming a variable will rename all instances that it was used) 
Non-profit worker totally agree, it's sweet. Our MSDN licenses gives me pretty much anything I could want/dream of including a FULL version of MSSQL to run locally. However, if I were to start my own business I'd still use Linux. The cost and size of the opensource community alone make it worth it in the long run. the C# community while sizable doesnt have as many/powerful opensource tools so if i dont like one i cant switch to another easily. Again, Microsoft did open source the C# framework and I want to see whats going to happen in the webspace as the community grows and matures. Its a FANTASTIC language with many bells and whistles that Java (a very similar, but NOT THE SAME) language is adopting. 
Rider looks really promising, especially for us who are used to the IntelliJ programs. Still some features missing from the EAP, though. 
This. Swift is just trying too hard to be different for all the wrong reasons
It's a thing of beauty.
Nope, resharper is still pulblished and owned by JetBrains. You may be thinking of Xamarin
Naw thats a [VS feature](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6kxxabwd.aspx), resharper just improves it. The coolest parts of resharper is its automatic code refactoring and simplification. You can write messy code and it just makes it beautiful, makes it use all the syntactic sugar that c# has, simplifies messy nested for loops and complex boolean logic into the most elegant form, and corrects all your names to follow c# naming conventions. I love it. 
There's a few other issues with the code, I'll leave them for you to try and figure out but you can message me if you need help with it.
you're right that is the one I was thinking about. 
Ignore Blend. The one feature that Blend had and VS didn't was the ability to generate copies from the templates of existing controls, so that when you want to customize a control, you don't have to figure out all the features it has by reverse-engineering. And even that now exists in the VS designer. For everything else, I'd argue you're better off writing the XAML by hand.
Everyone in that other thread is right I think. Genetic Algorithms are conceptually very simple. Your best bet is probably to write your own.
Yeah I understand how they work and I could probably write my own. However I'm a bit time restricted and would rather focus on the aspects of my project that I already understand rather then use my time to write and debug a whole other function. Like, I am such a C# noob I only found out about events last night man. 
I'm sure JetBrains would pick up the phone if Microsoft came calling with a billion dollar check
That's because all your math operations within your "+-*/" switch block do addition: case "+": textBox_Result.Text = (resultValue + Double.Parse(textBox_Result.Text)).ToString(); break; case "-": textBox_Result.Text = (resultValue + Double.Parse(textBox_Result.Text)).ToString(); break; case "*": textBox_Result.Text = (resultValue + Double.Parse(textBox_Result.Text)).ToString(); break; case "/": textBox_Result.Text = (resultValue + Double.Parse(textBox_Result.Text)).ToString(); break; default: break; For example, your "*" operation should read: textBox_Result.Text = (resultValue * Double.Parse(textBox_Result.Text)).ToString(); Watch out for copy/paste errors in the future. Also look into how to go about debugging your program with the Visual Studio debugger.

i have that problem with VS, git and Unity - clicking on the branch will freeze the studio and i have to kill it
Although I really like Bob's teaching, really Pluralsite. Com is the place to go for serious training. 
If code you write is incomprehensible to another developer, no matter the skill level, then you have failed as an author of code. It is a huge part of the job to think about maintenance, not only for yourself but also for others. For the most part, the unit tests that have been written should be able to show another developer the way the code works. The combination of these tests and well thought out code beats comments. This is without bringing up the fact that the code may be changed in the future and the comment may get left in it's original state, two parts to maintain for one piece of code.
I was hoping that Eureqa had an open API, but it looks like it is licensed. The program is very cool to play with though !! [Eureqa Genetic Algorithm Program](http://creativemachines.cornell.edu/Eureqa) [Eureqa API](http://www.nutonian.com/products/eureqa-api/) 
Yes I have.
I'd recommend this over plural site if you a newbie, I used it my self when first starting out and it really did help. Maybe just get a years subscription to start.

Right. We generated API controllers for all our code-first models, then implemented OData on top of that. So the example you gave becomes this: GET /People/32?filter=Likes eq 21
Simply because they are bad at running a business. They make very short sighted decisions to "save money" that hemmorages tons of money later. C# ASP.NET is by far the most cost effective toolset. Look at Stackoverflow that rons an absolutely collosal web presence and runs it all on a couple dozen servers.
I thought it was 10, did they reduce it?
Sorry, it may be my mistake, we have less than 5 so...
There's no neat way to do this in c#, you'll have to make an overload for every numerical type ([kinda like what Microsoft themselves did](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.linq.enumerable.sum\(v=vs.100\).aspx)). That is, of course, unless you shy away from **generics** and **dynamics**, I doubt that's what's being expected of you, though.
Yeah I've completed his first 25 videos and found them very useful. Just wondering whether to pay to continue or not :/
The Random object is not a random number, its a (pseudo) random number generator. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.random%28v=vs.110%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396 Try something like this instead to set your random values instead: var rng = new Random(); var rnd01 = rng.Next(); var rnd02 = rng.Next(); .... etc, etc.
Thanks for helping, and I know this method is not ideal to generate random numbers. But I'm mostly wondering why the Writeline and Readline commands won't display anything.
Are you entering anything at the prompt? Your code has a pause after the "Displaying data set of randomly defined integers" line where you are calling readline after the first initial stages of lines. The execution will pause while it waits for input from the user.
Could you paste the class this code lives in will likely help troubleshoot the issue.

Some in the sidebar. Lots of good books and websites out there.
&gt;reading out a line. Do you mean reading *in* a line? I believe he was talking about the first occurrence of Console.ReadLine(); Which will wait until you press enter.
If it's something specific you need to learn/remember I love to use DotNetPerls.com. It's great for those "How do you use Lists again?" or "I've never used Timers before, how do I use them?" moments.
I tried Track_Temp.Dispose(); But it didn't seem to work. However I did notice if I changed the foreach in to a for and set the first file index to read in as 1501 it crashes so I don't think its like a memory problem. Thanks for the help though. 
I've taken a few courses from Bob on [Microsoft Virtual Academy](https://mva.microsoft.com/) and when I start digging into C# more I am probably going to sign up for his site. I really liked his courses and how he taught them.
I am calling spam on this. Newbie posts link, and then three people pop up saying they recommend this site?
You could use use Regex to match the pattern in object A and then String.Contains to find all the matching object B. Quick and dirty example: using System; using System.Text.RegularExpressions; using System.Collections.Generic; public class Program { public static void Main() { string input = "Requirement 11.3.3 Evidences"; var inputList = new List&lt;string&gt;() { "Requirement 11.3.3_1 Evidences", "Requirement 11.3.3_2 Evidences", "Requirement 11.3.4 Evidences" }; var match = Regex.Match(input, @"\d+.\d.\d+"); Console.WriteLine("Matching value: " + match.Value); foreach(string s in inputList) { if (s.Contains(match.Value)) Console.WriteLine(s); } } } Output: Matching value: 11.3.3 Matching items: Requirement 11.3.3_1 Evidences Requirement 11.3.3_2 Evidences 
lol dude open source stuff is literally FREE. beat free
That looks really great! Thanks - my only concern with that is that the input strings don't always have exactly 3 dots, sometimes it's one or two (i.e. "blahblah 6.2 blah" or "req 6.5.4x evidence")
It seems to me that some people will downvote only to get their own answer higher. Not saying this time is because of them but it does make me think of it.
You can look up more options for regex pattern matching. In this case you could change the pattern to @"\d+.\d?.\d" and it will match X.X or X.X.X in a string. Regex can get pretty crazy. Here's a site you can use to test patterns: http://regexstorm.net/tester
Thanks! I really appreciate it - honestly, I am find programming quite difficult, and despite using it, don't even really understand what a regular expression is :( But again, thank you so much!
Alright well lets start out with one first so I can get the hang of overloading. Here's one for float that I think I've figured out: http://i.imgur.com/VgMVgt0.png But it's showing two outputs for the one equation in the console? http://i.imgur.com/VlabPrA.png
HTML is not necessarily valid xml. There are httprequest and httpresponse classes in .Net that you can use to deal with web requests and their response. It's also possible xkcd.com has an RSS feed or some other interface that would let you get comics easier than trying to strip an image out of the response.
not overkill IMO. pretty simple and quick to get a scene up and running 
Great - thanks!
Clone an existing site. Make an auction website, or a blog or something then you don't have to worry so much about decision making. 
Are you able to help me out with one of my other projects? I need to do square root and squared in a float and int, and I need to do overloading.
It might be beneficial if you look for some Unity starting tutorials.
Afaik, there's no need to implement much there - there should already be an implementation.
Not sure why you're getting two outputs to console, you'll need to show more code. Your second question is to just create the function "whatever" again but with an int argument instead.
Where's the code that instantiates your class?
You never replied to my question. And no we don't have a book, we have a powerpoint presentation that shows us basic functions. It may be clear for you but I have almost no idea what I'm supposed to be doing.
I don't know what that means? 
This is what my powerpoint tells me. All C# function declarations follow the same structure: returntype FunctionName ( inputs ) {} E.g. void SayHello(string Name) {}
Haha Fml I had the code set to my object twice.... Spent an hour trying to figure out the problem. Now I just need to add the other data types and add a function that squares what i want.
What you are supposed to be doing? Get a book. Read about the basics, the fundamentals, of the language you're using. That's likely also what is **expected** of you: Get your ass up and show more initiative. PowerPoint presentations are not an adequate way to teach anything. You did not ask a question, so what should I reply to? You just said that it would probably be something like that, that you have an example and that you have no idea about the other types. No questions in here, just statements. But if you need more hand-holding, here are the responses: 1. Yes. Adapt this to the example from point 2. Instead of `FunctionName` you have `Square`. And the method should not just return the `input`, but do something with it. It should take the square in the method, and return the result. 2. Well, that exactly shows how you're supposed to do it (overloading). Your current code shows nothing like this. You do not have two methods with the same name and different arguments. 3. **Look up** what **numeric** data types C# has to offer. Then write overloaded methods for those data types too. I clearly said you need to write a **function** (aka method) named `Square`, and **you did not even do that**. Do you even know what a method is? There is no shame in not knowing things when learning. But there is shame in not asking when you don't know something. If you have no clue what the response is talking about, **ask** about that specifically. Say you don't know a method, and that issue can be clarified first. You can't solve complex mathematical equations if you can't even do simple division.
Nah I think I'll just get mad at you for trying to help. Screw you and your helpful ways!
A webshop. if you act like orders have to be paid and delivered and stuff, could be very interesting.
What's your background in CS?
This is why I'm asking for help, because I don't know what I'm doing. And I don't see my lecturer until tomorrow so I may as well try find other ways of learning. Searching up things such as Overloading in general doesn't help since Monodevelop does things a little different to Visual Studio. I'm trying to understand but It's super hard since I don't learn from just looking at lines of code. Here's what I've done so far again; http://i.imgur.com/N5aaRgO.png Am I on the right track? I have a list of data types, I just need to learn from one example before I move onto the next, alright? I did the 3rd highest mathematics class in year 12 and mathematics for Diploma Civil Construction Design, so the Maths part is easy, It's the converting it to code that is confusing me.
None, Never done CS before this course and it's doing my head in trying to understand it.
Ah, ok. I'll try to dig up some resources you should check out when I get to a computer in the evening. I think it'll help you a lot if you have a good understanding of how to write simple programs.
I don't see why you wouldn't use Identity. You basically have everything you need with identity. Secure password hashing, roles OAuth 2.0 and it's really not that hard to learn and customize. I don't think you will losee that much time learning Identity.
Yes you're on the right track. FYI - there's no need to name the parameter "input2" in your second overload. Just name it "input". You won't have a name collision - declaring a method starts a new naming scope. You can also move the input variables (int input = 9;, etc) into the Start method. Right now they are declared at the class level, and that's too broad. Keep going. 
That is the right track. I would not declare any fields, and just pass constants directly: Debug.Log(Square(5)); // int Debug.Log(Square(5f)); // float Debug.Log(Square(5.0)); // double
But how do I see different numbers for each function in the console?
There is no difference, the format is always `(type) (name) = (value)`, the value part being optional. `int[]` says the type should be an int array, and `= new int[5]` says it should contain an int array with a length of 5. The array size is intentionally independent from the static type of the variable in C#. For example, you could do something like this: int[] values; if (someCondition) values = new int[10]; else values = new int[20]; You can save some repetition by using the `var` keyword, which statically infers the type of the value: `var numbers = new int[5]` is equivalent to `int[] numbers = new int[5];` `int` is special in that its value can be declared via literals in the source (e.g. "5"), the same goes for strings, booleans and other numeric types. All other types need to be created with the `new` keyword (ignoring some value type stuff for the sake of simplicity).
Yes, it's irritating. I don't know if there's a better fix, but I usually just edit the .csproj file.
Firstly sorry for the delayed response. So what i came up with in checking out your code is basically the same thing outcomehazy did, What you were trying to Parse was HTML and it was not valid XML so i did a little digging up on xkcd and they have a JSON service for getting the metadata for comic's. I have not provided a complete solution to your issues and my app is designed with the thought that it runs say with a service such as windows scheduler once per day to download the daily comic, That said there are far more elegant ways of achieving your goals than what my solution provides i have tried to keep it as simple as i could so that its easy to understand. My solution: https://github.com/setkeh/xkcdBot I hope this helps you out :)
This is an issue because you're trying to use Unity which can make things a bit more complicated/awkward for gathering input. Is there a particular reason you're using Unity over a basic Console application? For learning purposes, especially at this fundamental level, it really does muddy the waters and make it more difficult. For now, to get the best of both worlds, modify your `Start` method to take the input from the Unity inspector and pass it into the functions: int integerInput = 9; float floatInput = 4f; int Square(int input) { return input * input; } float Square(float input) { return input * input; } void Start() { Debug.Log(Square(integerInput)); Debug.Log(Square(floatInput)); }
Sorry, should of said. unload the project, edit the .csproj and look for anything with "package" in it like this: &lt;HintPath&gt;..\packages\StackExchange.Redis.1.0.488\lib\net45\StackExchange.Redis.dll&lt;/HintPath&gt; it's the ..\ here that is now wrong. So you need to change it to the correct path. Now. The correct path is the packages directory for the destination solution. It may not include your package (redis in the example above), so just install it temporarily in another project of the solution first to get it loaded, or copy it over. Make sense?
I think my lecturer wants to see that I can do full coding?
Wow thanks! 😀
Didn't know that, cheers for the heads up, it's handy to know. 
Done it! Thanks. I had never really looked at Url.Action. Now I'm going to use it for literally all links, I see no point to the Action methods. Pretty redundant. The new MVC has much better "tag helpers" for making links as you can see in the first code section I posted.
Not a book, but https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.sockets.udpclient(v=vs.110).aspx should get you started
Start with learning the language and a simpler project.
Shoot for the stars, but don't **begin** with the stars. Before doing stunts with your bike you better learn to ride it first.
This month it's called ASP.NET Core MVC. The runtime is .NET Core and the web framework is ASP.NET Core. EF is EF Core and so on. 
first you need a developer account for twitter, which will secondly provide you with authorisation keys to access the twitter API (the application programming interface to use twitter features in your own application) at last you can write a simple application with a text input field in c#. your application is communicating with the twitter api, e.g. test if the current content of the text input has changed in the last hour and if it has been changed, post the text as a new tweed to your twitter account. this is not an easy task to complete.
Here's a suggestion... As others have stated you are biting off too much for a beginner. I would break the application into parts and make a smaller less complicated application for each part. Create and an application that runs every hour and logs to file. Create an app that can read tweets. Create an application that can write tweets... Etc. The important part is to make all these applications as console apps. Understand and hone the functionality. Then you can transfer that knowledge to a more complex experience. Basically take every step you don't know how to do and make a small console app and learn how to do that thing. THEN learn how to make all these steps work together. 
c# Twitter APIs already exist, so don't create that part from scratch. 
This is completely confusing and mostly wrong explanation. &gt; If you create a int variable, it gets the value 0. If you create an array, it will contain "null" This is not true for local variables, only for fields (which are sometimes also called member variables). Unassigned local variables don't have a value at all. &gt; By doing "new" it reserves the memory area That is true for reference types, but `new` can be used for value types too: `new DateTime(2016, 3, 13)` or even `new int()` (which is a really weird way to write `0`).
I had looked through a couple but they showed what appeared to be the unity editor, and as I had already installed the Unity add-in for VS I had wrongly assumed that I would be working entirely within VS and was confused about not being able to find a Unity Project within VS.
Get a twitter api (I used tweetsharp for my old client), implement it into the program read the file and put it in a string (if it's one lined) and then look into your api documentation how to send a tweet. You'll also need a developer account but usually any api explains this. Edit: I'll add some more explanation when I get home. Currently on mobile. Okay. I'll give you an rough example with Tweetsharp. * [Go here and login with your Twitter account and create a new app. it can be anything](https://apps.twitter.com/) be sure to save the access token and don't share it! * Create a c# project and implement [Tweetsharp](https://github.com/danielcrenna/tweetsharp) * For further steps you'll have to decide if you want that the program only uses your twitter account or if can be used by anyone upon logging in. (hard coding vs OOP) for your account hard coded use [those first 5 lines of code](https://github.com/danielcrenna/tweetsharp#hello-twitter) [otherwise take this method, which is also more advanced.](https://github.com/danielcrenna/tweetsharp#authenticating-a-client-application-ie-desktop) The following steps depends on your concept which isn't too good explained and hard to tell. Basicly you could create a tray application (NotifyIcon) which runs in the background and runs down a timer every 1h. On the timer tick you'd want to have a function to read from a text file. The way you read it also depends on how the file is written (1 tweet only, 1 per line..). After you got your tweet text you want to tweet in a string use it like this. TwitterStatus SendTweet(new SendTweetOptions { Status = tweetFromFile }); // tweetFromFile is the string where your tweet is stored. After you got your tweet sent it should be all working since it's the only thing it does.
I know one can use 'new' with value types. But it is never required, afaik. Reference types require it, or a value, or you get a null reference exception when trying to read its content. But i did not know there was a difference in how to initialize a member variable vs a local variable. Please explain.
what?
Enterprise will only go with Core for newer projects.
I agree, it just looks like the .NET org got taken over by a couple of overzealous nodejs programmers who wanted to re-invent the entire ecosystem in nodejs's image and what you end up with is a cheap copy of nodejs that doesn't do nearly as much as it does, so why bother with .NET Core? Might as well just use nodejs. They have zero upgrade path for existing apps... they are continually lying about the state of the project, calling what is clearly an alpha-quality version as a "release candidate". I think it's going to be a massive flop.
If you need flexible deployment, just use nodejs now.
&gt; But i did not know there was a difference in how to initialize a member variable vs a local variable. Please explain. Well try this: class Program { static int field; static void Main() { int local; Console.WriteLine(field); Console.WriteLine(local); } } While writing `field` will print `0` as you seem to expect, writing `local` like this will fail to compile.
For the record, I switched *from* node.js to .NET Core for my [startup](http://www.petscribe.com.au). * Even though I used Typescript, it was difficult to maintain a common object schema between the UI, Server API and Database. * Deployment was equally simple for both, but I was always running into too-long-pathnames with node_modules. * I used knex and bookshelf for database access, but they were very limited in the kinds of schema migrations and maintentance tasks they could perform. I'm using [EF7](https://ef.readthedocs.org/en/latest/platforms/coreclr/getting-started-linux.html) now, and things are much easier now. * Razor &gt; jade Node was fine, but I just find it more pleasant to work with C#.
There will be legacy code running ye old .net for ages. But I think .net core is the way of the future. Sure hell it won't be as polished as the current .net, nor will it contain or offer the same functionality either for a while. But that is not the point, the point of .net core is to offer a way of running your application on any platform with only the things you need. In time Core will offer us everything we need, but until then it will be a rough and a exciting ride
Thanks for answers. I think I'll go with auction site. Here is Github for it: https://github.com/maavburton/DDDAttempt
Why would you expect that to work? .Net Core has a completely separate CLR and completely separate libraries. If you want to make a project that works under both, you can. But you can't just expect to run your old code under Core.
Good advice 
Not true. .NET Core supports the full .NET Framework as well as .NET Core. http://docs.asp.net/en/latest/getting-started/choosing-the-right-dotnet.html
Well. Tell that to whoever implemented how all those cogs work together in VS, because I spent hours on it and came to the conclusion it's not possible. Deliberately, possibly.
http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ASPNET5IsDeadIntroducingASPNETCore10AndNETCore10.aspx Right there in the image. Basically Microsoft have "arranged it" so that the tooling in VS does NOT allow MVC 6 to run on .NET Full despite claims otherwise.
I'd wait with Angular2 until it supports the TSX files. Without that I rather stick to ReactJS.
There's a lot of anecdotal negativity being thrown around this thread, so I thought I'd describe some of the facts about ASP.NET Core and .NET Core. 1. ASP.NET Core is built with .NET Core, which is a re-implementation of the .NET Framework - just not a full one. You won't get the full set of .NET Framework APIs at this point, but you will easily get 90% of the most common ones. 2. ASP.NET Core is minimalist by design, but that doesn't mean that it's not close to full featured. There's a lot of feature parity between that and ASP.NET 4.6 with some minor improvements. The only real thing that it lacks at this point is community extensions, but those will come as Core matures. 3. You can indeed use the full .NET Framework with ASP.NET Core. It's as simple as changing a configuration option in your [project.json](https://github.com/aspnet/Home/wiki/Project.json-file). To answer your question about Angular 2 and ASP.NET Core, I think they will be a potent combination. I feel that C# is a better backend language in comparison to something like JS and Node, which is essentially what ASP.NET Core is - a Node-esque experience using C# (a bit of an oversimplification because ASP.NET Core has so much more out of the box.) (Not to say that Node is bad - I just prefer ASP.NET Core.) (Shameless plug - I'll be teaching an 8 hour workshop on Angular 2 plus ASP.NET Core at a few conferences throughout the year ([KCDC](http://kcdc.info) is the first confirmed one) so if anyone is more curious about the combination, please visit. I'm also working on a video/blog series but that's a ways away at this point.)
no junior programmer will be expected to know IoC - that's a pretty complex topic that many seasoned devs haven't mastered
I'm a junior and I've used it a lot
Then you're well ahead of the curve 
.NET Core is definitely going to be on the rise in the coming years, but I'd say that React has way more potential than Angular 2. It's backed by Facebook and used extensively in their production apps, whereas the same can't be said for Angular/Google.
You're right. But now I tried it, and it does work. If you create a new ASP.NET Core Project in VS, you need to edit project.json to remove .Net Core (`frameworks`-&gt;`dnxcore50`). After that, adding a dependency on normal .Net 4 class library works fine.
To grok CQRS/ES for myself I went with a shipping company model. Start with the events of booking a collection, then events for when a parcel is collected, arrives/departs from a depot, is consolidated into a container, container is added to a ship, passes customs, etc. etc.
What code do you have written so far?
Don't use an if. Use max 0. Math.Max((numbooks - 6), 0) times 20m, etc.
Try sending an email via SMTP via Core, then tell us we can use the full .NET Framework. Lots of other examples of limitations; this is an easy one.
SomeControl.Load is an event. (sender, args) =&gt; {Widget.OnInitalized(args);} is an anonymous function that is being registered as an event handler for SomeControl.Load. When the SomeControl.Load event is raised, the anonymous function will be executed in that thread. [Events](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa645739%28v=vs.71%29.aspx) [Lambda syntax](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397687.aspx) (the anonymous function syntax used in you code snippet)
thats the problem, i have tried things such as http://pastebin.com/gUwg5Ypb (however this only is in a class, not the main) but to get it working is part of the problem the only concepts that i am aware of are loops, classes, and other basic programming concepts. 
To add onto /u/Canthros' reply, your snippet is equivalent to the more traditional implementation: SomeControl.Load += InitializeWidget; .... private void InitializeWidget(object sender, EventArgs args) { Widget.OnInitalized(args); }
So the second column is actual number of adult pairs, I guess.
It's called MailKit. Look it up.
I would want the superior product to have the highest mind share, so the whole community would benefit. I wouldn't want "mind share" to be the determining factor for which is more dominant, by the way, Angular blows away React when it comes to mind share, based on google trends, and overall projects created. Also, React is a library, and Angular is a front end framework, that's why you feel it is doing so much. Angular contains services which allows you to "mold" and create reusable components as well. 
If you are going to be printing out the data as you go, you probably only need to keep the current numbers. So you just need to look at the numbers each month. Every baby pair seems to need a month to grow up before they are adult, but another month before they can have babies, right? So every month, you want to : increase the month number, set an internal variable to the number of last months babies (maybe call it TooYoung) add the number of last months babies to adults set the number of babies based on number of adults minus TooYoung. print out the chart row. And put all of that in a loop that breaks when it hits a total more than 500. 
i'm curious as to what data you're referencing to believe that angular is losing to react or to believe that react is becoming as dominant of a framework as jquery. granted this article is a year old at this point, but http://www.developereconomics.com/comparison-4-popular-javascript-mv-frameworks-part-2/ since you're talking about mind share, google trends is a pretty good indicator of that: https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=angular%20js%2Creact%20js js isn't technically in react's name, so the graph may not be wholly accurate, but it's nearly impossible to qualify react in a better way; everything just gets polluted by that whole recent youtube reaction video fiasco. edit: 2016 stack overflow survey results are in http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016, angular still appears to be far more popular than react.
YouTube reaction video fiasco? I think I missed that. Do you have a link?
Lmao. Seriously, care to back up any of your suggestions or are you trolling? 
The very simplest way to get you started is to read/write some basic text to a text file, and it sounds like you're already thinking along those lines. The simplest methods to look for to accomplish this are: * [`File.Exists`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.file.exists%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) * [`File.WriteAllText`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms143375%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) * [`File.ReadAllText`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms143368%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) Give those methods a shot. Just be sure to use a file path that you have security permissions to read/write with.
Really? I've found it really pretty good. And this is with a reasonably complex application (MVC and Web API, interfacing with Service Bus &amp; Storage &amp; DocumentDb on Azure, authentication with OpenId Connect, replaced the dependency injection with Autofac and the logging with Serilog, etc) 
While I am sympathetic to those who get a bit confused when trying new things, I find considering whether I might be wrong instead of major corporations outright lying to be useful in truth-seeking. 
If you had tried to find a sample project it would have been immediately apparent that you had badly misapprehended the situation. 
Please don't post this **low quality blog spam** here.
For more constructive criticism, you probably shouldn't talk much about `ArrayList` these days, as it's a pre-.NET 2.0 non-generic collection type that should never be used anymore. Its replacement would be `List&lt;T&gt;`, not `Array`. There are still uses for `Array`, but most people should really not use that either.
Some guys that created youtube videos in the format "Foo reacts to bar" wanted to trademark the word "react" which started an internet shitstorm. 
With its inferior generic typing system? Ha!
I would recommend Hanselminutes podcast as it covers a wide variety of topics like web development, UX, open source, etc. In my opinion it's motivating and it's generally good for getting to know new topics that you can discover later on in greater depth. It's also worth mentioning that Scott, the author of the podcast, can explain literally anything in the simplest and fun way.
Why not use System.Numerics.Vectors instead of SFML?
The point of core is that it's lean and mean, you only need the components that you use - if you don't use a feature, there's no overhead from it because of how it's designed. So yeah, there's no mail client in CoreFx. That's by design. You're supposed to pull one in from NuGet - like MailKit. If you want to scoff at that, remember that all the ASP libraries get pulled in from Nuget as well.
Writing blog posts are an _excellent_ way to improve both one's English and their C#.NET knowledge. I don't think we should ever discourage people from doing so if their intent is in the right place. That said, we are trying to curate a higher quality of blog submissions here. Perhaps /u/neetpaliwal, you can find a mentor on /r/programmingbuddies who you can sound off on or have check your blog posts for accuracy and comprehensiveness before submitting them to public criticism?
System.Numerics.Vectors has the advantage of being hardware accelerated on .NET 4.6 and Core, and since it's not a native library like SFML there is no context switching penalty.
Removed, Rule 7. As pointed out by the other comments, we try to have blog submissions be generally beneficial to the readers of /r/csharp, and unfortunately in its current state, this blog post isn't quite there yet. Or in the worst case, might encourage people learning the language to use archaic classes (`ArrayList` instead of `List&lt;&gt;`).
You can have WebAPI controllers in an MVC project. You need an MVC project anyway(assuming other technologies like nodejs are not an option), so just use that.
Thank you so much! This is exactly what I was looking for. A few questions: &gt;QuadTree.cs, 32: Do not abbreviate argument names. What's wrong with just called it tree or treeToBeInserted instead of t? Your code should be expressive, not obfuscated. 't' isn't supposed to be an abbreviation for 'tree' - t is the object you're using the tree with. Insert is how you add objects into the tree. Would you still call it something else? &gt;QuadTree.cs, 42: Why does this method return a List&lt;T&gt; for a query operation? IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; would be much more suitable. What's the benefit of returning IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; vs List&lt;T&gt;? &gt;QuadTree.cs, 65: This method is kinda backwards. You create a list for each node, then add each nodes list to another list. Uhm, what? You should create one list, and add all elements to this list. And why not use IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; here? How would I do that with recursion? Pass the list I'm going to return in the parameter? &gt;Why is Count not a property with a getter? If it's costly, document it and name it to something like GetCount. If not, make it a property. It's good practice to keep this naming pattern for methods: Verb+Noun. So if it's costly you should make it a method? And if it isn't a property? I'm not sure why I didn't make it a get property in the first place. &gt;QuadTree.cs, 98: Sometimes you're using this., sometimes not. I see that you use it here because of the overlapping name. Often the fields are prefixed with _ to avoid this, and then you can stick to a pattern (always use this. or never use it). Is it bad to sometimes use '_'? For example, would this be bad? public QuadTree(FloatRect _bounds, int maximumDepth, int maximumNodeCount) &gt;QuadTree.cs, 100: What does the 0 stand for? Without extensive editor support I have no idea. I need to look at the constructor... Why not use named arguments for this? Writing currentDepth: 0 is much more expressive than 0. Alternative have a local constant named CurrentDepththat you then pass to the method. Do you mean it's less expensive to do currentDepth: 0? If you do mean what you said, why would I want to use something more expensive? &gt;QuadTreeNode.cs, 39: This is a very big and costly getter. This should rather be a method. Getters should be fast. Adding integers are expensive for properties? Or is it because it uses recursion that could make it expensive? It's still only just adding integers. &gt;QuadTreeNode.cs, 44: Prevent bugs like the famous goto-fail. Always use code blocks! I'm not sure what this means. By code blocks do you mean regions? What does regions have to do with checking if something is null? &gt;QuadTreeNode.cs, 173: Very very long lines. Better split them up. I think a line length limit of 120 characters is nice to read. I tried with newDepth, position, and newSize :(. Do you think breaking the constructors into two lines is a bad thing to do? &gt;QuadTreeNode.cs, 182: Two nested foreach with an if inside, kinda smells bad. It seems like you do too much in this method and it can further be broken down. So even though this will only be called in CreateChildNodes() you'd still make into its own method? So the rule of thumb is split methods into smaller ones if it gets too large, you're going to reuse it more than once, or a part of it is really performance intensive? &gt;QuadTreeNode.cs, 184: There should be no reason to constantly call ToList() on the content. Especially not for every child node. I did this because if I don't it throws, "Collection was modified; enumeration operation may not execute". Should I find another way to fix that error? &gt;QuadTreeNode.cs, 344: Why do you create a new list in line 340, when you're gonna replace it with the content list anyway? Avoid unnecessary allocations. So I should do the new after the first if statement in GetAllObjects()? &gt;Your formatting overall is very very inconsistent. You mean naming? My formatting in terms of spacing seems consistent to me. Thanks a bunch for your help! You've given me the most useful information out of this project.
If I am starting development on an entirely new product, is .Net Core the way to go over .Net Framework? .Net Framework is more fully featured, right? But will it still be maintained or is .Net Core the future? There are no cross-platform plans, and this is primarily a desktop program.
Removed, Rule 3. Interesting question though. Maybe give it a whirl over at /r/programmerchat. Off the top of my head, Jurassic Park (the book) had a bit throughout the book on Chaos Theory and fractals. Maybe that can inspire you to dive into programming those concepts.
I just gave a cursory glance at the project and am making assumptions on some his (/u/AngularBeginner) comments. &gt;Is it bad to sometimes use '_'? For example, would this be bad? I usually prefix private variables in my class with underscores. &gt;Do you mean it's less expensive to do currentDepth: 0? If you do mean what you said, why would I want to use something more expensive? Expressive! Not expensive! :) &gt;Adding integers are expensive for properties? Or is it because it uses recursion that could make it expensive? It's still only just adding integers. Getters should be simple. Even though it's only adding integers, it should not be doing a lot of work. It should either be pre-computed, or, made a function. &gt;I did this because if I don't it throws, "Collection was modified; enumeration operation may not execute". Should I find another way to fix that error? You should try and figure out the root cause of the error rather than applying a bandage that is quite expensive in terms of object allocation. Not to mention your code will perform slower because you're constantly creating new lists in memory and adding all the objects to those lists! &gt;You mean naming? My formatting in terms of spacing seems consistent to me. I assume he means whitespace/indentation?
Your question as it is, I think is too vague for anyone to come up with a fix. I suggest you remake the project, rewrite it and check step-by-step as you rewrite it. Once you perform a step and the GUI gets wonky, then you'll have a much better idea of what's causing it. If you still don't understand why that step is causing the issue, maybe ask about it then.
Can't believe no one has mentioned [.Net Rocks!](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/) yet. If you're interested in SQL Server, check out the [SQL Data Partners podcast](http://sqldatapartners.com/podcast/) or if you're looking for really hardcore DBA stuff, Brent Ozar Unlimited have turned their weekly Office Hours webcast into a [podcast as well](https://www.brentozar.com/itunes/).
I like checking http://themorningbrew.net/ at least once a week for interesting developments in the world of .Net.
You're likely executing a blocking loop or method (while reading or waiting for connections etc.) on the main thread, which will prevent the UI from updating. If that's the case, you need to move that code to a new parallel thread, or rewrite it using non-blocking async methods.
Actually, I have a code for connection, that I thought I put on a separate thread. Thanks!
"I've been doing this for 20 years." That's the argument that you've chosen to side with... I started web development like a few months ago, and you can't even make a proper rebuttal at me.... That's why sucky tools gain mind share because people don't properly understand nor discuss topics at a high level - instead have their head up their ass. I don't care if I'm wrong, I just want to benefit and learn something from this conversion, but people write "20 years exp bro, that's why I'm right". I am a college student with limited experience in ReactJS but decent in AngularJS, but this doesn't mean I'm not good enough to discuss something with you. How is React winning? Angular is more popular, but again, can't be comparable, and I wanted to ask why they think React is more dominant but can't get a reasonable answer
I wish I could go with Core for my new projects but we use Oracle DB here and since they haven't released ODP.net compiled against core I have to target the full .net framework. Though I'm looking forward to the flexibility of being able to use docker containers to host my app. Someday.
Making things automated, like you click a button and it does many, many things
I would need to serve these pages and support ssl + windows auth, is that possible while using a web api project ?
Its reliance on the Common Language Runtime and garbage collection for memory management means it's unusable or at least unsuitable for low level programming (e.g. drivers) and low-power embedded devices.
Count me in. I'll watch anything by Scott Allen.
I take back all the ad hominem attacks, I just realized that they are pretty poisonous in any reddit discussion. I'm just tired of people not being able to answer the "why" behind what they state. I replied to everything you mentioned regarding Angular and React and you didn't really give me an answer back. When this happens, it is naturally assumed that the other person doesn't know what they are talking about. I shouldn't get down voted for confronting someone's opinion of things.... confrontation and challenging of ideas and beliefs is what propels web technology forward. It also allows the superior tools to naturally become the dominant tools. I have nothing against React and Angular. I just wanted to understand in what way React was "winning", which I still don't know.
Frankly, I doubt that. Most of the development and information is available online or in the Jabbr chat. And there's still so much that needs to be fleshed out. The transition to the dotnet CLI is not even complete. And he surely needed some time to create and edit this video material. I suspect (I don't have PluralSight, I can't check) that this is actually related to ASP.NET 5 RC1, and not to ASP.NET Core.
I addressed my ad hominem attacks. I won't be using them anymore, they're actually never really valid, so they should be taken with a grain of salt. I won't be using them anymore. He mentioned ad hominem attacks then calls me a little piece of shit for me saying he doesn't know what he's talking about because he didn't reply to my statements confronting his statements, but starts talking about his xx years of experience. I hope my "I think you have no idea what you are talking about" quote doesn't become the focus of this thread...
Division by zero has been found to be unreliable.
He got a sweet deal getting in pluralsight from the ground floor as a commissioned author. He's made millions from pluralsight. 
If you can do what you need to do with nodejs, that might be the way to go. I've never done windows auth in a website, and I assume that part will be simpler on an MVC site than any other stack. If you just mean that you need an authentication system, that can be done in most/all web stacks.
Okay, you seem to be confusing two different things here. You're talking about .net Core development in general, which is why you're bringing in everything about the toolchain (DNX etc.) - however, as I said: &gt; **if you're developing with visual studio** (as Scott is doing so in this video) and not the donet CLI, things are more or less the same. Remember this, because although .net core is cross platform with the core CLI, this particular course is geared specifically at Windows/Visual Studio development, which doesn't change much for you between the two. In fact, the only thing from your list that's really relevant is the schema of the global.json file (and even that's a relatively minor change), however given that the focus of this is ASP.net and not just .net core development, then yes I stand by my 99% claim because ASP.net is still ASP.net, whether you call it 5/RC1 or Core 1.0 - Middleware, Controlllers, EF, Identity, Razor and absolutely everything from the front end is the same as it was before. That's why RC1 was claimed to be supported in production (And yes I admit that was premature), because *asp.net core* is stable enough to use, even if DNX/*.net Core* was not. EDIT: Just to remind you, you're arguing against this course without having actually watched the damn thing. Maybe save your opinions until after you've seen it (go grab a free trial from Microsoft if you must).
If you catch that exception, then you can do ANYTHING with it. 
An infinite number of things, even.
Interesting stuff, I was just talking with someone on IRC the other day about C#'s lack of support for higher-kinded types. I'd still rather have MI though. :P
Not wanting to sound trollish, but asking on reddit how to do your class assignement isn't really a good way to learn...
It currently can't handle implementations of quantum algorithms, as it lacks a native qubit data type.
Or equally possibly a negative infinity of things :)
This happens sometimes when you execute GUI stuff on a non-GUI thread. For example, your form may be hooked into certain events fired by the server and/or client. When these events fire, they will call a function in your form, but you will be running in a different thread than the message loop thread. In this case, you have several options. For example: 1. Use InvokeRequired and BeginInvoke to push the event onto the message loop. 2. Push the message into some sort of queue that you manage (remember to lock it), and then service this queue in a winforms timer. 
Sounds like a challenge to me!
What he said ^
Did you know the restriction on throwing only exceptions is a language-level feature? The CLR will allow you to throw any object.
&gt; Comments are echoes along the timeline from future refactorings pleading to be born Kent Beck
Again, you're adamanent that a course on the fundementals of ASP.net core should focus on .net core itself - and this is where we disagree. You don't get a full rundown of the .net Framework on an ASP.net 4.5 fundementals course because that's out of scope. Yes, .net core is all new and exciting and it's worth having a background on that, but that's a different course. ASP.net is very much its own thing, the fact that ASP.net core sits on top of .net Core is only marginally relevant in this context. Everything in this course will be just as relevant now as when RC2/1.0 final actually drops. If your real issue is the name of the course, then fair enough - but the confusion with the naming lies squarely with Microsoft. A lot of people (including those on this sub) aren't aware of the distinction between core and full .net, so when RC2 does drop and it's called "ASP.net Core 1.0", that's what people are going to be looking for courses for.
Aren't red squiggly lines errors in your code....
Have you tried the tab key? I'm not 100% sure, but I think that's the one, and for some completions you can hit it multiple times to cycle through your options, like different methods on an object or something.
The red underlining is due to errors in code detected by Intelli-Sense. It doesn't hurt anything if it shows up while you're writing sections of code but if you want to avoid seeing it there are a few tricks you can use to prevent it for longer stretches, such as pre-typing close quotes/parens/brackets/braces. If Iintelli-Sense is such a boon that you're basically asking how to disable it, then using VS at all becomes a bit moot - you're just as well off using notepad++ and compiling manually using cl.exe at that point.
tab or space, if the autocomplete option you want is already selected in the AC Dropdown. I use tab, personally.
There goes 6 months of wasted time I won't get back!
In my experience, I've have only good things to say about using [Selenium WebDriver](http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/) with Firefox (I haven't tried it with Chrome, but I imagine it's fine too). That combined with HtmlAgilityPack should be a good starting place. Also, with FireBug you can quickly and easily get the XPath (to use in scraping) of HTML elements; very useful when learning how to write XPaths and an invaluable time saver.
Search for HTMLAgilityPack, there's a lot out there already. If you're not familiar with XPath I'd focus on that first.
Awesome! Many thanks again to whoever posted here a few months ago and got us hooked up with free ms-&gt;pluralsight memberships :)
My advice, as a C# developer, who has recently scraped a load of web pages, is: do it another way: What's the easiest and most powerful way to query nodes in a webpage? jQuery. If you know node.js/JavaScript you can use jsdom to load a web pages into the DOM query them with jQuery. Far easier than any other technique I've ever used. https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom You can find several Chrome add-ins which helps you find the jQuery selectors for elements on a page. If you don't know node.js, it's worthwhile learning a bit anyway...it's a great tool to have in your arsenal.
Okay, I installed it and it works, but I want to make an application with a GUI too, and doing that in pure JS is impossible. 
ahhh...I was kinda thinking more of scraping as one job, and displaying data/having your GUI as another job. e.g, I scrape my data via node, put it in a DB, then have a seperate website display the data
Honestly, websites that override the browser scroll behavior are fucking annoying.
Isn't this just use of CSS position: fixed? That's been done a lot longer than the newer, and really annoying, actual hijacking of scrolling.
What do you mean by free MS-&gt;pluralsight membership?
Chain your appends! sb.Append( "just" ) .Append( "like" ) .Append( "this" );
MS was offering free pluralsight memberships to developers getting Azure accounts.
Got it, is this still going on?
C# is perfectly fine for WebDev. Actually it's my fav language for server side programming. However Sillicon Valley is "Hip" and only use hipster programming languages.
It certainly can be if you find a shop using modern C# and ASP.Net MVC as opposed to something like Web Forms. The language is plenty modern, the companies that use it more often aren't. At least in comparison to the "hip" stacks like Node.
Their parents nuts. edit: They drive their parents nuts... no? ok :c
C# is an industrial-strength language that is widely used for enterprise development. It's not glamorous and it's seldom employed by startups, so you won't read about it much. But if you go and look at job postings, they will tell you a different story. Just look at how often C#/ASP.NET/MVC is mentioned.
"after coming back". Where is back for you?
Nodejs is pretty common for "isomorphic" solutions. Honestly I prefer java over c# for web dev, not because c# the language isn't way better than java (it is) but because the java ecosystem is second to none. That said, I can see that changing in a big way as Microsoft pushes for more and more open source goodness while Oracle slowly kills java through stupid litigation, horrible commercial features, and decreased development.
I think if you're strong with C#, JavaScript, and are familiar with some of the various frameworks for both (MVC, EF, etc for C#, jQuery, Angular, etc for JavaScript), you'll be in good shape. Very generally speaking, and I'm not sure if this applies specifically to the SV area or not, having good JavaScript front-end skills coupled with good C# back-end skills will position you well for web-dev jobs.
17 years of working as a developer / engineer and C# is my go-to language. Most of the large corporations I have worked for are all Microsoft shops. Hell, even most of the smaller companies I have worked for are all about .NET. The only time I have run into the hipster programming crowd has been when I was interviewing at ad agencies years ago. I feel c# or vb.net is a prerequisite for ANY development job at a large company. 
Yes. https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-dev-essentials-vs.aspx
While I agree with you on almost all accounts I don't share your pessimism for the future. 2 years from now it will be usable and the killer feature will be performance. I still can't help but think the plan will do more damage than they could have done had they thought of some migration path and taking it slowly but with more quality. For example they might have built just the Web API part of MVC6 and focused on higher quality, better EF and other libraries for the first release.
Ok, don't anyone do any of that. Just a PSA. 
dependency file is longer then all the code written!
It's not just a lack of glamour. Let's face it: ASP.NET is better for Line of Business apps (often CRUD apps) that are using web technologies in established ways. The .NET ecosystem is smaller than that of open-source web stacks such as Node and Java, and it focuses more on traditional use cases. Bleeding-edge web apps are easier to construct using open source tools, and they have more active (and experimental) communities. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. Microsoft's main source of revenue has long been the enterprise, and it shows in the design and state of their tooling.
The valley skews towards start-ups and pure technology companies, which in turn skew to free (and usually cutting edge / flavor of the month) technologies for development. Conversely, in most of the rest of the country where most programmers are hired not by pure tech companies but businesses that have a need for programming to solve some kind of business problem, C# and Java are waaaaaay more prevalent. In my city there are perennially more C# jobs than any other programming language, and I get called by recruiters constantly trying to fill them.
Wow, the only comment here that actually tries to address that part of OP's question and it's downvoted. It could very well be geography. If there aren't a lot of C# jobs in their area, that's not just Silicon Valley rejecting it. All that matters is if OP can find a job and wants to learn it. No need for a bunch of "What, this old bucket of rust? Oh I guess it's not one of them newfangled hippity hoppity bippity boppity languages, but it keeps up."

Removed: Rule 8.
But it fits nicely into a man bun sized file when we compile! 
Bleeding edge is client side-ish these days. What kind of boost in productivity are you gaining with "open source tools" for backend? Maybe I could see meteor as a productivity tool, for data synchronization. But I made my own meteor in C# in a week. ;)
Probably because of SOLID /Separation of Concerns.
Yeah it almost seems like everything has to be done in JavaScript nowadays to be cool. Just imagine you told someone 10 years ago that someone is going to build a js webserver... Next thing: js OS!
I remembering doing a google search about that some time ago and I saw it pop up. Not sure what it was, though
I think I'm separating concerns. The server side web methods talk to Factory classes that make calls to EF/LINQ/System.IO, etc. EF natively supports prototyping, so I allow it, unless I need something more robust in which case I'll create the necessary prototypes. aspx.cs contains accessible web methods, the JS Factories. (This may be the sticking point but my web methods simply call the factory and return the defined type of the factory) The aspx page contains HTML Controls and CSS absolutely no ASP.NET controls... EVER! From there I use a MVVM framework and JQuery UI for validation. I'm not saying it is right, just curious why it's wrong or how it could be improved. 
Ooh, can I see?
Most web dev is in javascript due to SPA (single page apps) and responsive UI. It's not that the backing can't be C# it's just not going to be the front, so if you don't know javascript yet, start there.
Silicon Valley is "hip" and primarily uses Mac OS X rather than Windows. If you are a OSX/Linux shop, you probably aren't going to choose C#/.NET as your language/framework.
FWIW, I absolutely love C# as a language. LINQ is awesome. Feature-wise, it's ten years ahead of Java. And my day job mostly involves .NET technologies. However, .NET's ecosystem is probably ten years *behind* Java or Python. I think part of the problem is cultural, in that .NET users tend to wait for a canonical solution from Microsoft, rather than developing solutions themselves. OSS projects tend to be abandoned before reaching maturity. See [The Profound Weakness of the .NET OSS Ecosystem](http://www.aaronstannard.com/the-profound-weakness-of-the-net-oss-ecosystem/) and [Why I Left .NET](http://blog.jonathanoliver.com/why-i-left-dot-net/) from a few years ago. Some criticisms are outdated since Microsoft's recent efforts toward open source and cross-platform compatibility began to pick up steam. However, most of the points still hold. But to answer your question about open-source tools for the back end: Hadoop, Spark, and the other popular Big Data tools are written in Java. I work with a lot of geospatial data in ESRI's ArcGIS; Python is the preferred scripting language. I've worked on a few bioinformatics projects, and there are almost no .NET tools available; extensive toolkits exist for Java and Python. I'm not trying to start another tiresome language/platform war, but I'm not blind, either. I love the new direction that Microsoft is taking toward community involvement, Linux options, etc. But the ecosystem will take some time to grow.
It's not really "C#'s style". It's just the default in Visual Studio.
We at least do it using Typescript -&gt; JavaScript (Node.js). Programming such things in pure JavaScript feels like insanity for me.
Here it is [Node OS](https://node-os.com/) 
No real reason. The language is excellent, better than anything else out there IMHO, with the possible exception of fringe languages such as Lisp or F#. It really has to do with the Microsoft brand, which immediately conjures up images of socially-inept corporate drones, as opposed to the lean, fashionable hipsters of the Mac world.
That's still new though. It's not widely know.
From the time you posted this, 16 new versions came out. 
Why so much hostility, man?
Not sure I understand what you're trying to say. I was just asking about where is home for him, so maybe I can connect him to some local startups that hire .Net web devs.
.net ecosystem is smaller than that of node!?
BURN THE HERETIC! /jk
Also, the cost of using the Microsoft stack is high because of licensing. Enterprise Visual Studio, SQL Server, Windows Server, etc. are too expensive for startups. With that said, C# is one of the most widely used languages for large enterprises, and C# jobs are plenty.
Wow, this sub is **almost** as bad as /r/php. Some great answers, but the circle jerk game is strong.
I think a lot of the times companies not using MVC isn't because they're not "Hip" or "with the times" it's because they have some massive existing system built in web/win forms, and don't have the resources or proper management to make the upgrade. They have perfectly capable developers who could work in any framework, and are just trying to maintain existing systems. We've been talking about migrating to MVC for 2 years now, and eventually we will, but it has to make financial sense, and given our current new client load right now, it just doesn't. 
Sounds to me like they are appreciating the novelty of your comment.
I know :( the latest data is behind a paywall 
I don't think its a problem using ASPX pages, its using them for web services. You can just create an ASMX file in your webforms project if you want to use web services. You can then call those webservices from your jQuery ajax code. We cannot use MVC in our solutions, so we use aspx pages, but only because of the functionality master pages bring. If it wasn't for master pages, we'd just use plain old html pages. Hoping to use Angular in my next project.
It is Turing complete, so anything that can be computed can be computed with C#. The only question is how fast the computation takes, or how long it takes to write the code. C# sits in a space where it is slightly easier (arguably) to write code than it would be in C or C++, but also the code will be slightly slower (fact) assuming optimum implementations in both cases. The performance difference will either be completely irrelevant or completely critical depending on your use case. But to put it in context a huge website like stackoverflow uses C# and is capable of serving their content with just 1 server (though they use more for safety) 
Whether the style itself predates C# doesn't matter in the context of what's being discussed. It's a C# style. If I wear polo shirts all the time, that's my style. It doesn't make it less my style that people have done it before me.
I leverage master pages, that's the nice part of the ASPX Pattern. I'm using KO MVVM and the app is built like an SPA. Each "module" Customers, Employees, Quotes, etc use a single page Main.aspx and it contains the necessary WebMethods. If I have a need for a reusable component like Address, Phone, Navigation I create an ASCX. Again, the ASCX only contains HTML and the ascx.cs only contains factory methods extended with the WebMethod decoration. The JS and what is part of the ASCX. It all seems well organized in my opinion. 
.Net can't stay behind! We have to split the whole framework and ASP.NET into a huge number of tiny packages, so that we can have the most dependencies! We will call it, .Net Core, for some reason.
What's the difference? That it was started and is maintained by a corporation?
Really with azure a lot of costs have come down from a deployment perspective, and there is a free version of visual studio.
No joke. I suggested that .NET's third-party ecosystem wasn't as strong *yet* as Python and Java's for some back-end tasks, and got promptly downvoted.
Thanks!
I know it is orthogonal to this topic but I actually enjoy working on deep legacy codebases as long as I am allowed to 1) Upgrade to the latest version of the tech stack. No .NET 2.0! 2) Improve the organization and architecture as I see fit. I promise that we will have new releases and the project will continue to function while I refactor it.
Out of interest, what kind of things? My biggest problem is always around front end, which thanks to say react and the 85 npm modules needed, is bad in almost any framework.
Microsoft has been giving [free stuff for startups](https://www.microsoft.com/bizspark#start-two) before startups were cool
&gt; They aren't super high tech grandiose Silicon Valley websites You mean like this one - http://adventurega.me/bootstrap/
I still don't understand the need for a "PSA" with no explanation.
That wasn't me, but yeah ... I don't get it either.
There is also an eDX course that has just started on C# which might be worth taking a look at [here](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DEV204x+2T2016/info). As stated already, pluralsight is an excellent resource
Why knockout in 2016?
I'm talking actually making a useful app. Okay my current project we are at: "attr-accept": "^1.0.3", "big.js": "^3.1.3", "bootstrap": "^3.3.5", "bootstrap-webpack": "0.0.3", "class-set": "0.0.4", "debounce": "^1.0.0", "es6-promise": "^2.3.0", "history": "^1.11.1", "immutable": "^3.7.4", "jquery": "^2.1.4", "keymirror": "^0.1.1", "moment": "^2.11.2", "moment-timezone": "^0.4.0", "ms-signalr-client": "^2.2.2", "nuclear-js": "^1.0.5", "object-assign": "^3.0.0", "raf": "^3.0.0", "react": "^0.14.0", "react-addons-perf": "^0.14.0", "react-document-title": "^2.0.1", "react-dom": "^0.14.0", "react-portal": "^1.5.5", "react-redux": "^2.1.1", "react-router": "^1.0.0-beta4", "react-select": "^1.0.0-beta11", "react-widgets": "^3.1.7", "redux": "^2.0.0", "redux-logger": "^1.0.6", "redux-router": "^1.0.0-beta3", "redux-thunk": "^1.0.0", "superagent": "^1.2.0" }, "devDependencies": { "babel-core": "^5.5.0", "babel-eslint": "^4.1.3", "babel-loader": "^5.1.3", "babel-runtime": "^5.8.25", "css-loader": "^0.17.0", "eslint": "^1.7.3", "eslint-loader": "^1.1.0", "eslint-plugin-react": "^3.7.1", "file-loader": "^0.8.4", "immutable-devtools": "0.0.4", "json-loader": "^0.5.2", "less": "^2.5.1", "less-loader": "^2.2.0", "node-gyp": "^3.3.0", "node-libs-browser": "^0.5.2", "redux-devtools": "^2.1.0", "style-loader": "^0.12.3", "url-loader": "^0.5.6", "webpack": "^1.12.2", "webpack-dev-server": "^1.10.1" } I mean seriously! You can't just use JSX, you need a toolchain, it swiftly becomes swallow the spider to catch the fly. Then there are the missing things, the state management, something mundane like setting the document title in a *separation of concerns manner*. This is before we get to the fun of the right kind of build, have some linting, some rules around ES6.
I think people always get downvoted for niche views sadly. Downvote is about 'popularity' nothing else much. Many niche areas use libs that are almost canonical in one specific language, rather than meaning they are better. I think it will be interesting to see, C++/CLI relies so much on COM I'm not sure it will ever be popular, but it's sure nicer than JNI!
Visual Studio and C# go hand in hand. Since you are coming from Python you might be interested in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It's Atom with the Omnisharp Server built into it. It won't do most of the things that you can do in VS, but if you are just looking to learn and want a lightweight editor, it's good.
That might change in a few years. If Microsoft continues down their open source route, I could see a lot of shops making their code VNext compatible which will allow development on all platforms. There is definitely a financial incentive for a company who likes C# to move to Linux.
You can learn c# literally fully from the internet. Many resources go search it up
As a professional .NET dev by day, and Linux hobbyist by night, I can't wait to see where VNext is in a year or two. It's truly an exciting time to be a .NET guy.
No. No it does not.
Don't forget that the deps weigh a measely 340 MB! https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/6530
WTF? Does it come with a printer driver?
&gt; It's just not an open-source project It is these days. Microsoft is more open than google.
&gt; I think part of the problem is cultural, in that .NET users tend to wait for a canonical solution from Microsoft, rather than developing solutions themselves. I think this has changed a lot since nuget. The idea of using an open source library is no longer heretical. The big question is whether it will end up being too little too late.
I will add one thing, if you happen to be a student, or still have a student email address resharper is free :)
This is terrible advice. ASPX is there for legacy support only and shouldn't be used for new projects. Same with LINQtoSql. if anyone is learning .net they should be learning the modern tools.
I guess it was a different sub after all: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3xc3cp/free_pluralsight_membership_for_6_months/ 
One I came across recently was lucene. The .net version is essentially cross compiled from the java one and it doesn't feel native. I couldn't find a better .net equivalent though. More often the projects are there, but they clearly don't have the corporate backing that their java equivalents do.
Anyone know if the flavour of C# they support is AOT or JIT compiled?
Well I avoid working at places where there is no time for reddit or facebook and if there is time for reddit and facebook I can find time for incremental improvements either by requesting it officially or by cutting the from the reddit and facebook time.
The developers are so bleeding edge with synergetic continuous agile delivery that they don't version it. Every change is committed directly to the CDN.
