Some documentation would be nice
I've worked with excel in vb before. I'll look at the libraries in the morning
I'm somewhat of a novice too, but do you need to add a semicolon to the command string?
Dollars to donuts it was WPF or WinForms.
Don't use a mac. Or use a VM which would suck. Or you can have both OS installed. Forgot what apple calls it
Avalonia is pretty close to WPF, at least at the simpler levels that I'm familiar with. But yeah, OP should get a windows environment for the course. I have a hard time believing that the prof didn't indicate that a windows machine is needed. 
The standard reasoning seems to be it clutters your entities. All the people that think that tend to use that reasoning also use anemic entities. Personally I think something like defining the max length of a property is pretty intrinsict to its definition... &amp;#x200B;
That argument doesn't make any sense to me. e.g. If your using a seperate business layer and data access layer why do we suddenly not care that a property has a maximum length of 100... The datastore isn't going anywhere, as soon as you try and save that object it's going to get pissed at you if it's length is over 100 characters.
I'll give you a hint: "multiples of four".
The company I work for uses the outlook platform. A company that we are partnering with uses a google calendar. We are trying to find a way to be able to create one calendar (via an app) that will connect with both the google calendar and outlook. 
OP, here's another option for you too. It's an open source tool that uses .Net Core which DOES run on OSX and let's you build a C# GUI using the XAML Framework - [https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia)
Rather than trying to solve the specific case of, "Player left X matches on the table," try and solve for the general case of, "This is how many matches I need to take to keep myself safe". That should have the desired effect at any number of matches.
It is good but Azure Portal is garbage and slow. And the "telemetry". Like aggregating and sampling of data when I just want the raw data is annoying
This is actually the most accurate response without giving a direct answer, since we have zero idea if there are limitations (known or not to the user) of what operations can be used. &amp;#x200B; Main question to the OP. What mathematical operators have you learned in C# thus far? If it is a school side-project, then that's one thing. If it is an exercise and you have not gotten through some of the other operators besides "BEDMAS" then you might not be able to use the one we are referring to.
I wrote a class a while ago to pull a student list out of a spreadsheet, split it up and all kinds of stuff... It uses OleDbConnection (using System.Data.OleDb;) Here is the OpenConnection() function. Basically, you pass it a string path to an xslx file and it will return an OleDbConnection so you can access the actual sheets themselves: private OleDbConnection OpenConnection(string file) { OleDbConnection oledbConn = null; try { if (Path.GetExtension(file) == ".xls") oledbConn = new OleDbConnection("Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0; Data Source=" + file + "; Extended Properties= \"Excel 8.0;HDR=Yes;IMEX=2\""); else if (Path.GetExtension(file) == ".xlsx") oledbConn = new OleDbConnection(@"Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0; Data Source=" + file + "; Extended Properties='Excel 12.0;HDR=YES;IMEX=1;';"); oledbConn.Open(); } catch (Exception ex) { //Error Console.WriteLine(ex.Message); } return oledbConn; } I don't remember where I read up on this, but I'm sure it was SO at one point. But this was the easiest way to 'open the file'. From there I examined the data structure and figured out what areas I needed to access by indexes to what I wanted. &amp;#x200B; In your case, you would want to examine it until you reach the array that contains the sheets themselves, then load that sheet to some CSV parse/output function.
You are trying to use postgres 2.2 with .net core 2.1. Either switch to .net core 2.0 or use postgres 2.1
I'm not sure what is a good answer but BEDMAS is pretty basic in operators even outside of C#. These last 3 weeks we have learned about the different loops and how to use methods. We didn't learn about the public/private/protected yet. We did not learn about arrays yet either even though I already see some uses I could do with them. I would say the operators I know is almost all in my short code in my OP. Such as &amp;&amp; || &lt;= &gt;= != and few others. We only do basic stuffs like games or math solving situations, for loop to print a triangle, etc.
Not sure why you’re getting downvoted for staying within the requirement of your project. Silly people.
You would do a sort of analysist after before each turn even if you have 50 matches left? Imo it doesn't matter how many you pick until you get close to 7 so you don't get blocked by the computer. (10 matches, take 3, computer takes 3, 4 left = I lose.)
Good news, but I found GitLab for myself a couple month ago :)
Try to specify the version of Postgres provider or change the core package of ASP.NET Core to the supported version. Probably it's called like Aspnet.core.all
&gt; For a prng to spit out truly random numbers What?
I will try this and get back to you. So npgsql versions in sync with ef core?
Well i am not a developer for npgsql, i am just reading the errors you posted :)
Process proc = Process.GetProcessById(pid); proc.Kill();
Thank you for finally giving up on derailing my derailing my question. Imagine someone getting frustrated that their question is getting polluted by impertinent misinformation. Also no one cares if a dev laughs at them. ✌️
So I guess you think OP should post a second question, asking how to get the pid of the currently selected application?
Maybe [this SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46176798/get-current-active-application-name-in-windows-10-using-c-sharp) will help.
You can pretty easily execute autohotkey scripts from your dotnet app. AHK has all the functionality you need to send close command to currently focused window. 
I think if he don't specify his question and can't look MSDN about this method, which contains a user-friendly example with new (for him maybe) method GetProcessByName("Notepad.exe");, he don't even deserve an answer 'cause he don't even try to google it first.
I would recommend not using Microsoft.AspNetCore.App. If you look at the dependency list, you'll see that it pulls in everything under the sun. https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App/2.2.1 You don't need all of that. For example, no one needs 8 different ways to store their configuration files. I don't know why this even exists. 
Did you just not *read* this part of his question? How to close **the currently selected application** from another C# program. I may be wrong, it's happened before -- but I believe the hard part is identifying the currently-selected application.
&gt; he don't even deserve an answer 'cause he don't even try to google it first. I'm not saying you're a dick because I'm polite.
I can select everything on this planet. If he trying to say "I need to close application/window which currently active", then it's a different question. Poor questions = poor answers. Btw, he still can google few several questions - How to use Win API? - How to enumerate windows via Win API? or How to get active window via Win API? - How to get PID of process via Win API using his window? All the questions can be found easily on stackoverflow via google.
 This is posted in C# because?... it's mentioned you should learn it, that's literally it.
They're probably referring to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_randomness
&gt; All the questions can be found easily on stackoverflow via google. Let this suffice as your answer to all future posts on this sub so the rest of us don't waste our time and/or get irritated to death. **THANK-YOU**
I didn't explicitly use this dependency. It came when I dotnet new'd a webapi project. What should I change it to?
Am I missing something? I do not see the connectionString defined in this code. Definitely should put in try ... Catch to see if something is happening with the code. 
No. The only reason to use Xamarin is because it’s cross platform. 
That's a really good question that I'm trying to figure the answer out to myself. Currently I'm using that ridiculous package and there's no way in hell that I'm going to be using Facebook, Google, or Twitter for authentication. But they're all in there.
P.S. Here is the list of things that they are planning on removing from that package in the next version: https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/3755 
A question: with "information" you mean meta information about the classes? Or are you also talking about attributes?
This question is almost 20 years old and has been explained in many variations for EVERYONE. I don't create a ticket on github or somewhere else with "I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THING" or "HOLY SHIT, I'M FUCKED UP WITH" until I tried to search another ticket/issue/thread/docs literature about this problem. I don't know. You're really mad 'cause the 4th rule of this subreddit carefully explain what i'm talking about. Poor questions equals poor answers. If you're missing some term and using some synonym without explanation what do you want then get ready to get a "synonym"-like answer. I don't want to ask OP how he is selecting the application or something else, because I've got work to do and I'm not an extrasensory for him
Found your answer. Looks like for a basic REST server you just need Microsoft.AspNetCore, Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy, and Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc. Here's my complete dependency list: &lt;ItemGroup&gt; &lt;!--&lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.App" /&gt;--&gt; &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore" Version="2.2.0" /&gt; &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy" Version="2.2.0" /&gt; &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc" Version="2.2.0" /&gt; &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Razor.Design" Version="2.2.0" PrivateAssets="All" /&gt; &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.FxCopAnalyzers" Version="2.6.2"&gt; &lt;PrivateAssets&gt;all&lt;/PrivateAssets&gt; &lt;IncludeAssets&gt;runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers&lt;/IncludeAssets&gt; &lt;/PackageReference&gt; &lt;PackageReference Include="Swashbuckle.AspNetCore" Version="4.0.1" /&gt; &lt;PackageReference Include="Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Swagger" Version="4.0.1" /&gt; &lt;/ItemGroup&gt; 
By information I mean stuff that you might store in a file or database, stuff that a user either enters or sees. 
There are swathes of learning opportunities for free on the Internet which will get you going. Whilst I appreciate a good book and I have a few c# ones that are a few years old. I tend to read a bit if them and then they gather dust on a shelf. The best way to learn is to write code, make mistakes, debug and ask questions. 
Yeah you could usually find what you needed, it was just the organization made navigation stupid hard. 
Thank you so much for your effort. I will try this in a few hours after I am home and confirm.
Application.Idle: "Occurs when the application finishes processing and is about to enter the idle state." basically the event handler will be called once each time the main loop runs out of messages to process. A Menu is a separate Window; so while the mouse is over it, that Window receives messages, but your window does not. it stays idle- But remember it only get's a message once each time it becomes idle. That means it doesn't get more messages and doesn't fire your event. And you have problems when moving the window because it is constantly receiving WM_MOVE messages while you move it, so the message queue doesn't empty and your idle event is never called. In fact, this appears to be "called out" on a [Stack Overflow thread](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/67651/what-is-the-standard-c-windows-forms-game-loop#) where (I suspect) you may have found this: &gt;When using Application.Idle or PeekMessage, because you’re only doing work when Idle, your game or application will not run when moving or resizing your window, without code smells. For Game Loops in C# I've always used a separate thread that runs continuously while the game is running (and gets suspended for example if it loses focus, etc.). It tries to run the game as fast as it can and then initiates any rendering or painting at the end of each "frame". 
Thanks! And yea, that's exactly where I got it. I'll dive into threading then.
C# 7.0 in a Nutshell: The Definitive Reference
My pleasure. As I said, it's been something I've meaning to address my own projects as well. 
One of my collegue did something similar, but applied a rather different approach. He created few base classes and he setting up the mocks and what not with reflection and expression trees. Every test class inherits from one of the base test class. I like that approach better over generating code as you can be more flexibile. For example, one time we decided to introduce automatic tests for checking Dispose() calls, it was a matter of few lines and it was rolled out for all the tested classes.
I use this library: &gt; https://github.com/ClosedXML/ClosedXML ...for building and writing Excel files in my SEO Macroscope application. I *think* it can be used to open and work with existing files too; although I have not actually used it to do that myself. 
The one you got, while not the best regarded one, will propably work fine. Remember to lot just read, but start coding directly! If you want another book I would recommend either C# 7 in a nutshell or Essential C# 7.
It's like 5 emojis. I think, that emojis (and shields) are making that poor, boring document a little more interesting and colourful. Don't be such a buzzkill. Cheer up!
Okay, I'll do some digging and try to implement real ECS into Termgine!
I look up to that lib. But it's look like it's made specifically for rouge-like games :) 
Thanks bro, but i heard it's not good for beginner
Thanks bro for your advise, but i don't know anything, i think a good book can showing my way to learn, after that i can write code, make mistakes, debug and ask questions. &amp;#x200B;
Thanks bro, but C# 7 in a nutshell is good for beginner? I'm absolutely beginner 
Surprised no one said [qml.net](https://github.com/pauldotknopf/Qml.Net) 
If you are completely new to programming of any kind, most c# books are a bit too heavy. You should check out Head first Learning to Code. It uses Python but focus more on the core concepts of programming. I would recommend Head First C#, but it is a bit older and not quite as well regarded. But if you really want to start with C# give it a look. 
The most obvious answer, everyone else is doing the usual "over engineering". 
At the very least, if you don't go full on multithreaded, simply invalidating in the paint handler might work to keep it going. Or just use a timer.
As others have mentioned this is probably not what you want. To use a type (in the normal, reflection-less way) you have to know it at compile time. For an object pool like this, the object pool itself doesn't really care what's in it, as it won't be using the objects itself, merely providing them to someone else. I'd say make the object pool take just *object*, you can still key it on the type. Then whatever code you have to retrieve an object from the pool can still be generic and simply cast the stored object to T. I don't think generics adds any value here. If the object pool actually need to interact with the objects, give them a common base class or an interface and use that type instead of *object*.
oh no oh god no
You can expand paths with environment variables using Environment.
Could you give me an example?
Use Environment.GetFolderPath(...) and Path.Combine(...). It's been ages since I used it so the name might be a bit different, but you should look for something like this.
Possible duplicate of https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38075381/get-documents-folder-path-of-current-logged-on-user Seriously though, this is a better way than I was thinking because it will work for all language versions of Windows. 
There is a version convention, If you are using for ex. dotnet core 2.2, your dependencies have to be on the exact same version as your framework. You can change them manually in the .csproj file and get them all on the same level and then restore them.
Yes obviously, but which?
It's not a book, but I very highly recommend watching this series: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAC325451207E3105](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAC325451207E3105) It's great for beginners.
How about some Win32 Interop? using `GetForegroundWindow` combined with `GetWindowThreadProcessId` should give you exactly what you want using System.Runtime.InteropServices; [DllImport("user32.dll", CharSet = CharSet.Auto, SetLastError = true)] static extern IntPtr GetForegroundWindow(); [DllImport("user32.dll", CharSet = CharSet.Auto, SetLastError = true)] static extern int GetWindowThreadProcessId(IntPtr hWnd, out int lpdwProcessId); public static void Main() { var fg = GetForegroundWindow(); var threadId = GetWindowThreadProcessId(fg, out int processId); var process = System.Diagnostics.Process.GetProcessById(processId); process.Kill(); } &amp;#x200B;
I would, because it's actually the simpler problem to solve. There is no particular difference between solving the problem at 1-7 matches and solving it at 500 matches. After the problem is solved you simply keep busy until 0.
Thsnks bro, i will check it
Thanks bro for your advice :) my goal is i want to be C# full-stack web developer, i explained my goal and everything in my new post(if you don't mind check it): [https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/ae6a4s/ways\_advises\_and\_approaches\_for\_learning\_c\_web/](https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/ae6a4s/ways_advises_and_approaches_for_learning_c_web/)
Oh don't make XAML sound daunting to a mewcomer, it's just HTML meets XML and you can manipulate it from code just like you would WinForms except it's all more powerful and modern
Yeah, and they clearly meant "all the questions above", no need to be so salty. By not showing at least some charity you just sign under being as much an ass as they are.
It's possible to get "random" numbers but still within a specific pattern. (Eg: Every 10th number is always above 1000 for example). Thus the [TestU01](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TestU01) tests for "true" randomness. The "pseudo" of "PRNG" only means that the randomness can be "predicted" by using the same seed each time. It doesn't mean that it's not random. It's possible to get "random" numbers that are like this: 55, 103, 12, 308, 14, 999, 68, 227, 87, 142, 35, 789 So while those are "random" they're not "truly random" since the clear pattern is a two digit number followed by a three digit number. However, even a pseudo-random number generator can give "truly" random results, predictable only by which seed was used to start up the generator.
Hi, it seem to find the path, but no file is appearing. The filestream should create a text file as normally, as I hardcoded another path and it worked fine, before I changed to documents folder.
Try this: var userDocsPath = Environment.GetFolderPath(SpecialFolder.MyDocuments); var filePath = Path.Combine(userDocsPath, @"some\path\to\file.txt"); using (var fileStream = File.Open(filePath, FileMode.OpenOrCreate)) { //do stuff with the FileStream object } Change the path, `FileMode`, etc. to suit your needs. Hope this helps.
Or, now that they have been given a potential solution, they could do some research on their own 
As always: C# in Depth, vol 4. P.S. Could we do something with such posts? Every few weeks question like that pop ups and answers are pretty similar. It can be easily found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/search?q=book&amp;restrict_sr=on 
It is important that you **understand** the error message, instead of blindly trying to add packages. &gt; error NU1107: Version conflict detected for Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore. Install/reference Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore 2.2.0 directly to project APIProject to resolve this issue. This error means you have version conflict for the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` package. That means the same package is referenced twice in different versions. &gt; error NU1107: APIProject -&gt; Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL 2.2.0 -&gt; Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore (&gt;= 2.2.0) This line tells you more about the conflict. You have the package `Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL` installed in version `2.2.0`. This package has a dependency to `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` with the version constraint `&gt;= 2.2.0`. That means the version of `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` must be at least `2.2.0` or newer. &gt; error NU1107: APIProject -&gt; Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.1 -&gt; Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore (&gt;= 2.1.1 &amp;&amp; &lt; 2.2.0). This is the remaining part about the conflict. You have the package `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` in version `2.1.1` installed. That package has a dependency to `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` with the version constraint `&gt;= 2.1.1 &amp;&amp; &lt; 2.2.0`. That means `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` must be version `2.1.1` or newer, and must be smaller than `2.2.0`. This is the conflict. One package depends on version `2.2.0` or later, the other package says the version must be smaller than `2.2.0`. You can't fulfill both wishes. The solution is often to either downgrade `Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL` to an earlier version, which also depends on an earlier version of `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`. Or alternative upgrade `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` to a newer version which can work with the newer version of `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`.
At least definitely don’t go for C. If your target is to do modern development and especially on .NET you would waste countless hours learning C. I’m not saying it wouldn’t be useful to know the things you would learn there, but the thing is a lot of them don’t transfer to OOP or memory management the .NET way. As for how to get to it, I can’t really recommend any specific courses or tutorials since I haven’t done any. Do make sure whatever you choose they are using modern versions. So definitely ASP.NET Core would be a great way to go since it’s the newest and greatest. It contains both an MVC way of doing things as well “the old way”, handles single-page apps well and whatnot. If you can’t find anything suitable for that then at least ASP.NET MVC 5 level things. Anything older might not be good since you’d need to learn the new stuff anyway. It’s not like you can’t use older ones, but it’s better to go for the newest anyway. Also do learn Entity Framework (Core) while at it. I’m sure proper ASP.NET Core courses will use it so shouldn’t be a problem. 
&gt; i want to learn Full-stack web development with Asp.net core and C#, but i don't know where to start. You are trying to do too much at once and picking absolutely random things to learn. First lean the basics of programming, that will likely take up the full 9 months if you are very dedicated. The CS50 course is pretty good advice. Programming is programming, C is not too far from C# and it is a good language to learn as it is fundamental for very much of our computing world (operating system kernels, databases, network stacks, drivers, etc) But you could also take any given programming intro course, in C# or whatever other language. Once you have a grasp on the basics you could move one more step towards "full stack webdev" if that is what you want to do. Such as learning the basics of SQL, or learning the basics of HTML and CSS. 
The amount and the kind of questions you ask here is... astonishing.
Thanks bro, sorry about that :( i think this group should have a good wiki for beginners
So... I still cannot figure out, what is the difference between Unity components and normal ECS. I found [that](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/docs/introduction/entity-component-system.md) nice example of ECS, but still... From my point of view Unity components (like Rigidbody, Colliders) are components and empty gameobject is entity. Correct me if, I'm wrong.
&gt; filePath public class test { private string comment; private string title; private string path = Path.Combine(userDocsPath, @"some\path\to\MyFile.txt"); } Can I make a public class variable like this, and use the path in many different function in the class? 
I've done something like this in the past. I don't know if this will help you, but here is a very abstract version similar to what I've done: using System; using System.Collections.Generic; class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { var providers = new ProviderContainer(); providers.AddProvider(new SimpleProvider&lt;FooBar&gt;()); if (providers.TryCreate(out FooBar result)) { Console.WriteLine(result.ID); } Console.ReadKey(true); } } public interface IProvider&lt;T&gt; where T : class //the constraint isn't important, but I prefer to be able to return null as opposed to default(T) (shown later) { T Create(); } public class ProviderContainer { private Dictionary&lt;Type, object&gt; Providers { get; } = new Dictionary&lt;Type, object&gt;(); public ProviderContainer() { } public void AddProvider&lt;T&gt;(IProvider&lt;T&gt; provider) where T : class { Providers.Add(typeof(T), provider); } public bool TryCreate&lt;T&gt;(out T result) where T : class { var targetType = typeof(T); if (Providers.ContainsKey(targetType)) { var provider = (IProvider&lt;T&gt;)Providers[targetType]; result = provider.Create(); return true; } else { result = null; //without the 'where T : class' constraint, I'd have to use default(T) here, and when I do something like this, I prefer to work with reference types and not value types. return false; } } } public sealed class SimpleProvider&lt;T&gt; : IProvider&lt;T&gt; where T : class, new() { public SimpleProvider() { } public T Create() { return Activator.CreateInstance&lt;T&gt;(); } } public class FooBar { public string ID { get; } = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(); public FooBar() { } } Let me know if you need me to explain this to you. I hope this helps and doesn't serve to confuse you.
I am not really experienced with interop, but you could look [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-windowfrompoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-windowfrompoint), [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getcursorpos](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getcursorpos) and [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-closewindow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-closewindow). I know you can mangle them together, I am just not sure how :)
&gt;that will likely take up the full 9 months if you are very dedicated Really? I have very good experience in Linux and windows, and i have general information about IT, and using computer since i was 6, im hardworking and i can study C# 11 hours a day , 9 month cant make me a full stuck web developer? if it can't, next year i have a project, i really have to go another stack, like MERN stack because it's very easy. but i choose C# because i really like desktop application development. is really it take that too much? how long does it take to be Full-stack web developer with C#? Thanks bro for answering :) 
That's my experience butting my head against the wall. Debugging is insanely difficult and many errors silent. WinForms on the other hand is less flexible - granted - but much easier to grasp. I'm primarily a web dev, so by no means an expert in either WinForms or WPF, but my limited experience with WPF and XAML had been bad and not something I'd want for newcomers. 
Thanks very much bro, i have another question if you don't mind how long does it take to be Full-stack web developer with C#? I have very good experience in Linux and windows, and i have general information about IT, and using computer since i was 6, im hardworking and i can study C# 11 hours a day , in 9 month i can be Full-stack web developer? &amp;#x200B;
Being able to code a web site is one thing ! Doing it properly is another. It takes time to learn, don't try to rush it. I think that instead of aiming to become a full-stack dev, you should focus on a specific subject. And please don't do 11 hours a day, or it will become a chore and bad programmers are the one that don't like what they do !
You did add a filename to the folder, right?
&gt; , C is not too far from C# and it is a good language to learn as it is fundamental for very much of our computing world We're talking about a beginner here. Look at it any way you want, but C# is much easier to understand than C for anyone who is new to programming.
It worked... Is it possible to add like a folder to the path? and if the folder doesn't exist, it automatically creates it and puts the txt file inside it?
when i say learn, i mean make a simple website, there's other stacks like MERN stack in [FreeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.org/) can be full stuck web developer in 1800 hours, i have some friends do that in 3 months and now they make websites, got jobs, but i don't like it, i really like C#, and i like to do desktop programming in future. idon't know, if i cant be full stuck web developer in 9 month with c#, i should go for another stack like MERN which i dont like it.
var folder = Path.Combine(myDocumentsFolder, "testfolder"); Directory.CreateDirectory(folder);
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1240373/how-do-i-get-the-current-username-in-net-using-c
&gt;how long does it take to be Full-stack web developer with C#? If you study full time and you find that learning the all parts of the stack is easy then you might be able to become a full stack developer in 9 months. But then you will be that at a junior developer level. Learning to develop software - regardless of the type of stack you choose - will take a long time. It takes many years of practice to become a senior level developer. Your choice between [asp.net](https://asp.net) core or MERN does not change the fact that you will end up being at most a junior level developer after 9 months. &amp;#x200B;
Next to reading books about c# development you should also start listening to some podcasts. There are two I can recommend: dotnetrocks and codingblocks. These podcasts will help you understand the mindset of a good software developer. Writing code is just one of the things you will need to learn and these two podcasts will help you understand what software development is all about.
use some boolean to verify if the file/Directory exists then create the directory and create the file Directory.CreateDirectory(stringDirectoryRoute);
Thanks bro you give me a hope
this podcasts may also improve my Englsih listening, thanks bro
from the documentation (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.array.sort?view=netframework-4.7.2) &gt; This method uses the introspective sort (introsort) algorithm as follows: &gt; * If the partition size is fewer than 16 elements, it uses an insertion sort algorithm. &gt; * If the number of partitions exceeds 2 * LogN, where N is the range of the input array, it uses a Heapsort algorithm. &gt; * Otherwise, it uses a Quicksort algorithm. &gt; This implementation performs an unstable sort; that is, if two elements are equal, their order might not be preserved. In contrast, a stable sort preserves the order of elements that are equal. &gt; For arrays that are sorted by using the Heapsort and Quicksort algorithms, in the worst case, this method is an O(n log n) operation, where n is length.
sounds like it is just fine to use Array.Sort instead implementing Merge Sort
Yes, but a few things: * Use PascalCase for class names i.e `Test` not `test` * In 99.9% of all cases, use public *properties* instead of public fields -- **keep fields private** *unless* you have a **valid** reason to expose a public field. Note: Properties use PascalCase, fields use camelCase (by convention). Also note you can use auto-property syntax so you don't have to declare a private backing field as well as implementing the property's getter and setter. * Consider passing in the values of path, title and comment either via the constructor (if you wish to store the values in the class) or pass them into the method that actually writes to the file instead of storing them in such a class (I don't know what you are attempting to model with your `Test` class, so I am not sure you actually need to store these values in the same class that does the writing or if the class is supposed to model a simple data-transfer object (aka DTO).
C is a much smaller language spec. 
I don’t think this is good advice. The packages in this metapackage are already included in the shared framework. There’s neither runtime nor deployment cost to using the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` metapackage. Microsoft explains how and why to use it [here][]. [here]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/metapackage-app?view=aspnetcore-2.1 
A lot of people feel like today that the "Full Stack" is so complex that nobody can really be a full stack web developer anymore. but it really depends on the scale and complexity of what you are trying to do. What is your project? If you are trying to get a large scale production service, database driven, on to the web, that has solid uptime, performance, fairly complex html and css design, can handle large loads and be secure, then yeah, 9 months isn't enough probably
Technically the worst case is O(n\^2) for quicksort, but more the most part, it should be closer to O(n log n).
worst case big-O of QuickSort is n^2 You may have meant that the .NET tactic of using heapsort when the partition threshold is exceeded avoids that, it just wasn't clear. 
It's not slow for me, but to each their own. Also, I get the raw data just fine. It does aggregate it for you but you can drill down into each individual issue.
Thanks bro, my goal project not that large, just a simple learning website with paid subscription, i must do it in next year. 
I just copy/pasted the text. 
if it uses heapsort it would be ok, but it seems that quicksort has worst case scenario than Merge sort
&gt; no need to be so salty Good advice.
That might be true, but again I was saying C# is easier to understand for a beginner. I'm not sure what this has to do with C having a smaller spec. You don't need to know all the specs of a language to start programming in it.
Beautiful solution. 
&gt; thus closer to the English language C#: namespace foo { class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { int x = 5; x = x + 2; System.Console.WriteLine(x); } } } C: #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; int main() { int x = 5; }
Throw the update statement into a stored proc. Call the stored proc in C# via a CommandType.StoredProcedure and add all relevant params. Best practice to never hand build queries via strings in C# to more easily avoid SQL injection.
Generally a binary tree will be much slower on modern computers due to lack of memory locality. Like even if you want to use a tree for O(log(n)) lookups it can be better to use a sorted array with a binary search instead. 
Worked with forms for 2 years and the platform specific packages for another 2. I'd suggest if you're doing lots of platform specific views and visual elements to stay away from forms. Personally, I usually prefer to write the UI twice on each platform in Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS. Simply making a custom loading spinner took a lot of creative code in forms. You do get very good performance using either if used properly.
I know, but visual studio is kinda demanding, running it in a virtual machine makes it even slower. Sure it's a... solution, just not one I would work with.
If we're going to be using 'my first day of programming' examples then every language besides maybe assembly will be easy to read.
I work with Xamarin.Forms 2 years and its very cool. On Mac you can use the Ios designer and code design with xml. Its very easy to learn all this. 
I was trying to not be lazy and make a "good loop" but honestly I'm doing so little drawing on this project I might just use a timer.
Much better, in fact. Merge sort is really mostly useful when you can’t fit the data in memory at once. 
I *hated* my experience with xamarin. ~20 years of experience, xamarin was the low point.
Introsort uses quicksort when there are more than 16 elements, insertion sort otherwise. Also, if the recursion dearth exceeds twice log n, it uses heapsort (guaranteed n log n, like mergesort, but faster in practice) instead. 
You are talking about xamarin as a whole or just xamarin forms?
so what data type should I use for allocating something like Huffman algorithm
What is the error you are getting ?
I wonder if you were to use some sorting algorithm for huffman algorithm what would be the best time complexity? Also I found that some data structure refers as Binary tree as more efficient than an array
&gt; Also I found that some data structure refers as Binary tree as more efficient than an array Yeah but there are two ways to analyze time complexity. The traditional way considers an “operation” (like comparing two elements) as a primitive concept that takes a fixed amount of time. This doesn’t describe the real world very well, though, due to the very indirect memory hierarchies of modern computers. Arrays often win out in practice due to this. 
"The issue is that the .dlls for the cache API are wrappers around C++ unmanaged code, and so i can’t add them to an ASP.NET project" Because you can't, or because it seems like a bad idea?
For the if statement or the code I found?
I have no idea I'm not familiar with the details of implementing the Huffman algorithm. 
Pretty fancy! But yeah, if one is doing "graphics" with winforms/gdi+ I suspect a timer would do just fine!
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit: - [/r/dotnet] [Implementing Java ReferenceQueue and PhantomReference in C#](https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/ae8dmf/implementing_java_referencequeue_and/) &amp;nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
The shared framework is also version-locked, which causes warnings (or worse) when you update a package to a newer version. Remember, this post was made because the shared framework was causing him problems.
At this point, I do not have any idea if whatever I want to do is platform specific or not. Videos, Images, Gifs, Vertical/ Horizontal feeds, Graphs, Charts , Browser, and a few labels, all at one place on a TV changing every few seconds. Will Xamarin Forms be able to run these without breaking a sweat? Performance is important here. Sacrificing iOS is acceptable if sticking to native ensure better performance.
What is the error message you receive when it crashes while debugging the application?
I'm not an optimization guru, but since _splitMixSeed is only changed prior to the first call to SplitMix64(), you could trim a bit of time off as such: public ulong Seed { get =&gt; _seed; set { _seed = value; _splitMixSeed = _seed; _seedBytes[0] = SplitMix64(); _seedBytes[1] = _seedBytes[0]; _seedBytes[2] = _seedBytes[0]; _seedBytes[3] = _seedBytes[0]; } } 
Not entirely sure on all the details but you could author an MSBuild .proj file that orchestrates this for you. Another option is perhaps breaking your solution into different parts and making your dependant assemblies into NuGet packages and publish those. Hopefully, they don't change that often. I can't think a way to solve you probelm without some hacky extra steps, nothing sounds entirely great.
Well, with the IF statement I get this Title: Exception Unhandled Body: System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException: ''minValue' cannot be greater than maxValue. Parameter name: minValue' &amp;#x200B; I suppose I could do that and list them individually but shouldn't it be possible to do it through if or switch statement on this class to keep the code down and what not?.. 
Is there a bare bones prototype you can build for each UI solution that will tell you the answer?
Look into T4 templates
If it was a bad idea I’d be all for it, but it’s not working properly 
I think they are measuring the performance of the XorShift method, not the performance to convert that output to a long, int, double with the Next\* methods. These methods have their own overhead because of the floating point operations. I copied the code and ran it on .net core with benchmark .net. This is the benchmark code: namespace MyBenchmarks { public class RandomGeneratorBenchmark { private readonly RandomNumberGenerator prng1 = new RandomNumberGenerator(); private readonly RandomNumberGeneratorOrg prng2 = new RandomNumberGeneratorOrg(); [Benchmark] public ulong GetRandomValueOriginal() =&gt; this.prng2.XorShift(); [Benchmark] public ulong GetRandomValueImproved() =&gt; this.prng1.XorShift(); } public class Program { public static void Main(string[] args) { var summary = BenchmarkRunner.Run&lt;RandomGeneratorBenchmark&gt;(); } } } These are my results on my 3 year old surface pro. I bet it runs better on a desktop cpu. BenchmarkDotNet=v0.11.3, OS=Windows 10.0.17763.253 (1809/October2018Update/Redstone5) Intel Core i7-6650U CPU 2.20GHz (Skylake), 1 CPU, 4 logical and 2 physical cores .NET Core SDK=2.2.101 [Host] : .NET Core 2.2.0 (CoreCLR 4.6.27110.04, CoreFX 4.6.27110.04), 64bit RyuJIT DefaultJob : .NET Core 2.2.0 (CoreCLR 4.6.27110.04, CoreFX 4.6.27110.04), 64bit RyuJIT Method | Mean | Error | StdDev | ----------------------- |---------:|----------:|----------:| GetRandomValueOriginal | 4.330 ns | 0.0237 ns | 0.0185 ns | GetRandomValueImproved | 1.758 ns | 0.0627 ns | 0.0587 ns | For the improved version I did this: private ulong _seedBytes0; private ulong _seedBytes1; private ulong _seedBytes2; private ulong _seedBytes3; public ulong XorShift() { var x = this._seedBytes1 * 5; var result = ((x &lt;&lt; 7) | (x &gt;&gt; 57)) * 9; x = this._seedBytes1 &lt;&lt; 17; this._seedBytes2 ^= this._seedBytes0; this._seedBytes3 ^= this._seedBytes1; this._seedBytes1 ^= this._seedBytes2; this._seedBytes0 ^= this._seedBytes3; this._seedBytes2 ^= x; this._seedBytes3 = (this._seedBytes3 &lt;&lt; 45) | (this._seedBytes3 &gt;&gt; 19); return result; } The seedbytes are now fields so no more array access. Also I reused the x variable. It does seem to make a difference to reuse an existing variable.
It seems like the code you have pasted has nothing to do with the actual error. It seems like you are trying to access an array's element which does not exist.
Yes, I have included a Readme.md with some info. And I will add comments to the code as well.
There is an update today with a complete solution. You should be able to build and run on your local desktop.
The benefit of offloading it into another a class *is* to keep code down/clean. It’s a core tenet of OOP. For example, instead of relying on typing “2c.png” every time you need to make that check, you can instead create a static class called Images, and a static property titled LabelOne (for instance), with an Image object created from the image’s URI, then when you need to check against it, use: If (image == Images.LabelOne) This will allow you to change the image’s URI only once in the static class, rather than changing every instance in your application. ——————— Regarding the error message, I believe it is coming from this line rather than the if statement: picboxCardOne.ImageLocation = paths[random.Next(0, images.Count - 1)]; The maxValue is less than the minValue because *paths.ToList()* is coming up with zero elements, resulting in a maxValue of -1 after subtracting from *images.Count*, less than the minValue of 0. So, you’ll need to figure why your list of image paths isn’t populating. 
Does .NET offer a stable sort? I seem to remember implementing one myself, but maybe I just overlooked something.
It's really, really, really hard to say but I'd suggest considering native. I've been on .NET since 2003, and I've been using Xamarin Forms since 2013. I've seen it come a very long way, but it still is a very "least common denominator" framework. That means it does things very well if both iOS and Android support a feature, and often it does nothing at all if one or the other doesn't. This is most apparent when you want little things like placeholder text in text controls, which when I last wanted it required me to write platform-specific code. So when you're talking about something very specific like streaming video, I'd be very nervous about recommending Xamarin Forms. I know Android can do it. I know iOS can do it. It's questionable if Xamarin has found a way to make it both possible and reasonably simple in Xamarin Forms. Performance can be another big concern. Consider that Xamarin Forms is an abstraction layer on top of native UI. Consider that whatever .NET CLR is running on the platform is effectively a VM with its own memory space inside of the OS runtime, which on Android is also a VM with its own memory space. Profiling performance problems can be a nightmare, and ultimately the only way to understand many of them is to be an expert at *both* the native platform and Xamarin. So in the end, even if Xamarin Forms works for this, you probably have to have a fairly strong knowledge of the underlying platform to do it. So starting as a native Android application is my suggestion.
UPDATE: Hey and thanks to everyone who tried to help me, but in school I realised a HUGE MISTAKE, i'm kinda embarrassed to admit my mistake but here we go. Basically I have a class that populates my SQL database with a pre-made xml file. As a result my SQL table was being overwritten. &amp;#x200B; Still, I really appreciate all the help I got, specifically help with how the SQL queries work (they really helped make other things I have in this program run faster/more efficiently) 
You must be in the same class that the guy who posted over on stack overflow with nearly this same question. Or, you ARE that guy lol
&gt; version convention Can you point me to a resource on this? I am getting results on general API versioning and such.
Really the only similarities between C and C# is some of the keywords and syntax. Beyond that, they are really completely different language environments to work in. &amp;#x200B; Learning C is fine, I just don't think it is useful to learn it before C# and Framework/Core. Likewise, being good at C# doesn't magically make you understand how to develop C programs.
&gt; _splitMixSeed is only changed prior to the first call If that's the case, it's my mistake. SplitMixSeed should be returning a new "random" each time it's called.
Nope I haven't posted anything on stack overflow. Ive got the entire program working just want to put it as a maze for optimisations sake as its a very long winded output going through each and every line on the console atm and this can be tedious for testing out the longer mazes as it takes quite a long time to go through them. Just want the output to look a bit cleaner than it is now
add on question to /u/worldpwn's question - in what capacity did you use xamarin and what was your experience level with the target platforms?
Seems you may be correct about the floating point operations. Is there any ***FAST*** way to get a ULONG into a double? Perhaps by copying some bytes/bits directly? 
It really depends on your goals. C alone is pretty complicated compared to C# for things like memory allocation and objects because it has no garbage collection and it's not really object oriented so jumping to C# from C will be a bit rough. Python is a scripting language and has dynamic typing and really is pretty alien to C# devs like me. If you want to be a .NET developer and you've never touched code in your life, the C# course is best. If you don't plan on being in the microsoft ecosystem, though, it may not be your best bet, unless you grab a .NET Core course. Java is actually the most common beginner language used these days from what I've seen, likely because it's not tied to windows and can be used for web, apps, and more. Basically, choose your path first, then choose the platform. Do you want to work on mobile apps development, web development, console and services, whatever you want your first job to be in. Some games still use C but I think they tend to have frameworks on top because C is a pain in the ass. It has a ton of advantages, but the complexity and ability to shoot off your foot is super high. A ton of companies use PHP too because LAMP stacks are a lot cheaper than Windows servers.
I don't think so. You could get the bytes and convert it directly to a double but there would be no way to prevent values of the double that represent invalid doubles (like NaN or Infinity) I also don't think this would be faster than the code you currently have. Why is the performance of the generator so important? Seems to me it's doing a great job.
What language you code depends on what you want to do in the future.. But programming is about logic, if you have it in you, once you learn a language, you will grasp the syntax of any other very quickly. &amp;#x200B; And that microsoft 'course' is just a introduction to programming compared to full course of CS50. &amp;#x200B; So do the microsoft one to start understanding programing, then do the CS50 for a more broad approach, by the end you should have a good understanding and a good base to be a programer, now decide what you want to focus on and master the languages best suited for the job you want. 
Its [built into the platform already](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/modeling/code-generation-and-t4-text-templates?view=vs-2015)
The big difference is the S in ECS, aka Systems. :) I think it confuses people because so many mistakenly say "an Entity Component System" implying there there's a singular "system of entity-components;" it's much more correct to use the term "the ECS architecture" to make it a bit more clear that it's a singular "architecture comprising entities, components, _and systems_." The Systems bit is where logic lives. In ECS, the Components are just data; preferably data-oriented POD aspects, but that's not a hard rule. The actual meat of logic that operates on Components must lives in Systems for an architecture to be ECS. Otherwise it's just component-based design, which is a great architecture on its own; it's just not ECS. :) Unity components and MonoBehaviours build tons of logic into the Components themselves. It's certainly possible not to and to use Unity components in a more ECS-like fashion (and the built-in components may be doing this under the hood), but logic-laden components are the default assumed strategy. Because of that, the underlying implementation is not necessarily as efficient as it could be. The actual Unity ECS they're building (available as preview already) very strictly _enforces_ the ECS architecture; Components _must_ be PODs (structs that only contain specific types) to work with their job-based System analogs. There are pros and cons to any architecture, and there's certainly reasons not to use a "real" ECS architecture and to use a simpler component-based model instead; that said, ECS architecture does bring a number of compelling advantages, particularly on modern hardware and when implemented in a data-oriented fashion. Namely, component updates in ECS are easy to pipeline and make cache-friendly and easy to aggressively multi-thread for today's 4-16 thread CPUs (and hypothetically far easier to distribute to heterogenous computing aka GPGPU, though I don't know of a production ECS implementation that does this today). ECS game code also tends to end up less spaghetti, which helps a lot; other component models tend to require a lot of boilerplate and perf-cost to add components so game logic tends to spread across existing components and cluttering them up with a multitude of concerns, which just makes understanding, debugging, optimizing, and otherwise maintaining the game code a complete and absolute nightmare (other component models don't _require_ that kind of spaghetti, but it's happened in every game I've ever seen or heard of, while ECS architectures are naturally resistant to certain varieties of pasta-based coding). Even ignoring performance or clarity, _testing game code_ is almost trivial in ECS architecture (there's no need for mocking in the majority of Systems, for example!) but is basically a massive pain in other component models or traditional hierarchy models. This is pretty much the big thing that sold me on ECS (I've not been a fan of it in the past and you can find a lot of old StackOverflow or Reddit posts of mine trying to steer people away from ECS; ignore younger me, I was dumb).
Is there a requirement that it be a console app?
Thanks very much bro for you answer, i really like C# and my goal is i want to be ASP.NET Core web developer, i think so the C# course is better for me. Thank you &amp;#x200B;
This seems like an odd way to do a wait rather than using either `Thread.Sleep` or `Task.Delay`
Thanks bro for your answer, i decided and i want to be ASP.net core web developer, so i think [C# Fundamentals for Absolute Beginners](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169?l=Lvld4EQIC_2706218949) is better for me
You're all going about it the wrong way. [Here's how I would do it](https://www.xkcd.com/221/)
No, its not, the CS50 will be 100 times better for you, because it teaches the core you need not the language. But like i said start with C# one, then do the CS50 (it didn't even start so you have time), then focus on mastering what you want, in this case more C#
Slightly confused, you haven't actually got any code in your IEnumerator? 
Just put a proxy server like IIS, Apache, NGinx, in front of Kestrel. THose are servers built for public traffic, Kestrel itself isn't.
No one mentioning Eto forms. You write the UI once to produce native wpf, monomac and gtk on windows, mac, Linux respectively. 
Thanks a lot, i will do it, but how much does it take? i have 9 month full time to learn [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET), do you think i can do it? when i say learn i mean to make a simple website
What exactly are you expecting from this code? What's the intended behaviour? 
Sure, you can achieve that by following a youtube video by tomorrow, but that won't make you a programmer. &amp;#x200B; The CS50 says its a 5/6 hours per week for 11 weeks so if you dedicate yourself you can finish it in less than a week depends on how dedicated you are. &amp;#x200B; After CS50 i think you will have good enough base to start mastering C#
Thats because this is Unity code and is a 'Coroutine'. To OP: Youre code is incomplete and makes no sense, it does not do anything after waiting. I think OP has not properly explained their intended functionality. Here is a formatted version of OPs code: https://hastebin.com/ohabigilih.cs
This looks suspiciously like Unity code. Are you trying to rate limit a mouse press? Why not something more like this: ``` public float timeBetweenClicks = 0.5f; private float nextClick; void Update () { if (Time.time &gt;= nextClick &amp;&amp; (Input.GetMouseButtonUp(0))) { Debug.Log("Mouse ButtonUp"); nextClick = Time.time + timeBetweenClicks; } } ```
Thanks very much bro for your advises &lt;3 
Thank you so much for the detailed analysis and suggestions. It really helped me cement my choice of framework. Do you think, it is possible to databind in a runtime generated view?
try making the name of the IEnumerator something other than WaitForSeconds
Yes, we could do that. Infact, I did make a project recently in Xamarin forms, much simpler than my current project and it turned out pretty nicely.
It does, when you use LINQ's OrderBy. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.orderby?view=netframework-4.7.2
Great post! Just a question tho... you write that the dockerfile copies the contents of your project to root/app, but I can't see any COPY statement. Did you forget to add that, or am I misunderstanding something?
Still same result :/. The code does not pass the "if (stoptime &gt;3)"
Thanks!
Just stay away from xamarin.forms and xamarin.android
Good question :) I actually removed it in the repo later but didn't remove it from this post, as through testing I found it was pointless. When you set the directory to be the volume to be used in the container it already has a handle to all of the files its watching, so there is no need to copy, as docker then maintains two copies of the same file (one on the drive, one copied in the container for the volume) instead of just using the files its already watching
Maybe by using a struct with explicit layout? [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Explicit)] struct uLongDouble { [FieldOffset(0)] public double asDouble; [FieldOffset(0)] public ulong asULong; }
We don't really have that flexibility unfortunately.
Not to be rude, but please at least tell us your problem as clearly as you can. You don't even mention what framework you are using and provided no relevant code. If you don't take your time to explain yourself clearly, don't expect anyone to be happy to help with their time either. 
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*.

I think you're not understanding. It's not about JSON vs XML, but about parsing the text directly into classes and not into Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;. You can use either XmlSerializer or Newtonsoft.Json. Both solutions are fine.
For curiosity sake, what did you need a stable sort for? I can envision a use case in my head but it seems so contrived. Kind of wondering about a real world example. 
I think it was for a UI list. If the user moves one record, you don't want the rest of the list to shuffle on them.
The docs don't seem to call kestrel experimental anymore (that was the case when it was first introduced). From the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel?view=aspnetcore-2.2) it seems to be considered ok to expose kestrel directly to the internet. But I guess it's also a question of how mission critical the availability of the system is and how likely a directed attack is.
You can guarantee quicksort will have n log n if you apply the constraint that you always pass a sorted list. Then the partition can be guaranteed to be the median by always picking the median as the partition. 
Quicksort has a worse Big O in theory, but in practice you will very rarely see an N^2 performance. Unless you are doing something that requires really squeezing every cycle out of the processor, just use the .NET sort. 
Putting your app behind a proxy is trivial in terms of both resources and skill. Also, the correct way of doing things.
Well you're using it completely wrong. IEnumerator is like a separate thread that just runs on the same as the main thread and is checked on once per frame. So when you start a coroutine, you are yielding that routine, not update. You can't yield update because you would completely lock up your whole game for 3 seconds. So all the stuff you do after calling StartCoroutine(WaitForSeconds()); needs to be inside the IEnumerator for it to work. Also, you never want to keep doing GetComponent again and again on the same instance, especially in the update thread. That's very expensive. Call it in Start once and store it in a variable.
Then you need to populate it if it is null, I guess, or handle null @Model values appropriately.
If you are really dedicated you could be fairly competent in nine months. Do not forget that you also want some easy way to show what you can do. It could be building your own application or contributing to an open source project. I would personally focus on either front end or back en to start with. That doesn't mean you can't touch the other "end", but it is better to have a bit deeper knowledge in one area.
You might be able to eek out a little more performance replacing multiplications with shifts and adds, though I'm not sure right offhand if they'd be functionally equivalent here with regards to overflow behavior. For example var x = this._seedBytes1 * 5; var result = ((x &lt;&lt; 7) | (x &gt;&gt; 57)) * 9; to var x = (this._seedBytes1 &lt;&lt; 2) + this._seedBytes1; x = ((x &lt;&lt; 7) | (x &gt;&gt; 57)); var result = (x &lt;&lt; 3) + x; You would think the compiler might make optimizations like this if it's faster, but in my experience that is not the case. Shifts in .Net have always benched faster than equivalent multiplication in my experience - though of course if the multiplication is a relatively small portion of the time spent it will be a wash. Shift and an add though you really need to benchmark for your specific code and environment. It's also definitely in this-probably-really-doesn't-matter territory, and will be overwhelmed by a long to double conversion. 
How exactly do you need the assembly as reference before compiling it? What does the required assembly do?
A junior level dev that can't handle really anything more than basic assignments too. The best way to learn is to build something that's fairly complex. Online courses and videos might teach you syntax, but until you rely start working with writing code every day for 6-8 hours a day you're not going to that great. It definitely takes a lot of time. I've been at it professionally for almost 4 years now and I don't feel I'm anywhere near senior dev level. 
Yeah, well, that's not how it works in a lot of large companies. You get something provided by another department and that is what you have. If they say "you get a .net runtime" that's what you get. There may literally be no way to install a reverse proxy depending on company policy.
Xamarin.Forms can handle the load, there are just a couple things you need to know. Currently Xamarin.Forms does not have an adequate grid collection view. This will soon change in Xamarin.Forms 4, which should release soon. For the graphs and charts, I would suggest using SkiaSharp instead of creating Custom Renderer. In terms of CustomRenderers, there is a learning curve with these, so be patient. It takes a while to really understand how to use them properly. Once you do customizing controls isn't too difficult.
Get rid of the division. Invert DBL_ULONG_MAX and multiply: private const double DBL_ULONG_MAX = 1 / ulong.MaxValue; public double NextDouble() { return XorShift() * DBL_ULONG_MAX; } 
&gt; Do you think, it is possible to databind in a runtime generated view? If we're talking Xamarin, yes, from experience. See, when we started our project, one of the first challenges we had was deciding how to interop with a native library we had to use. Our choices at the time were PCL or Xamarin's Shared Libraries. For internal reasons, Shared Libraries were chosen. But at the time, Xamarin did not support XAML in Shared Library projects, only PCLs. So I've worked on an XF project for 5+ years that didn't use XAML, which makes everything a "runtime generated view". The mechanics are still the same. Data Binding has a "Source" and a "Target". The "Target" has to be a Dependency Property, so you define that in your runtime-generated view. The "Source" just has to be a property, but if you want 2-way binding it needs to be at least an `INotifyPropertyChanged` type. There are some helpers in Xamarin but from there you create an instance of the `Binding` type to describe the path to the source property and any converters, then you use the view's `AddBinding()` method to connect that to the target property. It's a bit tedious but once you do it a couple times you'll get it. 
I tried your code replacing the multiplication with shifts but on .net core it doesn't make a difference. I get the same results. Too bad. I liked the idea. I was thinking about the double and if it would not be better to use the standard .net framework random generator for the double. So I ran it though the benchmark: &amp;#x200B; BenchmarkDotNet=v0.11.3, OS=Windows 10.0.17763.253 (1809/October2018Update/Redstone5) Intel Core i7-6650U CPU 2.20GHz (Skylake), 1 CPU, 4 logical and 2 physical cores .NET Core SDK=2.2.101 [Host] : .NET Core 2.2.0 (CoreCLR 4.6.27110.04, CoreFX 4.6.27110.04), 64bit RyuJIT DefaultJob : .NET Core 2.2.0 (CoreCLR 4.6.27110.04, CoreFX 4.6.27110.04), 64bit RyuJIT Method | Mean | Error | StdDev | ----------------------------------- |----------:|----------:|----------:| GetRandomValueOriginalDbl | 9.803 ns | 0.1631 ns | 0.1525 ns | GetRandomValueImprovedDbl | 7.678 ns | 0.0382 ns | 0.0299 ns | GetRandomValueImprovedDblFramework | 10.053 ns | 0.1149 ns | 0.1019 ns | As it turns out the version I posted above (with the fields instead of the array) outperforms the built-in random generator for doubles. The original version and the framework version are pretty close and can be considered equally performing. The results could differ when run against .Net framework 4.7.2. I did not test this.
Reinterpreting the ulong's bits as a double is not going to be useful for the OP. It's also not useful for converting the value of a ulong to a double value, as the binary representations of any given value are not similar.
[Don’t be a Junior Developer 💻🚀](https://medium.com/zerotomastery/dont-be-a-junior-developer-608c255b3056)
Considered ok since 2.1, but still not really recommended. 
Thanks very much bro for your advice
The case needs to be made to Architecture to enable this. 
&gt; I tried your code replacing the multiplication with shifts but on .net core it doesn't make a difference. I get the same results. Too bad. I liked the idea. Yeah it really depends on the context. If you ever find yourself multiplying by powers of 2 a lot in an algo, keep it in mind. Modulo is also super easy to beat for known divisors (Mersenne &amp; Shift+AND). So much so that you can use an array of Funcs or a switch to dispatch to different implementations based on the divisor and still beat `%` for common ranges of divisors (&lt;=128 e.g.)
Change your method from void Release(object obj) to void Release&lt;T&gt;(T obj) Then everywhere you’d use `obj.GetType()` you use `T` instead. 
Xamarin Native can be very finicky, and the documentation is pretty sub par. I'd suggest doing it full blown native android in Java or Kotlin. 
Using SIMD could make this a lot faster. Not sure if the System.Numerics.Vectors stuff does everything you’d need (full SIMD support is only in .NET Core 3) but it’s worth looking at. Not using an array will help you avoid bounds checking. At the very minimum, copy the array reference to a local before you index into it, since the runtime is limited in optimizing away heap accesses. Check what the x86 code looks like that the JIT is generating and if there are any obvious optimizations the JIT is missing / unable to perform.
You’re definitely correct in admonishing them to use break points—and it seems they may also need to learn to better review the stack trace, since it wouldn’t be difficult to at all to figure out which line is throwing the error. However, we can do so simply from reviewing the code pasted: the error in question is thrown by *random.Next(…)*, whose parameters are titled *minValue* and *maxValue*. See my detailed reply to OP’s comment.
 public short Next(short max) { return (short)(NextDouble() * max); } Err... no. XorShift()%max.
If that is really what you want, you can use System.BitConverter.Int64BitsToDouble.
SELECT LocationId, SUM(SaleAmount) as [Total Sales] FROM Customer WHERE CustomerId = X GROUP BY CustomerId, LocationId
I tested it and it ran super fast.
It would be a really good idea to take this course
It's pretty tight. You can also get dice with lots of sides if you need a little extra randomness :)
It's a dependency of the code generation script. Ideally, I'd have access to a folder (like bin or obj) where all the project dependent assemblies are there (project references, nuget references, etc). Everything you get in the bin when compilation is done, except the actual project assembly itself.

Wow! Thanks for such a broad explanation. I'll at least try to implement ECS to my project. Time to do some whiteboard planning :)
I'm with you there, although I last used Xamarin.Android about 2 years ago. I'm going to start up again on it soon, so I hope they've at least worked out those XML kinks
Yes
Im doing CS50 atm with absolutely no prior knowledge and I think its great! Really gives you a deep and fundamental understanding of programming as a whole which in turn makes it easier to grasp different concepts etc.
We have a sidebar and a sticky for a reason but I don't think many young people use sidebars/stickies anymore. It's like a thing of the forum past of the 2000s.
I don't know if you want to stick to the version you have now, but for your consideration: I found a github repository with a lot of random generators in c# code. It also has an implementation of the xorshift128 that returns a double, int or ulong. The double generator was faster with this version than with yours and the ulong generator performed similar. It also contains a benchmark project so I guess it has everything you need to make a decision on what type of generator you want to use. [https://github.com/pomma89/Troschuetz.Random](https://github.com/pomma89/Troschuetz.Random)
It doesn't matter what language you choose, you need to learn the fundamental concepts of programming, then proceed to learning object oriented programming. Once you understand those you can learn any language you need/want.

I can only tell you that it does work because I work in an almost identical scenario every day - a solution created in 2008 that has multiple projects all with forms, all of which have a base class which is a form from a different solution. The 2017 designer works fine, even rendering read-only controls that are from the base form. The only thing I can say is that sometimes the designer dies and I find that the way to resolve it is to rebuild the solution, exit Visual Studio and restart it. This pretty much always resolves it. I'd also expand the references for the failing project and make sure they are being resolved correctly. Despite taking extreme care, I have sometimes found that having a look in the csproj, the references have somehow become absolute and therefore wrong. Look especially for a dopey hintpath. One last thing you could do is to take a copy of the base class project and a derived project, create an empty solution, reference both projects and then change to a project reference and see if that fixes it. &amp;#x200B;
I think this comment is your case, best I can tell. Need to change the CORS and set it in the app so it will cover the /Token action. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26725866/cors-on-owin-and-accessing-token-causes-access-control-allow-origin-error/32294445#32294445
Thanks, I'm actually investigating the references right now. Thing is, I got so tired of butting my head against this problem, I actually made a new test solution with 2 blank Windows Forms projects, each containing one form, and derived one from the other. I immediately had this issue, which is what convinced me that it must be a "by design" problem.
I just did exactly what you did and saw the same error. I did a rebuild solution, exited visual studio and restarted it and the error had gone away.
&gt; how about you add to the comment by answering what you feel is missing? I did that. Try Ctrl-F, "robertz"
No shit. I did it and it worked too. But only if I did rebuild. I had done a clean followed by a regular build initially. What the fuck.
That looks promising. Thanks. Will update within the next 24 hours after I’ve tried it. 
This is what I think happens. The designer does not build any dependant projects. It expects an up to date dll for them to exist where the reference is resolved to. Once the designer has given up on a form in Visual Studio, it can only be persuaded to go have another look if you exit Visual Studio. So all you should have to do for your existing projects is open the base one and rebuild it, open the derived one and rebuild it, exit the derived one, go back into it and the designer should be happy.
For spinners, on Android and iOS (through Forms), you can use Lottie. Or SkiaSharp.
I've seen some people in here suggest going "native", but in my personal view, going from [Xamarin.Android](https://Xamarin.Android) and WPF direct to Forms was one of the best decisions I've made. Maintaining even two separate UIs is a complete pain in the arse. Whenever I wanted to make a change, add a new feature, if it affected the UI, I'd know that I had to do the same thing twice. That was demoralizing, aside from slowing me down. If you use Forms, you should find that layout issues aren't a problem with iOS and Android. With WPF and macOS, expect to have layout problems, as not all of the controls work correctly there yet. In WPF I have a custom renderer for almost every control that I use. Still better than doing WPF direct for an entirely separate UI.
Still doesn't fix my issue in the original solution sadly, but I think there are some build order issues which are messing with the base class-project reference. Thanks though, at least now I know where to look.
Imo, this happens because the dev's don't push back. Don't be scared to speak up. Just because the co is big doesn't mean it's slow or immovable.
Not recommended by itself. Use iis or nginx etc to setup a reverse proxy and it's fine. Kestrel just doesnt have all the features of a web server but it's got the basics.
You da real mvp.
Oooh. I like this. 
Well yes, though it wouldn't qualify as worst case. Plus insertion sort would be O(N) on a sorted list.
It works buddy! Thank you so much. Btw , how could i refer to the component without "get.component"?
Make a variable for RigidBody2D RigidBody2D rig = GetComponent&lt;Rigidbody2D&gt;(); Then u can do whatever you want with rig.
In my opinion reaching senior level takes at least 10 years and a couple of successes but also some failures.
You could deploy with a docker container with nginx as the reverse proxy if infrastructure is an obstacle. All you'd have to do is set up the proper ports
&gt;Yeah, well, that's not how it works in a lot of large companies. You get something provided by another department and that is what you have. If they say "you get a .net runtime" that's what you get. There may literally be no way to install a reverse proxy depending on company policy. Docker solves most of these problems and is trivial to implement, unless you're faced with those who adamantly refuse to accept alternative solutions.
From my experience the modulo is relatively slow, especially when numbers get bigger. A faster approach is to use a &amp; (b-1) however this works only if b is a power of 2. 
You put forward a convincing argument... But Im still hankering for some sticky note software development methodology.

Hey, are you using Unity? Btw. It's a unfinished project without release. It's probably not a good idea to add it, but there is a way if you must.
Honestly not sure but this question was asked on stack before https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13600604/how-to-get-accurate-download-upload-speed-in-c-net
I think this is actually intended behaviour If `m_CSharpFullName` is `null`, the if block will execute and the field will be assigned to a value. If it isn't `null`, then no worries. The fact that it's a class variable - and could be assigned to be another thread - is a known short-coming of the compiler's null checking. But it's not something that could really be thoroughly checked without actually executing the program.
Yeah, it's purely a compiler feature and it only guarantees single threaded correctness. Anything else would be next to impossible, when implemented like this.
Honestly, this and the fact that .NET Core exist are the things that give me hope for Microsoft. Now we only need Visual Studio under Linux, although I know that this is very far fetched.
 int lastTotal = 0; DateTime lastTime; if (lastTotal == 0) ... `lastTotal` is a local variable within that method. Each time the event handler (your method) for the `DownloadProgressChanged` event is called a new `lastTotal` variable will be created, every time initialized with `0`. Instead of having a local variable you want a field at the class level, so the value persists between invocations of the event handler.
&gt; although I know that this is very far fetched. Is it though? We already have VS Code. Who could have imagined this 5-6 year ago? 
Faster than the floating point multiply happening in NextDouble.
Well there are XNA though it's more or less dead (probably more). Although Magicka is one of the more well known games created with it. It's a framework for .NETthat is a set of tools to create games. However i think MonoGame is a reimplementation of XNA, as the XNA framework is dead. Why not use Unity, it's a great engine
Godot is free and open source
The alternative without `ConditionalWeakTable&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;` is incredibly inefficient. The finalizable objects will be collected and finalized on every GC while the tracked objects are reachable. A small optimization is to have only a single finalizable object at a time that would check all registered references, and don't re-register it if there are no references to track. It would still be inefficient, just a bit less. This specific implementation is actually flawed. If a `PhantomReference&lt;T&gt;` is strongly reachable, its finalizer doesn't run. So, you need to make some other object be finalizable and not return or publish it.
 bytesChange / timeSpan.Milliseconds That'll give you bytes/millisecond as an integer (int/int = integer division). I don't know how often that event is triggered, but if it's too often (say &lt;200 ms) you'll most likely get unstable values. In that case, wait for a specific time, say 1 second, before you update.
I'm a Windows .NET developer, and I use Visual Studio Code for all of my .NET Core projects, and it works well for me.
Unity seems too bloated for my simple 2d games.

You could serialize the set (i.e. using BinaryFormatter) to a file, grab that file, shove it into your assembly as a resource, and then deserialize from that resource at startup. Personally I avoid the built in serialization stuff, but in this case it would probably do just fine.
Then use MonoGame.
Short answer is: There are only a few DirectX and OpenGL bindings for .NET. Most development framework use one of either SharpDX SlimDX OpenTK and SharpGL or custom bindings to an already existing engine. With that said it all comes down to feature set, toolset, framework structure and compatibility. As of today there are no official C# 3d graphics intrinsics. In my personal opinion MonoGame is great and very flexible, while Unity as an engine more than a framework is up to par with current AAA engines' toolsets. SharpDX as mentioned previously is a managed DirectX binding library. SlimDX is very similar to SharpDX and focuses in being lightweight and easy to use. Mogre is a managed wrapper for Ogre3d.
Time to jump ship, any language that doesn't support that is for sure not worth using!
Great to hear about some other approach. Something I can't figure out in your colleague's approach is how to setup the mocks to emulate certain behavior. I assume the mocks will be type `object` in some collection. Then do you use some invoke methods from Moq to tell it which object to setup? I understand the gain you mentioned when you could check Dispose calls by a couple of lines of code in the base class. In what way is that related to the mock objects though? It sounds to me more like a gain you had by using a base class for test classes, isn't it?
We all have to fail along the way. No failure means no growth. 
That probably won't make a real difference, the serialization code will go through the same code path as manually adding items does.
&gt; Where it says to not use kestrel if your app is web facing. Was old advice, pre-2.1. You can use Kestrel directly as an edge server (internet facing) https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel?view=aspnetcore-2.2#when-to-use-kestrel-with-a-reverse-proxy &gt; Either configuration—with or without a reverse proxy server—is a supported hosting configuration for ASP.NET Core 2.1 or later apps that receive requests from the Internet. Even though its fairly new; Kestrel is now the 13th most used edge server on the Internet: https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/web_server/all
While serializing the internal data structures of the hashset might theoretically improve performance, I don't think it's practical to do this with the built-in `HashSet&lt;T&gt;`. There is no guarantee that the implementation of `HashSet&lt;T&gt;` doesn't change between frameworks/versions, and the hash codes aren't even guaranteed to be constant between multiple executions of the same app, so recalculating hash codes and bucket placements is necessary. If you are certain that constructing the items is a significant bottleneck in your application, you *could* include your own hash set and equality comparer implementations to guarantee stability. Could even just copy the framework ones since they're MIT licensed.
visual studio is written in WPF as far as i know, and i dont see that coming to linux anytime soon (as far as i know it uses directX internally, maybe it could be done with opengl too, but i doubt microsoft will put in the resources for that).
I've only given the reference source for HashSet a quick glance, but it seems that it at least pre-allocates the correct number of buckets/slots, potentially saving some time it would otherwise have had to spent growing/copying data around. Op could also try setting the capacity initially, might also help in the same manner.
&gt;... construct the HashSet even though I would expect this to be done on compile time. Construct a HashSet at compile time? That doesn't make sense.
You should head over to r/Unity3D as it seems to be a Unity problem. However the best course is to find it at the Unity Asset Store. That way all references is completed automatically. Unity handles these things very differently than a normal C# project.
Alot of people uses it to make very simple 2D games. They have made great strides these past years to implement very good 2D features.
&gt; return (short)(NextDouble() * max); Hrm, I changed this: return (int)(NextDouble() * max); To this: return (int)(XorShift() % (ulong)max); The end result was the exact same speed.
Which constructor are you using for HashSet &lt;T&gt;? If you are just using the zero argument constructor, then you will have an (n^2) complexity. If you preallocate the size of the Hash set, you'll have an order n improvement. 
I tried this exact thing early on. The problem is that for SOME values of "double" the "NaN" and "Infinite" are determined by the setting of specific bits. I BELIEVE (though someone would know better than me) that only 53 bits are the "numeric" portion of a double. Theoretically if I could zero out the other bits in that struct it would work, but I don't know enough about the syntax and am out of my element here.
Probably all the rest that's going on. My primary complaint was that you *started* with an integer, so going via a double in not just unnecessary, but also will texture the randomness of your values. Using modulo ensures however good your core randomness is, it gets fully carried over to your integer random functions.
I'm basically trying to generate a terabyte or two of random data. Repeatedly. And while I could (should?) use C or C++, the client makes the call, not me.
I am. I just want to know what else is out there.
HashSet has a constructor, that specifies the inital capacity. Without this constructor, the internal capacity constantly increasing. This increase requires a full copy of the current storage into a larger one, and then disposing the old. If you set the inital capacity, there will be no need for this storage increasing.
Also, if memory serves, binary formatter does a good bit of reflection and is very slow for large data sets. It's possibly the worst serializer to use, with the only selling point that it is easy to implement quickly.
You're certain that's the bottleneck? Writing 1 million strings into a hashset takes a second. class Program { static Random random = new Random(); static void Main(string[] args) { var h = new HashSet&lt;string&gt;(); var sb = new StringBuilder(); var time = Measure.Method(() =&gt; { for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1_000_000; i++) { for (int j = 0; j &lt; random.Next(1, 25); j++) { int c = (char)random.Next(65, 123); sb.Append((char)c); } h.Add($"{sb.ToString()}est {i}"); sb.Clear(); } }); Console.WriteLine(time); } class Measure { public static TimeSpan Method(Action method) { var sw = Stopwatch.StartNew(); method(); sw.Stop(); return sw.Elapsed; } } } &amp;#x200B;
&gt; hard-coded static HashSet of 50,000 English words That's not huge. Not even remotely. &gt; there is a brief freeze for a couple seconds Highly doubtful that just initializing the HashSet takes "a couple of seconds." Not unless you're running this on a pocket calculator. &gt; I would expect this to be done on compile time That's impossible. The HashSet can only be initialized at run time. If you're using collection initializer syntax, the compiler turns that into a seqence of `Add` calls. If it's a static field, the compiler simply guarantees that it will be initialized prior to use. Instead of guessing, you should profile your application startup to determine what is actually consuming time.

You’d have to benchmark, but in general DataTables etc aren’t fast. At least weren’t years ago when I ditched them from a big application and immediately got a huge speed boost by using proper objects to hold the data. So that’s one thing to test.

It might, but why not just make them into properly typed objects immediately?
DataTables are from 10+ years ago. Use simple collections like List and ORM (Entity Framework, Dapper) to map a table or a query result to a list of objects.

I had to rewrite a Delphi application (phonebook) to WPF. In Delphi it used about ~1.4 MB of RAM in taskmanager while an **empty** WPF application uses about 40 MB.

You can use the SDL bindings for simple 2d games: https://github.com/flibitijibibo/SDL2-CS Or you can use opentk which is an opengl binding: https://github.com/opentk/opentk 
Check out Unity's asset store. They have a lot of 2D frameworks that will make it easier (some ridiculously so, depending on your vision). There are some worthwhile free assets, and good pay ones are usually $10 - $40 or so.
I use Veldrid and ImageSharp. ([https://github.com/mellinoe/veldrid](https://github.com/mellinoe/veldrid)) Before that I had used OpenTK ([https://opentk.net/](https://opentk.net/)) &amp;#x200B; And Prior to that I had used SFML ([https://www.sfml-dev.org/](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)) &amp;#x200B; I originally started with SFML b/c it provides the most game engine functionality directly... but then I needed to have more direct control over the graphics so I had to switch to OpenTK. Then, I wanted to switch to .net core so I had to switch to Veldrid. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
What kind of random data, bytes or something more structured?
Godot has C# bindings
Do you mean Unity2D is hard to get into, or just does way more than you need? Unity allows some awesome things to be pulled off in 2D, like lighting &amp; shaders. Plus, if performance will be an issue, Unity can kick ass in that department too.
Is this satire?
Aggressive inlining might help a very tiny bit. C# is unchecked by default though so that wouldn't make any difference.
What makes you believe this is satire? I'm actually interested in knowing what other people use (if they use them) for these topics. We tried TFS in the past, but it didn't work out.
&gt; One of their "suggestions" is to implement version control. As of right now, our process is to keep a network folder with the latest working version of projects, then copy a project to our local drives if we need to make changes. This works because there is typically only 1 person working on a project at a time. &amp;#x200B; I stopped reading after that. If I was your coworker I might strangle you to death.

I think he is being serious. Might be a sign that he needs to retire. Source control was a thing like at least 30 years ago.
Xenko is a unity competitor with some traction. But unity really dominates the C# game development space.
What do you use at your workplace? TFS? We're looking for something that's simple to integrate. - jerry
&gt; I understand the gain you mentioned when you could check Dispose calls by a couple of lines of code in the base class. In what way is that related to the mock objects though? It sounds to me more like a gain you had by using a base class for test classes, isn't it? You're right, good reasoning. There are some types, which makes unit testing more cumbersome, such as Rx.NET types, or just your custom types, which in some way behaves as factories or nest other non-trivial types. All in all, some types have to be setup the same way 90% of the times and you can save some effort if those setup logics are in the base class and automagically provided for you. If you're there for the 10% of scenarios, you can opt-out (e.g. using custom attributes on test methods) from the behaviour that the base class provides. &gt; I assume the mocks will be type `object` in some collection That's correct, the mocks are stored in a `Dictionary&lt;String, Mock&gt;`. An example test: [Test] public void ExecuteCommand_UpdateInstalled_ShowSettingsView() { Setup((ISettingsViewModel x) =&gt; x.IsUpdateInstalled).Returns(true); TestObject.Command.Execute(null); Verify&lt;ICommand&gt;(x =&gt; x.Execute(null), Times.Once); } `TestObject` and/or `TestObjectMock` something that the base class provides and you can either call some warpper methods like the ones in the example (Setup, Verify, ...), or there's a `Dep&lt;T&gt;()` method, which returns the raw mock object.

Doubles, specifically. Looking into how to go from ULong =&gt; Double quickly as that seems to actually be the slow down in this code, not the XorShift.
Interesting. Would you mind expanding on this? &gt; going via a double in not just unnecessary, but also will texture the randomness of your values
No way it has an n^2 complexity. The only way for for that to happen is if the keys are using a perfect hashing algorithm, which collections you can "add" to don't have. The HashSet already has a method for dealing with collisions, which my quick googling says C# uses the buckets backed by arrays strategy. My guess is the bottleneck is elsewhere, like other people are suggesting. OP is saying he's adding English words plus many acronyms. He didn't just say strings, and acronyms *are* English words, the only thing that makes it an acronym is a relationship to a different word. The fact that he made the distinction between the words and the acronyms, I bet he's doing some processing as he's adding them, or he's not adding strings, and the way he's doing his processing probably has some serious memory thrashing. @op, you also say "the first time this HashSet is used...", you could probably initialize it on a separate thread before you need to use it. This will make it 'feel' snappier, but your code probably still has underlying performance issues, and not addressing that doesn't help you understand *why*, which will prevent you from being able to address it in the future.
Thanks for the answer. Is the Azure version named Azure DevOps or is that a new product altogether? - jerry
Michigan, United States. Are the better products depending on country? - jerry
woah wait a second. i'm in michigan. you in metro-detroit? maybe i can come in and help you out. like as a consultant or something
yea they have changed names a couple of times. It was Visual Studio Online (VSO). Now its Azure DevOps.
We're on the other side of the mitten in Grand Rapids. Do consultant companies help with the integration or just making recommendations? - jerry
&gt; It's a netstandard2.0 library so you should be good. thanks! Every time I looked at the doc on that page I kept reading it as the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.HttpSys namespace in the Microsoft.AspNetCore.App which I'd looked up and found was .net core compatible. Thanks for spelling it out. Forced me to look at it again more carefully and find that there's the other Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.HttpSys nuget package which is, like you said, netstandard. &gt; Also, you can use kestrel, just have it behind a reverse proxy. A lot of folks in the replies to this thread are pointing out that it doesn't need a reverse proxy anymore since 2.x. Since I'd thought HttpSys was out of the question, I was just going to go with that. Now that it's back on the table I'm reassessing. One thing that's not clear, considering that the http.sys documentation mentions that: &gt; HTTP.sys is useful for deployments where There's a need to expose the server directly to the Internet without using IIS. and Kestrel documentation also mentions we can (now) use it without IIS (quote below slightly paraphrased to fit in one line): &gt; You can **use Kestrel by itself (an edge (Internet-facing) web server)** or with a reverse proxy server, such as Internet Information Services (IIS), Nginx, or Apache. What advantages are left, of one over the other? The Kestrel doc does outline the advantages of using a reverse proxy, even if you don't need support for *"sharing the same IP and port among multiple processes"* (we don't): &gt; A reverse proxy: &gt; Can limit the exposed public surface area of the apps that it hosts. &gt; Provide an additional layer of configuration and defense. &gt; Might integrate better with existing infrastructure. &gt; Simplify load balancing and secure communication (HTTPS) configuration. Only the reverse proxy server requires an X.509 certificate, and that server can communicate with your app servers on the internal network using plain HTTP. Do these four apply to Http.sys as well? or does Http.sys have anything that would make it such that any of the above four are addressed? Thanks again!
Can be both. Its whatever you would like it to be. I'm far away from Grand Rapids but I could do weekends or online after hours. Let me know
Thanks! I had a few other questions I replied to someone else with, but they were in reference to what you mentioned here so I was wondering if you had any input: https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/ae9mlo/weblistener_vs_kestrel/edpvmb3/
Could you clarify?
&gt; Kestrel just doesnt have all the features of a web server but it's got the basics. and httpsys does?
Can you serialize / deserialize big collections to disk on minimize? To me it's more just about memory management (gc, connection pooling, etc). 
I just wrap libraries that I need from c++ in c# and develop that way. I.e. glfw for window management, opengl or vulkan for graphics rendering etc. 
[check out unity tiny mode!](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2018/12/05/project-tiny-preview-package-is-here/)
I'm not really using/creating big collections. The tool just fetches some data every 3 minutes and saves them to a text file. 
How do you query "proper objects" directly from an SQL database? Is the SQLDataReader class faster than filling a datatable or is there some other way to query the database (other than EF)?
Is this from a consulting company? - jerry
How does EF do it? Does it not just use a dbdatareader or datatable to query the database?
I run an LLC where that is what I do.
That really shoudn't happen. How exactly are you running it? x86/x64? Release/Debug? What version of Windows? Did you try different frameworks (eg. 4.5, Core)? Did you try differend computers? Can you produce simpler code that exhibits this error?
I personally work in SlimDX, but it pretty much requires you to re-discover the wheel again and again. While it is fun it isn't too effective, so basically impossible to find anyone who want to work with you on a project :)
Great. I'll bring this idea to our next meeting. I'm not sure what our policies are on this. We contract out some development and also have business process consultants, but haven't done consulting for development processe before. - jerry
I wonder if the try/catch is giving you the performance issue? How often is the catch hit? You could try something like this instead: int? result = row.Field&lt;int?&gt;("OBJECT_ID");
Yes, it's like KenM but with lots of words. It would be interesting to see if people fall for it. 
After reading other comments I agree that the bottleneck most likely isn't the HashSet initialization. But according to the Microsoft docs, .Add has an N time complexity if the size of the set is equal to the capacity of the set. I think the capacity will more than double every time that happens, which would make naively adding members n log n.
No, only if you don't need specific language support or features. It's just weird. Version Control System (VCS) using skills are usually required for being hired. At least in Russia... Anyway, VCS allows you to track the whole development cycle without any local bicycles. History of changes, user management, concurrent independent development and more easy in use features. It can be any software or services you know: TFS, git, Mercurial. Just try something for free. Git for example. If you need a service or server to store your data for the whole team, try a GitHub or new GitLab with integrated "pipelines" called CI/CD. Also, you can deploy a local GitLab CE server for your company for free
HashSet add is amortized O(1). It's O(n) regardless of constructor used.. 
Any reason to not use the existing wrappers for those libraries?
Figuring out whether the code will work or not is impossible to compute, there are way too many things that can happen. What you are asking for can be reduced to halting problem, which has been proven to not be doable in reasonable time.
Not having version control = something seriously broken. As a one man shop, I still run offsite version control (and have since Visual Source Safe was a thing prior to the turn of the century). The only way that I wouldn't have a hosted version control solution is if you have daily offsite backups of whatever internal server has the VCS on it. 
It allows me to have more control of the project. I can wrap only the things that I will need as opposed to the whole library/API. It also allows me to develop whatever I'm working on the way I would like as I am choosing the design of wrapped objects. (I.e. GLFWWindow behavior in my own Window class)
That can increase when it has to expand, reallocate a new memory block, and copy the existing data.
Yes, the actual execution time may increase. However, the expanding is _amortized_, so the _asymptotic complexity_ of adding _n_ elements to a hash set is _O(n)_ :)
What exactly do you mean by mean by memory corruption?
What would be the benefit of using something like gitlab instead of just git? I'm assuming just git would let us keep our projects in the central folder they're in now. - jerry

There is no constexpr HashSet in std in C++ at the moment.
 There is no constexpr HashSet in std in C++ at the moment:)
If you need a lot of performance, it's best to use in-memory collections for performance (list, dictionary, etc). If you need to persist it, have those objects do async calls to insert/update data that happens in the collection. You may end up using thread safe collections. All of that is a bit more complicated than just using datatables / linqtosql, but if you need something that's ripping fast, it's about parallel processing, thread safe collections, and async tasks. 
How are you creating and accessing them? Are you using any locking mechanisms or thread management/pools? 
A normal PC will eat a hashset of 50k for breakfast. I have concurrent dictionary with millions of objects and the performance is awesome, just on a laptop.
This is interesting stuff! Can you share a complete runable c# project?
Instead of: private const double DBL_ULONG_MAX = ulong.MaxValue; public double NextDouble() { return XorShift() / DBL_ULONG_MAX; } use: private const double DBL_MULTIPLIER = 1.0 / (ulong.MaxValue + 1.0); public double NextDouble() { return XorShift() * DBL_ULONG_MAX; } I would remove the NextDecimal version if you don't need it. Also your integer versions are all biased towards certain values. Use these instead: public ulong Next(ulong max) { // partition entire 64 bit range into equal sized parts // discard results that would be outside of the range var scale = ulong.MaxValue / max; var truncate = max * scale; ulong result; do { result = XorShift(); } while (result &gt;= truncate); return result / scale; } public long Next(long max) { if (max &lt;= 0) throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(max), max, "value must be positive"); return (long) Next((ulong)max); } public int Next() { return (int)XorShift(); } public int Next(int max) { if (max &lt;= 0) throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(max), max, "value must be positive"); return (int) Next((ulong)max); } public short Next(short max) { if (max &lt;= 0) throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(max), max, "value must be positive"); return (short) Next((ulong)max); } public void NextBytes(byte[] buffer) { for (var i = 0; i &lt; buffer.Length; i+=8) { var next = XorShift(); for (var j = 0; j &lt; 8 &amp;&amp; i + j &lt; buffer.Length; j++) { buffer[i + j] = (byte) next; next &gt;&gt;= 8; } } }

&gt;What would be the benefit of using something like gitlab instead of just git? I'm assuming just git would let us keep our projects in the central folder they're in now. - jerry I don't know how the user management works in your company but it's something like root/central folder with user management via a website with your existing users from LDAP like Active Directory. You can easily lock some files, folders or even a version of your software (release version for example) and only chief or master of the folder (repository) can update this version after applying new changes (Merge/Pull request). Also, GitLab provides you tools for continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) processes. For example, after new uploading new changes (commits) to the folder (repository), you can configure automatically build and deploy to demo or even production servers.
Interesting. I take it it must have similar problems with arrays?
Yes
If we are talking about Turing's Halting problem, we actually know that the Halting problem is unsolvable, proven by contradiction.

The issue is that structs don't have a default constructor. Annoyingly the following gives a warning: #nullable enable using System; public class Person { private readonly Builder _value; public struct Builder { public Builder(Person p) { this = p._value; } public string FirstName { get; set; } public string LastName { get; set; } public Person Build() =&gt; new Person(this); } private Person(Builder value) { _value = value; } public string FirstName =&gt; _value.FirstName; public string LastName =&gt; _value.LastName; } (this is a pattern I use for record-like types to support a mutation syntax): var frank = new Person.Builder { FirstName = "Frank", LastName = "Smith"}.Build(); var joe = new Person.Builder(frank) { FirstName = "Joe" }.Build(); // a desugared version of // var joe = frank with { FirstName = "Joe" }; That code wants you to change the constructor for the struct to something like public Builder(Person p) { this = p._value; FirstName = FirstName; LastName = LastName; } to get rid of the warning.
&gt;I have an enormous hard-coded static HashSet of 50,000 English words plus many acronyms. Why? This could just a `List`. A HashSet will ensure uniqueness of items, so adding to it is by nature slower. And, as it's hard-coded, it might as well just be an `Array`, i.e. `string[]`. &gt; The first time this HashSet is used on run-time, there is a brief freeze for a couple seconds I'm guessing this is from something else (such as loading referened assemblies). Others have pointed out ways to optimize this, such as passing a more realistic capacity to the constructor. You also don't want to test performance in a debug build; try running with `Release`. &gt; which I assume is deferred processing to construct the HashSet even though I would expect this to be done on compile time. I'm not sure what you mean by this, and you haven't provided code, so we can only guess. Neither constructing the HashSet nor adding items to it will work at compile time. Some types have compile-time literals, but by and large, the compiler can't help you much here. &gt; This HashSet never changes. OK, but are you _initializing_ it with its items, or are you adding them after the fact? If so, how? &gt; How could I optimize this? For starters, you haven't specified why you want a HashSet in the first place, and my guess is you don't. &gt;I would like to avoid external database files in case of issues with mobile devices requiring special permissions. Reading a file _from within the sandbox_ is no problem at all in an app. Just deploy the file as part of the app.
Xamarin is getting better but it's not currently a perfect replacement for swift or kotlin (java and objective c are old school for android.) When xamarin works, it's good. When it doesn't you end up building native apps in triplicate (ios, android, and c#) That being said, yes learn c#. It's a quality language and getting better all of the time and there are a lot of companies using it (read as "lots of jobs available) But for the most part, it's not mobile app development. If you want to do mobile, then you should 'byte' the bullet and learn swift and kotlin. In the long run you will be better equipped for what lies ahead. 
I know this isn't on you, but it sounds like you're "solving" a non-issue by introducing a different issue — it may use less RAM (and even that is debatable, as this isn't _actual_ physical memory), but will certainly use more CPU and I/O instead.
Yes, MonoGame is intended to be a replacement for XNA. The rendering pipeline and the content pipeline are pretty much identical, as is most of everything else. Both have been my bread and butter for years when it comes to 2D games, but they can handle 3D pretty well too. Definitely recommended over Unity for 2D games, if anything just so that you don't _have_ to make a flat 3D game with an orthographic camera and because you have more freedom over how everything is done. Unity is better if you want asset-driven development, at least from what I reckon.
I know it's a VERY dirty hack. It doesn't actually free up any RAM at all and uses some CPU cycles. Its impact is neglible though. This is a last resort 'solution'.
As you can see in the code snippet, it is a pure function, so no locking mechanisms should be necessary. The function is being executed from C# Tasks, so it is using the TPL. 
just because it is not in the standard library does not mean it is not possible. Because it definitely is
I am seeing similar issues with arrays and 64-bit pointers from other posters with regard to the 64-bit version of 4.7.1. I have not run across a resolution thus far. Does it work correctly if you isolate it so you can run it stand alone (yet run many times in parallel) in a unit test? Have you tried 32-bit or 4.7.2 to see if it works magically? I do a lot of parallel coding myself but have not seen this, FWIW I skipped over 4.7.1 on most of my projects and went directly to 4.7.2. It was more of a timing thing for me than a conscious decision through. 
Memory ends up wrong, this manifests in different ways, as memory corruption is wont to do. What sort of detail were you looking for? Sometimes it crashes the debugger, sometimes the debugger reports that there was likely memory corruption when the program crashes, sometimes it reported an index out of bounds error when the index isn't out of bounds, and other bizarre behavior. This is with the program running with no unsafe code. 
sorry, no, it is part of a private project. you can see screenshots on my twitter though https://twitter.com/jackmott42/media
just because it is not in the standard library does not mean it is not possible. Because it definitely is
No I haven't shrank it down to a minimal reproducible standalone test just yet, but that is a good idea, also I could move up to 4.7.2 and see if it goes away. For now I'm using stackalloc which solves the problem, and makes sense to do anyway in this application. 
Could be a hardware issue. Have you tried a different machine? Could also be a [ROWHAMMER-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_hammer) effect. 
You should be using version control even if you are the only developer. Version Control Systems (VCS) aren't just about keeping back ups -- they enable multiple devs to work on a single codebase, facillitate merges and merge conflicts, keep a revision/change/audit history, enable changing an **older** version of code (for a client that refuses to/cannot update to the latest version) or maintain two separate versions of code (i.e branches). **It plays an incredibly huge part in Application Lifecycle Management (ALM)** and just software development in general. As far as what version control software to use, here are my suggestions: * Bitbucket * Github * Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) (this might have been migrated to Azure something, not sure) Whatever host you decide to use, you'll want to use **Git**. At the very least, don't use TFVC (Team Foundation Version Control), Source Safe, or any of the old functionally obsolete BS. And whatever you do, **stop using a shared network drive immediately**. 
Http.sys allows shared ports, so you can have multiple sites listening on 80 or 443 that switch on the host header. Also Windows auth if that's important to you
[Math.Max](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.math.max?view=netframework-4.7.2) and [Math.Min](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.math.min?view=netframework-4.7.2) do not have a designated `float` input. There may be some unboxing going on to fit one of the other types but more than likely your memory corruption occurs from the loss of 'precision' that occurs when comparing floats.
Even if that did work, you couldn't use it for a hashset of string data because the hashcode for a given string will vary between app domains.
I’ve used protocol buffers for similar problems. But I guess that you get same hash code for every key or that you read the data from a source with slow IO.
Unfortunately not being able to provide a minimum working example makes it pretty hard if not impossible for others to diagnose this...
You can build a hashset at compile time, simply enumerate the file as part of your build and generate a gigantic switch statement with a T4 template: bool Contains(string input) { switch(input) { &lt;% foreach(var line in file.ReadLines()) { %&gt; case '&lt;%=line.Trim()%&gt;': &lt;% } %&gt; return true; } return false; } https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/modeling/code-generation-and-t4-text-templates?view=vs-2017#design-time-t4-text-templates
 var ps = System.Management.Automation.PowerShell.Create(); ps.Commands.AddScript("Your stuff"); var results = ps.Invoke();
So after the update of the OP's question the answer is that the OP did not find a bug, it was already found 😁
There are `float`/`Single` overloads of [`Math.Min`]( https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.math.min?view=netframework-4.7.2#System_Math_Min_System_Single_System_Single_). If there wasn't such an overload, the two `float` arguments could be implicitly casted into `double`s and use `double Math.Min(double val1, double val2)`. But since that return value is a `double` it cannot be implicitly cast to `float` as that could lose information. So if `float Math.Min(float val1, float val2)` didn't exist, the program would not compile. Boxing refers to wrapping primitive types inside an `object`, which is stored at the heap instead of the stack.
&gt; java and objective c are old school for android. huh? did you mean java and objective c are old school for android and ios*, I mean I would disagree with that statement, most applications in the world are built with java. And most ios applications are built in objective-c. I'm pretty sure xamarin just ports it to java and objective c. &gt; building native apps in triplicate (ios, android, and c#) most likely just ios and android. But I do agree with c# is good for a lot of opportunities not within mobile development (unless they are looking for a unity developer). &gt; learn swift and kotlin Learn java. Unless you like working for garage startups you most likely won't be working a swift developer or kotlin developer position
NaNs? What happens if you use doubles instead of floats?
You answered exactly what I was curious about. Is the method shown the only one that is running? Are you running other (unmanaged) code at the same time? I've never seen what you are describing when running only managed code. I have seen the debugger cause problems though, especially with older versions of Visual Studio and x64 assemblies.
Xamarin can be nice for making some kinds of apps that run on both ios and android, but there is also some hassle and quirks when you do that rather than using the standard languages for those platforms. Whether it is worth it depends greatly on what you are making. Sometimes it may be better to write one app for ios, and another for android. 
it is not possible, unless dot net is broken, for floating point error or nans to cause memory corruption in safe c# code 
I use Git for some personal projects (GitHub hosts) and TFVC at work. I really have no problem with TFVC. Big difference being that I can have local commits with Git that I can then "sync" to the Git repo later on. &amp;#x200B; I just think their are pros and cons to both and I don't have a problem with either one. Anything specific that maybe I'm not considering?
learning java is not bad advice. There are a lot of legacy systems built in java (both on mobile and otherwise) but to pretend that Swift and Kotlin are only for "Garage Startups" is to significantly understate the popularity and the future prospects of these languages. 
I've used Xamarin for years, both native Xamarin and Forms. I love it. C# for mobile dev is totally viable. 
Go to LinkedIn and look for software positions. Then look at the ones that require knowing java vs the ones that require knowing swift and kotlin.
Except Rider does not have a free community edition which is a very big plus for VS.
I've been deving Xamarin apps for years. If you use .Forms, you don't need to triplicate. If you are running into platform specific problems, you should look at how you bootstrap your Xamarin.Forms app. You can inject platform specific dependencies into your DI container, which should allow you to work around any platform specific differences for your app. In my experience, you aren't forced into triplicating unless you're stuck and don't know what to do. Moving back to triplication is often due to lack of understanding and/or not enough time to work it out. 
It seriously does not even check for properly constructed classes? Well, now I'm a lot less thrilled for C# 8.0. Seems like a heavily half-baked solution.
What happens if you remove the innermost for loop? i always equal to 1?
Simple 2D game is what Unity is best at lol
You don’t know what he is doing with the structure after data is added. If he is doing Contains, List would kill performance.
[DO NOT SERIALIZE HASH CODE VALUES](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object.gethashcode) The hash algorithm depends on the runtime, so it is not guaranteed that each object always has the same hashcode if the app restarts, see the big yellow warning box at the bottom of the MSDN doc
Xamarin is getting very good. There is a bit of a learning curve, and occasionally mysterious build issues. Just be patient, and remember to clean, restart, and rebuild. Don't knock your head against a mysterious build issue until you at least clean the solution, restart visual studio, and rebuild the project. That will fix the issue most of the time.
it says that automation doesnt exist and that a reference to the assembly is missing &amp;#x200B;
Right click the project Add Reference Assemblies System.Management OK
Of course that's true today. But if someone is starting to learn Java today intending to be a mobile app developer in the future will they get where they are trying to go? Of course there will be (plenty of) jobs for java developers, that's not going away. So learning java isn't a bad thing but with google leaning into kotlin and ios leaning into swift there is a distinct possibility of learning java and then needing to learn swift/kotlin. 
&gt; HashSet add is amortized O(1). That’s not quite true in the worst case. If you add a bunch of objects with a non-standard equality comparer so they all have the same hash code, this will take O(n^2) time for n objects. This could also happen with standard comparers and bad luck (although for string comparers the implementation tries to mitigate this when the bucket lists exceed 100 items). Thus, it can’t be amortized O(1) worst case.
..on average. 
`struct` not `class` The problem here is that using `new` for a struct doesn't do anything and you can't have parameterless constructors for them. It is better than nothing and will catch a ton of "first year programmer" errors. 
still broken &amp;#x200B;
&gt; But if someone is starting to learn Java today intending to be a mobile app developer in the future will they get where they are trying to go? Yes. google leaning into kotlin and apple leaning into swift means promising futures. And are great languages to introduce new people to developing or hobbyists. However most companies don't have google or apple money. Taking on new languages that increment huge versions increases risk now. And the thing you are calling "legacy" code is not legacy code. People work in java projects everyday. Instagram is looking for java developers. It's awfully naive to act like learning java will make you go no where in life. If you work in enterprise software you would know that you simply can't convert java projects. There's too much risk, and there is a lot of enterprise software out there. You would find no stakeholder in enterprise software that would agree to converting simply because swift/kotlin are growing. So if you want to give advice, make sure you think what about if they can't afford to eat. Would you still give them advice to learn swift/kotlin.
bummer
Sure, there even was [a great talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNAbGpV1ZkU) on CppCon About it! The only thing I am implying is that the author is highly unlikely to have got used to using complex compile-time structures. Since the only way, he could have gotten access is by putting some effort: finding a library or writing a structure himself. &amp;#x200B;
Let stick to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/aeinwh/constructing_an_enormous_hardcoded_hashset_of/edqho14) thread of identical comments:)
&gt; It's awfully naive to act like learning java will make you go no where in life. I've gone way out of my way to say the opposite of that. Your insistence that swift and kotlin are nothing but toy languages for children is absurd. But finding a developer with a dogma isn't unique, it's so common as to be a stereotype. You've made your point and OP has some decisions to make. We're done here.
Unless the value is converted into one of the other types that does accept it. E.g long is an int64, int is int32. It's not a direct representation and may require type coercion to fit. This works the same way as with multiplication, where you can lose precision when multiplying two types that are numbers.
I jumped to core when it first came out. A few bumps along the way but it feels like I'm driving a Toyota (core) versus a heap of random parts assembled over the the last 20 years (4.x)
That's fair, I haven't written in Xamarin in a while and it's probably gotten much better than the last time I used it. Of course i am a little gun shy to fall for the "write once run everywhere" concept that has burned me in the past (years of flash development paid well but have no value in today's market)
In c#, string switch actually [compares the values one by one](https://sharplab.io/#v2:C4LghgzgtgPgAgBgARwIwG4CwAoOBmFAJiQGEkBvHJalAgIwHsGAbJAWQAo1kIBKCqjSEQA7gEtgAYwAWSDn0FDqlbErVJJkAKZIARGF0gUAdiTAATgFctWVeqGaIO3XUMmzVm4vsbteyW5wphbWtvYAvt5CQUgAZmDMTmE0kdjhQA==). So it won't have HashSet's performance.
Well clearly you haven't said the opposite when you say things like: &gt; But if someone is starting to learn Java today intending to be a mobile app developer in the future will they get where they are trying to go? and I'm not saying they are toy languages nor do I have a dogma, I mean for god sakes, we are having this conversation on /r/csharp . My point is if this person is trying to get into mobile development today, give them advice that provides them with many opportunities instead of a few opportunities TODAY.
Do you know any Javascript? I’m a .Net Dev but couldn’t really get into Xamarin. So I’ve been learning React/ React Native for the web mobile front ends and just using Web Api/EF for the backend
So it does. I'm not sure why I thought it might do it differently. Though if you have enough case statements it does this check with a compile time hash of the string using this function: internal static uint ComputeStringHash(string s) { uint num = default(uint); if (s != null) { num = 2166136261u; for (int i = 0; i &lt; s.Length; i++) { num = (s[i] ^ num) * 16777619; } } return num; } https://sharplab.io/#v2:C4LghgzgtgPgAgBgARwIwG4CwAoOBmFAJiQGEkBvHJalAgIwHsGAbJAWQAo1kIBKCqjSEQA7gEtgAYwAWSDn0FDqlbErVJJkAKZIARGF0gki9dU0QduuoeOrTNc5ck2Tpx3oAmLu/Y3a9Wt6+Zv66AGZBwe66AOY2KADsSMAATgCuWlg+SgC+rjRwSWFgzBZZQnnYOUA

Cut out the relevant bits and obscure any sensitive details.
Right. There are valid use cases, which is why I’m asking.
I believe I've used the `AfterResolveReferences` target or something like that in the past. It was for a WiX project so that target may only exist for WiX projects.

I know a little javascript. But I tend to stay away from it. I saw alot of devs are using javascript for webapps, but are they truly native apps when using this method? I've looked at Dart and flutter too, which I guess can be cross platform. I guess I have mixed feelings about using javascript 
tbh Visual Studio is literally the only piece of software that keeps me from running Fedora instead of windows. Anything else I use (any videogames I play etc) work fine on Wine.
**Clean Code** \-&gt; Learning to split code **Microsoft .NET architecting applications for the enterprise** \-&gt; Thought me a lot about OOP, finally was clear after this book **Software Architecture in Practice** \-&gt; Qualities of software, how to define them and tactics to reach better levels in them **Extreme Programming Explained** \-&gt; Trying to work as a programmer who can write code that can change (how Agile process can be accompanied by coding principles and practices to achieve its goal of being agile) **The art of unit testing** \-&gt; How it is more about making code testable than the writing of the unit tests themselves **Working Effectively with Legacy Code** \-&gt; Tactics to keep it working but to start breaking it apart **Dependency injection in .NET** \-&gt; More info on how to decouple your implementation from its contracts and the effect of this in unit testing &amp;#x200B; Many scientific research articles on software evolution and software maintenance. Use **Google scholar** to see how www was invented or where the theory of "put things together that change together" came from. For books my main place to go has been **SafariBooksOnline** since 2006 (even though in the recent years it started to function slower and slower). To learn the basics about a new tech library or tool, I look at **PluralSight**. Give yourself 10 years. Work on many different real life projects. In the meantime while working on solving the problems you face, look for solutions other people found about it. These would be then in the books, videos or posts online. Specific to problems you face, you look for the resources. Especially about design patterns. Reading the design patterns book over and over is not going to get you much further. Only when you see the problem, can you efficiently look in that book to try and find what solutions were invented. Then why it does and doesn't solve your problem. Next to the resources, working with senior developers and learning from them would help you faster. In software engineering there are no "right" ways to start a program or make a project "successful". There are better and worse ways to deal with each situation. In the field we have only reached to consencus on just a bunch of best practices yet, which are mentioned in the books listed in the answers from many people here. For the rest, we don't have formulas to make "successful" projects. The definition of success differs from project to project. 
Been developing with xamarin professionally for the past year... When I started 12 months ago it was unpredictable and completely unreliable - partly due to the dreaded PCL library where the xamarin platform did not play nice. 8 months ago we switched to net standard and with most VS updates it got better, but too often an update to VS would cause something to completely break... I remember a post on Reddit where an update broke xamarin for the masses (v15.6 0-15.6.1)Fast forward to today, the past 3-5 months have actually been fantastic and completely stable! I feel like we started a bit too early, but today yes it's a great choice and I would recommend - just be prepared for the occasional head scratching and sometimes having to deal with poor documentation for the less used features (iOS notification extension anyone?) - although for simple things it's pretty decent!
Let us know when Apple rewrites iOS in Swift, or Google does the same with AOSP source code.
Yes, probably the best should be taking a look at the MSIL code and compare that with for example an LLVM IR to see whats wrong
This guy has to be trolling, right?
Does System.Data support it yet? Because until it does I this feature is useless to me. 
Judging by the way OP wrote their question, I seriously doubt they have any practical C++ experience whatsoever.
How does this code perform? var objs = table.AsEnumerable() .Select(row =&gt; new MyObject { Id = int.TryParse(row["OBJECT_ID"]?.ToString(), out int id) ? id : 0 }) .ToList(); Don't rely on Exceptions as logical code-flow. That'll make any loop very expensive.
To appease management we must make stupid sacrifices, like performance. I've had one of my prototype ideas dismissed because of the wrong background color. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
When I built the last thing I worked on with cefsharp I built the whole thing like a single page java script application. To change the content I just passed data from the back end to the front end by calling a js method with data which then took said data and turned it into the appropriate html and attached it to the page/removed the currently attached html. This worked pretty well to the point it functions like a standard application (my entire application just used a html ui). Maybe you could use something similar? I think if you actually change the content of the browser you are always going to get some amount of flicker as it is reloading the content just like any browser but I could be wrong on this. 
You're gonna have to meet us at least half-way here. They've done 80% for you, now you can figure out the rest. Have you even tried to add the using statement?
Yes, I've added using system.managment.automation; but it returns the same error
Oh, you are completely right:) That changes everything. Thanks!
It is still linear time, just a sequence of assembly compare and jump instructions instead of calls for string equality. But it is pretty quick for fairly large lists.
OPEN COMMENTS BOIS PREPARE THE PASTA
Did you think about tests?
Hell yes. I've written so much code around the fact that you can't yield in an async method. Problem is, it's all in .NET framework, and I'm sure it's not going to get this feature...
You should upload the sample project on GitHub or somewhere similar. I could take a look at it and test some things. If nothing helps eventually wed have to file a regression issue for the visual studio. I know that the vs team would be really psyched to have an existing repro with issue... But also have issue actually filed.... Lots of problems with vs eventually drown within stack overflow and Reddit without being filed.
That's really neat, I'll give it a try on some of my existing code. 
It should do! IAsyncEnumerable is a C# feature not a .NET Core/Framework feature. When exactly it makes it there may be another issue. 
&gt; IAsyncEnumerable is a C# feature not a .NET Core/Framework feature. Several C# features require framework support. And it's already been announced that several C# 8.0 features won't be supported for the full .NET Framework.
Async streams will be available when you target .NET Standard 2.1, and the .NET Framework will not get .NET Standard 2.1 support. So you will have to do without. https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/11/12/building-c-8-0/
Yeah that’s understandable, I’ve generally avoided Javascript before picking up react, which I’m enjoying. It’s properly native as far as I can tell, is doesn’t run in a view or anything. It’s worth trying a couple of walkthrough app tutorials, see if the things you don’t like about Javascript are still relevant
Boo! Well that's pretty lame. Although it's correct that 4.8 will not, but that doesn't mean no future version won't (Although it might be a wait). There is no way that .NET Framework will just give up supporting future .NET Standard versions. It will make the entire point of the standard moot. 
&gt; Although it's correct that 4.8 will not, but that doesn't mean no future version won't (Although it might be a wait). There are no further plans for the .NET Framework. The plan is to push migration towards .NET Core. I can't find the source anymore, but it's very likely that 4.8 will be the last version of the .NET Framework. &gt; It will make the entire point of the standard moot. You do know that .NET Standard supports more than just .NET Core and .NET Framework, right?
Unfortunately Microsoft said that they do not want to risk making changes to .NET Framework. So unless you can build it using a Nuget package, you're not going to see it. And that's a problem for this feature because to be useful it needs to be backed into the low-level libraries such as System.IO and System.Data. *** Yes ORM fans, that affects you too. Just because you don't use System.Data directly doesn't mean your ORM doesn't need IAsyncEnumerable to offset the async tax.
Probably because the majority of your comments are always negative or condescending. But you do you
&gt;You do know that .NET Standard supports more than just .NET Core and .NET Framework, right? What do you mean supports? You mean more than just .NET Core and .NET Framework implements the standard? Yes. But if a platform wishes to say they support .NET Standard X.X, then they need to implement everything defined in that standard. It would be a huge deal for a platform to just stop implementing parts of the standard. Libraries would essentially have to stop using all new features. &gt;There are no further plans for the .NET Framework. Not quite true. It's that there won't be much "innovation" going forward because of backwards compatibility issues. So... Less development but it's not dead. https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2018/10/10/net-keynote.aspx
[https://xenko.com/](https://xenko.com/) seems to be C# gamedev from what I can tell
&gt; I think if Framework just decided they weren't going to support .NET Standard and never would, it would be a pretty big issue. Yea. It is a pretty big issue. That's why they are spending so much effort on getting windows-only libraries such as WPF and WinForms to run on .NET Framework. While there probably will be a .NET Framework 4.9 with security patches or high DPI fixes, /u/AngularBeginner's right in saying that currently have no plans to support C# 8 or future versions of .NET Standard.
&gt; it's very likely that 4.8 will be the last version of the .NET Framework Yeeaaahhh.... I'll believe that when I see it. The way Microsoft still supports legacy technologies (hello [VB.NET](https://VB.NET) and WCF in .NET Core) I think parking .NET Framework at a maintenance release level is still a long way off.
TBH I feel like that's too much work to demand from the OP, since it's fixed in 4.7.2
Didn't see that bit about 4.7.2. Glad it's working
Xamarin forms with .net standard 2.0 is great. You rarely need to implement platform specific code. It's been really stable and reliable in the past year and the tools and libraries keep getting bigger. The biggest gripe is that it's relatively undocumented officially. Otherwise it's great and stable and the fact that C# is such a capable language means working on xamarin will still prepare you for other kinds of development (like WPF for instance)
I could pull some of this functionality out into a .NET Standard library. Correction: I *will* pull some of this functionality out into a .NET Standard library.
Just say fuck it and make an SSRS report with the capabilities of what you're trying to do with a word document. This is from personal experience.
/u/grauenwolf maintains an ORM and asked a legitimate question. Personal flamewars are not a good reason to downvote someone.
Firstly, we have Visual Studio for Mac is Xamarin/MonoDevelop, isn't it? Secondly, I believe there is a big rewrite coming for OS X, they're ripping out Xamarin/MonoDevelop and unifying codebase with Visual Studio on Windows. With this under way, I don't think it's going to take that much extra resources to have to ported to linux at the same time as well.
/u/grauenwolf maintains an ORM and asked a legitimate question pertaining to his work. Personal flamewars are not a good reason to downvote someone. &gt;Does System.Data support it yet? Because until it does this feature is useless to me. Asking the question isn't bad. The comment after is what makes it condescending. And yeah I know about the much publicized ORM 
Are you familiar with https://github.com/Dasync/AsyncEnumerable ?
Just chiming in with our process: Github for version control, TeamCity for build pipelines, though we're exploring migrating to Azure DevOps for the latter and potentially both. I would not personally work for a company that didn't have these essential parts of the build process at _least_ on the radar for "must implement ASAP" because doing things the way you've described (and I've done things exactly that way) is a nightmare comparatively. 
 There is nothing "condensending" about saying, "without X, I cannot use Y". If anything it's useful information to those making Y. 
Indeed, that's something I sometimes do not consider since I am more than willing to pay for Rider and have the income to do such at thing. But I completely understand if someone is in a different situation. For what it is worth, Jetbrains does offer free versions of their other IDEs so things may change with Rider, but as you said, now is not the case. 
Both are fine languages. In my experience, the choice of technology stack is composed of a variety of factors. Available libraries for whatever problem domain you're working in, what sort of community you're hoping to pull your new developers from, and (a lot of the time with existing companies, this is dominant) what language your existing software assets and personnel have been using already. If you want a technical breakdown of why to choose C#, here ya go. It's long: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/125712/for-what-reasons-should-i-choose-c-over-java-and-c
My [32 bit RNG](https://gist.github.com/Zhentar/106426a4639f248770fa55ad83be8875) does exactly that for floats: `new FloatUnion(0x3F800000U | (GetHash(position++) &gt;&gt; 9)).FloatVal - 1.0f;` which gets you a float between 0 and 1 (and notably with even precision across the entire range of values). Double would need a different constant &amp; shift (`0x3FF00000_00000000ul` &amp; 12 bits, I believe) 
I have found another solution which is instead of a multiple of four, I took the matches - 4 equals the number of matches to remove. So computer = matches and bam it works :)
I know it doesn't give you an awaitable IEnumerable, but this SO answer is an interesting approach to give you the same benefits https://stackoverflow.com/a/23869010 Basically they don't return anything from the awaitable method (except Task). They then push one row at a time into a publisher method in a loop, awaiting the result. That gives the control flow back to the caller and gets one row at a time processed.
Fortunately the [proposal](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/proposals/async-streams.md) is not tied to a particular implementation. &gt; foreach will be augmented to support IAsyncEnumerable&lt;T&gt; in addition to its existing support for IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;. And it will support the equivalent of IAsyncEnumerable&lt;T&gt; as a pattern if the relevant members are exposed publicly So like IEnumerable with foreach, it should be possible to copy-paste the types and the new language features should work. The downside is that it would be harder to interoperate across codebases without a common type.
The problem with `await rdr.ReadAsync()` is that it potentially allocates an object for every row, making it far more expensive than necessary. But on the next layer up I do like the approach you offered. 
Not an exhaustive list, just some I haven't seen in this thread: [FNA](https://fna-xna.github.io/) is a re-implementation of XNA / MonoGame. There is also [Raylib-cs](https://github.com/ChrisDill/Raylib-cs) which is a C# binding of [RayLib](https://www.raylib.com/) 
Didn't put this in the main text because that was getting pretty long. &amp;nbsp; I know how I could potentially fix this issue and provide what would seem to be a "by ref" approach. Essentially, I could pass the information required to create the object that would typically need serialization to the plugin and the plugin would create it on its end. Anytime it needs to use that object it could validate no changes against the parent using only messaging and if no changes then provide the object otherwise re-construct a new object to use with the change. That'll be a huge mess but would work.
I have only a passing familiarity with Java, so I can't make a fair comparison of the languages. Whay I do like about C#, besides the language itself, is everything that comes with it: - ASP.NET (I do mostly web dev at work) - .NET in general. Three languages that play well together, plus PowerShell. Makes for less fuddling about. - Plays very well with the whole Microsoft cloud stack, as one would expect. Deploying to Azure is almost too easy.
I'd say this is a start: https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2018/12/04/announcing-open-source-of-wpf-windows-forms-and-winui-at-microsoft-connect-2018/
SqlDataAdapters and datatables are terribly slow. Any of these other solutions people have offered will be faster for you.
&gt; The downside is that it would be harder to interoperate across codebases without a common type. I am so happy that I don't need to support Silverlight, .net 4.5, or windows phone any more. I had so many interfaces that were just back-ported versions of Microsoft code. 
When I started with my current company we had a mixture of code in SVN and code on file shares and local computers. What we have found, which may not apply in your situation, is that the code that was never in source control to begin with is that we have lost the deployed version of code as devs moved on and so we have had to decompile applications to recreate when updates are needed. Even though we also sometimes have only 1 dev on a project at a time we now religiously use source control, have migrated to TFS on-premise and are moving towards TFS build and release management for our pipeline. It’s pretty slick to just check in code and have it automatically kick off a build and deploy to our development servers, then QA and production servers as we progress through the development cycle. I would recommend looking at TFS on-premise, Azure DevOps (formerly visual Studio team services).
Check out my library [Veldrid](https://github.com/mellinoe/veldrid) if you are looking for a low-level, portable graphics library that runs on .NET Core. It supports a lot of [modern GPU features](https://mellinoe.github.io/veldrid-docs/articles/intro.html) that other libs are missing, and is backed by Vulkan, Direct3D 11, Metal, and OpenGL (ES). [ImGui.NET](https://github.com/mellinoe/imgui.net) is a really good option for building dev tools or editors (yes, I'm biased because I also made this). [Example](https://mellinoe.github.io/images/editor-gui-wide.png) of an editor I've built. Veldrid does graphics only, but there's a number of other modular pure-C# libraries (for audio, [physics](https://github.com/bepu/bepuphysics2), [networking](https://github.com/lidgren/lidgren-network-gen3), etc.) that make it very feasible to get a nice, modern, homegrown framework off the ground. This route is going to be a lot more time-consuming than using MonoGame or a pre-built engine, but depending on your goals it could be more interesting.
I believe MessageBox.Show just creates a standard WinAPI message box rather than a window with a customizable layout.
So the likely solution is to create a custom message box? 
I don't keep too current with Java, but I think these all still hold reasonably well. * Real Generics, not type erasure. (Java's are effectively just compiler annotations; .NET generics are fully integrated into the type system, runtime enforced, reflectable). * Strong native interop (easy to use for COM &amp; P/Invoke and mostly pretty fast, and very fast &amp; capable in advanced scenarios with C++/CLI) * Iterator methods; `yield return` makes writing generators trivial with state management handled automatically. (This also applies to async methods, though I don't use them much so not a big deal to me personally) * In general, the .NET JIT is much less capable than JVM JIT implementations - because it hasn't had to be. The language &amp; standard library has done a better job of designing for performance; e.g. value types significantly reduce heap allocations so there's much less need for escape analysis. * Boxing of value types works in a far more sensible &amp; transparent way than Java's boxed primitives.
Yes, that should work if your regular windows are scaled properly.
&gt; Strong native interop (easy to use for COM &amp; P/Invoke and mostly pretty fast, and very fast &amp; capable in advanced scenarios with C++/CLI) This could be considered both good and bad. Good for the reasons you mentioned, bad because it encourages people to use natives instead of writing in C# which isn't portable across OSes.
besides everything you typed out here blowing my mind, I find it delightfully American of you to call a company of 700 people "small".
You have to have PowerShell on the machine and actually browse for the library in the PowerShell folder. It doesn't exist by default
+1 for Open xml for being a pain in the ass... however.... I have a project that contains multiple tables and I've found the quickest (laziest) way to work out things like this is to actually create it in Word manually, save the docx then using OpenXML SDK Tool, open the document and ask it to generate the code. It essentially recreates the docx in C# . It's not always clean code but it gives you a head start in understanding how things are done.
You're right, completely forgot about that.
Completely forgot that, good point.
Are you calling the Application.EnableVisualStyles() method from the Main method before invoking the Show method of Dialog?
Nice. These look good.
Na it's not hard for me. I can use Unity. I just want to see what else there is with C# that people make. &amp;#x200B;
Application.EnableVisualStyles() is already declared in Program.cs
I'll probably end up doing this.
I'm not a game dev, but I have to say that save yourself lots of pain and just use Unity for 2D. Stuff like Monogame needs you to make physics for a lot of stuff, even if you already know physics then know that it will not be as easy in real life. And Monogame will not learn you anything useful for game dev since you will use game engines anyway. It's also not documented well in internet. Just go for Unity. 
I've already had a job using Unity and want to develop my skills outside of it. I know it's not the easiest way to make a game but I'm just messing around with other languages and just building stuff for fun. Also Unity is super bloated for little pixels games that I want to make (320x240). It's still a 3D engine and it feel like I'm fighting it most of the time with what I'm doing.
&gt; native isn't portable across OSes \*necessarily Depends on what the native is.
I'd suggest asking in r/Unity3D or r/Unity2D rather than here, as they probably know Unity better than r/csharp does. I'd help you if I could, but it's a year or two since I last touched Unity, and I'm not in the mindset of how Unity handles things anymore. Either way, lycka till!

I'm sure you could find some magic solution in `System.Reflection` but it's easier to just take the caller as a parameter if you control all three projects. Also I would recommend restructuring your project because just needing to know this is a sign of bad design.
**Why** do you need to know this? What are you going to do with that information?
Which framework version is this? (Keep in mind that Windows Forms + HiDpi is going to be an uphill battle for you.)
I tried Winforms with .net 4.7.2. Setting font size as 8.25pt and font as Segoe UI and High DPI automatically works without any extra efforts. Did you try that?
Not sure, but this *might* be fixed in .NET Framework 4.8. [The release notes mention a lot of DPI-related fixes in the WinForms Section.](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet-framework-early-access/blob/master/release-notes/NET48/dotnet-48-changes.md)
Yeah. Form1 is already DPI aware so the label and button would scale if i change it in Settings. The only problem is whenever you call in a Message Box and the text becomes blurry. 
.NET 4.7.2 
C# gives you more options. Game dev is pretty much restricted to C++ and C#. C# works with Unity and CryEngine. Java has zero big game engine support. Want to make a web app? Sure, there are lots of fragmented Java frameworks, but nothing nearly as concise or well-supported as [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET). Want to make an iOS app? Zero support. You can do it with C# though. UWP app? Not in Java. What does Java support that C# doesn't, in terms of platform targets? C# has one of the highest number of supported platforms and application types of any language that I'm aware of.
thanks for the response. I posted at Unity2D as well, but you never know if anyone here would catch it up either.
I'll third the why. Given you're wording I'm making a guess your new to C# and .Net. Please share us at least a generalized example and what you're trying to do. We can hopefully help you understand what you're attempting to structure, there will almost certainly be an easier way to do what your attempting. Reflection is the answer but nearly every time you look at using reflection it means it's time to go back to the drawing board and review your design.

Wave engine would be a good shout i think, [https://waveengine.net/](https://waveengine.net/)
Hrm. I'll give that a shot and get back to ya.
NICE! Was easy to implement, and this gives me a consistent result of about a 28.5% increase in speed over doing division!
While this isn't completely solvable you might find that F# does more than c# in this regard
MessageBox() is fully DPI aware.
The .NET JIT isn't as much less capable as it used to be.
They are very similar, overall worrying about which is better or not better is usually a waste of time. What ultimately might dominate the answer to that questions is "Which language has a better ecosystem for solving my problem?" Like if Java had a better FooBar parsing library than C#, and the bulk of your problem is parsing FooBar, maybe go with Java. I think the main notable difference is that C# has value types and other tools for working with memory explicitly, ref returns, span&lt;t&gt;, etc. For problems that need great performance, these can be immensely useful. The JVM does a great job of handling memory for you, so Java programmers can not worry about it and still get decent performance in most cases. But C# lets you hand tune things to be even better. Soon, C# will offer SIMD intrinsics which will be another massive performance opportunity. 
Let's face reality, .NET Framework is dead - it may live on as a zombie, but this is what MS does now. They won't say it's dead, just like "WPF" and "Windows Forms" aren't "dead" but you can tell they aren't living. Zombies.
Exactly the same for me! Wielding dual boot on both my systems at the time
For people interested, I was unable to find a solution to interact with GAL through EWS 2.0, and ended up writing a small module that contains the methods I needed through PowerShell. My google foo might not be up to par for this, but I was unable to find any thing on interaction with Exchange online thourhg C# or EWS 2.0.
That is bad practice, it is an anti pattern, it is exactly opposite of what programming suppose to be. If you want the object behave differently then pass an enum as a parameter.
That is kind of weird thinking. It would mean, for example, that I can't make a 3d game on linux or macosx, because allowing high performance FFI might encourage someone to do a bad thing. Anyway, Java's overhead for FFI is the same as C#s last I saw it measured. 
My guess is that you have not implemented GetHashCode correctly, like always returning 0 or something. That would definitely explain the long loading time
Your issue is that a coroutine is not a regular method, It occurs simultaneously to your other code. The StartCoroutine method does exactly what its name implies: It *starts* the coroutine. so your code is starting the corputine, and immediately checks if the variable stopTime has changed. Of course the variable hasnt changed because the coroutine hasnt completed yet
I think it's just the fact that the "useless"is a pretty strong and negative word. There's many ways to get the point across without using such words.
Hi Jerry, You have probably already understood this, but i just wanted to add my comment anyway. Please do move to version control, there are so many upsides to running a project with version control. For me the most important reason is code history, you are always able to go back and retrieve code that you might at some point have discarded. But also its simple to implement especially if you are already using Visual Studio for as your dev environment, and it's just so much better than a network backup.
I know it is, I got it working with a previous program I made for generating contracts by just replacing the contents of the document and inserting data into the table at the bottom (didn't need to add rows unlike this one), This one is proving to be more complicated in the portion of editing and adding rows to the table. SSRS report sounds good, but I think we are looking more for just generating the table in word based on entered values in the GUI from the C# application. Pulling that data from a database won't work because I don't yet have a database that contains it yet, and there will be instances where we will be using this program without an internet connection so the availability of the database is going to be an issue, it's best that it's just a program that generates these reports and can work offline without a Database of any kind. The DB I currently Have working is a MySQL database.
That's the thing, I already have a table in the word document, the coordination of it is off for reasons I don't understand and adding new rows is a pain. So after you create the table in the word document, what do you add in the C# code for edits, insertions, and adding rows?
Thank you All! I appreciate the comments. It appears there are different opinions. I appreciate all comments. This has been helpful. I now need to decide how I personally want to approach this.
Just ran into an issue, I am getting a runtime error for PowerShell 2.0. This is the first time seeing this when I pull up the PM console in VS. I am googling this issue now
Create an object called MailAddress - it will parse it for you and allow you to get the Host property
Its primary purpose is to confuse people reading the code. I wouldn't do it. :)
It's an online course? 
The parentheses are redundant, probably just how the instructor learned the syntax. I'd suggest to your friend to not pick up or get attached to little quirks like that. In a professional software development environment, you should strive to make code feel like it was written by the same person. This allows (IMO) new teammates or future maintainers to adapt to the code base quicker, as they don't have to learn the little syntax quirks different developers had. 
This. Parentheses are usually used in mathematical expressions etc but the language rules allow them to be used even when not needed. So it’s ok grammatically to put parens around basically anything, but it’s not rational and it definitely doesn’t help. Like can be seen here. I would send a question to the person doing this why they are doing it and be careful that there aren’t other weird practices in their material. 
While some errors can only be caught at runtime, I'd like to catch implementation issues (like when some bozo requires a class to implement "magic methods"), when someone is passing a specific value that is not allowed, constrain strings to ones contained in a static class (mimicking Java enums), etc.
Idiocy. Tell the instructor to stop and possibly consider his life choices.
what is a **sortener**?
Yeah, it's a course from Udemy. "Complete C# Unity developer 2D", the guy is Ben Tristem
realistically nobody is going to dedicate large amounts of their free time teaching a stranger on the internet how to do something they could teach themselves with a bit of discipline, sorry.
Unit tests? Those won't run during code edit, right? What I want to do is have errors &amp; warning messages displayed in Visual Studio, similar to how it happens for syntax errors or when say, Resharper gives suggestions. I guess the difference is that I want to provide messages based on use. For example: * A caller is passing a specific value that is not allowed. * An idiot made it where an implementer of some interface needs to include a magical static method. * A system uses structs for performance reasons, but most of that is lost if a struct provides non-blittable members. * A method has a string parameter that must be one of a limited set of values. I was thinking code contracts could do this. I like its idea of applying attributes with lambdas that are used to test conditions. I just want that to work while editing source code.
You have to power through and learn it yourself. There's not gonna be a point where you know everything, you will be teaching yourself new frameworks/languages/libraries the rest of your career, so you might as well start getting the hang of it now.
I give a look later. Maybe he got comments or code style for the course
Do the plugins *have* to be in a separate process?
ReSharper/Rider have [contract annotations](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Contract_Annotations.html). They're limited to null/notnull/true/false/halt though.
Use [Substring](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string.substring?view=netframework-4.7.2) and [IndexOf](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string.indexof?view=netframework-4.7.2) the '@' symbol along with the string.length to work it out
 You'll have to understand he's not a developer, he's a teacher. He is not going to teach best practices, just how to do things. I think it's ok to learn the process of making things, but don't take away basically any of his coding practices.
It's for sortening things of course. I usually sorten things manually but sometimes I wish I had a tool to do it for me.
Oh cool. I've never encountered political correctness run amuck in real life. Now I can check that off my list. "Better be careful old man, or you may offend an inanimate object."
Slight correction there. WPF and WinForms aren't zombies and have numerous features planned for the future. That's why they were carried over to .NET Core. Silverlight is a much better example. They still haven't formally admitted that its dead despite their own browser not supporting it.
Having non-nullable classes inside structs should be a warning (or error) by itself, then.
Are you overriding the OnCreate method. Can you post what you have gotten so far?
Yes, I am overriding the OnCreate method. Let me share what I have done. This is using Reactive UI. https://pastebin.com/utcHVXZv This is using INotifyPropertyChanged https://pastebin.com/QXEv0eEw Any other info, that night be needed? I am currently reading the docs for ReactiveUI. This is my first attempt at Xamarin. 
In each and every instance where I've ever used Java, I've ended up fighting with the CLASSPATH and JAR files to the point that I'm literally in tears trying to find something that works. I've never once had any problems like that with C#.
So not really relavent to the question but I have to do this while writing Lanas RDMLX for our IBM i system. You can declare a string with quotes or double quotes but to access methods like replace you have to wrap the string in parentheses! Drives me nuts. E.g.: ("Replace Me"). Replace('Me', 'You')
It's a binary search, so logarithmic.
If you're defining the string right there, why would you need to use the Replace method?
Just an example to show how it needs to be structured. In an actual program I would parameterize the called and use variables. 
Depends on how badly an open source project wants extra help.
Well what do you want to learn how to do?
Sorry, I don't know any books, but since you mention OOP principles, if you're making a WPF/UWP/Xamarin app, you'll come across INotifyPropertyChanged. If you're doing web, just ignore me. It's a concept that was surprisingly well-hidden, and I think you'll appreciate being aware that it exists.
The compiler doesn't add any "default null checks". The check is done at runtime by the CLR, and this will remain. I don't see how this will cause any performance improvement. This is purely about type safety.
I agree with your point. Also about your second point I get that can be frustrating however I see sometimes people asking a question only for someone to reply with a sarcastic answer or being rude.
What do you need a mentor for? I understand that you want to learn C# but how much knowledge do you have right now? I myself study C# at the moment but I'm not a professional or any pro at it. I can teach you the basics if you want to but I'm a student as well so free time is not one of my strong sides. I can get you started though. If you want to.
Honestly you would probably want to work with video material where they continuously work on a single project expanding it with new material as a hands-on learner. I liked TeamTreeHouse's video courses a lot and they use the same project continuously and does not require you to setup software locally so you can focus on learning c# using just the browser. If you have a Microsoft account you are eligible to get 1 or 3 months of Pluralsight (another good video site) for free by going to https://my.visualstudio.com and using their link for it. I myself have used that for learning Asp.Net Core MVC and API.
Udemy have some good offers on at the moment. Just picked up the wpf matesterclass one for less than a tenner. 
Udemy isn't curated for quality, so there's a lot of garbage on there. Buyer beware.
Cool! That's kind of what I'm looking for.
Your not going to go too far wrong at a tenner. I went through an entire udemy course on unity last week. The content was concise and interesting. Can't vouch for this one but it had a large number of positive reviews 
Does nothing, has 0 compile or runtime effect
Dont know if they are going to be any good for a visual learner, but take a look at this website they are all [free!](https://books.goalkicker.com/)
Head First C# is great for a hands-on kind of person. It's pretty much all project-based. Aside from that, online courses are the next best thing. Not specifically about C#, but I do like the Apress [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) MVC 5 book as it is also is project-based and walks you through testing, IOC, and other things. That may be a good next step if you want to learn [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET). Most things in that book translate well to application development outside the web too.
Exaggeration much?
More precisely, the compiler emits exactly the same code in both situations, whereby it, by definition, has no runtime difference either. 
They also have structs, pointers, &amp; stack allocation.
It's not required but we're trying to go for strong isolation here where a plugin has no chance of taking down the application. &amp;nbsp; per https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn519924.aspx &gt; No isolation: Run host and all plug-ins in a single process with a single AppDomain. &gt; Medium isolation: Load each plug-in in its own AppDomain. &gt; Strong isolation: Load each plug-in in its own process. &amp;nbsp; I feel like maybe you were going to suggest going just the AppDomain route? The same guy who wrote up the article also goes into detail about how the AppDomain approach won't protect host from a failing plugin (https://ikriv.com/dev/dotnet/AppDomains) &amp;nbsp; If there is another way I'm all ears!

You mean the test solution we were using? If you were referring to the original project, I'm not sure how kosher it would be. This is at a large company and I'm pretty sure most of the stuff is proprietary. I'd probably end up needing to go through mountains of red tape just to get permission to post part of it.
Just out of interest, why not just migrate stuff to .NET Core? I'm not a software developer by profession, so I have no idea what kind of problems you'd face
If you’re willing to pay.
It doesn't really bother me, but I think it's not that people are offended, I think people are just thinking you're a bit of a Debbie downer focusing on how it's useless for you

I’d google C# cheat sheet. Or there’s a great, free book on Amazon “learn C# in one day and learn it well” it’s more detailed than the cheat sheet, but because it offers, examples details and use cases. Which are probably necessary if you are starting from 0. But ultimately the idea of loops, variables and functions (methods) don’t change too much between either language 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXmVym6L8dw&amp;list=PLAC325451207E3105 My favorite resource to learning C#. This guys knows his stuff.
If you're not going to use braces we're going to have a problem ;p 
Then prove me wrong. Demonstrate a case where you think it will actually be useful despite the lack of BCL supporting classes.
Moshi is great for C# related stuff I think.
What you are aiming for is simultaneous creation of the singleton : 2 threads checking the object existence and both thinking it still needs to be created. What happens if you would separate the Thread creation and Start into separate consecutive loops? Currently the second thread still needs to be created before it can be started. So the first thread gets some head start. 
Try to initialize all threads first and then start them all: Thread[] threads = new Thread[10]; for (int i = 0; i &lt; threads.Length; i++) threads[i] = new Thread(start); for (int i = 0; i &lt; threads.Length; i++) threads[i].Start();
&gt;counter: 1 from instance 63835064 &gt; &gt;counter: 3 from instance 63835064 &gt; &gt;counter: 0 from instance 63835064 &gt; &gt;counter: 0 from instance 6044116 &gt; &gt;counter: 2 from instance 63835064 &gt; &gt;counter: 4 from instance 63835064 &gt; &gt;counter: 5 from instance 63835064 &gt; &gt;counter: 6 from instance 63835064 &gt; &gt;counter: 7 from instance 63835064 &gt; &gt;counter: 8 from instance 63835064 Thank you, it "works":-)
It's definitely not thread safe, neither the singleton initialization nor the counter increment. static void Main() { var rst = new ManualResetEventSlim(false); var instances = new HashSet&lt;object&gt;(); var counters = new List&lt;int&gt;(); var threads = new List&lt;Thread&gt;(); int threadCount = Environment.ProcessorCount * 2; for (int i = 0; i &lt; threadCount; i++) { var t = new Thread(() =&gt; { rst.Wait(); var (counter, instance) = ConsoleLogger.Instance().Log(); lock (counters) { counters.Add(counter); instances.Add(instance); } }); threads.Add(t); t.Start(); } rst.Set(); foreach (var t in threads) t.Join(); Console.WriteLine($"Threads: {threadCount}"); Console.WriteLine($"Instances: {instances.Count}"); Console.WriteLine($"Counters: {counters.Distinct().Count()} uniques ({String.Join(" ", counters.OrderBy(c =&gt; c))})"); Console.ReadLine(); } } class ConsoleLogger { private static ConsoleLogger _instance; private volatile int _counter = 0; private ConsoleLogger() { } public static ConsoleLogger Instance() =&gt; _instance ?? (_instance = new ConsoleLogger()); public (int counter, object instance) Log() =&gt; (_counter++, this); }
it has no impact. your professor is just a bad programmer.
If _counter were static, you wouldn't get double 0's in the count. Not sure if that matters to you.
an amazing example, thanks!

Illustrated C# - by Daniel Solis
You’re assigning the same values over and over to the last items in the correctSums and mySums arrays. Change the assignment to correctsums[i] = array1[i] + array2[i]; and mySums[i] = Console.ReadLine(); and the arrays should contain the right values. 
Well, it is just easier to load plugins in their own app domain. Are the plugins expected to always reside on the same machine as the parent app? If so, and you require isolation by process, you can use WCF with named pipe bindings. You can send messages to the plugin in which a separate library, written by you, receives and parses the message. Plugins would be expected to reference this library and use the API it exposes. This way, they don't really have to mess with any of the WCF stuff. Unfortunately, this doesn't solve your serialization issue. The messages you send will have to be verbose enough that your plugin library knows how to create the types you couldn't serialize. The trick will be keeping the host app and the plugin library's state in sync. Much of this can be accomplished if you expose a duplex WCF contract, allowing the plugin to receive callback messages about state changes without having to poll the service.
Thank you for sharing, I will take a look
Not sure if this is an academic question, or if you're interested in making thread-safe code. [Use the Lazy keyword.](http://csharpindepth.com/articles/general/singleton.aspx#lazy)
Don’t know if it should be qualifies as a full textbook.. but it will definitely get you started and learning a lot at a great rate. It is quite short. C# pro 7 would make a better textbook in my opinion 
damn, honestely I think I'm fucked, I don't know how to do the rest, because I don't know the basics, &amp;#x200B; but I will tryto type it in, thanks
`Lazy` isn't a keyword, it's a type.
Here's a similar example in JavaScript: `12.toString(2)` &gt; VM109:1 Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token `(12).toString(2)` &gt; "1100"
For a lot of this, one could rely on built in code snippets. Example, to insert for loop, type "for&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;" List of snippets here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/visual-csharp-code-snippets?view=vs-2017
Just don’t forget to parse the input from Console.Readline() to integer and you’ll be good.
Lazy makes the *creation* of the object thread safe (and has other benefits, such as controlled timing vs static). But if the object's methods and properties aren't thread-safe, Lazy wouldn't help you with that. 
I checked out a few online, but none as compact and readable as this one. I was just doing a little bit of coding in JS and found this site and thought "Wow, it would have been great to have this when I first started with C#" I tend to stick with the same few parts of the language that I am familiar with. I use Generic Lists for 90% of my data structures. A cheat sheet might encourage me to look at other data structures, or use other parts of C#, but it would be nice to help newer devs who are coming over from Java. When I switched to C# from Java, I pretty much just wrote Java code and used Visual Studio's fantastic suggestions to make things work. A linq cheat sheet would be especially great because some of the MSDN doc parameters are so hard to read with all of the generic Typing and Enumerable parameters. I can use it (or the IDE) after I have a jumping off point. This one is ok: [https://www.dummies.com/programming/net/linq-for-dummies-cheat-sheet/](https://www.dummies.com/programming/net/linq-for-dummies-cheat-sheet/) &amp;#x200B; An analogy: I am a builder. I want to attach a board to something, so I usually reach for my hammer and nails. I figure there is probably a better way depending on what I am doing, but I just know my way will work ok. If I had a cheat sheet that said "Attaching boards" and showed a name and picture of a brad nailer and an Impact Driver with screws, I might think to use a more appropriate tool for the occasion. After I see a brad nailer a few times, and use it once, I wont ever break out the hammer to attach my crown molding again. I am at the point where I think I have heard of all the tools, but I sometimes worry that there is a better way. Or there is a tool that I haven't used in a while and i just want to check its parameters and see what its use looks like. That's what I love the most about the cheat sheet I linked to. It is super fast to use at a glance and more than enough to be a jumping off place for more research if necessary once you see what tool you need. 
If only we had something like an [AtomicInt](https://github.com/Egodystonic/Atomics/blob/master/Egodystonic.Atomics/Numerics/AtomicInt.cs)... (Coming soon!) haha
Agreed. That is a rather large oversight.
Well it is a kludge. In the project I ported to C# 8, I had to explicitly turn off nullable references for one file in order to get generics to work correctly. Still, I'd rather have a partial solution than continue having none at all. We just have to be really clear to others that just because you have a "non-nullable variable" doesn't mean you can omit things like parameter checks.
Unity3d is a major game engine and the scripting language is only C# now. In fact Unity joined the .NET Foundation.
Not necessarily, incrementing a shared variable isn't thread safe even when it's `volatile`.
Yea I’m sure there will be other material, it was just the only book needed for the class

More and more I agree with people like Joe Duffy and think that `volatile` should never have been included in the language; all it ever seems to do is give people a false sense of security.
What about debugging, profiling and 90 other tools that are built into VS?
You shouldnt assume OP to be using any particular IDE
Does anyone use something other than VS or VS code for C# development? 
I've never seen that around a literal before. I would use that syntax if I wanted to cast a variable as something else and gain access to its functions inline, like this: object phrase = "Hello world"; string[] words = ((string)phrase).Split(' '); 
you don't need to do that in csharp, you can just do: "Replace Me".Replace("Me","you");
Free? Yes, for $14/month it's free... (It's only free on Amazon Unlimited subscription).
Something like this? &amp;#x200B; string pairs = ["John@gmail.com](mailto:"John@gmail.com):test123"; int startIndex = pairs.IndexOf("@")+1; int endIndex = pairs.LastIndexOf(":") - startIndex; string allIndex = pairs.Substring(startIndex, endIndex); Console.WriteLine(allIndex);
This, my time is valuable and if I want to mentor there are actually programs with colleges I can work with that would help me connect with a larger network, get contacts within the school and generate good press for myself or my company. I like to help people but asking for mentor-ship for free completely discounts the amount of time the mentor needs to spend both with the subject and outside of one-on-one sessions to prep for the subject. It's seen as in a similar wheelhouse as people asking me to write an app for them for free or in exchange for dubious future benefits that are usually completely undefined.
VS Code, Rider, VS for Mac Personally: having used the VS/C# combo since '02, i know my way around VS, but prefer VS Code.

Sorry, I didn’t know that. Have amazon prime and I was able to download and read at my leisure for free
I don't know if it's a cheatsheet per se but I love the "Learn X in Y minutes" series for syntax reminders: https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/csharp/ 
VS code, monodevelop, vim, nano, emacs, sublime are the major ones i can think of
Hmm.. Don't know anything about Rider, but snippets are built into VS for Mac, and it looks like you need to manually add them to VS Code (but there's probably an extension for them) 
I never had one. But I worked with people who where far better than I am. Today, this is so much easier. Just join any C# opensource project on github, look for bugs you can fix, tests you can write and such things. After a while you can write code and then, someone will check your code and will give you pointers. Mentorship makes sense if you are in the same place, and then the mentor can show you something, like woodwork or welding. But with code this is complicated, because writing good one depends on so many things that fill easily 
Ok, so I'm kinda in a bad mood, and not really wanting to debate things, so I'm just going to ask that you read up on how C# handles: 1) Indexing into arrays. 2) Situations in which the JIT compiler can remove the automatic null check done when indexing into arrays. Because you were wrong four years ago.
I do not understand, are you getting that error in my code? It compiled and ran fine on my computer, so that would be weird.
Thanks for the info, I've never seen a reason not to use built in random number methods.
Debugging works fine in VS Code, though Visual Studio has better value inspectors and I'm not sure if there is a way to do conditional breakpoints in VS Code. I use PerfView for profiling, but I have occasionally used Visual Studio to quickly see garbage collection and memory usage over time when I don't feel like loading up PerfView. I guess I should have clarified that I use Visual Studio Code as my primary day-to-day editor for all of my .NET Core projects...I also use other tools as well when I feel the need.
Rider.
half of those are text editors
That [john@gmail.com](mailto:john@gmail.com):test123 is a example. It is a file called combo
Textbooks for Intro CS classes are basically just reference books anyway, is probs fine 
Do you realize the JIT compiler has nothing to do with the C# compiler?
yup, the c# extension brings in all the standard snippets. i suppose it boils down to "a collection of snippets for your language and editor of choice could be considered a form of cheat sheet" hehe.
Ohhhh interesting. 
Check your input string. I just tested this as well and it works perfectly fine. `string input = "[John@gmail.com](mailto:John@gmail.com):test123"; int atIndex = input.LastIndexOf('@') + 1; int colonIndex = input.LastIndexOf(':') - 1; int length = colonIndex - atIndex; string domain = input.Substring(atIndex, length);`
\&gt; Some of the employees in my workplace are questioning our processes, basically trying to fix what isn't broken. One of their "suggestions" is to implement version control. As of right now, our process is to keep a network folder with the latest working version of projects, then copy a project to our local drives if we need to make changes. I sincerely hope this is a joke. But if it isn't then yes, your processes are horribly broken if you are storing your source code on a network folder. Ever heard of that "Git" thing that people have been talking about for the past 15 years?
Well ok then I am expecting some of the values in the file does not have the char @ or : in it. With the information you are giving me, I would have to make the code somewhat more complicated to make sure it does not fail. So perhaps this will work: string pairs = "John@gmail.com:test123"; if(pairs.Contains('@') &amp;&amp; pairs.Contains(':')) { int startIndex = pairs.IndexOf("@") + 1; int endIndex = pairs.LastIndexOf(":") - startIndex; string allIndex = pairs.Substring(startIndex, endIndex); Console.WriteLine(allIndex); } &amp;#x200B;
It's a major undertaking to do this for a large application or service. You can start copying and pasting, but some things don't work in both so you're rewriting parts. Then there's changing the builds, undergoing full regression, updating tests, etc. For small stuff, it's many times not a big deal. Large enterprise services are a different story. Still not impossible obviously, and where there's a will (and resources), there can be a way.

We do, you have to call methods on the [Interlocked](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.interlocked?view=netframework-4.7.2) class to do atomic operations on numbers.
You are probably only getting results from one thread because of locks inherent locks in Console.WriteLine. The first thread to write locks the other threads, but because it finishes its lock just as it calls it again, it always wins the race to lock the Console again.
Spend some time browsing the Bootstrap page (https://getbootstrap.com/) An "accordion" might be what you're looking for
Maybe try to implement something like this? &amp;#x200B; [https://github.com/SuavePirate/DynamicWrapLayout](https://github.com/SuavePirate/DynamicWrapLayout)
So with accordion I can open and close existing elements but i dont want the elements that are closed to be visible on the page at all. I didn't see a show or hide option that would work with accordion animation and be able to compound one answer to show something or another answer to show something else. 
I can't speak for other people, but a lot of what I learned about Web development, I learned by stealing stuff from other sites. Find a site that does something cool, view source and figure out how they did it. There are lots of different hide/show techniques on the Bootstrap site; you might be able to find what you need. If all else fails you could submit the form each time and build the response page server-side but that would be pretty clunky and slow.
`Interlocked` and friends are more one of the fundamental building blocks of a proper Atomic library- as you can see in the linked code the Interlocked functions are being used a lot to build higher-level abstractions. Anyway I'm going to reveal more when the lib is ready for v0.1, which should be sometime later this year hopefully.

If you have a job or can get a job in the field, there are people who enjoy being mentors. I don’t think I’ve ever officially had or been one, but definitely unofficially on both sides. I’ve been in the field a long time and I enjoy spending my work hours sharing my knowledge and experience. You’ll be able to tell the type. Ask questions, some people will treat you like you’re a bother. Others will take an interest in your development. It’ll be difficult to find someone outside of work, but good employers will recognize the value of training less experienced devs and allow time for it. 
Cheat sheet? Really what the actual fuck do people need a cheat sheet for these days?
SIMD intrinsics? Is that that where the compiler automatically vectorizes loops where possible?
No, this lets you do the vectorization by hand. It is a half step between inline assembler and normal code. The .NET JIT will not currently do any auto-vectorization. The JVM can handle some very simple cases but only on integers, not floats/doubles. If you want to know more I did a talk on SIMD intrinsics recently: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Gs_CA_vm3o
I understand needing one for the shit that is JS because unless all your ts files are in order there is no autocomplete to be used for api discovery. But compiled languages generally don’t suffer this weakness. 
Here, I think I found a pretty good one online: https://i.imgur.com/G9scO3v.jpg
It's not an invalid question. But my question to you is: why haven't you just tried it?
Does it not have autocomplete?
You're right, I could just do that. I'm tired and it didn't occur to me that I could just slap this into a console program and see for myself.
Perhaps you're looking for a FlexLayout or Grid?

The empty constructor is called. And this just makes me more curious, but I can see why it is better to give the empty constructor priority - since this is what an end user would assume the third party code is doing. but it would be unwise to implement a class with built in ambiguity like this anyway. just don't do it.
(not OP)
&gt; Now that I know the answer, I'm just more curious - why? http://csharpindepth.com/Articles/General/Overloading.aspx Ctrl+F "Optional parameters"
awesome, thank you!
Isn't that was `System.Numerics.Vector&lt;T&gt;` is for?
System.Numerics.Vector&lt;T&gt; was an attempt to abstract over SIMD instruction sets, such that you could write portable code that would execute with optimum SIMD instructions on whatever CPU is encountered at runtime. It does provide a really convenient interface for the programmer, but unfortunately it only provides a tiny subset of available SIMD instructions. So you can't use it for too much.

Free (gated) Functional C# Cheat Sheet https://www.telerik.com/campaigns/devcraft/functional-programming-with-csharp-cheat-sheet
Ah, I'll have to look into that. Thanks!
Right, so does that mean they cant be used to write c# code? Dont get me wrong, i know most people (by far) use VS, but its not the only option
That's what I figured! Thanks for confirming my notions. Was hoping there'd be a magic library that would solve all this for me. Good news is the initial setup for this functionality will take work but once it's in it'll be set it and forget it.

Run time compile? &amp;#x200B; [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.codedom.compiler.codedomprovider?view=netframework-4.7.2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.codedom.compiler.codedomprovider?view=netframework-4.7.2)
You should stick to Roslyn, I have used it to run uncompiled C# source code file on the disk in an application and it works allright and you can use a very light method for what you need `object result = await CSharpScript.EvaluateAsync("1 + 2");` As with SQL, don't try to write your own parser for expressions. Entity Framework generates SQL from LINQ expressions, but not the other way around.
Some ahole would use this as an interview question.
Is security a concern? I.e. do the rules come from an untrusted source like users or too curious employees who might be trying to do stuff they shouldn't? Also, are the combining rules from 2. a separate category always evaluated after the rules from 1., or do you need to dynamically determine interdependencies to know which rules to evaluate first?
There are Expression trees, and they can be parsed from a string. I haven’t tried this, and don’t know if it suits your need, but it looks promising and easy enough: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/821365/how-to-convert-a-string-to-its-equivalent-linq-expression-tree#821616](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/821365/how-to-convert-a-string-to-its-equivalent-linq-expression-tree#821616) 
I would generate c# source files containing these rules and compile them with roslyn or compile them before your app starts for performance. this way you can literally create any rule you can think of.
people contribute to open source projects because they solve a problem of theirs or they use the program and need a feature. I dont think you can get any people on board with a project that has been done a million times. try something interesting, a tool, solve your own problems. then you will see people coming without you needing to recruit.
publish your project with starting docs so other people can dig in. 
To be clear, I don't think the maximum possible performance is necessarily better in C# (COM interop would be a terrible example of that, for one), but rather that a given level of compatibility + performance is easier to achieve
That sounds like it maps pretty directly onto [Expression Trees](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/expression-trees/) which you can compile to a lambda at runtime which you can then invoke.
I am quite sure VS has plugins for emoji support in comments. For those Z-gen programmers in the workforce
If its simple operators you can use Func&lt;T,TResult&gt; 
* If it is a `class`, it stores a reference to the object * If it is a `stuct`, it stores a copy of the value. This is a universal rule across all of C# and .NET. The only time there's an exception is when you are using the `ref` keyword. 
&gt; Your usage of Task.Run which attempts to wrap a synchronous implementation of an asynchronous operation for async consumers is a performance disaster for a library. Can you recommend a good approach? I don't want a bunch of duplicate code from maintaining sync and async versions of everything in the request workflow, so I was thinking of creating an async ExecuteRequestAsync method and have ExecuteRequest just call that with an await or whatever. But that article you cited suggests that this would also be a bad approach, but I wasn't really clear on what a *good* approach would be then. Any suggestions on that?
There is no way (without using `unsafe` pointers) to store long-lived references to structs in an object, because they could live on the stack and thus become invalid at any time. An easy workaround in your case might be to store the array index in the dictionary instead of the struct itself.
&gt; I would avoid the use of the name Controller. That name has been so thoroughly owned by MVC and WebAPI to mean "a class used to accept incoming requests" that your use of it here is incredibly confusing. I'm told that the ".NET" in the namespace particularly contributed to that. One of the changes I made was renaming the namespace from "Reddit.NET" to just "Reddit", so I believe that should mitigate most confusion. As for "ownership" of the term, I realize I'm likely in the minority view on this one, but I don't believe that's a valid reason to avoid using what is otherwise the most technically apt term for what these classes do. Terminology gets reused all the time and I've observed that people tend to overestimate any resulting confusion.
&gt; If the idea was to create a Reddit Bot Framework for console applications the your name should reflect that so you don't confuse people and you're probably on the right track. If you call a library Reddit.NET but it's really only good for building console bots that is incredibly misleading. RDN is a full API wrapper that is designed to make interfacing with the API as clean and easy as possible from an app dev's perspective. So it is more than just a 1:1 wrapper (though you can still get that by bypassing the controllers and calling the models directly), but only insomuch as it also does things like error-handling and monitoring. I believe it qualifies as an API library, though a person could make the argument that it's a bit bloated (see my reasons for that above).
 I use regex groups for this kind of parsing. It gives you a neater code, validation, testability, and no shithouse out of bounds checks everywhere. A good regex set will handle good bad and odball data better. There is a speed penalty for using a regex though 
So I need to make Hex a class if I want to pull the dictionary trick then, right?
This gets asked pretty often and there is extensive information available a google away. Also, I’m in mobile so I’ll let others answer, but if I were you I would have googled this yesterday :p.
I'm not asking for extensive information, rather, I'm trying to enquire if my understanding makes sense.
&gt; The problem here is that using _new_ for a struct doesn’t do anything It zeroes the struct out, or rather, every allocation of a struct or object does. &gt; and you can’t have parameterless constructors for them. Right, because they wouldn’t be called in many cases anyway, which would invite a lot of confusion. 
&gt; I tried to run all the tests but all of them failed Based on your description, my guess would be that you forgot to set the values in Reddit.NETTestsData.xml. I've since added code to have it give a more helpful error message in that event. &gt; The base README doesn't really contain any information that is pertinent to someone coming into this library. The README is usually one of the last things I tackle. Fortunately, somebody else updated it in a pull request and I merged it in. &gt; Ideally, this thing is built every commit to master I have to strongly disagree with you on this one. In fact, committing directly to master is generally seen as a bad practice in Git. I use the [Gitflow branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), which merges into master only for actual releases. &gt; then pushed to NuGet I'll be doing that with the 1.0.0 release. &gt; You actually have zero unit tests, but 327 integration tests. Yeah I did abuse the terminology a bit there. However, I do believe that everything in the "Unit Tests" playlist does qualify as a unit test if you regard each endpoint call as a unit. But yes "Integration Tests" is the correct overall term. I'll update the README to reflect this. &gt; if something happens to the reddit API during a time you want to test, you're kind of SOL on knowing if you broke something The API return data can easily be debugged, if need be. If the API were to go down, it'd be pretty obvious. There has already been one instance in which Reddit removed one of the API endpoints, causing a few of my tests to fail. I was able to determine exactly what the problem was without any difficulty. &gt; I'm not personally a fan of the way you modeled your models, specifically I think any method (including constructors) that take more than one parameter can be refactored to something more readable. It took a couple weeks, but I just finished refactoring the models based on your advice. I went with daedalus_structure's suggestion of going with strongly-typed configuration objects. &gt; awesome job completing a project enough to be able to show it off Thanks!
&gt; Wow you've put a lot of work in there :) Thanks! I removed the refs from the ctors.
I've renamed the namespace from "Reddit.NET" to just "Reddit", so that should alleviate most confusion. Thanks!
Async-await is a deceptive topic because it’s easy on the surface (and was designed exactly to be easy to use), but there are, in my opinion, too many situations where subtle details emerge, where you will benefit from a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms. I know how it works in great detail but I still have to double check from time to time, since it’s pretty complex in its implementation. It’s also difficult to explain in a Reddit post, which is why I suggested googling instead. 
Yep.
P.S. Another rule: A struct should be immutable (i.e. read-only). You should never be able to alter the properties of a struct. Any changes require completely replacing it. Exception: high performance scenarios that you are not ready for. (And to be honest, I've been using C# since v0.2 and I've only used mutable structs once.)
Everything in the struct is immutable except one variable which can only be altered once. Would this count as an acceptable exception? &amp;#x200B; Also, just out of curiosity, can you give an example of what you mean by a high performance scenario that I'm not ready for?
&gt; Would this count as an acceptable exception? No. That's even worse because it will appear to work correctly most of the time because &gt; Also, just out of curiosity, can you give an example of what you mean by a high performance scenario that I'm not ready for? Usually with things involving graphics programming. Here are some discussions on the topic. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8108920/why-is-it-okay-that-this-struct-is-mutable-when-are-mutable-structs-acceptable 
If you include an answer that’s suitable for most people then I don’t get your point. Sounds like you just want to let everyone know that you can code in a text editor
Its' also worth noting that for a class or method with a generic type parameter `T` having `where T: Foo, new()` constraints, the compiler will produce error if `Foo` does not have a empty constructor with no parameter (the constructor with optional parameter will not be used).
Move the curly brace so you're not disposing of the stream until after it's played IWaveProvider provider = null; using (SpeechSynthesizer synth = new SpeechSynthesizer()) using (MemoryStream stream = new MemoryStream()) { synth.SetOutputToAudioStream(stream, new SpeechAudioFormatInfo(44100, AudioBitsPerSample.Sixteen, AudioChannel.Mono)); synth.Speak("This is sample text-to-speech output."); stream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin); provider = new RawSourceWaveStream(stream, new WaveFormat(44100, 16, 1)); var waveOut = new WaveOut(); waveOut.Init(provider); waveOut.Play(); } Console.WriteLine(); Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit..."); Console.ReadKey(); &amp;#x200B;
Read the file line by line instead of File.ReadAllLines
1. \`File.ReadAllLines\` reads the entire file into memory. Use StreamReader instead to read the file if that is the place where it is slow. 2. What data type is \`combos\`? The \`combos.Contains\` call made for every line will get slower each time (e.g. it's not a constant time operation) if its not a hashtable/dictionary.
Free? It requires personal data
I find all of the Head First series to be overly childlike and obnoxious in their approach. They read like a high school maths book. A better, if not the best, option is Pro C# 7.0 With .Net and .Net Core by Andrew Troelson.
Use the built-in MailAddress class which handles parsing email addresses and has properties \`User\` and \`Host\` for the parts of the address before and after the at-sign.

Glad you found the answer to which one gets called. For the technical reasons, you can also have a look at the [C# specification's details on overloading](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/expressions#overload-resolution). 
Make combos into a HashSet, remove the contains check and just use Add.
Replace `File.ReadAllLines(...)` with `File.ReadLines(...)`
Note that if you use CSharpScript you should ideally cache the scripts because each evaluation generates a new assembly. Reusing the script lets you reuse the assembly as well.
and if you publish the solution/project don't forget to share it here
Use a database.
The problem is, for sure, not reading all lines from a text file in. This might only be a memory problem if the file is bigger (see `MemoryMappedFile`). I’ve recently optimized a library using different approaches, such as `DynamicMethod` with IL code [...]. Measuring the also used `File.ReadAllLines(string, Encoding)` resulted in &lt;0.5sec for 80MB. Of course this depends on your SSD/HDD or Network location etc. The real performance killer is what you do inside your loop. You will have to `optimize the shit out of it`. Think about ways it can be done better and faster. Measure time for smaller files and see how long it takes. Be also aware that some Linq operations can take a lot of time and can often be replaced with faster code. Avoid `foreach` where you can access by index to remove the enumerator overhead. Unfortunately you don’t provide all details, like the format of each line, to give the best possible answer. If you can, please include a full sample with 2-3 sample file-lines + code inside a `main` method. Measure the time of each operation and find your bottleneck. `Stopwatch` will help you a lot. Else you can always try performance profilers like dotTrace (trail version) or the inbuilt one of VS. - This was measured using VS2015 &amp; 2017 using the respective most recent version (C# 6 !)
It depends really. Do you need performance ? Check out `DynamicMethod` using IL code. Don’t care about perfomance ? Cast it to dynamic.
Tried implementing this, but it does not show my data. &amp;#x200B; [https://github.com/RudiHansen/TestXamarin.Forms/blob/master/TestXamarin.Forms/TestXamarin.Forms/Views/ItemsPage.xaml](https://github.com/RudiHansen/TestXamarin.Forms/blob/master/TestXamarin.Forms/TestXamarin.Forms/Views/ItemsPage.xaml)
&gt;FlexLayout I my original code i was using a ListView, to show my Tasks from the list of Tasks i have. But FlexLayout does not seem to have that functionality that ListView has to bind to a list, am i simply not finding that, or am i misunderstanding something?
Are more performant version would 1. use async, 2. read line-by-line, 3. use data structure which supports efficient lookups. &amp;#8203; HashSet&lt;string&gt; combos = new HashSet&lt;string&gt;(); if (!Directory.Exists("./Combos") || Directory.GetFiles("./Combos").Length &lt;= 0) { WriteLine("Please add some combos to combos directory!"); Directory.CreateDirectory("./Combos"); Console.ReadLine(); Environment.Exit(0); } foreach (var file in Directory.GetFiles("./Combos", "*.txt")) { var sr = new StreamReader(file); foreach (var line in await sr.ReadLineAsync()) if (line.Contains(':') &amp;&amp; !combos.Contains(line)) combos.Add(line); } &amp;#x200B;
This would be accomplished client side with JavaScript. You could use something like jQuery UI’s animation library to slide your elements left or right out of the viewport and slide the new ones in.
C-like languages with good standard libraries don't suffer from this problem. Every time I've tried wrapping my head around some language with a wildly different syntax a cheat sheet was almost required. Go look at some F# code and tell me if it's at all intuitive for someone who mainly works with c-like.
Is this also true when struct is a field of a class? I thought such struct is guaranteed to live on the heap.
Ok I think my description of what I am trying to do here was bad. I have a list of tasks I am showing in a ListView, and right now the items in my ItemTemplate is shown like in Eks1 in the picture. And I would like them to look like in Eks2, so with a border around them and the items has to be stacked horizontally instead of vertically. Any tips on how I can achieve this? &amp;#x200B;
What's your question? As for turning requirements into code, it's important to list and express all your requirements well. Forget the code for a minute and just work through how the system should behave (explicitly, in detail) for different inputs in different situations. Once you fully understand that the coding gets much easier.
Check out http://cht.sh by Igor Chubin I just discovered it and have been using it like crazy. Super useful
There's a difference between writing code and developing solutions
I like this as both a VB.Net and C# cheatsheet. [VB.Net to C# comparison](https://www.harding.edu/fmccown/vbnet_csharp_comparison.html) There is also a Java to C# sheet, but I use very little Java and have never used it. 
I honestly have no idea what your question is. And now I understand why stackoverflow closes 50% of their questions (made up stat)

me no entiendo your question
How complex are your expressions? Roslyn is great (we use it massively) but a simple parser might be enough
Far more useful than a book for learning C# for a visual learner: [https://www.linqpad.net/](https://www.linqpad.net/) Not that a book isn't useful, of course. But I'd get this app first, no question. This is the one software purchase I have zero regrets about. There are some free options that are similar. RoslynPad is pretty good, for instance. But LinqPad *is* better.
Here is a working example of your code, no error checking. using System; namespace Taak { class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { Random willekeurig = new Random(); int[] array1 = new int[4]; int[] array2 = new int[4]; int[] correctSumS = new int[4]; //int[] mySums = new int[4]; int[] answers = new int[4]; Random random = new Random(); for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) { // if (uitkomsten &lt; 4) ; array1[i] = random.Next(-100, 100); array2[i] = random.Next(-100, 100); Console.WriteLine("Give the sum of " + array1[i] + " + " + array2[i]); correctSumS[i] = array1[i] + array2[i]; Int32.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out answers[i]); if (correctSumS[i] == answers[i]) Console.WriteLine("Answer is correct"); else Console.WriteLine("Answer is wrong! Sould be = " + correctSumS[i]); } Console.WriteLine("Finished!"); Console.ReadLine(); } } }
&gt;I don't believe that's a valid reason to avoid using what is otherwise the most technically apt term for what these classes do. I think that's a huge reach but I suppose everyone has a right to their opinion. But I'm still making that point that I don't think you understand when developing a library for public use it is not about your preferences. Code is read an order of magnitude or three more than it is written and any confusion you sow by poor naming because you can't possibly imagine another name for a coordinating, managing, servicing, or dispatching class is a little slap in the face to everyone who has to double take on it. By the way, there are some hints in that last paragraph. 
Implement the async path first and return an `async Task` or `async Task&lt;TResult&gt;` as a rule and wire that all the way down through the HttpClient. This is a library built to facilitate IO and shouldn't be holding on to threads while waiting on the network. Simply providing the interface that appears to be async but still ties up an additional thread under the hood is not only bad programming it's deceptive. In order of descending maintainability and good design. 1. Provide async only and let the consumer figure it out if they want to force synchronous calls. 2. Provide async with synchronous stubs that call the async methods and resolve the Tasks. 3. Provide two independent code paths. 4. Provide sync with async wrappers. 
It's not a bit bloated, it's incredibly bloated. You decided to handle concerns that consumers of your library should handle. You did so in the way you would handle them for your consuming architecture in the very narrow scope of your own use case. Ah, a .NET library. I should be able to use this in a web application yeah? Nope, thrashes the living shit out of the thread pool, claims to have an async interface but is synchronous under the hood, and all the event handlers can't fire in any meaningful context. Azure Function to automate my social media in a custom "If this then that" way? Nope, same reasons. Ah, the author meant "A fully featured Reddit API library if I have the extremely narrow use case of building a program I can run on my own machine because that was his itch and he couldn't possibly conceive of any other use, else, keep looking". I mean, nothing stopping you, but this really isn't how you get taken seriously as a library author. 
God, I hope not. That isn't a very good cheat sheet. It's going to have you writing technically functional code with horrific architecture. None of the actual *important* concepts are covered there. Loops and selectors and script tags are easy. They're like learning the alphabet. But a person who has learned the alphabet cannot thereby write a book. Don't ever use a cheat sheet when programming. Learn the underlying concepts that distinguish elegant solutions from oh-god-please-kill-me-now-why-did-I-ever-decide-to-write-programs-for-a-living. If you're too lazy to do that, you're too lazy to write software.
Contains is probably fast but you might as well just add it it cause in contrary to a Dictionary you can add the same “key” twice with a HashSet.
Yes, security is a concern as these rules would be coming from users. There will probably be an interface for creating them, but for now it’s simply manual database entries. The rules from 2 will always be evaluated after 1. No need for determining any interdependencies.
The expressions can be arbitrarily complex in length, but only basic logical operators are valid, so I’d really only need to worry about AND, OR, NOT, and grouping with parentheses.
Nowadays, VS doesn't bring anything special to the table. I've used VS, VS for Mac and VS Code with equal success.
The operators are simple but the expressions can contain any number of operations. So what I’m struggling with is taking a string, such as “Rule1 &amp;&amp; (Rule2 || Rule3) &amp;&amp; !Rule4” and turning that into an expression I can evaluate given the results of each Rule (true or false).
This was my hell last week
I mostly agree, as that is exactly what I am using for part 1 of the problem. My struggle comes when trying to use them for more complex strings than just “X + Y”, or something, because I have an arbitrary number of values to pass in to the expression so I can’t really use something like Func&lt;int, int&gt;. 
You might find a library than can help you with interpretation but I haven't looked at this in ages. A rules engine may be what you want to look at but they can be overkill. Funcs can return bools (the base Func&lt;T&gt; does that).Whatever you use you are going to need to break down your written formula following an order of operations and feeding it into a series of small processing methods (funcs, delegates, whatever). Really your complexity at this point is how freeform your user is allowed to be with syntax. 
a simple parser should be enough then, something like [that](https://medium.com/@CantabileApp/writing-a-simple-math-expression-engine-in-c-d414de18d4ce)
Would you mind expanding on this? How can I create C# source files of these rules if I do not know the values of the parameters at compile-time? I know what you’re saying is valid, I just have a disconnect in knowledge when it comes to turning these rules into actual C# code. I think that’s why I’m struggling to understand how to make use of Roslyn here since the rules don’t really make sense to me as “code” per se.
That's due to the way how optional parameters are implemented. The parameter will be present, it will be required, but the compiler just automatically inserts the default value on the calling site.
In what form you are saving these rules ? Can you express them in csharp like you would write an if statement ? 
I'm procrastinating before getting in to my normal Saturday tasks so I took a few minutes to benchmark the various suggestions in the thread. Using a StreamReader synchronously is the fastest method: ReadAllLines completed in 8002 ms ReadLine completed in 5698 ms StreamReader completed in 3950 ms StreamReaderAsync completed in 180367 ms Using StreamReader asynchronously uses quite a bit of CPU in addition to taking much longer, speculatively due to thread pool pressure. using System; using System.Diagnostics; using System.IO; using System.Threading.Tasks; namespace ConsoleApp7 { class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { var sw = new Stopwatch(); Run(sw, ReadAllLines); Console.WriteLine($"ReadAllLines completed in {sw.ElapsedMilliseconds} ms"); Run(sw, ReadLine); Console.WriteLine($"ReadLine completed in {sw.ElapsedMilliseconds} ms"); Run(sw, StreamReader); Console.WriteLine($"StreamReader completed in {sw.ElapsedMilliseconds} ms"); Run(sw, StreamReaderAsync); Console.WriteLine($"StreamReaderAsync completed in {sw.ElapsedMilliseconds} ms"); Console.ReadKey(); } static void Run(Stopwatch sw, Action action) { sw.Reset(); sw.Start(); action(); sw.Stop(); GC.Collect(); } static void ReadAllLines() { var lines = File.ReadAllLines("file.csv"); foreach (var line in lines) { } } static void ReadLine() { foreach (var line in File.ReadLines("file.csv")) { } } static void StreamReader() { using (var reader = new StreamReader("file.csv")) { while (!reader.EndOfStream) { reader.ReadLine(); } } } static void StreamReaderAsync() { Task.Run(async () =&gt; { using (var reader = new StreamReader("file.csv")) { while (!reader.EndOfStream) { await reader.ReadLineAsync(); } } }).GetAwaiter().GetResult(); } } } 
Yes, but when they are stored they wouldn’t exactly make sense or compile because there are no raw values. They are basically tokens or placeholders which would eventually be replaced by actual Booleans. For example a rule is stored as “Rule1 &amp;&amp; Rule2”, and at runtime I have determined the result of Rule1 (true) and Rule2 (false) so I can say that the expression is “true &amp;&amp; false” which evaluates to false.
Additionally this code will only iterate over the characters of the first line in the file.
Intellisense pretty much has this covered, I'd have thought.
But I guess not for stuff like if/else statements - but you shouldn't really need a cheat sheet for that.
You'll probably save a good deal of time using a library to do some of the heavy lifting. I've used https://github.com/pvginkel/Expressions for years.
If it matters to anyone, the input file is roughly 1gb and contains about 1.2 million lines.
If you create an interface and put a method in it such as evaluate you could make pretty complicated conditions or even extra code by implememting that interface and registering the implememtation in a IoC (unity or autofac) you could evaluate any rule you want. You just have to call the interface with values. 
No such thing as a silly question. Just need to know what functionality the framework provides. You can use Math.Abs to ensure a number is positive. You can see an example [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.math.abs?view=netframework-4.7.2) 
If you are expecting a 100 on the second instance I'm assuming that you want to make negative numbers positive. In that case, could you use Math.Abs() to make sure the variables aren't negative?
300 is the correct answer. 200 - -100 is 300. 
I never understood why they don't just spit out an error that clearly explains what's expected and what's wrong.
In math, subtracting a negative is effectively the same thing as adding the positive... `200 - (-100) == 200 + 100 == 300` This isn't C# specific... it's just math.
Amazing how people blindly follow the crowd and upvote comments like this. Who are you to speak on behalf anyone one reddit except yourself? People contribute to open source projects for any number of reasons. Perhaps they are bored. Want to meet other people. Want to learn something new. So what if CRM has been done a million times. Are you saying the world is out of fresh ideas? Should we all just stop because everything that can be done has been done? I don't think so. Congrats to OP for posting this I hope you meet up with some great people.
Don’t ask to ask! Not sure what your q is. 200 - (-100) is 300. Basic math. Has nothing to do with C#. 
Because the site that is having the problem likely doesn’t have enough information to print an informative error. At this point it is open source so you can go try and find what is emitting the error and submit a PR to make it more informative. 
Ahh right... Use the Math.Abs.. Thank you.
Yes, but my underlying question is more about how I deal with this. You see the values 200 &amp; 100 are monetary values that will be entered by user and in some instances will be minus... Another commenter has suggested I use Math.Abs to ensure the numbers are always positive to stop me getting the wrong answer (in my case)
Not talking about website errors, he's specifically referring to binding redirect errors when compiling .NET (and not even core - he's talking about .NET Framework which isn't open source). Binding redirect errors have been a plague for a long time. There are ways to debug it, but the easiest would be to just spit out exactly where the code searched for the assembly and what it found and what it was expecting.
Yes, I understand. But my underlying question was more about asking how I deal with this. You see my example values of 200 &amp; -100 are monetary values that will be entered by user and in some instances will be minus... People are suggesting I use Math.Abs to ensure the numbers are always positive to stop me getting the wrong answer (in my case)
Nevermind, I figured it out, this line if (Regex.IsMatch(symbol, @"@\/")) Should be if (Regex.IsMatch(symbol, "[@/]")) Everything works now 
I've never experienced this problem. Can someone explain the scenario to me?
&gt;you use Math.Abs() Thanks for the advice. 
It's quite possible that I'm misunderstanding (and correct me if I am) but it sounds like that would be a good solution for how to evaluate Rule1 and Rule2 in my above example. However, by the time I make it to "Rule1 &amp;&amp; Rule2", I have actually already evaluated Rule1 and Rule2 and I have their results. Without any code it's tough to explain what I'm trying to do in a concrete way, so I'm working on a simple example application that illustrates what I'm trying to do.
A gist or github repo would suffice
var val2 = Math.Abs(-100)
The result is the same in money terms to. For example subtracting from an account is a debit. If you debit -$100, you are crediting $100 and it's $300. You can use Math.Abs to get the result you want, but the result you *want* is not the *correct* one, as far as I can see.
Is this common? I am pretty new to asp.net and have only used core so far. 
Wrong..... overriding equals and gethashcode with what you use to identify a unique object will prevent duplicates in a hashset. A string uses it's characters as the identifier...only 1 unique string will go into the hashset.
I might butcher this but... Say your project uses framework A. You want to bring in some tools that are targeted to different frameworks (lets say B, C, D ..., etc). Essentially, when you build, msbuild gets confused on which framework to use because you might have the same symbols that are targeted in multiple frameworks. So you have to redirect those symbols to the \_preferred\_ framework. And for some damn reason, that doesn't fix the problem. 
I think the point is that you can invoke `Add()` multiple times with the same value and it will result in exactly one value in the resulting set. OP's post is poorly worded but they understand how HashSet works.
Yeah you're right. &lt;3 you OP
Exactly, you can’t have dupes in a HashSet. However, the add method does not crash if you add an object with same hash code twice.
So I have just been googling around and found [this guy on the msdn forums](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/a9c39e69-79c4-4807-b5f8-7bdf820fc9c3/addingsubtractingmultiplying-positive-and-negative-numbers?forum=csharpgeneral) asking a similar question where he was having issue with negative numbers. The advice there is as follows (basically wrapping Math.Abs with the negative number): "To add two numbers A and B 1) If B is positive and B is positive, result is A+B 2) If A is positive and B is negative, result is A-|B| 3) If A is negative and B is positive, result is B-|A| 4) If A is negative and B is negative, result is -(|A|+|B|)" I then found this [algebra class link on subtracting integers](http://www.algebra-class.com/subtracting-integers.html) which talks about changing the subtraction to an addition which works for me.. So I think I have my answer. Thanks everyone! &amp;#x200B;
There is no easy way. The script code doesn't use solutions. However, its somewhat trivial to iterate through the syntax tree using a tree walker and check each node for a reference to a symbol.
\[Net Framework Is Open Source\]([https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet))
Yuuuuup. The hours lost reading dumps from [fuselogw.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/fuslogvw-exe-assembly-binding-log-viewer) are ones I wish I could get back. Bonus points for those times where you enable automatic binding redirects and generate them but they aren't obeyed anyway for one reason or another.
If it is in a field, then it lives inside the class. If it is "boxed" (stored in a variable of type System.Object), then it can go on the heap directly, but you can't do anything with it until you unbox it. It can also be put structs directly into an array. *** * Classes go in the heap, always. * Structs go... well it's complicated
Damn. That’s what I thought, but thanks for confirming. Walking the syntax tree does work, to a point... but when I find a token “Parse” on the syntax tree, for example, I don’t believe there’s an easy way to know if it’s a property (correctly capitalised, albeit a poor name), a field/variable (incorrectly capitalised), or a call to int.Parse. But if that’s all I’ve got, I will deal with it.

tnx man, I will try :))
fuck I didn't totally translate this, so willekeurig means random, because it has to give 4 random questions and uitkomst means Random
So the issue here is you want to confirm that a user's input is a positive number. I am kind of confused why other commentators are not understanding this. So maybe what you are trying to do is withdraw/deposit money? You should not use Math.Abs. Instead, if a user inputs a negative number you should prompt the user to enter a positive number. I am assuming you are just learning and using WinForms for this? Here is something you could try: when the user clicks the button you check if their input is a positive number. If the input is a negative number do not process their transaction. You could also try making the input text box turn red or display a label that tells the user they must enter a positive integer.

You are getting the exception as you are trying to access the item at index 7 in the rightSums array which only contains items at positions 0,1,2 and 3. What is the significance of 7? Should this just be switched out to be i?
yes it should be I, I changed it now, but I see sometimes it says + and -, wich only should be + or - and when I put the wrong asnwer, it should be given the wrong answers when all the questions has been answered , tnx man btw

Declare the string outside of the initial method. 
I am not familiar with C# so don't know the syntax but generally, you can achieve this in 2 ways &amp;#x200B; 1. declare `charactername` outside of your methods i.e., class level variable (probably they are called properties in C#). By doing so it will be visible to all methods in your class. 2. OR, pass the variable to your method i.e., `yourothermethod(charactername)`. and `yourothermethod` will be declared to accept a string. 
[Here it is](https://github.com/Lyelt/ExpressionExample). Feel free to let me know if you think I'm going about it in totally the wrong way (even the parts that I have "figured out"). Hopefully my intentions are mostly clear based on the code, but let me know if I can clarify anything.
I updated the post with an example application of what I am trying to do. Hopefully it'll clear things up.
I updated the post with an example application of what I am trying to do. Hopefully it'll clear things up. 
Oh man, this was easier than i expected. Thank you. 
Both of your methods worked, thank you. 
Thanks for your feedback! I updated the post with an example application of what I am trying to do. As for complexity, I think the syntax can be fairly strict since in the end there will probably be a UI for creating the expressions and the user won't have to write the syntax at all.
Thanks for your feedback. I'll look into that!
No, this is the wrong way to do it. The idiomatic way to do this in C# is to create an interface that defines the functionality you want to provide, and then implement drivers for each backend.
Yes until you have two dependencies to different packages that both have a dependency to the same package but different versions. Hell starts 😉
I use VS Code for small to medium sized projects and... I use a more terse language for that
&gt; You can use Math.Abs to get the result you want, but the result you want is not the correct one, as far as I can see. This depends on the requirements. If it's user input that is defines val_1 and val_2 then it could as well be the correct way to process the input
I thought that might be the case. Do you have a good resource to walk me through interfaces that are resource selective? 
That will leave you writing imperative code in F# when functional code would have been far more appropriate. The issue with cheat sheets is that they don't communicate the semantics of the language to the intuition of the programmer. They only communicate the syntax and in which case you are better off just reading the grammar from the specification.
&gt; .NET Framework is not taking contributions from the community which doesn't really meet the definition of open source What? That's not at all what OSS means. The key of Open Source is your ability to *modify* and *redistribute*. In short, there is no language that says you must accept contributions, but if you think your contribution is worthwhile you are free to fork the code and distribute your own with your changes (and any other contributions you wish to accept). https://opensource.org/osd-annotated You're right about the full framework, though. afaik the reference source is only available under [MS-RSL](https://referencesource.microsoft.com/license.html) which is not an OSS-approved license.
No problem! Everyone starts somewhere. 
And 2.2 isn't backward compatible with the last minor version? That makes it sound like the versioning system is not following semver.
Factory pattern.
Yes I am using Winforms for this. That's also a good idea. I will look into this to add some checking to the text boxes. I also need to double check if entering a negative number is something that can entered Thanks for this.
I wrote comments on github
Thank you. Sorry for my ignorance but where can I find them?
Your second commit
 * Rule 1: No job postings (For Hire and Hiring) 
i'd recommend against passing null. re-architect your view/controller to pass a model with default/empty values and handle it accordingly.
I'm having a little bit of a conceptual problem understanding how this would work. Does the following make sense or is this going to fail horribly? &amp;#x200B; interface IFunctions() { int Evaluate() } class CudaFunction():IFunction { { int Evaluate() { //Cuda Stuff } } class CudaFunction():IFunction { { int Evaluate() { //Cuda Stuff unsafe without a Cuda device } } class x86Function():IFunction { { int Evaluate() { //Safe stuff } } void main() { IFunction func; if (cuda) func = new CudaFunction(); else func = new x86Function() func.evaluate() } &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Your Reactive U?I link doesn't work, so I'll give a vanilla INotifyPropertyChanged example. &amp;#x200B; You need to subscribe to the Property Changed Event Handler of your instantiated BitMap class. Assuming this is in an Android Activity, you subscribe and unsubscribe in the OnResume and OnPause methods. Below is the minimum you'd need to do that. &amp;#x200B; private MyBitmap bitObj; protected override void OnCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { base.OnCreate(savedInstanceState); bitObj = new MyBitmap(); } protected override void OnResume() { base.OnResume(); bitObj.PropertyChanged += Bitmap_PropertyChanged; } protected override void OnPause() { base.OnPause(); bitObj.PropertyChanged -= Bitmap_PropertyChanged; } void Bitmap_PropertyChanged(object sender, PropertyChangedEventArgs e) { switch (e.PropertyName) { case nameof(MyBitmap.Name): { textView.Text = bitmap.Name; break; } } }
Yeah that's pretty much what you need to do.
did you even read the image??
Yea. I’ll have proper class separation I just put the main in so you could see how I was thinking of calling the work. 
Forget RestSharp. The library was written at my company by the developer I replaced 10 years ago. That person left programming entirely to get into "developer evangelism" instead. I can recommend [Flurl](https://flurl.io/), however. It was also written by a developer at my company. Yeah, we make a shit ton of HTTP calls.
there is another way, the functional way, but it is not idiomatic. 
Thanks very much! I will try using Flurl instead. Would I need to use something like Newtonsoft.Json to deserialize?
I am not sure FlexLayout or Grid help me here, my items from my list are in a ListView, witch is the only thing i found so far that can contain multiple items from a list with data binding.
This may be able to solve my problem but not quite sure yet, and also it seems to be missing some features like some way of reacting to when you select an item in the List.
Thanks
.NET Core doesn't have binding redirects. All binding is handled automatically by the compiler without user intervention.
So then take the content of the DynamicWrapLayout.cs and add you own touch event handler for the children items. 
You could try adding a custom compiler step where you transpile emojis into ACII variable names.
Thank you for sharing
Many applications are using classes that were deprecated in .NET 4. I know because MS is porting them to Core 3.0 in order up make migration easier. 
Flurl uses Newtonsoft.Json by default for serializing and deserializing json. You don't need to reference Newtonsoft.Json directly unless you need to customize the serializer settings or add Newtonsoft attributes to your class definitions. You can also provide your own serializer to Flurl by implementing the `ISerializer` interface. I personally use [Utf8Json](https://github.com/neuecc/Utf8Json) for most things, *especially* HTTP requests where I'm sending and receiving UTF8 bytes.
&gt;await sr.ReadLineAsync()) You're right of course, thanks for spotting it. I was too hasty, I guess.
Huh... now my faith in async is really rattled. 🤔
This is amazing.
It's definitely worth considering migrating your project to the new csproj format and using &lt;PackageReference&gt; it is a lot better at resolving dependencies and really seems to cut down how much this happens.
Guys, this is not spam. The comic is relevant to c# and was made with quality.
Nuget dependency resolution is also hell. It just takes the lowest possible version. So nobody gets security patches. Except for (asp).net core runtime, those packages can be rolled forward.
I just was replying because I saw your comment and it seemed like you thought people were offended or something about you talking negatively. Honestly, to me it just reminded me of a guy at work we called "Moany Mike", who wasn't offensive, but was a bit of an emotional vacuum cleaner.
Is there any way to work around this? Do you know of any other language that handles it in a better way?
My cursor used be a normal blinking line now it is a box 
Try pressing your insert key. If that doesn't work, a hammer will.
Ok it works thanks and lol
It doesn't happen in NET Core that's why, only the old Windows Framework
For wider context you can flip to insert mode typing into any program, and the characters you enter will delete the existing character at that location. On some keyboards the button is easy to mash and whenever I do it it takes a bit to figure out even though I know what’s going on lol
Context switching has a non zero cost. There are going to be cases where this cost outweighs the cost of doing the operation synchronously.
Looks like you want a FlexLayout: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/layouts/flex-layout](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/layouts/flex-layout) This is based on the CSS Flex display mode. This would however not allow you to use a ListView, rather you would make a custom listview of sorts with a FlexLayout.
For each of your items, you need to use a frame if you need corner radius and an outline. To stack your items horizontally, I'm not sure if listview is the best option for you. You can try creating a template with two items and use it in a listview, but you won't be able to use list properties like ItemTapped or ItemSelected to identify your tapped item. You can however, use listviews in your layout and simply divide your items into two collections. If you won't have a ton of items, you can create this view with Stacklayout, Flexlayout or Grid with Frame as an item template.
The asyncs will be refactored. And you can just use the model layer directly if you don't want the extra features introduced by the controllers to muck things up. Do you believe the same problems with web apps would still occur if you called the models directly?
 public static string GetTheName() { return the name; } public static void UseTheName(string name) { //use the name; } public static void Main(string[] args) { UseTheName(GetTheName()); } 'functional' approach just for fun &amp;#x200B;

Also, the version on powershell/wmf framework matters a lot for calling powershell. Your .net target version of the application matters for this greatly.
Having said that, you should be able to do the same with C# natively. PowerShell is very hung up on restrictions on your domain network and not too simple to deploy to a machine even when packaged into an executable. (Not supported with PS version below 3.0.)

This helps me get part way through the issue. Thanks! What happens is this (I think): Several nuget packages are missing on the hard drive VS attempts to redownload them at compile time, encounters China timeout issues I manually download the packages it struggles with for UWP, clear caches, clean solutions, point to the new local files, everything is 👌👌 Attempt to use Xamarin.Forms for new project, which has more serious missing package issues than UWP I change nuget back to download/point it to a different directory, doesn’t help I switch back to UWP project, even though VS knows how to get to the correct directory still, it wants to go back to attempting downloads again, fails, clutters things up I’m back at square 1 and have to clean everything up again Xamarin problems still unsolved. I suspect I will have to proactively identify and manually download the missing packages. I wish that the official Nuget API utilized by VS didn’t time out so dang fast! That would rid me of this problem! Surely the .NET folks know that some people have low bandwidth, work behind firewalls, use VPNs, &amp;c&amp;c.
Thanks! That worked, but now I'm stuck on another problem. I changed the code so that I could enter my own text but now if I for example enter ABC, let the program speak, and then enter CBA it says both ABC *and* CBA. [Here's my code](https://ptpb.pw/ilyS/csharp)

It takes the version that is installed and the the version it the package dependency. With packagereference you can just install a later version in your app and it will use that. Automatically taking a higher version than specified in the dependency sounds dangerous / worse than what we have now. Nuget really isn't as bad as people here make it out to be. It's pretty solid and recent updates fix a lot of the pain points mentioned here

It's interesting that this is the most common design pattern. I personally can't even remember the last time I needed to use something like this. I suppose it's far more common when you work with code you don't own (can't change).
Use TabControl &amp;#x200B; tabControl1.SelectedPage = tabpage1;
Yeah... I was going to say something similar, personally I use the Repository pattern at least 10000x more often.
I'm assuming this speaks to GoF patterns specifically. But yeah I would think something like a Facade, factory, or singleton is far more common.
I would have liked this 20 years ago. Minus the exaggeration on the frequency it's used. This is purely OOP. I moved from OOP to the Functional-esque world (SOP) in 2007, and many many others before and after me have dropped OOP completely or mostly for more functional leaning paradigms. So this article really is a huge over exaggeration and pulling death from the graveyard. Had it not been for the exaggerated title, I wouldn't have said anything. But it sparked my need to add my opinion and observation.
I've used the Surface Pro and the Surface Laptop, and I would recommend either. Each one had i5/8G/256G and has been more than adequate to run Visual Studio. The Surface laptop is better for using on your lap, as the kickstand gets kind of wonky in your lap, but performance wise, I can't recommend enough.
I have a dell inspiron, I think 15 3000 or something and it runs unity and visual studio fine. It has a touchscreen, backlit keyboard and weighs nothing. Definitely recommend. 
If youre doing it with EF, please stop.
&gt;15 3000 This one?

Thank you so much for your comment :) 
Thank you but i meant so instead of the console being selected the notepad will, so i can type in it(sendkeys).
Been an sharp programmer for 15 years and have never had this issue.
Personally, I would look into the logstash, elasticsearch, and kibana stack. I have used this stack for systems that have intermittent connectivity, and in some cases that connectivity can be months between. Yes there is a way to do it, it really all comes down to implementation. However all of them are going to require some networking configuration. One way would be to set up a REST endpoint on the server that the client can interface with. This way has a lot of the networking communication already pre-baked in along with handy security measures. You could also roll your own using a TcpListener/Endpoint, but you will need to handle all the serialization, reconnects, security, etc yourself.

It’s spelled “help”, actually. Also affects (not effects).
How do you isolate your code from a dependency in a functional manner?
I’m not sure, I think it might be this, but mine has pentium gold. I’ll take a picture when i get home: https://www.pcworld.co.uk/gbuk/computing/laptops/laptops/dell-inspiron-15-5000-15-6-intel-core-i3-laptop-1-tb-hdd-silver-10182139-pdt.html?intcmpid=display~RR
lol yeah... i wanted to try something really strange basically when the program is running it switches over to minecraft and types any command in the chat... &amp;#x200B; i also realized another problem to do sendkeys {ENTER} doesn't work in minecraft for some reason... i only use the hacks on myself or to prank my brother . . . xD
Ahh perfect thanks, so it runs fine on a Pentium and 4gb of ram? interesting! 
Well mine is new, so we’ll see if it slows down lol
haha indeed! are you an developer? :) 
What if you need to remove the entity framework dependency from your presentation layer? There is sometimes a reason to use repository pattern with ef.
I currently only do it in my spare time for fun but I want to become professional one day :)
Why is that?
EF already implements this pattern and repository is just thin useless layer of abstraction... Let the dbcontext out its not like you will switch ORM's in one night (or ever). Lots of articles about it. I especcially cringe when I see repository with methods like findById, findByName, getXxxFromYyy... Used in one place.
Yes. 100%. I see this so much and I just cringe. 
Yes you can. You can get the SymbolInfo for the parent expression to the token. Then you can determine if it’s a property, field or method symbol. If all you want to find are methods you can just only look at the invocation expressions.
Then there is really not much purpose in using EF in the first place. By wrapping EF in a repository pattern you lose nearly all benefits that EF brings to the table.
Fair point, at the stage where you are implementing you can just use whatever method your team is most comfortable with
Developing in dotnet core with VSCode works quite well.
Mono is old news, you’d use .NET Core for cross platform development nowadays.
