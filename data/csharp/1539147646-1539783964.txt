Come up with a small project: Say, calculate your bank account if you start with some amount of money, and then add some amount of money, and make a particular interest rate for x number of years. Break it down into small pieces, as small as you can possibly make it, and then look up how to do each of those pieces. It will take a little while, but you'll learn. 
If you think lambda and linq is hard, get into real async programming, dependency injection (ioc), an ORM or do Q#. Spoiler: you can easily learn all of them, there is no increased difficulty if you have enough experience in learning new tech. 
What helped me, way back in the day was the O'Reilly book. [https://www.amazon.com/C-7-0-Nutshell-Definitive-Reference/dp/1491987650/ref=sr\_1\_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1539150580&amp;sr=8-4](https://www.amazon.com/C-7-0-Nutshell-Definitive-Reference/dp/1491987650/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1539150580&amp;sr=8-4) &amp;#x200B; Had to learn C# for work so of course I took tutorials, downloaded some stuff and tinkered around, but I had no idea what I was doing. Started reading the O'Reilly book on my lunch breaks and making up exercise for myself. Took me months, but I learned a ton. Within those few months I already figured out tons of way to save myself time and frustration. Another good idea is taking the C# Role Track at Pluralsight. [https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/csharp](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/csharp) I'm about halfway through it now, and I've learned quite a bit. I've been a C# dev for years. Really gets into all the nook and crannies of the language. &amp;#x200B;
Yea maybe hitbox was a bad word to describe it - hit-test would've been better.
You're welcome. I know how hard it is to wrap your head around recursion the first time.
Golf mode: public int SmallerDollsCount =&gt; containedDoll == null ? 0 : 1 + containedDoll.SmallerDollsCount; `int SmallerDollsCount =&gt;` This is a get-only property with a single line that returns a value. `x ? y : z` If (x) then y else z 
Oh that’s great, really helpful thanks.
I’ll give it a try, thank you!
Technically not. You can’t script in mono. Mono is an open source version of the .Net Framework, whereas C# is a language,
Well yes, but the language is the important thing here.
I know you didn't ask for an advice but I don't think making an application to demo just one day before the interview is a good idea. It will surely be trivial, having bugs in it, and take your focus away from mentally being prepared for the interview. Relax and let them do the work of what to interview you on. 
Why not create a rewrite rule and put this filtering in the app.config of your application? This is for example behind a proxy: &lt;rewrite&gt; &lt;rules&gt; &lt;rule name="BlockOutside" patternSyntax="Wildcard" stopProcessing="true"&gt; &lt;match url="*" negate="false"/&gt; &lt;conditions logicalGrouping="MatchAll"&gt; &lt;add input="{HTTP_X_Forwarded_For}" pattern="243.212.*" negate="true"/&gt; &lt;/conditions&gt; &lt;action type="CustomResponse" statusCode="400" statusReason="Forbidden" statusDescription="Forbidden"/&gt; &lt;/rule&gt; &lt;/rules&gt; &lt;/rewrite&gt; Use a different variable than HTTP_X_Forwarded_For by the way (I don't think you're using a proxy. I think it's {REMOTE_ADDR}) 
The example I always asked people to write was: 1. Parse a CSV file with names, addresses, and birth dates 2. Create a UI (desktop or web) that lets users pick a month. 3. Use a stored procedure to get the list of names/addresses for people who were born that month 4. Generate a mailing list for birthday cards as a text file 
Thanks, I'm going to take a look :)
What I wish I know when I started out was knowing about different Data Structure (variable, list, array, dict, custom object ....) and that all language share the the structure. well, all languages has different data structure. Knowing this will save you a ton of time. 
You can follow my playlist if you want, right now my tutorial computer is on repair but the series will continue soon. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9fWNGgvZ-88JQXvqZNHze7MCY3Q88nt5
They specifically asked him to create an application to bring along to the interview, so sounds like a minus not to bring it, even if it is trivial. If anything, it allows the interviewers(some team members surely are present) a glimpse of how his code is. 
I cant endorse that course enough. you literally need 0 prep or knowledge to start, it will talk you through getting everything you need to get started. its 100% free including the materials you need. 
You do seem to have it well thought out. In my case I like to keep the data grouped together (fields) and separate from behavior (methods). Beyond that I rely on navigation to understand how a method relies on other members. I tend to do quick high level scans of the entire file to build a short term mental model and this works best if you cut out a lot of the syntax noise.

Think of something you want to write. And just do it. I started programming by writing scripts for a game then decided I wanted to write a top down real time strategy game from scratch. So I started in a language that on reflection was near impossible to achieve. But I gave it a crack because it was what i really wanted to do. I never finished it but it was good enough to show a programing friend of mine who got me a job the next day. So the key point is think of something you really want to write and go for it.
Hey bud, don't know what level you're studying just now but I found this post so informative that I decided to start the path the person suggested in the answer, so far so good man, the courses are very good and there is a ton of information that I didn't had a clue, so that encourage me to keep researching in certain topics that I have never heard before. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; [https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/8l4n01/what\_courses\_do\_you\_recommend\_taking\_on/dzghw8o](https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/8l4n01/what_courses_do_you_recommend_taking_on/dzghw8o)
 public string MaterialCode { get { return $"{Material.Category1Code}_ {Material.Category2Code}_...{Material.CategoryNCode}";} set { RaisePropertyChanged(nameof(MaterialCode)); } } This is **NEVER** acceptable. Under no circumstances should this test fail: myViewModel.MaterialCode = "A"; Assert.AreEqual("A", myViewModel.MaterialCode); 
What other languages, if any, do you already know? That's your starting point.
Is it your choice? We typically have a defined project every interviewee makes
Hey, just curious, when you ask interviewees to do this, were they left with the computer and the internet for a period of time, or were they expected to code it out in front of someone with no resources? This type of assignment makes way more sense to me than doing some obscure algorithm problem on a white board
We use wkhtmltopdf to convert HTML to PDF. HTML is pretty versatile, but most importantly, every developer in our shop can work with it, and it is part of our standard workflow. If no one is (used to) working with HTML, this probably isn't your best bet. If there is at least some knowledge, it's worth checking out.
Thanks for the reply. Wouldn't putting that in the code behind be breaking the MVVM pattern? I'm not using a framework at the moment, but was thinking about using ReactiveUI.
Since you mentioned golf. public int SmallerDollsCount =&gt; (containedDoll?.smallerDollsCount ?? -1) + 1; :P
It depends on what you are trying to develop, if you do your research properly before you choose how to code your app, you can figure out if it's a good fit or not. Sorry you are having trouble learning it, but I'm not and it works fine.
It is a bit of everything, on one way I think you are overthinking it, after all it is a new job on another domain and you want to make good. However given your description it also seems you need to ramp up those skills. So get some books or online tutorials on the areas that you feel lost and loose some nights or weekends ramping it up. I guess you might also lack domain knowledge, so try to get documentation or general information about the area that the software is supposed to be used on. Basically make a list of what you feel are your weak points currently and devise a strategy to improve upon them. There is no issue asking the colleges for support, just as a tip keep track of what you are asking and their answers, to avoid having to ask similar questions all the time.
- If you have a technical question, google it. if you don't find the answer in 10 minutes, ask a colleague. - bring a notebook to meetings, and write down things that you don't understand - but the most important thing is: asking 1000 questions is still better than asking 0 questions
If you have too many questions in a meeting, then you can write them all down and ask afterwards. 
Christ knows. It's dot net core if that helps?
I’m not a developer per se but I work in IT and when I was a bit more junior I felt the same way. Hell I still feel like that a bit when I’m put on a project late and other team members have all the specifics down and I’m new to it. It does get better with experience. One thing I started doing was asking people “do you mind if I ask you a question” before I did. It helped me feel a bit better about it because 9/10 they say yes so you’re reassuring yourself you’re not doing the wrong thing. It probably gets a bit boring and monotonous always doing that and eventually I had to teach myself to get out of that habit. It could sound a bit needy and whiny which is why I stopped but it was useful for me when I did have to ask tonnes of questions.
I second this. Don't use your colleagues as a substitute for google. If someone comes to me after having researched something already then I feel much better about helping them.
1 - people like you often overstate their uselessness just because they feel behind. 2 - do you want to be a dev or were you assigned that role? 3 - when you’re tasked with something new, it’s totally OK (and you should) ask someone for guidance on the first few steps. Writing the first line of code is daunting to anyone because there’s an infinite number of ways to solve a problem. That never goes away even for senior devs. Then ask them for good palaces to look for common answers to what you’re working on, which show them you appreciate their time and are doing all you can not to ask them. 4 - they know you’re a junior dev. Every dev I’ve encountered that didn’t ask someone a question after 20-30 minutes of fruitless work got the “why the heck didn’t you ask sooner? We don’t want you wasting time”
It could be mvc or pages then. The latter is newer and has less code
You had an interview with HRs and developers, right? If you work there, they must have decided your skills were enough to start. Do you have problems only with the project or with programming as a whole? I've started my job this summer (junior c# developer) and I've already had strong knowledge of c#. But our project is 5 years old and very complicated so I still get stuck with some tasks from time to time. If don't know c# well, try reading some books about it, for example, "Pro C# 7" (but this one may be complicated for beginners). If you want to know for sure, you could ask your teammates for a feedback on your progress. Also remember that even if someone is really an expert at their field, they may still experience an Impostor Syndrome. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome
Die solution should have a folder with the name "pages" and in there the controllers and views are grouped together. The controller have methods onget and onpost
If your employer wants to support your role change to become a junior developer, then they need to provide you with the necessary training to do so. Going straight into production work (I assume this is what you’re doing) with no previous coding experience is a path to trouble. But in the absence of support from your company, you’re going to have to line up something yourself. I would recommend maybe getting a Pluralsight or Lynda.com subscription and watching some of the programming fundamentals courses. These deal with not only concrete implementation in code, but also basic principles, patterns, processes and algorithms. Then move to the courses related to the specific language you’re using. Also, talk to your employer. I can’t speak for any country except my own (UK) but there are various government programmes such as the modern apprenticeship scheme which provides money to employers who train people for work skills. Finally, ask your peers and your seniors what they think you should be learning. They will know the kind of skills you need to do the work you’re involved in, so you can focus on stuff that is especially applicable to your line of work. Good luck!
This for sure. Don’t burn a day trying to figure something out, just ask a colleague. However there’s tons of stuff on google. If you’re colleagues tell you, “loop over this thing and run this function for each of those objects...” and you forget exactly how to do that, just google “c# iterate over list” or something like that. Become a good googler, usually you should be able to find what you’re looking for. The more questions you ask, the quicker you learn, the quicker you become efficient and a productive teammate. It’s in their best interest long-term to help you learn 
Don't have that. I have "Content", "Controllers", "Models", "Views".
As has been mentioned here before, PluralSight has well done c# tutorials as well as everything else. And if you have an MSDN subscription through work, I think that means it's entirely available to you. Do the whole course. Even if you have to do it in your own time, do it. The difference will be insurmountable. You will not even be able to.. surmount it.
I was in a similar position not that long ago, feeling exactly the same way. It's overwhelming and can feel like you're lost at sea on a raft. Your colleagues _want_ you to improve, and unless they're jerks, they'll also want to help. As developers one of the things we tend to love doing is talking about concepts and new ideas, so it's unlikely that they see you as burdensome - it's more likely that they enjoy being able to share their knowledge with you. Was anyone you work with led to believe that you have more experience than you do? Assuming no, they already know that it will take time and effort to get you up to speed. Programming is complex. You're learning so many things at once right now! A programming language has its own syntax, grammar, vocabulary, and semantics that you have to learn (it's really not that different from learning a spoken language) _plus_ you're hearing all kinds of high-level concepts and have been thrown into the deep end. It will take time, but you'll get there. Your colleagues want to help you. For some it's simply in their best interest, for others they really do enjoy helping. You mentioned not quite knowing how to translate a concept into code. I remember that stage of my learning well. I think what helped for me was learning some foundational stuff like how to code your own data structures and basic algorithms (queues, linked lists, simple sorting algorithms, etc). I don't want to turn this into a novel, so if you're looking for tips on how to bridge the gap between concept and code, shoot me a message and I'll be happy to help. Now take a deep breath, have a coffee, and take it one step at a time :)
Very few junior developers are not a burden. Statistically you are a burden. Therefore the way to not feel like a burden would be to lie to yourself :) On the bright side your coworkers probably expect that you are a burden just like most other junior devs so they will tolerate it. The real question is can you be less of a burden and exit the burden phase faster.
I was in a similar position to you when I started in programming. Your coworkers know that you don't have experience and they know that you are going to need help. Are there going to be those that react better to you asking questions? Yes. But it is in the best interest of everyone to get you going and up to a productive speed. I remember when I first started, apologizing to the senior programmer when I asked him anything. He was a prickly older guy who didn't want friends at work. One day he said to me, "Stop apologizing for asking questions. It's in my best interest to get you productive as fast and possible so you can take bigger projects We all knew what we were getting into when we hired you." It was probably one of the nicer things he said to me, but it was true. The faster I got going, the faster he could do less work. But I was hired as a junior so they knew not to expect much at first. One piece of professional advice I got from an executive at a company I worked for was that nobody is going to hire you for a job that they don't think you can do. They think you can do the job, that's evidenced by the fact that they hired you. So now you have to think you can do the job. This doesn't mean that you don't have to put in some work to get better on your own. If you have something tough, spend some time after work trying to research it. Also when you're at work, try to break down your problems to the smallest pieces. It's easy to look at a big problem and panic but when you break it down it doesn't seem as bad.
Go put on your tinfoil hat and refrain from giving people advice please. This is just a flat out lie.
Google walk troughs of project templates similar to those you are asked to work on. These generally explain things in a step by step manner, even if only the basics. Then when you don't understand or have questions google them. First year is tough but after you get some experience and a code base under your belt you'll be flying it until the next thing you don't know pops up and they pop up a lot. Learning is non stop in IT. I generally don't require new devs to produce much or under pressure for the first 3 months or so. Everyone needs to find their feet and impostor syndrome is a thing in every position. Stay calm and think. The more you understand a system the more you can adapt it to new scenarios.
So it's not razor pages then. Good. Are you getting both lists from the same controller action? Like do you returning a single object from the controller which contains both lists? 
I'm not. That seemed like a lot of work for a simple problem. I have a partial view, that I hoped I would be able to call and execute some code somewhere that would return a list with the data in.
There is where ViewModels come into play. Create a class to hold whatever data and attributes you'll need in the view: public class SomeViewModel{ public List&lt;Foo&gt; FooData {get; set;} public List&lt;Bar&gt; BarData {get; set;} // other properties as needed } When the view is requested by the user, create a new instance of `SomeViewModel` in a separate service/controller/etc. and pass it to the view. public ActionResult SomeView(){ SomeViewModel model = _someService.GenerateSomeViewModel(); return View(model); }
That's exactly the way it should work if you have multiple models(or lists) - a partial view for each list/controller action, which is then composed in a single view. There should be plenty howtos to it 
There was...not one of the examples I followed worked. Moaning about the wrong data type (string instead of my object) - there were no strings being returned from any method, anywhere. Didn't make a lot of sense. Another had the data in the "top" model appear in the bottom, despite being called something entirely different etc... Couldn't get one of them to work. Downloaded an example. Wouldn't build...and so on. I am so f*****ng done with computers.
Cheers. Not really following though... I have a class that outlines my model. In the home controller, that data is being returned quite happily. I have different data (that shares some of the same properties), the issue is I can't get the code that fills it up to run at all. I figured it would be something like: Html.RenderPartial("_RunningProcesses", "ProcessController"); ...or similar. But that does nothing. So I moved it into a new controller, but that does the same. 
I could help later if needed and explain some code examples over TeamViewer or chat, but will be available only in 2 hours. The mvc has some stupid things like model binding not functioning with foreach, but despite that it is straight forward thing. Also, "asp boilerplate" is a project worth to look at if some real life example is neaded. 
As has been said, try to find the answer yourself first. But don't waste a lot of time doing that. Most importantly, learn from the answer you get. The only burden I ever feel from questions is people asking the same ones more than once.
This was my single biggest help was a mentor at my first job teaching me how to google things properly. I'd struggle with finding stuff then ask for help after 30 minutes, but they'd always find the answer within seconds of me asking. It wasn't rocket science, but it made me so much more useful
Thank you, that's really kind but I think I'm about to walk out of my job and not look back in the hope that I never see another computer again...maybe find a chip shop that needs someone to man the fryer.
An hour is not much time to do something cool ... at least for mortals. You could focus on hitting some big techniques that would take much time but will impress lead dev types. Things like dependency injection, unit testing, use of logging libs like NLog and so on. What about a project that adds a watermark to an image when uploaded? Are you planning to practice before to make sure you can code it in an hour? You might want to allow extra time for the machine being slow and/or being awkward because it isn't your setup.
As long as you spend some effort into finding the answer yourself (just not the whole day), and show some initiative, I am sure they are happy to help. Really, even an experienced develop spends a lot of his time just getting better at how to learn himself stuff.
Looks impressive.
I have followed this one for distributed development: [https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers)
Ask who? Coworkers? Supervisor? 
Cryptography is about mathematics .. which is platform agnostic. Your issue is more complicated than PHP/.NET - there's infinite ways to encrypt data and I don't know how you do it. FIPS is a standard for handling sensitive data securely, especially in software used by the US government - so it's probably unrelated to your problem. 
I can make a youtube video in an hour and claim whatever I want. That doesn't magically turn it into proof. He might as well be some guy who's pissed at them because they didn't want his tutorials.
The guy has 500k subscribers, 48 million video views yet you want to defend Udemy like a paid shill. Funny how you talk about tinfoil hats and refuse to acknowledge all the evidence out there. 
There are a number of great resources out there. I think most developers understand that just like many things in life, you have to learn to walk before you can run. I'm sure your employer understands you have gaps to fill and they may have more patience for you than you realize. &amp;#x200B; You already know you need to improve skills so how can you do that? &amp;#x200B; Repetition! Keep building projects; do it in your free time. Follow along with tutorials and keep plugging away. Find tutorials from various coders. You'll see things done similarly as well as vastly different. One day you'll follow along with a tutorial and you'll find yourself building out in front of the tutorial in anticipation of the next steps. You'll get it; just keep trying and don't lose faith in what you can accomplish!
inb4 you call me a russian bot
For UWP (and WPF): https://github.com/Microsoft/InventorySample
Sounds like what I'm currently experiencing... Keep telling myself not to ask stupid questions, google shit first, and just try to chill out and hope I improve with time. Not sure if helpful, but at least know you're not the only person feeling that way mate.
Yeah, I can understand this. The whole core action has thrown all thing over the head and there are just so many old tutorial stuff. I am reading the documentation to mvc right now and find some funny things. May be what you need is "view component", not the partial view. I'll create a test project later. 
An example from one of my projects (I hope it helps): `@Html.Partial("~/Views/Project/SendToRevisionPartial.cshtml", Model.Admins)` `@Html.Partial("~/Views/Project/SendToRevisionPartial.cshtml", Model.Revisors)` My viewModel is loaded with two collections, Admins and Revisors, both inherit from Users. There is a reusable html control (not controller) with Razor sintax where a customized html table is made with each list. This reusable control gets a list of user as model and knows how to get the correct html.
I was referring to "how to do __ in C#" or "How to filter with LINQ" or "Why do I get Object reference not set to an instance of an object errors" type of questions, but I you're right, trying out different stuff on your own is great for learning.
Reviewing coworkers’ code can also help a lot, especially if you can find someone who can go over it with you. It’s a great time to ask a lot of questions in a row and take notes. If you’re unclear on what’s going on, try explaining what you think you understand to make sure you’re on the right track. Good senior devs will help explain why they chose one pattern over another, or maybe why the code you’re looking at is a compromise due to time or other technical debt - that information helps a lot.
I guess the OP wants to get both lists from different controller actions
I was thinking that if a implementation met the same standard on multiple platforms, that interop would be easier :)
The answers to most of your questions should be found in the code base itself. If you have a question like "how do I do this or that", the first place you should look for an answer should be in your project's code base. Your colleagues might have already answered your questions months before you joined the company. How did they do that? By writing nice looking and easy to understand code. Monkey see, monkey do is usually a good way to do things at first. After that you can try something like monkey see, monkey understand, money do before you finally stop being a monkey and become a human that is coding (it takes a while). If you can't for the love of God find the answer in your code base, Google is the next step. And finally asking your colleagues of course. 
In other words you ran out of arguments.
I'm horrible at recursion. I'll work a problem, get it and then five minutes later forget how to do it. If you could confirm this, I'd appreciate it. Generally, in a recursive method, you start out with your exit comparison. If it meets the exit criteria, do nothing/return something. If it doesn't meet the exit criteria, you "go one level down" ie, call the same method with the next directory or next node or what-have-you as the method's parameter.
Secirity team... can you use nuget packages? Or everything has to come real from you?
True. I always try to look for an answer online before asking
Better to ask the question than go three days into coding on your own, and then have no option but to ask the question.
The meetings are often too much in dept. It's a merchant bank, so they are talking a lot about finance and funds too. I don't want to have too much hay on my fork so I'm thinking to get my programming shit together first.
so basiclly 'Just do it?' mentality?
hi [u/sparkleypie](https://www.reddit.com/user/sparkleypie) I am in the exact same boat as you, except i don't really have colleagues , which makes it even more stressful as i dont have that guidance / people to ask. I put in a little SMS app recently for code review, and even tho it worked.. omg.. the review was brutal, someone else ended up just basically re-writing it, which was even worse because he did what had taken me a few weeks in a couple of hours... that was not a good day! What I'm trying to say is, I think this is just part of the process. I like others advice of trying to find a solution for 10 minutes, then if you cant find one ask. This is because not asking is even worse then asking to much. wasting hours looking up how to do something isnt great either ;) And finally, we are doing this to become Dev's. Don't lose sight of that goal. Screw the bastards who complain / act shitty. Ask what you need to, do not derail your dreams of becoming a dev because of someone elses shitty attitude. Take what you can from them, one day they will be asking you for things. And please, everytime you feel down and bad about things ( which i do often.. ) just keep reminding yourself to learn from everything, become the best developer you can. 
I really wanted to be a dev and won't give up either
https://gist.github.com/davidfowl/ed7564297c61fe9ab814 project.json changed the way .NET projects looked like, even though it doesn't exist - the current csproj format is pretty similar in terms of simplicity. 
Some programmers care about their job security and thus knowledge == power. Some just don't have the time to mentor others. Some are smug and will mock beginners. Anyway, do as much as you can by yourself and ask away only when you are stuck. Take notes and don't fear sacrificing a little time to discover by yourself what they are talking about.
* Pluralsight has a knowledge track of coursework related to C# that you can follow that is well structured and builds on previous courses, I'd highly recommend it * Google something for 10-15 minutes and then ask a colleague, as others have mentioned. Explain what you've tried so far and what research you've already done so they know what NOT to suggest, which is very valuable * Make a point to _learn_ the things you're being taught, don't just make note of it, use it for the immediate need, and forget it. As an SDET and QA Engineer before that I never minded playing 20 (or 20 thousand) questions with my junior team members - the only thing that really frustrated me was when they couldn't remember anything for more than an hour or two * Set up a OneNote/Evernote and start writing down the stuff you learn. If you find a really good StackOverflow answer copy the question and answer. Don't just keep this on a work device, keep a copy of it on your own too (or use a personal OneNote online with the web interface if work permits it) making sure not to include any proprietary company information. The reason I suggest OneNote/EN instead of a paper notebook is that in the future, if you're trying to remember some obscure bit of LINQ you can just search the whole notebook for it and find every reference to LINQ that exists. It's a powerful retention tool.
It's better to ask a ton of questions and actually learn things than to not get the project done or push something out that has hackish code in it.
Alot of your workday as a developer will be spend on google searches simply because there is no right answer, there might be a best though. Generally try to get a good understanding about program flow, not in a specific language but in general since it's basically the same in all of them. When you understand branching and looping like second nature then you are a long way. Always try to break down complex problems into its simplest formes, most times this let's you see what kind of branching and looping is needed and even state is as "normal sentences": Given a list of a's I need to check if some of they a's are also b's etc. When you can picture the flow the job is basically done, if there is something unclear at this point then if it is techincal google knows and you have a very specific guestion "how do I check if a is also b?". If the unknow is functional then you have to get more information from whoever gave youthe task, but you know specifically what you need to to ask "can an a also be c? " That is how I approach must tasks that have already been refined in my daily work, hope it can help. P.s. I hope atleast some of this made sense as I am not native English.
People hire junior developers on purpose. They know what they're getting into. You seem like you care enough to keep improving. Keep it up. Ask lots of questions. Even those of us with senior or lead in front of our titles get feeling the same way sometimes. You got this.
well I mean indexers.
I love questions from new programmers. I actually quite like the teaching process. But if you come ask me a question we have already been over before and you didn’t take notes, I start to lose interest in teaching the person and they become a pest / waste of my time the more times it occurs. 
Wanna share that Google-fu?
Removed: Rule 4. There are learning resources to get started programming C# in the sidebar, /r/learncsharp, and /r/learnprogramming. Dive in and give it a shot. If the code isn't producing the correct output, feel free to post it and explain what you're getting, what you expected, and what you tried. In particular, it looks like you'll need to know how to read input (`Console.ReadLine`), how to convert text input to a number (`Int32.Parse`), how to do a `for` loop, and output the results (`Console.WriteLine`). You can manually multiply the numbers against themselves 3 times to "cube" them, or use the `Math.Pow` method.
I have tried the property but says that it cant convert list string to string 
Thank you!! 
Just wanted to say that I just hired someone new and I really \*\*want\*\* them to ask more questions. Every time we grab a meeting room and I can walk them through the details of some process is an investment that easily pays for itself. &amp;#x200B; At meetings, you don't need to speak up. Just take notes about things you'll want to ask about later.
Never really - I have been a developer for 25+ years and about c# for about 10 of those. For me it was: 1. Understanding a specific design principle (like SOLID, not the only one, but is one worth looking into) or two 2. Understanding I will never know everything, it's still ok to ask questions and look something up and keep adding stuff to my personal knowledge list. I feel like I have a degree in "Googling Stack Overflow" instead of "Computer Science" ;) 3. Understanding design patterns and how to implement them in a system. 4. Finally, being comfortable with the language and it's future iterations. Not surprising, 1-3 have nothing to do with c# and can work with any language (as I consider my self pretty strong with JavaScript and TypeScript these days too) &amp;#x200B; YMMV though :)
Ooh I do that already lol. Good to know I'm doing **something** right haha
Edited my initial post, I completely overlooked that it might be useful!
Using something like a `class PriorityQueue&lt;P, T&gt; : Dictionary&lt;P, Queue&lt;T&gt;&gt; where P : IPriorityComparable` seems like a logical way to handle it.
Thank you for those encouraging words 
Just keep asking questions. There’s nothing wrong with that. On my team it’s frowned upon if you mostly sit out of discussions so everyone is constantly asking questions or clarifying their wording. 
I've been there. In 2000, I transitioned from being a front-end HTML guy to helping the development team with ASP Classic, then a few years later shifted over to .NET development (first [VB.NET](https://VB.NET), then C#). I felt like a total and complete idiot and a few times, almost decided that I was too stupid to be a software developer and considered changing careers. There's a lot to know. It seems so easy for the experienced guys and gals you're working with, and it's easy to feel stupid. You're not stupid, just inexperienced. Programming is a lot like learning a foreign language - you have to crawl and use baby-talk before you can run and be an awesome dev. You've got great advice in here - especially about googling before you ask a question. I'd add that you should Google and then ask the question along with a proposed solution if you find one - this will allow you to also learn why certain approaches seem obvious and easy but aren't used due to performance or other concerns. Hang in there - rely on your mentors to steer you in the right direction and put in the work and you'll be awesome in no time.
I never really had a consistent pattern before, but I'm liking the way you think.
Tricky. I was going to say you were wrong, then I noticed the bit with the -1.
&gt;delegates Thanks goodness. I'm learning them right now and I'm finding a very hard challenge to find their purpose, glad that it is at least challenging to any one else. 
I feel your pain. I've been there. &amp;#x200B; What language do you use at work? I suggest doing online tutorials for that language in your spare time and doing as much reading and practice in your spare time as possible until you feel comfortable with the language. Also, it's worth being aware of, and constantly reminding yourself that programming is a MASSIVE topic. NO ONE knows everything, even about one language. It is very common/standard to see people googling how to do x y z and then usually being led to [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com) (excellent website, lots of questions and answers there). You should do the same, if you don't know something, that's ok. Just hop to stackoverflow and see if anyone has asked similar question (most likely). &amp;#x200B; I find when I'm in a working environment I often end up with 10+ tabs to stackoverflow by the end of a working day.
Presently I'm writing a low-level engine that reads/writes xml from one system to another. Parsing and reading XML data with xmldoc and xmlnode. 
I made a sample repository for the partial view usage as @atokamak and @abandonedarchive described. I'll add also the view component example in the same project as well. [https://github.com/ostelaymetaule/dotnet\_sandbox](https://github.com/ostelaymetaule/dotnet_sandbox)
I gave them the assignment a week in advance. Using someone's limited interview time to lock someone in a room and ignore them is very rude.
I’ve had that “locked in a room” experience as the interviewer, and I agree it is rude
Ask user for input of values for a and b. Pass the values to a method. Initialize a for loop with the starting value of a and the ending value of b. ( this assumes that user will always input an integer and a &lt;= b.) iterate through the for loop. Do your computation display results. And when the loop is done you are done.
Is your entire goddamn class coming to this sub for their homework?
&gt;How can I approach my colleagues without feeling like a burden every time? It's really simple and I know I'm gonna get a lot of flak for saying this, but I honestly don't care. You've been hired for a job, for which you don't have the required skills. Either you acquire those skills or you find another job which suits your skill set.
The goal should be to help. Not to simply give the answer.
I help by giving the answer, then explaining how to derive it himself. That's called "teaching".

Cool, i have acctually made the part with pressing "+" and storing the string to a xml, work. However, i dont seem to be able to make the Combobox read the xml correctly, and specify the right values in the right places. 
Hey. Just wanted to say sorry for coming out quite harsher than I meant on my earliere post. It have been a quite bad week for me.
I'll take a look shortly to see how I've done it (xml to text box). Easy stuff, i think you have to escape slashes or something - can't remember at the moment... 
How did you get hired with no coding experience?
The first thing to do is to write out the step by step instructions in a normal language. From there, you can translate that into a programming language. For example: Get the minimum value from the user. Get the maximum value from the user. for each number from the minimum value to the maximum value, do the following: [Then put when you have to do here, and then whatever you need to do after the loop and so on]. Once you have that, try turning that into C# code that you know. If you're in a class currently, you should be able to take each step and figure out how to write it in code. After you've done all that, if you still have problems try posting again, but include the following: * The normal language (pseudo code) steps of what you're trying to do. * Your code, or a link to your code. (If you post the code, make sure you start the lines with spaces rather than tabs. That will format it correctly on Reddit). You may find people more willing to help if you put in some effort yourself first, and show what effort you put in. Currently, it just looks like you're trying to get the solution to your homework, which is problematic since it's a really easy puzzle.

The best advice I’ve heard is “Don’t ask the question until you’ve invested enough in it that you won’t forget the answer.” It’s a good rubric because it encourages you to look on your own and ensures that you are in fact learning, not just using your coworkers as a crutch. Congratulations on your new position!
Thank you for your guidance, much appreciated!
Senior dev running my own company here: This might sound crazy, but try asking the question to yourself before asking out loud it out to others. Try understand the architecture of the project you are working on, and zoom in on the detail. When asking a question: try and formulate it with as much context on what piece of code does not make sense to you. 
True!
Love it. I was able to get it doing some COM/Interop too updating the UI. Right now there's no way to publish a self contained build, is there?
Obviously, you could approach this with attributes attached to the action or the controller. You could also handle it in the pipeline. Binding of poco models would be more complicated. You could use dynamic objects or simply treat payloads as strings. Nugets like [automapper(http://automapper.org/) would provide a nice framework for mapping objects between versions.
OAuth is possible but it is a bit trickier and, in some flows, would require a web server to receive the oauth callback. Of course, you can do simple user name/password auth but most times that won't be as secure as other approaches.
&gt;the infrastructure necessary to have only the "latest version" of controllers/models/business logic, while still listening on "older" versions [URL Rewriting middleware](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/url-rewriting?view=aspnetcore-2.1) can forward requests from old endpoints to new endpoints without being visible from the client side. &gt;mapping older requests up through a revision pipeline to finally hit the current controller/implementation &gt;being able to bind to older POCO models which may differ slightly from the current models Since the url rewriting middleware is causing all the requests to hit the current action method, we just need to ensure that old model types can be translated to new model types before they're passed as arguments on the action method. [Custom model binders](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/advanced/custom-model-binding?view=aspnetcore-2.1) allow this. AutoMapper rules can be set up to translate the old models parsed from the request into the new model format. &gt;Mapping responses back down to the requested version The URL rewriting middleware should include in the query string some data that indicates the desired version of the response. This can be passed to the constructor of a custom ActionResult; refer to the [ActionResult&lt;T&gt; implementation](https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/blob/master/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core/ActionResultOfT.cs). The custom action result should use AutoMapper to translate the response back to the desired version. &gt;where to put and how to manage older POCO models (esp. if using a shared client model library - don't want them cluttering that up) Don't put the client library in the same repository as the server code. Nuget the shared portions if you need to, but the models should be defined independently but identically in both the client and server code. Don't put yourself in a situation where you need to relocate old models in the server code when rolling a new client version.
Hello World
YouTube Mosh and all jesse dietrichson’s c# videos. Jesse is awesome at explaining things and has helped me immensely. 
Cool, thanks!
 My code actually uses a StreamReader object to return a string to a text box. The return value is a string with no modifications to it, XML text. However, it is being applied to a TextBox's text property, not a Combobox. 
I’ve been in your position about a year ago. It’s tough mentally, but it’s down to you now to put in the time and effort to do what it takes to succeed in your field. Break every problem down into the smallest and simplest steps possible, don’t get overwhelmed by the overall solution. If you’re a visual learner try drawing out or writing how you think your application/ method (whatever you’ve been asked to do) works in Lehman’s terms or flow diagrams and work out how you get from statement to statement. That will give you a starting point to then covert what your writing/drawing into functional code. Once you have your first attempt at the code or get stuck, ask for a code review but be ready to explain CLEARLY what you were trying to do even if you didn’t manage it. Prove your ability to be good at problem solving, that will impress them more and allow you to think more freely about code and syntax later. Learn the basics of your language, YouTube and google are great resource - but don’t try and run before you can walk. A lot of advice above but in a year I’ve gone from a junior software developer who learnt on the job to being promoted to a mid-level developer. I’m not stupid but I’m not smart, if I can do it then anyone can, trust me. If you need any help with anything then please feel free to message me anytime.

According to /r/SQL this would be the following in regular SQL code, but I have no idea how to convert it to Linq: SELECT E.FirstName, E.LastName, COUNT(\*) AS OrderCount FROM Employees AS E INNER JOIN Orders AS O ON E.EmployeeID = O.EmployeeID GROUP BY E.FirstName, E.LastName ORDER BY E.FirstName, E.LastName
When providing your code, it's usually better to do so in plain text rather than as a screen shot; reformatting can make it more readable to the people you're asking and allows us to copy relevant sections out more easily when we want to refer to them during the discussion. var countByName = Employees .Where(e =&gt; e .EmployeeReportsTo != null ) .Join( Orders, e =&gt; e.EmployeeId, o =&gt; o.EmployeeId, (e, o) =&gt; e) .GroupBy( e =&gt; (FirstName: e.FirstName, LastName: e.LastName), (e, records) =&gt; (FirstName: e.FirstName, LastName: e.LastName, Orders: records.Count())); I think this will get what you want. 
Stackoverflow is your friend.
I'm not really senior, just a difference in experience in certain areas - but when I help people I like to just sit with them, make suggestions and not take the keyboard/mouse off them. When we exhaust our ideas and get to Google I just suggest things to Google, and I think that probably helps them a lot more than watching me Google things myself.
You can add "site:stackoverflow.com" to the end of your search term to obly get stackoverflow results, same works for "site:reddit.com" and other websites
I disagree, the ViewModel is a specialized Model for the View, translating Properties from the Model to the View. The ViewModel can expose Model properties as VM properties. 
Why so serious, because I can make it modern, because I can make it parse JSON, because I can do this or that, i simply choose the easiest path to working and then ameliorate on that. The "Dirty strings" should've been a sign *WARNING STRING parsing*.. but w.e. private static async Task&lt;HttpContent&gt; GetDownloadsAsync() { List&lt;string&gt; FileNames = new List&lt;string&gt;(); string data = ""; using (HttpClient http = new HttpClient()) { http.BaseAddress = new Uri(ConfigSettings.FileUrl); http.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));//ACCEPT header http.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("x-rssbus-authtoken", ConfigSettings.Token); HttpResponseMessage response = await http.GetAsync("?Folder=Sent&amp;Subfolder=Downloads&amp;PortId=" + ConfigSettings.PortId); data = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync(); response.Content.Dispose(); response.Dispose(); if (data != "") { JObject job = JObject.Parse(data); foreach (string FileName in job.SelectTokens("value[0].Filename")) { response = await http.GetAsync("(MessageId='CIN-5269-77311312004054-61b2f210-9158-48d5-b6c8-26fccb16e1ef',PortId='" + ConfigSettings.PortId + "',Folder='Sent',Subfolder='Downloads',Filename='" + FileName + "')"); StreamWriter sw = File.CreateText(ConfigSettings.Incoming + "\\" + FileName); data = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync(); await sw.WriteAsync(data); } } } return null; } 
Knowing async/await is only a part of concurrency. There are more than async/await to learn, for example Reactive Extensions, TPL, etc. 
I'm a beginner in asynchronous programming, but from my understanding the first one will block the thread which executes this line. With the second line this or another thread will come back after the delay is over and will execute the next line in code. 
Thank you, and I'll keep that in mind. I'll let you know whether it works.
[This Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13140963/15880) seems to agree with you.
Having a property with a set that doesn't actually set a value is not a great idea. You should call RaisePropertyChanged on MaterialCode in each of the setters for the properties that can change. It's annoying. I've read that something like PostSharp can handle this, but that's kind of expensive.
This sounds like homework. What have you tried so far?
It's the last one of a big series of Linq exercises. Not homework, but from school though. I keep getting stuck thinking on using .Where(p =&gt; p.ProductName.Substring(0.1), but that doesn't get me anywhere because I wouldn't know how to make a condition out of that.
Try making a new projection with a .Select() to make a new enumerable that has the first letter of your product name... then go from there.
Well I can't define the letter, or did I misunderstand ?
[grouping in LINQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/group-clause)
You're looking for an aggregation (how many products start with A, B, C, etc), so with LINQ, you'll want to start with a GroupBy call. What you are 'grouping by' is the first letter of the ProductName. After the GroupBy, you'll be left with an IGrouping&lt;string,T&gt;, which you can access the 'Key' property (what you grouped by), and an IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; of the aggregated grouping. From there, you can use the Count() method to get the count.
I agree!
Life isn't about the knowledge skill and experience you have, it's about your ability to gain more of those things. Invest time in learning how to learn better. Googling, reading docs, mentally figuring out patterns and concepts and not only how they slot together, but why. Syntax is just muscle memory.
How do you avoid the limitations of not having out parameters and that the only allowed return types are void and Task in async methods?
I find [Quill18Creates](https://www.youtube.com/user/quill18creates) to be great. Hes a bit more advanced as well as being focused mainly on Unity. (Although he has a tutorial in a Console App making a game).
I'd like to say first that putting someone on the spot to create an application from scratch in an hour is a terrible interviewing mechanism. There's no bounds to it, and there's not enough time to actually get anything exciting done. At best it shows you can manage something basic on your own, and at worst it shows off mistakes, poor coding habits, and a lack of forethought. &amp;#x200B; If you're serious about this interview, though, you definitely need to bust out a few applications on your own tonight so you're ready. The easiest is some basic command line projects, and if you're up for it move to visual applications. At the very least this will work out any kinks in what you're going to demo, even if the logic/meat of the application shifts in the interview. &amp;#x200B; You said this is a security focused development group, so be ready to talk about how to protect your code, understand ideas like 'defense in depth', 'principal of least privilege', and 'security over obscurity'. None of these are hard concepts, it's just important to know how you apply them to the code. If you really want to surprise them, show them that you understand some of the most basic online attack vectors. If you've never given it a browse, the OWASP organization does a great writeup: [OWASP Top 10 Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project) , with quick downloads of their cheat sheets. &amp;#x200B; Hope that helps, good luck!
Sounds like not all of the information is for you. Just focus on what is relevant to you. If it's about another department then I wouldn't worry about it. 
`Task&lt;T&gt;`
That’s not ASCII, it’s IBM codepage 437 or something (standard OEM codepage on Windows). Codepages like that are called “ANSI” or “Extended ASCII”, but those are bad names as it’s not a single code page, but a bunch of different ones with different graphical characters (if any).
As I remember that was CLR limitation, so you have to return some complex object, custom one or tuple. With C#7 and named tuples it's even easier than out parameters.
Seems like you need to implement a Publisher/Subscriber pattern by introducing a middle man. * CollectorVM's subscribe to an event on an arbitrary `EventManager` instance (probably a singleton). * Where UiAncestorCollector would normally invoke the delegates, have it "publish" an event on the same `EventManager` instance, probably via some `Publish(SomeEventArgs arg)` method. * Upon a call to Publish, the EventManager will then invoke the appropriate event that all of the CollectorVM instances have presumably subscribed to. * Upon receiving the event, each CollectorVM does what it needs to do. * Now you show your pop up. I think simply introducing a third player in the whole thing might be enough to trigger an epiphany for you :-D, assuming I've understood the problem domain correctly anyway.
Note async void exists only for event handlers ([see here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/jj991977.aspx)). Otherwise you return a Task if you method doesn't need to return a value or Task&lt;T&gt; where T is the value you wish to return. using `await Task&lt;T&gt;` will give you a T. As for out parameters you do lose them with async methods, you just have to wrap your response in a full return object.
Any progress to report? 
Depends on what direction you want to go. Get your hands dirty - keep your eyes open to spot repetitive tasks in your workflows and write software to automate it. Do small but real projects. Towers of Hanoi is nice, but writing a tool that automatically sorts your fucked up download folder is amazing ;-)
strive to never be told twice. Write it down. Consult it first.q
Not yet. Been busy working on a C project in an effort to hone my low level memory management skills. FWIW I did just write a planar based image format to reduce the write time to GFX memory when working on VGA systems. The CSV parsing is going to end up being my next project though
This doesn't get any better, you just are able to panic successfully over bigger and bigger piles of uncertainty as time goes on.
I have this, but I don't get how to proceed: Products .GroupBy(p =&gt; p.ProductName.Substring(0,1))
1. Remember that you are not your work. Code reviews are not criticisms about something you are, only something you've done. It will take some time to prove to your teammates that you are open to effective communication. Focus on relaxing your body language and actively listening to people so that they feel comfortable approaching you with feedback about things you're doing well. 2. Humans do not have stack frames. Your colleagues may fail to provide you guidance for any number of reasons, but most likely is that they simply don't remember what advice they needed. They have their own workflow going on and their build environments are probably running hot so haven't been re-built from scratch in months. Try not to hold it against them for needing to be asked questions, sometimes repeatedly, in order for them to process what you actually need help doing. 3. Try to maintain more than one task at a time. This way if you get stuck and panic then you can switch to your other task until you calm down. Many developers find it helpful to focus on something different and let the problem work itself out subconsciously. This has to do with the way information is constantly compartmentalized in the brain; sometimes we need to let those compartments fade away so that the problem can be reconstructed step by step. 4. Slow down and organize better. Use mindmaps, use drawings in your notebooks, write simple logs of tasks and ideas in N++, do everything you can to track what's going on. Keep your system up to date. Keep your mailbox sorted and all messages read. Stay tidy and organized and it will vastly help to reduce the amount of stress you feel. 
I would kind of expect that even for Junior position you must know at least something 🤷‍♂️ If you jumped right in with zero experience, zero learning, zero home projects, nothing....then it's really stupid and you really are a burden to a team. In your shoes I'd spend all nights and all weekends learning really hard just to get at least to junior level so you don't bother your colleagues with common programming questions. 
Psh, with that attitude you'll have junior devs looking up to you in no time.
Yeah, that makes it a little more difficult. Visual Studio Community is free to download.
I agree with tons of the stuff already posted, but here are my two cents in addition (fair warning: I didn't read every comment so these might have been mentioned already) - ask to pair program with more experienced team members - take advantage of free online training. Given you are on the csharp sub I am assuming you are in a Microsoft shop. If you have an MSDN license you can get 6 months of pluralsight free. Also at the Ignite conference two weeks ago MS also announced [Microsoft Learn](http://microsoft.com/learn) 
 using System; using System.Linq; using System.Collections.Generic; public class Class1 { public class Products { public string ProductName { get; set; } } public void DoStuff() { List&lt;Products&gt; AllProducts = new List&lt;Products&gt;(); // TODO Fill products collection with data here... // group by the first letter of each product name, then return the letter and the count of those letters IEnumerable&lt;Tuple&lt;string, int&gt;&gt; results = AllProducts .GroupBy(p =&gt; p.ProductName.Substring(0, 1)) .Select(g =&gt; g, g.Count()); foreach(Tuple&lt;string, int&gt; result in results) { Console.WriteLine($"{result.Item1} : {result.Item2}"); } } } Hope this helps. If it's for an assignment, your teach is probably going to demand you explain what a Tuple is. You could use a var, but I don't recommend it. In linq it's just as helpful to define the variable clearly as it is to use comments. &amp;#x200B; You could also return the data to a dictionary, if that helps you.
oh.. and this makes a lot of assumptions, such as: 1. All Products in the list aren't null 2. All Products in the list have ProductNames that aren't null 3. All ProductNames are a size of 1 or greater 4. You have already done whitespace trimming to remove leading spaces in ProductNames 5. You're using a compiler that can compile c# 7.0 (otherwise you need to fix the Console.WriteLine)
I prefer to use this in non-async methods over Wait(), due to how it throws exceptions. SomeMethod().GetAwaiter().GetResult(); &amp;#x200B; And of course in an async method: await SomeMethod(); &amp;#x200B; But it's the same answer as others have said, in a synchronous method you are actively locking up the thread until the result comes back, and you should avoid it generally.
So I've added the anonymous object via the Select but I don't know what to fill it with. I'm not familiar with the term 'key'.
As JirTanna said, what's most popular now is that your templates are built in HTML and then all you have to do is convert the HTML to PDF. wkhtmltopdf and Headless Chrome are both great, free open source libraries. They can be tricky to get setup as it would still require you to run and install on your servers. To get around that, I created [api2pdf](https://www.api2pdf.com) which is an API for those libraries to make them easier to use and scale. Would be happy to help if you're interested, just let me know.
Check out Pluralsight's educational track on C#. Also, look at Bob Tabor's series of videos on Microsoft Virtual Academy, would highly recommend.
This is really good advice. Knowing how to search Google for really specific things is an art form especially when it comes to programming related queries. I’ve also found that I have to use a tiered Q &amp; A approach a lot. - Write down in general terms what you’re trying to accomplish. - Now break that down into individual pieces that each perform one single task. - Once you have that you can search for each of those individual pieces and from there you’re putting a puzzle together. For reference I’ve been learning Python, C#, Unity3D, and Blender in my free time. I use Python and C# in my day job to automate things within my company and for my own tasks. So I sit down and say I need to change a couple of lines in all 10,000 of these CNC programs but that will take forever and people will forget about it. So I need to “walk through every directory, find a file based on X conditions, open the file, search within the file, based on Y and Z conditions do ABC to the file, and then resave it. Google searching for each of those steps as a newbie, piecing them together and having a finished product at the end is so fulfilling. 
Aside for spending more time on googling, you need to treat your new profession with care. You need to engage in continuing education by keeping up to date on current trends and learn a new technology. The book the pragmatic programmer -- advocates for a 40hrs for work and 20hrs for yourself. shoot for a few weeks, months to devote 20 hours of your free time to learning. Learning could be 1. try a new framework or programming language out 2. read about existing technology you're working on. * My First year at my current job I looked for every C# book i could get my hands on. Sure I worked with it during the day, but reading different ways of using the language and different features were eye opening. 3. attend a user group for the technology you're working on (use this to ask questions from others) Invest in things like Pluralsight and Safari Books its like $600 combined, but well worth the time you'll save googling trying to learn about a tool or technology. More than just the language: focus on the fundamentals. Learn more about your operating system (usually Linux). Learn about the various text editors. Get comfortable working in the shell (bash or powershell) Finally, work on personal problems. Doing the online dating scene? Try automating messing. Maybe do some data scraping. The only place this doesnt shine: Proprietary stuff. Unless your company has a lot of documentation, you'll need to get better at grepping the company code. 
&gt; as well as where documentation is inadequate So true. I wrote thorough "how to get your dev environment set up" and it didnt work for the new dev. I relized there were glaring things missing from the code or steps that needed to be added. 
I've always enjoyed junior developers who take initiative. I know that you're not going to know everything that's required. I expect you'll ask questions, perhaps a lot of them. But, if you wanted to impress me as a junior: - Show you've attempted to come to a solution by yourself. - Do that by: - Googling - Stackoverflow - Documentation &amp; API - Looking for examples in the codebase. - Show me you've tried by: - Explaining your problem to me, show you have a grasp of the problem. Not just "Hey ocbaker, I have a problem, plz fix kthx" - When I help you, you want to: - Ask me on how to solve the problem yourself, not to solve it for you. - If you don't understand how I came to the solution, ask! - If appropriate, feed the solution back to me, show that you've understood by telling me you understanding. Not everyone is going to be like me when dealing with Junior Developers. But I love dealing with junior developers who show they have a hunger for knowledge and a passion for what they're doing. Nothing feels more rewarding when dealing with a junior dev than seeing their skills and confidence grow, and knowing that you've helped that person grow.
I've been looking at this and it was suggested by a colleague, but a lot of the courses are dated 2016 in the track. How valid are they still? Where is the age line for study material? Like, I'll assume content from 2015 and before is probably too old?
I enjoy training juniors. Ask all the dang questions you want. If a senior gives you grief for asking questions, they are a shitty senior.
I had a similar problem but for C. It only took me a day to write my own. Probably quicker than hunting down something from somewhere else and trying to figure out how it works.
I wish the senior engineers at my work were more like this. The new guys are always fed to the wolves, working on super complex proprietary code. I was lucky enough to have a mentor for about a month. Now that I've figured out how stuff works (7 years later), I try as much as possible to help this way. It is very often I am teaching a new guy something and they simply just stop and say "can you do it and I'll watch". I always say no because you won't learn as well this way. Also, as a new guy, if you ask for help and find a senior guy controlling your computer, jumping around code and making a fix for you, ask them to stop or slow down and have them explain. I see many senior engineers just doing the work for a new guy attempting to explain like the new guy knows what they're doing. Last tidbit.. always ask questions, no matter how new or senior you are; it shows you actually care about what you're doing. 
Have you tried creating the directory where the ref is pointing to and dumping the files in there?
Ask one of your coworkers if you can pair program. If they do TDD, then playing ping pong is a fun exercise. One person writes the test. The other makes the test pass by writing the fulfilling code. Your coworker can give you as much help and guidance as you need through this process. And ask them to try to explain what they are doing while they do it. This exercise is rewarding for both sides. 
Why not use SerialPort.IsOpen()? If true, then create the messagebox as desired. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.ports.serialport.isopen?view=netframework-4.7.2 
Thank you very much for this! 
I guess you can use `var result in results` 
Lots of answers, I read through the first 7-8. Wanted to give my input, but it may already be covered. 1. **Don't be afraid to ask** ***useful*** **questions.** Asking useful questions does not make you a burden. But, if you're going to ask questions, **do your due diligence first**! The worst question you can ask is one that you could literally have answered from Googling. A developer will ask a question like &gt;Jr. Dev: Hey John, I can't figure out why X won't initialize. &gt; &gt;Sr. Dev: Did you try searching "how to initialize X"? &gt; &gt;Jr. Dev: Not yet, I'll try that next. (I'd argue that **that** is when you're actually a burden.) 2. **Don't overthink.** Often, I find that developers are trying to work out an entire solution to the problem instead of breaking it down and working on small bite-sized parts. Your first priority is to make it work (in the context of your solution, and following the company's current architecture). Don't worry about refactoring and optimizing until it actually works! (And before anyone jumps in to correct me, please remember we're talking about Jr. Devs here. In my experience, any kind of optimization that they come up with will be moot anyway.) 3. **Be humble**. Don't take code feedback personally. There's no reason to! Think back on the times when you've helped someone reach the correct answer without giving it to them, and try to see that your leads are (trying) to help you in the same manner.
1. it's not like they weren't you 1. it's not like there's some job that isn't this way (you actually have to learn how to dig a grave, man) 1. you just feel bad because you aren't perfect and humans expect to be otherwise 1. pour your grief into motivation for reading 1. no, more reading than that 1. more than that 1. stop sleeping and read
Pick a prime, do some math on it. Yeah I was hoping someone would help me with that. Now that I have the name for that, I can google it. Thanks.
Yep, the first one is blocking. If you're going to use it, you should just replace it with Thread.Sleep(5000)
This is 90’s stuff I used to do as a kid in DOS. 💗 
You might be able to write a small program by hand and use T4 templates to write the flies. Have you tried the stock Paste Json as classes option in VS? Not sure how that would behave with ref though. Maybe a combo of both approaches or even a PS script after pasting as classes would work. Might be a fun project to work on in github
The junior developers I enjoy working with ask good questions, and ask questions demonstrating they've had a good look themselves online or their own research. The ones who write things down or actually try and understand the part of the system they're working with rather than try and solve that specific problem. The junior developers I don't enjoy working with come to me without any prior investigation, or come to me with the same exact problem multiple times. The best junior developers are the ones who have found a new way of working with the things they have learned in the company. The fresh pair of eyes insight is really cool.
&gt; can any ORM do it by default. Uhm, no. They need to add code for that of course. &gt; why don't they bother with implementing those things? Lack of time, lack of experience, lack of interest, lack of roi. There could be a million reasons.
&gt; Lack of time, lack of experience, lack of interest, lack of roi. There could be a million reasons. Of course they need time. But sometimes developers refuse to add some features, cos they see them as not suitable for a product. And they clearly state the reasons. I was asking if such a reason exists or not
Thank you all for responding. In the scenario I was describing, the intent is to use the Material object to retrieve information only. In other scenarios, however, the Material object's properties are editable. Thank you, grauenwolf, Ronald\_Me, and chronicles2k for taking the time to respond and share your thoughts abd advice.
Probably projects as large as the ones I'm dealing with here at work. I basically only have ReSharper installed because my boss tells me to. Its purpose may have been to speed things up for the developer, but on my system (also 32 GB ram and an SSD drive) it slows things down so much that it defies the purpose entirely.
It's that usually the support for Vectorized Inserts and BulkCopy / DumpToTable is not standardized across DBs. When we built our DB Abstraction layer for our main app, we had to build a custom cludge to support Oracle, MSSQL and Postgresql. That was a pain to get working, even for out limited use cases, so I can't imagine how hard it would be to get it running for many other DBs, with a fallback in case it doesn't work. As a reference, here's what we used. Oracle: OracleBulkCopy to send a DataTable to the server is not well supported when the OracleDB is using DataGuard, this causes all kinds of issues. Therefore it is important to use a Vectorized Insert with an OracleCommand that uses [ArrayBindCount](https://blogs.oracle.com/oraclemagazine/put-your-arrays-in-a-bind). MSSQL: We use [SqlBulkCopy](http://richorama.github.io/2017/11/28/sql-bulk-copy/) directly. Postgresql: We use a "COPY *TABLENAME* ( *COLUMNS*) FROM STDIN (FORMAT BINARY)" and then use the npgsql [BeginBinaryImport](https://www.npgsql.org/doc/copy.html#binary-copy)
The software is an [Energy Optimization platform](https://builtwithdot.net/project/144/ts-energy) delivered to power companies, with the cost of the Oracle DB license growing every year, we decided to migrate to multi-db hosting. So it's internal to our software, but delivered. 
Why not just do the EWS operations in C# directly? [Get started with EWS Managed API client applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/client-developer/exchange-web-services/get-started-with-ews-managed-api-client-applications) [Connecting to EWS by using the EWS Managed API 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/developer/exchange-server-2010/ff597939\(v%3Dexchg.80\))
Felt like I was reading code made by a toddler
Well you shouldn't trust MS QA more, that's just a little naive. MS has screwed things up countless times. Dapper Plus's source code is on github. Lastly, as mentioned SqlBulkCopy is available for Sql Server.
Dapper's is available. And properly tested by a great community. Dapper plus is zzz's project. And it is closed source, as they sell it. When something is not open source or not created by respected company I can't include it into my client's app. As it is a huge risk. 
I'll take a look, thanks!
This this this, my old computing teacher had a lecture a week devoted to 'how to Google the things we covered for this week' and they are to this day some of the most useful skills I have when programming
You mean the little arrows on the right? It's where the text is being wrapped by the editor (word wrap)
No, the blue bars next to the line number
That's new to me, plugin?
Haven't installed anything and I've never seen it before either. 
Nah you know how when you change lines, it puts the yellow mark in there on the sides? Here I've got the yellow up there near the top right but just below it I have that blue line on the left of the scrollbar, one to match on the left side of the file by the line numbers.
&gt; The only thing I can think of **is to get bette**r, I think you reply to your question here. Now, my question to you is, how are you going to achieve your goal? Have you stop to think about this and elaborate a plan that you can fulfil in a short period of time? Now, depending of the technologies and languages your company is using, you might want to focus in invest some time in identifying what exactly you are struggling with, and start with the most basics and move on. Also, if you commute (bus || train) then you should spent your time listening some podcast, reading a book or even if you can afford it, get your self a membership in Pluralsight (or any site alike) with topics you are struggling. My point is that you must take action from today and going forward with it. Remember, a developer is always in a constant cycle or learning, it doesn't stop when you left uni/college/bootcamp. Good luck. 
Well this project isn't on any source control and no other file does it... 
I dont think any have them out of the box since it is difficult. I got around it slightly by launching a new thread per item I wanted saved, but I could get away with it because they didn't need to be in a single transaction (sync process would get a missed one 5 minutes later). For bulk insert, sqlbulkcopy is the way to go and you can do tricks to convert the entity directly to a datatable to bulk insert, but only one table worth. with EF, if you are more than 1 table deep you cant bulk insert that anymore. That's why bulk insert should be outside of the ORM since it is a specific use case that would get super tricky to implement in all cases.
I was happy to see VS's paste as JSON option. It just ignores the refs though. I'm really surprised no tool does this.
He might be onto something, if you zoom out so that it doesn't word wrap does it go away?
I really wanted to do a bootcamp, just don't have the money for it. I took a basic programming course that was available within the company. Bought C# books, using udemy and pluralsight and have a guy I'm dating which is also my mentor. I found learning with Bob Tabor really useful, so I'm thinking to purchase his courses on DevU... I'm not doing anything I can to get better, but I'm really trying. Thanks!
Ye I get you. The person you're trying to teach something will actually learn more by doing things themselves rather than just giving the straight answer. Some brain cracking is good practice :)
[Lets see what I can do](https://pastebin.com/embed_iframe/6yX88JkB)
Don't think it's related to word wrap. Just tried it in my VS2017, and the arrows are there, but not blue lines.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44129996/blue-lines-in-visual-studio-editor-margin
If you hover the mouse over the blue line next to the line numbers do you get any tool tips or other popups? 
Here is an explanation - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44129996/blue-lines-in-visual-studio-editor-margin
Happy cake day! So the dark green I didn't notice before is "Track Changes after save", yellow is "Track Changes before save" and the blue is "Track reverted changes." Thanks for the info :)
Well first you probably to save whatever you're searching for somewhere: string target = "Anders"; After that you can just check up against each element in your array in the for loop, using a simple if statement: for (int i = 0; i &lt; arr2.Length; i++) { if (arr2[i] == target) // Check for equality. { // Matches search term. Do something. } else { // Doesn't match search term. Do something else. } } Does that help?
Okay, at least we can check it off the list for sure.
Removed: Rule 4.
Removed: Rule 4.
I saw one guy on stackoverflow creating temporary tables from c#, populating it with bulk insert and then writing a code to make updates for several tables from that. I don't say it is easy. But it seems to be possible to do. If you have time and resources. But yeah, I agree with you, that for now we have ORMs for simple stuff and bulkcopy/sprocs for heavy operations.
This is so true. Sometimes when I'm really struggling, my senior takes over and starts coding really fast. At that time I always ask him to stop, because I don't understand and it's happening too fast. This way I can't learn anything, so I prefer just some small hints or tips so at least I won't be stuck for 5 hours on something 'simple'
Blue is probably a reverted change, yellow an unsaved change and green a saved addition
I have a degree in game design and development. So although I don't have actual coding experience, I did came familiar with some code logic. I used Unreal Engine mainly and worked with visual coding. The company were willing to hire me, because they lack (young) developers. They were willing to hire someone that was willing to learn from scratch. So kind of like an investment on long term. Their apps look really bad because they don't have a designer. I did a lot of design work, so they thought if they hired me, I could as well help with front as well as back-end development. They also lack females in their IT department. I think all those things combined made them hire me. However, the fact that I'm a woman makes me even more stressful, because I just don't want people to not take me seriously and think 'yeah, she can't do shit cuz she's a woman'. Hence, trying hard to prove myself. Again, this could just be me and the overthinking. Haha
I've got a small rubberduck on my desk and I talk to it whenever I don't understand something (not out loud)
Use a `bool` to store whether or not you found it, then output the result: bool foundName = false; int foundIndex = -1; for (int i = 0; i &lt; arr2.Length; i++) { if (arr2[i] == a) { foundName = true; foundIndex = i; } } if (foundName) { Console.WriteLine(a + "found at index: " + foundIndex); } else { Console.WriteLine(a + "was not found"); }

As @FizixMax also stated, you can use a bool to indicate when you have found a value, and use the break keyword to exit the loop when you find your search target. One issue I've noticed in your code is what you do with the ReadLine method: int a = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine()); This code will take whatever you get from the console, and convert it to a number (int). So when you later make your comparison: &gt; if (arr2[i] == a) You have essentially written: &gt; if ("name" == number) And thus, your if statement will never find the correct name. You probably want to just read whatever user input you receive directly into a string instead: string a = Console.ReadLine();
Makes sense now, thanks for clarifying. Btw, any recommendations on learning UI design? One guy told me that good practice is to try and copy a good looking site 
Linq2db has bulk copy: https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db
To format code properly on Reddit: - Have an empty line between text and code. - Indent every line of code by 4 spaces.
A few suggestions: * Indent your code (in notepad++ or some other text editor) with 4 tabs before posting on reddit. Like this: if (arr2[i] == a) { Console.WriteLine(a) + "found at index: " + i); } * Use [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/) to post full program snippets. About your code: `int a = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine())` will read an integer from the console whenever you call it. However, `arr2` is an array of strings. What you want, is simply `string input = Console.ReadLine()` which will read a string. And then you can compare it like this:`arr2[i] == input`. You want to put the `Console.ReadLine()` statement before the loop if you want to use it in a loop - so the user will be prompted to enter the name before the loop starts. &gt; My else statement is written out multiple times, That is because it prints not found every time the loop is executed. You need to think of a way for that line to print only if a match was not found. 
Or use the newfangled layout which has very handy buttons to do exactly that.
&gt; which goes far beyond the last line in file, for some reason The view scrolls just enough so that the last line of the file hits the top row. That way the last few lines of your file aren't always stuck at the bottom of your screen. 
First open source GitHub project uploaded with a license, code of conduct, PR template and a README? Unheard of.. Any reason as to why you chose GPL v3 instead of MIT/Apache that most .NET OSS projects use now? 
You could try asking on Telerik's forums
Mhm I can't seem to find a Get-UnifiedGroup similarity or anything... so I don't think it's possible? I tried executing it in by running Powershell in C# (figure out how to run as admin/circumvent it now), but it says "the term Get-UnifiedGroup is not recognized"... etc. I've installed modules MSOnline and AzureAD, and connect to Microsoft.Exchange in my script so I don't know why it's not running now :\ . Funny thing is, it runs in powershell shell, but not in visual studio running powershell...
FYI you can install Entity Framework Plus (looks like some work was done to move it to a new library called Entity Framework Classic) which supports batch delete and update.
Hey! Glad I could help :b Cheers! 
You own the code, so of course changing the license means that you simply edit the file. MIT vs GPL is my personal opinion though. For bigger projects, it is harder to change licenses when developers feel that GPL/LGPL/AGPL are too restrictive. About the other changes (that I linked to in the post) - if you intend for your software to be used for a long time, instead of a temporary tool, then looking into .NET Core 3.0 and a cross platform UI framework right now would be worth it.
It looks like it's HTML, maybe the colors switch depending on the language you're in. Like JavaScript inline has a different color. Idk, seems very weird and useless though.
Thanks, That was really helpful :) 
Narrator? I think Windows+Enter.
Also, the icons are a bit confusing for first time users. I'd suggest using standard icons - at least until your editor has more features to make better icons in the editor itself ;)

Yeah, I know, I'll do this for sure
Yeah, I mean you can return any type in an async method with Task&lt;T&gt; essentially. At first I saw hagerino's response to me earlier comment and was confused. I guess not everyone knows about Task&lt;T&gt;.
First, a few suggestions: * Follow the C# naming guidelines. Public properties follow PascalCasing - `PlayerLevel`, `StatMultiplier`, etc. while private fields follow camelCasing, i.e., `playerLevel`. * Public fields are not recommended (just add `{get; set;}` and make your public fields properties). &gt; An object reference is required for the non-static field, method, or property Where is the code that causes this error? 
 public class Character { public int health; public int Health { get{ health += Convert.ToInt32(health * Player.Statmultiplier); return health; } set{health = value;} } public int damage; public int mitigation; public Character(int givenHealth, int givenDamage, int givenMitigation) { this.health = givenHealth; this.damage = givenDamage; this.mitigation = givenMitigation; } } sorry about that this was the code that was causing the issue. the get - set for the variable Health and I'll look into that naming guidelines
Maybe two (sets of\*) questions per day or something like that. But the key thing I want to note is that there is no resentment in having to answer her questions. \*The questions come in bursts, where she might have one question that leads to another, or she'll have saved up a set. Her technique appears to be that when she has a question, she records it and treats it like a blockage, then explores another avenue until her ignorance blocks her again. When she has no further idea how to proceed, she comes to me. This technique pretty much works because the main goal we have for her now is transferring domain knowledge. In the completion of any given task, she might take much longer than would a more experienced developer, but at the end, the task gets done AND she's learned X, Y, and Z about the domain. Now it's possible that your employer or immediate supervisor doesn't take such a long view and their expectations are different. Are you getting any vibes from them like that? Have you talked to them about how you're doing?
monogame would be an easy/simple way of making a game
ok thats good to hear, I'm a junior as well and I ask questions constantly and feel like I'm learning at a light speed pace but I sometimes worry I ask too much. Im not that worried because my senior seems to like me as a person (they tell me about all sorts of personal stuff or tech stuff) so i know im not too annoying but it is on tje back of my mind.
You can't access `Player` from `Character`. Update stats like this: public class Player { private int _experience = 0; public int Experience { get =&gt; _experience; set { _experience = value; UpdateStats(); } } public int Level { get; set; } = 0; public double StatMultiplier { get; set; } = 1; public Character Character { get; set; } = new Character(100, 10, 5); public Player(Character character, int experience) { Character = character; Experience = experience; } private void UpdateStats() { // example logic below, replace with your own logic Level = _experience * 5; StatMultiplier = _experience * 10; Character.Damage = (int) Math.Round(Character.Damage * StatMultiplier); Character.Health = (int) Math.Round(Character.Health * StatMultiplier); Character.Shield = (int) Math.Round(Character.Shield * StatMultiplier); } } public class Character { public int Health { get; set; } = 100; public int Damage { get; set; } = 10; public int Shield { get; set; } = 5; public Character(int health, int damage, int shield) { Health = health; Damage = damage; Shield = shield; } }
You have to run VS as admin.
For now, you can save as PNG, but in future maybe there will be more. Also, I will make a webpage, but not in current stage.
If you are wanting a popup up, though, use the MessageBox class? [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.messagebox?view=netframework-4.7.2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.messagebox?view=netframework-4.7.2)
You are being too naive. Software companies, especially those working in the financial industry or work with the Federal government, usually have a whitelist and blacklist for what 3rd party software can be used. How 3rd party software ends up on those lists is determined by a number of factors, not the least of which being the licensing involved, how secure it is and the level of confidence in its quality. Each 3rd party software, then, needs to meet not only the company's compliamce standards, but the compliance standards set forth by their clients AND government regulations. The financial industry, goverment agencies etc. are known to be notoriously slow when adopting newer software technologies *because* of all of the red tape. Everyone knows Microsoft -- the vast majority of users on github/bitbucket/etc. are unknown.
You know you misspelled **goverment**. It's actually spelled **government**. Don't let me catch you misspelling words again!
None of which you said applies to OP who is looking for an ORM with X feature and if not - why cant he find it. So what is your point?
Okay, I see! Well first of all, check this, because it's real, and you might be in the middle of it: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome Then, may I ask what programming language you use? Finally, what are the general classes of questions you're having? If that's mostly basic things that they feel you should have done at University, that could explain your colleagues grumpiness. If you describe what you're struggling with most and most often, we can build a self-study curriculum that could potentially eliminate/answer 90% of your questions.

/u/Grasher134 said: &gt; When something is not open source or not created by respected company I can't include it into my client's app. As it is a huge risk. and you said: &gt; and waste your companies time rebuilding the wheel over and over since that isnt risky. What is risky is going to be determined by the company and the level of risk, if it exists, is largely subjective. You said yourself that trusting Microsoft's QA process is "risky" but then suggested that some unknown user on github supporting an unknown codebase isn't risky. Yes, Microsoft has screwed some things up in the past but they do have an incredibly thorough QA process. More to the point, unless /u/Grasher134 has authority when it comes to determining what is and is not risky from the company's perspective, he simply *can't* use certain software applications that isn't approved. This is why I said what I said. 
If you can supply any type of sketch, I'd happily volunteer to do the website since there aren't many good open source pixel art editors and I got nothing else to do 
I recommend this book to anyone who is starting their career. It has specific advice for the questions you are asking. Best of all it's available for free in pdf http://www.simecr.it/new/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Apprenticeship-Patterns-Guidance-for-the-Aspiring-Software-Craftsman.pdf
You are missing the entire point and context of a conversation you are derailing. I didn't suggest as you wrongly keep assuming that he should go blindly into the night or trust anyone - especially blindly trust Microsoft. I recommended a solution that works based on my experience. I then told him to test the software and read the source for himself on Github. There is no risk if you read the code, understand the code, and test the functionality/code yourself. If code is popular or unpopular, it has zero outcome on how accurate or reliable the library is. A popular well known devloper can make mistakes and an anonymous developer might write perfect code. Also, most projects have open source licenses that labor the point, the author is not responsible for any damage. You are. You. You have to put on the big boy pants and do the big boy research and testing. OP doesnt give the impression he is doing that because he solely relies on first party libraries only for their QA. Despite asking for options. What's risky is always assuming you will know more than all other developers always so you always write your own solution. Meanwhile the library author is scoped to that one specific thing which isnt a guarantee it's good but they probably will do a better job than you by simply not being limited to time as we are in a regular jon. Another thing is to blindly trust anyone - especially Microsoft - is risky. I felt compelled to point out all the fallacies OP maybe using. But we aren't even on topic / in the discussion anymore so I am stopping this discussion.
So the blue line means you can't cross into the zone before the puck does... oh crap, wrong subreddit. As you were..
Sure, why not. Check your PM.
u/Shabushi is right. I use the dark theme; basically the blue means "you changed this, then changed it back to the way it was before." So if you change a line, it will be yellow. Once you save that change, it will be green. Then if you hit undo ("reverting" the change) it will be blue (but in other themes orange). Hit save and all the blue will disappear.
Tortuga Chain can for inserts in SQL Server. I haven't gotten around to adding the PostgreSQL, but I will if anyone asks me to. 
Lots of subjective and unrelated opinions, ignoring *my* point, and a clear sign of anger and frustration on your part with a hint of control issues. Cool.
I use FixedDocument in my application: https://medium.com/@therealchrisrutherford/c-wpf-and-fixed-documents-lets-talk-printing-e7742bfecae1
Your NotifyableObject can do with some reflection love. You can use CallerMemberName as opposed to passing in "magic" strings when calling RaisePropertyChanged as follows: protected void RaisePropertyChanged([CallerMemberName] string property = "") { if (property != null) { PropertyChanged(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(property)); } } Your usage when then look like this : public WriteableBitmap LayerBitmap { get { return _layerBitmap; } set { _layerBitmap = value; RaisePropertyChanged(); } } You can read more about it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.compilerservices.callermembernameattribute?view=netframework-4.7.2)
It is just a file... it doesn't really \*have to be added to the project, as long as the program know the path of the data file. Anyways. the file is "[iris.data](https://iris.data)", it is a ".data" file, and specifically probably a special file format for tutorial and not a known file format. If you really want to add it to the project, at least in VS2017, just right click on the project or a folder in the project and click "Add -&gt; Existing Item" and just select the file and it will be in the project. If you want the file outputted to the bin\\Release (or bin\\Debug) folder when you build the project, just right click the file in the solution and change "Copy to Output Directory" to something else other than "Do Not Copy". Keep the "Build Action" to content, as you do want the compiler to try to compile it. You can add any file to a solution, as the solution is just an organized set of files/projects.
No that's the kind of feedback I'm looking for, you're right. The issue I guess is that we've tried to find ERM software and it just didn't fit with a lot of the tools we already had. For us, we schedule and assign resources to every task (we're a manufacturing company) down to the line. So a "job" will have like 500 tasks, with a different department, whether it's a guy welding or a guy running conduit or whatever, so we can see "oh the electrical department is way over capacity this week". We also mark off what was ordered and what has arrived and stuff like that. I really couldn't find software that was all-encompassing and did this well. Not to mention it would be great if we could take our estimates and just import them into the system, which...me being familiar with our estimates and how they work, I could probably do that. I suppose another option is just hiring a dedicated company to create custom software for us, but yeah. I'm kinda spitballing too, so feel free to spitball back at me.
The C# idea is probably not ideal. It's a big project (pun intended). Project scales well, and for teams you can use "Project server" which is based on Sharepoint. I've no idea of the cost, but I imagine you'll fall between the Project is too small and Server is too expensive extremes :/ I'd see what /u/revlayle was looking at. Perhaps consider a web based app, but remember you're fcked if their website or your internet goes down. 
&gt; is possible but it is a bit trickier and, in some flows, would require a web server to receive the oauth callback. Of course, you can do If the program I want authentication on a a windows app, is it possible to integrate a mvc web app to authenticate it?
Or go even farther and just use [https://github.com/Fody/PropertyChanged](https://github.com/Fody/PropertyChanged), then keep your normal auto properties and not even worry about writing a ton of manual properties.
You don't "integrate" the MVC app as I understand you to mean this. The web app is separate and exists to receive the oauth token via a callback. There is also a "password flow" where you simply supply a name/password. This is not really considered a very secure flow. I simply don't know what you mean by JS widget or API calls. It could mean a lot of different things. 
I guess I should look into sharepoint/project server. But then I'll need a programming project BECAUSE I'M AN EMPTY SHELL OF A MAN WITHOUT ONE. Hah. Thanks for the response.
Never mind. I thought this was the /r/learnprogramming sub
I think what you need is PowerShell. You can import your DLL into PowerShell and run the functions from there. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7972141/run-my-third-party-dll-file-with-powershell &gt;One step further, it would be really nice to be able to use VS Code in this fashion.. where I can just load up my .csx, and run the script right from vscode, so I can use intellisense / code completion stuff from vscode VSCode has PowerShell integration.
Thanks a lot for the input. Luckily we just have one plant/office location so it'll all be the same time zone. And yeah if I've learned one thing from other projects, it's that everything(ish) is doable, and not necessarily HARD, but takes about 5x longer than expected. I did a few "freelance" projects for work, and they all took longer than I hoped. Luckily I worked out with the president of the company that my outside work will be $40/hr, so even if I take twice as long, it's not bad. I guess the trick, if I decide to go forward with this, will be to determine what makes the most sense financially to propose. Guessing how many hours it will take, and even convincing them that it's a worthwhile endeavor. Which I think it is and there are a lot of selling points, but change is really hard to get going at this place. But I sure hope I can sell it to them, because the experience would be great, and of course I'd make some money.
Another option you could explore is finding an existing open source solution and extending it to more closely fit the company's needs; that would likely take significantly less time and effort, but still give you experience.
Why go through all this effort when you can just use GUID COMBS or UUIDS? Seems like a GUID-Comb would be enough for you. They too are based on current ticks, and are incremental. Most ORMs/DBs can create Id's for you automatically. EF can make incremental longs or GUIDCombs and Mongo can make UUID Object Ids which are like GuidCombs but 4 bytes smaller. 
You could learn Sharepoint development although it, too, will make you an empty shell of a man... TBH while this is possible in C# it's the kind of project that would take a team of 5+ developers several months to a year to complete unless you do a very niche, restrictive implementation of the existing solution. This sounds like your goal is to move (your team? your company?) off MS project so you'll have to talk to many people using the tool today and see how *they* use it. Are there custom reports they review? Do they pull schedule data into Excel? You'll have to decide whether to re-implement those features in your new tool or not (potentially pissing off your coworkers lol) If you're looking for a task to keep your mind and programming skills sharp, you could start with considering whether there are tasks you can automate *in MS Project* and build C#/powershell tools to do it using the APIs https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/project/project-2013-developer-documentation https://stackoverflow.com/questions/153593/programmatically-access-a-microsoft-project-mpp-file-from-c-sharp
I need to look into this. Thanks for the heads-up
Interesting read! I really enjoyed how you worked through each step one at a time with modified code in each step to show your thought process. One thing: The very last results box (using the String.Create function) does not have anything in it :(
Hmmm, I haven't really looked into automating things in MS Project. As far as how others use it though, honestly, they hardly use it, which is problematic, because stuff gets missed. But the combination of one person being in at a time, how ridiculously long and unintuitively filtered it is, and how long it takes to open, kind of keeps people from making good use of it. Basically...I use it, and our production people begrudgingly mark off tasks when they complete them, and purchasing marks things off when they order something. It's really not in a state that people use it for themselves to actually help them. I don't know, this whole place feels like everything is out of date and they really don't tailor things to actually help themselves...they do everything the wrong way, double and sometimes triple enter information into multiple places, and...yeah. Part of our issue is that our accounting software doesn't play nice with ANYTHING. Even the ERP people we were pinging just could not make their stuff work with our accounting stuff, and they claim to be able to work with any accounting software. Maybe if I can make programs that extract information from the schedule it could be more useful. Though it still won't solve the problem of people not being able to edit informatino without opening the whole deal. &amp;#x200B; More rambling, sorry. Thanks again for the information.
I'd like to see a comparison of this against `Guid.NewGuid().ToString("n")` - although while not mentioned it does look like half of what this approach is about is generating sequential time-based IDs.
Thanks for reporting, should be fixed now.
That will be the next blog post but I can tell you now it will be a lot slower, stay tuned for the details.
That’s not C# 😂
C'est la vie.
Do not forget the pasta code! I have not heard of such a tool. Is it used for linux?
What are we talking about here? Web pages? Windows Forms? WPF?
Are you trying to send src from a client to the server, have the server compile that source and then execute it? That is quite insecure isn't it? Or are you trying to access new functionality on the server from the client without the client being recompiled? 
Sure, can you provide me with the finalized benchmark code with all the spin lock and stuff? I see you made a few changes from the first example and I don't have time to reapply those changes for a quick test. 
Ran the bench mark code with your approach and with a simple GuidComb approach. Guid Comb results: &gt; Execution time: 00:03:50.5820362 - Gen-0: 9233, Gen-1: 23, Gen-2: 2 So your approach is indeed faster! I'm surprised that MS hasn't made Guid Generation more performant. Although I can't forsee a time where I would ever generate this high of a number of ids in such a short period of time, I do concede that your approach is much faster than the built in guid generation. 
I've used it and it seems to work well :) I've also found some extension methods in the past for linq2sql.
First of all wrapping a web app in web view is not optimal user experience thats why most people properly invest on making a native mobile app. Second good luck passing it by the review process of Apple. Now if you are a .net dev it might be worthwhile to check Xamarin. It would be kinda easy to get going. Check Mvvm Cross too if you need a framework to help you out or ReactiveUi if you are into Rx. For the push notifications i didnt catch exactly what is your question? If you have a web app and want to send from there push notifications to the mobile app you can. Its just a post service in the end after setting up a firebase project and some code in the client for registering tokens!
Doesn’t support what exactly? I have done push notifications on several Xamarin cross platform apps. The client registers a token, you send it to the server and then from a web app with some ui you post the push.
Total meh. Guids are much more reliable and only 2.3x slower on my machine (still over 3M/sec). Why bother? Here's the benchmark: https://dotnetfiddle.net/KcvKxL

Haha, well with Project Server, and probably with Project you can program against their API's. I'm not sure about Project, I sort of assume it has an API like the rest of the Office apps, but it's the ginger step child of the group really.
RoslynPad uses the same Roslyn scripting API that the C# REPL uses, as well as other tools like [scriptcs](http://scriptcs.net/) which might up your alley. I suspect the main roadblock you're facing is that the `#r $NuGet` part is proprietary. The Roslyn API only handles `#r` directives to local DLLs, RoslynPad does some magic on top of that to automatically install packages from NuGet.
&gt; First of all wrapping a web app in web view is not optimal user experience thats why most people properly invest on making a native mobile app. Sorry mate but that's old school thinking and just plain wrong. It completely depends on the app an what you're trying to accomplish. Having built both native and packaged web apps, frameworks like Ionic do a wonderful job of package apps up.
You wouldn't have been running react native in a webview on android. React Native should been installed and ran just like a native app. Do yourself a favor and run [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) or [Infinite Red's Ignite Generator](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite). Its the superiors solution imo.
&gt; &gt; Fresh and untrained eyes also help identify things that are easier or harder to understand in the code (which are very hard to spot once you get deeply familiar with it) as well as where documentation is inadequate (assuming you even have any). &gt; Agreed. Even better is to get the newbie to write the missing docs then have you review them. They remember the material better and will put more focus on documenting what was less obvious from the perspective of a newbie.
Some operating systems are built around web apps. And all [major operating systems have preliminary support](https://debuggerdotbreak.judahgabriel.com/2018/04/13/i-built-a-pwa-and-published-it-in-3-app-stores-heres-what-i-learned/) for [progressive web apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) (PWAs) which pretty much eliminates the requirement to even package the app in an apk. 
I always split my app up so all business logic lives in a class that in my controller and the data repository gets injected into that. I leave the controller to only handle the HTTP bits and leave the logic in this other class so that it's easier to write tests for it.
&gt; I'm having trouble understanding if it's possible to do from a web app on mobile devices? All major browsers on macOS, Windows and Android support [Web Notifications API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API) while [Push API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API ) is supported on all major browsers on Android and Windows. Safari has a [custom implementation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/NotificationProgrammingGuideForWebsites/PushNotifications/PushNotifications.html) for push notifications on macOS. iOS Safari supports none of the 3. So yes, unfortunately you cannot have the same PWA published to iOS/macOS and Android/Windows because they do not support a lot of modern Web APIs. So you would need some kind of a native wrapper until Apple adds support for the APIs. Compatibility Chart: * [Notifications API](https://caniuse.com/#feat=notifications) * [Push API](https://caniuse.com/#feat=push-api) &gt; wrap my web application in a webview You are describing a [progressive web application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Progressive ). [Windows](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/pwa), [Android](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) and [iOS](https://medium.com/@firt/progressive-web-apps-on-ios-are-here-d00430dee3a7 ) support PWAs in some form. Again, these are limited by Apple's restrictions on iOS and can't do any kind of notifications. 
No thanks I researched both React Native and Xamarin and found Xamarin to be superior. Mainly because the component based approach gets confusing too fast when your app increases in complexity.
Push notifications via a web application. As far as I can google, ios doesn't support this. I'd like to avoid using Xamarin if possible to save time.
Having worked on something close to scheduling before, a piece of advice: Save everything in UTC. Every date, without exception. With each user’s account, use location services to discover their current location offset from UTC, to modify the on-screen display of the times appropriately. With this, someone putting a start time for a conference can put in “9am local time” for that conference, and a user two time zones away will see two times: that which is for the conference’s physical location and another for its value in their current time zone (in brackets) so they can have a temporally local reference to work from. Or vice versa, if the conference is remotely accessed and not physically visited.
Would it be possible to install an app that simply runs as a service in the background and does push notifications via a web api, then you can run the web app in a browser and still receive push notifications?
Just use a guid... just use a guid. It'll be ok- 20 years I've heard all the arguments and none of them turned out to be an issue.
I responded below with some explanation around this. 1) Then you need to either package up your existing app (provided it's a SPA - html, css, js) or build a cross-platform app using either client-side tech e.g. Angular / React + Ionic 4, React Native or use Xamarin to build a new cross platform native app with .NET. 2) A packaged web app built with the tools above will allow you to do this. E.g. I just finished a project that consisted of Angular &amp; Ionic (Ionic lets you use native phone functionality) with a .NET back-end. In that app we used the camera and GPS. You have one code base and then just compile the code to generate an Android or iOS app. The important questions here is, what did you build your front end with? If it's an SPA then you're about 80% of the way there already and you just need to use the right tools allow you to use native phone APIs (e.g camera). If you built the whole project in MVC with a Razor front end or something like that then you're out of luck and see 1 above. If you give me more detail, I can help point you in the right direction. For reference, I've over 10 years of experience in software, been CTO of a successful start up, people leader, cloud architect etc.
App complexity isn't an argument against components. It's an argument for components. Creating small reusable building blocks that you can add anywhere quickly and easily saves a ton of work. You can do that with any library whether it be a web app or a mobile app. You even do the same thing building your api. Things are broken down into smaller units of work and then stitched together so things are more readable, usable, and testable. 
There's a great Stack Overflow thread about the possibility of guids colliding. 
I already posted a top level comment, but I just wanted to reiterate that /u/tinbuddychrist is absolutely right. And I also want to extend the offer that if you ever have specific questions, feel free to PM me as well. If I don't know the answer I'll at least try to help you find resources to help.
i think i read somewhere that the chance for a bitflip in ram is several orders of magnitude higher than having a guid collision
This. OneNote is incredibly useful. I take my laptop to every meeting and keep my notes in OneNote. You can even send stuff from other MS Office apps to OneNote, like emails, spreadsheets, word documents, etc. It's so useful!
please correct the following line: &amp;#x200B; \&gt; This is how the that version would look like: &amp;#x200B; it gave me a stroke XD &amp;#x200B; i guess you do not want to get down to IL levels to see if you can make it faster there? XD
My general approach has been to use a service layer for business logic. The service layer would generally sit in its own project and have the DbContext injected into it for database work. 
Do you use automated tests?
But guid are not sequential, which might be a requirement. While I can agree that OP's solution might be a bit overkill for a simple task like id generation, it's always interesting to better understand how things work behind the hood, and I will never disagree with performance optimization. Too often, devs run awfully non optimized code and then throw hardware at the problem when they don't understand why their software use &gt; 40% CPU Now I get that at work, we probably don't have time to optimize code this much but the good news is: we don't have to, people like OP already did :)
exactly. service-oriented-architecture.
Checking if the value has changed before raising the event is also a good practice: you don't want to raise events for now reason + it can prevent some infinite loop in case you have properties changing based on other properties changing. For an example of a `ViewModelBase` implementation you can have a look at the Xenko project (that I contribute to): - [ViewModelBase.cs](https://github.com/xenko3d/xenko/blob/master/sources/presentation/Xenko.Core.Presentation/ViewModel/ViewModelBase.cs) - [DispatcherViewModel.cs](https://github.com/xenko3d/xenko/blob/master/sources/presentation/Xenko.Core.Presentation/ViewModel/DispatcherViewModel.cs) for a "dispatcher-safe" version Feel free to grab part of the file(s) as the license is also MIT (provided you keep the header and copyright notice intact as per the license).
the business logic 'services' should be separate itself from the controllers/web server layer. typically these are injected as interfaced services into the controller via DI. this keep the application's business logic loosely coupled from any top layer (winforms ui, wpf ui, http rest apis, console app). if done correctly, you should be able to use the application by plugging in the business logic into one of these end-user-interactive frameworks and they should be able to be swapped out with another.
We are still in an early phase, where we are trying to determine the best way to develop the app. We haven't started coding yet. As I mentioned we are two .NET developers with decent experience in .NET MVC (web apps/rest api's). We would prefer being able to build it as a web app in that framework, without having to use Xamarin fx. The problem is we need the camera functionality and push notifications to work on iOS and Android phones. 
If you google it and read various developer opinions, there's a lot of complaining about keeping track of your logic, because of the component based system. Either way we have a strong C# background, so if we're going to build a cross platform app we will use Xamarin.
Your web application needs to just send notifications via FCM. 
I believe we'll encounter the heat death of the universe before we see a natural guid collision
You still have said *how* you're building the front end, specifically. Are you using a framework like Angular, React, Vue etc? Is the back-end a completely separate application e.g. .NET web api? You can't build a regular .NET MVC app (e.g. with the front end in Razor) as a cross-platform mobile app without using Xamarin.
Very similar setup broken up into very similar 5 projects. Project: Api + Web Models Versioned Controllers Web Only Helpers Project: Services Business Layer Logging Project: Data Layer Repositories Database + Cache Project: Non Web Models / Domain ORM Models Project: Utilities Extra methods/common helpers. Miscellaneous features such as serializers/compressors. Enums. Factories. Project: Tests UnitTests Integrations Functional
&gt; which might be a requirement. Yup, that'd be different- and if that's the case and your db (or whatever) has a generator/sequence facility, then use it. The wonderful part of the guid, that most people don't get, is the freedom from having to ask a central authority for an id.
I refer you to my previous remarks re:20 years.
Well we usually use razor, jquery etc. which is already in the standard web app project as you create it. Then add whatever we need on top of that. As far as I know you can't use Razor in Xamarin? It uses XAML.
Onion Architecture always made the most sense to me. With that, most (if not all) of your business logic goes into the Service layer.
Yes for distributed systems it is fantastic but if you don't have that requirement, GUID quite frankly sux for DBs. My fav in that situation without a doubt is long or int identity keys depending on how many rows are expected to be inserted.
You can use Razor templates with Xamarin: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/cross-platform/platform/razor-html-templates/ Ok so sounds like you're building a regular MVC web app w/ Razor. If you want to use Razor anywhere in your code then your only option is to work with Xamarin. That's it. With Xamarin you need a UI code base for Android and another for iOS, as the link above shows. The other option you have (as I mentioned earlier) is to build the front end part of the app using **only** html, css and js (no .NET, no Razor) and communicate with your back end over HTTP calls. If you do this and decide to use a javascript framework like Angular (and you really should) to build your app, then you can use that with other client side tools like Ionic that let you make use of the camera and other phone hardware and generate iOS and Android apps. It seems like you don't have much client side experience or know much about hybrid / cross platform apps. If you're not prepared to use a client side, javascript framework to build the front end of your app, just use Xamarin. For context, here's an example of using push notifications in a iOS/Android app built with Angular + Ionic. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOOjamH1bAA
As an EE, you may be interested in some DSP. Here's one project that might be fun, and should be relatively "pure". &amp;#x200B; Program one is a player/renderer for sound files of a peculiar as-yet-nonexistent format (call them SoundGraph files). The format has two chunks: chunk 1 describes what signal processing elements (mixers, filters, oscillators...) are used and how they are connected, and chunk 2 describes the inputs to these elements (maybe just constants, or maybe time-varying signals that are sampled at a very low rate, with like linear interpolation between samples). Program two takes as input a conventional sound file (.wav, .mp3, ...) and then tries to approximate it with a SoundGraph file. In all likelihood, the approximation won't be perfect, and that's fine- it will be an interesting variation on the original file. One could imagine finding this approximation with, say, stochastic search attempting to minimize the difference between the original FFT and that of the approximation (ignoring phase, which is for suckas). &amp;#x200B; \----------- &amp;#x200B; Alternatively, you could make something that will help you understand new codebases. Here's how. When a .NET project is compiled in Debug mode, it doesn't just generate .dll and .exe files; it also generates files containing debug symbols. These little guys can be loaded with the help of a library called Mono.Cecil. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to make something that reads in these files to produce useful information about the projects in a solution. One idea for this is to make a graph representing the projects, with nodes for \* Assemblies \* Types \* Type members (fields, properties, events, methods) \* IL Statements (the statements inside method bodies) And connect these nodes with arcs that denote their relationships (types are defined in assemblies and have members and members have IL statements in their bodies, IL statements can invoke methods, etc.) Once you have this graph, you can do some interesting things with it. For example, you can use a graph centrality algorithm to assign a centrality value to each node; the highest-centrality nodes should have particular importance in the codebase. Or, given a starting method and a target method, find possible paths of execution (just methods and IL statements) that connect the two methods.
this is the right answer. I am working on a project right now where I am upgrading a project to .net core and the previous developers decided to abstract all the business logic into its own class library with interfaces and a seperate class library for the database provider seperate from the WCF API they made it for. I could fucking kiss them if they weren't all sweaty russians.
[eshoponcontainers](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eshoponcontainers) is a huge project which might be a bit too complex, but its little brother [eShopOnWeb](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnWeb ) is a single ASP.NET Core application that has the folder/project structure you would want to use. 
&gt; And you would be right; Both Gen-0 and Gen-1 collections are fast but unlike the Gen-2 collections, they are blocking; That implies gen-0 is blocking and I've always read that gen-0 is not blocking...
...holy crap, my mind is blown. I had no idea you could call code from another project in the same solution that wasn't a class library. I knew you could add a reference to a dll compiled from a class library inside the soultion... But I did not know you could add projects as references. I've copied so many "Utilities" and "Logging" .cs files over the years.... This is so cool
I always tell beginners to create a mortgage amortization calculator. Bonus points if you can build it in asp.net core and use Vue.
Please do not reuse project over multiple solutions. Create a nuget package if you need to share it.
If you need sequential IDs, just use sequential guids.
Wow. That's such an elegant implementation. I solved this yesterday and thought I needed to use a dictionary. Thanks for showing me the better way!

Why would you do that to be honest? I mean Windows has a built-in feature to sort files.
mono/dotnet core is what you need. but ui is disturbing part...
Post some useful description which interest readers in one impression about technologies instead of posting links.
Are they mutually exclusive. Do you get .NET Core when you install Mono? Are you familiar with GTK+ and do you know whether adopting it could be a working solution?
mono is for projects equivalent to .net 4* when .net core is the latest implementation, which is multiplatform and opensource. Gtk/Qt might help you with UI, but why not go with web application?
*Might* be preferable to roll up multiple errors to an You could get more flexibility by removing the type parameter and adding a `Func&lt;Exception, bool&gt;` parameter, for something like T RetryIfThrown&lt;T&gt;( Func&lt;T&gt; action, Func&lt;Exception, bool&gt; errorFilter, int numberOfRetries, int delayInMilliseconds ) { var errors = new List&lt;Exception&gt;(); for (var i = 0; i &lt; numberOfRetries; i++) { try { return action(); } catch (Exception e) when (errorFilter(e)) { errors.Add(e); } Thread.Sleep(delayInMilliseconds); } throw new AggregateException(errors).Flatten(); }
Thanks. Maybe someday I'll figure out how to do the Leetcode medium and hard problems. :-/
do you mean that if i install Mono, I will not get .NET core? In that case, what is an IDE I can replace Mono with?
Mono is not an IDE, it is an implementation of .net that runs on linux. dotnet core will run on linux regardless since you can ship the runtime with your app. The latest version of mono supports dotnet core 2.0 fully so you should have no issues there. On the other hand, GTK+ has a wrapper called gtk-sharp and now has full support in Xamarin.Forms 3.2. The is also [picoe/eto](https://github.com/picoe/Eto) which allows you to build your UI once for Winforms, WPF or GTK. If you are going for a desktop app, this is the route to go.
They aren't actually C# questions, right? It looks like general algorithms or puzzles.
thank you so much for the answers!
mono is not IDE. you can have both without issues, but there are differences in development for .net core with mono/.net. so first define what are you developing and select proper runtime for it...
I recently came on board with a company that has not been following best practices. So I’ve been having to separate out the business logic into a service layer for them. It’s been tedious as all hell. But hey, that’s why I get paid the medium bucks lol. 
No worries
Why would we do that, as opposed to use OP's solution? To create sequential guids, you probably have to write more code than what OP wrote in his article. And it probably is far less performant. 
That is sexy as hell. Thanks!
mobile client is not showing other persons responses... missed this one.
&gt;I could fucking kiss them WCF API... If the client was an ASP.NET app this is the cancer that plagued .NET for decades because of that stupid article on MSDN back in the day that said you should put a service between your BL and Web layers (and thus turn them into tiers)
If you use a db, yes, you should probably use whatever the db engine offers you. The not so wonderful part of guid is their size. 16 bytes as opposed to 4 bytes for a long. Say you have 1B records like OP, it's nearly 15GB only to keep an ID. All in all, it all comes down to your context and why you want an ID. I cannot say that one is better than the other, it all depends on what your are trying to accomplish.
Some bullshit in this project too. For example in this class they pull a bunch of data from the database just to get the count and then they only get a small amount of that data to show on the page with paging - https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnWeb/blob/master/src/Web/Services/CatalogService.cs I think you can easily blame using var here. When you read the code it feels like it gets an IQueryable but in reality it is an IEnumerable.
Will do... Setting up an internal nuget server right now. Also didn't know you could do this - I never really thought about it before
Quick'n'dirty - https://repl.it/repls/InvolvedScarceTasks (uses https://stackoverflow.com/a/3563872/3248515 for guid-long conversion). This is overall probably easier with BigInteger.
Why not?
Or you could just learn your shit inside and out :) 
I did an interview yesterday that involved some C#. I felt that reading a book about the basics (Pro C# in my case) was very effective in giving me enough information to speak to C# and .Net to their satisfaction. I think the only question they asked I wasn’t sure about was the null coalesce operator. Mostly just basic questions about Linq, collections, classes and inheritance, abstract vs sealed classes, stuff like that. Reading the book, which took maybe 12 hours total, felt much more helpful than studying random “interview questions”. 
That's not a direct replacement. You can be acing a class and still want the study guide for the final. 
Nice. Might want to also take a look at Polly [https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly) which includes Retry, Circuit-Breaker, Fallback, ...
Isn't that what language-specific technical questions are though? 
No, language *specific* questions are about features of the language, e.g. "Using LINQ, ..."
Too bad I'm seeing this now. Just faced an interview for a .NET dev post yesterday.
Package dependencies of project A inherited by referencing project B should not be top level dependency of project A. Package B referenced by package A only need to be a top level dependency if you want some fix/feature from a never version of package B than the one package A references. 
I guess this won't help you directly, but it might be of *some* help. I can't answer when you should or shouldn't use transitive references, but I recently learned that only one of the two different ASP.NET metapackages can be used implicitly (Microsoft.AspNetCore.All is not transitive, (Microsoft.AspNetCore.App is). It was a problem for me when I tried to experiment with a different kind of solution architecture and the external references would be in one Core project, the only one which other projects could reference (not each other). I read on docs.microsoft.com somewhere (sorry I can't look it up, but I'm on mobile) that one of the packages contain third party libs they have no control over, the other does not. So I guess you can consider these two things (at least): - whether you want to enable transitive dependencies in a project structure - how much control you have over all transitive dependencies. Another thing that comes to mind are analyzer packages, which probably should be scoped to the first dependant project only, and should not be transitive (I'm not sure if even they can be). 
Stuff like this is why I've never bothered with this type of questioning in the technical screening for new hires. I might use a few to establish a base line in a phone interview but that's about it. When candidates come in for the technical part of the screening process I prefer to sit them down behind a computer and have them actually write code. My test usually lasts 2 hours, I hand them some specifications for what I want (which vary according to the skillset required) and let them go. They have full access to Google, Stack Overflow, and whatever other resources they would normally have access to during the course of their job. This approach has worked wonders for me in the past :)
If he's got a single system with &lt;2^32 records, then use a long and get on with business. But if that's the case, and he's not doing this on some tiny (rpi?) machine, then why would anyone be concerned about the performance on 4 byte vs 16 byte operations? People who seem really concerned with this on a theoretical level don't ever seem to benchmark things to prove their conclusions. I did. A guid, in my conditions (msSQL mainly) was 4 times slower at getting info than a long, which makes sense because it's 4 times bigger, we're just talking moving data around at that point. Immeasurably different at retrieving a record as a primary key. Without benchmarking it, this is all wankery and fairy tales.
This is brilliant. Would it be just as effective, if the applicant did it at home, where their Visual Studio keyboard mappings work as expected, and they have their own code base to inspect for answers? I can never remember which of the &lt;n&gt; ways to do it is the best way to remove %20 and similar from URIs but I *can* remember that my DecodeUri() method uses that best way. I guess a possibility is the person's expert buddy doing the at-home test. Require Skype?
Still seems kind of vague, maybe use JSON configuration and loop thru the a JSON object's properties with Newtonsoft.Json package using the JObject class or something?
Use those interview crash course books like Wikipedia, a collection of starting points. 
I don't understand what you want at all. If you describe the purpose of your application, that would probably help. If you gave an example of 'manually calling' a variable (the thing you want to avoid) in code, that would help a lot more. If you gave a pseudocode example of the code you'd like to be able to write as well, that would help even more.
The key part I am seeing here is: &gt; I was hoping to write something to import plugins that collect the variable names and pieces of information to be collected and then iterate through and make the calls to load the data. Are you trying to load assemblies dynamically? Are you aware of being able to get a list of properties through reflection? You can also get a list of properties with certain attributes on them.
Great stuff. So are you going to put this in a nuget package so we can all use it? Interesting read but for effort vs. gain, I'd still go with using a guid.
I think I understand - may I run a secnario by you? If Project A has a top-level dependency Project B, which has a top-level dependency of Project C version 1.1.5, it has a transient dependency on Project C 1.1.5 but can also have a top-level dependency on Project C 2.0.0 without a version conflict? And direct references to Project C within Project A will use the 2.0 version of the package?
I think what you're looking for is the [Factory Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern#C#). So you might have a Factory&lt;Person&gt; (look up Generics. An intuitive use-case is List&lt;int&gt;). If all your data is correct, except for the phone number, you'll probably want to return a Model with no phone number. In your current way, you'll return null if even just one piece of data is bad. GetModel sounds like it should be looking something up. Here, it's actually just creating a new object. 
It's also a bit of a dick move to give someone a 4h task to complete at home. (Yes I know you said 2h, but at-home tasks are usually 4h) It just screams "I don't want to work here".
4 hours is way too long. At the heart of it is that I just want to see them actually code and get a good feel for their skill level. I've interviewed plenty of people who could talk a good game but were useless when behind a keyboard. I also encourage them ask questions. You can tell a lot about someone from the questions they ask. 
I'm not sure I understand your example. If you're asking how an example would behave, I would just create the example and see how it behaves. Maybe your question can be answered by reading about [dependency resolution](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/dependency-resolution)
Hey, thanks for the answer! But I am not necessarily looking for a factory pattern, but for the best and most flexible ways to impose the constrains when creating the objects. No objects should be created based on faulty input. (e.g. email address not fulfilling standard email format =&gt; object is thrown away). With the phone number you are right: missing or mock phone nr should not disqualify the input record. &amp;#x200B; My concern is that later I want to write the objects to a database, and I am not really sure, that EF will be able to work with such a construct. I only have very limited exposure to EF (plain objects with no-logic public properties and public constructor). &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Cool. I did not know about Polly. Just got an idea and went for it. I'll definitely check out Polly ❤️
Well since you've got plenty of experience client side, using Angular / React + Ionic 4 or React Native would probably be the best way forward, and should be much quicker to get something off the ground than with Xamarin (given you'll need two UI projects for Xamarin, one for iOS &amp; one for Android). Also, it might be worth taking a look at Capacitor (from the guys that make Ionic), as it let's you build mobile web apps (html,css,js), with or without a JavaScript framework and let's you target iOS, Android, Electron (desktop applications for Windows, Mac and Linux) and the web, all from one code base. It's still in beta though. It's a fantastic idea. https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/
web? desktop? mobile? winforms? wpf? 
That is not the correct way to do it. Your model should be clean. You should use a factory to create your model based on the data. As the previous guy was telling you. You're architecture is wrong.
&gt; I don't want them using their personal code libraries, I want to see them code. It's coding, even if you're using your own code libraries. You can specify no library calls; just allow looking at the code base, like looking at StackOverflow. &gt; No because you couldn't guarantee they did it themselves. That's why I suggested Skype: you could glance at the screen and see that the applicant is working solo, listen and here that there's no coach off-screen. For me, it would be sufficient if I could bring my laptop, with my key mappings and (if allowed) my code base. I'd prefer that to remote. &gt; I want to see you come up with a solution that fits the allotted time. I don't want you to under or over engineer, I want you to make something that meets the specs in the allotted time. That's an intelligent requirement! However, *real world programmers* know that you iterate the solution. OK, the simple solution works. Add a feature, add another, until time runs out. That's how it works in many workplaces.
Bookmark
&gt; The problems are tailored so that they should be easily doable by someone of the given skill level in the given time. What's a sample problem? What would the time allotment be for that sample? I'm just curious about how challenging the code test is. Let's say my skill level is senior. If you don't want to give away a useful problem, PM me please. Thanks!
ok, thanks for the answer! Is there a factory pattern for C# which is most used? 
NP! You don't need a factory pattern. Interfaces/Abstract classes, with a [layer to your database](https://pastebin.com/HCixb4NL) seem up your alley. If you're concerned about inserting bad data into your database, then the layer(s) that handle inserting into the database should handle that. If you must,must,must,must have a good object immediately, then I'd go back with a factory.
Winforms hasn't really changed in years which is why you haven't found anything newer.
Hey thanks! That seems reasonable, I will take that route as I will be able to hook the Model up with the DB even with my limited EF experience. I will refactor my validator code into another layer.
Thank you kindly for your help. I think I have something that looks way more logical than I was trying using some (most) of this example, I just need to test it (which will have to wait until the AM)
Very true. 2004-2018. Nothing much changed. Maybe a few more features. But not really important. You don't miss out on much. 
Use WPF.
For fun you should check out WiseJ it uses almost identical to winforms code and dev experience but instead runs in a web browser.
Gotcha. Thanks for that info. I went with [this book.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1590590457/) 
I may be able to switch to WPF eventually but the project I’m taking over is a Windows form app.
That approach may work, but the reason your GUI is freezing is probably because your call to `Task.WaitAll()` is called on the UI thread. You'll want to spin up a background worker that will handle that call. That way your UI will be free to accept other input.
What you're seeing is thread pool exhaustion. When you await a bunch of tasks (in my exp anything over 100), you'll see program responsiveness tank. What I've done in that situation is pull off batches of tasks to await - it's easiest to base it on Environment.ProcessorCount. 
Lucky, same situation but I have no leverage to introduce service layers etc.
Your GUI is freezing because you told it to... the `Task.WaitAll` call will block until all the `Task`s passed to it have completed or failed. I think you have fallen into the trap that pretty much everyone (including me) falls into when dealing with async/await, which is to assume that the "async" part means code is magically multithreaded - that's not the case at all. I'd strongly recommend reading up further on async/await in order to better understand the nature of this beast, e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/a/37419845/
Look into CEFSharp (Chrome in C#) or the native web browser (extremely legacy JS) if you want a webview. If a webview login *makes sense* for your use case, I cannot say. I have a tool which uses chromium for an OAuth login via Azure Functions EasyAuth to login via google/microsoft/facebook, which then emits a more permanent access token (instead of relying on OAuth refresh). It works fine, but if I didn't want to support google/etc logins, I might as well use a native UI for the login.
Use a semaphore to limit the number of active calls at any one time. Then you can tweak the semaphore size to find your sweet spit.
You obviously don't use high performance high data databases. Your advice is *terrible*. Stay away from large databases please.
Cant you just ditch the while and just do the method once?
I'm trying to make it partial to error, so if anything other than a number is entered, it keeps going.
Oh, I can. Didn't think I could, thought I'd have to make two so it doesn't loop(even though it already is). I've made the changes but it's still looping. &amp;#x200B;
Also try to be as specific as possible with the search terms. If you're looking up an error message, for instance, you might want to use double quotes around the phrase. That signals to the search engine that you want to search for the whole phrase and not just the individual words. Limit the results to the last month or year so that old results that are now irrelevant to your problem don't give you false information (or false hope).
That's a lot of text for what is going on. Have a look at `for` and `foreach` loops and consider using a `List&lt;T&gt;` or `Dictionary&lt;TKey,TValue&gt;`. - https://www.dotnetperls.com/initialize-list - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18863187/how-can-i-loop-through-a-listt-and-grab-each-item/47029251
I can’t tell you for sure, but you should get in the habit of debugging these things yourself. For example, print out num right before you return it from getChoice. That will give you a hint on where the problem is!
`GetChoice()` and `GetChoice2()` both return `-1` instead of the `num` variable from each (but delete `GetChoice2()` and just use the other for both numbers. Now `num1` and `num2` are both `-1`, and so they satisfy the `while` condition `-1 != 9 &amp;&amp; -1 != 9`. Nothing in the loop body modifies `num1` and `num2` because none of the `if` clauses match. Thus, infinite loop.
There are many problems with this approach. First and foremost, you're likely to run into a TCP/IP connection limit far before you run into the performance limits of your program. You're going to need to change things in ServicePointManager and maybe the Windows registry. Second, are you really using the same authorization token for all the requests? If you're doing 10K requests for a single user, will doing all these requests in parallel just create lots of conflicts on updating the same data? Can the server receiving these requests handle 10,000 requests for the same user? Without creating locking and conflict problems on the server-side? What's the expiration on the Auth Token? If you're doing 10,000 requests, is it possible that token is going to expire in the middle? You seem to use basic string concatenation a lot. If you care about performance, you need to know that's not advisable. It creates a lot of extra GC work, and therefore will seriously impact performance in high performance scenarios. This part is not thread safe: success = await asset.AssetPOST(); { postCount++; } else { failCount++; } You will need to use `Interlocked.Increment` instead. Finally, you will be better off with a Producer/Consumer pattern. Spawning 10K threads off the threadpool will just lockup all system resources. If you're pulling threads off the ThreadPool (which Task.Run/Task.StartNew does), then the ThreadPool will only expand at 2 threads per second. Starting 10,000 threads all at once will seriously take a shit all over your system performance. Use a `BlockingCollection&lt;T&gt;`, where T is some kind of WorkItem object you define with all the information you need to make the request (again, keeping in mind that the AuthToken may expire in the middle). You then define a specific, fixed number of threads for processing the work items. **The limiting factor to performance is not likely to be the performance potential of your program**, but the networking limitations (and TCP/IP connection limits) between you and the server. You'll probably max out performance at 10 or 20 threads for BlockingCollection.
So would I be able to use `this` at the end of the loop to declare which value it's placing the number into? And how would I return the value of `showMenu()`? We just recently went over menus in my OOP class and I'm confused as to how they work still. I can't find any resources through the school's resource app that talk about this and I'm not good at learning through lectures, so my memory of menus in general is not great. &amp;#x200B;
I would generally just have an interface with a build method that takes the data and returns a model. Then implement that for your purposes. Interfaces are useful for testing and dependency injection.
the _dev_ environment I work on has multiple racks of Exadata, and you haven't benchmarked the it.
There's a few ways that I'd say were correct, but if you consider the idea that you may one day localize your application, it may be prudent to use an inline `DataTrigger` for something like this. I say that because your viewmodel really shouldn't be reaching into other parts of your code to determine the value of something (in this case, the text of the message). So, I would have the textblock displaying the message, but looking to the `IsNewUser` property to determine the display message and it would look (very) roughly something like this: &lt;TextBlock&gt; &lt;TextBlock.Style&gt; &lt;Style TargetType="{x:Type TextBlock}"&gt; &lt;Setter Property="Text" Value="{x:Static p:Resources.New_User_Message}" /&gt; &lt;Style.Triggers&gt; &lt;DataTrigger Binding="{Binding IsNewUser}" Value="False" &gt; &lt;Setter Property="Text" Value="{x:Static p:Resources.Existing_User_Message}" /&gt; &lt;/DataTrigger&gt; &lt;/Style.Triggers&gt; &lt;/Style&gt; &lt;/TextBlock.Style&gt; &lt;/TextBlock&gt;
So you might rely on Foo which requires newtonsoft 9, and on bar which requires newtonsoft 10, and you also directly rely on newtonsoft 10. You say you rely on Foo, Bar, and newtonsoft. The normal rules of nuget version dependency resolution works out behind the scenes. Or you may rely on Foo which requires newtonsoft 9, and on Bar which requires newtonsoft 10. But your app doesn't directly use newtonsoft. You say you rely on Foo and Bar. At work we have a Core library with dependencies on newtonsoft, RabbitMQ, Npgsql, etc. It used to be when someone installed our library their packages config showed all that junk they didn't care about. Now there's just a package reference to our library. So: a way to think of what goes into PackageRefence is just the packages you install via: Install-Package foo
What I haven't bumped into yet is one edge case. The c# compiler does this really dumb thing where if you rely on say newtonsoft 8 and you use a library that uses newtonsoft 10, the compiler objects to this, and doesn't allow the process to get to the nuget package version resolution step.
They are completely different, unless you count the common parts.
C# represents the language the core usually is written on. The life cycle may not be the same.. for instance.. we use scrum/agile or waterfall model to write .net applications on.. could be the same for other frameworks but game devs might have something different.. I am curious to know that myself. Other than that.. You would declare a variable/instantiate a class the same way in both scneriaos. 
Games are indeed software. What is a game engine? Maybe it’s just a while(true) loop that is constantly spawning new enemies and rendering the battlefield. Enemies are nothing more than C# objects. Maybe your enemies have a hierarchy (Inheritance). Maybe all your enemies move at different speeds and are required to implement a Move Walk, or Run method (Interface). 
Change `Task.WaitAll` to `await Task.WhenAll`
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/security/smart-cards 
As skeletorino said, games are software. You need to define how software works, how to react to unexpected conditions, how to accept user input, think about rolling out changes, tracking bugs, etc. Did you have something more specific in mind with your question?
That’s a great test. That way, you can see how they work through a real problem, see how they write code, and get a sense of experienced they are. When I was looking for a job, I had to take a few multiple choice .NET tests. They are all a waste of time. If I were looking for a developer, I would never insult candidates’ intelligence with such uninspired garbage. Tests *might* help determine how much a potential intern knows (though I doubt it). With experienced Devs, it’s extremely stupid, and says a lot about the company giving the test, imo. 
Thanks for the tips! I'll try it tomorrow after work. This actually isn't a school assignment. I just figured I would practice inheritance, abstract classes and polymorphism all in this one program to get ready for the mid term. I realize its kinda ambitious for me at this point considering how much trouble I have with it but couldn't thinj of much else(im terrible at studying, unless I'm given a laundry list of things to do I cant really teach myself something on my own time).
One of the things you'll learn over time is how to break down problems into their smaller components. Being good at that (and learning how to not overdo it) is a Hallmark of a good developer. I will say that what I described earlier has the benefit that your menu will automatically work for any size list. 
&gt; limit the number of active calls at any one time ServicePointManager is going to be doing that for OP already unless they change the defaults. In fact, OP will come back wondering why their new code still takes 45 minutes to complete until they learn that the default connection limit to a single host and protocol is two.
Yeah, OP's code is a serious shit show. Kudos for taking the time to point out the many problems.
Here's one way I've done this before for an ASP. NET MVC/SQL Server role: I gave them a spec sheet which basically has a data model representing a master detail relationship (say person and address) and some business rules (relationship, fields, fid constraints, etc) . They had Visual Studio and SQL Server developer edition installed (with the management console). I told them I expected them to create the database, create the application, add a page to display the people and their addresses (they can just extend the default MVC app). If they have time I would also like it to have full CRUD functionality for people and addresses. At this point they'll usually have questions. Things like whether they need to script the databases or can they just create them in management studio. Can they use Entity Framework or tools like MVC scaffolding. The answer is yes, and to get as much working as they can in the 2 hours. The test was the same for all levels, what varied was my expectations. I used to run the test with anywhere from 1 to 3 people at a time. I would be in and out of the area multiple times, often sitting behind them and watching them work (unnerving for some, but it's s test and I want to see them work). Note that I've only done this in small companies where I wasn't hamstrung by a mandated screening process and people were going to work directly for me. I never really codified the tests and my approach was always a bit seat of my pants when it came to preparing the tests, but it worked for me since I knew the skills I needed for my team. If they were close to something at the end, I'd usually give them extra time. When they were done I'd ask them to demo the solution and walk me through the code. At this point I'd ask questions about their design decisions, etc. I'd also pay close attention to coding style, patterns, etc. I've done variations where the tests themselves were more complicated, and for other technologies like front end devs, DBAs, etc. Does that give you a good idea?
That is an excellent, excellent process. Thanks for taking the time to write it all out. I'll now resume being intimidated and afraid to apply for jobs. :(
&gt; knowledge of .NET Framework is not very relevant when developing video games I think you might be using ".NET Framework" to refer to something else, something more specific, perhaps a subset of the .Net Framework like some part(s) of the FCL.. The term ".Net Framework" encompasses the entire FCL and CLR. Unless you think everything within mscorlib.dll, System.dll and System.Core.dll as well as the entire runtime and JIT compiler, along with all the performance implications therein, is not very relevant when developing video games. But that would just be silly.
The language is the same, but likely some features you will use more in game development than you would in say web development. One good example is threading, in a web app this is mostly done for you by IIS or Kestrel, you can survive quite a long time without really understanding this or just using async/await keywords. In game development this would be a critical part of your work I would think. To go the other direction, in web development you'll use a lot of web services, JSON parsing, validating input, all things you won't do much when making a game. For example many games won't need form validation past just naming your character. But if you're asking, "I want to make games, is learning generic C# going to work or do I need to learn a specific dialect of C#?" The answer would be that learning generic C# would be fine. Just note that it you're working on .Net Core or .Net Framework, Mono/Xamarin, etc, make sure you're training around the correct runtimes. 
You're trying to use managed identity? I think is would work only if you run it in azure app service.
Indeed I wanted to say asp.net or .net mvc, not the entire framework...
Not in terms of C# but remember you always have to learn the associated "framework", like Unity, CryEngine, [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET), WPF, e.t.c.
&gt;For the push notifications i didnt catch exactly what is your question? I think he's talking about the thing where websites ask to send you notifications sometimes, when you navigate to them with your browser. I've never looked into this functionality but personally I've always declined it.
I don't know anything about the feature where web browsers accept notifications from websites, however for apps, I use SignalR. If waking the device in response to a notification is important, then I believe you may have to use Firebase for Android and Apple whatever for iOS.
Technically, 63 bit integers. I use a generator based on Snowflake, but it is different from OP. OP's algorithm is generating *sequential* id's, not just *ascending* id's. Snowflake is only ascending on a single instance, not between multiple instances. OP's algorithm is not suitable for multiple application instances at all. Snowflake is also not sequential - id's jump gaps when the clock ticks.
yeah managed identity. And \&gt; I think is would work only if you run it in azure app service you mean you think my scenario wouldn't work running it locally? I'm not sure what you mean
If it is a presentation matter, and won't impact the logic of your form but just derive some behavior from it, then it's the View's business to display it properly.
I also found that that I was working in a bad spot for the way the program runs. &amp;#x200B; I've moved to GUIMain.cs. I am able to start a thread to begin monitoring the file, initialized like so: // Read Logs when enabled if (Settings.Default.killFeed &amp;&amp; rcon.Connected &amp;&amp; (Settings.Default.admFile != null || Settings.Default.admFile != "")) { this.Log("Option set to monitor logs, Creating instance and starting new thread_MonitorLog", LogType.Debug, false); Thread admLogMonitor = new Thread(new ThreadStart(thread_MonitorLog)); admLogMonitor.IsBackground = true; admLogMonitor.Start(); } This does trigger, I have verified via the this.Log output private void thread_MonitorLog() { this.Log("Starting Log Monitor Thread", LogType.Debug, false); string admFileName = Path.GetFileName(Settings.Default.admFile); FileInfo fInfo = new FileInfo(Settings.Default.admFile); string admFileDir = fInfo.Directory.Name; this.Log(Settings.Default.admFile, LogType.Debug, false); this.Log(admFileName, LogType.Debug, false); this.Log(admFileDir, LogType.Debug, false); this.Log("Starting Filesystem Watcher", LogType.Debug, false); var watch = new FileSystemWatcher { Path = admFileDir, Filter = admFileName, NotifyFilter = NotifyFilters.LastAccess | NotifyFilters.LastWrite | NotifyFilters.CreationTime //more options }; watch.Created += new FileSystemEventHandler(this.OnChanged); watch.Changed += new FileSystemEventHandler(this.OnChanged); watch.EnableRaisingEvents = true; } However this does not trigger: private void OnChanged(object source, FileSystemEventArgs e) { if (e.FullPath == Settings.Default.admFile) { this.Log("Change Detected", LogType.Debug, false); } } &amp;#x200B; I guess this is the first important component I really need to get working, because I don't want this reading the file unless the changes have been made to it (otherwise it actually prevents changes being made).
Technology hasn't changed since 2006. The books are as relevant now as then. Try to at least switch to WPF asap. 
WinForms is waaaay more productive than WPF. Especially for enterprise apps. 
If you know C#, the actual language, everything else is just libraries and methodologies. Programming to Unity is very different from programming to say, Xamarin, but they both use C#. C# is a language- you need to know it outside of whatever "purpose/thing" your trying to accomplish. Think of Xamarin, Unity, ASP.NET, Windows Apps, etc.. those are books. C# is English. If you know C#, you can read any book you want. Edit: English speaker deal with it. 
OP's algorithm is not sequential. Sure it's sequential after program starts but if you restart program there will be gaps because OP uses `DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks` as seed. There is also possible duplicate ids if OP generates ids faster than ticks and restarts app. But that's highly unlikely because ticks are so small. OP could have just used that `_lastId` as id. Why use string if you can use 64bit integer as id?
You should take a look at DataAnnotations https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.dataannotations This is also used by MVC to validate input
There is already validation in .NET Add the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` to your project. [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc668224.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc668224.aspx) The INotifyDataErrorInfo and IDataErrorInfo interfaces will work with databindings in WPF, and the validationattributes you place on your properties will be checked by Entity Framework. There's a lot to be gained for "free" here (still a bit of work).
Game Development, if with an engine, (for example, Unity, which uses C#) with c# will usually only add some using tags at the top of your code and Grant you a little bit more flexibility in the code. Otherwise, they are very similar, just that in software development from scratch, you'll have to do the rendering yourself, which is why if you are starting out, it's often better to start from a game engine. And yes, both are almost identical.
It must really fuck up some newer developers minds that. At the rate JS frameworks evolve, WinForms must look like an ancient dinosaur - but it's proof that if it works and is robust, don't fucking change it. Even newer alternatives like WPF haven't gotten as widespread adoption as WinForms did. I started a new project last year, choosing WPF over WinForms and I don't think I'm actually using any WPF specific features (other than populating a list of radiobuttons using databinding). Setting up observable ViewModels is just a glorious pain in the arse, slowing me down for no real benefit.
&gt; Try to at least switch to WPF asap. Why? WPF is also a dead-end, in terms of new development, too. I mean, for a new desktop app that doesn't require integrating DirectX/OGL 3D views, sure use WPF. But why go through the trouble of porting an existing app to it? If it's of any decent size, that's a lot of work for probably minimal payoff + new bugs.
Do you have any control at all over the development of the endpoint? Can you create an endpoint that takes batches of your requests? Might reduce the number of requests you need to make.
&gt; the flag i set is private static I missed the fact that you already had a flag - that'll teach me for trying to read code on my phone! The way you're using the flag is fine, except, as I said, that you want to check that it's true in CreateModelObject method. &gt; regarding lock (object) {...} i don't get the problem. The problem is that you said, originally: &gt; Model class uses lock(object o){ ..... } logic to ensure that the validators can only be set once And that's not what lock is for. That's what your boolean flag is for. Locking, as you said in your reply to me, is for concurrency safety, and is not needed here anyway. You should only lock "critical" sections of your code, where it's essential that only one thread runs at once, and where it's necessary to make your code thread-safe. Putting locks in places you don't need them will eventually lead to deadlock - not in this example, because there is only one lock, but you don't want to get into the habit of using them unnecessarily. And it certainly won't "ensure the validators can only be set once" which is what you said it's for originally.
Well
Yes, my understanding is that you can only get JWT token for MSI if you run your code in azure. Are you using this tutorial: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-connect-msi ?
You don't need the designer to make GUI apps, BTW. C# and XAML will work just fine. WPF and WinForms are Windows-only (even with .NET Core 3.0, they will fail to run on *nix), [so even if Rider adds designers, they'll only work on Windows](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2018/03/29/xaml-preview-tool-window-wpf-rider/). [Visual Studio for Mac](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/mac/get-started/hello-mac) allows you to develop Xamarin.Mac apps with a designer (i.e., live XAML preview).
You can definitely do it manually but is there a specific reason you don't want to use vstudio other than preferring JB Rider? It seems like it's [coming though](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2016/11/28/introducing-rider-the-new-net-ide-webinar-recording-and-qa/), although I'm not sure when. 
I did insert this bit before creating all of my tasks: ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit = 16; ...but 16 is a arbitrarily chosen integer, I did not know what to start with. Once I clean this up based on other suggestions I'll try changing it to see how it affects the speed and efficiency.
thanks, good point!
It's just leveraging the Attribute functionality - you can do anything with those as you can with any other piece of code, and they give you a few attributes out of the box.
Books are underrated these days
Tack, har kommit fram till att jag behöver använda mig utav en SQL. De blev för många entries, för att de skulle bli effektivt att använda XML. :( 
You must first create a object from your class like `private Database mydatabase = new Database();` then you can call the method `mydatabse.dbConnect();`
1st you need to make your Database class public, so it can be "found" by any other class in the same namespace. Secondly, in order to use it you'd need to instantiate it like this: &amp;#x200B; Database myDatabase = new Database(); &amp;#x200B; And then you can access its methods: &amp;#x200B; myDatabase.Connect(); &amp;#x200B; (hint: don't use the prefix "db" on the method name) &amp;#x200B; OR you could declare the clase static so you wouldn't need to instantiate it, and you could inmediately use it like this: &amp;#x200B; Database.Connect(); &amp;#x200B;
Yoi are declaring dbConnect as a method: public void dbConnect() But you are trying to use it as an object: dbConnect.Open(); What you need is change your database class to public: public class Database and create an instance: var db = new Database() And you can use the dbConnect method: db. dbConnect(); 
As a person who has made games in Unity and apps with .NET (Xamarin, ASP.NET Core, etc.).. I understand what you meant to say. Lots of people here are basically saying that game development is app development, but that's all in theory. In practice, game development is drastically different from app development. 
Just install ReSharper in visual studio. You will get all the features you like in rider with all the functionality of visual studio(xaml designer, server explorer, code lens, etc)
&gt; static so you wouldn't need to instantiate it, and you could inmediately use it like this This is what i've found erlier.. it wont create a database, if there are none, which it should. I cant open the database connection, or close it either . public class Database { private void CreateDatabase() { using (SQLiteConnection _connection = new SQLiteConnection()) { if (!File.Exists("database.db")); { SQLiteConnection.CreateFile("./database.db"); MessageBox.Show("New database created"); } } } public void ConnectionOpen() { SQLiteConnection Conn = new SQLiteConnection("./database.db"); Conn.Open(); Conn.Close(); } }
Do i have to define "var db = new Database()" in every object on the other forms?
It runs pretty fast on my pc, and offered some really cool features that i couldn't find in vs. Only down side is that its paid
Very informative thanks. So do people use other IDEs for desktop solutions? Or is it always VS
Almost always VS on Windows. 
I really appreciate regardless of any assistance that you might provide. 
Lists aren't just for looping. You can also access elements from a given index. The index, in this case, would be the player character id. `player1 = characterList[getChoice()];`
I know it's niche but what plugin? I'm using VS just out of ease tbh and am working on a project that will be done in unity but for now I'm just working on a concept as a gui app first to share my idea with people easier without making all the resources or placeholder textures or anything. 
I would suggest refactoring code in a way that makes it less tied to UI framework. I had my own WinForms app that I wanted to convert to WPF. Looked at state of WPF tooling starting from 2010 and did not convert. There was just too much work involved with not much benefit. 
The main plugin required for Unity3D that allows you access to intellisense and debugging. It's probably patched by now but I just couldn't wait and I don't want to go back to VS right now because I was forced to buy rider's license.
A millisecond is a lot of time in gamedev and an insignificant amount of time in regular dev, in most cases.
The concepts behind WPF are still sound today and in other languages. MVVM, using Observables.. If you have to stay in C#, at least it brings something new to the resume. Maybe not port the whole app, but maybe a screen there and there to play with a new technology and add meat to the resume. 
&gt; Would it be best to work in chunks of 50 or a 100 and check the token in between? Depends on how long before the token expires. They're commonly either 5 minutes, 20 minutes, or 1 hour. Checking 1/minute and refreshing 2 minutes before expiration shouldn't affect your performance. The Stopwatch class could come in handy for this purpose, as well as tracking your outgoing QPS.
&gt; But why go through the trouble of porting an existing app to it? Better handling of HiDPI, better text rendering and other graphics aspects, nicer third-party libraries. More modern paradigms. Pervasive data binding, clean view separation. More modern technologies such as XAML. Take all that together and regardless of whether your WPF app ends up mattering, you’ll be far better prepared for UWP, Xamarin Forms, Cocoa, and other modern frameworks. Even web ones like Angular. WinForms will teach you all the wrong things.
It's built in to visual studios now. It's one of the options in the installer.
You need to access the array with the type Leds or Switches. Im assuming they are enums so it would be something like: robCons[Switches.EnumMember] Or you can cast the integer to that type: robCons[(Switches)0] But the first method is preferable when possible.
You could possibly accomplish this by using a ML model trained on your voice alone. ML.net is a great ML and AI framework supported by Microsoft and is pretty easy to get started with. While there is no guarantee a simple algorithm wouldn't pick up other peoples voices by only training on yours it would definitely help.
Sorry yes you can, should have clarified there. Definitely possible, it's just with Xamarin I found myself using custom renderer for specific iOS or Android things more frequently than when building with hybrid web apps.
I think this might be where REPL service might come in handy. You basically prototype GUI design in REPL and when finished, you can save the history in REPL and clean up the implementation for your GUI. It would allows you to at least see the result in real time.
This is great, but the whole point of these questions are to see how you think. The whole thing becomes utter bullcrap if people just start learning them by wrote. I don't want to have to compete with people who are learning 300 questions off by heart but don't actually have the thought patterns behind them.
If I had to write code on a phone or tablet I'd just go buy some rope to hang myself...
I would recommend WPF over WinForms. WinForms has a load on limitations that are hard to get past if you are interested in even slightly more advanced UI elements.
Not sure. I even re-installed windows because I thought it was a .net issue. Nothing in logs or anything that would help. The plugin just wouldn't load. More specifically VS wouldn't detect it.
Yeah but I was using ECS at the time and the version in the installer isn't 2018.x iirc so that was kind of a deal breaker for me.
This looks like a pretty solid design to me... not sure what 'core' is but yeah. I'm not familiar with 12 factor app manifest but I am familiar with people going over the top in their attempts to enforce proper separation of concerns. Separation of concerns is awesome. Enforcing of separation of concerns is also a good thing but you can take it too far and just add a lot of unnecessary friction and hassle. That's something I have seen (and probably been responsible for more than I would like to admit). After a while you realize, everything in moderation. I like to remind myself that people build perfectly serviceable apps in node, python, etc where every chunk of code can override, reference internals and do anything they like to every other piece of code in the whole thing.. the key is just *dont do that*. You don't have to enforce everything at the compiler or repository level. 
&gt; and should only be sensitive to me This is Ph.D. territory. Good luck.
So I changed up my code, but I'm still having problems trying to read the inputs. Here's a pastebin of all of the code I have so far, including the classes I didn't include earlier: https://pastebin.com/jL8FEHm9 I'm not getting any syntax errors so it must be a logical error, but I'm reading it over and over and I can't find anything. 
If you want to create something quickly why do you need a book? I mean if you will spend a time to read a book then you are about to do some in-depth learning and maybe WPF is a better option. If you are really looking to build something quickly just try Windows Forms via trial and error and googling. If your case is indeed simple enough it should work. The biggest different with Java is events as opposed to observer pattern.
Jeez, why on earth is this downvoted. Obviously a lot of people who don't know anything who learn interview questions by wrote.
Okay, a couple things here: Line 10: while(play1 != 9 &amp;&amp; play2 != 9) You're going to keep looping until both player one and player two have selected 9. What's the significance of 9? Why are you doing this check here? I'd imagine you're getting stuck here. Line 30: List&lt;CharacterSelect&gt; menu = new List&lt;CharacterSelect&gt;() You should have this list either created in the Main and passed into the getChoice and showMenu function (and return the selection itself?) or as a Global (avoid that!). Then you only define it one time, and can pass/call it wherever you need it. static int getChoice() { int num; showMenu(); while(!int.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out num) &amp;&amp; num &lt;= 9 &amp;&amp; num &gt;= 1) { showMenu(); } return num; } I would say that you're also having trouble with the while loop here. In order to tackle this, separate the concerns a little better. Start with 'int num = 0', and write your while loop as 'while(num &lt; 1 || num &gt; 9)', then call showMenu(heroList), and then parse the input. If it's valid input, it will just exit the loop. If not, it will repeat the process. You've also written a way to parse the input of the player twice, once in getChoice and once in showMenu. Do it only in the getChoice one. I actually just rewrote what you had real quick, and it works fine for me. [Here's the pastebin](https://pastebin.com/k82JrHDw).
So I rewrote it like you did, and it still doesn't work. The loop isn't happening, it's just going through getChoice twice then doing nothing until 9 is pressed with exits the program. https://pastebin.com/0WYAciC8
Alright, so I tried printing the values after the code runs and I'm getting ConsoleApp15.CharacterSelect for both. What's going on here?
What's your print statement? Console.WriteLine(play1); Console.WriteLine(play1.getPlayer1()); Cause the first prints the object info and address, the second prints the character name. 
Ah, that's why. Tried that and now its giving me the names but they're in wrong order(i.e if 2 is Falco and 6 is Ice Climbers, but 0 is Fox and 5 is Captain Falcon, its giving me the indexes of 0 and 5, not 2 and 6).
If you really want to practise programming while traveling, Windows palmtop computers or mini pads do exist, and they are fairly affordable. These things will be much more comfortable and efficient than android phones.
I'm on mobile, so I can expand if you have questions, but the dependency between services, db, and core don't sit right with me. Essentially, there should be more branches there. Services should have a direct dependency on Core and it shouldn't be "through" the db project. The DB project shouldn't have anything depending on it, since that indicates to much of a direct dependency on a specific persistence mechanism. Steve Smith has an example project on Github that is a great example of a modern project that follows three onion architecture/ports and adapters architecture that does well in seeing up all these dependencies.
 line 30: return cSelect[num - 1]; Delete the -1. 
Can you give an example?
I agree with this. I know in my version of "core", I'm keeping models or POCOs, helper / extension methods, and misc global (non business logic). Services would be more dependent on classes from core, and your database related things would be more of a dependency of your services. I've also stopped creating separate projects for database and service, since I typically dont deploy one without the other (if we're considering these separate assemblies and not classes). 
Thanks! So now the values are set, but the info that is supposed to show up isn't showing up. I'm going to assume its something to do within the character classes themselves?
What info would that be? 
Also, realized I forgot to output the muTips function to actually display what I wanna display. Since the function is void, Console.WriteLine(play1.muTips()); doesn't work. What can I do to print this out?
Have been working in WPF apps for years. Still banging.
Assuming you're using Git, put everything in it's own repo and then add other stuff as submodules as necessary. `git submodules add &lt;url&gt;`
Since I was 17 years old I have been in the industry full-time without a single day gap in my resume. I am 38 now. I am a senior software engineer and I was a hiring manager for over a decade. I was charged with shaping an enterprise development team at my former employer (top 3 defense contractor in the world) and I am involved with all applicant interviews in my current position. Any good manager isn't going to ask you any of the questions on these lists. I would come up with generic scenarios and have my applicants walk through their process to solve the problem. You can learn a lot about their technical and problems solving skills with this method. Best of all, they cannot be studied for :) I look for attitude, aptitude and a solid core understanding. The rest can be taught with a little mentoring and experience. 
who would of thought telling people to be master of your craft would be down voted right? 
Removed: Rule 4. Simplest is to write out some data to a text file using `System.IO.File.WriteAllText` and read it back with `System.IO.File.ReadAllText`. Once you got that working, you can look into more sophisticated methods, keyword you probably want to use is "serialization".
Removed: Rule 3. Sure, go ahead if you like. Maybe try asking one of the more generalized programming subreddits though.
&gt; Should they be in different repos Totally depends on the size of your project, I guess. [.NET Core GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/tree/master/src) uses a monolithic repository with everything included (and a bot to mirror commits for shared code) while [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/aspnet/Universe) has a "Universe" repo which includes submodules of the various packages.

Make power protected. That will allow child class to have access to it.
You could make health a property on enemy with a protected set and in the Brute constructer set the value of health. As long as health isn’t private, brute cane see it when it extends enemy

isnt this lambda expression/ arrow function? why golf mode btw?
Haha awesome I made a new account and need ten karma to post somewhere. Thanks for reading.
Haha awesome I made a new account and need ten karma to post somewhere. Thanks for reading.
"golf" refers to using as few characters as possible to write the code, from the game of the same name where lowest score wins. I don't know the official name for the feature.
If I remember correctly, DataGrid has an editing mode, so navigation and editing should be already set up for you, bar a minimum of configuration needed view-side. For anything else specific to your needs, you should hook up to the Grid's events in code behind (like pressing enter in the last row) and put you behavior and logic in there. &amp;#x200B;

I've found a lot of Libraries, but most of them boast that they stay with the file through filename changes, which is exactly the opposite of what I want. I want it to monitor the new file that is created when the old one is cycled to a new name.

And always use DateTimeOffset instead of DateTime. Because it's a unique point in time, whereas DateTime can be Local, UTC or Unspecified.
And now it looks like you will need even more karma. 
At least you now realize that you will lose karma if you post bad stuff, might I suggest trying to contribute to whatever discussion is being had, do that and you will probably have 10 karma before the end of the day. 
Link to the mentioned project: https://github.com/ardalis/CleanArchitecture Hadn't come across it before, thanks
Thanks for the tip. I thought each comment gave one karma. Looks like you get 2 karma when someone first upvotes your comment. Sorry...
I’ve been reading the website and it seems mostly to be common sense stuff. There are times I’ve broken the principles outlined in the document but normally as a shortcut with a view to factor it out properly, it’s more about management of this kind of standards guide than the guide itself. I don’t like some of the wording because it’s a little over prescriptivist. But the sentiment seems to be in the right place

Because the code inside Task.Run will run on another thread, so the variable 'i' will just continue to the next number (maybe, depends on the task scheduler but that's a longer story) before the DoWork function is executed. By creating a local copy called taskNum, you are securing that the right task number because it's created in the same scope as you create your task.
This is called a closure; the lambda needs to store a reference to all of the variables that it needs to access that are not a part of its scope. It does by creating a new class with a reference to the variable, so it'll refer directly to the variable i unless you copy it. It actually has nothing to do with the threading, you can see that it's reproducible just with an Action: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/271440/captured-variable-in-a-loop-in-c-sharp](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/271440/captured-variable-in-a-loop-in-c-sharp). (There's several good explanations/links in that post as well)
Wow thanks! I'm surprised the book I got this code from doesn't mention it 
I think that an ItemTemplate will be easier to handle than a DataGrid. ReactiveUI create a datatemplate with a registered view for the items. What I want is to avoid to open a new view/window for editing/add items. 
I found another one who has bit more features like find jobs, create resume, tutorials, ask questions and get responses, articles etc... on [online developers community](https://stoodQ.com)
Unless I'm mistaken this has not been an issue since c# 5, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16264289/captured-closure-loop-variable-in-c-sharp-5-0
You could use a for each loop. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16264289/captured-closure-loop-variable-in-c-sharp-5-0
I think you misunderstand the question. He's passing the iterator counter `i` to the function `DoWork` (for which he's creating tasks). I think the question is why he can't just pass `i` directly, but instead have to create the temporary variable `taskNum`.
Feels way to hard for me, since im pretty much a beginner :( 
Joined! I love the idea.
&gt; Some files exceeding 600+ lines This is neither bad nor unusual. While it has become a fashionable *opinion* that small files filled with tiny routines (less than a dozen lines?) are better, the measured quantified research shows the opposite (slower dev, slower maintenance, higher errors, slower fixes). To wit: A mountain of research on routine length has accumulated over the years, some of which is applicable to modern programs, and some of which isn’t: * A study by Basili and Perricone found that routine size was inversely co *related with errors; as the size of routines increased (up to 200 lines of code), the number of errors per line of code decreased (Basili and Perricone 1984). * Another study found that routine size was not correlated with errors, even though structural complexity and amount of data were correlated with errors (Shen et al. 1985). * A 1986 study found that small routines (32 lines of code or fewer) were not correlated with lower cost or fault rate (Card, Church, and Agresti 1986; Card and Glass 1990). The evidence suggested that larger routines (65 lines of code or more) were cheaper to develop per line of code. * An empirical study of 450 routines found that small routines (those with fewer than 143 source statements, including comments) had 23 percent more errors per line of code than larger routines but were 2.4 times less expensive to fix than larger routines (Selby and Basili 1991). * Another study found that code needed to be changed least when routines averaged 100 to 150 lines of code (Lind and Vairavan 1989). * A study at IBM found that the most error-prone routines were those that were larger than 500 lines of code. Beyond 500 lines, the error rate tended to be proportional to the size of the routine (Jones 1986a). Where does all this leave the question of routine length in object-oriented programs? A large percentage of routines in object-oriented programs will be accessor routines, which will be very short. From time to time, a complex algorithm will lead to a longer routine, and in those circumstances, the routine should be allowed to grow organically up to 100-200 lines. (A line is a noncomment, nonblank line of source code.) Decades of evidence say that routines of such length are no more error prone than shorter routines. Let issues such as depth of nesting, number of variables, and other complexity-related considerations dictate the length of the routine rather than imposing a length restriction per se. If you want to write routines longer than about 200 lines, be careful. None of the studies that reported decreased cost, decreased error rates, or both with larger routines distinguished among sizes larger than 200 lines, and you’re bound to run into an upper limit of understandability as you pass 200 lines of code. 
Yes, but the value of `i` is being updated by the loop. The lambda is capturing a reference to the *variable*. "Variable", as in it varies. int taskNum = i; // you're copying the *value* of i into taskNum, and then there is nothing modifying that variable. Think of a situation where you would *want* the behavior you're seeing. long tasksRunning = 0; for (int i = 0; i &lt; tasks.Length; i++) { tasks[i] = Task.Run(() =&gt; { var n = Interlocked.Increment(ref tasksRunning); Log($"There are {n} tasks running."); DoWork(); Interlocked.Decrement(ref tasksRunning); }); }
This is only 1 i, While there are 10 taskNum's on per loop
I would say as with anything, it depends on your goals and the scope of the project. - If you are trying to achieve *enterprise level(tm)* code, I would suggest a testing Project with at least unit tests. I would go with not testing views and controls with Unit test, instead you can look into UI or bdd tests if those interest you. - Models filtering data for the view definitely breaks mvvm.
&gt; Have only 1 project in solution in which everything sits in that project. Other than the lack of unit tests, this isn't necessarily that bad of a thing. As long as you aren't over-using `internal`, you can always separate things into different class library projects later. But... Unit Tests? Yes/No? &gt; Direct connections to database (Amazon RDS Database) so connection string is contained within the project :/ This is bad. If you ever check your code into source control (you do use source control, right?), then the connection string will be part of the history for anyone to browse. If you ever upload it to github as a public project, it will be automatically scraped for passwords by malicious bots. Ideally, you can just use an actual authentication scheme to connect to the database rather than a single password/secret for all users. If that's not possible with the backend, then you usually put the data access behind a web service front-end, and then that web service keeps its secrets securely with some sort of secret store. MVVM is a *design pattern*. Design Patterns are supposed to help make things easier, they're not a purpose in and of themselves. For example, Dependency Injection / IOC is supposed to make it so that all your code can be testable^1, which is pointless if you're not testing. Take some time to read up on what the design pattern you're using was meant to solve, and that will go a long way to help you realize how to use it properly. ^1 Technically, Dependency Injection is to make it easier to replace your dependencies with different implementations. The most common use of that is testing, but it can also be used to have configurable different data stores and such.
&gt;WPF will require a week of banging your head to get the simplest of ui apps working, until you submit to the wpf way of thinking/doing/mvvmvvm'ing. You want to add ata to this control? Oh you want to just set the value in a quick, convenient way? NO, USE DATA BINDINGS FOR EVERYTHING REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.
Simple: just get the id of the control and set it’s data. Wait wut ... there are no ids? wtf?
You don't need to do this dll import, you've got the .net framework to use. Check out the system.Io.path class.
Bringing you back up again :) Seriously, who would downvote this? 
You do realize that there is also a dragged and drop for wpf too right...
I would be a bit concerned about using those studies, which are all 30 years old, with how much things have changed, not just in how or what we're writing, but the amount of tools, IDEs, and such that we have today. 
My answer would be to avoid having this question at all. Don't use `Task.Run` in the loop. Instead, make a `DoWorkAsync`. var tasks = new List&lt;Task&gt;(); for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) { tasks.Add(DoWorkAsync(i)); } public Task DoWorkAsync(int taskNum) { // If absolutely necessary, call Task.Run here return Task.Run(() =&gt; DoWork(taskNum)); }
We try to be more than a QA place. We're a community where people simply share their daily programming struggles and victories, where they get cheered up and so on. We wa t to be ad friendly as possible. We don't provide better quality answers, it's unreasonable to even compare. But we have our pros, just as we do our cons and like others noted, competition is good. 
To be fair, I would be hesitant to throw it away entirely... but yeah any sort of research in a modern language would be nice. Even if we weren't in /r/csharp languages that did exist at the time like C++ have changed radically since... 1991...
"Power PAINT" :p Afaik you have to use VBA to create macros for office programs
&gt; Looking at a the screen shot I have no idea why they are injecting models and view models. It looks like he is using MVP.

Just a little warning, since you hardcoded "COM3". Apparently, you are connecting to USB serial device (converter, Arduino, whatever) and not real COM pci/pciex card because those cards and their ports always exist, wether or not device is connected to them. Virtual COM ports like Arduino sometimes change number when you reconnect them. Or if such virtual port already exists (COM3 for example), on some other machine that might be 4. Or 2. Watch out for this and leave an config option to change port - never rely on fact that if it exists on development machine it will exists at user machine.
That one doesn’t seem to offer short path names. (Why one still needs those in 2018 is another question entirely.)
Yes, you can make document or application level customizations for office with c# and vsto
You’re attacking a scarecrow. People support smaller method sizes because it decreases the cognitive load put on someone trying to understand and then update the application. Errors are going to happen, that’s why automated testing exists.
Yes we have.
Perfect Initialized a Boolean value to true Create while loop using previously mentioned Boolean Write to screen a menu 1 for play game 2 to quit Read user input If 2 make Boolean false If 1 logic for game 
Smaller methods are more fragmented/less cohesive/non-linear, which increases cognitive load. Errors happen, but preventing them early can be orders of magnitude cheaper/faster than catching them later in testing. QA's job is to verify a correct implementation of requirements, not debug someone else's code. Anyways, the studies cited speak for themselves. If there are other actual studies (not just anecdotal opinions) that say otherwise, please post.
It really depends on how small we’re talking here. Used in a sane way, around 10-20 LOC, and focusing on singular tasks of a given abstraction layer, it makes understanding methods trivial. If you start getting into &lt;10 LOC then it can be a hindrance. Also, those studies are from the mid-80s and have nothing to do with what I was arguing. If you have any recent studies pertinent to method size impacting cognitive load then by all means, I would love to see them!
As an extension to what /u/jonjonbee has pointed out, please check out this article by Stephen Cleary (who has a ton of great material on async / await in general): [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/jj991977.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/jj991977.aspx) This article has a section mentioning the exact scenario mentioned above and how to fix it. 
Insufficient data for a meaningful answer.
Except the mechanics of writing code *has* changed significantly. Between all the education, tooling, and automation that exist now, it's downright magical compared to the tools available when those studies were written.
this works :) if you're curious: private void connectToDevice() { isConnected = true; string selectedPort = portsBoxList.GetItemText(portsBoxList.SelectedItem); port = new SerialPort(selectedPort, 9600, Parity.None, 8, StopBits.One); try { port.Open(); port.Write("#STAR\n"); button1.Text = "Disconnect"; enableControls(); couldNotConnect.Text = "Connected!"; } catch { couldNotConnect.Text = "Could not connect"; Application.Restart(); } } &amp;#x200B;
So I was able to get it to work, but one minor issue... if I key in "y" to play again, it starts over and asks me to guess a number between 1 and 100 but it also repeats "play again y/n?" with it too. Can't figure out how to not repeat that last part until the guessing game is over again... would you be able to take a look at my code and offer some input by chance?
Oh no, the "n" works fine and exits the program but when you type "y" to play again, it starts the game over then immediately prints "would you like to play again y/n?" with it. Does that make any sense?
So I tried using the do while loop. I did "do" and then put all of my code for the game in the brackets. At the bottom of the code is the question to play again and then finally the while portion at the end has while (playAgain == "y") I could post a pastebin of the code if you're willing to take a look.
As a person with similar interests, I will never not up vote you. Just one question 🙋. Is QML similar to XAML?
Yes you can! https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/office-tools/
Not really. They are both declarative, but that's where the similarities end. QML is easier to read and is less verbose. It is particularly familiar for anyone used to curly-brace languages. Also QML allows you to easily embed code for event handlers and conditional statements. In XAML these constructs need to be in code-behind or a bound model/viewmodel.
So insense there is no visual editor for creating GUI application in QML yet!
Pastebin would be great, just so we can actually see what your trying to explain, hard enough to explain code at the best of times but even harder when you don't know all the terminology. General idea is var playing = true; while (playing) { //Game var playAgain = Console.ReadLine(); if (playAgain != "Y") { playing = false; } } Console.WriteLine("Thanks for playing!"); //End the game By setting playing = false it tells the program not to continue the loop and when it completes the block will just continue executing, otherwise when it gets to the end of the block "playing" is still true so it goes back through the while block again.
Qt bindings like this always sound good on paper but then break in arcane and inexplicable ways when you try to actually use it. 
Wow, didn't notice😅
Hah nerds.
Feels like the OP posted here after his StackOverflow question was closed for being too broad... 
Power Point... Autocorrect:P
Thank you all!
thank you for the elaborate response. knowing .exe files do are not used in Unix-based systems (e.g. Mac OS and Linux) if you were to develop mostly cross-platform console applications using C#, how would you do that while avoiding a program like Wine?
There is another project for cross-platform GUI development already. [https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) It's much more developed.
.NET Core generates a dll file containing IL. You use 'dotnet AppName.dll' to launch the app. CoreRT has the capability to AOT compile a full . NET Core Runtime and generate a single exe file for windows, and Elf for *nix. 
Can you send a link to a tutorial on this framework? I can't find any
[https://discord.gg/Bfme3PD](https://discord.gg/Bfme3PD) perma link for the server.
Yeah, Avalonia is awesome. It still has a ways to go, but as it stands it's very impressive with how far it has gotten. :)
Through dotnet console command
thanks. on which directory should I run this command? 
&gt; It's much more developed. What do you mean?
I agree with you, but this isn't a Qt binding, it's a QML plugin. There is no intention to ever wrap Qt. It is too error prone. I garuntee you, this doesn't break. There isn't much that *could* break.
Avalonia will never perform as well this. When you manage 2D drawing in .NET, the PInvoke boundary becomes too chatty and slows rendering down. This is why WPF has PresentationFramework.dll. It exposes the primitives WPF needs so that it can make only 1 boundary call that gets translated 30+ Direct3D calls. This is exactly what you get with Qml.Net as well. The only PInvoke needed is to get data in QML. After that, rendering performance is all native speed. 
Removed: Rule 4.
What have you used, and what issues did you run into?
&gt; Main is an obvious exception Not really, actually. Main is a non-background thread, and the program won't finish before all non-background threads are done, so main isn't special in that regard. Then, any background threads are automatically killed and the program terminates.
[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/path-markup-syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/path-markup-syntax) You can draw these things in Visual Studio Blend.
It's been too long since I personally got into it to remember the details, but a colleague of mine tried to implement an editor with it this past year. I don't remember all of the details, but I think the gist of it was this: It was an editor where you could define the bounds of a texture. Think of a sub-image packed into part of an image. To do this, it allowed you to set the min/max bounds of the image in either pixels(0~width/height) or normalized co-ordinates (0~1). This required some validation and circular updating. For example, given a 512x512 image, if you set the MinX pixel to 128 it would set the NormalizedMinX to 0.25, and vice-versa. But if you tried to set MinX &gt; MaxX, or MinX &lt; 0, it needed to validate and reject that edit and keep the set of values in sync. I don't recall exactly why this situation caused such chaos, but I remember him trying to debug the chain of events for days. In any explicit context, this would've been trivial to solve. But anytime frameworks try to get too fancy with bindings, this type of thing always seems to crop up. It wouldn't surprise me if there was a more elegant solution to this than what he tried or arrived at, but the point remains. Sometimes the "magic" of frameworks like this make trivial things more complicated than they need to be. At any rate, my qualms with Qml don't rest entirely on its data-binding friction. I think it suffers from other problems, as well. But nothing is perfect, and I'm glad it's working out for you. And really, I do appreciate efforts like yours to make things more accessible. So, well done for that!
Essentially, with a console app, once the "main()" function ends, the program stops. "break"-ing out of a loop so main() finishes is one way of ending a console app.
I mean, the error message explains it: System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException: Index and length must refer to a location within the string. Where index and length are parameters in this method: System.String.Substring(Int32 startIndex, Int32 length) Which you are calling. One of those values are out of range (less than 0 or larger or equal to the string length.)
Ask Anders Heljberg. They fixed this behavior for `foreach` but not for `for`, long ago. I never agreed with their vague arguments for not fixing `for` as well.
kafka-net is outdated and not being updated anymore. Atm the best library to use is confluent's one. https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-dotnet That library has a .net standard version and can be used on both .net core as well as full framework.
This isn't really the reason, as the same example with `foreach` works correctly. It's because they accidentally designed the semantics for `for` and `foreach` in a way that didn't play well with delegates. They later fixed that for just `foreach`, for some reason.
That code has exactly the same problem.
QML noob here, what reads the QML? What other dependencies are required aside from the Core CLR?
I'm trying to move more and more stuff to USB-C, so buying such an expensive new device that does not have a single USB-C slot is no option for me.
Is it just me or is that actually *more* expensive than a similarly specd 13” MacBook Pro?
Thank you. That is a good question, actually. Certainly feels like people just downvote rational opinions a lot in this sub.

These Gtk3 bindings are pretty good: https://github.com/GtkSharp/GtkSharp I've been using them for a few months now.
I think /u/Hayden4126 accidentally fell out of /r/teenagers.
Yeah I’m looking for someone who can help with this topic, going to shoot them a personal message. Details are too much to explain in this one post.
https://github.com/SynHub/syn-speech Ive tinkered with this a few times
&gt; https://github.com/GtkSharp/GtkSharp Yeah, I much prefer Qt over GTK. Also, running GTK on non-linux platforms looks incredibly out-of-place. Qt/QML controls look native to the OS they render on.
As a long time windows computer guy, I moved to a 15" MacBook pro last year around this time and never looked back. I can run windows in a vm if I havd to, but I've really only had to do that rarely. 
Look at the documentation for the REST API and fix your application. &gt; limited C# experience &gt; .NET framework. I would suggest learning C#/.NET properly and understanding what the application was doing. C# is nowhere near as cryptic as some other languages without docs. 
Don't do this &amp;#x200B; Rewriting the SOAP calls to REST/json or REST/xml would be way easier and future proof.
&gt; We organize our projects in feature grouping not type group like your link I have thought about this but stuck with group types as it's just a personal project and I've had it like that for so long. I'd like to change it though as it's much better and makes more sense. So my App is to do with Series/TV Shows so some Models are like Show, Episode, Actor, Category, User, and some others - could you give an example of best way to split it? Will definitely be adding Unit Tests in the future once I have the proper structure in place as it has been bothering me for a while now
&gt; Details are too much to explain in this one post. They're not though... You're asking for a stranger to take part of their day to do something for you (write your code and/or teach you how to do it) have the courtesy to present all the information they will need to do so before they commit to attempting this. I would suggest editing your original post with a more detailed request.
I literally said I’ll dm them all of the information if someone is able to help. It’s too much information to explain and I don’t wanna put the code in a pastebin for everyone to see.
&gt; Have not had chance to add Unit tests yet but do plan on it sometime. Unit Tests are always easier to add at the beginning and keep up. They save you time in the long run, even if it doesn't seem that way at first.
&gt;I literally said I’ll dm them all of the information if someone is able to help. and I'm trying to explain that you're asking complete strangers to do work for you for free. In your shoes you make it as easy as possible for someone to help you. I'm trying to explain how to better ask for help so people will be more willing to engage with you on the issue.
Yep agreed. More just of a "personal project, doesn't matter to me" and lazy factor 
Alright kind sir, thank you for your insight. I am looking for someone to help me with comprehending the exact requests needed to generate a positive checkout on the website. I have in my code, what I believe are he required post/get requests, however, it is still not functioning properly. I am assuming this is because when entering the credit card value and cvv value, the website then sends another post request their payment handler (hosted PCI), and retrieves back from them an encrypted credit card value and cvv value. In addition to that, they also retrieve a captcha response and captcha token from that API. My code does indeed retrieve this captcha response and captcha token. However, although I see a status of “success” with the payment processor request, it still does not check out as intended. I am not sure what is wrong here. If someone has experience handling payment processors and sending the proper requests, that would be greatly appreciated. I could also show my code if required. 
You can do that via triggers and code templates, but yeah it is quite verbose.
You're still being to vague. How do I know what process the site you're trying to bot is using? You have not told me the site. &amp;#x200B; When asking questions like this, think of it from the other parties perspective. We don't have ANY information about what you're doing except what you tell us, how can we help you understand things if we don't have a full picture of the issue?

Thanks a lot for your help. To my knowledge, if I am using on httpclient for all of the requests, are the cookies not being passed through? Or is this a false assumption to make.
[Check this out](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12373738/how-do-i-set-a-cookie-on-httpclients-httprequestmessage)
Doesn't Inkscape have an option to export to XAML? I would assume that would have the correct syntax for anything used in WPF.
Ok sounds good I’ll take a look at the cookies. Thanks a bunch. 
Another alternative, and on that I use. I have a desktop for development at home that is essentially always on, running Win 10 and VS 2017. I also have Chrome Remote Desktop on it. When I need to work on stuff with a tablet, I usually install Chrome Remote Desktop app for android/ios and attach a BT keyboard to my tablet, and just code on my desktop from afar.
I may have misinterpreted you, but from my experience with httpclients they (the client) are disposed of after the request. You need to create one for each request you make. As for handling cookies, what you can do is create an httpclienthandler, store the cookies in the CookieContainer property, then you can pass this into your httpclients constructor. This should maintain the cookies throughout the process.
It just says how to make a button with "Hello, World!". Is there something more? Like creating a layout, navigating between pages?
I just attended a hackathon where I wrote the backend for an app written in QML whereas the qt-dev really did not take more than 2h to show an impressive good-looking prototype, since then I am quite interested in qt....So I wanna understand what you've built: Usually, qt-applications are written in C++ so the whole stuff (GUI &amp; logic) compiles into one native binary... Somehow, you have to make the qt-library available to the c#-compiler, how do u achieve that? PS: thanks for your work!
It's a real shame `RegisterHotKey` is at the bottom given that it seems to be the best fit for the use case in the SO question. 
Yea i agree XD i chose that SO post more so because the top voted solutions fit general global key listening. RegisterHotKey behaves a bit weird and i don't think it's something OP wants btw just in case he reads this conversation chain. It's been ages but if my memory serves right you need some weird shenanigans to make it work for a console app in the first place and then it blocks other apps from receiving that key press which is fine for a keycombo like ctrl+shift+G but really odd behaviour for just "G".
I currently use it in production. This project is unique in that it is really only a *bridge* between .NET and QML, both of witch I consider production ready for enterprise. The bridge itself (Qml.Net) is pretty solid and has a good coverage of unit tests covered for OSX/Linux/Windows. There isn't really much to Qml.Net. Remember, the entire KDE desktop environment is written in it.

I didn't know there was something like this for XAML 
Ignore what I said about modules/separate projecys rn, your app is still small and while it is so you don't need to deal with such concerns. Def use a separate project for unit tests as others suggest. There is only one kind of view model and a view model is a class. You need to provide the data in the Show class (part of your model) to the MainViewModel class and then bind it to your WindowMain view. You should not need to add any code to your code behind file.
does it have a newer, faster cpu than the macbook pro?
Why wouldn't this approach be possible with Avalonia?
I code my WPF apps as WinForm apps, essentially. 😂 none of these are serious apps, mostly helper utilities for personal or work use
Sorry, I did not ask how to store data.
Yes, I'm talking about issues with using Qml in general. I'm sure your bindings work fine.
[State machines](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StateMachineBasics.html) basically. You take your configuration and power a state machine off it. Be careful about metaprogramming. That is, moving code into configuration in the hope of reducing the amount of code you write. The configuration becomes code but without the benefits of debugger support, type safety, etc.

tried to add cookies to my httpclient this way, however it doesnt work. any ideas? 
There's always embedding the class name into a data store of some sort (like the JSON file), but that can open you up to all sorts of ugly security issues. But just as an example, you can use: Type t = Type.GetType(typenameStringFromJsonFileOrDatabaseOrWhatever); if(t != null) { return (MyBaseClass)Activator.CreateInstance(t); } I use this technique pretty often instead of config-driven DI. Just feed it magic class-names (in their fully-qualified forms or at least in their full-name forms) from your data source.
&gt; it doesnt work. any ideas? Yes. State your problems more clearly and stop trying to dupe others into doing the work for you.

in other words, this is my code: response = await client.GetAsync("https://www.ssense.com/en-ca/checkout"); foreach (string cookieName in response.Cookie) { var cookie = response.Cookies[cookieName]; cookieContainer.Add(new Cookie(cookie.Name, cookie.Value, cookie.Path, "https://www.ssense.com/en-ca/checkout")); } How would i retrieve the cookies from response?
I bet every company has a back door front door side door trapdoor. Not a surprise at all. Just stay in a Faraday cage with no internet to protect yourself from the satellite mind beams. That's the only way to be secure
I, too, was abducted by aliens in the late 1990s.
If you construct sql inside the code. You could write some harmful queries as parameters. Its not that hard to guard against.
Yeah we currently use a database project and update by schema compare do its all in source control. I don't mind stored procs for some things but for simple CRUD operations it seems pointless. It takes time to create and update especially when I'm creating a service layer on top of it.
Well you always pass the input as a parameter and you will never run into an SQL injection. Sure you can construct the SQL as a string and skip using parameters but with EF you can just execute the same SQL as a string, it is no way more secure against this hypothetical mistake.
Using your MTG example, I could think there would be a way to store a Lua (or whatever scripting language you want to add on?) script inside the data file that is called for that event. You would need to be careful about how you're feeding data in/out for it to be affected. Perhaps you limit the scope of changes affected by these events based on the data you feed them. Categorize them into different ones, feed data based on the category (affects board state, adds mana, heals/damages a hero, whatever), and the card then affects that. Or some such. Of course this means that you need an authoritative state, so like MTG, a game server that runs it. You have to prevent someone just willy nilly changing the data's script into whatever (also why you're limiting scope). Or some such. I'm just spit balling an idea here. Scripting could be a good idea, imo.
I'm not a game programmer (well I was in the 90's) but why would you need 200 classes? Go data driven and just do presentation of that JSON as data classes or structs without any logic in them. Create something like GameEvent, GameAction and GameSpawnCondition classes that only contain data. Deserialize your JSON to those classes. Then create a system class that operates on that data and changes your game state accordingly. Json.NET can deserialize to enums to make things more type safe, so you could create enums for Type and Operator properties, but for Operator you need to change it to something like "Plus", "Minus" and "GreaterOrEqual" to make it work. 
Thanks. I'll give it a closer look later! 
Looks like .NET core is slowly becoming a bit like JavaScript with all the new half-baked UI frameworks coming up. It is good and bad at the same time. I think I will just wait for now. One of these experiments may end up being a decent framework one day. In 3-5 years we may have something useful.

There’s no solution, that’s why I’m posting here
&gt; Entity framework is great but sometimes it is too slow You're gonna have to be very specific with the "sometimes" here. Have you turned off tracking? Are you making sure not to eager load everything when you only need a little bit? Are you making sure to do eager loading when you know you need the entire graph, and avoid a round-trip to the database later? Have you tried calling raw SQL from the Entity Framework using the SqlQuery method?
Yes I know about the lazy loading and tracking. I have not tried 
Only with httpwebrequest. I cannot find how to do it with the client.
They are, but you’ll likely speed up development and debugging efforts using something like Dapper. Quality of life matters, and developing and maintaining storage layers with EF is no fun at all.
I said I didn't want 200 classes. What you're describing is what I've been doing (like in the JSON example I posted). The problem is that this is a lot of work when your game becomes much more complicated. The question was if there was something easier than this, or some kind of automated tool to make this faster to develop. 
Even if you turn off tracking and only select the fields you need, there are several types of queries where it creates sub-optimal SQL. Yes you can use SqlQuery, but at that point you're not really using EF. We use EF for queries that it can do properly and drop down to SqlQuery for types of queries that EF sucks at. As an example of one of the things it sucks at: Take and Skip translate into TOP/FETCH NEXT and OFFSET. When it does this it does not use variables for them which means your SQL Server cannot cache the execution plan. See https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/dotnet/net-tools/entity-framework-performance-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/ 
Provide the data in the Show class to View Model class how? Currently the View Model has a `CollectionViewSource` which the `CollectionViewSource.Source` is bound to a `List&lt;Show&gt;` &gt; You should not need to add any code to your code behind file. What _should_ go into the code behind file? What about downloading images, handling window resize?
I see your point, but if it's breaking down/freezing under heavy load during a deadline it may be a poor option. Or if its graphics driver can't drive enough resolution for a big WQHD monitor, fans run all the time on high during heavy load to the point of being distracting, runs too hot under load to sit on lap or has thermal CPU throttling you may have a bad time coding. I say this after having upgraded from an older thinkpad to a new one while working on a project that involves heavy (hours per iteration) SQL to DynamoDB data migrations and enjoying the upgrade quite a bit.
No because I asked about this a couple of weeks ago and people made fun of me.
thank you so much for this i have been trying to find it. Just a quick follow up question, is it possible to get the cookies exactly from the var myresponse? I am trying to maintain a consistent session.
No because I asked about this a couple of weeks ago and people made fun of me.
Hmmm I was just looking at [this](https://github.com/timschreiber/DapperUnitOfWork) project and it seems pretty cool except I don't know how well something like this would handle mass updating a table. I also see Dapper has BulkMerge I guess. It seems a bulk update operation would hit the db a lot of times. Currently we use merge/upsert which I think is a huge positive for performance because updates are very fast.
Blend? It's installed alongside Visual Studio
When you call `using (DBConnection)`, it invisibly calls `DBConnection.Dispose()`. I *imagine* the easiest fix is to do something like this using ( var DBConnection = new SQLiteConnection("Data Source=./Database.db ") { /*code*/ } But you probably don't want to keep opening and closing the connection, so I imagine something like [https://www.devart.com/dotconnect/sqlite/docs/devart.data.sqlite~devart.data.sqlite.sqliteconnection.html](this) makes more sense
I'm not an expert, but I think it's in the method at the bottom where you have: using (DBConnection) { // Stuff here } That's what's crashing you, because when you leave a using block you automatically dispose of the thing you were using. Since you are referencing the DBConnection at the top of your class, you probably don't want to dispose of it that way. Just open and close it like you are doing in the other methods and maybe that will work better for you.
Create a branch of your code for it, install the nuget package, and give it a whirl. Shouldn't take very long.
Until you find out another tool uses data from that database and builds their SQL with no parameters of their own...
DbContext has huge overhead just newing it up compared to Dapper.
Unless you have simple joins I would avoid EF queries like the plague. The only thing it is good for is saving but only if you persist &lt; 10 records at a time. Or if you really hate sql... 
 No. No it is not. Contexts were made to be short-lived, there is nearly no cost to creating an instance. The EF DI is not implemented as a singleton so the context is new'd up for every single request that is created. It is incredibly cheap. &amp;#x200B; Stop spreading misinformation about EF. I don't mind people not liking it, but most people don't like it for completely invalid reasons.
Yeah I do as much code generation as I can. a project I made you might like then. Check out the .Data project and the Tests folder in the integration test. [https://github.com/TheKingFisher/TemplateProject](https://github.com/TheKingFisher/TemplateProject) It has .tt files for generating pocos, then .tt files for generating UOW and repositories, then a .tt for scaffolding. The reason I'm not using it for the project is that its for entity framework and we are using [ADO.net](https://ADO.net). Do you use a different tool for generating code than T4?
Honestly dude, you are prematurely optimising things. Use entity framework for CRUD, it performs fine. For complex queries use stored procs. 
Roslyn is my go to nowadays. I would just use dapper though. It's a great balance between performance and rapid development.
Is It/QML half-baked?
You can query stored procs with one or more result sets with Dapper
While I would agree that for one app you should try and rewrite calls, for large scale outdated applications (think enterprises) - is the way they actually go - with a proxy - along with multitude of other things - message routing, queing, etc. These proxies along with multitude of other features do much much and are called Enterprise Service Buses - they are there to wrap existing or putdated applications while rewriting. From opensource - check the WSO2.
My organization was very pro stored procs for a long time to prevent sql injection, which was fine except for the devs which took the inputs to the parameters and dynamically generated sql strings in the stored procs...
Not that it really makes a practical difference, but I believe `Main` is at least little bit special: the process won't exit before main returns, even if you change its executing thread to be a background thread.
&gt;Depending on how you define 'feature', there's no way to get around this. If you want your game to do something, you need to write code that does that thing. I think you're missing my point. There's a difference between changing a variable's value in code and writing an API to do so from json while keeping up with any other new variable you add to the project. They're very different. &gt;You've essentially already done this. Hardcoding would be much more performant than parsing configuration at runtime, too. Hardcoding the events wouldn't be hardcoding classes, it would be hardcoding object initializations of a single event class. I meant objects. Creating data like that seems really bad to me. The json lives in a database and is editable without having to recompile. Yes, the object you wrote would be the result of deserializing the json. The problem I'm running into is when the functionality needs to be more complex than the example I gave. 
Is this UWP? If you're using XAML, the code-behind (in theory) should really only do things related to presenting data from the view model that the UI framework can't do via declarative XAML. For example, only certain controls used to be able to bind to an \`ICommand\`, or other weird things, and you'd want to go in to codebehind in those edge cases. It's admittedly a bit confusing sometimes as to where the draw the line. But the .xaml and .xaml.cs both fall strictly under the "View" concern in MVVM. In your earlier example about the DisplayName, I think technically you'd want to bind the label to that \`DisplayName\` property and then use an IValueConverter in the binding. That converter object could check the settings and properly adjust the display name. Lastly, you really shouldn't need to interface a ViewModel. Not sure what exactly your controller models are, but I'd wager you don't need those as well. 
SQL Server has a query plan cache. It's not really recompiling your queries every time they run.
PetaPOCO https://github.com/CollaboratingPlatypus/PetaPoco/blob/development/README.markdown
Why is speed at the db level your companies main concern? How would security be affected by your proposed changes?
Interesting. Thanks for input! 
This is the best advice so far here.
Yeah that was my exact opinion but I'm just mid level and senior guys have other ideas. I asked that question in the interview and they kind of waved it aside.
&gt; storage layers with EF is no fun at all. yeah, I think people miss that fact that you can execute SQL or stored procs from EF
I suppose, if you’ve never heard of Qt, nor taken 15 seconds to look into what Qt/QML are, things may seem that way to you. Awesome job on this, BTW, I’ve been wanting a clean way to just fling data at a QML UI from .net that doesn’t involve HTTP requests for a long time, I’m very excited about this. 
&gt;Eager 😂
I'm sure the folks up there at the space station give two shits about the backdoors ;)
You're right on the mark with your ideas of using a UOW to simplify life for the developers and avoid costly mistakes such as transaction handling. You can always execute SQL or Stored Procs with EF for complex queries. I agree with the sentiment that you shouldn't give up on developer quality of life, find a way. Consider other options like Dapper as others have said. Not knowing how much data your app processes it's hard to give concrete advice. Consider that you might be solving the wrong problem. There might be other architectural changes you could implement that would make a bigger impact. A good example is implementing a read through cache and getting 10x + speed improvements on reads. In some cases using the actor model for scaling where the use case fits could help. Does all the data have to be inserted during the same transaction? Can you fire some events to message queues and process them async? Just a few examples of different ways of looking at the problem. Good luck, you seem like you care and are on the right track. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
If all your cards are dumb "conditions -&gt; actions", it's just a table ... It doesn't matter how do you save it (json, xml, csv, database...). But if you want some extra **behaviour** , you need some **language** to describe it: * "Programming language" - C# ... * "Scripting language - LUA ... * Your own DSL Pick your own poison. I would choose C# (obviously not hardcoding all classes, you have generics, inheritance etc.), but ...
Aha now we're getting to the heart of the matter and also the fun bit. You can either roll over and do things their way, or you can commence operation try-to-convince-senior-people, which is no small undertaking. First off, ask them if they are willing to hear you out, and measure if they are genuinely interested in changing the way they do things. If they aren't, you're wasting your breath. However, if they are willing to change their minds, ask them what their main concerns are and try to address them, gently. Often it's just a matter of suggesting a few alternatives. It might be just the case that they want to go with what they know. Either way, once the decision is made, be a team player and stick with it and support them.
What is the difference between this library and a linq query? I mean linq looks just like it. Example: var a = (from t in db.table where t.column=somevalue select t).toList(); 
Thanks! Join the gitter room for any questions. I'm really looking forward to onboarding people and getting some momentum with it. Not selfishly, but because I really think this is a nice way to do cross-platform .NET GUI. But yeah, that guy's comment really just was just drive-by-FUD.
Yeah, it should be, considering this is how WPF is, and Avalonia is very similar.
The first time, yes. But if you use parameterized SQL (like you will, *right??*) the database will cache the compiled query for subsequent calls, so no advantage. The advantage that stored procs do have though, is that they give you a place to possibly make a production change without having to test &amp; ship new application code. Dapper is good. PetaPoco is also pretty nice. 
&gt; The only thing it is good for is saving but only if you persist &lt; 10 records at a time. Holy crap is it slow at this though! 
&gt;When you manage 2D drawing in .NET, the PInvoke boundary becomes too chatty and slows rendering down. In my experience, PInvoke overhead is a non-concern for most graphics work in .NET. Modern API's (and modern techniques in older API's like OpenGL) are designed around efficient submission of work and reduced "chattiness" anyways. GPU work submission should be a relatively small portion of your overall CPU time. My app with 10,000+ draw calls (and many more API calls) easily bottlenecks on the GPU, and only hovers around 15% CPU utilization. More important than the overhead of a PInvoke is designing the proper architecture, and that's the same in any language. &gt;This is why WPF has PresentationFramework.dll. It exposes the primitives WPF needs so that it can make only 1 boundary call that gets translated 30+ Direct3D calls. Unless a lot has changed since [this was written](https://jeremiahmorrill.wordpress.com/2011/02/14/a-critical-deep-dive-into-the-wpf-rendering-system/), then WPF's rendering architecture is probably something to avoid rather than imitate.
Yeah I think I'm going to do a little proof of concept with a either of dapper or entity framework and some code generation tools that I write or find. But if it doesn't work out no big deal I'm still getting paid and I still learn another way to do things. Got some good suggestions here. Everything else the application has is solid. The service based architecture is great, security is good, and error handling and logging as well. I just thought there has got to be a better way than writing the similar stored procedures over and over.
What don't you like about EF? 
Great idea - but before you do the proof of concept, talk to the guys and just sound them out if they are interested in change, otherwise you're jumping ahead.
It's always amusing to me when people think their ORM is the performance bottleneck. It's almost always database architecture or software not being paralleled. 
oh thank you
Ok, Software engineering is different than gaming quite a bit. Usually when programming games you will use an engine like unity. The Syntax is the same, and I would say for you as a beginner definitely take time to learn C# first, and maybe try making software before going into a gaming thing. Not saying you have to be a Mozart of software, just be able to understand the syntax and a lot of the basics. Checkout Microsofts C# tutorials on their websites. 
&gt; In my experience, PInvoke overhead is a non-concern for most graphics work in .NET. I've experienced the exact opposite. Do some benchmarks. You'll find that a C# loop calling a PInvoke method that does nothing is ~20x slower than C++ doing a tight loop on the same function. This is further compounded by the fact that you need to make many OpenGL calls to render a single scene. &gt; Modern API's (and modern techniques in older API's like OpenGL) are designed around efficient submission of work and reduced "chattiness" anyways. This is great, but it will still be far from zero. When you want high FPS scenes with responsive feedback, you won't beat Qt/QtWidgets/QML with C#/PInvoke. I am doing a talk soon that will be demoing similar scenes in Avalonia and Qt/QML, side-by-side. And sure, Avalonia is in beta and it may do better in the future, but I bet my bottom dollar it will *never* out-perform (or even close to match) similar scenes in Qt/QML. &gt; Unless a lot has changed since this was written, then WPF's rendering architecture is probably something to avoid rather than imitate. You are confusing two things here. When I'm making comparisons to WPF, I'm simply making reference to the *spirit* of keeping PInvoke calls to a minimum. I'm sure you aren't arguing for *more* PInvoke, but I was simply making comparing WPF on that point alone. WPF may be inefficient itself, but it isn't because they didn't have more PInvoke calls, because that's a brick wall. I only ever compare Qml.Net/Qt/QML to WPF in terms of PInvoke calls, because you can't really compare them on anything else. Regardless of any arguments, or wether PInvoke is an actual issue or not, QML is faster than Avalonia, and that will always be the case. Similar to how Rust will always outperform JavaScript. It just will. Remember, Qml.Net doesn't really add anything to what QML offers you, other than you can use .NET. Arguing that Avalonia is better than QML is a very steep up-hill battle.
Stored Procedures aren't a silver bullet. You may run into "parameter sniffing" problems where one parameter generates a certain execution plan but when that plan is used with another parameter, things perform badly. I like Dapper for reads and Entity Framework for writes. 
&gt; Use entity framework for CRUD, it performs fine Entity Framework is expensive because: 1. it has to convert your LINQ to a SQL statement 2. it has to materialize your result set into a POCO 3. it has to track changes to the entity in case you call SaveChanges() There's a reason the Stack Overflow guys avoid it.
https://linq2db.github.io/ This LIB can use LINQ Queries like EF. But is incredible more faster. And you can use SQL in a microORM Style too. I prefer LINQ Syntax to get hep from the compiler and something broke. And with the T4 Templares is really quick to build the Poco Class for the entities. https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db/tree/master/Source/LinqToDB.Templates#t4-models For benchmark and comparison - https://github.com/FransBouma/RawDataAccessBencher
Sorry for FUD. I have a lot of UD when it comes to .net UI frameworks. &amp;#x200B; Anyway, it would be great if sample app would have build instructions for complete idiots. Now readme explains internals of the app but does not explain how to build it. &amp;#x200B;
You can save a XAML doc, but again this format does not seem to fit in with what I know in WPF. Maybe I am actual using the SVG incorrectly in WPF, but with this method as with the others, the SVG is not easy to manipulate. With the ones I use, I have a path, I give it a name and in the triggers I can manipulate it. This way the path has a ton of 'extra' properties that I don't need to set with downloaded icons. Find it very strange and confusing. 
&gt; sometimes it's too slow one never knows, but hopefully they know where
Nope. If that's slow, it's your DB that is slow.
If it's becoming complicated then maybe you put too much code in your classes. Try to use SOLID principles and split your code better so every class only has only single responsibility.
Thank you will do.
He gave you the exact code how to do it... And that code makes clear you can not get the cookies from the `myresponse` variable.
&gt; These benchmarks which were shared here recently show that calling a native function can be within 2x of a regular managed method invocation. But how does it compare to native code calling that same native method? That is the only thing that matters here.
&gt; In that 10x, what was the function doing? If nothing, your data is not representative. Doing nothing, with no marshaled parameters. A native loop calling native function, vs a managed loop calling a native function (via PInvoke). The native loop will iterate a lot faster than the managed loop will. This really just goes back to managed languages shouldn't be doing the rendering.
I think you missed /u/Gotebe's point. Calling a function that does nothing is not representative of anything interesting, because real functions do stuff that takes time, and thus the fixed overhead will be proportionately smaller.
actually do software can be more easier than a game. If you are learning make console apps to learn the basic data containers, streams , threads, events, exceptions. almost every language have those things.
&gt;manually drawing them out in code. I think there's been a misunderstanding. Blend has drawing tools, unlike Visual Studio. 
Misleading title. No Scratch is present. 
I guess it has to be english? Otherwise I could recommend books from 'Rheinwerk Verlag" (German)
Oh I need to look harder. I did try and find something to draw with and had no luck. Googling drawing SVG with Blend normally gets back to drawing paths. I will have a hard look now because that would be the optimal solution I am sure. Thank you.
It seems to use funny resources when using the export where I just want the code. I will actually try post a example later today.
Well, yes, drawing paths is what you do. Don't you in Inkscape? But you can do shape operations with the other shapes in the context menu and easily create more advanced paths. Like union or intersect. You need to learn to press shift or control to manipulate edges and vertexes, depending on the tool you have selected.
What kind of service are you designing where straightforward CRUD is actually what you need? I've basically never run into this scenario. There's always rules about what you can and can't change, and you're not going to trust the client to preserve your invariants, are you?
1) you can query with plain SQL or a sproc if you want 2) thats good 3) use .AsNoTracking() for pure queries with no update path The stack overflow guys *do use it* along with dapper
If creating the query itself is causing the issues then either you might be doing way too complicated joins or the db might be a little too scattered? It's not illegal to denormalize a little bit to gain performance. But you might be correct that writing sql manually is the way to go. That's why the method exists, for cases such as these. 
I was thinking about being abducted by aliens right before I read the notification that I got this comment
Thanks for sharing, I'm gonna watch this!
It would **likely** help if you mention what GUI framework you're using. Is this for WinForms? WPF? EtoForms? Gtk#? UWP?
&gt; The advantage that stored procs do have though, is that they give you a place to possibly make a production change without having to test &amp; ship new application code. The disadvantage that stored procs do have though, is that they give you a place to possibly make a production change without having to test &amp; ship new application code.
It hides away details such as the generated SQL. It's fairly easy to cause performance issues by accidentally constructing a query that is evaluated at the client-side instead of on the server (see the recent StackExchange outage). If you only deal with little data then this is a negligible factor. But if you deal with large data sets and performance is important, then EF can have a huge impact.
Removed: Rule 4. Try breaking the problem down into parts. Don't think about how all the loops interact. Once each part is working on its own, then you can try combining them.
Add ;select scope_identity() as id To the end of your sql statement
Yes, it is the reason. The Foreach effectively translates to (it's actually an interator,but anyways): &amp;#x200B; \`\`\` for (int i = 0; i &lt; things.Length; i++) { var thing = things\[i\]; } \`\`\` &amp;#x200B; The i is in the outer scope of the loop and the thing is in the inner scope. For example you can use i in the pieces of the \`\`\` for(int i = 0; i++ != 17; i = [Random.Ne](https://Random.Ne)xt(15,19)) \`\`\` But you couldn't do any such things with the foreach, or the TaskNum from the original example. &amp;#x200B; If you aren't convince, open IL Spy on the two versions.
Weird, try Convert.ToString(cmd.ExecuteScalar()) and see what the value is. Do you have an identity set up on tblBoekkast ? If you're using SSMS try running exec sp_help tblBoekkast
Why are you trying to export it as an XPS Document? You should be saving it as an SVG.
It's too early in the morning. I thought your title said "Looking for a simple framework to draw grapes".

Brian Noyes has a course on PluralSight - "WPF Productivity Playbook" While you still have to do certain things manually in the code, like creating styles, the course goes through how to use WPF designer properly and be way more efficient. Typical layout absolutely does not have to be done in xaml. Using Blend you get a lot more drag-drop design process when adding behavior and bindings.
Thank you for your answer. Can you demonstrate an example of second solution (i.e; You could also pass a factory delegate like `Func&lt;TParser&gt;` into the `SetDataParser` method instead. )
This is the kind of job an Inversion of Control container usually solves. You register an interface and the implementation type with the container and the container then figures out how to create this object. You'd typically also have to register the constructor parameter types of this registered type unless the constructor just takes basic type objects as arguments. In the Unity container (not the game engine) it's like this: container.Registertype&lt;ApplicationSettings&gt;(); container.RegisterType&lt;IParser&lt;&gt;,MessageParser&gt;(); var parser = container.Resolve&lt;MessageParser&gt;(); If the hierarchy was deeper than this you could then register that type, and so on. You'd only then have to new up (resolve) the last item in the chain and the rest would get automatically made by the container, when it sees a class constructor requires a type in knows about.
That was the most approachable introduction to the subject that I've ever seen. Thanks for posting this.
Thanks for the reply, after lots of research I’m actually going down the route of building a chrome extension that uses native messaging to “talk” to the app. That way I can actually search the DOM for the correct fields rather than just guessing with tabs etc 
 public ITCPListenerBuilder SetDataParser&lt;TParser&gt;(Func&lt;WhateverApplicationSettingIs, TParser&gt; parserFactory) where TParser : MessageParser { if (parserFactory is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(parserFactory)); } if (ApplicationSetting == null) { throw new NullReferenceException("Application Setting must be configured first"); } MessageParser = parserFactory(ApplicationSetting); return this; } As a stylistic matter: you probably shouldn't be throwing NullReferenceExceptions this way. InvalidOperationException may be more appropriate.

Everyone that says "you gotta try EF these days, it's pretty awesome now" - People told me that with EF2, EF3 and EF4. Every time, I was underwhelmed or just frustrated with how much work it took to get everything up and going. Dapper just allows me to make simple models and run them against parameterized queries or procs (yeah i do both) and be done with it. It was at EF5 ("Hey you gotta try EF5! It so much better) I just quit caring about it. Now I am hearing the same stories with EF6. Dapper ain't always the best, but it is lite (a very simple library, as the main component is some extension methods on a connection object) and \*we\* control how our SQL is executed every single time.
This was true many MS SQL versions ago, but if you're on a semi current version and using parameterized queries there will not be a performance difference.
I only use Dapper for read operations, plain SQL using SqlClient for everything else. Usually I set up a view on the SQL server with all joins and name the columns something fitting a property. Then I create a POCO matching the output from the view and use Dapper to populate it with data. If you are currently using merge statements for updates, that's going to be tough to compete with performance wise. I would not recommend trying to mess with that. Sending update statements on masse will not come close.
I've used msagl, and GraphSharp. Neither of them are too hard to understand. MSAGL only has forms control, graphSharp has wpf controls. &amp;#x200B;
Sorry to come here with a question, but this got me curious... Why not use System.Collections.Generic.List?
Well I can just was learning how the list class worked
It would be very useful for wringing value out of generics, but I get the impression that the current implementation makes it impractical to implement. It's probably not insurmountable to implement for static resolution, but it seems like it would be a real bear once run-time reflection comes into the picture.
I was asking about [qml.net](https://qml.net) sample. Eventually I built that sample in visual studio but I was not impressed. First there was a console window that showed some COM error at startup following with some scrolling text. Sample app window looked a bit weird with rounded buttons that did not react to mouse presses. It shows that UI is technically possible and most likely requires a lot of work and a lot of styling. Would have been OK demo 20 years ago. Maybe I am just spoiled. &amp;#x200B; Anyway, it is good to have one more UI option but Qt looks like an ugly baby. 
 public interface IIndirectCustructable&lt;TConstructorArgs&gt; { void Initialize(TConstructorArgs); } public abstract class RecordBase&lt;TConstructorArgs&gt; : IIndirectConstructable&lt;TConstructorArgs&gt; { private bool Initialized; public RecordBase() {} public void Initialize(TConstructorArgs args) { if(Initialized) return; InitializeImplementation(args); Initialized = true; } protected abstract void InitializeImplementation(TConstructorArgs args); } public static class RecordFactory { public static TRecord New&lt;TRecord, TConstructorArgs&gt;(TConstructorArgs args) where TRecord: IIndirectConstructable&lt;TConstructorArgs&gt;, new() { TRecord record = new TRecord(); record .Initialize(args); return record; } } Would something like this work for your use case?
I used to ask grandma, but then she died. ... I made myself sad.
Have you looked into entity component systems (ECS)?
What are you testing? The Web API or something internal to the server? I would normally recommend [BenchmarkDotNet](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/) but it doesn't really do WebAPI testing easily. Its more aimed at internal server performance than network performance.
If you use List.Remove(item) and you have no other references to the object then garbage collection will see to it when it is in the mood.
It would certainly be nice. My understanding is that the main roadblocks are 1. Requiring CLR changes to represent the constraint in IL and validate it at runtime 2. Requiring a new API that to create objects which takes into account static type information It's certainly doable, there just hasn't been sufficient impetus for it. I think the effective functionality might have been absorbed into other more ambitious language proposals such as shapes.
I'm actually testing a script that is called from Startup.cs, the problem is that this app is restarted very regularly. I'll take a look at that, thanks!
Have you checked out Stored Procedures? Helps to keep the SQL specific code in the actually database. Code: public async Task&lt;SeriesResult&lt;Show&gt;&gt; UserShowAddAsync(Show record) { try { await connection.OpenAsync(); cmd = CreateSqlCommandForSP("UserShowAdd"); cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("UserID", _userModel.CurrentUser.UserID); cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("TvdbID", record.Id); cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("TvdbName", record.SeriesName); cmd.Parameters.Add("ID", SqlDbType.Int).Direction = ParameterDirection.Output; await cmd.ExecuteNonQueryAsync(); record.UserShowID = int.Parse(cmd.Parameters["ID"].Value.ToString()); return new SeriesResult&lt;Show&gt; { Result = SQLResult.Success, Data = record }; } catch (Exception e) { _loggerService.CatchError(e.Message); return new SeriesResult&lt;Show&gt; { Result = SQLResult.ErrorHasOccured, Message = e.Message }; } finally { connection.Close(); } } Stored Procedure: USE[SeriesTracker] GO /****** Object: StoredProcedure [dbo].[UserShowAdd] Script Date: 16/10/2018 18:44:41 ******/ SET ANSI_NULLS ON GO SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON GO -- ============================================= -- Author: -- Create date: 04/02/2016 -- Description: Adds a show to a user -- ============================================= ALTER PROCEDURE[dbo].[UserShowAdd] @UserID INT, @TvdbID INT, @TvdbName VARCHAR(MAX), @ID INT OUTPUT AS BEGIN SET NOCOUNT ON DECLARE @SeriesID INT = (SELECT SeriesID FROM Series WHERE TvdbID = @TvdbID) IF @SeriesID IS NULL BEGIN INSERT INTO Series(TvdbID, Name) VALUES(@TvdbID, @TvdbName) SET @SeriesID = @@IDENTITY END INSERT INTO UserShow(UserID, SeriesID) VALUES(@UserID, @SeriesID) SET @ID = @@IDENTITY END The @ID param in the Stored Procedure as the ID of the new record which is then retrieved in the code like so: `int.Parse(cmd.Parameters["ID"].Value.ToString());`
Removed: Rule 4. `File.WriteAllText` will wipe out any existing content in the text file and start fresh. Thus you won't have duplicates. If, however, the issue is your windows security log is being trimmed and you don't want to lose those old logs, you'll have to do some dirty work yourself I think. You'd probably have to read/parse your log file to see what the last security log was and only add logs after that.
rad i was wondering what happened when i took stuff out of my list i was like,, is this a memory leak am i dead inside? is the world just an illusion?
Dapper isn't all roses and rainbows though. For example good luck with varchar indexed columns even though ado.net and ef handle these correctly (because dapper doesn't know about metadata and this has to pass your string in as nvarchar, thus your index performance is hosed)
No, I am learning myself?
So your suggestion would be to use the List from C#? rather using the code?
well, I was wondering how they worked, I assume the big problem is you cant delete these objects from memory unlike the Garbage Collector allows
Great work, I've wanted something like this for a long time. 
Why not just use `List&lt;T&gt;`? Also what's with the s prefix? 
&gt; I assume the big problem is you cant delete these objects from memory You assume wrong. There is no problem. The problem is already being solved by the garbage collector. If you're learning C# and you come from C++ then the first thing you should take to heart is: stop worrying about memory management.
&gt;I assume the big problem is you cant delete these objects from memory You assume wrong. There is no problem. The problem is already being solved by the garbage collector. I did link you the garbage collection topic. I just didn't want to tell you that you can call `GC.Collect()` in your code, because you sound like you might actually do it. If you're learning C# and you come from C++ then the first thing you should take to heart is: stop worrying about memory management. &gt;well, I was wondering how they worked [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4yaUd4hWzQ&amp;list=PLRwVmtr-pp07QlmssL4igw1rnrttJXerL&amp;index=12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4yaUd4hWzQ&amp;list=PLRwVmtr-pp07QlmssL4igw1rnrttJXerL&amp;index=12) Here's the .NET source code: [https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/collections/generic/list.cs,cf7f4095e4de7646](https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/collections/generic/list.cs,cf7f4095e4de7646)
If for WinForms I can recommend the Framework built-in System.Windows.Forms.DataVisualization.Charting namespace. 
I've had somewhat of a success grabbing path data from inkscape using the built in XML editor. Can't say it's very convenient, but it works.
&gt; you probably shouldn't be throwing NullReferenceExceptions this way [ArgumentException](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.argumentexception?view=netframework-4.7.2) exists for this very purpose.
In that case BenchmarkDotNet is definitely what you want to use to benchmark your code.
Sorry! It will be a WPF
My biggest issue with Qt and QML is the vague, nebulous nature of the license for Commercial Applications. I would love to use Qt and QML in my commercial applications but the license to Qt is too expensive and I have to bundle all dependencies with my distribution. I can't rely on the customer having the dependencies preinstalled. 
There is a coding style where people prefix the variable name with the type. In this case, 's' for 'string'. I don't use it but a lot of people do and even more beginner books teach it.
There is no way to check, to my knowledge; you just have to catch the Exception and then handle it. Personally I'd just catch the Exception and throw the file back into the queue if it's critical they be downloaded.
Sorry 
You can use it commercially, with the open source license, as long as you dynamically link.
If you export to XPS then open that file as a zip file, you can get to a file that is nicely formatted with path data rather than having all the additional inkscape metadata.
Your question is slightly confusing. To get the generated SQL query you can just use toString(): SOQL_834.toString(); If you can't access the database it's pretty obvious that you have to mock it. The internet is full of tutorials and guides about mocking web services and EF. A quick google search you will find a ton of stuff. One of many methods would be to use [SoapUI](https://www.soapui.org/soap-mocking/working-with-mockservices.html) for instance.
Hi guys I figured this out. My actual Incscape drawing was not really drawn in a way to use with C#. It was working but stroke and fill were not behaving like they should. I redrew my icon and now working the way I was expecting it to. Thanks for all the input.
Oh shoot you're absolutely right. Somehow I skipped over the fact that you're already using ArgumentException for the real parameter to the method.
Look at this section: private void button2_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { Form2 f = new Form2(); label1.Text = f.TextBoxValue; } When you click the button, two actions happen: * A new form is created and assigned to the variable "f". * A label is set to the value of the newly created form's text box. Based on just those two steps, do you see any issues that would cause you to not get an expected value from an existing form?
Yup, codebehind is 100% a part of the View. Here is a rough outline of a "classic" MVVM pattern in WPF/UWP: View (XAML/codebehind): Binding controls and other UI elements to public properties (in the form of data to display, or commands to call) of its respective ViewModel (the binding context). It also performs the necessary operations (like your `DisplayName` "The" issue) to properly display that data, often times via objects like the `IValueConverter` I mentioned, etc. ViewModel: Home of the business logic. If it were a calculator, it does the math operations. Typically exposes `ICommand`s for operations that it can do, and data, via public properties, that its view might want to display. The key here is that the ViewModel should have no knowledge of a view that might bind to it, or how exactly that view might want to display it. It doesn't know that a display name needs a "the" in front of it, it just exposes the property. Within a ViewModel is where you call services to retrieve the appropriate data, and perform the appropriate operations. Caching could be done here, or in a service related to that, depending on other factors. MVVM is designed to keep all of the concerns separate because better encapsulation of all of the objects and tasks in an application make them 1) easier to test, and 2) easier to replace in the event that multiple platforms require different implementations. And I should clarify, some people will interface ViewModels (like [here](https://blog.qmatteoq.com/the-mvvm-pattern-dependency-injection/)), but with all of the IOC/DI frameworks out there and their power, that seems excessive. Unless someone can chime in as to some big thing I'm missing, you can just instantiate the service from the container in the ViewModel's constructor. Model: Data models. Fairly self-explanatory. Should probably just be an object with properties. Hopefully that helps. And the reason I asked about the controllers is because that generally is part of MVC or some other paradigm, instead of MVVM.
The garbage collector will handle memory for you. Once there are no references to it it will be removed during a collection. 99.9% of the time you don't need to worry about it.
Yeah, it's called Hungarian notation. I don't particularly like it, but I think it's fine for beginners. It'll help them get used to intellisense, and makes them keep thinking about the type of the data.
Thanks for responding. Unfortunately ToString() generates an error since the `DataContext` queryable object will either not emit SQL (if the object is a `List&lt;T&gt;`) or will be null (if it is a `Table&lt;T&gt;`). &gt; If you can't access the database it's pretty obvious that you have to mock it. While it may be obvious to you, I'm afraid it's not obvious to me. If I were to do this myself, I would just parse the LINQ expression tree; the reflected object definition should be sufficient to write the entire SOQL query. That said, I think as I'm typing this I'm realizing that part of my assumption that there is a solution is based on needing SOQL output (where nearly all the joins are implicit) and not SQL; I can see how emitting SQL would require more information than could be derived from the class metadata without at least data annotations. I think I had a suspicion about that (hence the bit about missing keys) but it only crystallized when I thought through why you felt it was obvious that I would need to mock the database.
Why not use EF? You can still use LINQ with EF datasets, there is even querty optimization. 
either way can work, but I'm not sure what you're trying to do. are you trying to do a running total or take the percentage diff of columns a and b on table 1 and put that next to percentage diff of c and d on table 2? if so, in c# ``` var dt1 = GetDataTable1(); var dt2 = GetDataTable2(); var results = dt.AsEnumerable().Zip(dt2.AsEnumerable()).Select((rowa, rowb) =&gt; new { A = Pecentage(rowa[a], rowa[b]), B = percentage(rowb[c], rowb[d]).ToList(); ```
The Garbage Collector generally know when object in memory have no more references to them and then releases their resources. As said before, once you remove an object instance from a List&lt;T&gt;, as long you do not have any other reference to it, the Garbage Collector will take care of it shortly.
&gt; Requiring CLR changes This means that .NET Framework will probably never get it. .NET Core could.... but they aren't going to add a C# feature that only works in .NET Core. So yea, the outlook isn't great.
What's with everyone just posting links to github without the minimum effort to describe what the hell it is they are linking to?
&gt; they aren't going to add a C# feature that only works in .NET Core. That's the sad state of affairs for default interface implementations, no?
Because I'm not building an app from scrap, I'm trying to address pain points in an existing app. I've never done an EF migration with a Salesforce database, but it's something I'd definitely consider down the road.
Eric Lippert had a good reply from back in the day https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9741211/restricting-a-generic-type-parameters-to-have-a-specific-constructor/9741812#9741812 That said I'd still love to have it if only for constructors, but I understand the concerns in his part 2
^this If you ever find yourself needing to resize an array, that's a code smell indicating that you should be using a `List&lt;T&gt;` instead.
Your sql statement is wrong Try something like INSERT INTO MyTable(Name, Address, PhoneNo) OUTPUT INSERTED.ID VALUES ('Yatrix', '1234 Address Stuff', '1112223333') Instead of the output inserted at the end. It does work Gewoon even stackoverflow gebruiken kan ook https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10999396/how-do-i-use-an-insert-statements-output-clause-to-get-the-identity-value#10999467
Thanks, unfortunately I have to resize the way I did as it’s for an assignment for my class. As to the problem with my program I figured it out, I forgot to make sName = SearchIt() Thanks for all the suggestions though. I’ll keep them in mind for future projects.
I just had an experience at my job where one of the engineers was complaining about how bad SQL EF was putting out. I loaded both in ssms and showed him that his "pretty" hand written one had a worse execution plan than EF's
If database tables are both input and output for relatively simple calculations, C# (or any other client technology) should not be used for processing. Keep these calculations inside stored procedure and only use client code to kick off that procedure.
I thought it was fixed that default interface implementation was gonna be in C# 8.0. Or did I miss something on this front? 
Sorry this is my first reddit post. If you wouldn’t mind what are monospaced code blocks? 
Before I make it even more confusing for both of us, I have to admit that I have no clue of salesforce. But if they are using EF this stuff should work out of the box. I even tested .toString() before posting my answer and it worked as expected. It could be a Salesforce thing, but I doubt it is. If you are using EF6+ .toString() will work 100%. Don't forget to include the [System.Data.Entity](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.entity(v=vs.113).aspx) namespace. Just write the query and don't convert it to anything. Don't use methods like .toList() on the result object. Just directly use toString() on the result. These queries are lazy and will not try to retrieve any data anyway, unless you actually start using them. Its just basic lazy-evaluation. To actually mock the database on a EF level, you can just mock the DbCotext with [Moq](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/ef6/fundamentals/testing/mocking) or some other mocking library. From the salesforce documentation there is some information on mocking the web service: [Test Web Service Callouts](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_callouts_wsdl2apex_testing.htm) I just don't know if that is the right thing for you.
It will be EVENTUALLY removed from memory. While process has plenty of memory available, GC will not even kick in, which is by design.
there's no real way to fully guarantee you'll always have access. even if you wrote code to check if the file is locked it could always become locked between your check and when you go to modify the file. so, the 'standard' approach is what /u/midri suggested. just catch the appropriate exception(s) and either retry if you really need that operation or discard and wait for the next update to try again.
Look up the formatting guide and it should explain. If not put the code in pastebin or something that's formatted
From what I can infer about what OP is doing, I agree that this is the right answer. You should even be able to encapsulate the procedure nicely into a C# method and abstract out the database part.
Sounds like an easy win for keeping it all inside the stored procedure to me. :)
Just gotta figure out how to get it written out then. Ive done it in MS Access VBA, though its a bit different now with SSMS and SQL. Especially when its also a dynamic SQL and I'm very much a beginner lol. Have only learned SQL about &lt;4 months ago :P
Too bad. :-/ Thanks anyway though, talking it through helped me understand why it wasn't possible (so I can stop looking). On the bright side, short of switching to EF for Salesforce (kind of a herculean task to take on with no specific benefit in mind other than ease of use), I think I might be able to swap out some of the existing infrastructure with [LinqToSalesforce](https://rflechner.github.io/LinqToSalesforce), and I think the code from that will look a lot like EF code--enough that the eventual conversion will be less of a hassle. Thanks again.
Nothing is certain about C# 8. 
While I normally respect his opinion, I strongly disagree with him in this case. Yes, it would require new IL concepts in order to be performant. But that alone isn't reason enough to discredit the idea and his other objections don't stand up.
ironically, reddit doesnt do ``` for formatting code.. so you have to paste your code in a text editor, indent each line with 4 spaces/tab, then you can have string str = "string"; str += "formatted lel"; str += "lolreddit";
If you have direct access to the database you can probably let VS generate all the EF POC and stuff for you (Database first instead of code first approach). But I have no clue what kind of mess you will get. :) I know nothing about salesforce. You have basically just confused Linq with Linq-to-SQL which is part EF. Maybe you could try LinqPad and see if there is a feature for this kind of use case. I am sorry I couldn’t help to solve this issue.

what about named semaphore ?
ypu are downloading the same files many time ? In this case you can optimize your code Your are downloading different files and using the same temp ? Let's generate different temp name files for each download You are downloading new version of files that could been in use ? You can use a file system watcher and a try/open/catch/retry mechamism Your question is so generic that is diffficult to answer, a little more details ? Btw from your very general description I smell design isssues
your application doesn't control file access, the operating system does. any number of things could wind up locking the file even if nothing in your program is locking the file.
No worries. Linq-to-SQL isn't actually EF at all; it's an ADO.net feature. But yeah I guess without a database schema it doesn't really mean anything.
Do yourself a favor and do not use the DataTable type. Use another ORM like Entity Framework to read from your database into strong types. It's a nightmare to maintain old ADO code (DataTable, DataRow, etc.) and you'll have magic strings everywhere to track columns that are easy to screw up. Don't do this to yourself. It's a crap pattern left over from VB days. You may also just be able to write a stored procedure to do the math for you, or a use a view. Almost any analytic can be done inline with a set based query (i.e. the view answer) so you don't even need to use T-SQL, temp tables, or the like. Writing automated tests is slightly harder than doing it in C# though. If you can give more detail on the calculation you're trying to do and explain how your data is normalized it may be trivial to answer how to do this. 
Short answer: System.GC.Collect(); Correct answer: Don't do that unless you completely understand exactly what it means, why you shouldn't do it and have a good reason why to do it nonetheless, which you don't have if you need to ask.
SELECT &gt; MERGE is likely a very good solution here. Testing is a bit more difficult but possible. This likely can be done in a single set based query (as opposed to procedural, i.e. just using SELECT ... MERGE without any T-SQL commands, variables, temp tables, etc) and will outperform other solutions. 
That's the issue though what exactly does dynamically link mean. I mean most everything in C# is dynamically link by some definitions in that they are dlls that reside next to the Executable but not in the definition. When I consulted with my contract and legal person at my company they tried to find a legal definition of dynamic and static linking. They found that in some instances the way C# references dlls maybe construed as static linking and that depending on the language and situation there is a lot of gray area in the exact differences. 
i guess it all depends on whether you want to be defensive. i've developed internal tools all my career and our environments are maintained by a separate IT organization. there have been a few times where they deployed antivirus out onto our vms or updated antivirus and forgot to check if certain vms were exempt or whatever. easy mistake, easy solve, but would cause apps built assuming full control of the environment to error or crash versus apps built with exception handling logic to continue working albeit more slowly.
From the remarks section of the docs on the Resize Method: &gt;This method allocates a new array with the specified size, copies elements from the old array to the new one, and then replaces the old array with the new one. array must be a one-dimensional array. This is why that method requires you to specify "ref" to indicate the array parameter is being passed by reference. This is so that method can reassign that parameter to the reference of the newly created array. Since your other routines do not accept the array by reference, that is handled by sending in a copy of the reference. For example, when RemoveIt(sName, sSearch, i); is called, the sName Array reference is copied to a new variable and that is passed in. When you use Array.Size, that *copy* gets passed by reference to the Resize routine, and then reassigned to the reference of the new array created. But, the original reference- the reference of sName - remains unchanged- it still points at the original array. Basically you need to accept the array parameter by reference in your routines for this to function as you expect.
in c++, you are responsible for managing the lifetimes of objects explicitly. If you're doing it correctly, most of it gets handled automatically by either the object lifetime (RAII) or with smart pointers. in c#, you don't have to worry about it in the same way. if nobody holds a reference to an object anymore, it just goes away. the GC knows about every object in existence and can find out unreachable objects, including unreachable cycles (cycles can be a pain in c++). Also, you probably don't want to be using "object" everywhere. for linkedlists of value types (primitives and structs) you'd be boxing everywhere. You'd want to make your type generic, a la LinkedList&lt;T&gt;. In cases where you can't assign null, you'd do "default(T)", or with newer language versions just "default".
This won't work because the files are being downloaded from a remote server. The locks would be held on the remote server, not something that the client has any knowledge of.
this is the correct approach, but just make sure of two things: 1) You need some kind of backoff time. Attempting the download 10ms after the first fails has the potential to turn into a denial of service. This can be a hard thing to accomplish if your queue needs to be durable. It sounds like it already isn't, so you maybe can get away with something like "Task.Delay(timespan).ContinueWith(AddToQueue())". You don't want to await that since you'd be blocking the other potential good things in the queue. 2) You have to give up eventually. Otherwise your queue has the potential to fill up with "bad" files that can never be downloaded.
It's hard to be too specific with interfaces. Resolution of dependencies is generally a function of the concretions. One rule of thumb I use is that you almost never "new up" anything you defined within any class you're writing. There are a few exceptions, with Factories being the most notable. If you're doing a Factory, though, it's because you need a multiple choice instantiation (e.g. you save blue cars to a SQL database but red cares are exported to XML, so you need a factory to know what type of repository to create). Even then, the factory should have an interface definition. If you're just going for vanilla dependency injection/interface-based programming, look to the composition root -- the Main method on the console or Startup on ASP.NET. That's where you want to be composing your dependencies. Looking at just what you have posted, I'd probably new up a MessageParser, pass it into a new TCPListener instance, and then pass that into whatever the next layer of your app is (controller, form, etc.). You can do this manually or with an IoC container. Either way, the concept is the same. As a guide, think about how you'd isolate a test on what you're trying to build. You don't have to test each class separately, but you should avoid hitting databases, services, even things on the file system. This is why TDD is helpful, even if you write crappy tests -- it helps you structure your other code better. One trick I've learned is that I don't directly call the ApplicationSettings or ConfigurationManager, and haven't for probably a decade. I create an IConfiguration interface with well-name properties and have a concretion of that wrap the built-in settings. I started doing it to hide the magic strings, but ended up loving it because I can mock out my settings for testing and can run tests against behaviors that might differ between production and development (for example). Anyway, to get to the point, I'm not seeing anything here that warrants a generic. Just better structuring of DI. Hope that helps.
Dotnet standard, framework or core ?
This. This whole branch. I've been doing development for over 20 years and .NET for 15 of those (basically since 1.1 beta). Hardware has changed, but too many folks are still trying to optimize like we're running on big iron. Stored Procs *might* be faster -- maybe -- but you also lose the ability to do any unit testing against anything in them (and don't tell me it's just CRUD, it's never just CRUD). I, flat out, do not use stored procs. Never say never, but I'm not doing Monte Carlo simulations, either -- even if I was, the speed requirement would probably be better met other ways like calling to C++ and slaving a GPU, may God have mercy on your soul. As ToeGuitar says, gauge the openness to change. If you're dealing with folks who outrank you, have ego in the game, and have veto power, you're just pissing into the wind and probably torpedoing your advancement. If they're actually open, though, knock yourself out.
Yeah I think I would rather go for an Init() interface method vs using reflection. Curious to see why OP didn’t go for this method.
Framework, but the problem was not in the code, the company said they don't have the "know how" to work with Linux so they just did not support it even though their API said it did. 
And they forgot to say that before I spent two weeks trying to make it work
I don't Visual Studio in hand now but you can try to swicth to DotNet Core (which is multiplatform instead of emulated on Mono) and using Raspberry IO as library
Well, there's thousands of ways to run code and core/framework is crucial information. 
Does it run slow the first time or every time? 
It's also slow.
Unrelated to OP, but my boss at work (principal developer, used .NET from the beginning) thought we had found a good reason to call gc.collect I don't remember the details, but it was a weird memory growth issue where it seemed like things were not getting cleaned up as quickly we wanted, despite memory constraints and of course, no references to the objects. Application seemingly performed faster and with a lower memory footprint. We were tempted to leave it, but iirc we were using gc.collect in a loop (that also created objects needed for one iteration of the loop), which is also I'll advised? Anyway, we read up on how it could lead to memory fragmentation and what not, so we took it out. Closest I have come to seeing a need for it. Though, I do actually feel that was a genuine need that was not appropriately satisfied by the GC algorithm, it's just that calling gc.collect was also not a good solution?
Assuming you aren't doing anything wacky with unsafe then memory will be freed when no references exist in scope to the element in question. It's not about the list logic itself, it's about references.
How does it connect? If it’s USB try SerialPortStream. You have to compile a native library on the Pi but after that it just works. 
A caveat on this. Leaving aside the fact that stored procs are much harder to maintain over time, in most cases, database server processing is significantly more expensive than client resources. If you need to scale out your app at all client side processing is a godsend even if it feels slower at small scale. 
Way less complex. WPF has XAML, bindings, view models, observables, styles, etc.. It's a lot more code than the equivelent WinForms app, and for enterprise users/developers the flashyness doesn't matter. We want simple to build, simple to maintain.
But that’s the thing. Bindings et al come with the promise that while harder to code especially when you’re inexperienced with them, they are _much_ simpler to maintain in the long run. The “stuff everything in one class” WinForms approach isn’t as scalable and sustainable. As for styles and some other aspects, I do feel WPF went overboard.
Other than _probably_ getting non-nullable reference types since that prototype is fairly far along, no feature is actually (publicly) a *lock* for 8.0.
Well then it's a good thing that wasn't the only reason he gave.
 if (File.Exists("filename")) { var content = File.ReadAllText("filename"); } That ReadAllText call can still throw a FileNotFoundException. The operating system controls file access, not your application. The file could be deleted between these two calls. It can **always** happen that the file situation is not the way your application expects it and you need to be able to handle this.
[Doing `new T()` calls Activator.CreateInstance at runtime anyway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.activator.createinstance?redirectedfrom=MSDN&amp;view=netframework-4.7.2#System_Activator_CreateInstance__1)
That's what I thought. Which pretty much negates any objection to having other constructor constraints.
You don't say what your problem is but I'm going with NullReferenceException? 
Whoa. VM, domain, and infrastructure shouldn't be in the same assemblies as your views? That's news to me.
How are games published on the Store then?
There are few cases where using an array is a good idea. The System.Collection.Generics.List&lt;T&gt; linked list is the way to go. In general, Generics are the always the way to go. When they showed up in 3.. or 3.5.. whenever it was was my best day as a programmer ever. So many problems and structural issues just... disappeared. I never refactored code with as much zeal as I did our code base after Generics showed up... Weak typing of collections had been a bit of an Achille's Heal up until then.
My bet is the 'designer' in vs2017 is just the blend engine.

You are right. I posted it here because used to use confluent kafka library, but they reintroduce the same bug with every version of their library. I tried to find any alternative and it was kafka-net, I built it under .net core 2.1 version and trying using it. Also from my perspective kafka-net is easier to test compare to confluent kafka.
I replied [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/9oagf3/kafka_net_core_library/e7x8xiq)
Don't expect this to happen any time soon. But you can now write windows only WPF applications in .net core now IIRC.
It all comes down to what you're targeting. Are you happy with the look of WPF applications? Can they do what you actually want? Are they deployable where you need to deploy them - e.g. Windows Sever 2012/Windows 8/Windows 10? WPF has been "replaced" by UWP, but UWP has a bunch of limitations which may make it unsuitable for you, such as requiring Windows 10. Also WPF and Winforms are still being actively maintained by MS - your applications are not going to stop being supported for a long time, and when those technologies do die out you're use of MVVM should mean replacing the frontend with whatever is the latest flavour of the month (whether that's web, UWP or whatever) should be straightforward. 
If you're interested in cross-platform with C#, check out this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/9o8w1r/crossplatform_gui_development_with_net_core_using/ Also, take a peak at Electron if you're interested in cross platform apps using html, css and js.
WPF is best windows desktop UI framework. The catch here is "desktop" and "windows". Nowadays, desktop applications are becomming extremely rare and most users prefer web or mobile application . Second is that WPF is windows-only, and might limit usage of your software. There is UWP, but even MS is stopping to talk about it as successor due to it's failure to capture mobile and tablet market.
Laptops and 2-1 convertibles are mobile desktop computers, and the large majority of them run Windows.
If you are only focusing on Windows, WPF is just fine when targeting all versions, UWP is the way forward when targeting Windows 10 or later.
And what have you tried to actually do this problem? This sounds like homework which is something you need to attempt first yourself.. we aren't just going to write a solution for you ;)
I just want to tell you good luck. We're all counting on you.
1: Show your code 2. What do you mean by 'split the numbers'? There is multiple ways to interpret this. 3. What is reversing a number? That isn't a well defined function either. 4. Array of ...?
Best as I can tell, it won't really be a separate version; rather, .NET Core is gaining a compatibility layer to make WPF work.
It's great for windows desktop unless you need high performance, like rendering 60 FPS of live video without glitching. I would recommend NoesisGui (which attempts to match WPFs API exactly and even uses their documentation and tools, like VS blend) or AvaloniaUI (BETA) to preserve cross platform potential or Blazor (BETA).
Don't need it anymore, I figured it out. Thanks for all your help and encouragement!
It’s infinite consuming and producing bug, you can find the description in their repo. Regarding config, I guess they changed it in new version but it s still in beta.

Are you in control of the DOM? If so I’d recommend adding an Id or Class attribute to the dropdown which would make it a lot easier to select out. If you’re not in control of the DOM then I would suggest looking into using the CssSelector because XPath is pretty gross. Personal opinions aside instead of using Thread.Sleep you should use the Until method of the WebDriverWait class which takes in a function. There is an example at the bottom of this page https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/dotnet/html/T_OpenQA_Selenium_Support_UI_WebDriverWait.htm. You could write your own lamda function inside the Until call (something like d =&gt; d.FindElementBy(By.CssSelector(‘select li.selected’)).Text.Contains(‘value’) or use one of the helpers provided by the ExpectedConditions class ElementToBeSelected perhaps. The docs for the ExpectedConditions class are here https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/dotnet/html/T_OpenQA_Selenium_Support_UI_ExpectedConditions.htm. Without seeing more of the DOM and more of your code (you say you’re using ElementClickable somewhere) I’m afraid I can’t provide much more guidance. One thing I would recommend looking into if you’re planning on having this code around for a while is the Page Object Model pattern https://www.swtestacademy.com/page-object-model-c/. Apologies for the poor formatting I’m on mobile. 
I am almost 100% sure the massive shitstorm of putting logic in interfaces proposal contributes massively to that.
It's worth noting that there are plenty of enterprise apps that still use them.
WPF is still widely used, I believe Visual Studio is written in WPF. I use it to write little in house apps at my work, I like it.
For your invormation we are NOT using P/Invoke for DirectX interop. We are consuming SharpDX library, that rewrites IL to make calls via `calli` instruction, that basicallly does a function pointer call without any additional overhead, so there is no difference between consuming DirextX COM interfaces from C++ and C#.
And there are many COBOL and Enterprise Java applications too. What is your point?
I would look into Electron with Angular, personally
WPF and Avalonia are very similar when it comes to layout controls etc., If you have further questions please give us a chat @ [https://gitter.im/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia](https://gitter.im/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) and we might be able to get you started :) 
I think /u/AlliNighDev 's point was that if OP wants to get into Enterprise app programming, there's a healthy market for it. Some people want to program for fun. Others for money. It's a legit answer, imho.
This is true. We switched to WPF around 2010 because that was the direction MS was pushing. Silverlight was slated for the graveyard, and winforms was supposed to follow suit as soon as WPF took over. Silverlight did die, but winforms never went anywhere. I learned to love some things about WPF, but I find it's more complicated to execute "properly".
I think the sticky part is a broader question is, "Are Desktop applications still the way to go?" Ignoring that issue, WPF is not "a waste". If you understand MVVM, and you understand XAML, then UWP isn't a major change. It's at least been true, for 3 of the 4 frameworks that MS said obsolete and replace WPF, that XAML has been constant. And if it turns out desktop clients aren't the way, the pattern is very common. Android uses XML-like markup in a very similar way. HTML and JS interact in a very similar way. While different markup and different application code is used, almost every modern UI framework is built on the same principles: * UI code is relegated to a markup language that does only the logic related to user interaction and displaying state. * Application logic is implemented in a language that expresses state. * Some middle layer connects state to the UI, and relays user information from the UI to the application logic. So don't be afraid to dabble in other things like UWP or HTML/JS, even if your primary focus is WPF. You can learn things from the other places, too, and you might end up landing in their neighborhood if MS suddenly changes their mind about UWP like it did about WPF and Silverlight.
It really depends on your needs. If you need it to be compatible with Win7 then WPF is the way to go, if you do not need Win7 I generally would favor UWP. Luckily WPF and UWP are very similar so the learning curve should be small.
What terrible advice. Your telling OP to ignore a 15 old, up-to-date framework, and instead use fucking API replicas and cross-platform betas? Are you kidding me? Do you also recommend WINE to Windows developers?
&gt; Many of the capabilities and component types that were the strength of WPF are now available in the browser and associated HTML/ JavaScript/CSS/SVG standards and implementations Yes, with only 1000 times the cost in CPU/battery, only 100 times slower and you have to make "browser specific tweek". Please, web, is for compatibility, not performance or usability. 
&gt; Is web really though the solution to every problem? *inhales* Noooooooooooooo! It's only the best solution if you want to sell cloud services.
Yeah, if you hate your users.
Why does that bother you?
You know it's funny to read your remarks that desktop apps are becoming rare and being replaced with web apps. I started my career 21 years ago writing classic ASP and people said the exact same thing. Web has its place - so do traditional desktop applications. Outside of very specialized and or limited web apps the heavy lifting applications are still desktop apps.
Use WPF for now. Eventually (5 yrs?) a framework will allow you to do all the things you can do in WPF, but also be cross-platform. Blazor/Xamarin aren't there yet, but as soon as something can truly replace WPF, that's the one to learn next.
WPF standard is coming in .net core 3 (see https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/05/07/net-core-3-and-support-for-windows-desktop-applications/), but as a previous poster said, the core tenets of WPF are going to be around for a long time, whether its UWP, Xamarin, or WPF. They're all running the same concept of markup based UI using a MVVM focused design. Don't go running to a 3rd party just yet, learn WPF, then afterwards supplement your knowledge with popular alternatives. 
Yes. Cloud servers are just servers. 
What would you use instead of WPF to start a current project?
&gt; desktop applications are becomming extremely rare and most users prefer web or mobile application How do you know that most users prefer web or mobile apps? How can users prefer "mobile apps" in desktop if mobile apps are for mobile devices? what about all the desktop version of mobile apps, like telegram, spotify or whatsapp? I think you are mixing things, desktop applications, in general, aren't "extremely rare". People are using "mobile apps" because they are using their phones, mobile apps are for mobile devices (ios/android), and you can't run that apps in desktop. I guess you are confusing that desktop application can be made using web frameworks, not only with .net frameworks like windows forms or wpf, but it is not the aame than saying "desktop application are extremely rare", desktop application aren't rare at all, and if you go to enterprise side, you can find a lot of desktop development is using wpf or even winforms.
&gt; WPF is best windows desktop UI framework. &gt;The catch here is "desktop" and "windows". Nowadays, desktop applications are becomming extremely rare and most users prefer web or mobile application . Second is that WPF is windows-only, and might limit usage of your software. Nothing bad to say about WPF. One compromise to be Windows / Linux / Mac and Desktop / Web flexible that I think has potential is ASP.Net Core MVC with the new `IHostedService`. On Windows you can run a web app in an `IHostedService` set up as a windows service and HOSTS redirect `https://myapp` to your port on localhost. Network round trips that never leave your NIC are crazy fast, HTML / CSS / Javascript are ubiquitous, and you can still do any heavy processing on the local "server". One of the benefits is never having to worry about controls / threading deadlock issues. Not a big enough Linux or Mac user to know the equivalent, but there's always containers. 
It's fine if you only want to support Windows, and want to reach the largest audience of Windows users. I've been happy with [Eto](https://github.com/picoe/Eto) which is similar but cross-platform and wraps WPF or WinForms under the hood.
Arent slack and vscode (and cypress) and so many other great apps using electron? Can reuse most of the web codes for web, PWA, and hybrid mobile also, NativeScript, what's not to like? Why learn and test and support WPF, iOS, android, macOS seperate code bases unless u really needed to.
Slack and WhatsApp are using Electron for their desktop apps. Not sure what the reasoning is for people hating on it. Anyone care to share? I haven't checked it out yet.
Thanks for the clear answer.
extremely rare is a massive exaggeration.
