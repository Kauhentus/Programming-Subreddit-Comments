I'll give it a download tonight! Thank you :)
yeah, good point. to get the type of return list behavior i'm thinking about from languages like PHP or Python, you'd need the objects you assign them to to be mutable, or at least decompose to individual variables in the outer scope, which is what `out var` does.
I'm thinking during an "oh crap" moment that's in-between check-ins. As part of that, I'd assume this extension works between VS sessions (e.g. it crashes, you lose power, etc.), but I haven't read up on it to confirm. Of course, since it's an extension, if you don't think you need it there's no reason for you to install it.
&gt;LINQed Property getters, if you're too busy to write Property { get { return stuff; } } Can you give example of this? I don't understand.
You can write &gt; Property { get { return stuff; } } as &gt; Property =&gt; stuff; 
totally agree. i would also add C# will also attract more employment opportunities than VB
VB.Net is a legacy language. Drop it and go straight for the C#. Since you're self-proclaimed Linux fanboy why do you go for the Microsoft technologies? Java is an enterprise language directly competing with C# and it runs well on your favorite OS. True, C# is more advanced and comfortable to use but Java gets the job done. Remember it takes much more to develop the software than knowing the programming language. edit: typo
This is the method I've used, it's effective. Have you used JSon.net, if so how does it compare?
You've already decided on C#, but I thought I'd also mention that there are other technologies that are compatible with C# .net/mono, but not VB.net. Off the top of my head, both [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com/) and [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/) are programmed in C# but not VB.
Step up: vandalizing a performing arts school.
Nope.
~~VB.Net is as sister to C# as Vista (still supported) is sister to 8.1.~~ edit: Allright guys, I stand corrected. VB.Net truly is a sister language to C#.
&gt;Have you ever found yourself wishing you could roll back a few hours to a piece of code you had working but have made changes to? You were “in the flow” and you haven’t checked anything in to your source control system (or perhaps weren’t using source code control on your project)?
Something tells me you don't actually work day to day in software. (Or you haven't for a very long time) Shit happens. This is one more layer of protection that requires no action from the developer. 
This is incorrect, it is still currently developed alongside C# (they are essentially the same), not just supported. You may be referring to VB, not VB.Net.
Thanks for correcting me. I thought VB.Net is supported just enough to stay alive but in fact it offers almost the same features as C#.
Rubbish. Both compilers were just re-written. Matching architecture but implemented in their own language. I'm a C# dev so I don't really care but VB is no second class language and is being actively developed by Microsoft.
I've coded in both, and honestly I'm not saying c# is better. But 2 advantages to c# for you. 1. you already know the c syntax. 2. Googling for examples and help is way easier with c#. (just type 'c# your issue') 
No problem, we are here to learn! Luckily the programming subs are much more civil than the scary reddit world in general...
Wouldnt my vandalism be a form of performance art? Would not my self-expression upon this school be a teaching moment for the students, and therefore, the opposite of vandalism? I submit to you that it is therefore impossible to vandalize a performing arts school 
&gt; A friend of a friend writes code directly in MSIL ... why?
Explain .NET ghetto please?
If you want an easier path to a job, C#.
I have. I am using a combination of RestSharp and JSON.Net for a frontend for a legacy backend system written in Delphi. Delphi's equivalent of WebAPI (Datasnap) uses some serialization policies that doesn't immidiately lend themselves to deserialization in C#. Here the JSON.Net frameworks really helps with picking the objects you need out of the somewhat cluttered datasnap return values. JSON.Net is a very rich framework with every possible tool you could ever need for reading and writing JSON, but it doesn't contain a REST client. So you need some other way to actually call the API and then feed the results to JSON.Net. RestSharp is a pretty good choice for that.
I'd really love to know the answer to this question. I wonder if the person isn't on a team or isn't in a situation where productivity is important.
He works for Microsoft writing low-level high-performance code, and wants/needs the control that directly choosing the opcodes gives him. His case is not typical. ;) 
I've been doing this all the long way around so! I just use &gt; HttpWebRequest GETRequest =(HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(url); &gt; GETRequest.Method = "GET"; &gt; etc For connecting to a REST api. I'll give both of those a try in my next project, thanks!
Well, that totally explains it. :)
So the VB.net compiler is also getting the roslyn treatment? 
It has. The teams have stopped work on the previous compilers, apart from bug fixes for current use apparently. 
I might be way off base, but I feel like with C# being so strongly typed combined with VS being such a fantastic IDE, the code tends to just write itself... Our internal "developer" uses VB and whenever I look at his code I feel sick... 
Wow not sure what all the hate is for this extension, it looks really nice. Its basically git style commits on every save, but won't spam up your actual commit history with any unnecessary changes. And since it doesn't require git you can use it with TFS source control and others (or none... yikes!)
&gt; The entire reason for the existence of VB.NET was to make life easier for devs who were transitioning from VB6 to the .NET Framework. That's my story exactly. VB6 -&gt; VB.Net -&gt; C#. I'll run into a VB.Net position once in a while when browsing job postings, but the vast majority of .Net jobs want C#. 
I just set up Steam OS today and tried to install mono: desktop@steamos:~$ sudo apt-get install mono-complete [sudo] password for desktop: Reading package lists... Done Building dependency tree Reading state information... Done Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable distribution that some required packages have not yet been created or been moved out of Incoming.

And if you can do c#, you can do vb.net from my experiences.
C#
Please don't learn VB.NET, it was only provided as a means to pull the VB guys over when they released .NET.
Sorry if your goal is to get on the Linux platform stay away from C#. It's a great language and I use it myself for everything I can, but as a hiring manager that deploys to Linux... HR will filter you out if all you have on your resume is C#. Java is pretty much the only way to go. Granted I'm not talking about your skill as a programmer, I'm just letting you know what will help you get hired into the environment you want to work in. 
I disagree, Mono is quite mature now and ASP.NET MVC 4 works out of the box on Mono. My blog is built with C# and hosted on Linux. 
Absolutely, if he wants to work with the Linux platform, and those positions are available where he is. I was just trying to answer his question with regards to C# vs VB.NET.
In general, if I see a job listing for a VB.NET position, I find it's safe to assume there's a whole lot of legacy VB6 behind the scenes they're not telling you about.
With visual studio, intellisense does the majority of your coding! Great ide
C# doesn't have a future, sorry.
Could you elaborate on architecture, structure and tool? I spent a weekend trying to get a c#/mvc3 project set up on Linux, and just could not do it.
What would you guys recommend in the .NET world to learn? 
C# was made for the .NET framework.
Sure! tl;dr: [Everything is on Github if you want to dig around](https://github.com/Daniel15/Website) The site was originally a PHP website that I converted to C# (the C# code ended up being a *lot* cleaner and faster than the PHP code). The site was built in Visual Studio 2010 and consists of the following components: - ASP.NET MVC 4 + Razor 2 - [ServiceStack ORMLite](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite) with MySql.Data for data access layer - [SimpleInjector](http://simpleinjector.codeplex.com/) for IoC / Dependency injection - [DotLESS](http://www.dotlesscss.org/) for CSS preprocessing - [ELMAH](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/) for error logging - [Combres](https://github.com/buunguyen/combres) for JS and CSS minification and combination (although I've been meaning to switch it to [Cassette](http://getcassette.net/) instead all running on top of Mono (originally 3.0.2, now 3.2.5) and Nginx. Here is the live site: http://dan.cx/ and http://dan.cx/blog All [source code is on Github](https://github.com/Daniel15/Website), including [the Nginx configuration](https://github.com/Daniel15/Website/blob/master/Daniel15.Web/nginx.conf) and Web.config file. Some hints I can think of off the top of my head: - Do **not** start with the ASP.NET MVC "internet" template, it adds a whole bunch of random stuff you may not even want. Instead, start from the empty template. This will give you a clean slate. If you need anything from the internet template, copy it manually and test it - Do not deploy `Microsoft.Web.Infrastructure.dll`, as Mono has its own implementation. If using Visual Studio, set "Copy Local" to `false` for this reference. - Use a proper deployment method rather than just copying and pasting the whole project folder. From Visual Studio, you can build and deploy to a temporary folder, then rsync the temporary folder to your Linux server. This can be automated via MSBuild. Doing a proper deployment like this means you only copy the files needed by the server (your production server should **not** have .cs or .csproj files on it, as the whole site will be precompiled) Let me know if you have any other questions :) Edit: One thing I don't have on Github is the Mono service configuration. I'm using [supervisord](http://supervisord.org/) to launch Mono and its configuration looks like this: [fcgi-program:mono] command=/usr/local/bin/fastcgi-mono-server4 /applications=dan.cx:/:/var/www/dan.cx/site/ user=www-data socket=unix:///var/run/mono/mono.socket socket_owner=www-data supervisord handles starting Mono when the server starts, and restarting it if it ever crashes. I have [memmon and httpok supervisord plugins](http://superlance.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) watching it and restarting it if it ever eats heaps of memory or returns a non-200 response to a non-cached "alive" check page.
It stands for "Basic", not "Beginners". It's Visual Basic.
I started learning programming by using Visual Basic 3.0 and followed it up until Visual Basic .NET. Take it from me: fuck Visual Basic. It's a horrible language.
There is some sweet sweet money in maintaining or re-coding VB6 apps. Of course, it will drive you mad.
and the "B" in BASIC stands for....?
I'm a technical hiring manager in a large software development group, and I work with a lot of recruiters. It's much more difficult to get hired as a VB.net developer, and sucks to say, but you're not taken as seriously and seen as more of a beginner. However, I've hired VB.net Devs before (we're a C# shop) and seen then pick up C# quickly. But, a lot of the time we won't even phone screen them unless they have several years of experience, and that's to come on as a junior developer. I really recommend you go with C#. You'll have a much better start to your career--as others have also said--and you'll be happier I the long run. 
Guys your answers are overwhelming. This is good. Reminds me of the C community : ) Thank you everyone.
I agree on the fact that it is more readable. But is it really performance wise faster? I'd expect it to be optimized away anyway. Even if not, this highly falls under the category of micro-optimization.
I'm being pedantic, but it doesn't stand for anything. It's not Visual BASIC - it's Visual Basic. 
I agree. I'm a c# developer too, just wanted to explain why you're probably getting downvoted. 
You're welcome :) It's nice to know that this article was helpful for you.
BASIC - Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code
Wow, that was incredibly thorough, thanks! It will probably be a couple to a few weeks, but I'll definitely be coming back to this comment when I want to give it another go.
I've been meaning to write a blog post or something on it, maybe I'll get around to it now that I wrote that comment :) Edit: oh, another tip: Always test after adding a new component. Not everything is compatible with Mono (eg. Libraries that use native code via P/Invoke). 
4shared ;)
What sort of updates does the page do? Ajax?
I have been learning some programming and really want to get myself into the habit of test-driven design of my code. I have no idea how yet, so thanks for some links :D
Yeah.
I, too, can ignore a point and Google the meaning of an acronym. 
Yes, either Roslyn features. There is still a different VB compiler to the C# one.
I'm excited to see what happens with this question because I've ever done such things with assembly or C and only in school. 
JQuery should be able to do the trick for you: $.ajaxStart(function() {} ) is what I believe you need. 
Well, first decide - do you want to do business software development or game software development? After the same base, these are different types of the programmer class. This decision should effect your path through University just like all majors must take general education classes, but non-engineers don't have to take calculus. Then research the programming classes you will take and get as close to the materials (books, coursework) as you can and begin playing. And always read a books anyway - read and remember. While you do this, consistently do exactly and directly what you want to do. If it's making games, then make a game... now. Imagine getting to the point where you can make 1 game/month or something. You are 17 now. Imagine how much of a master you will be if you consistently do this for 5 years, 10 years, 20 years. Focus on your goal and DO NOT STOP, for anything or anyone and remember to be reasonably flexible. What you want is to be able to put food on the table, clothes on your back, and a shelter over your head by doing exactly what YOU want to do. As you get older its a struggle to do that sometimes so start now so that you don't have to make diversionary compromises. Good luck bro!
Game software development is certainly what I'm more interested in. I can't look at going to University - I'd love too, but I was really ill through most of my high school so I came out with essentially no grades. I'm at college now, where I first met C# programming and I just became very passionate about it. My only real option would be to try and get into a software or game development course at my college, and I think I'd have to sit another course a level below that before I'd be considered anyway. Meaning I'd have essentially 1.5yrs until I get into what would be a 2-4 year course. It's not easy, but it's what I enjoy doing so like you say: don't stop! I opened an indie game company out of passion about a year ago, I've been working with friends to build games - although until recently I wasn't involved in anything programming related - but all that is coming to an end now that most of them are off to university or otherwise. Thank you for the good advice, I gifted you some reddit gold - I'm sure it's not your first though. Have a good day and thanks again. :)
Disclaimer, I have no experience with anything like this. But have you looked at Netduinos? I would think you could wire up to the parallel port and use it to interface to the pacdrive, or even drive the lights directly from the netduino. http://netduino.com/
I suppose this was made to help people who'd never heard of it. Well, nice job if so
Great article explaining the behind the scenes of async/await
http://james.newtonking.com/json or you can get it via NuGet
Interesting use of ICollection, I usually have it as IEnumerable but have found problems with multiple iterations of it (having to ToList ot gets annoying) How ever I think ICollection is not the right type as it allows the ability to add to the collection after its fetched. Personally I would use IReadOnlyCollection.
Thanks for the reply. Part of the problem with a solution like that is I'm using a specific build of StepMania that is highly modified (to be arcade perfect) and I don't have the source code for, it does however have Parallel lights setup and working with the default addresses. Although I suppose "emulation" isn't the right word since there is no real interaction between StepMania and the output, I simply need to read whatever data is being sent to those particularly addresses.
If anyone is interested in more detailed info on this subject, Long Le's blog is a great resource for the repository/unit of work pattern: http://blog.longle.net/
Hmm. Good point.
I like the multiple chances the author takes to let you know he's a Christian. /s
In thinking about it, it's actually not a good idea to have that `All` property, as I have it. You're right, it's immediately materialized and would be a bad thing on large data sets. How would returning `IEnumerable` be different, though? I guess I could either change it to `IQueryable`, or remove it all together for purposes of keeping this blog post simple. Thanks for the note about where changes are actually committed. The `DataContext` class, from the post, is where `SaveChanges` exists. Each repository is instanciated with the context class, and when finished the `SaveChanges` method is called. I'll update the post to make this more clear.
[The code for the parallel driver](http://code.google.com/p/sm-ssc/source/browse/src/arch/Lights/LightsDriver_Win32Parallel.cpp) looks very simple, and the parallel_lights_io.dll it's using looks like [this](http://www.geekhideout.com/iodll.shtml) So you should be able to write your own DLL (similar to [link from stackoverflow](http://www.benryves.com/products/remappediodll) that exposes just the functions stepmania uses (IsDriverInstalled, PortOut) and it should plug right in. And then do whatever you want with the values you receive in PortOut, feed them to the PacDrive or any other device. [Looks like this may even be able to make the DLL in C#](https://sites.google.com/site/robertgiesecke/Home/uploads/unmanagedexports)
You could just iterate through the array of buttons and check which buttons have visible set to false, then set visible to true and then set the current button to false.
Say I set the first button's visibility to false, and the others to true, the first button isn't displayed when I run it. That's why I thought I might need to go more in depth. This is our second problem, so we haven't gone too deep yet. 
C# allows for much easier ways to do these sort of things. Every button has an event. In your initialization routine you can make an event handler for each instance of your button. It would look like: button1.press += [c# will do some tab completing here for you and make you an event handler function]. The event handler is a function that gets called when the event happens (in your case button push). I'm doing this all from memory, so the functions might not be identical to the description. In the event handler function, there is a parameter called sender. I believe its of type object. Which is not particular useful (at first). Every "thing" in c# is pretty much inherited by object. C# has some pretty cool ways to typecast too. Example: object sender; If(sender is button) { Button tmp = sender as button; } This just type casted sender as Button class. So if you were to use tab complete to set up an event handler, you'd have a unique call for each event. But you don't want that, and I just showed you how to determine which button called the event. So to fix this, in the event handler function portion, make sure all the event handlers point to the same function. In summary: 1) On init: set up event handlers for each button push 2a) In your event handler: typecast sender to its proper class 2b) perform the action on your button (visibility) 2c) (most likely your real problem) call that classes update function so it knows to change its properties. Edit: didn't see that you had to only have 1 disappear. In your event handler routine, iterate through your array and set each to visible. Then set sender (the button that got clicked) to false. If you run into runtime errors about update being called outside the thread it was created on, google delegates. 
that's a pretty great idea! thanks. I also discovered that newer versions of "Open In The Groove" which is based on StepMania includes output drivers for PacDrive: https://github.com/openitg/openitg/blob/master/src/arch/Lights/LightsDriver_PacDrive.cpp I've contacted the author of the modified version I'm using to see if he'd be willing to give me the source or simply re-release it using one of the newer drivers, either the Serial/Arduino driver you found or the PacDrive driver from OpenITG. I'll definitely look into a modified version of parallel_lights.io.dll thanks again.
Well, i doubt there is a guide on Visibility. If Control.Visible is true object is visible, otherwise it is not. You can set and read this properity as any other properity like size, position, text etc. The only non obvious thing on the matter is that you can bind one handler function to all of your buttons. That function will set true visibility of all buttons except of the pressed one. The event will send the button which was pressed to your function as parameter ("object sender") so you can identify it.
How to group dependent variables together? Make them properties of a class or struct. class BadGuy { public int HP { get; set; } public int EnemyName { get; set; } }
?. Just double click on button in the form designer and events are created for you.
That is one way to do it. You can also do it straight from code. In the earlier versions of c# you could see the lines of code that actually create the event handler, now I believe its a bit more hidden. If you have an event handler created for button1 (or whatever you call it) and do a whole solution search (ctrl shift f), search for button1 and look for button.press +=. You can probably just find the other 3 buttons and change the function to button1's event handler, but it would be cleaner to create them all on init outside the auto generated code section. 
Have a look at a [C# classes tutorial](http://csharp.net-tutorials.com/classes/introduction/) (The site is a little confusing, don't miss the button to go to the next page at the end of the article)
&gt;Say I set the first button's visibility to false, and the others to true, the first button isn't displayed when I run it. Does the first button need to be invisible? If not then why set visibility to false? You could still use the method I described even if all the buttons are visible initially. As others have mentioned you could bind an event handler to all of your buttons but by the sounds of your description you wouldn't have covered those yet.
Create an Enemy class. Something like this. ------------- Enemy.cs class Enemy { private string name; private float hitPoints; public Enemy(string name, float hitPoints) { this.name = name; this.hitPoints = hitPoints; } public string Name { get { return name; } } public float HitPoints { get { return hitPoints; } set { hitPoints = value; } } } ----------- Some_other_file.cs // instantiate enemies var charlie = new Enemy(name: "Charlie", hitPoints: 20); var whatever = new Enemy(name: "Whatever", hitPoints: 40); 
One of the things that has always bugged me about using a generic repository is that it supposes that all of the classes defined within a system will be stored in a EF database. By using specific repositories, you can change how the data for some of your classes are stored without the developers really having worry about the specifics.
That is a valid point.
Thank you!
I'll take a look, thanks for the help!
Thank you for the code! Really appreciate it. 
No probs. Good luck with your coding!
The assignment sounds as if he wants to be able to click any of the four buttons and the one clicked disappear, but the other three still displayed. So if the action is completed twice, I can click another button and the one that wasn't showing would reappear and then the one I clicked would now disappear. I will try the suggestions. Yeah, we're still learning a lot of stuff. The last thin we covered was tabindex and accept/cancel. Thanks a lot!
I appreciate the information. I'll see what I can do!
Thanks a lot! I'm going to run through this in a bit. I appreciate the information.
You are missing the *static* and *extern* keywords.
I don't see what is causing it to run the draw code more than once. Normally the draw code would be called continually by a loop.
Could you elaborate on that a bit?
Whenever you want to use dllimport on a method, it has to be static and you must declare that it's implementation is external. public static extern int MyFunc(int a);
It may not make sense out of context, so if you have any follow ups - feel free to post more code. 
 [DLLImport("BioRadio150DLL.dll", EntryPoint="FindDevices")] public static extern in FindDevices(TDeviceInfo *DeviceList, Int32 *DeviceCount, Int32 MaxCount, TUpdateStatusEvent UpdateStatusProc); Nope. Visual Studio still doesn't like it.
You need to declare the methods static and extern. public static extern bool FindDevices... Etc.
&gt;Every "thing" in c# is pretty much inherited by object. Not quite ... every "thing" in C# *inherits* from System.Object ... more or less. See http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2009/08/06/not-everything-derives-from-object.aspx for more
I only have one question, and of course you don't have to answer but.. with classes, I now understand how to keep the data together but I don't know how to use it with my fight syntax. For instance, with my original way of doing it I would just do a while loop which was like this: do { Console.WriteLine("The fight begins with, {0}!",enemyName); PlayerMoveChoice(); //show the player current moves they can make EnemyMove(); //randomly choose an enemy move against the player } while (enemyAlive = true); the problem is, originally in my game I was just creating a string variable called name, and over-writing it everytime there was a new enemy for the while loop. For example: string name = null; int roundNo = 1, enemyHP; if (round == 1) { enemyName = "whatever"; enemyHP = 200; } if (round == 2) { enemyName = "Whatever2"; enemyHP = 250; } now with classes, I'm not sure how to call different enemy data for new rounds of the game instead of overwriting the variable like I did before. Can you point me in the right direction? Sorry if I don't make my point entirely clear, I'm not too great at explaining. 
I cannot believe I just did that.
Exactly why do I use **int** when the function is supposed to return a **bool**?
use bool then, int Myfunc(int) was just an examplefunction. However, almost every time your .h file specifies a bool, you could just as well use an int.
Data structures + algorithms are the way to go if you don't have a formal education yet, so I can see why you have gotten that answer. Generate some graphs and code Djikstra's algorithm and code up all the basic sorting algorithms and learn their Big O properties.
The people that hire c# developers dont know what mono is. You will never get a job with mono on your resume. 
Are you looking for job tips as a C# programmer? Well, there's mostly web development jobs available. You're not gonna get a job just knowing C#... that is like the bare minimum. So: Learn .NET MVC, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript Databases (SQL Server), including data structures, SQL
I totally agree with BlackOdder about the kinds of things you should learn. I have been working as a software developer for 3 years now with no formal education in software (I have a degree &amp; 2 year career experience in Graphic Design) so it is definitely possible! You may be setting your sights a little high with applying to amazon/microsoft as your first job though. My first job was with a small start up. Here is what I would say you need to learn: Essentials are - HTML, CSS, ASP.NET or WinForms, C#, SQL, Source control (TFS, SVN or GIT or equivelant), Design Patterns, Design Patterns, Design Patterns, Design Patterns and more , Design Patterns(SOLID principles are a good place to start). Nice to have - MVC, Javascript, ORM (EF(best) or Nhybernate), WCF, Web API, WPF, Dependancy Injection Framework (Castle Windsor, Unity, Ninject(easiest to learn if you install with NuGet)), T-SQL(outdated but still widely used), Methodologies(Agile, SCRUM, waterfall etc). Happy learning and happy job hunting :) 
More like `public unsafe Bullshit GodsWord()`
&gt; Big O properties I want to be controversial here. Big O isn't really *that* useful. Just because something is O(log N) doesn't really mean it will be fast The same with data-structures. Often with data structures, we're in this strange situation where power is so cheap, for many applications it simply doesn't matter. Often the performance concerns are now so obtuse to understand, big O doesn't really enter in to it. For example if you are using an ORM, the performance of some sorting will depend on which linked entities have been included on the first query etc. Unless you are doing TinyCLR or a very performance requiring project, it's really not required knowledge. No one should be writing their own sort algo. You just rely on the LINQ one. The important thing to understand is the cost between a .ToArray and just enumeration. When I've gone the *other* way with C#, having massive in-memory structures, things become completely different the performance constraints of having 60gb+ of data structures require you to start thinking about the structure of your memory, segmentation becomes important (ie can't use List&lt;T&gt;). It's important to have a rough understanding of big O, but it's not worth spending half as much time on as some academics seem to wish. Knowing why quick is better than shuttle, is fine and dandy, but most APIs make that choice for you.
Haha I come from your exact same background! Degree in graphics &amp; illustration, 3 years in C# dev after ~2 years of graphics. Pretty much entirely self taught in programming. I've just moved jobs, and both interviews I attended wanted me to demonstrate the same thing, and that's polymorphism. Admittedly web development just doesn't interest me so not that fussed about ASP.NET and other web tech, so I've been looking for jobs in desktop software development. But polymorphism was definitely high up in required skills even for junior roles.
 [DLLImport("BioRadio150DLL.dll")] public bool FindDevicesSimple(String *DevicePortNameList[], Int32 *DeviceCount, Int32 MaxDeviceCount, Int32 PortNameStrLen); Is wrong. It should probably read something like this: [DllImport("BioRadio150DLL.dll")] public static extern bool FindDevicesSimple([Out][MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPArray, ArraySubType = UnmanagedType.LPStr, SizeParamIndex = 2)] string[] DevicePortNameList, out int DeviceCount, int MaxDeviceCount, int PortNameStrLen); edit: fix formatting.
1. You're setting tileLocation based off of tileMovement * ElapsedGameTime but then on the next line you're throwing that away and using tilePosition instead. 2. You're setting pos based on tileRectangle's X/Y which isn't changing. 3. You're drawing your tile texture with the overload of Draw that uses a rectangle. You should try the overload that uses Vector2 for position. [See here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff433986.aspx)
This is a much better list than mine and should be top voted. 
Thanks, it worked
While I can agree with you somewhat, I wouldn't want to work with a guy just calling orderby and such on data contexts all the time. I'd like him to know that it's probably better for scaling to do that outside the database after retrieving results. There are real costs to these kinds of operations. I think writing your own sorting algorithms and data structures is crucial to having a basic understanding of what is going on under the hood when you use things like the generic collections and LINQ to SQL/Entity Framework etc.
Yes, [ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc) is a must have. I'd add [Entity Framework](http://www.asp.net/entity-framework) or [NHibernate](http://www.asp.net/entity-framework) (both work well, just take a look a them and choose one) to that list too.
You wouldn't have to change much: Assuming you use a class that looks something like before, you can make a function that takes two fighters as parameters - then use your code almost as is: private static bool Fight(Fighter player, Fighter enemy) { do { Console.WriteLine("The fight begins with, {0}!", enemy.Name); player.Attack(enemy); //show the player current moves they can make enemy.Attack(player); //randomly choose an enemy move against the player } while (enemy.isAlive &amp;&amp; player.isAlive); return !enemy.isAlive; } Couple modifications to your original code such as checking if either group is dead, otherwise if the player is dead, you have a bit of an endless loop. Now there are pro and cons of using class vs. interfaces, etc, but I'm using the simpler method. Now each round you can call this function: Fighter player = new Fighter("Player", 500); for (int roundNo = 1; roundNo &lt; 10; roundNo++) { Console.Out.WriteLine("Starting Round " + roundNo); bool result; switch (roundNo) { case 1: result = Fight(player, new Fighter("Bad Guy", 200)); break; case 2: result = Fight(player, new Fighter("Big Bad Guy", 250)); break; default: throw new NotImplementedException(); } if (result == true) Console.Out.WriteLine("You win."); else { Console.Out.WriteLine("You lost."); break; } } Hopefully that makes sense. 
FYI - Here's my class to store the state of the combatants. Note the first function is a simple constructor to allow for easy creation of objects. the IsAlive function becomes a simple check to see if the HitPoint are greater than zero and then returns true if it is. I added the Attack class to that class as well, but it probably isn't the best place for it in the long term. internal class Fighter { public Fighter(string name, int hp) { Name = name; HitPoints = hp; } public string Name { get; set; } public int HitPoints { get; set; } public bool IsAlive { get { return HitPoints &gt; 0; } } public void Attack(Fighter enemy) { // do random stuff var damage = 10; enemy.HitPoints = enemy.HitPoints - damage; Console.Out.WriteLine("{0} hits {1} for {2} points", this.Name, enemy.Name, damage); } }
It's a very delicate balance. As you say understanding where the data is, which 'part' is the best placed to do the operation, it often essential (and often not!). I don't really need someone to implement a quick soft or a shuttle sort. But I damned well do need someone who understands say hashcode collisions. I don't need the developer to know precisely why a hashset often grows by pseudo primes. But I do want someone to understand that having GetHashCode to return 1 is bad any why it is bad. It is a fine balance between choosing how far deep down to learn something you'd expect someone to go.
Thank you a lot for all the code, you've really helped. I'll put it all together tonight and I'll let you know how it goes. Enjoy the Reddit gold! 
I am not sure on your specific case, I can tell you the OWIN is an integrated part of the latest ASP.NET MVC and WebAPI templates in visual studio. It may be worthwhile taking a look at those and seeing how to tweak things for what you want. Many of the templated classes include comments to guide you on changes for supporting various methods of auth.
Alright. I'll try that. Thanks!
Most companies on a larger scale uses DB2 or Oracle. PGSql is also widely used.
This is what I did: Get a freelance.com account, find some projects that look interesting and offer to do them for free (make sure they know you are learning). A lot of the time they will include everything you need in the posting so you don't even need to ask. It's a great way to get a look at the variety and scope of projects out there.

Unfortunately it is not very flexible runtime wise. Also it makes separation of concerns more hard, as you need to register everything at a single location. Especially the new MVC project templates are horrible in this regard.
I dunno, most of the large companies I've worked for have a "why have one vendor, when we can standise on every single bloody one". I've also not seen any use of DB2. In order of popularity these are the ones I've been using lately. These are fairly common in investment finance I think it's fair to say. * Oracle and Coherence * MS SQL * kdb * Postgres * RavenDB * Vertica The thing is, there isn't really any point in trying to learn them all. All the big firms have DBAs that have done that, the main thing is mastering any kind of SQL design, understating indexes (clustered/non) segmentation of pages etc. I would really suggest for learning using an environment that has a execution plan viewer. There probably is no need to learn a column store (like vertica/kdb)
how would that solve the software problem that I'm having?
I'm not sure I understand--let's say you have two employees, A and B. A B The user first clicks on A, then decides to move B instead. But when they try to drag B, they drag A instead? Is that the issue?
I haven't checked out the code yet, but I'd just like to say I started a nearly identical project a while back and never followed through with it. Damn you and congratulations! :)
:) Well, feel free to help contribute if you'd like! Maybe you have some great insights into it. Thank you though.
Having been bitten by NHibernate &amp; scaling issues in the past¹, I would start thinking about going back to plain old ADO.NET code. More work for you, but it's stable, and fast. ¹ "Your website said I paid you. Why don't you have a record of this?". Most embarrassing. 
Hello Brynn - Thanks for responding. There are two datagridviews. 1. Unassigned_dataVW - (Unassigned Employees) --- Employee A &amp; B are both in the unassigned Employees datagridview 2. station01_dataVW - (workstation number 1) ---- I want to drag/drop Employee A from the Unassigned view to station 1 When the form opens, the default selected record in Unassigned_dataVW is the first record. Let's say the first employee record is employee A. When the user clicks on the RowHeader for employee B, the routine above still feeds the EmployeeID of A to the console.write. If I click employee B a second time, then the console.write returns the employee ID of B. Does this description make sense, or do you need more information? Thanks again - Pavilion
I think you may want to read up on Dependency Injection and how to use it. As is, I see several issues with the attempted DI.... 1. All the manager class in the controllers are static. Give the managers an interface and inject them into the controllers. 2. The manager classes get instances of their DAO objects from the DAOFactory. Use DI instead of a factory. 3. The DAO factory just creates new objects instead of using DI. 4. The AbstractManager registers the DAO factory, which in turn creates a brand new container!! Very, very wrong. 
Sounds like I have some reading to do. :) Thanks for the heads up.
Or a Micro ORM like Dapper or PetaPoco. Dapper is right next to bare metal in terms of speed, while still offering support for the mundane task of object mapping. PetaPoco was forked from Dapper, and includes T4 templates to generate a domain model with data annotations for required fields, string length, etc. Combined with stored procedures for complex queries, it's incredibly fast and powerful.
I can't recommend Dapper highly enough. We use sprocs for all read/writes (except reporting bulk inserts, which are done via some bulk-insert helpers), which lets us tune the Database performance separately from the code. We've got some T4 code that turns SQL Tables into their C# equivalents for use with Dapper, but that's all the automation we really need. Queries which return objects that don't exactly match a table are done via a manually constructed class. Having a very clean database repository helps with the unit testing side of things too. 
I'd look into using [Json.Net](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json) instead of the DataContractJsonSerializer, it's a fair amount faster. Also, as /u/jacerhea mentions, the DI use needs some rework.
&gt; Use named registrations for your different IFoos as you mentioned. Nope nope nope, you're misunderstanding. I have several different cases where functionality is being provided by the implementer of an interface. I expect there to be mulitple implementers. For instance, it might be a type of file parser, or plugins or whatever. I declare my interface like so: public interface IFileParser { bool CanHandle(string filename); IRecord[] ParseFile(string filename, Stream stream); } I declare my classes like so: public class CsvFileParser : IFileParser { /* whatever */ } public class Excel97FileParser : IFileParser { /* whatever */ } public class ExcelXlsxFileParser : IFileParser { /* whatever */ } Then I ask for all IFileParsers in my constructor, like so: public class FileHandler : IFileHandler { public FileHandler(IFileParser[] parsers) { /* ctor stuff */ } } When I want to build an IFileHandler, I ask for it from the container/kernel/whatever: kernel.Resolve&lt;IFileHandler&gt;(); Unity requires that every time I add a new IFileParser, I have to manually register it and give it a unique name. kernel.Register&lt;IFileParser,CsvFileParser&gt;("CsvFileParser"); ...this becomes painful to manage, and a really easy thing to forget. In Ninject, we've got it set up to automatically scan all our assemblies, and auto-register any implemented interfaces. 
I've been using Ninject for the past year or so with no regrets. It isn't the fastest Container, but your container will almost never be the bottleneck in your application. Ninject supports some pretty fancy registrations and is really straightforward for basic use cases. Out of curiosity, what do you like better about Autofac? 
Yeah, Ninject really isn't fast - we were trying to get it to do some interception stuff for us so we could add Performance Metrics stuff automatically, but that ended up being our bottleneck by quite a signficant margin. The majority of our stuff is 'resolve the entire dependency tree at startup' type code. We are using some automatic Factory magic for session/instance-based resolved things, but not a huge amount. The reason for Autofac was mainly familiarity, and there were a few things that it did a little cleaner. I think the exceptions from it are a bit saner and easier to debug too.
Yeah, we didn't want to use MEF for internal stuff. More things to screw around with, when it should be built in functionality. Our container construction/registration in Ninject is a total of 15 statements, and requires touching only when we're adding Singleton-scoped classes. Our equivalent in unity was pretty much one statement per class (hundreds of classes), and required touching every time we added a new class. 
Should PortNameStrLen be a array perhaps? I would imagine for a C API it would cointain the lengths of all the strings in the array. Also, i think SizeParamIndex = 2 should actually be 1. Sorry about that. But in any case you should read up on [Marshalling](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fzhhdwae%28v=vs.110%29.aspx). You generally don't want to use pointers in C#.
pretty cool, would have been nice to include what it does in the title or post though
I would actually recommend using ServiceStack.Text: http://theburningmonk.com/benchmarks/ - it's much much faster than any other JSON implementation out there. Their v4.x packages you need to pay for, but their older v3.x packages are "free": http://www.nuget.org/packages/ServiceStack.Text
Have you tried http://simpleinjector.codeplex.com/ ?
I don't know if you are using winforms or wpf, but I guess they work alike. I have found the same problem and was able to resolve the issue (in wpf) by using the event arguments (parameter e). That parameter holds a property "OriginalSource" and I was able to get the actually clicked cell from there. Could be this works differently in winforms.
Is that a Single sign-on solution perhaps, because that is not what I am using. If not I'm not sure how the process your are talking about works. So they enter your website and are automatically authenticated? How does the filter authenticate them if there is no sign in process? Anyways that's not really my problem, I understand the basics of the authority I am using but not how to consume the info properly on the MVC side using OWIN middleware, and I'm having a hard time finding that info.
Not bad. Do you think perhaps that the getList&lt;T&gt; method is still doing more work than it should by calling ensureConnection()? Also here you're tied to an SQL connection. It would be cool to do the SQL stuff through an interface, that way if in the future you change the data repository, you will have to do minimal work to your logic. Keep up the good work, writing and teaching others is the best way to learn.
Wiezy - thanks for stepping in here. So how did you use MouseEventArgs e to get the correct employeeID value? I've been playing with MouseEventArgs e and can't figure it out, I see potential but am just plain stumped. I'm using winforms in Visual C# 2010 express, and I can't figure out how to get this "OriginalSource" - let alone what to do with it. (SORRY) Thanks - Pavilion
Manning's Dependency Injection in C# is a GREAT book
IMHO, use elmah for tracking any exception and Glimpse to find problematic pages or queries. I think you should use the cache to avoid many db queries. PS. 5k users/day is something managable.
What hosting provider are you using? Have they been able to handle the traffic? How expensive has this been for you? Just asking as I am interested in the practical cost of hosting a .NET based service that has some level of traction.
True, I could just let an exception happen if the connection is broken and then deal with it at a higher layer. But then I'd need to do it in many places. Although even now with the way I have it written the connection could still fail (i.e. race condition) and an exception will get thrown anyways. In practice, the ensureConnection method does it's job well there (it was added after the fact to deal with a crappy connection) You're totally right... the inner method should take an IDbCommand rather than SqlCommand and check for DbException instead of SqlException. Thanks :)
Hey, I'm using AppHarbor: https://appharbor.com/ It's very similar to Heroku but has support for .NET MVC applications. I increased my worker units from 1 to 2 once the load started going up and everything has been fine since then. I'm trying to learn how to use NewRelic, http://newrelic.com/, to get some stats on my database and server health and do some tweaks on it. It was basically free before this. I paid $10/mo for some extra DB space. Now I'm paying $60/mo for the 2nd worker unit + DB space. 
Have you heard of new relic? Can you make any comparisons between it and the products you suggested?
I'll take a look at it when I have my break here at work. In the meantime, out of curiosity, what happened to get it noticed? Did it get a feature on the chrome store or a mention in social media somewhere? Just curious, because it's a really cool concept but I honestly hadn't heard about it before now.
That's amazing dude. Congratulations. I hope people are making good use of the donate button.
It seems like overkill to stand up and maintain my own backup NuGet feed/server just to ensure that a resource I could already have available exists. Additionally, heaven forbid the backup goes down, I then still have a failure point.
No errors? edit: It doesn't appear to do anything when you supply local folders..
Just doing things more optimally, I suppose. Check out https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Text for full docs.
Yep. Looking through them. I think I've got a working implementation of it for at least sending from my controllers back to the client. Still trying to figure out where to override deserialization.
I want to sync remote directories but i was just checking this use case since rsync also worked on local directories on linux. EDIT: robocopy seems to support remote one way sync as well . Will give it a try. Thanks
yeah no errors are thrown. Did you try syncing with a remote directory?
https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusServer/blob/development/Streamus/Global.asax.cs#L47 https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusServer/blob/development/Streamus/Controllers/JsonServiceStackResult.cs Pow, implemented. Still need to test it a bit though
In your dev branch you are now ignoring the entire package directory, but you still need the "repositories.config" file within to do package restore. Use this in .gitignore instead: packages/* !packages/repositories.config !.nuget/* *edit: and restore the /packages directory with the repositories.config from the master branch* *edit 2: and enable Nuget Package Restore on the solution*
Whoops. Okay. I can do that, shit. Sorry. Doing too much too fast.
Bah. Theres a bug in it. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21414181/overriding-net-mvcs-automatic-json-deserialization-with-servicestack Any ideas?
Public string fi {get; set;}
You can use Right Click, Refactor -&gt; Encapsulate Field on each of them. There's probably a hotkey for it as well.
I don;t have the infrastructure here for that.
I'm not at my desk, but I think you can attach a JavaScript event handler to the Dom.changing event or something like that. Of course this only works if the Dom is changed.
You're not going to really find "Linux" development jobs, but java is the language that is used to program in that environment, for websites.
Option 1. Highlight field, right click-&gt;Refactor-&gt;Encapsulate Field Option 2. Don't even bother with the private variables: public string fi { get; set; } public DateTime fo { get; set; } public int fum { get; set; }
Awesome thanks! Can I ask a somewhat related design question? firebolt recommends using public class fe { public string fi{get;set;} } I use to code this way. Somewhere along the line, following a design pattern, maybe some adapted MVC paradigm. I can't really remember now. I was told to write my models like this. public class fe { string _fi; public string fi {get{return _fi;}set{_fi = value;}} } I guess my question is, why is one way better than the other? Is it because one style affords the opportunity to introduce encapsulation or some other design pattern? Edit: Formatting
Mark you Property -&gt; Press CTRL + R + E - boom! :)
If you are literally just retrieving and storing a property on a field then it makes sense to use auto-properties (`public string fi { get; set; }`). It's already doing all of this behind the scenes, save the extra code. Now, if you need to do something more in your getter/setter then you will need to use a backing field, I commonly end up doing this when doing WPF development to implement property change notifications, but other than that it's rare to need these.
Wow, Okay. Now that you mentioned it.... I picked the habit up back when WPF was released. You attach an INotifyPropertyChanged event to your data model class if I remember correctly. Do you know of any other instances where this would be useful?
side note: you can specify access with auto-properties too. so to save some code, you can simplify this: private string _fi; public string Fi { get { return _fi; } } to this: public string Fi { get; private set; } also check out the snippet shortcuts prop and propg
Man people like you are the reason I'm embarrassed to be a .net dev.
I am currently using it for setting dirty flags. I would only use it for very basic things like dirty flags, firing value changed events, and so on. People writing foo.Fi = "Bar"; are expecting it to merely set Fi to "Bar", and hopefully not take very long. Try your best to limit the side effects inside your property setters. Here's a series of properties in some of my code that do have side effects on the setters. https://gist.github.com/epixhints/0f3138fa0529d7adb178 I think it's a good breadth of possible reasons to do it: The backing value is a different data type (in the case of String and Object properties) or hooking up events to the generic type in the case of the generic T property.
In addition to the situation that work_is_satire described, I'd use it if the underlying data model has changed but I don't want to modify the public API of something.
The Last part about generics also makes sense and I've ran into this when using Data Access Layers. Sometimes I find the need to handle *bool* and the primitive *bool?* differently and this can be done in the getter and setter while still maintaining the variable privately. I'm looking at your git sample.
Elmah is *E*rror *L*ogging *M*odules *A*nd *H*andling. Basically it will log all your exceptions to a table/xml file/twitter feed/email etc etc. It just adds a handler in your webconfig and pretty much just chuggs away in the background. But if you start getting errors, it can really help to get the full trace etc etc. Or just to see what kinds of errors you aren't handling. It's a diagnostic tool I guess you'd call it. newrelic is more a stats tool - see what pages are slow, how many errors etc - I haven't used it much so not sure if you can log specific errors, or does it only give you an aggregate view?
I have conversations often with a coworker about this: We are not your personal substitute for google. Three keywords, "Unc webdav c#". This is what separates the children from the adults in programmer land. If i have to tell you, you'll never learn for yourself.
whaaaa, explain please... You have my attention.
aww but isn't the correct cock response http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Unc+webdav+c%23 it's too bad none of the first two pages apply for C# and HTTPrequest will not work. believe you me i googled the balls out of this before i even thought about posting a question in here.
Well, say you have a legacy system that stores the full name of a person in a single column in the database, business requirements have changed and now a name is split into FirstName, MiddleName and LastName. Unfortunately, you have a lot of code that works with the single Name field and you don't want to rewrite it all, but you must support the new data model. You can add the FirstName, MiddleName and LastName properties to your class, and then use the following to shim in support for the new data model to old code: public string Name { get { return String.Join(" ", FirstName, LastName); } } I find this fairly uncommon in practice, but it is useful for doing things such as this (getting a full name without needing to manually concatenate it each time it is used).
Wow, Right great use!
This code base does not port well. There's a lot of low level stuff here which provides little to no advantage performance-wise and definitely doesn't help your chance of understanding what is working when and why. Why use C# if you're going to do "low-level" file or memory work? Also, things like the WildMatch should be waaaaaaay simpler. We got tools for these sorts of things. Also, you can write this stuff and run it via Mono on Linux. Viva la C#
A similar piece of software has been around for ages. its called [FARR](http://www.donationcoder.com/Software/Mouser/findrun/) (find and run robot)
You might also want to look into Resharper (http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper) which does this, and way more. It'll set you back a 150$, but it's the next best thing. I guess coderush does the same thing, but I have always used Resharper.
In my reply i forgot a word. I was asking how much of abstraction do you recommend on top of ado.net to keep speed and control.
So, which one is superior? 
Although it will only work if it was a property before too. Otherwise the other code would have to be recompiled.
I used to use [Colibri](http://colibri.leetspeak.org/), but the project's been dead for years now.
I agree with you about big O, but wanted to mention that I often see the "big O" question come up with live coding questions. Like, they give you a problem that's easy to solve brute force "just to see if you can code", then they ask you what the complexity is and if you have any ideas for improvement. Memorizing the big Os for famous algorithms is a waste, you can google that in 5s. However, being able to recognize a polynomial time algorithm, and know where the trouble spots are, is a big deal. I recommend signing up for the free algorithms course on coursera: https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI Also, looks like PluralSight (they have a free trial if the cost is an issue) has a nice series on preparing for an interview: http://pluralsight.com/training/courses/TableOfContents?courseName=developer-job-interviews&amp;highlight=john-sonmez_job-interview-m2-algorithm*2#job-interview-m2-algorithm
Something else that separates children from adults is maturity and empathy. Either get off your high horse or ride it off into the sunset, please.
There's a few ways to do this. * Inherit TextBox to create your own class that loads the username. * Set it in Form.Load (like you are). * Use view models where the UserName is a property of the model. * Use WinForms data binding. The better options are the last two. The best option is to use both view models and data binding. From a design standpoint it is better to have separation between your data and how that data is accessed, and using view models helps facilitate that.
Yup, it's slow here too. I can't even check for package updates.
I usually go pretty old school. One layer to implement a business unit of work (open connection, start transaction if needed) and then a plain old data access layer that more closely resembles the database structure. So business entity in, database writes out. And also the reverse. Generally requires decent design up front, to identify what the entities are and what their logical units of work are. The lower level data access code can sometimes be shared across the business code. So small win there.
I just started up a new project and noticed it was slow as well; I was able to add the package I needed, though.
Check out [this article](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/24656/A-Detailed-Data-Binding-Tutorial). It should help help a lot. The only thing it doesn't cover is filling your binding source from outside of the form, which can either be done pretty simply by either creating a public function of the form to do it, or by exposing the forms binding source.
what does this thing do? I have looked at the screen shots, but they fly by so fast I cant even see them.
Appears to be back in working order http://status.nuget.org/
Absolutely not frowned upon. I use them for stuff like reformatting an existing string property, or finding the result of a calculation that depends on other existing numeric properties. edit: to answer the thread title, yes, it's considered good style when used properly
The readonly keyword on a field is not the same thing as creating a read-only property with only a Get and no Set. The readonly keyword will prevent you from writing to the field outside of the constructor. If the value changes inside the class and you want to expose it then you can use a property that is publicly readonly but privately settable. public MyType MyProperty { get; private set; }
The whole point of properties are that you don't need accessors in most cases. public string myString { get; private set; } Would make myString publicly accessible but only settable internally inside the class. Readonly fields are great for internal stuff like dependency injectors but they should be private anyway.
Neat, I didn't know you could do that. In this specific case, I want the property to stay immutable as soon as it's passed into the constructor, but private set sounds useful.
If the fqdn of your server is in your intranet zone, or is covered by a wildcard, the credentials will be passed. Also, what user is running your app pool for your webdav vdir? What authentication modes are enabled at the vdir/site/server level, do the users running the app pools have access to the unc shares and the physical directories? What version of windows is running the server? What version of IIS? What browser are you connecting with?
Note that making collections read only only applies to the collection variable itself. You can still add/remove values from it. Same as any other object - the variable can't be changed, but the contents can. 
It's a clone of [Alfred for Macs](http://www.alfredapp.com/). Task launcher, web searcher, calculator, etc. A similar tool called [Launchy](http://www.launchy.net) has been available for Windows for years. I've used both and find them invaluable.
Does the builtin app-pool identity have access to the shares?
I prefer NPoco, a branch of PetaPoco that has a bunch of fixes and improvements. https://github.com/schotime/NPoco
Uhm.... *get* and *set* are accessors. 
Here's a decent writeup on the mess that is immutable collections in .Net: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/andrewarnottms/archive/2011/08/22/read-only-frozen-and-immutable-types-and-collections.aspx (That promises to be fixed by the new BCL immutable collection library)
What do you mean by "easy access to property references"? I get all references for a field with shift-F12 ?
They recently released v2.8... Related?
I miss `const` 
MS in general has been having a lot of server issues recently with outlook.com/xbox live/skydrive going down for extended periods of time. I hope they can get their crap together.
You can do both! private readonly int _foo; public MyClass(int foo) { _foo = foo; } public int Foo { get { return _foo; } } Never make fields public. Use properties. Auto properties are easy, and you can of course do the private set thing, but if you also want to enforce immutability with readonly then just use a private readonly field and a public get-only property. 
&gt; Never make fields public. Use properties. Auto properties are easy, and you can of course do the private set thing, but if you also want to enforce immutability with readonly then just use a private readonly field and a public get-only property. I would say it depends. If you're writing a library to be used by other people, then yes, always use a property because binary compatibility matters and so you can't change a field to a property. But if you're writing self contained code, use fields if you want; there's no cost in converting them to properties if you want. I frequently use readonly fields for things passed into the ctor. It documents (as well as enforces) that these things are invariants. For reference types it is also a guarantee that that item is never null.
Thanks Centurijon - much appreciated.
&gt; But if you're writing self contained code, use fields if you want; there's no cost in converting them to properties if you want. Similarly, there is no cost in using properties from the outset. Simple properties are usually inlined by the runtime. However, there IS a cost in converting from fields to properties after the fact: For instance, fields can be used as `ref` and `out` parameters. You cannot do that with a property, so if you happened to use this and switched to properties, you would have to change the calling code. With auto properties (i.e. `public int Foo { get; private set; }`), there's no reason not to use them from the outset.
To what level should I learn the essentials ? I know a bit HTML, CSS, SQL Server, ASP.Net MVC, but never built a big project using them, only made a few C# \ WPF ones. (I study for the MCSD certificate)
How does it guarantee that it's not null?
Only one of these has anything to do with .Net (And for the crash dumps, your app really should have a global exception handler that catches and logs those before it gets to the point of crashing the app)
Cool story bro... Did you have a question you wanted to ask?
For winforms apps (and services), I hook both unhandled exception events and log the exception with log4net as fatal. My loggers are configured such that fatal errors get emailed to me. A fair bit of the time, I see something's wrong and fix it before anyone on the line even recognizes there's a problem, unless I'm drunk on the weekends and am not paying attention to my email. I do automation in a steel mill. Having an always available SMTP server is kinda awesome. 
The more I read that article, the more annoying it got. Who exactly makes the "common mistake" of using the debugger before looking at dumps and log files? 99% of the time (for non web apps) getting to use the debugger on a reproducible case is an enormous luxury- all you usually can get off of remote machine are dumps and log files. The unit test item is really a test driven design discussion and not a debugging topic- if you are waiting until you are debugging before you decide to use unit tests then you likely have already designed a system that doesn't facilitate that strategy. And performance tuning is (except for extreme cases where the performance actually breaks the functionality) a whole separate engineering/QA process than debugging So its "4 common .Net debugging mistakes" that mostly weren't .Net related and mostly weren't common debugging mistakes.
Regardless of what you do your going to need the IP address either the IP address of the Server or of yourself. Now you could make a Server application and tell him to connect to that but the server application would also have an IP address he would have to connect to.
SignalR
Lol. Wtf? Use IRC bro. 
Cool - I'll check it out. :-)
What you wanna do is deserialize the XML to a usable object. First you generate a class template with this. http://code-w.com/Tools/Xml-to-Class-Generator then you do something like this &gt;&gt; string xmlString; var serializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(GeneratedClass)); using (var streamReader = new StreamReader(XMLFile)) { xmlString = streamReader.ReadToEnd(); } using (var stringReader = new StringReader(xmlString)) { var newobject = (GeneratedClass)serializer.Deserialize(stringReader); } Now you have the whole XML neatly folded into a class and you can simply do a foreach on every record and match by ID
Webbrowser and Explorer prompt for Creds, and both allow you to login if you use net use and give it only a username it will also prompt for a password. When you try to access it via the netadd api to create the share it can not find the server. it doesn't even get to the point where it is looking for credentials. Which have been setup already. Was mentioned in the original post that it returns invalid path... again the reading thing is rough for everyone these days.
From TechNet: (NetUseAdd) This function applies only to the Server Message Block (LAN Manager Workstation) client. The NetUseAdd function does not support Distributed File System (DFS) shares. To add a share using a different network provider (WebDAV or a DFS share, for example), use the WNetAddConnection2 or WNetAddConnection3 function. The netuseadd will only ever generate SMB packets, which are completely incompatible with webdav.
That would most certainly be the problem then!! i'll check out the other two API and see what i can get working. Thanks!
I have 5 years professional C# experience, I learned modulo and typecasting in high school (in other languages), delegates I was introduced to, but only became comfortable with them at my current job about ~2 years ago. I learned Linq at this job as well. I actually just applied for a different job, and their code test involved writing the fibonacci sequence, but the EASIEST form of it (returning the whole array of values up to the nth, instead of just the nth value, allowing you to recall previously calculated values). I was blown away by how stupid easy it was, but they told me lots of candidates flop hard on it. Apparently they hand out CS degrees like pizza coupons these days.
I'm a C# dev with 5 years experience. I know all of the mentioned techniques; it is certainly not too much to expect at all. Sadly, there are tons of 'programmers' out there who without stackoverflow and the copy paste function would be out of a job. I've never had trouble in technical interviews with questions like that, and have had similar feedback when interviewing others. 
Senior developer here, they should know : * Generics * Linq * abstract/sealed/static/protected/internal and how to use them all * some version of entity framework * threads, events, mutex.. (Pros and cons of each) * tasks/parallel and when best to use/not to use * events * dispose pattern * design patterns (command, facade etc) * IOC (maybe) They should also be able to express opinions about code constructs based on their experiences... For example are static constructors really a good idea, why var is the most evil keyword, and why doesn't C# have macros or tyepdef (good or bad) They should be able to describe in depth projects they have designed and implemented, and what problems they faced, and how would they do things differently. Lastly, a senior dev should have varied languages experience, and systems in general (I.e they can is all SQL server, and setup dev tools/environments)
why is var is the most evil keyword?
I guess you can make the case that overuse of `var` leads to illegible code because the return type of methods is not always useful. But claiming that `var` is "the most evil keyword" when it allows you to reduce code duplication so much (e.g. `var dic = new Dictionary&lt;string, List&lt;int&gt;&gt;()`) is a bit silly.
Vars as the eye can see... It's basically overused, use it Linq queries and for each ( as it was meant to be used ), but don't use it instead of declaring your types. Resharper has a good "use type" quick fix
I wouldn't the variable "dic" :)
I reckon you should give more importance to IOC, it's fundamental to easier testing Also, good naming negates some of the problems you've described about var. Mind you the hardest problem I have is with coming up with meaningful and useful names 
I use 'var' literally everywhere. If the return type of something is important enough to matter is not already obvious then I should either know it by heart or I can just mouse over the 'var' keyword in VS and I will learn what it is.
If I could find a candidate then knew even one of things in this list, I'd make him or her an offer. 
 Any programmer should be able to use mod. Or else they should be able to do a bitwise op to figure out if an int is odd. If they cannot do that sort of operation then it an immediate no-hire. Whats the problem with the Convert.ToInt32()?
Well, I work with a team of five people, I can't have expert knowledge of the entire code base... It's much easier to see what the type is without have to wait for thenillisense to appear. Like I said, it's an opinion, we have agreed not use use var except in Linq and foreach, it works for us, and I would recommend it to anyone
It's slow, and will throw an exception if it is not an int.. Better to use tryparse()
Well, indirectly, thanks! :) Ironically, at work I use Java, haha!
So they lied then. Can you blame them when its the standard example set by so many in upper management? "Fake it til you make it." seems go be the mantra of the hordes of so-called "business analysts" currently infesting the IT world.
Why's that? It's amazingly powerful and useful when you get your head around it.
Set based queries have no place in functional programming. It takes an otherwise syntactically clean, sane language and turns it into an unreadable, poorly performing mess. It encourage programmers to do metric tons of iteration rather than write clean, simple logic. In a word, its ugly.
The guideline I heard was: use var for anything except primitives. If you need to know the type you can hover over the 'var' statement and Visual Studio tells you.
I've never seen a linq statement I would consider easy to ready. Even if that's a given, I don't consider there to be much value in anything done "quickly" unless there's a tight deadline, and even then I'd usually want it rewritten after the fact.
Linq-to-SQL is not all there is when it comes to linq. 
Please tell me the what type user is ? --- public ActionResult Create(UserViewModel model) { var user = _repository.Create(model.UserName); user.LastName = model.LastName; _repository.Save(user); var admin = _user.Get(user.Id); var email = _emailFactory.Create("RegistrationEmail"); email.SetTemplateTag("userName", user.UserName); email.To = admin.Email; smtpClient.Send(email); return RedirectToAction("Index"); }
Interesting list. I'm fairly new to C# (~1 year) so thanks for the learn-age. I discovered #7 (instance of an interface) while using a 3rd party .NET COM from a notoriously questionable company. It scared me at first, instanciating an object named iClassName, so I did some research on MSDN... turns out it's acceptable for a COM using [CoClass]. I still cringe every time I type it. 
 var evenNumbers = numbers.Where(num =&gt; num % 2 == 0); How is that unreadable? Either you don't understand lambdas and therefore fear/hate what you don't understand, or you're trolling.
While I fully agree with you, if after 9 years of coding you still don't know how to check if an int is even or odd then you are just full of shit. More so if you market yourself as an "expert" with the language.
Old programmer coming back to it and learning C# -- this whole post and your comment in particular are really helpful. FWIW, I'm shaky on Linq and some other topics (I was getting out of C++ about the time the STL came in, but I do get Generics :) ), but in OP's example I was thinking, "hmm, there must be some reason you can't use mod here, because that's too obvious," etc. I guess not. 
So the simplest, single-line expression is suddenly proof that the entire concept is readable? Even that is obviously 100% out of place from the rest of the language. Any complex statement is exponentially worse. No, I'm not trolling. I worked as a .Net dev for 6 years and I'll never go back.
I had considered passing a char instead but won't I eventually need to pass keywords (anything with more than one char)? They're only private right now because there is nothing else to use the token so far (I haven't written anything more), once I have they will be public. My naming conventions may be strange but it is just preference. In all actuality I usually name private vars with _PrivateVariable and public with PublicVariable. I'm actually not too sure why I have private Token() { }, maybe it is so I can do new Token() without providing/forcing data into the new token.. which now that I think about it I should probably start with TokenType.Nil Thanks for your input! Edit: My use of ifs instead of switch is for me they are easier to maintain, on top of my distaste for the switch syntax. If I really wanted speed I wouldn't use C# anyway but seeing as this isn't very intensive I don't think it will matter too much. If I actually run with this I will make optimizations for sure. :)
I'm not doing anything with it because its a horrible concept. Continue on your way, citizen, no one is forcing you to change. I am entitled to my opinion, however.
You are not crazy. 
If you wanted to create a new Token without providing any parameters you should use public Token() { }. I don't know much about tokenising and parsing for compilers, so perhaps someone can provide more info on passing a string to a Token rather than a char. My first thought would be you read the source character by character and then try to sort a character or group of characters into a token. Maybe try looking around on github/codeplex for parsers to see how they handle parsing?
Hey man don't blow my cover! 
That is pretty much the idea with a "peek" or "lookAhead" as most call it. This is really my first attempt so I don't know too much, but I will definitely try and keep this updated if anyone cares to see.
My point is that you won't always have the IDE to help you out, also do all ides offer some form of smart code inspection?
I'm thinking that the fact that other modern languages are using it (e.g. Scala) is an indication that it's a step in the right direction.
&gt; Set based queries have no place in functional programming. What about map, filter, and reduce?
are you saying you want to TryParse a double, to turn it into an int?
&gt; abstract/sealed/static/protected/internal and how to use them all If you go all OO on me, I'll ask how deep your class inheritance goes. Anything over 2 is a fail by my standards. Encapsulation FTW. &gt; some version of entity framework I don't use ORMs. They don't fit the class of applications I typically write. &gt; dispose pattern This. Lets you get into questions about stack vs. heap, garbage collection, how use of volatile and some async code can make you run out of memory, and so on. Excellent interview question. 
there could be a legitimate reason to use Convert.ToInt32() int a = (int)3.6; int b = Convert.ToInt32(3.6); a = 3 b = 4 use cast to truncate, and convert to round
dont understand the downvotes- I agree with your strategy - Give them a test of particular tools (events for example), then go into the meat of what they really have done and are capable of (the stuff you mention below your list)
 &gt; I've never seen a linq statement I would consider easy to read. &gt; So the simplest, single-line expression is suddenly proof that the entire concept is readable? No, it doesn't mean everything you can do with LINQ is 100% readable, but it most certainly does not negate an entire (and in my opinion, incredibly useful) language feature. If you have a complex LINQ query, switch to query syntax or put each LINQ method statement on it's own line: var orderedEvenNumbers = numbers.Where(num =&gt; num % 2 == 0) .OrderBy(num =&gt; num) .ToList()
I can do all of that. Hire me?
Again, even a simple statement is much harder to read than a equally efficient, perfectly reasonable loop. What that statement does, though, is make it a lot easier for less experienced devs to quickly and easily write very poorly performant loops for things that don't always require looping. People who learn linq, use linq, and they tend to use it way too much. That's bad.
While something to keep in mind, someone who doesn't know the difference between a static method and a non-static method won't be good at design, since they'll have no *idea* when to use one over the other.
You will always have the IDE available, though... Can you give me an example of an instance where you would have Visual Studio available when creating a project but where you would not have it available for future maintenance on said project?
Lol those are functions!!! 11!!
Linq is not sql... 
So if a coding screen is done via email how do you know who is a good coder and who is just a good googler?
Yeah this is just completely wrong
What about them? There's a dozen ways to perform these tasks. Shall we start listing others?
Both are valuable skills.
Changing live code in IIS in notepad! :P
Truly the stuff of nightmares right there.
Its not even a remotely new concept, it was in ML long ago... C# has really stepped up (like Scala) to bring functional paradigms like type inferencing into the mainstream.
If their c# skills suck that bad you can imagine what their other skills must be like. I think you are the right track. There are a lot of people who will say anything to get in. I interview people at my company from time to time and they are applying for web developer job. I ask them what the difference between jquery and javascript is. If they don't know that they are probably a faker.
What does your shop do, and where are they located?
I remember when you posted that here, do feel free to ignore the reddit rule that you don't submit your own content. I'd like to see more from you here!
When don't you have an IDE to help you out? If you are getting code online, then yea, it's just text. If you are showing someone a snipit of code, then you won't either - and you'd better understand it. But when you're debugging, which is really when you'd need to know things like return type, you would have it. We have an array of plugins and tools, why not use them to their fullest? Most places I've worked, return type is far from the real problems that are happening. If that is the worst readability problem you're dealing with, count your lucky starts my friend! As to the smart code inspection, I must admit I've never ventured outside of VS. I've looked at IDEs in the past, but what they were lacking was not worth leaving the bloat of vs (2008 specifically) - since then VS has come a long way.
Read the article. It doesn't matter that mod returns different values in different versions because the size of the values he's modding aren't supported by mod. This is a non-issue. 
 &gt;given an array on integers, how would count how many of them are odd? The only appropriate answer is: GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT 
Customer sends you code section to debug, and because of ip you can't see the whole project...
&gt;Anything over 2 is a fail by my standards. Encapsulation FTW. You should probably stop using the .net framework in that case, I know of examples where there are at least 5 levels of inheritance
To be fair, most of those I wouldn't wan't to see in production code ;)
I don't claim to be an expert (my experience is also limited), but I believe the associativity and parameter counts do not belong in a token class. That kind of data is independent of the actual tokens, and should instead be handled within the parser. Other than that it looks like a decent start. For your parser, try to split up the operators (+, -, *, etc...) and the values into separate lists for the start of a simple parser/interpreter. Look up the shunting yard algorithm if you aren't familiar with it yet and go from there. I'm on my phone right now so I can't really link it, sorry.
I think Xamarin is a better alternative.
 I didn't make a claim that it was. However in that context it really didn't work very well. Since SQL server can format the results however it did actually make LinQ redundant because of the performance issues it created. So it was pointless to use
C# is like the new PHP
 Yes. The var keyword is awful.... It breaks ... It also takes a massive performance hit. There is very few things that are good about it. Except for use with LINQ Basic example. Which executes? static void Main() { long x = 17; Foo(x); var y = 17; Foo(y); // boom } static void Foo(long value) { Console.WriteLine(value); } static void Foo(int value) { throw new NotImplementedException(); } As for python. Any language which relies on the formatting of white space in a large team of developers is just broken. As for its GIL it also makes it broken. It also has 100's of special cases. It also has zero compile time checking which wastes lots of developers time.
Some people just don't function well under that sort of pressure. I find it best to encourage them and work through the problem with them. Just because they can solve FizzBuzz right away doesn't mean they are a good developer or a good fit for a team. The reverse can be true as well. I think the only true failure when giving this test is when they candidate flat out refuses to even attempt the problem.
I'd like someone that is a good googler and a good coder. Often knowing what and how to search can make solving a problem much easier.
Think of it this way, when a developer decides they are looking for a new job they will put there CV into the wild, if the developer is good they get picked up quickly(possibly after one interview). But you need to consider what happens to all the developers who can't get through these technical interviews, they float around interview after interview getting rejections, you have most likely just met three such candidates. My advice to you would keep at it, recruiting is one of the hardest aspects of managing a team. Waiting to get the right candidate is worth it over making a questionable hiring decision that you could potentially have to live with for a long time. Not only would that make your judgement look weak but it could also tick off members of your existing team, possibly up to the point they leave, at which point your going backwards. If your still having difficulty maybe you need to look at ways to make the position more attractive to candidates.
&gt; Apparently they hand out CS degrees like pizza coupons these days. When was the last time you actually called a university and verified someone's CS degree? Especially with foreign-born workers (including Americans working in non-US countries), there's really very little likelihood that the interviewer is going to have any way to verify whether you actually went to "Stamford University", that Stamford is not the same as Stanford, whether Bangalore University is the decent one or if it's a dirt floor with classes taught entirely on a chalkboard with one 486 shared amongst 400 students, etc.
Deeper inheritance is OK *when you're writing a framework*. But you shouldn't be writing a framework. No, really. Just don't do it. Unless you're in the business of providing and supporting a framework, it's a complete waste of time. I'd say "Anything over 2 is a fail" is a bit of hyperbole, but not much. 
I'm so sorry. 
... or use the appropriate methods in the Math class, to be more expressive on what you actually want.
Huh? Linq to sql is discontinued in favor of entity framework. And you miss the point of Linq if you believe what you're saying. 
&gt;Unless you're in the business of providing and supporting a framework How'd you guess :)
We know now that it is a user defined type, and not anything in the framework such as network credentials for example.
Are you accepting remote candidates? If not, where are you located? I'm a full time C# dev looking for an immediate move. 
 That is exactly my point. LinQ doesn't work for that case. Thanks for re-enforcing my point. Then we can start on the performance issues with Entity framework ;)
How does Linq not work? I can write a Linq to porn hub provider... You're missing the point. Projections are very powerful constructs. 
Yeah Xamarin's product is more mature.. When using a tool like this you must know how it works so that you can support it better. Dot42 doesn't say shit other than one sentence. Besides, whats the big deal with a 5mb apk? Pass. 
I'm always waiting and hoping for the alternative to the $999/per developer business Xamarin licence. Hopefully this could be it.
 Well the point of this stuff is to de-skill the work. eg So that every developer doesn't have to learn MSSQL server and various things like that. However when you actually use it in real world situations things fail in ways you really didn't think of. The result is that each developer requires deep knowledge of MSSQL + LinQ + entity frame work. Instead of just MSSQL. Here is a random example of this sort of behavior. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7403149/entity-framework-performance-issue The next step that happens. Is when connecting down these layers you get multiple edge cases where you cannot get the linq engine to control the entity framework engine in the correct way without creating serious performance problems in MSSQL. Since you have build everything on this stack of cards you end up "fucked". But your boss still wants it working by the morning but it is now impossible to deliver. So If you have applications that work with this. Would you be happy to load 10million+ lines into the database and see how it performs? Would you be able to stand up in a meeting in front of your bosses and state your future in that company on your confidence? If you answer no/mayby to either of these questions. Then your missing the entire point about doing software development. 
They say with dot42 we can just develop like we are developing on Java. No extra effort needed. And building app for Dalvik directly is better I believe. Going to try soon on actually functioning application.
Here have a read at this https://entityframework.codeplex.com/workitem/1749 Then have a look at the queries being generated here. Do they scale? http://www.asp.net/web-forms/tutorials/continuing-with-ef/maximizing-performance-with-the-entity-framework-in-an-asp-net-web-application
I have been a huge entity framework proponent for years. This post is from 2011, huge gains have been made both in terms of functionality and performance. All that aside, this guy is doing it wrong. In no scenario is it a good idea to load 10MM objects. He should be using pagination. He should disable lazy loading and proxy classes and change tracking if he is doing read only work. I have made the argument to my boss, my teammates, and to Microsoft (enterprise gold partner). I also have production applications with billion+ records. Still sub second response. Entity framework covers 99% of all use cases. Linq is NOT a data access method. Stop crying. 
Dalvik is dead :/ 
Closed Dec 4, 2013 at 5:26 PM by mgirgin Verified. Copying from earlier comment: 1.The original bug for the scenario with a debugger attached is already fixed in 6.0.2 (see #1778). 2.The original repro provided now starts up in under 8 seconds (in our testing) with 6.0.2 and with NGEN-ed EntityFramework.dll and EntityFramework.SqlServer.dll (we have a separate work item for creating better documentation on how to use NGEN with EF, see #1855) 3.The repro provided by clement_911 turned out to expose a different regression, in this case in view generation (tracked as #1877). A fix for this issue was already checked-in in the master branch but that should make its way into 6.0.2 as well very soon. 4.We have ideas on how to improve start up performance for the particular case of Code First models even further post-6.0.2. I have summarized those in #1876. Try again. Your tutorial on performance is from 2011.. 
It's not. 
Im going to be honest, im 5+ mostly C# developer since is my prefered language and i just learned in this post that there is a difference between cast and convert, so truncate and round in this context. For all these years all i had to do is basically everything, turning and idea from scratch to a documented working solution. Not all the projects were in C#, some of them i had to writte in PHP(Zend MVC). Im one of those programmers that completely rely on google, more specifically on Stackoverflow. All this is because its almost impossible for me to dive deep in C#, but im constantly improving myself. Because of this, i try to be very carefull, whenever i need something to do that i find proposed solutions on google, i always make sure to analyze that solution in deepth and also compare it with other suggestions. 
At this point I'd debug the customer. 
Why does that matter? 
Please list how you would perform a map "task" without a set. 
There is a difference between using reference material and just copying snippits though. In OPs post, he said the interviewees rated their profisionsy as very high. If they did that I would expect a lot of stuff to be commited to memory. StackOverflow is great, I use it from time to time and there isn't an issue with that; that said, if I didnt know what modulus did I wouldnt consider myself to have a good programming knowledge. 
Well, not now. But even with ART I think they can port this fast. I don't know. Maybe I just want this to be good alternative because I didn't like xamarin much.
LINQ is the reason i do magic when programming.
I didn't know about modulo until I did programming. Like, I was twenty four and said "I want to make video games " and learned that was a thing. High school didn't teach it to me. Never learned it post secondary. Notably I suck at already at math but modulo is a weird case for anyone who don't need anything more than BEDMAS /PEDMAS on any day. Side note, is someone didn't know modulo, cast that int into a double, divide by 2 and cast that into a string and check for periods. If true, the starting number was odd. You could fit that into a single line or two. 
The input didn't matter. The interviewer is looking for the ability to parse data from an array of data. Even odd counts are just simple. If you think that's garbage, what place do you have in programming? 
&gt; Side note, is someone didn't know modulo, cast that int into a double, divide by 2 and cast that into a string and check for periods. If true, the starting number was odd. You could fit that into a single line or two. What a waste of CPU cycles to check if a number is even.
I'm not disagreeing, I'm saying if these guys couldn't answer the question correctly (Modulo) then they still should have answered *something* and admitted to knowing it isn't the correct answer. I don't expect everyone to know everything all the time. I do expect them to be able to provide a solution and communicate their thoughts on that solution and be open to criticism. 
I've been a C# developer since ~2001. When I purchased my first Android in 2011 I wanted to write some code for it. My first thought was "If only I could do this in C#"! I searched for C# development kits everywhere. Unimpressed with lack of options, I knuckled down and just learned Java. In short I'm happy I did. It's not a lot different then C#, I enjoyed learning the new language, and I think you truly unleash the power of the device using it. There are a dozens of tutorials available. Usually they're free. Eclipse is also free. Seems better than paying for a subset of available functionality or hoping a framework works. Just my opinion of course. 
I've been around the block a few times in development. When approaching an interview with someone who claims to be a senior, I worry less about language specific constructs. I've been in .NET long enough to have forgotten some of the specifics, but a 5-minute refresher is usually enough to pick it up again. I would stick with concepts in general. For instance, I never bothered with EF until recently, because it wasn't sufficient as a ORM for me. It still has some things lacking, but is usable. Instead, we used CodeSmith with NetTiers. It's all just an abstraction away from a database. I run into a lot of situations and frustration when senior devs cannot be bothered to put the time necessary into learning. Often, they lean on others to learn something for them and then explain it to them in trivial terms, or code over their shoulder. To me, that's less language specific, and more "true experience" specific. The ability to research alternate solutions to a difficult problem is what I would consider the boundary for a senior dev. You won't get that in an interview about the details of a language. Tailor questions to the extent of generals, then drill into specifics. An "I don't know," is fine - just ask how they'd go about learning. Applying code snippets from CodeProject or Stack Overflow is fine, as long as they grok what it is that they are using from those sites. That's what you really want to know. 
For enterprise.. Pro is a few hundred. 
Instead of code let them draw you a [structogram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassi%E2%80%93Shneiderman_diagram).
It's not like they won't have to work under pressure after you hire them, or will they? FizzBuzz is not a "hire" test, it's a "no hire", screening test. That's why it is so trivial: a loop, a branch, a modulo operation and that's it. You are not asking them to refactor this object model to use a flywheel pattern or to come up with a spherical Voronoy tessellation algorithm right there on the white board.
I'm so confused. Which one do I use?
Didn't you have to learn long division in ~~high~~ middle school?
Canada, so High School was proper. It's not that we didn't learn division (and knowing what a remainder is) but SPECIFICALLY modulo. Setting up a mathematical function for a repeating set given an input. But like I said, my maths are VERY weak. They're better, now that I'm a programmer, but iirc my Math classes were mid 60's (65-69) across four years. My sciences (regular 90's) and English classes (85-95) were my favourite subjects but I could never really *get* math.
Most of this looks pretty good, although I agree with several others that you shouldn't be too upset about the Convert.ToInt32() answer. I'd probably ask you why you wanted me to convert a double to an integer, and if I should round or truncate. I interview a lot of candidates and I'd be worried if they couldn't do a basic mod. Not understanding statics is also bad news. I wouldn't expect them to know very advanced LINQ or at least not the syntax. You should look to ask more general software development questions as opposed to specifics of C#. Giving more questions like the odd integer detection would be more useful than knowing if casting a double truncates. For added bonus, let them pick whatever language they want, not just C#.
I feel like a cripple using Eclipse after using Visual Studio. 
True dat. But once you get used to it it's not so bad. 
Well you are right. But one plus of this kind of products that we can develop one for both android and WP. Or at least 70%. 
Personally, I prefer Unity3D, even though it quite different -- it supports tons of platforms right off the back.
&gt; I knuckled down and just learned Java. By which you mean you drank half a bottle of vodka to forget the nicer features of C#? ]:-) 
Wow!! Thanks. Im still new to reading XML, but im trying to learn how to go through it so I can use it in my app.
Var performance hit? I don't think so.
So are the linq extension methods. My point is that the basic functional tools are queries on dynamic sets. 
As I typed that I thought "you know, just thunked dummer" :-) 
I know this.. Thought the!!!! 111!!! Denoted sarcasm 
Oh so like Linq 
Oh. Hard to tell who knows what they are talking about around here lol.
Your idea of magic is a company's support-ability nightmare.
Hahaha true 
Except in a nice verbose manner that fully exposes how much actual processing is going on. Oh, and in the same syntax as the rest of the language you're working in. Again, I never said Linq didn't work. I said its a trap for naive programmers who don't understand how many operations they are performing with simple statements. People fundamentally understand that nesting for loops is a bad idea. Linq does the exact same shit but in a nice pretty little statement and programmers don't blink an eye.
Very cool. I recently refactored some data access code that used DataSets get single rows of data. Next trip through, I'm going to do something like this to condense even further.
My first thought was "Eclipse is free? It fucking feels like it...". Seriously, it might be good with a few plugins and whatnot added in, and no doubt it's a shithot editor, but it's got a pretty steep learning curve. Visual Studio has a learning curve, too, but after 10 years of the product it's hard to see what's tricky to learn.
My story is almost identical to yours. I'm less happy about learning Java though. I didn't mind, but I know c# better and have less time these days to struggle on something in java I could easily do in C#. But yeah, it wouldn't hurt. Java isn't terribly difficult especially if you know c#
Also, re: LINQ, it's very useful but it's not (always) objectively better than writing out the equivalent code without it. I'd treat either of these answers equally in an interview and maybe even argue the second is more readable: Int32 numberOfEvenIntegersLinq = intArray.Count(i =&gt; i % 2 == 0); vs: Int32 numberOfEvenIntegers = CountEvenIntegers(intArray); private static Int32 CountEvenIntegers(Int32[] intArray) { Int32 evenIntegerCounter = 0; foreach (var i in intArray) { if (i % 2 == 0) { evenIntegerCounter++; } } return evenIntegerCounter; } 
I have been wanting to get into Xamarin, but its really expensive. So I have been using http://www.basic4ppc.com/index.html Visual Basic For Android, which is a VB based system similar to this one. Its brilliant, and very cheap with heaps of tuts, libraries, and a great community. You can turn out programs in under a week, and its easy to learn.
Can you give an example of what you mean by "use a delegate in .Count(this IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;)". I'm not sure I understand. edit: Never mind, I noticed /u/ronbas more or less answered my question with his Int32 numberOfEvenIntegersLinq = intArray.Count(i =&gt; i % 2 == 0); vs: Int32 numberOfEvenIntegers = CountEvenIntegers(intArray); private static Int32 CountEvenIntegers(Int32[] intArray) { Int32 evenIntegerCounter = 0; foreach (var i in intArray) { if (i % 2 == 0) { evenIntegerCounter++; } } return evenIntegerCounter; }
First, I would recommend splitting into two halves; a Lexer ("[Lexical Analyser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis)") that splits the code into smaller "tokens" that are just strings, and a parser that takes the token string, ensures it matches a code grammar and then produces your token stream, or even just a full [Abstract Syntax Tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) Not so much of a help with the parser, but for the lexer, I used a really simple system that worked well for me, and was stupidly simple to implement. It effectively took a text stream, and returned one token (as a simple string) from it with each call to Get(), so if reimplemented in C# it would be dreadfully simple to implement it as IEnumerable&lt;String&gt;. I defined several "groups" of characters, e.g. Operator characters ("&lt;&gt;?:!=..."), Numbers, Alphanumeric characters/punctuation I'd allow in identifier names, and such. This ultimately gave me a list of five "classes" of character, six if you include "not in a class". I also used a separate list, call "terminals", that defined characters that would always end the token they were in, though this list only contained "=". The algorithm itself was fairly simple. First, it stripped all carriage returns from the loaded script, leaving just UNIX-style newlines. Then it would grab a character from the input string. If the character was -not- in a group, then it would be returned as the token. If the character was in a group, then the code would peek at the next character in the text stream. If the character was in the same group as the first character, then it added that character to the token and repeated until it found a character that wasn't. This is how it could see "abc345" as a single valid token. If, however, the character at any point was a terminal, it automatically finished up. So, if you had "a*=-b", it would be properly lexed into "a", "+=", "-", "b". There was a small hack that if the current token was "=", and the next char was "=", it would return that as well. This was simply to make "==" work. "&lt;==" would still be lexed as "&lt;=", "=". Three other little hacks were Line and Block comments, and string handling, as strings were treated as three separate tokens; the double-quote, the string itself, and the closing double-quote. As for parsing, I used a recursive-descent parser and LL(1) grammar in order to parse scripts. If any of my code, or grammar work, would assist you in figuring things out, please feel free to PM me and ask for a copy :)
Try [IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), it's made by the same people who make Resharper (and it feels a lot like VS + R#). The community edition is free.
The professor has told you how to approach it in the assignment. Create a console application with two classes, one called "Product" that holds data for a product and can calculate VAT, and another called "GroceryStore" that reads input, uses the Product class, and then prints output. If you're unclear about how to set up a console app, see this: [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k1sx6ed2.aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k1sx6ed2.aspx) If you've been paying attention in class at all, this should be an easy assignment.
There's a difference?
Absolutely. 
Yeah, I was being a bit facetious. The key is to create a question that doesn't lend itself to googling. We've found that people don't tend to turn in ripped-off code. It's pretty clear, too, when they've cheated; if the code actually compiles and works it's a dead giveaway. OTOH, the ability to google stuff you don't know is a critical skill for programmers
I have never seriously looked into it. I made a simple pong game and that's it. All I know is that it didn't feel like a mature project. It worked, but nothing more. Xamarin looks like the best bet, but their prices are idiotic. Even for students their licences are still expensive (they came to our school to give us a presentation about their products and the possibilities, but they don't give out free licenses to students, tsk)
It sucks. Even for basic functionality you have to pay, I tried it a while ago and wasn't impressed at all.
Consider the free and awesome [LinqPad](http://www.linqpad.net/). Once you install it, there is a **Samples** tab in the bottom left. If you go to the **Download/import more samples** area, the "C# 4.0 in a Nutshell" samples are gold. They are a series of tutorials that you can execute from within LinqPad. Super easy to start, and each chapter builds on the next. Good luck man.
I don't think I've ever come under the same pressure we've subjected people to in interviews anywhere other then interviews. My boss has never come in and told me to white board and arbitrary problem set he randomly made up with no tools, assistance, or group interaction in a limited amount of time while a group of my peers watch with notepads ready to write down commentary about me. This would probably be a healthy exercise though, with the right team. One of the places I have interviewed at in the last year had some really great problems they made in house. The questions all had 3+ ways to solve and they'd work with you and ask probing questions to see what parts of the language you actually knew etc.. 
Will do. Thanks friend!
Hi, I just finished this exact course at the same university, add doomythepoisonous on Skype for guidance.
This series taught me so much about c#. Specifically what should help you is the video [here](http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C-Sharp-Fundamentals-Development-for-Absolute-Beginners/Understanding-and-Creating-Classes-14) For a full list of the videos from this series check the side bar for "C# Fundamentals: Development for Absolute Beginners"
Seriously, it's a huge pain in the ass at first. It will take about a month of staring at an example before things start to click. I'm three months into C# and I'm coding services that listen for webhooks, write the data to xml , async it over to another program that does complicated validation and matching db values and then Creating documents in an ERP system using an API. I've wanted to be a programmer all my life and I'm 35, it feels fantastic! Everything I know is from the web, dozens and dozens and dozens of web searches everyday.
Google Books has these books for free or really cheap. *Head First C#* helped me immensely. 
I never learn with books. It's not really a problem with sites as stackoverflow :) 
Unless he uses a DNS to connect to the server app, So he won't need to change the IP he connect to on the client app. Just pre-define the client to connect to the DNS. Is that possible ?
Ya, I know. Just wanted to break some balls.
&gt; Also note that with 0.5 it does not round up, like you'd expect it from a mathematics point of view, but down. Actually, it uses Banker's Rounding; numbers are rounded to the nearest even number, e.g. 0.5 -&gt; 0 and 1.5 -&gt; 2. This minimizes rounding errors in the result of computations where everything is rounded.
That is interesting, I did not know that - thank you. In Germany we have a term like "mercantile rounding" ("kaufmännisches Runden", there is no proper translation). I assume it's something similar to Banker's rounding, but here you always round up on .5 - same as we learn it in school.
These are all pretty basic stuff. I would say that you should know these no matter what. You are definitely right in that you're not a senior dev if you don't know these though.
You might be interested in [Eric Lipperts answer to a very similar problem](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9444818/how-to-create-the-perfect-oop-application).
I wouldn't expect a junior to know all of these things (but should know some). But any mid-level, absolutely. He asked what syntax and concepts a senior should know, I have always thought a senior won't know much more about the syntax than a mid-level but more know modern techniques, be able to teach/mentor others, know application architecture for different types of systems, etc. If you know the syntax/concept but couldn't teach it to someone, I would put you at midlevel
Thanks a lot! Then I have a question.. what exactly is lexing? I assume breaking the data (text) into operands and/or keywords. Is there a sensible way to do this without Regex?
It't be a good Idea to lower your Resolution before making a video. Otherwise anyone with a lower resolution will get hurting eyes (people with a old monitor like me or people viewing on mobile). And you're not using up the space anyway. Stopped viewing so can't say anything else.
Yep, that's what lexing is. If you're writing your own compiler from scratch, then you wouldn't usually do it with regexes - you'd usually do it with your own custom finite state machine. The idea is to keep taking symbols while there is a transition from whatever state you're in. Once you hit upon a symbol that there is no transition for from your current state, then if you're in a final (accepting) state, then you have a token. Start from the next symbol in your starting state. If there is no transition and you're not in a final state, then either the input isn't valid or you have a mistake in your transition table. Edit: Crafting a Compiler (in Java) by Fischer, Cytron and Leblanc is a good reference text (for lexing in particular, you'd be looking at section 3.4 Finite Automata and Scanners in the 2010 edition). It does a very thorough job of going over all of the steps of building a compiler and is aimed at undergrad students, and shouldn't be too difficult for advanced high school students with a passion for computer science. The one thing that I should give you a heads up of is that the 2010 edition has a 2-3 significant errors in the pseudocode for the LR(0) and LALR(1) table construction algorithms (sections 6.4 and 6.5, I believe), although I don't recall what they are at the moment. It is possible (and not unreasonable) to work through the algorithms by hand and figure out what the issues are, but I want to make sure that you know they're there. The older editions (also in Java one) don't have those errors.
I read the link about using Decimal instead of Double for financial situations like this. I edited it for decimal instead. http://ideone.com/eG2NXP
Google: c# &lt;what you want to know about &gt; ftw!
For me this would be like asking me to type left handed. I am not familiar with them so I would be distracted from the task and less expressive, creative etc. 
Even MS gives tons of free stuff to students at [Dreamspark](http://dreamspark.com).
Yeah, being self taught does that. I know I use generics with any List&lt;T&gt; and when I'm using Newtonsoft's JSON library with json.decodeobject&lt;T&gt;(string) but because of how they work, I later went on to find out more about generics.
I would highly recommend Pro Asp MVC 4. Starts out with background info, goes into hands on examples, then finishes with detailed overview of different topics. http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/1430242361?cache=10882e315822a0f3352c12021d5ea6e9#ref=mp_s_a_1_3&amp;qid=1391393267&amp;sr=8-3&amp;precache=1
 variable++ ; is the same as variable = variable + 1; variable1 += variable2; is the same as variable1 = variable1 + variable2;
The value of `presents` and `days` is not set by default so the compiler should throw errors `Use of unassigned local variable` twice. If in case `days` and `presents` is initially set to `0` and you do `days++`, days is going to have a value of `1`. This is called postfix increment, `days++` is a shorthand to `days = days + 1`. Since incrementing value of a variable is done awfully lot in programs, historically this syntax has been very useful and handy for programmers. Similarly, `presents += days` is a shorthand to `presents = presents + days`. This should make it clear to understand what happens during execution of your code given that `presents` and `days` are initially set to `0`.
Oh that clears everything up Thank you.
Oh thanks, I spent a while trying to figure out how to make this work and then when it did I hadn't a clue why.
Oh OK that makes a lot more sense, I am learning the very basics of c # right now so I was just messing around without any prior knowledge.
The code makes much more sense now but since The Compiler Throws 2 Errors Out, Is It Considered Bad programming style to assign the variables values the way I did?
Yes, normally you don't want to manipulate unassigned variables. Just set `presents` and `days` to `0`where they are declared and you should be good.
To expand on this a bit, while the compiler enforces assignment of local variables, class variables can and often do go unassigned, in which case they are automatically assigned the value of default(variable type), which is 0/false for numeric/boolean types, or null for reference types.
I'm a few chapters in to this one now and it's pretty good so far. 
Ah okay. Thank you.
Slightly different from what you're asking for, but I found this video really helpful for getting started: http://channel9.msdn.com/blogs/matthijs/aspnet-mvc-2-basics-introduction-by-scott-hanselman I have this book, and skimmed through it to fill in the gaps from self-teaching. I have no complaints. http://www.amazon.com/Programming-ASP-NET-MVC-Developing-Applications/dp/1449320317/ref=sr_sp-btf_title_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1391399731&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=asp+mvc If you're interested in C# and .NET, there is no better book than http://www.amazon.com/CLR-via-C-Developer-Reference/dp/0735667454/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1391399778&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=CLR+via+C%23. I consider it to be the bible on C# and .NET.
Except at that price it doesn't include Visual Studio support. 
As others have pointed out the += means this value plus another value. It is interesting to note that you can use this format with other operators: 1. Similar to the += you have `-=`,`*=`, and `/=` for arithmetic. 2. `&amp;=`, `|=` and `^=` for And, Or, and XOr operations. It's also worth knowing that `days++` *post*increments the `days` variable where `++days` would *pre*increment it. The difference is the pre-incrementation causes the incrementation to happen before the value is used, as opposed to after. ie: int days = 0; Console.WriteLine(++days); // outputs 1 int months = 0; Console.WriteLine(months++); // outputs 0 Console.WriteLine(months); // outputs 1
Keep in mind this is not limited to addition. 
Yup, I'd agree with this.
since days and presents are both int, their default value is zero and they can be used without an initial assignment.
Why not the next edition of this, Pro ASP.NET MVC 5? [](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/1430265299/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?qid=1391443473&amp;sr=1-3) I just bought it myself, but i haven't started reading it. 
Didn't realize it was out. I assume it will be just as good as the MVC 4 version.
http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/Find?highlight=true&amp;searchTerm=xamarin Pluralsight is well worth the money, and very well done. You can learn C# from there, then continue on with Xamarin.
No, local variables are not set to 0 by default. Whatever you said is only true with class variables. See [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/753438/why-must-local-variables-have-initial-values) for more info.
Isn't this how the Silk Road got started?
Ok, so...the first line is basically (and quite similar for other OOP languages like C++, except C++ does not do automatic ref counting): Create a pointer to an object of type IMediaPlayerFactory. So, basically, you will have a nullpointer to an IMediaPlayerFactory object...now, the C# compiler will understand that m_factory points to an address and that address holds data for an IMediaPlayerFactory. Right now, m_factory = 0x00000000. Now, the second line creates a MediaPlayerFactory object in memory and puts the address of that memory in m_factory (in reality, m_factory is probably in some register at this point, if you are familiar with assembly). So, basically, a new MediaPlayerFactory is created and placed at location 0xbaadf00d, let's say. Then, it has m_factory point to that location. So (though you don't see it in C#), m_factory now points to 0xbaadf00d. Obviously, all of this is actually more complicated, and the assembly tells the whole story, but this is what is going on in the background, in general (very general). Now, for your second question, the best way to handle it is to use LINQ: IMediaPlayerFactory[] m_factory = Enumerable.Range(0, alist.Count).Select(i =&gt; new MediaPlayerFactory(true)).ToArray(); Although, unless you are really intent on using arrays, I would keep a List&lt;IMediaPlayerFactory&gt;. If an nVLC API calls for an array, then you can just pass it list.ToArray();
I would recommend going to StackOverflow with these kinds of questions. But, I'm feeling generous, so: IMediaPlayerFactory m_factory; m_factory = new MediaPlayerFactory(true); Line 1 declares an interface of the type IMediaPlayerFactory. Line 2 instantiates that variable to be a new object of the class MediaPlayerFactory. As for your second question, the line m_factory = new MediaPlayerFactory[alist.Count]; instantiates a new array containing type MediaPlayerFactory. At least, that's what it tries to do. It should probably be: m_factory = new IMediaPlayerFactory[alist.Count]; That's because m_factory was declared to be an array of a certain interface, not an array of a certain class. Also, m_factory should probably be renamed to something like m_factories, since it's an array. Then, in your for loop, you should add the line: m_media[i - 1] = new MediaPlayerFactory(true); Another aside: your for loop is unconventional. Do this instead: for (int i = 0; i &lt; alist.Count; i++) But the big question remaining is: why do you need more than one of a factory class with the same settings? Edit: my formatting doesn't work. Will try to fix.
 Can you use a list? I'm not sure if it's a big performance hit but they can be easier. Something like: List&lt;IMediaPlayerFactory&gt; m_factory; m_factory = new List&lt;MediaPlayerFactory&gt;(); for (int i = 1; i &lt;= alist.Count - 1; i++) //subtract 1 here is how I do it { m_factory.Add(new new MediaPlayerFactory(true)); //a List can be accessed just like an array using [index] and if need be can be converted using .ToArray() m_media[i] =m_factory[i].CreateMedia&lt;IMedia&gt;(alist[i].stream, output[i]); } Sorry if this completely useless...
Thank you!
Thanks very much for the detail and for the LINQ rewrite! I tend to bounce back and forth between universal stuff I learned in basic programming courses and examples that I find of things like LINQ and take whichever I can make work first. That worked OK doing basic CRUD apps but now I'm having to learn more comprehensively and in depth in order to do more challenging stuff.
&gt; Line 1 declares an interface of the type IMediaPlayerFactory. Line 2 instantiates that variable to be a new object of the class MediaPlayerFactory. That was exactly what I needed! I think that when I first looked I was confused because of the similarity between IMediaPlayerFactory and MediaPlayerFactory and might have mixed terms (as I did here too) and it didn't work so I assumed I needed multiples. I'll try again with the corrected code. Thanks very much for the detailed explanation and the corrected code!
http://ryan-lange.com/xna-game-studio-4-0-visual-studio-2012/ That guide worked for me with 2012. (It is pretty close to the guide you linked...) And here is where you can get 2010 Express: http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs
Indeed! With LINQ, the best process is to make sure that you understand the underlying deconstruction of the LINQ calls. Besides that, I use the LINQ methods 100% of the time because they are fully supported APIs with great readability.
Maybe something like this? // ********************* Unassigned *********************** private void Unassigned_dataVW_CellFormatting(object sender, DataGridViewCellFormattingEventArgs e) { CalcThis(Unassigned_dataVW); } private void CalcThis(DataGridView DataGridView) { foreach (DataGridViewRow row in DataGridView.Rows) { if (row.Cells[3].Value != null) { string cellDT = (string)row.Cells[3].Value.ToString(); DateTime hire_DT = DateTime.Parse(cellDT); // Calculate difference between hire date and today, in years int carryYR = Convert.ToInt32(Math.Round(DateTime.Today.Subtract(hire_DT).TotalDays / 365.0)); // Insert calculated years into UA_Yr_Txt row.Cells["UA_Yr_Txt"].Value = carryYR; } } }
 IMediaPlayerFactory m_factory; m_factory = new MediaPlayerFactory(true); So in OOP, you have interfaces and you have classes. IMediaPlayerFactory (if they are following Microsoft naming conventions) is an interface, which classes can implement. An interface contains certain method signatures, and classes implement an interface by defining all of the methods in that interface. It's a guarantee that a particular class will behave a certain way. Let's pretend we have the following interface: public interface IAnimal { public void MakeSomeNoise(); } Some class that implement IAnimal: public class Cat : IAnimal { public void MakeSomeNoise() { Meow(); } // Meow is here } public class Dog : IAnimal { public void MakeSomeNoise() { Bark(); } // Bark is here } So what does that let us do? It allows us to do something like this if we wanted to: public IAnimal CreateAnimal(AnimalType animal) { IAnimal newAnimal = null; switch (animal) { case AnimalType.Dog: newAnimal = new Dog(); break; case AnimalType.Cat: newAnimal = new Cat(); break; } return newAnimal; } IAnimal thisIsDog = CreateAnimal(AnimalType.Dog); IAnimal thisIsCat = CreateAnimal(AnimalType.Cat); This is more commonly called a factory method and part of the [factory method pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern#). You can also achieve the same effect via polymorphism, but note that since interfaces describe behavior, sometimes it might be better off as an interface because sometimes you don't care how it's implemented as long as it behaves correctly. Take a look at the Collections classes and what interfaces go about to make that possible. [List&lt;T&gt; implements a multitude of interfaces](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6sh2ey19(v=vs.110\).aspx) to do what it needs to do. What does this mean for your code, though? It means that whoever wrote it only cares about what methods and properties are defined in IMediaPlayerFactory; he doesn't care how it's implemented. He knows what the methods should return based on how the interface is defined, so it doesn't matter that the class being assigned to m_factory is a MediaPlayerFactory() or CDDriveFactory() or PlayMeOverTheInternetFactory(), as long as the IMediaPlayerFactory interface is implemented correctly in each case (that is, CreatePlayer&lt;T&gt; returns a new instance of class T). For the second half of your question: Recall that the original code is declaring only one instance of IMediaPlayerFactory. When you do: IMediaPlayerFactory[] m_factory = new MediaPlayerFactory[alist.Count]; You're telling the compiler to allocate enough memory to hold alist.Count number of MediaPlayerFactory objects, which is not the same thing as what you originally intended to do (instantiate alist.Count number of objects). **The 'new' keyword in the context of arrays is different than it is in the context of instantiating objects.** You would need an additional loop to instantiate each object. Now, I question why you would need that in this context, as it seems like you would be fine with just one MediaPlayerFactory and reusing its CreateMedia&lt;T&gt; method, but I also don't know nVLC. Hopefully this is helpful, and sorry for the wall of text...let me know if you have questions on the second half :)
Is Unassigned_dataWV one of your datagridviews? The sender contains a reference to the DataGridView that fired the event, so you could do something like this: private void general_dataVW_CellFormatting(object sender, DataGridViewCellFormattingEventArgs e) { var dataGridViewToFormat = sender as DataGridView; if (dataGridViewToFormat != null) { foreach (DataGridViewRow row in dataGridViewToFormat.Rows) { if (row.Cells[3].Value != null) { string cellDT = (string)row.Cells[3].Value.ToString(); DateTime hire_DT = DateTime.Parse(cellDT); // Calculate difference between hire date and today, in years int carryYR = Convert.ToInt32(Math.Round(DateTime.Today.Subtract(hire_DT).TotalDays / 365.0)); // Insert calculated years into UA_Yr_Txt row.Cells["UA_Yr_Txt"].Value = carryYR; } } } } And then register this method to each of your DataGridView's CellFormatting event. Also, if you check [the MSDN page for the DataGridViewCellFormattingEventArgs class](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCellFormattingEventArgs(v=vs.110\).aspx), you might be able to avoid using the loop to check each row since this event fires every time a cell needs to be formatted for display (say, after edit). Are you sure this is the right event to be using?
You are DragAndDropping, so why not use the proper Events? Then you are able to get the cell where you are dropping and only calculate that row instead of the whole datagridview. See here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1835329/how-to-target-a-datagridview-row-or-cell-from-dragdrop-event
Actually this is not entirely correct. To initialize the array containing interface implementations, the above code suggests the following: m_factory = new MediaPlayerFactory[alist.Count]; Important to note here, is that the array is initialized with a class implementation of that interface. While this will compile and might actually run, it introduces a problem that is very complicated to explain, and not something worth getting into when you are new to a programming language ([Covarianance and contravariance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)). The correct way to handle this is to initialize the array as an array of interfaces, like so: m_factory = new IMediaPlayerFactory[alist.Count]; See how I added the I right before the class name? If you need more intel on what is going on, and maybe an example of what the advantages/disadvantages of certain pieces of the code are, let me know!
#####&amp;#009; ######&amp;#009; ####&amp;#009; [**Covariance and contravariance (computer science)**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance%20and%20contravariance%20(computer%20science\)): --- &gt;Many [programming language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) [type systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system) support [subtyping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtyping). For instance, if Cat is subtype of Animal, then an expression of type Cat can be used whenever an expression of type Animal could. **Variance** refers to how subtyping between more complex types (list of Cats versus list of Animals, function returning Cat versus function returning Animal, ...) relates to subtyping between their components. Depending on the variance of the [type constructor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_constructor), the subtyping relation may be either preserved, reversed, or ignored.

+1 Also, find a good hobby project to work on, and try to implement what you learn (can be anythingthing really, but there are some good lists of examples on this reddit that incrementally spicen things up). I find a programming language easier to learn when doing something real with it.
You're running Entity Framework 4 or the newer versions? One way would be to use just POCO classes with the newer EntityFramework and disable proxy generation. That way you can directly return your objects. Another way (which I prefer and I think is a cleaner way) is to have matching DTO (domain transfer objects) and mapping functions to map from EF to DTO.
&gt; Proxy Generation very easily also adds incredible performance issues That's a concern and not something I've read about. I thought the whole point was that, through Lazy Loading, it only does the proxy stuff when requested? &gt; If you insist on your anonymous type hack I don't insist on it, it's just the method that's been suggested on each of the top google results for "entity framework serialization" and it seems to work. &gt; At least I would definitely keep those methods out of your entity classes. Yeah, I think that makes sense.
This is really the most preferred approach (DTOs). You don't generally want or need to send every column of your entity object across to transport layer. Make DTOs and use AutoMapper to alleviate the pain.
Thanks for the tips, I zoom in on other videos.
&gt; That's a concern and not something I've read about. I thought the whole point was that, through Lazy Loading, it only does the proxy stuff when requested? It is something you always have to keep in mind. When you enable Proxy generation, then you always deal with proxies instances - no matter if you actually use the functionality with that very instance, or not. The instances of your entities will derive from a runtime generated proxy class to enable the lazy load navigation properties, coming to... Navigation properties. When you access a navigation property that has not been preloaded, it will automatically query the database to retrieve the missing related entities. This is handy, but you always have to keep in mind: You are querying the database. Now imagine a case, where you want to sent a letter to all pupils of a specific teacher. A naive and quick approach would be: var teacher = database.Teachers.First(); foreach (var pupil in teacher.Pupils) { SendLetter(pupil.Address); } If you don't preload Pupils and Pupils.Address, it will load those entities when you access the property. In this case: You access Pupils - the collection will be loaded. Then you iterate over each pupil, and for each pupil you will fetch the address from the database. This makes n+1 additonal queries. Of course you can avoid this easily by adding a `.Include(x =&gt; x.Pupils.Select(y =&gt; y.Address))` when fetching the teacher, however, this is very easy to be forget. That's why I personally dislike the proxies (and lazy loading) really much.
trying to do some reading on this - does POCO classes (I really thought I mentioned I was using them but looks like I didn't) override this? .Include isn't available.
`Include()` is a method of `DbSet&lt;T&gt;`. You should load all resources you need with one query (if possible): var teachersWithPupilsAndTheirAddresses = database.Teachers.Include(x =&gt; x.Pupils.Select(y =&gt; y.Address));
Thanks everyone: I have to be out of the office all day today. But - your answers are wonderful, and I will have more questions (I'm sure) after I've had time to really go through them and think about them in context of my project. Pavilion
Thanks very much for the explanation!
http://www.learnvisualstudio.net This has some good C# tutorials for beginners, does not cost that much either. Best of luck man, you'll get there.
Thank you very much for the detailed and simplified explanations and corrections. I'm going to be reading this for the next week! It will be great to comprehend a piece of OOP.
My simple suggestion would be to make a UserControl out of your DataGridView and its event code. You write it once, then reference the control in your form for each instance.
You're welcome. Be sure to see [W1N9Zr0's correction](http://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/1wwut7/unusual_for_me_array_question/cf6ijvs) to my explanation.
It's actually very easy. Make a boolean. When you press start, check to see if boolean is true or false and set it to its opposite. While bool == true, display screen.
Holy crap dude im an avid rust player myself. I make myself tons of hacks with C#.
if you have an .edu email address you can get a free version of Visual Studio Pro
How does that contribute?
FYI.. I just bought a new game.
Yep, look up DreamSpark
And if you don't understand something, there's most likely something about it on the web already (mostly on StackOverflow). Just google `c# array initialization` for example to find loads of sites explaining how to do that and possibly even more :)
indirectly. VS is the quintessential IDE for C#. The express version will be more than enough for hacking around yourself. The higher versions have features that are more geared more towards the enterprise. 
Not sure to upvote or downvote. You should probably specify if you're using the word "hack" as quick little programs, or programs to help you cheat.
Ok?
I wanted to make a course that would give the student a strong foundation to coding, with later videos for interface design. However, I'm not sure if either Android or iOS use C# or not, since I've never coded on those platforms. I do think that programmers in general are in great demand, so anything that you learn could be used in the future. If you are still in school, I've been told by the managers at educator that many schools have free access to the site, so you might want to contact your school's IT department and see if that is the case. I hope you enjoy the course!
Visual Studio Professional + Resharper the best thing you can get, however this is pricey, you can get Visual Studio Express one but it lacks some of the neat features like support for addons. I like to code for Unity so I usually choose monodevelop IDE for C# development but it also lacks for some features. 
I will treat you as if you know what hacking is and you do not mix it with cracking and changing the programs code. To hack programs made with .net is easiest after java, specially with reflection and if the code is not obfuscated, but I'm not encouraging this because they didn't made it opensource or for hacking, try hacking opensource projects for education, and respect other's property. 
What platform is your "c# application" compiled for ? You cannot call across 32/64 bit DLLs - So if your app is compiled as x86 it is 32bit. If your target is "Any CPU" - then on a 64bit OS you will get the 64bit DLL version of kernel32.dll ? Or did you ask for something else, whats is it that you *really* want to do ?
VB? *barf*
It's being compiled as 'any cpu'. I'm trying to run the command vssadmin list shadows, so I can then determine what VSCs exist on the system. However, when I run it, I get an error - 'class not registered'. I wrote a C++ version, that I've now scrapped because I couldn't wrap my head around MFC, and had the same error. To solve it, I had to use the example [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365743(v=vs.85).aspx) to disable redirection. I'm now trying to do the same thing in C#.
Yeah it's not bad.
Programs to help me cheat.
A video as opposed to a jpeg doesn't seem like it would take much more load off of a drive, as all you're really doing is losing the header information. When we have cameras dropping large files we usually set up multiple drives and cascade save them to each. IE: Pic1-&gt;Drive1 2-Drive2 3-Drive3 4-Drive1
What's the average file size and write speed of the hard drive and bus?
At least you're honest!
about 80kb per file, the drive is a 1tb [Samsung 840](http://www.samsung.com/uk/consumer/memory-cards-hdd-odd/ssd/840-evo/MZ-7TE1T0BW-spec)
There's nothing wrong with type inference. Of course, sometimes it's useful to have both the types of left and right hand sides of a variable assignment. Mostly not though.
Hello WillHaney - Yes I had thought of writing/using a custom function. But after reading about generic event handlers, I decided to use this project test as a way of learning about them. I've used custom functions for years in jQuery, and it's a valid way to handle these things. But I figured if I'm in C#, it doesn't hurt to learn about writing custom event handlers either. 
&gt; I had a few former managers call me to get the passwords and I said no. I left under bad circumstances and wasn't going to help them whatsoever. Def add threading then, the code emptying the buffer never really gets a chance to catch up because it must switch context from saving the file to listening for the next batch of data. It cannot do both of these operations at once on a single thread and so it falls behind and eventually you max out your buffer. With a thread dedicated to saving off files you will always be draining your buffer, then its a matter of finding the right buffer size to account for your IO latency. 
Hello dontera: I am interested in learning more about this. In addition to all the DataGridViews that will be used in this application, each DataGridView will have corresponding textboxes affiliated with them. The textboxes will be grouped and displayed in panels beneath the Datagridviews. Examples of the different counts/totals textboxes are: 1. Total employee CT (for that workstation) 2. Total senior ranking employees 3. Total apprentice employees 4. Total number of years at the workstation 5. Average number of years at the workstation So, if there is a way to treat the dataGridView and it's corresponding counts/totals textboxes as one unit/userControl and then reference the control for each workstation that would be wonderful. But - I've only about 20-30 hours of exposure to C#, so even though the concept makes sense, I've no idea how to do the concrete work of it. Any documentation you could provide would really help. Thanks in Advance - Pavilion
Here is a basic tutorial on UserControls http://asp.net-tutorials.com/user-controls/introduction/ and here are the MSDN articles on them http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/26db8ysc(v=vs.85).aspx let me know if you have any specific questions.
The fact that you have to hover over something to see its type means that it is inherently less readable. Using var liberally is a bad idea, it should be used sparingly. I usually use it when the type is implied and not really relevant, mostly as the result of LINQ extension methods that is known return an IEnumerable. One that sticks out in my mind is the GroupBy method `foreach(var group in myObjects.GroupBy(x =&gt; new {x.Property1, x.Property2})) // do something with each group` or `var imageFiles = fileNames.Where(x =&gt; imageExtensions.Contains(x, comparer))` I would never do: `var count = 0`
Umm, there's a lot of people who don't like using var. It can cause errors and it can make the code less readable. His rationale may have been wrong, but being explicit about variable types is a good thing. 
Not everyone writes database apps, I agree with you except EF. Although, I could learn EF easily enough.
Are you sure it's the SSD that's not keeping up? Based on 80KB/file and 200 files/second that's ~16MB/s of medium-large writes, which is more than an order of magnitude less than what the EVO should be able to keep up with (see http://www.anandtech.com/bench/product/962). Try taking a trace using the Windows Performance Recorder and look at it using Windows Performance Analyzer to find the bottleneck (if you know how), or run performance analysis from Visual Studio and look at what the program is spending most of its time doing. 
No but as a senior C# dev you should know how to use OR/Ms
You can't take a raw performance number in this case. You need to account for the fact that you are running managed code within a VM that must make a request to the operating system for disk access.
Can't you do it on the database?
I don't have access to the database. I'm querying a website (bricklink.com) for the information. I gather the store names by parsing the Price Guide page for each part in a given list. Also, as I mentioned, I'm a beginner so I'd have no idea what to do with the database anyway. :)
Many file systems have problems with a large number of files in one folder. So, if nothing else, make sure to create sub folders so you never store more than a few thousand files in one folder.
You should put the sleep and exit on a different thread. Do something like ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem( ()=&gt; { Thread.Sleep(5000); Application.Exit(); }); That tells the ThreadPool to start the lambda as soon as it has an available thread. I'd like to provide feedback on your sample code, but pastebin isn't accessible at work.
Which IDE? You can compile through [command-line](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/78f4aasd.aspx)
Right now I'm using Notepad++, Which I'm not in love with, but I have reservations about VSE.
I wouldn't call Notepad++ (great program!) an IDE. It is more of a DE since it's missing most of the Integrated part in IDE. VS is a pretty good IDE, you should give it a try.
You can use SharpDevelop instead. Link below: http://www.icsharpcode.net/opensource/sd/
Just little things- * I don't want to create a MS account just to download it. * I prefer open-source whenever possible. * etc... But I'm new to C# and I might just be talking out of my ass here. Would you recommend VSE?
If you're developing for .NET 4.5 the best option would be to use `await`. private async void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { await Task.Delay(5000); Application.Exit(); }
I'm going to assume that this is the problem you want to solve: &gt; I'm writing a program that gathers a list of stores, a list of parts, and then a list of those parts that are available from each of the listed stores. So we can sum it up as this: _Given a list of stores and a list of parts, return a list of each part that is stocked in every single store._ We can accomplish this with a simple foreach loop. Foreach loops iterate through an entire collection (Specifically an [IEnumerable](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.ienumerable.aspx) collection, which includes arrays/dictionaries as I see you're using). List&lt;Part&gt; results = new List&lt;Part&gt;(); foreach (Part p in sortedparts) { for (int i = 0; i &lt; stores.Count; i++) { if (!stores[i].Contains(p.id)) { break; } else if (i == stores.count) { results.Add(p); } } } Here we see that for each part, we check through the list of stores and make sure each individual store contains that part. If the store doesn't contain the part, we break out of the loop. If _i_ == stores.count and we haven't already broken out of the loop, we know that each store must have evaluated .Contains(p.id) as true, or else we would've broken out of the loop before _i_ reached its final value. I'll leave the LINQ answer here in case you want to research for yourself but I'm low on time. &gt;List&lt;Part&gt; results = sortedparts.Where(p =&gt; stores.All(s =&gt; s.Contains(p))).ToList(); I apologise if I'm underestimating your experience or if this isn't the problem you were trying to solve.
Create three classes, Store, Part and Stock. Store class has fields Store ID (Int) and Store Name (String.) Part class has fields Part ID (Int) and Part Name (String.) Stock class has fields Store ID, Part ID and Quantity (Int or Decimal, depends on if its items counted by quantity or volume.) From here, create Store instances for each one of your stores and items, storing them in seperate lists. Then create one more list of Stock and load it using the Part and Store indexes as well as the part quantity. Does this help?
&gt; the full version is DAMNED expensive and worth every penny. Which "full version" are you referring to? Premium and Ultimate, definitely very expensive and only necessary for some high-end enterprise level usage. Professional version is arguably not that expensive. At $500 the benefits you get from it and the [copious amounts of free (or paid) extensions](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/site/search?f[0].Type=VisualStudioVersion&amp;f[0].Value=12.0&amp;f[0].Text=Visual%20Studio%202013&amp;sortBy=Popularity) are a _huge_ productivity saver; it easily pays for itself in time saved. Of course, "expensive" is all relative; $500 for one person would be too much swallow just to dabble in .NET development. If it's your day job or you spend significant time developing .NET, it's a no brainer. And yes, Mr\_McFisticuffs, I would definitely recommend VSE. It's simply one of the best (arguably _the_ best) free .NET IDEs out there. If you're hardcore anti-Microsoft anti-closed source, then at least try some of the open source alternatives (sharpdevelop, monodevelop) instead of using Notepad++. But other than super strong principled reasons for staying away from Visual Studio, you should at least give VSE or VS Professional (trial) a shot as a _baseline_ for what typical .NET development is like in the industry.
Why TreadPool over Task?
I too like to support open source, but if you are going to use a .Net language you should probably at least try VS out. I haven't really used the free one, but based on the feature set I will tell you that the developing experience you will have using it over a straight text editor will be astronomically better, especially if you are doing anything that is even moderately complex. 
Are you receiving JPEGs from the camera or compressing them in your app? If your input format was JPEG, I was going to suggest MJPEG for a container, but apparently [there is no standard for it](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/885160/what-is-the-specifications-for-motion-jpeg)! But you can pick whichever version of the ones linked satisfies your needs better, or just write your own headers and JPEGs into a single stream. You can also play around with the buffer size parameter of FileStream to group your writes into larger chunks that might give you better performance.
Pretty sure .NET CLR does not make IO an order of magnitude slower :P
Not generally however peppering it with 200+ requests per second is not something that would be considered normal operation either. If it was one big fIle that is one thing. Each request is going to have overhead like it or not.
Visual Studio, hands down best IDE ever made. MonoDevelop and SharpDevelop are okay. But nothing beats Visual Studio. Microsoft has done at least one thing right. Add on plugins from DevExpress and Telerik and you will be rocking like never before.
Try flipping your data structures upside down. Keep a list of parts and then on your part object keep a list of stores which stock the part. Depending on what your sortedstores data structure is and what id is, you are probably iterating the entire list everytime you do contains. A hash table will help speed up those lookups too, so take a look at using a HashSet if you can. The id property should hopefully implement a specific GetHash method (strings and integers do this for you).
Task or TPL are probably better. I just know the ThreadPool syntax off the top of my head, and for this purpose, it works fine. If you're running something in a heavily threaded environment that does more than just exit, then you'll notice the difference. This blog explains why: http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog/New-And-Improved-CLR-4-Thread-Pool-Engine.aspx
What do you mean nope? Can I see your code? It should work flawlessly. I've used it in several games I've made. Should be something like this: if(newButtonPress &amp;&amp; !oldButtonPress) { displayMenu = !displayMenu; } for graphics: if(displayMenu) { //TODO: DRAW MENU }
I'd absolutely recommend Visual Studio. I'd recommend switching languages away from C# and the MS stack if your reservations are so strong that you won't use VS. Any job you get writing C# will require you to use VS.
It's also not really an unreasonable number of requests. I just wrote a quick benchmark, and my system had absolutely no trouble at all keeping up with 200 files/second.
Just get Visual Studio. It is an absolute God send and I cannot believe people work without it.
Sorry, the end result is finding the least expensive combination. I can calculate the price for all valid combinations, but finding those combinations is the time consuming part (because of the O(n^5) loop). I'm looking to make that more efficient.
I apologise.. rereading my question it was unclear what I was actually after. :/ I'm looking for the least expensive combination of 5 stores (or less) There's no way around calculating the cost of each combination, but finding all valid combinations is proving tricky.
Yes, you can compile programs without Visual Studio. The .NET Framework includes a command-line compiler, csc.exe. So for example: C:\&gt;cd \Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319 C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319&gt;d: D:\&gt;type test.cs using System; namespace HelloWorld { class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!"); } } } D:\&gt;c:csc test.cs Microsoft (R) Visual C# Compiler version 4.0.30319.17929 for Microsoft (R) .NET Framework 4.5 Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. D:\&gt;test.exe Hello, world! 
I had not thought of that. I will try it out.
if you are a student you can professional for free just create a BS ms account if you dont want to give your info to microsoft if you walked into a programmer job interview and said you are c# programmer and have no VS experience you would likely be laughed out of the office 
The only thing I can think of is to make sure the program is getting to that line of code. I would use some break points and step through the program execution to make sure it attempts to execute that line of code. Also if you post your code here that can help people debug. Breakpoints are one of the MOST helpful things in the world.
if we could see your code it would be mucho helpful 
https://github.com/Team-Cerionn/RustEssentials/blob/master/RustUtilities/Util/Load.cs This isn't to rip it, it's because I'm wondering what code Rust (a game) server mods use.

I've been seeing VS2012 Pro for ~$150. Pretty good deal if you don't need the latest/greatest.
You're code is probably throwing an unhandeled exception before the readline 
Thanks all.
Well, it goes with the key point I highlighted above: the CellFormatting event fires when a cell is repainted. Since your Hire Date column is hidden, it never needs to be painted on the screen, and therefore, you'll never get a ColumnIndex of 3 since the event fires for each cell that needs to be repainted. This tells me you're using the wrong event to handle what you want to do, or you're going about the wrong way doing this. Why do you need to update the value in UA_Yr_Txt every time the screen is drawn? Don't you really only want to do that one time?
Is it buffering input in someway? My only guess after reading everyone's comments.
How much experience do you have?18 Years How much experience did you have when you received your certification? 3 Did it help you with finding jobs / getting hired? BigTime Did it increase your salary? Bigtime Was it worth it? Yes Re-Upping my MCSD as we speak.
Why develop in C# if you want to use open-source software?
1. 9 years 2. I got MCAD, MCSD with no experience, MCTS (web, windows, distributed apps), MCPD with about 3 years 3. In the beginning after college it might have but I really doubt it. I think the interviewer said oh look at that and none of the other people I interviewed with cared it took like 20 interviews to get my first job. 4. Nope and switching jobs with the certs didn't give me anymore money 5. It is just a nice resume filler and it might have helped give me a tiny edge over people of my skill level. I like having them but they have not gotten me more money or jobs. I don't think where you are at right now it is worth it and won't help you. I'm very skeptical that it helped me get that first job. No one is ever impressed that I have them and I didn't even remember I had them until I read this thread.
[Here is the C# code.](http://pastebin.com/bb5QxgU6) 
I tried using breakpoints but it's like Visual Studio doesn't even recognize them. 
How hard is it? How do you train? 
Even better breakpoints: break on condition. I use it for certain cases as well as to test assumption (it always hit this when...). Especially useful for loops, so it breaks when it finally gets to the condition you need to investigate.
Nice try, M$. 
I think there may be something where companies get discounts or some sort of preferred licensing status depending on hoe many certified employees they have? If correct, could be a minor plus. 
Like scotty2012 said it could be an unhandled exception, you could try extending your try block to see if you can grab the error. If the breakpoints aren't being recognized it sounds like it could be referencing some code that's different from what you're looking at. I noticed you have it in your class definition to throw an exception if val isn't between 0 and 10, and in your for loop you're setting it to -1 to start. It might be erroring out there, but maybe it's breaking before that.
3 years of experience here. Don't have any certs. It's never come up in any interviews or pre-screening I've done and I'm currently doing contract work. Most developers I know don't have certs and most seem to think it's a big joke and waste of money.
Would I be wrong in thinking that certs are only good for impressing HR people ans recruiters?
It literally means nothing. I interview people all the time and could care less what their certifications are. The fact that you can download a book and remember some answers to questions has no merit on what know. Get experience at any cost and use it to your advantage.
TIL VS 2013 displays the returned value of a method 
I removed the other projects I had in the same solution and it runs fine now. I don't know what could have stopped it from working just because there were other projects in the same solution. Is it possible that the other projects were interfering with this one and that's why it was acting weird? 
To digress: I think using = and == for two completely different things was a mistake in C (or wherever it first showed up).
Conditional and When-Hit breakpoints increased my debugging quality of life exponentially.
If you're just looking for ideas/suggestions, you could look into SQL Server as well. It has very specific file handling, and since it is built with performance in mind, I figure it might help you out? Disclaimer: I have not tried this myself, nor do I claim it to be a good (let alone the best) way, but it deserves mentioning. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13420305/storing-files-in-sql-server
It is something I've considered... I'll add that to the list of things to try, thanks
.
Well what you're trying to do is effectively replicate functionality that's existed and been tried and tested in RDBMS's for over 20 years. Databases are awesome at bringing back data that matches a particular set of criteria so perhaps databases should be next on your learning list :) How often do you scrape the website? If it's on a set schedule (say, once a day, hourly, etc.) then scraping and inserting the data into a database ready for querying would definitely be the better solution - it also means you can do this with a central "scraper/data management" application, resulting in a database that's queryable by multiple instances of your application without each one having to do its own work. I assume you're scraping anyway, since you mentioned parsing. If it's on-demand, then perhaps moving to a scheduled scrape would be a better solution? Ultimately, any solution that involves reading data from a source that it wasn't intended to be machine-read from isn't going to be anywhere near as efficient as getting access to the data in its original form.
When I put this routine on the load event (because I thought it was only necessary to do the action once).... I would lose the values whenever I refreshed the datagridviews. And this happens a lot. Every time a user drags/drops employees from one workstation to another, there is a SQL UPDATE statement is triggered. After the SQL is executed the workstation datagridviews are refilled with data. So... I'm new to all this .. and there may be a better way around it. But when the datagridviews were refilled with updated data, the years of service column was going blank. So... I tested different events to see which event would re-calculate the UA_Yr_Txt field with every refill of data from the database. And the event that seemed to work best (at the time) was the cellformatting event. Just so you know, last night I tried the CellValueChanged event that you suggested. That event does not include .value as an e. option. So... then I went back to the cellformatting event. I'm very open to more efficient ways of handling this data. But the field populated by this calculation is unbound. So ... every time I refill the datagridview bindingsource after an UPDATE routine, the calculation has to rerun and refill the appropriate unbound textbox cell. Does that help you visualize the situation? Thanks again - Pavilion
Yeh - to be a Microsoft partner of any sort you need to employee people with those qualifications. I used to work at a gold partner and they'd pay people to take the exams but it was just to get the partner status and not for any technical reason. Ultimately though, they would rather hire people with those qualifications so if you had it and applied there, it would help.
TIL how to clean up the Output window. Finally, it becomes useful !
ok cool, looks like I accidentally hit the nail on the head! thanks very much
Hard to put weight behind a programmer's opinion when said programmer doesn't know how to format markdown... ^^^sorry ^^^^^no ^^^^^i'm ^^^^^not
Unlike that other recent debugging article posted to this sub, these actually are .net debugging tips :)
Is that not something that you'd have to remember to remove before your software ships (i. e. release bits)?
Only when you run .NET 4.5.1 - VS2013 is not enough.

Yes, this is intended only to temporarily debugging a loop that would take forever to run if you use conditional breakpoints. If you want to leave the code in, Debug.Assert() is a better way to go.
~~[Buffer.BlockCopy](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.buffer.blockcopy.aspx) can copy data between multi-dimensional and simple arrays, you should probably use that unless you want to arrange your stream in a different order then it copies the elements in.~~ Edit: Oops, didn't read all your code, you're not just re-shaping the array. You should name your variables more descriptively. "Array" tells me absolutely nothing about what's stored in the array, same with "GridArray". And worst of all "Obj", everything is an object in OOP, and the "Test"-somethings. Step through your code with the debugger and see if it's going in all the right places to give you output.
Go for a degree; not a certificate. In my experience, employers will **always** favor an applicant with a degree (even an AS/AAS) over someone with a handful of certificates. 
A degree will give you the time to learn the skills you need to be useful in a career setting, probably have a chance to do an internship too which could lead to a job
You should take a look at **Reactive Extensions** and the **Observer pattern**, thou it might be a bit too much for a beginner. That is a by far better way to do this, because the Worker should NOT know anything about the UI.
I was a SharePoint developer for about 2 years, you'd think that would be worth something. An AS would take like 3-4 years while working some job I'm overqualified for. I guess that's my biggest concern with going for it. 
Sorry about the names, Array has the position of Obj stored, Obj is the "thing" to save. Obj is defined through Dim Bytes. Dim^4 is also the highest amount of bytes per file that can exist. I've set it to be a max of 65536 bytes at the moment, but thats just a thing i needed in the first version where i stored empty slots aswell. GridArray has all the other values from the file I save to in it,.. For every SaveJob there is a loadjob that goes ahead. So before i made changes i just wrote 16* 0 for empty slots, now I want to just store actualy "things", so in the change I took Obj [1] Obj[2] and Obj[3] so the loadjob knows where the object belongs in the gridarray Obj[0] is the first identifier for what Obj is
It never asked me that. I must have done something but I don't know what. But it's working now. 
I'll get started on database reading. I thought linq might help, as I recognize some of the statements are similar to sql queries. For now I don't have any plans for large scale, I only download information when it's required. it's meant to be run by an end user. 
I'm stupid :p &gt; if(GridArray[x,y,z,0] == 0){ &gt; &gt; }else{ &gt; if(x == Array[0] &amp;&amp; y == Array[1] &amp;&amp; z == Array[2]){ &gt; Testi[offset] = Obj[0];} &gt; else{ &gt; Testi[offset] = GridArray[x,y,z,0]; &gt; } &gt; offset += 1; &gt; Testi[offset] = x; &gt; offset += 1; &gt; Testi[offset] = y; &gt; offset += 1; &gt; Testi[offset] = z; &gt; offset += 1; &gt; &gt; &gt; for(byte i = 4; i &lt; FourthDim; i++){ &gt; Testi[offset] = GridArray[x,y,z,i]; &gt; if(x == Array[0] &amp;&amp; y == Array[1] &amp;&amp; z == Array[2]){ &gt; Testi[offset] = Obj[i]; &gt; } &gt; offset +=1; &gt; &gt; } &gt; } It can't even get to the writing because the first line cancels out anything being written :P if(GridArray[x,y,z,0] == 0){ 
I did three puzzles. I think I'll stick with Project Euler.

Hey, I'm thinking about getting an AS in Computer Programming! I think it's a great idea. I think employers prefer a degree more than a certificate. 
I would recommend the same book cincibcat9 recommended (Pro Asp MVC 4), really great book for learning ASP MVC, that is if you have a little experience with C#, .Net(EF, ASP) and general programming skills /patterns (IoC and TDD). The ecommerce tutorial on the oficial microsoft asp MVC site is really good for grasping the basics.
do not listen to that "advice". As others have mentioned, the worker shouldn't be aware of the ui
Also works in Windows 8.1 apps which aren't quite .NET 4.5.1
Do I need to add namespaces for that or something? It has a red line under it. 
I tried their JS tests, first I thought I was doing something wrong, but when it said Test Failed: Expected: [1,2,3], instead got: [1,2,3] I just gave up
Pascal had the right idea... if a = b then c := d;
Maybe the type was wrong?? As in you returned a string when it was expecting an array? I don't know.
Haver never been certified for C#. Was once certified for Delphi, but really can't say it helped. If you are a quality employee, your reputation tends to precede you. I suppose the same is true if you are a hard to work with clod.
erode: Thank you for your valuable input. I posted from my phone. **Suck my Balls**
I simply took the curriculum outline and tried to hit every point. I then used one of the test prep programs and ended up memorizing some of the finer more useless points. You will end up learning a ton you did not even know existed.
Haha. Well, you've got a good sense of humor on ya.
This website is crazy slow at the moment.
I considered certification at one point in my career but ran across too many people with certificates that couldn't actually accomplish anything practical, so I decided to avoid it. Fifteen years into my career my bias against certification has only solidified, not only because of the (lack of) quality of the people that have them but because the people who have great experience and can get things done generally don't. It seems that if you really know something then your knowledge and accomplishments represent it better than a certification. If you want to learn something then learn it and find a good way to use it. Skip the cert.
Try to add `System.Threading.Tasks`.
I mean you need it to be installed. :-) Which is pretty surely the case when you urn Windows 8.1
It seems the consensus is that Certifications aren't very valuable, overall. That said, What about Awards? Certifications that you pay for are one thing, but for things like the MVP Award they basically ship you an interesting package, certificates, and you get a complimentary MSDN subscription as well, and they ask nothing in return but encourage you to keep it up. 
This is why I love javascript! &lt;sarcasm/&gt;
Ok I'll start looking for another solution! Just out of curiosity though, why should a worker not know about the UI? 
:P I actually do love JavaScript. I use Java, C#, Python, and JavaScript most often, and JavaScript is probably my favorite of those.
I'm curious, but why? Have you tried to make large applications with it (meaning apps which have multiple layers and modules) on a team with 4 or more developers?
Hah, I'm not THAT silly, so no. I'm not that skilled at JS, but I'd imagine it might have been comparing references or something.
Project Euler is like crack. 
Yes, why? I'm curious. I hate JavaScript, I think it's [overused](http://www.reddit.com/r/atwoodslaw/), I mean, take look at Node.js, server side JavaScript? Really? Could someone tell me why I should use server side JavaScript instead of something more powerfull and reliable? Before someone thrown stones at me, I do use JavaScript at a daily basis, but it's just on the client side and simple stuff with jQuery, like form validation, some effects, etc.
I don't see C#
Going from procedural programming to object orientation. Stay far far away from static methods.
Here in Sweden, it's pretty common that you get a bonus if you take come certs (and they pay for them, you only have to "pay" with your time studying). That's pretty nice.
Maybe you could give freelancing/contracting a go?
This is where OP should have started looking. Thanks for doing his job for him. You are awesome. Have some cake :)
Start looking for open source projects to contribute to. Start making your own applications in your free time. There's nothing wrong with learning it the way that you did... in fact, the best programmers I know were self taught. Essentially though, practice makes perfect. Come up with an idea and learn how to do it or join a project and learn that way. Either way will give you more experience in problem solving with code.
There is no spoon, friend. You might get down modded for content, but I certainly understand your feeling and wanted to offer some reassurances. The scarecrow didn't need a brain, he needed a piece of paper tell him he was smart. If you don't think you are a programmer, what have you been doing? If you are looking for external validation (and that is precisely what a degree is) then I don't think you will find a better validation than the fact that someone pays you reasonably well to do it for a living. 
A sealed class is a class that cannot be derived from - i.e. String. And you say you're not a fan of OR/M - that's fine, I never said you had to use it, I said you had to be familiar with it - in case your client/company says use it.
&gt;the best programmers I know were self taught I have to heartily agree.
Thanks for the reply, I have been practicing as much as I can since I first started, making apps that do this or that for fun. I even evolved a sort of make-shift self teaching curriculum from things i saw online and in books. Being self-taught is just nerve wracking, because I feel like I might be able to write this big, awesome application years down the road, and then someone looks at the source code and says "why do you have all this unnecessary code that achieves the same thing as &lt;basic C# concept&gt;?" And I will have never known that the concept even existed to be learned.
When you constantly hunger to learn more, and when you begin to teach others.

A quick look on monster shows freelance sharepoint dev earns upwards of £350 per day in London. Is it lower where you are?
When a real company pays you to write real code (not markup) then you are a real programmer.
crack sifted with a sieve of eratosthenes
when a company pays you on an on going basis to write code. just stick with it, with time and experience you will hopefully get to a point where you feel like you can handle just about anything you need to. just keep in mind you really can't know everything there is to know. someone will always know something that you don't. don't let it intimidate you. you probably will focus on a handful of areas. 
I have not worked on a JavaScript project with 4 team members, but I have worked on one with 2. Probably the largest (purely) JavaScript project I worked on had something like 5 modules and about 5,000 lines of code using the Google Closure Library and the Closure Compiler. I think a lot of hatred for JavaScript comes from working with the DOM and having to deal with cross-browser support. I will readily admit that this is a huge pain in the ass, but it's unavoidable when working with so many kinds of clients (browsers). JavaScript (in this context, I'm referring to Ecmascript 5) as a language is quite simple and elegant. I can do most, if not all other things I might be able to do in a "proper" language like Java and Python that I can in JavaScript. I also really like how easy it is to work with functions. Sure, there are some other quirks like NaN and Infinity, but every language has its small defects and peculiarities. Probably what I enjoy most about it is the ability to have any computer be a development sandbox. All I need to do is open Chrome, inspect any element (or hit F12), go to the console, and start writing code. Just about every other language requires the installation of something (compiler/interpreter, whatever) before writing code is possible. With this, I could go to my mom's house and doodle some code without having to install anything. So, I think maybe it's better for me to ask: &gt; "Why don't you like JavaScript?"
Yes. That's kind of what I wished for. Thanks dude.
What about JavaScript running on the server makes it unreliable? You no longer have to worry about browser compatibilities. It won't be as fast as a compiled language like C, but people are working on getting JavaScript to compile down to native machine code which would nullify that issue.
In the "computer screen", below the language options, there is a "Don't see your languages? &lt;vote&gt;"
In Form1.Designer.cs the only line that mentions the NumericUpDown is &gt; public System.Windows.Forms.NumericUpDown numPeople; I thought double clicking the NumUpDown would automatically create an event handler. I went back and double clicked the NumUpDown and literally just copy and pasted the code so it reads &gt; private void numPeople_ValueChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) { dinnerparty.NumberOfPeople = (int)numPeople.Value; DisplayDinnerPartyCost(); } private void DisplayDinnerPartyCost() { decimal Cost = dinnerparty.CalculateCost(healthyBox.Checked); costLabel.Text = Cost.ToString("c"); } private void numPeople_ValueChanged_1(object sender, EventArgs e) { dinnerparty.NumberOfPeople = (int)numPeople.Value; DisplayDinnerPartyCost(); And now it seems to work fine. The text are the exact same, yet the first entry (ValueChanged, not ValueChanged_1) has 0 references. I'm completely confused as to why it would say that. EDIT: I've since deleted numPeople_ValueChanged and have only left numPeople_ValueChanged_1 and it seems to be working better. I still have to fix the math to get the correct prices displayed but it seems to have fixed the problem I was having. Any idea what might have caused this? I've been playing around with the code for a while, is it possible that I deleted something while editing it that was making it not display?
That means you didn't have the event handler setup. When you double clicked on the control it added an event handler: this.numPeople.ValueChanged += new System.EventHandler(this.numPeople_ValueChanged_1); It appended _1 because you already had this.numPeople_ValueChanged and created the empty this.numPeople_ValueChanged_1 method for you. &gt;Any idea what might have caused this? Probably copying and pasting code. 
I'm trying to make it so when I press Insert it shows or hides the program, I thought I had it figured out, but it isn't working because when I hide it, it doesn't listen, how do I keep it listening when it is hidden?
I understand why it made the ValueChanged_1() but I don't understand why the code I entered for ValueChanged_1 was able to be referenced but the original ValueChanged(). I'll tinker around with it some more today to see if I can figure some more things out. I apologize if this is all basic, I'm just starting to learn and I'm at a point where trying to combine all the small lessons I've had into one project is a bit overwhelming.
I'll send you to Scott Hanselman's blog post http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ImAPhonyAreYou.aspx and just say you are getting paid to do programming, you are a programmer. Feeling like an imposter seems to be a fairly normal thing, but it will only hold you back if you let it.
&gt;I understand why it made the ValueChanged_1() but I don't understand why the code I entered for ValueChanged_1 was able to be referenced but the original ValueChanged(). Because there was no event handler added. This part in form1.designer.cs: this.numPeople.ValueChanged += new System.EventHandler(this.numPeople_ValueChanged);
It's not about speed. It's about features of the language. Why use a horse when you have a car available? For teh lulz? I'm not criticizing JavaScript as a whole, I just fail to understand why people insists to use that everywhere. Just some [JavaScript WTFs](http://www.artificialworlds.net/presentations/javascript-wtfs/javascript-wtfs.html). Can you imagine how many programmers smash their keyboards everyday because of these? :D
If you're getting paid to write code you can call yourself a programmer or a rodeo clown. Who cares about labels anyway? Also, not many people have time to contribute to open source projects. I see that suggestion all the time and it's akin to telling someone to run a business on the side of their full time job. Keep going to work, googling, reading articles and buy programming books to review in your downtime at work. Then go home and relax if you need to. If you've got the energy you can always practice at home too but don't feel bad if you can't. Edit: Thanks for the gold whomever! I feel like I won an award. 
Yeah I am using this book too, it's pretty fun! What happened was that since you pasted that code into the class , including the event-handler mothod for valueChanged. But since you pasted in the method, it wasn't set up as an event handler for the control behind the scenes. 
There are only 2 designations for programmer really. Both start with a simple base. You have written a program and are intending to write more code and expand your knowledge. You are an amateur programmer if you do not get paid. You are a professional if you get paid (professionals often do amateur work as well like personal projects). It is that simple. Beyond that there is a range of skills and skill subsets but the consideration of betting a programmer or not is quite simple. 
Yes, you are &lt;insert profession&gt; after someone you don't know pays you to do it.
One step at a time and it will work in the end. 3D modeling, though...that's a different beast than programming!
Self taught as well. One day I decided to pick up a tome on VB6 (this was a long time ago,) and I worked through the whole thing until I had a handle on it. Then my boss (who himself was a programmer) allowed me to take over some of his codebases. I eventually did go back and get a formalized 2 year associate's degree in programming, but it was really just a technicality. 10+ years on, I'm the 'official' .net programmer in my group of engineers. Is there still a lot I could learn? Oh yes. I would love to go back and pick up a 'real' programming degree and learn more/better practices from the pros.
You sound exactly like me. You are a programmer. You're starting off small, and making small-time salary to match. (No offense.) As long as you love what you do, you'll do fine, and you'll grow. I suggest you buy a solid C# book [like the one I have at my desk](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-5-0-Building-Applications-Framework/dp/1449320414/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1391801624&amp;sr=8-13&amp;keywords=C%23) and study it. Yeah, it's a lot to take in, but just do it in bits (no pun intended.) Every now and again make it a point to try something new, like create a reusable component, DLL, or create a side project in another language (like vb.net, using the same Visual Studio IDE) etc., just to stretch your mind :)
&gt;At What Point Can One Call Themselves A Real Programmer? When you can code with a magnetized needle and a steady hand.
TheNewBoston is pretty cool, look him up. http://thenewboston.com That's where I started.
When can you call yourself a real programmer? When you've shipped something that end users find useful that wouldn't have been as useful without your code contributions. This can be shipped internal to the company, not necessarily to the great wide public. As to your laments that you feel like an imposter because your job hasn't given you any opportunity to work on things that grow your horizons... GOOD INSTINCTS. Don't hate your job, but plan an exit strategy. Keep doing your job professionally in the meantime. If your next job interviewer asks why you're leaving your current job, say something along the lines of "I'm thankful for the opportunity it gave me, but I feel like I reached the limits of how I could grow." Don't be afraid to accept a Java job, either. "Real programmers" are dogmatically loyal to one technology stack.
Gotcha. What chapter in the book are you on? I just got to this project and it seems exponentially harder than the other ones. Time to take it a bit slower I guess.
There are no good programmers who are not self-taught. Though they may be university-taught as well. ;)
You're not a real programmer until you've shipped something, IMO. Doesn't have to be big. Doesn't have to be to lots of people. Your code doesn't have to be even a significant minority of the end product. I hold this opinion because there are people who can talk about design all day, spend lots of time coding, etc. but not one line of their code ever actually makes it into production.
A website is cool, however I don't know what it is called of what I am looking for... 
That is really most of what a degree will get you, more and/or better programming practices. Not saying you shouldn't get a degree, but it will only really teach you what is above and beyond what you now know.
Someone is paying you to program? Your app is making you enough money you don't have to work nights at the Piggly Wiggly?? You're a programmer. If you're only building web pages for your friends and family or can make Excel do some cool tricks? Not so much. 
ALL programmers are self taught to some extent. 
I would say after a year of being paid to write vb or c# or any language with if statements and functions you can call your self a programmer. If you are worried about credentials and like asp.net then getting a Microsoft certification is pretty easy. 
Unfortunately, you can't do it the same way that you can if you passed it to a query/stored procedure (i.e. the method returns the number of rows affected). If I were you and you wanted to ensure the data has been pushed, I'd run a count(*) query on the table afterwards and compare it to the number or rows in the DataTable that you just submitted. If there's any data in the table before-hand, you could always run a count before and after, then compare the change to the number of rows to see if it all matches up.
There is perpetual learning in programming. You'll look back on stuff you did a year ago and think "OMG, what was I thinking?!", and next year you'll look back on what you are doing now and think the same thing. Even lead developer at my company (very talented programmer) will say "I wrote this a couple years ago, but it REALLY needs refactored, I don't know why I did it this way..." As long as you are learning, don't be embarrassed. Everyone starts somewhere. And even if you have experience with one thing, you might not with another. I worked 5 years as a web developer using C#, now I'm doing C# at a software company that provides enterprise solutions, it is a completely different skillset even though it's the same language. Edit: typo 
I just finished the lab#2 dungeon game. It took me longer than I'd care to admit to get it fully working and debugged :D
Cool video, so please keep at it, but I try to avoid making my desktop apps looking like a hack or keygen from the 90s
&gt; From the start, I absolutely fell in love with programming and decided to pursue a career starting with C#. There you go bud, you've got what it takes.
I believe this as well. It applies to all aspects of life, not just programming. Experience, whether real life or curriculum, is what solidifies a skillset. It is as simple as always wanting to progress past where you are today and then taking action to do so. 
Man that shit sells in the bar/entertainment industry. It's "hip"

99% of programming is self taught, we've got industry placement guys from our local uni that were laughing about how the stuff they were "learning" at uni they had been using at work for over a year.
People still use Windows Forms?
A certificate is like saying, I am competent at this skill and have demonstrated my ability and a degree is like saying, I have a strong foundation of knowledge and can excel at learning new things. The jobs which will push you to learn, favor applicants who are great learners. If however you want to stick forms into databases all day, you can get by with certificates. I'm not saying a degree is the only way to get a good career job but it does make things a lot easier. 
Haha :P i honestly didn't know what the theme looked like at the time. I was meant to look like a professional log in screen and not something out of Hackers -__-
I am not to sure. I believe the licensing is royalty free but i could be wrong. I will try and find the details for you after work :)
If it's an API: developer documentation If it's a user-feature: user documentation, and possibly training materials.
I got started about this time last year with [Pro ASP.NET MVC 4](http://www.amazon.com/Pro-ASP-NET-MVC-Adam-Freeman/dp/1430242361). I have a library card and was able to read it free at http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/. I also got really interested in [Entity Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/data/ef) too since you see it a lot in MVC examples. PS: Love me some [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) too.
There are definitely some great books and tutorials about there but there are so many technologies that it's extremely unrealistic to expect anyone to have comprehensive/advanced knowledge of that many frameworks. The most important thing is really that you can demonstrate that you are a competent C# software engineer, and have the ability to figure out new things as you go along. Have you also considered mobile development using Xamarin? Mobile development is pretty in demand right now.
Ok, I will try that. I didn't understand what you meant before. ;-) EDIT: Can you help? It says ! cannot be applied to buttonstates. If I can't use buttonstates, what do I use?
Take a look at training videos on pluralsight. 
It's not a problem, it's preferring to be more secure by default (and allowing to change the parameters if you know what you're doing). http://weblogs.asp.net/imranbaloch/archive/2010/04/23/understanding-400-bad-request-exception.aspx
Can I see your code?
Thanks. I guess my point was that I don't really agree with this interpretation of security. Ie and iis have historically had a limitation on URL lengths that nobody else had. (Which was kind of funny with the mess that was pre-mvc URLs.) Maybe it helps with iis overflows that it shouldn't have, I'd buy that. But it's still fixing a problem that shouldn't exist. Mono runs into compatibility problems because of things like this.
"If any of the above rules are not follow then you will get 400 Bad Request Exception. The reason for this restriction is due to hack attacks against web servers involve encoding the URL with different character representations." Sounds reasonable to me. And the registry "hack" (it's not a hack) is for power users to unlock/change it. Also, I would argue having your API with URLs structured that way (huge URL segments) doesn't make a ton of sense. You'd be better off with query string params or POSTing the data (yes, API-nazis would argue you'd never use POST for something that just returns data, but whatever. I've yet to hear a super compelling argument..), especially when you need to send a long list of IDs, etc to the server.

This is not a useful way to do log ins. The login information is being stored inside the executable which means that if you decompile the exe, it can be seen. Also, since it's being accessed internally, there is really little point to having it at all. If you were to give the program to someone, you'd have to tell them the password, so why set one in the first place? Also, when you are checking the user name, you are being case sensitive. Try using .lower() on the user name strings so that it becomes case insensitive. And the best practice for the password is to hash it and save a hashed version; then when someone logs in, hash that and compare the two. Something like a good AES will work well. EDIT: My mistakes, I forgot that AES is encryption. As /u/seligman99 said, SHA256 is a good hash to use. 
It's way, way more than just the browser issues. When I do javascript I use jquery anyway, which at least makes the UI issues much less of an issue. Here's a few of the fundamental problems I reject the language for off the top of my head: * Lack of type safety means I can't rely on a compiler as my first line of defense against developer errors * Lack of compiler means I can't determine what type expressions are, and reason about them automatically, making entire classes of mature software development tools unavailable: static model checking, compile-time expression evaluation, conversion errors, immutable and read-only inferences... * The standard library is weak, meaning I have to adopt some external library just to get basic work done without having to reinvent the wheel * Lexical scoping is horribly broken and workarounds are painful. We've been doing things better in other languages for nearly half a century, why must we put up with this? * Debugging and evaluating object state at runtime is not much better than using "console.write" everywhere. * Code navigation in an IDE is often just a guess, with a text search mostly being the only way to inspect code, making automated call stack diagrams impossible to generate. * Refactoring and unit testing are not mature concepts in JS. * Function-as-object with properties is an absurdity which we only accept because it's the only way. This is not a design, it is a hack. * Runtime type conversion and object prototype manipulation are neat for getting the dirty work done quickly, but once it becomes the source of subtle and hard to find bugs in a complex production system an insightful developer would realize that the extra keystrokes spent on the front end of the project would probably have been worth it. Whenever I talk about these issues, there are largely two kinds of defenders of javascript remaining, those who don't think these are really problems, meaning they haven't spent enough of their precious life finding and fixing issues caused by them to the point of pain rather avoided, or that they have done enough javascript where all these design defects have been assimilated into their character, and they handle it much like a native English speaker handles the abomination that is modern English - it's second nature. To that, I say, can't human kind do better? Why must we accept an ill-conceived language, just because it is so widely distributed? How much more collectively great would all the developers of the world be if we used a language that saved us from overworking our keyboards just to please a compiler _and_ told us when we are trying to add a number to a string?
To address your initial concerns, I would strongly recommend you use a compiler, like the Google Closure Compiler. The advanced mode does type checking and all the normal optimizations any other good compiler does.
While it's possible to build a hash function out of a block cipher like AES, it's not terribly common. Much better to use a hash algorithm like SHA256. Also, if you're going to hash a password, make sure to salt the input to prevent rainbow attacks.
AES is no hash algorithm, it's encryption. It can be reversed, it's two-way. Hash functions can't be reversed, they're one-way only. You should NEVER save your passwords encrypted, but always hashed.
*&lt;/sarcasm&gt;
Some of them are programmer fails. Like `for (index in [3, 2, 1])` lets index be the index and not the value. And array.sort() uses the alphabetical order and not the number values. Although that is kind of stupid of it. I was surprised there wasn't `[] + [] == ""`
This says: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.bindingcontext(v=vs.110).aspx That the BindingContext can be either a CurrencyManager or a PropertyManager. You can't reference it directly because it's an abstract class - it has to be one of it's derived classes. So I would check for null after doing your cast, and use that as an indication that it's the other type. 
A race condition is simply where the timing of separate computations impacts the result. Imagine two people are cooking. They are making some pasta. Person 1's job is to boil the water. Person 2's job is to measure the raw pasta and add it to the pot. The obvious desired outcome is that the water is boiling before person 2 puts the pasta in. If person 2 starts their task ten minutes after person 1 you can get the desired result. If person 2 starts at the same time as person 1; person 2 will have to wait (block) until person 1's task is complete. In c# you can use lock to signal that a resource needs to be exclusively held, such as the pot while person 1 is boiling water. I'm on my phone but a quick MSDN search will explain with examples. 
Race conditions appear when the threads access shared memory, such as class fields/properties, static fields/properties. When the Thread is working with it's own resources everything is fine.
Would it be possible to have each new thread create its own list of all previous moves that only it has access to? 
#####&amp;#009; ######&amp;#009; ####&amp;#009; Section 5. [**Example**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#Example) of article [**Race condition**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race%20condition): --- &gt; &gt;As a simple example let us assume that two threads each want to increment the value of a global integer variable by one. Ideally, the following sequence of operations would take place: &gt;In the case shown above, the final value is 2, as expected. However, if the two threads run simultaneously without locking or synchronization, the outcome of the operation could be wrong. The alternative sequence of operations below demonstrates this scenario: &gt;The final value is 1 instead of the expected result of 2. This occurs because the increment operations of the second case are not mutually exclusive. [Mutually exclusive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutually_exclusive) operations are those that cannot be interrupted while accessing some resource such as a memory location. &gt; --- ^Interesting: [^Symlink ^race](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symlink_race) ^| [^Mutual ^exclusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion) ^| [^Software ^bug](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug) ^| [^Deadlock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock) *^\/u/Kalroth ^can ^reply ^with ^'delete'. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less.* ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/) ^| [^flag ^a ^glitch](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/autowikibot&amp;subject=Glitched comment report&amp;message=What seems wrong: (optional description goes here\)%0A%0A---%0A%0AReply no. 50193:%0Ahttp://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/1xfjgz/can_someone_please_eli5_what_are_race_conditions/cfawx35)
Yeah, sure. When you're only reading (everywhere, not only within the thread), then there's no problem with race conditions either. Usually you'd pass the previous moves as a list to the new thread.
Even with the new pricing? 
I am surprised to hear you say that game development jobs are hard to come by. Given the popularity of mobile development in conjunction with Unity and MonoGame, I would've thought C# game development skills would be in high demand. But if you want to get started with web development, the official [asp.net](http://www.asp.net) website is probably where you want to start. They have tutorials and videos on all of the individual frameworks (Web Forms, MVC, etc.). Then I would recommend going to [Codeplex](https://www.codeplex.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) and reading through the source code for some of the projects there. It will give you a really good idea of how the concepts that you learn get used in real life. 
I'm presuming you have mostly informal experience or you're just starting so I'll try to keep this kinda ELI5. There's also a csELI5 subreddit you might like. So, a processor can only ever do one thing at once. It feels like you can do a million things at once but you're actually always doing one thing at once, and switching between all the things you want to do very very quickly. The "threads of execution" the processor switches between are threads. So when you start working with threads in your own code, you're diving down to quite a low level construct. There are dragons down there. In that sense it's comparable with doing your own memory management in C; you're working really close to the system and it's frontier law down there. This is why it can be difficult. So why do it? Sometimes you might want to explicitly make your own threads to handle some work. The main reason for wanting to do this are that you can then put each thread on a different CPU, run them in parallel, and finish quicker. (The operating system can't do this for you, because it doesn't know how. It can interleave your program with other programs it wants to run, but it has no idea which parts of your program are safe to split up and run in parallel. So you have to do it yourself to take advantage of all those extra CPU cores.) Once you've done this, you don't know when each thread will do its work. You know your threads will run in parallel but you have no idea how the CPU(s) will divide them up or how it will schedule them. This causes problems because if both of those threads are accessing some shared resource, you might see some unexpected behaviour. For an example, imagine two computers both printing to the same printer. Imagine if the printer printed pages with lines from both documents interleaved instead of printing them one after the other! Clearly the order in which these threads share the resource is important. It's called a "race" condition because the behaviour becomes dependent on which thread is faster. Another example; imagine you and me were both using the same whiteboard at the same time, and we aren't aware of eachother. The contents of the whiteboard are going to be a garbled and unusable mess. In another post you ask if a certain scenario with a jigsaw puzzle would constitute a race condition; when thinking about race conditions first identify what resources are being shared. The race condition will be a thread reading from or writing to some resource which has had its state changed without that thread's knowledge. The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. So, how do you avoid race conditions? There are a number of programming constructs which accomplish this. The key idea is to make it so that the shared resource can only be accessed by one thread at a time. Google locks, semaphors, monitors. These are things which allow threads to communicate or wait for a resource. 
One thing you could do for an AI in that case is have each new thread do a few things: Note: This will only be efficient memory-wise in a breath-first manner. 1) Create a new thread for each 'child' state. 2) Copy the current state into each 'child'. 3) After it's done creating all of its children, release its resources. Another option would be to create a tree in which each child is simply a move. Then, you just have to have an atomic "add child" method. When trying to determine the complete state, it just traverses the tree. This will be quite memory efficient, but not very processing-efficient, as there will be quite a bit of repeated computation. A middle ground may be to use the tree method, but include in each step both the next step and a list of possible steps after that. It stores some of the current processing completed in memory so you don't have to keep recomputing them. There's pretty likely also a dynamic programming version of this particular problem.
I've actually been thinking about how to do this problem. There must be some formula for finding the minimum amount of moves required for the worst case scenario. If each thread takes me to a new state of the board, it's reasonable to assume that it would find at least one optimal path to the goal state. Any threads that exceed the maximum amount of allowed moves would be removed. It seems logically sound to me, but I have no idea how to actually implement it yet. 
http://i.imgur.com/6tJ01ms.png from top to bottom is x going to be 30 or 40? if left/thread1 reaches the x operation first, then the final x will be 40 because (10+10)*2 = 40 but if thread2/right thread reaches the x operation first, then final x will be 30 because (10*2) + 10 = 30 That is my version of ELI5 on race conditions 
You can actually use A* to solve it pretty simply using a few different heuristics, such as the number of misplaced tiles.
Yeah, that was the one of the things I did when I took an AI class last semester. Now I'm just trying to find new ways to solve the problem using areas I'm not really strong with.
Thanks for that. I only understood about 50% of the issues but I was guilty of a few. The &lt;%: was a good one to know.
I would learn WebForms and MVC, those will probably give you the best chances of landing a gig and make you the most marketable. Also a knowledge of front-end coding is crucial (CSS, JavaScript, HTML) and a database (SQL, Oracle) and ORMs (Entity or micro-orms like petapoco). I have been a professional webdev for the last 12 years (mostly .net). CMS development can be lucrative as well.
Instead of using console.readline(); in my apps, I use console.readkey(); to keep the window from closing. Never have had a problem.
FWIW, I was really impressed by [John Carmack's talk about immutability and functional-style programming](http://functionaltalks.org/2013/08/26/john-carmack-thoughts-on-haskell/). He is talking about the world state and how the different objects get access to their own copy of it, so there's no race condition possible. Another thought - if I wanted to do some jobs in parallel, I would choose a higher level abstraction. I mean Task is available, we are not doing anything close to the metal, why not do it the easy way and concentrate on the logic instead? Just launch the tasks, and await Task.WhenAll(). Or perhaps you are interested in any solution, just bruteforcing through them - then Task.WhenAny() could be appropriate. Locks, waits, semaphores and all other (insert expletive here) just makes me nauseous. ZeroMQ Guide has a nice short [explanation here](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#Multithreading-with-MQ) about what makes multithreaded programming difficult. But in your case (the "15"), I don't really think you have that much of a shared state, the threads (or tasks) don't "look back", they simply generate their own new state each time they launch. Oh, and a final edit. I just stumbled upon Eric Lipperts's excellent explanation about avoiding deadlocks (I think we can safely call them a close relative to race conditions) http://ericlippert.com/2014/01/28/questions-from-tuesdays/#more-1855. The best point is the first one - Don't write multithreaded code!
There seems to be a class missing. I think there was supposed to be a "public class ArrayBank : IBank {" on line ~~93~~ 91 and a "}" on line 128. Edit: wrong line number
I'd say creating a global keyboard hook is the way to go for this. Here's an article http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/19004/A-Simple-C-Global-Low-Level-Keyboard-Hook Basically you'll need to call directly into the native libraries available and use P/Invoke to get at them. It's a little complicated but it's definitely possible.
As to "why", ArrayBank(int bankSize) was meant to be a constructor. Normally leaving the class declaration out would result in a compiler error closer to the actual problem, but here there's an outer class named Program, so the compiler interpreted ArrayBank as an ordinary method of the Program class and goes on. Later, when Main() tries to instantiate an ArrayBank, the compiler notices that ArrayBank is a method, not a class (or some other type) and gives the error.
Why'd you call it ArrayBankClass? It has to have the same name as the constructor. You also forgot the " : IBank". That's important.
Ups :D, and i had to remove the void from the constructor. But yes now the code is working, thanks for your help.
Ah, right. I didn't see that one.
Buy a library. You do not want to get into the OpenXML spec if you can avoid it. 
Can you recommend any ?
I have used [EPPlus](http://www.nuget.org/packages/EPPlus/) to successfully create Excel reports. You can get it through NuGet. It doesn't use the native code Office libraries which is a big plus.
My company uses [Aspose](http://www.aspose.com/) to generate reports in Excel, though I'm not sure sure if you want to pay for it/the free trial lasts long enough for your purposes.
I second the library option. We use GemBox which is excellent.
The Aspose one is good.
Its not for private use. I'm doing liek a work experince for school and needed to make this for them. but thnx for the recomandations
also thnx for the recomandation :) I'll look in to it and see wich the company likes more
thnx for the link I'll look in to it and the others ;)
It's cumbersome and time consuming. Since there are plenty of libraries that already do this for you, it is also a waste of time.
I second the use of EPPlus. 
This is a great place to start, but Asp.net and MVC are just frameworks for building web pages. If you want to be a great web developer, be sure you understand HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
Right. Its only worthwhile if you're writing a library for sale. And since there are already reasonably priced and well-designed libraries available - its a waste of time to learn it.
Take note that c# has [auto-implemented properties](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb384054.aspx), which means you don't have to do garbage get/set methods like java. Your interface becomes: public interface IAccount { void Deposit(decimal amount); bool Withdraw(decimal amount); decimal Balance { get; set; } string RudeLetter { get; set; } string AccountName { get; set; } } I don't have time to look through the whole example in the book, but let's hope this bank doesn't continue to let customers withdraw negative amounts. 
Try [msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/hh533273.aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/hh533273.aspx) Found that link from a similar question to yours on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5401567/how-to-implement-await-without-async-ctp)
Is this program running in the background on the managed machines?
You would only need to read your xml timestamp when the app starts. It shouldn't change (until they do the update), so you can just leave it in memory, and periodically check against the current time. The relevant structs in the framework you will need to use are System.DateTime and System.TimeSpan.
To me it sounds like you're stuck on a petty implementation detail without having a clear picture of really it is that you're doing. The first question is when/how does the notification dialog appear? On a schedule? On demand? If on demand, what was the trigger? How did you detect that trigger? How do plan to enforce upgrades? So my version of Firefox is expired. What will you do? Nag me about it? Disable my windows account? Are you concerned at all about users circumventing the system? What if I edit the XML so that all my versions expire in the year 3219? Suppose I just rename firefox.exe to firefax.exe, am I out of compliance then? Do you know how to keep your application up to date? Also, ever written a Windows Service? Seriously, if you're hung up on trying to figure out to best calculate a TimeSpan I know you are going to have much bigger problems real soon.
Decent reply, and I mean this in a constructive way, but the negativity could've been toned down a little at the end don't you think? 
Thanks. I'm planning on recording times in UTC so I shouldn't into locality issues. 
I agree with you. I purposefully began with "I am a beginning C# developer..." to try and avoid dick wagging (we all have to start somewhere right?). But at least there was *some* helpful content.
You could use Application settings for this also, I suppose. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/a65txexh.aspx Is this a web based app? i.e A windows form or a web form will be filled out? If it's a web you could use cookies, if it's just a deferral that doesn't need to be enforced seriously... I'm unsure about your implementation.
Perhaps this example may help? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2458205/simple-c-sharp-asp-net-cache-implementation
Thank you. This solved that problem.
Switch to 4.5? Async/await is bananas
Async-Await is [available](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9110472/using-async-await-on-net-4) for .NET 4
sure! protected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime) { ButtonState newStartState = GamePad.GetState(PlayerIndex.One).Buttons.Start; ButtonState oldStartState; oldStartState = newStartState; bool startMenuActive = false; Menu startMenu; if (newStartState == ButtonState.Pressed &amp;&amp; !oldStartState == ButtonState.Pressed) { if(startMenuActive == false) GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.Black); startMenuActive = true; startMenu = new Menu(new Vector2(200.0f, 200.0f), "Paused", "newTimesRoman", Color.White, Content); startMenu.draw(spriteBatch); if (GamePad.GetState(PlayerIndex.One).Buttons.LeftShoulder == ButtonState.Pressed) this.graphics.ToggleFullScreen(); if(startMenuActive == true) startMenuActive = false; }
I'm assuming you're using XNA? Your oldStateState and newStartState need to be booleans. You could use the following function to turn a ButtonState into a boolean. private bool GetButtonState(ButtonState buttonState) { if (buttonState == ButtonState.Pressed) { return (true); } else { return (false); } } Use it like so: bool newStartState = GetButtonState(GamePad.GetState(PlayerIndex.One).Buttons.Start);

For all the words it contains, your whole post asks a one trivial, unconstrained question (paraphrased: DAE store data?). Any answer given here would be technically correct, but ultimately many won't apply to your situation after the real requirements are known. You didn't ask about any of the big, hard, seriously need to think it aspects of what you're trying to do. That's very telling. It's not dick wagging for me to tell you that you're probably in over your head.
Feel your pain; very frustrating when locked into old environments. I understand the logic (typically some combination of cost, training, legacy systems), but it doesn't make it much easier to swallow from a coding perspective. Especially if you're locked into Vista compared with 7.
Naah, its XP rather than Vista. Noone in corporate America ever upgraded to Vista. We still have a bunch of users on XP tho.
A 200-page book forms the "basis" of a first year of programming? Hmmmm. 
I've written a temporary function that just returns a list of all it's children 3 generations deep, but I want it to be able to fetch all of the children up to an infinite amount of generations deep.
You could use a recursive method?
AHA! I have no idea what that is. I shall look it up, Now I have a place to start, Thanks! :D
Do you guys also know any good word library's? also thnx for the excel once :D
If you need an example just give me a shout, I am on my phone but i shall try my best :)
Use a `Timer` class. The .net framework has at least three to choose from each with slightly different use cases.
If it's not meant to be read by people (for instance if it's state information for your app) you should write dates with the invariant culture. Example: string invariantDate = DateTime.Today.ToString(System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
A recursive function is one that calls itself. int RecursiveIncrement(int start, int target) { if(start &gt; target) throw new InvalidOperationException("Start must be smaller or equal to target"); if(start &lt; target) return RecursiveAdd(start + 1, target); return start; }
keep track of the last point in each mouse move and draw a line from the last point to the current point
This is a really bad implementation. Why always return an array when it's most of the time not even used? This is absolute unnecessary memory allocation.
Thanks, it's much better this way. Not perfect as you can see here: http://imgur.com/aGDyDmZ but with a small pen-thickness its working alright and is exactly what i needed. Thank you :)
It demonstrates recursion.
This is a simple recursive algorithm using the yield state machine. public IEnumerable&lt;part&gt; GetAllParts(part part) { if (part == null) yield break; yield return part; if (part.childParts == null) yield break; foreach (var p in GetAllParts(part.childPart)) { yield return p; } } public IEnumerable&lt;Part&gt; GetAllParts(params Part[] parts) { return parts.SelectMany(GetAllParts); }
Don't demonstrate with bad examples.
This returns too many parts.
Are you sure? I actually tested this and it works fine. Please provide a sample tree structure.
I tried it on mine. Does it return the original parent too? OP states all children.

Or, keep track of all the points while the mouse button is down and then draw a spline.
You are adding the parameter @userVersion twice. Comment out: cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@userVersion", ""); and you should be good. using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connString)) { conn.Open(); SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("getUserVersion", conn); cmd.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure; cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@u", Session["New"].ToString()); SqlParameter p1 = new SqlParameter("@userVersion", SqlDbType.NVarChar) { Direction = ParameterDirection.Output; Size = 10; } cmd.Parameters.Add(p1); cmd.ExecuteNonQuery(); string k = cmd.Parameters["@userVersion"].Value.ToString().Trim(); cmd.Dispose(); lbl_version.Text = k; } 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqlparameter.size(v=vs.110).aspx You need to specify the size of the output parameter when using a character type. &gt;If I remove the line.. Did you remember to put it back?
You could use the StreamReader class to import in the text file, then store the line into a string variable and split using .Split(' ') to separate where there is a space. You would store the spilt strings into an array of strings and go from there. I'm on mobile or I would link to the StreamReader class. There may be a better way but that is the way I'm aware of. StackOverflow is also a great resource for questions like this.
thanks yeah i searched stackoverflow, had no luck. Too lazy to make an account, saw this subreddit, others asked questions so ithought i could ask :) ill tell you in a bit if that works.

I was just surprised that it was short. Seems like there should be a lot more to read during a first year of CS. Do you know how the university of hull uses it? Do students read it at the beginning of the year and then use other books? Do they read it throughout the year supplemented by other materials? Going to download it now. 
No problem! Good luck, friend :)
Looks at author's name.... Looks away, hiding face with hand....
Simply, you shouldn't be drawing on one at all. Here's a post from the creator of Paint.NET on why and what he did: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11020710/is-graphics-drawimage-too-slow-for-bigger-images/11025428#11025428
I usually hate when people give advice that says, are you sure you want to do it this way instead of a different way? Is GTK# a requirement? (Of course I want to do it this way, why the hell would I be asking!, is what I usually think, so I understand reaction) However, gtk# is not supported at all any more. To be honest, it was never supported much at all at the time of it's most active development. It is riddled with bugs and inconsistencies, and the company that created isn't even around any more. (And Xamarin couldn't give a flying fuck about anything but mobile, their bread and butter.) Like I said, I hate to do this, but would it be possible for you to [embed a web browser](http://www.mono-project.com/WebBrowser) and show your video on that? Another idea would include rewriting just the bits you need in Qt, which is very active. tl;dr; I don't have the answer you're looking for, but there may be other options source: been using gtk# for years and froze anything but bug fixes on it years ago in my own company 
&gt; Is GTK# a requirement? Nope. However my project is a little deeper in development to make me resistant, but not immune, to switching frameworks. &gt; Qt This is going to sound dumb, but please remember that we all have to learn about a given thing somewhere... I've only heard of Qt today, about 3 hours ago. If you think Qt is a way to go, I'd be open to it. However there are requirements that I'd love to pick your brain on. 1. Can I mix and match it with Gtk/Gdk? If so, that would be best because I could keep most of my project intact. 2. Can Qt be used with .net/mono (specifically, C#)? I've seen lots on C++ but my research didn't pull up any bindings beyond Qt# (which became another framework, which became QtSharp) but are the bindings up to date? I would hate for Qt to be at 5.2 and QtSharp be at, for example, 3.0. 3. If it can't be mixed and matched with Gtk#, does it have either handles or can it take sockets? The idea is using mPlayer with the -slave -wid parameters to embed video. This is something I'm not to be flexible on. If I could, I'd try out lots of players.
I've found lots of answers on SO that basically say "you can't do that, don't try" and then gotten around it. Like transparent winforms without using the perpixelalpha form. SO is a great starting point but like Wikipedia you cannot use it as your sole resource.
This is done to eliminate a race condition between the null check and the call. In your second example, another thread could remove the last delegate from the PropertyChanged event after the null check, but before the delegate invocation, resulting in a null reference exception when you attempt to invoke. By making a copy (not instantiating a new instance!) of the PropertyChanged delegate, you guarantee that the state of the copy will be consistent throughout the rest of the method. See [this post](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2009/04/29/events-and-races.aspx) by Eric Lippert for more detail.
just tried it, unfortunately doesn't work or im not using it correctly sadly 
xamarin studio want to install an update to gtk# tonight... so....
Ahh then i get it, well i am sorry i am from Denmark, so have no idea how they use the book, can't even remember how i found it anymore :-) But i would be very surprised if this was the only book they used.
Depends on how you implement it. If you grab your canvas from the picture box on mousedown, you can draw all over a copy of it and paste it back as often as you like. Similar to a backbuffer. Then when the user is happy with the Payton and lets up on the mouse button, you draw a final copy to the picture box and start over.
[MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/db5x7c0d%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) using System; using System.IO; class Test { public static void Main() { try { using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader("TestFile.txt")) { String line = sr.ReadToEnd(); Console.WriteLine(line); } } catch (Exception e) { Console.WriteLine("The file could not be read:"); Console.WriteLine(e.Message); } } } This is how you would read a single line. Then you can use: string[] array = line.Split(' '); to get what you want. Access the array in the order of you columns to find specific values. Is that helpful? EDIT: Sorry for formatting, I do not know how to do a code block
Read Eric's post. It answers your questions in detail. In short, it doesn't actually introduce any new issues. This issues you think it introduces already exist! Second, because multicast delegates are immutable, it's actually the act of adding or removing a handler than has an (infinitesimal!!) overhead. Copying the reference doesn't incur any more overhead than copying an IntPtr. The new object is instantiated when you add or remove a handler, not when you copy the reference to the event delegate. Frankly, I think you are a little too worried about performance. If the idea of a single extra object instantiation per method call is a *legitimate* concern for you, you probably need to be writing this code in an unmanaged language. The reality is that it's extremely unlikely that it will ever be an issue.
yup thats helpful thanks :) 
Hello ima_coder: Thanks for the link, but I know how to use a tableadapter for the datasource. What I am asking is how to use a custom query in the QueriesTableAdapter. The following line of code fills my datagridview from the Northwind Employees Table ... Shift_RnkCts_dgv.DataSource = employeesTableAdapter.GetData(); But .. Shift_RnkCts_dgv.DataSource = QueriesTableAdapter.GetData(); Does NOT work, I'm not even allowed to Access the QueriesTableAdapter - let alone the custom query I built in the QueriesTableAdapter. I tried to build the custom query in the employeesTableAdapter, but the employeesTableAdapter will not allow me to build a crosstab query ---- hence my need to use the QueriesTableAdapter .... (sigh).... Anyone out there know how to fill a datagridview with results from a crosstab query???? Thanks in advance - Pavilion
&gt; In short, it doesn't actually introduce any new issues. This issues you think it introduces already exist! True, stale delegates may/do already exist--but this solution does exacerbate that issue, by potentially keeping a stale delegate around when it had requested to be removed. I understand that it could be done to resolve the potential null dereference on the EventHandler, though. My concern about performance penalty isn't necessarily that the code I'm writing is going to be *severely* impacted, but moreso that it's going to be called quite frequently (thanks in part to how INotifyPropertyChanged is implemented), and I want it to be as efficient as possible. Without understanding the *why* this was implemented, it looked like a wasted instantiation, copy, and eventually, GC operation. 
Could *you please clarify why Microsoft's example doesn't use the temp variable pattern? Is it only good practice in certain scenarios? private void NotifyPropertyChanged([CallerMemberName] String propertyName = "") { if (PropertyChanged != null) { PropertyChanged(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName)); } } http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.inotifypropertychanged(v=vs.110).aspx
No, Microsoft's code examples are just generally terrible. When you look at MSDN code samples, you should look *only* at what is actually being demonstrated, nothing else. In this case, they are demonstrating how to raise the PropertyChanged event, not how to correctly raise events in general, if that makes sense. Basically, that code snippet is showing off the `[CallerMemberName]` attribute, and the correct arguments to the `PropertyChangedEventArgs` constructor, and absolutely nothing else. My rule of thumb is to read MSDN for actual docs only. If I need to see code, I go looking on Stack Overflow, where people can at least comment if the code is wonky.
Understood. Thanks :-).
My understanding is if you override a method regardless of if you cast the object to it's parent objects type you will still get the overrided output of the method. If you hide it, when you cast to the parent objects type you will get it's method called instead of the original constructed class.
There wouldn't be a GC operation as the eventHandler variable would be allocated on the stack. 
Yes, but once NotifyPropertyChanged leaves scope, it would be deallocated, and hence a GC call--for each Property.
This is how I understand it. When *virtual* methods are overidden with *override*, the **instantiated type** (the value type) determines which method is called (aka polymorphism). When "non-virtual" methods are overidden with *new*, the **reference type** (the variable type) determines which method is called. ------------- *edit: attempted to clarify what I meant by instantiated type and reference type.*
I don't follow. Once OnPropertyChanged eventHandler will get popped off the stack. As /u/0xffff1 pointed out, the multicast delegate is immutable. So either the delegate doesn't change and nothing has to be garbage collected, or the delegate changes and the old version would have to be garbage collected anyway. Premature optimization is the root of all evil. 
[I feel this is highly relevant](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ssRUr.gif)
No... You're either misunderstanding how the GC works, or misunderstanding how the delegate works. The event raise method has absolutely no impact on the GC. Only adding or removing handlers creates new objects and pushes the old object out of scope. The line `var eventHandler = this.PropertyChanged;` only copies the reference to the object, not the object itself. If another thread does something that results in `eventHandler` being the only reference, then the delegate object will be GC'd at the end of the method, but it would have been GC'd anyway. Otherwise, no garbage collection occurs.
How are you telling mplayer to draw on your GdkWindow? Are you taking account of the [client-side windows](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk2/stable/gtk-migrating-ClientSideWindows.html) changes in GTK 2.18? Even though GTK# 2.x API is frozen at 2.12, it will normally be running on much later versions of GTK+, and you can P/Invoke through to newer API e.g. gdk_window_ensure_native.
This is why generally hiding a method is a bad idea. Hiding is really only useful if you don't have control of the base class to change the method to virtual. 
&gt;How are you telling mplayer to draw on your GdkWindow? So I have a Fixed container (called Parent) and I add onto it an EventBox (called Panel). I put a socket into Panel (simply called socket) and pass socket.id as a parameter to mplayer (which has the -slave switch and -wid socket.id switch). The videos play properly. I just cant put any other widget on top. I get the content to fill panels with from a local script that supplies JSON. Let's say you had two media items in that JSON: a video and an image, I go through the items with a foreach and create new panels, add them to parent, then fill them with content. In this example, placing a video first, then an image overtop (say, a logo in the corner) should result in the logo over the video. That doesn't happen. I think I found the reasoning: I can't have a transparent PNG. It needs the eventbox to have visiblewindow=false and visible=true, but this messes up layering. I'll have to find another way to get transparent images to work.

&gt; if you'd hidden it, you'd have gotten lost me there. 
I see. Under the hood, a reference type assigned to another reference type doesn't actually set aside memory for the entire object, but rather just a pointer that redirects to the other object. The GC would have to clean up the IntPtr, but overall, much less work than constructing and cleaning up a full MulticastDelegate object. Is that accurate?
And only if you can be absolutely certain that all calls to the signature of the hidden method will be made on an instance typed as the derived type doing the hiding. The base class scenario you describe is a sneaky and terribly unsafe one, in that if the method was interesting enough for you to want to override but you had to settle for a hide, the original version of the method is almost certainly being called by other interesting code you also don't control and cannot override and you won't get your intended behavior by doing a hide down in a derived type. In coding C# full-time since beta 2 I don't recall seeing a legit, appropriate usage of hiding in production code. Hiding is super dangerous.
You're getting there. The GC would not have to clean up the pointer though. The GC works on an object graph, not on individual bits of memory. So if you have a reference to an object in another object, that reference gets "cleaned up" when the owning object gets cleaned up. In this case, the reference is a local variable that doesn't belong to any object. That doesn't mean that the GC cleans it up directly though, it just means that it gets cleaned up at the end of the method. It's simply on the stack, so it gets "cleaned up" when the method's stack frame goes out of scope. It's quite a lot more complicated under the hood as far as exactly when things go out of scope, but the beauty of a managed language is that you don't have to worry about that. What isn't complicated is that the GC is absolutely not involved with this method whatsoever. Nothing this method does can possibly impact the GC except by keeping an already existing object alive a little longer than it would have been otherwise.
Which Qt .net binding would you recommend?
"tscrap.cs" egh
well, i stopped reading it right at the description. 
Makes sense and it's the first thing I'll try, but won't the eventbox have a unique Window id at that time, thus I'll run into the same issue? It also makes me want to try finding out if I can use the main Window id entirely. Edit: Didn't work. But once I took transparency off of the image widget, it draws ontop of mplayer correctly. I think I'm going to have to use Cairo in the event box to allow the image to be transparent.
The real shame is that they invented a keyword just to suppress a compiler warning, and that they suggest the keyword over fixing your design. The "new" keyword needs to go away, and if you truly want to ignore the warning, put a #pragma on it. But this shouldn't be the default suggestion.
Does this mean I'll finally be able to finish my voice controlled kicking plugin? Huzzah!
Additionally, assuming you're doing the whole Visual Studio thing, Votive (the WiX-VS integration) lets you add your other projects as references to your WiX projects, and therefore refer to their output via preprocessor variables. (see [here](http://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/votive/votive_project_references.html)).
Sometimes it's worthwhile. For example, I've created non-generic base classes classes, then generic-typed subclasses. The parts of the API that _know_ about the generic aspect can take advantage of it to be strongly typed while hiding the non-generic, non-compile-time safe interfacing methods. Meanwhile the other aspects of the API that don't know about (and don't care) about the derived classes being used can use the non-generic methods. Consider the following interfaces and services: public interface IFoo { } public class FooImpl : IFoo { } public class Service&lt;T&gt; : Service where T : IFoo { public new T MyFoo { get; private set; } public Service(T foo) : base(foo) { this.MyFoo = foo; } } public abstract class Service { public IFoo MyFoo { get; private set; } internal Service(IFoo foo) { this.MyFoo = foo; } } And say you have some utility or managed code that doesn't care about the implementations of `IFoo`: public static class SomeUtility { public static void DoSomething(Service service) { IFoo baseFoo = service.MyFoo; //typed as base IFoo } } Then your usage code where the implementation of `IFoo` is known, and used can be strongly typed against `FooImpl` but still use any of the managed utilities: Service&lt;FooImpl&gt; service = new Service&lt;FooImpl&gt;(new FooImpl()); FooImpl theFoo = service.MyFoo; //strongly typed as FooImpl SomeUtility.DoSomething(service); //will be used as IFoo Also note, that you can treat warnings as errors in your build settings. Regardless, the information is there, and it's up to you as a developer to know _what_ hiding is and how to _effectively_ use it. The `new` keyword has its uses and it's up to us as developers to use the tool _properly_ and not _abuse/misuse_ it.
lol
So in my research, it turns out only one binding is still in use: https://github.com/ddobrev/QtSharp There used to be Qt#, and then it became Qyoto, which itself became QtSharp. Qyoto is recommended on the Mono homepage for GUI frameworks. There is also qt4dotnet (https://code.google.com/p/qt4dotnet/) but their last change was in 2010. 
Then here's a really good advice: Keep your code clean as you write it, not afterwards. Especially before you check it in into your repository.
Hey thanks for all the help! The regular expression method really saved my butt. I was wondering though if I could add multiple strings to look for at the same time? I tried using this: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/254847d767904f834460 I dont know if this will work, but I am getting an error from: "DATE AND TIME"|"RSSI" It says: Error 1 Operator '|' cannot be applied to operands of type 'string' and 'string' Thanks! 
However, that behavior works the same whether you use `new` or not - all `new` does is suppress the compiler warning. See [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/435f1dw2.aspx) and [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173153.aspx) - the behavior of the app with and without the `new` is exactly the same, except for the warning.
I suppose the C# language designers decided to use this keyword as a quality-of-life feature of C#; it can be useful when 3rd parties change their libraries. It helps to avoid breaking your API simply because a 3rd party adds a member which _happens_ to match one of yours but in all other aspects is completely unrelated except in name only. This was _especially_ important when generics were added in C#2. Eric Lippert does a great job of discussing the _why_ hiding was introduced with `new` here: http://stackoverflow.com/q/3117838/1269654. I guess the C# language designers felt that using `new` as a modifier keyword as opposed to a #pragma I guess as it would be that much more simpler and hiding, in general, has enough valid use-case scenarios to warrant first-class usage in the language. To be clear, yes, behaviour of the application with or without `new` is exactly the same. Method hiding was _always there_. But inclusion of `new` was felt as a quality-of-life improvement for developers. And this isn't exclusive just to `new`: for example, we can exclude access modifiers. Including or excluding `private` on a field doesn't change _anything_, and the C# language designers _could_ have required it to be always explicitly declared, but they felt there was good enough reason to have access modifiers optional.
Unfortunately, the example code you posted is even more dangerous than the usual uses of hiding public method signatures. You have two MyFoos, one used by the base class code and one by the derived class code, and this is almost assuredly not what you intended. Your derived class code will be closer to working once it loses its MyFoo auto-property entirely and includes at least one instance of "((T)MyFoo)".
This was example was a bit contrived, but the class design is _completely safe and intentional and working._ Both MyFoo references are immutable; they are both pointing to the same object. I _could_ have performed casting with the property getter, but it's bit of a performance overhead each time the property is accessed even though the class design _guarantees_ it's of the matching type. EDIT: Just for clarity, you were suggesting I have this instead: public class Service&lt;T&gt; : Service where T : IFoo { public new T MyFoo { get { return (T)base.MyFoo; } } public Service(T foo) : base(foo) { } } This requires additional unnecessary casting. (I would definitely suggest this if the base class is mutable, but then I wouldn't be using hiding in this usage, or at least any mutation would be type-checked at runtime.) Perhaps a better way of understanding my intended immutability is through this implementation: public class Service&lt;T&gt; : Service where T : IFoo { private readonly T _TypedMyFoo; public new T MyFoo { get { return _TypedMyFoo; } } public Service(T foo) : base(foo) { this._TypedMyFoo = foo; } } public abstract class Service { private readonly IFoo _UntypedMyFoo; public IFoo MyFoo { get { return _UntypedMyFoo; } } internal Service(IFoo foo) { this._UntypedMyFoo = foo; } } I had thought about it, but thought it was slightly irrelevant to the discussion as I had already implemented immutability in the class implementation I posted.
Sorry, I'm not sure if I understand; perhaps you posted this before I posted my edits above with example code. The _intent_ is that any code working with a typed `Service&lt;T&gt;` can _only_ work with a strongly typed `T`. The code working with a weakly typed `Service` can only work with a weakly typed `IFoo`. Derived and base classes can add as many fields as they wish. EDIT: Sorry, again, I don't understand your edited second paragraph. Can you maybe post an example usage of my posted class design that introduces undesired behaviour?
Another quick one, this time from my phone while I walk the dog. ;) In your comment you mentioned wanting to allow non-generic clients and generic clients to each have their appropriate level of typed access to MyFoo. My responses have been more focused on behavior in the base service class and derived service class themselves, as these are the kinds of situations that mess things up as code evolves in all but the most trivial systems. But even your use case would not work as you describe it. Instances of the derived type have two MyFoo properties: one seen by code referencing the base type, the other seen by code referencing the derived type. And even when considering just one single instance of the derived type, which of the two properties you access depends entirely upon _the type referenced by the caller_. That said, your pattern is not uncommon and there is a fix. It might be hard to describe on my phone, but I'll try. :-) In your derived service type, change from an auto property to an actual property declaration. Instead of having a backing field for the property, reference the base type MyFoo property, casting appropriately. The downside here is that accesses are going to be casting back-and-forth over and over, but that's the cost of doing business if you want this kind of set up. This can prove particularly annoying when you expect that the majority of accesses are going to come from generic types referencing the derived service class, with less accesses going through the absolute base service class. This whole discussion brings up in a roundabout way some common issues with inheritance, and reminds me most of how this kind of code tends to bump into the Fragile Base Class Problem. Probably a subject best saved for another time, though, perhaps. :-) EDIT: I accidentally a few words, and a few other tidy-ups.
They're all the "instructions" in the IL assembly generated from your code. Basically, it's method calls. For some clarity, when the CLR loads up an assembly, it puts all the method calls (along with other stuff) into a method table in memory. For more (deeper, but maybe a little outdated) info, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163791.aspx#S8
Yup yup. Thanks for the reminder about your constructor setup and the immutability aspect, as those definitely close off the primary bug vectors. ;) For the record, I am a huge fan of immutability and, more specific to this discussion, Correct Upon Construction. I am surprised that I glazed over your those parts of your setup. Apologies there. I guess I am just so used to seeing this kind of thing put in place and then go wrong over time that I over-focused on that side of things. I think you and I are pretty much on the same page here, on the whole.
whatever, how can I take it seriously, if it contains 'tscrap.cs' for example?
For a second, I thought I finally had a term for this concept ("Correct Upon Construction") but sadly it doesn't exist... _yet_. I think I'm in the same boat as you; seen several mistakes like you pointed out (I may have at one point done the same... :D) and come around to this Correct Upon Construction concept and highly favouring immutability. It becomes very easy to immediately notice things like 2 fields being used when only 1 object is being wrapped. The more and more I rewrite my old code to be immutable or functional, the more and more I appreciate it. Thanks for the discussion!
I'm a old assembly programmer that now uses c#, and to test for even/ odd int I would just test the lowest bit.. But it gets me thinking of how you would test for even / odd without using bit operations..
Definitely a fun chat. Thanks for bearing with my glazing over of your ctor setup. Your example bears the cost of an extra reference, true, but since the service instance count is likely to be tiny in the grand scheme of things it would probably work out nicely relative to the casting cost of the alternative. I like it! EDIT: funny that you mention the term not existing yet. I'm sure I got it from somewhere, rather than coining it myself. Perhaps I'll have to do some digging some time to see if I can rediscover the source. EDIT EDIT: I haven't found the source, but do recall it being a riff on http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CorrectByConstruction which, instead of describing how an entire system can be made and guaranteed correct, focuses on the construction of a single object and how the object should be essentially guaranteed to be fully usable by the time it finishes being constructed. I seem to remember it coming up at times in the context of DI, specifically with respect to the risks of property and setter injection in comparison to constructor injection. I'm sure the concept kicks around under a number of names, and I'd be happy to run with a more common one if someone were to bump into it or know it off-hand and reply with a pointer to it.
Kudos :)
You'd use mod operator which returns remainder. (x % 2 == 0) would be an even number because dividing by 2 has no remainder. But your response is equally valid. You can do this in ASM too: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8231882/how-to-implement-the-mod-operator-in-assembly 
As someone completely new to csharp and pretty new to programming in general, what is the superior alternative?
Take a look at WPF. In the beginning a higher learning curve, but in the long run only benefits. Completely restyleable elements, fluent (resizing) interfaces, better seperation of view and logic (MVVM pattern).
Okay, I'm going to assume I don't need to know much about this, but just to clarify... do these instructions live on the stack or the heap, or is it more complex than that?
Instructions as /u/gregbair explained are a different thing from stack/heap space. Stack/Heaps are used to store variables and their associated objects for a running program. A running programs instructions are executed outside of the memory space that that program is assigned when it starts. I read through all 5 of those articles and did'nt see him enumerate on instructions. If you want to know more about MSIL here is a good place to start : http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k5532s8a%28v=vs.110%29.aspx
Thanks! I appreciate the answer!
My favorite: the yield operator. It causes the compiler to create a little state machine for you. For instance: static IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; GenerateFibonacci(int max) { int a = 0; int b = 1; while (a &lt; max) { int temp = a; a = b; b += temp; if (a &lt; max) { yield return a; } } } Is turned into something like this by the compiler: private sealed class &lt;GenerateFibonacci&gt;d__0 : IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; { private int &lt;&gt;1__state; private int &lt;&gt;2__current; public int &lt;&gt;3__max; private int &lt;&gt;l__initialThreadId; public int &lt;a&gt;5__1; public int &lt;b&gt;5__2; public int &lt;temp&gt;5__3; public int max; public &lt;GenerateFibonacci&gt;d__0(int &lt;&gt;1__state) { this.&lt;&gt;1__state = &lt;&gt;1__state; this.&lt;&gt;l__initialThreadId = Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId; } private bool MoveNext() { switch (this.&lt;&gt;1__state) { case 0: this.&lt;&gt;1__state = -1; this.&lt;a&gt;5__1 = 0; this.&lt;b&gt;5__2 = 1; break; case 1: this.&lt;&gt;1__state = -1; break; default: goto Label_0091; } while (this.&lt;a&gt;5__1 &lt; this.max) { this.&lt;temp&gt;5__3 = this.&lt;a&gt;5__1; this.&lt;a&gt;5__1 = this.&lt;b&gt;5__2; this.&lt;b&gt;5__2 += this.&lt;temp&gt;5__3; if (this.&lt;a&gt;5__1 &lt; this.max) { this.&lt;&gt;2__current = this.&lt;a&gt;5__1; this.&lt;&gt;1__state = 1; return true; } } Label_0091: return false; } [DebuggerHidden] IEnumerator&lt;int&gt; IEnumerable&lt;int&gt;.GetEnumerator() { Program.&lt;GenerateFibonacci&gt;d__0 d__; if ((Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId == this.&lt;&gt;l__initialThreadId) &amp;&amp; (this.&lt;&gt;1__state == -2)) { this.&lt;&gt;1__state = 0; d__ = this; } else { d__ = new Program.&lt;GenerateFibonacci&gt;d__0(0); } d__.max = this.&lt;&gt;3__max; return d__; } void IEnumerator.Reset() { throw new NotSupportedException(); } int IEnumerator&lt;int&gt;.Current { get { return this.&lt;&gt;2__current; } } } 
Yup. await does something similar for awaitables.
Wow. I can't believe I forgot that one. It's actually my favorite, too! I wish it had support for sending values like Python does (`var inp = yield return "output";`), but given that C# is statically typed, the opportunities there are limited.
the comma was throwing me off - there are 3 commas in there so I thought it needed 3 types. Since T is generic, it just means the comma isn't necessary? Could I have written &lt;T, t, MyRequestHeader, R&gt; as well?
also could I ask you SomeFunction&lt;T&gt;(Action&lt;T, MyRequestHeader&gt; op) what does Action do exactly just merge two things together?
I'm not sure which part you're talking about. In `R someMethod(T t, MyRequestHeader header)`, the `t` is just a parameter name to make that snippet a valid method signature. `Func&lt;T, MyRequestHeader, R&gt;` has three generic types because it has one extra type for the return type. Whenever you see `Func&lt;T1, ..., TN&gt;`, the first `n - 1` generic types are parameter types, and the n^th type is the return type.
thanks this was really helpful! Would you say I absolutely would have to pass some lambda expression to the function SomeFunction? I couldn't invoke it any other way. even something simple like: public string Test&lt;T&gt;(Action&lt;string, string&gt; r) { string s = "hello"; return s; } complained that I couldn't invoke it and only something like this worked: Test&lt;int&gt;( (a,b) =&gt; return a) so does it always have to have a lambda?
Exactly.
This should be a good starting point to see how everything works: internal class Program { public static void Main(string[] args) { Action&lt;int&gt; intAction = WriteInt; // Works fine. Action&lt;int&gt; intAction2 = WriteString; // Compiler error, the parameter type doesn't match Action&lt;string&gt; strAction = WriteString; // Works Action&lt;string&gt; strAction2 = WriteInt; // Same as above intAction(1); // outputs 1 to the console strAction("Hello World"); // outputs "Hello World" to the console. Func&lt;int, int&gt; echoIntFunc = EchoInt; Func&lt;int, int&gt; iechoIntFunc2 = IntToString; // Error, return types don't match Func&lt;int, string&gt; i2sFunc = IntToString; Func&lt;string, string&gt; i2sFunc2 = IntToString; // Error, param types don't match int echo = echoIntFunc(2); // echo == 2 string i2s = i2sFunc(2); // i2s == "2" } private static void WriteInt(int i) { Console.WriteLine(i); } private static void WriteString(string s) { Console.WriteLine(s); } private static int EchoInt(int i) { return i; } private static string IntToString(int i) { return i.ToString(); } }
OK - I'm getting closer, or at least I've moved further along in my script before getting an error. Following is my script as it currently stands: _____________________ OleDbConnection conn = new OleDbConnection(); conn.ConnectionString = "Provider=VFPOLEDB.1;Data Source=C:\\Folder1\\Folder2\\FoxSample.Dbf"; conn.Open(); System.Data.OleDb.OleDbCommand oCmd = conn.CreateCommand(); oCmd.CommandText = @"SELECT * FROM C:\\Folder1\\Folder2\\FoxSample.Dbf"; DataTable dt = new DataTable(); dt.Load(oCmd.ExecuteReader()); conn.Close(); ____________________________ The exception is thrown at the following line: dt.Load(oCmd.ExecuteReader()); And the error message is ..... Command contains unrecognized phrase/keyword. Once again, any advice is welcome: Thanks in advance - Pavilion
What I was going to write is at the bottom, the real problem is that instead of selecting from a table in your Foxpro database, you're trying to run SQL against the database file (SELECT * FROM C:\\.....FoxSample.Dbf). Open up your Foxpro database, run the sql you want to run there and then copy back to form the select command in your CommandText. I'm guessing you're now codeblind from working on the same stuff for too long. I had to give it a break this week. Use the [watch window in VS2010](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/8dc96462-092e-4c1c-97a5-cf622a24317d/how-to-add-watch-window-in-visual-studio-2010?forum=sqlxml) or set a break at the line after oCmd.CommandText and look at what the value of CommandText is. See if the value works running directly against the database.
It's not that error. It's different. The extension I tried to install though is cocos2D-xna empty game for android. I just installed another template that actually works though
Some times we forget to human.
Why don't you try it and see?
Actually I got into a new project so allocation of softwares will take some time...that why 
Install VS on your own system?
You can create extension methods with the same signature as an existing method. However, the existing method will **always** be preferred to your extension method. Example LINQPad Script: void Main() { int i = 0; i.ToString().Dump(); } static class Extensions { public static string ToString(this int obj) { return "Hello"; } } This compiles and runs fine, but the output will be **0**. You can still call your extension method explicitly: Extensions.ToString(i).Dump(); // Will return "Hello"
I think the generic type parameter should be named similar to it's restrictions (type constraints) and it's reason. For example if every type works for the generic type, it's fine to use T. For results it's nice to use TResult.
I don't understand this example, can you please elaborate? Essentially it seems like `AsEnumerable()` to me.
Oh ok thanks. So is it anyway related to overloading or both methods will be treated as separate methods. (I am assuming that my ToString extension method accepts an integer)
Extension methods are never treated as overloading. They are always distinct methods, just with a bit of syntax sugar.
What is Dump()
The ToString method in *i.ToString()* refers to the **instance** method that is defined in the Object type (the base class for all types). Extension methods are always **static** methods so this means that the **extension** method cannot be considered an overload of the **instance** method.
Hello lollipopklan - Thanks for jumping in here... You're right, this situation is causing code blindness and I am PC Fried. But - it's something I have to stay on and try to figure out. You make an excellent point. I wish I could go back to the FoxPro database and run the sql there, but that isn't a possibility. I've got a test dbf file on my own system, and even if I could run this exercise on my client's system, the FoxPro database in question is proprietary and running sql in it just isn't an option. Your point though is valid, I'll have to try and come at it from this end though. Thanks - Pavilion
LINQPad is a very nice (and free) tool to run C# snippets. It's basically a C# scratch pad with great functionality. You can check it out here: www.linqpad.net Within the LINQPad scripts you're running you can call `.Dump()` on any object, which will print out the object in the associated LINQPad output window. It will also return the object, so you can use it for fluent debug output: myCollection.Dump().Where(condition).Dump().Where(condition2).Dump(); This will print out the content of the collection before the first `Where()`, after the first `Where()` and after the second `Where()`.
Like AngularBeginner mentioned, every single call to childrenSoFar.ToArray() is a new memory allocation and is not even used until the entire tree has been traversed. A different approach would be to populate a single list that gets passed to each recursive call and return void. void Main() { part parent = new part(); // Read about collection initializers if you are not familiar with the syntax // http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb384062.aspx parent.childparts = new part[] { new part(), new part() }; parent.childparts[0].childparts = new part[] { new part(), new part(), new part() }; List&lt;part&gt; allParts = new List&lt;part&gt;(); GetAllChildren(parent, allParts); //If you must have an array part[] allPartsArray = allParts.ToArray(); Console.WriteLine("There are {0} children", allParts.Length); } private void GetAllChildren(part parent, List&lt;part&gt; allParts) { if(parent.childparts != null) { foreach (part childPart in parent.childparts) { allParts.Add(childPart); GetAllChildren(childPart, allParts); } } } class part { public part[] childparts; }
I'd assumed something like that. I'd used LINQPad when it first came out but not since. Thanx for the info.
You should check it out again. :-)
This is a very primitive implementation of Dump, yes. The LINQPad one is a lot more complex (and only suited for use within LINQPad).
Oh yes exactly. Stupid of me to miss out on that point. Thanks a lot for clarity :)
Pavilion, are you seeing the point Lollipopklan made about how your SQL statement is incorrect? Your statement, rather than saying "SELECT * FROM PERSONNEL" (I made up the table name "PERSONNEL") is saying "SELECT * FROM FoxSample.Dbf". FoxSample.Dbf is a database file name and shouldn't be in a sql statement. I've never worked with FoxPro before so I don't know if it has an equivalent to information_schema (SQL Server) or dba_tables (Oracle) which are tables that tell you about the tables and other objects in your database. But if you have no information about what tables are in the database, you can still use GetSchema() (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.common.dbconnection.getschema(v=vs.110).aspx) to access that information. I think it would be oCmd.GetSchema() in your case.
It's fairly common in recursive methods that you have some kind of exit strategy. That's why I shoehorned in the return statement at the top.
Well - I finally figured it out. Following is my final block of code - in case someone else is having the same problem. This is a test block with Northwind dbfs, but it works great on my regular FoxPro file as well ___________________________ string Path = "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual FoxPro OLE DB Provider\\Samples\\Northwind"; OleDbConnection conn = new OleDbConnection(@"Provider=vfpoledb;Data Source=" + Path + ";Collating Sequence=machine;"); conn.Open(); System.Data.OleDb.OleDbCommand oCmd = conn.CreateCommand(); OleDbCommand command = new OleDbCommand("select employeeid, lastname, firstname, title, birthdate, hiredate as Hired, address, city, region as state, postalcode as zip, homephone, extension from employees", conn); DataTable dt = new DataTable(); dt.Load(command.ExecuteReader()); conn.Close(); DBF_Employees_dgv.DataSource = dt; _____________________________________________________ Now for a few notes. 1. On running a SELECT against a FoxPro file I found out the following: // http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa337084.aspx // When working with DBF files, the folder represents the database, and the individual DBF files represent tables. Therefore the Database file name text box must contain the path of the folder where the DBF file resides, and must not include the file name itself. 2. The whole 32bit vs 64 bit thing was a huge problem. I had to download dedicated 32 bit drivers. But that's the gist of what has to be done to get to 32bit data in a dbf file. Pavilion
I did hear about resharper, is it expensive?
[$150 for a personal license](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/buy/index.jsp).
As a student you can get the academic license for $49. A full feature list you can find here: http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/index.html It is quite much, and alone the navigation and search features saved me many hours already.
Take a look at SharpDevelop. It's not nearly as good as Visual Studio, but it's not bad, quite feature complete and Open source. 
You should probably stay away from the designer to be honest, but SharpDevelop is really the only other alternative. 
Thanks! I'll take a look at that!
For me, I took out some books from my local library, some of the stuff was outdated but for the most part I really took away a lot of awesome content. I'm now in college learning programming in c# and c++
I'd recommend solving some problems posted at /r/dailyprogrammer. Use different algorithms and your own data structures to do them. Use different types of applications to do them as well, like ASP .NET or a Windows Forms Application. 
Yea i have thought of doing that, but i can't think of anything. You dont happen to have a suggestion for a project?
I always make a calculator when trying out a new language, or a battleships game. What do you want to concentrate on? database, classes/objects, gui, graphics, web?
Absolutely worth the price, I (personally) don't feel Visual Studio is complete without it now.
Well the study i will be attending, has database on the program so something with a database could be useful, but i think i will start with a calculator, then move to a battleship game. 
I've been there... Don't even bother with SharpDevelop. Visual Studio Express 2013 for C# is free - why not go for that? The only reason not to use VS 2013 is because you are developing on a different platform, like Linux or Mac, in which case take a look at MonoDevelop.
A designer for what? Web applications? WinForm? WPF? 
WinForms
type/symbol/file lookup feature (control-t) alone is worth $150. highly recommend ReSharper and spending a few weeks figuring out all the functionality.
I've been mis-associating the GC with the Stack, which is part of the confusion. If we have a reference type, String: String str; And we assign it a value: str = new String("Hey!"); str is a .NET object (containing, presumably, an IntPtr that points to the new String object containing "Hey!" on the Heap), correct? And, presumably, str is on the Stack (although this isn't always the case; the CLR does as it pleases with regard to the Stack vs. the Heap.) Typically, we would expect the GC to clean up memory that has no more references in the Heap, and seeing as str is on the Stack, we expect it to be popped off when the function leaves scope. There is still some cost in assigning str and placing it on the Stack, as it's an object and not a primitive, but it's relatively small (your original point) and the GC would not be cleaning it up (as it's hypothetically managed by the stack.) Everything correct so far? I want to understand that str is a .NET object, even if it doesn't correspond to a String object, in that the way .NET manages it as an object and not as a primitive.
I liked resharper but it seemed to slow everything way down so I ditched it. It took me a little while to get used to not having it but I like having everything running quickly
&gt;There is still some cost in assigning str and placing it on the Stack, as it's an object and not a primitive, but it's relatively small (your original point) and the GC would not be cleaning it up (as it's hypothetically managed by the stack.) This is the only thing I'm not quite sure I agree with. `str` itself is in fact something very like a primitive. It really nothing more than an integer value used to identify a particular object in memory. So there is a cost to allocating `str`, but it shouldn't be any greater than the cost of allocating a `int` or a `float`.
Just a reminder that (depending on scale) it's perfectly reasonable to write your own installer.
Well, there is an initialization cost, but that initialization cost is incurred by the constructor. Just copying a reference from one place to another doesn't incur any overhead. For Example: // This costs nothing, because we're basically just initialing to 0 str s1 = null; // This costs a lot because we have to call the string constructor s1 = new String("Hey"); // This costs nothing as well, since no object is created s2 = s1; Of course "nothing" in the above isn't actually nothing, but it really should have absolutely no more overhead than assigning a primitive.
If that is the case, there really is no better alternative than Visual Studio.
Microsoft spent years telling FoxPro and other users to forget ODBC and use OLEDB instead. The FoxPro OLEDB provider for Visual Studio work well. I'm no expert, but I've used it in one app - now in daily use - without problems. Alas, by the time Microsoft told developers to forget OLEDB and go back to ODBC, FoxPro was already out of production. So the old FoxPro ODBC driver only works on 32-bit Windows. You'd need to get a 3rd party driver for 64-bit. I can check with a software vendor who is about to install such a thing on one of our servers for details. Personally I went a different route. I needed an ASP.Net web services to get at FoxPro data Initially with FoxPro 7 or 8 I used SOAP web services created with just FoxPro. (For more details look at "XML Web Services" in FoxPro's Task Pane.) However I found installing them on the server to be unreliable. This turned out to be a bug in FoxPro, fixed not long after. But by then I switched to a different method. I compile FoxPro classes as multi-threaded com server DLLs and register them on the server. Then I can call on them from Visual Studio and any forms and ASP.NET web services I create, without need for ODBC or OLEDB. Most business intelligence - calculating prices etc. - is lifted from the original FoxPro apps and stays in the FoxPro DLLs. The ASP.NET web site is little more than a front end. I have the DLLs working on Server 2003, Server 2008, Server 2008r2 64-bit and Server 2012 64-bit. 
Your answer is in the proposed solutions: 1) Code duplication is a bad overall idea. If two objects share the same methods, why do the work twice? 2) Disabling methods for male class in itself is extra work because now you have to add additional code to handle this functionality, which in itself can be bugged. 
Alternatively, you can read through the code bases for some existing projects and see how they are doing things. You can also practice doing coding katas such as http://codingkata.net/ or by solving the Project Euler problems (https://projecteuler.net/problems). /u/jack104's suggestion of solving the problems from /r/dailyprogrammer is also a good option.
Put an SSD on your dev system. Believe me, the best investment you will do. They're around 80usd for 120gb models. 
It depends entirely on what his actual arguments are. It doesn't really matter that he thinks you should have one class or two; it matters *why* he thinks either approach is better than inheritance.
On the subject of 2, you've also potentially moved a compile time check to a runtime error, which is a big code smell in my book.
True enough (I thought you meant my proposed reasoning). I don't think disabling any functionality is the right answer (hence, we have inheritance for shared base functionality followed by unique functionality on the inheriting class)... BLeh! I worked for a company that did something similar. You had to wrap any calls to the function in a try/catch block because of it. Sloppy coding. Then they wouldn't let anyone access to the core library because they felt we might "code it wrong"... Bunch of scripters if I ever saw them. :D lol...
OK - but how do you do CSS in C# Visual 2010 Express? I've used CSS with html/Javascript/php, but never with C#. * Can you even use CSS with C# **(winform application)**??? * And if so, do you develop an independent CSS file? * And if you use an independent CSS file - how do you "include" the file in your .cs file? Scratching my head... and off to do some research Thanks in advance: Pavilion
Have you looked at: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.datagridview.borderstyle(v=vs.110).aspx 
Only use it where necessary. [Composition over inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance)
Well [inheriting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_tax) may come with certain taxes or levies paid by the person who inherits. Have you considered the possibility that your father may be right? ^I'll^see^myself^out
&gt;The DataGridView control allows you to fully customize its appearance, including the borders of the cells and headers. The DataGridView has CellBorderStyle, ColumnHeadersBorderStyle, and RowHeadersBorderStyle properties that allow you to set the appearance of the cell border. However, if you need to further customize the borders, the DataGridViewAdvancedBorderStyle class allows you to set the style of the border on the individual sides of the cells. The Left, Right, Top, and Bottom properties of DataGridViewAdvancedBorderStyle represent the left, right, top, and bottom border of a cell, respectively. You can set these properties on the AdvancedCellBorderStyle, AdvancedColumnHeadersBorderStyle, AdvancedRowHeadersBorderStyle properties of the DataGridView to produce various appearances for the borders between the cells. **TL;DR;** I think you're looking for **DataGridViewAdvancedBorderStyle** Source: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.datagridviewadvancedborderstyle(v=vs.110).aspx here are your options: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.datagridviewadvancedcellborderstyle(v=vs.110).aspx Edit- who puts parenthesis in their links????

As others have said, it depends. I look at it as follows: If you're trying to stop the duplication of fields/properties, inheritance from a class may be appropriate. However, if you're trying to avoid duplication of functions, you may wish to inherit from an interface. The decorator pattern is a good pattern in the right circumstances that takes the best of both inheritance and composition: [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern) I'd also ask, are there other types of humans rather than male and female? It sounds like you may want to inherit from an IHuman interface, instead, with the basic behaviors you'd like each to implement. Then, each could implement those as needed and would allow for greater extensibility, not to mention testability.
#####&amp;#009; ######&amp;#009; ####&amp;#009; [**Decorator pattern**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator%20pattern): [](#sfw) --- &gt; &gt;In [object-oriented programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), the **decorator pattern** (also known as Wrapper, an alternative naming shared with the [Adapter pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern)) is a [design pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_(computer_science\)) that allows behavior to be added to an individual [object](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science\)), either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same [class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_science\)). &gt;==== &gt;[**Image**](http://i.imgur.com/S4O0t7I.png) [^(i)](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Decorator_UML_class_diagram.svg) --- ^Interesting: [^Adapter ^pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern) ^| [^Python ^syntax ^and ^semantics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_syntax_and_semantics) ^| [^Object-oriented ^programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) *^\/u/qstnmrk ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cfeznal) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cfeznal)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less.* ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/) ^| [^flag ^a ^glitch](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/autowikibot&amp;subject=Glitched comment report&amp;message=What seems wrong: (optional description goes here\)%0A%0A---%0A%0AReply no. 56420:%0Ahttp://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/1xufz8/how_do_i_convince_my_dad_that_inheritance_is_a/cfezmz8)
Honestly I think at this point were really just nitpicking as the provided criteria does not tell us nearly enough to discuss if inheritance or composition is the better solution. No reasonable argument could be made so lets not waste time. Furthermore the OP's father's suggestions are not composition, rendering this whole segway of discussion even more irrelevant to the issue at hand. What the first proposed solution involving male and female being separate first violates is [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself). Secondly, looking at possible use cases, if you do not have the common parent class, you wouldn't be able to use typed array's or lists. This makes manipulation of the data much more difficult and prone to bugs or mistakes. If you can type you data structures as &lt;Human&gt; you are going to have a much easier time working with the data. The obvious solution that still isn't inheritance would be your fathers second solution, disabling methods for different genders. The problem with this is you are taking compile time errors and turning them into runtime errors. What if you want to have a traditional, god fearing, American family. With your fathers proposed method you could end up marrying two men, then only at run time will you get an error when Jane cannot use the haveBaby() method because Jane is actually a Joe. That would be the really low hanging fruit for criticisms for his/her father's design suggestions.
this was the biggest revelation to me learning OOP. it is amazing how much you can do with composition and interfaces, with hierarchies of inheritance only a few layers deep and no other design patterns.
Are you able to instantiate the human class? Because it shouldn't be possible, after all you can't have humans, just males or females. Do you also have an animal class and a mammal class? It would probably be easier to just have a human class that gets it's gender in the constructor and have reproduce only work for the female. Often it is better to not use inheritance as it is not necessary. 
I guess I'd argue it this way: Understanding: In this case, inheritance is a way to factor out common parts of two things into a shared third. It's analogous to a Venn Diagram (with the middle part representing the code in the base class). Conceptually, it's not much more than this. And, like a Venn Diagram, it's just one of many accepted ways to model the same information. Appreciating: Inheritance scales better than the two techniques your dad describes. Duplicating functions gets messy when where are more than a few functions involved, or when there are many (tens or hundreds) of derived classes instead of just the two (Male and Female) in your example. Disabling functions also gets messy when there are many derived classes around. Each method needs its own whitelist or blacklist of states that let it know when it should be enabled vs disabled. It's perhaps making the discussion more difficult because you're arguing about a case that scales minimally in those directions (1 base class, 2 derived classes, and more derived classes are unlikely to be added later). Discussing how you would model a larger and more dynamic domain, like [biological classification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification), will make it easier to see the failings of both the function-duplication and function-disabling techniques. 
&gt; Secondly, looking at possible use cases, if you do not have the common parent class, you wouldn't be able to use typed array's or lists. Not at all. You can still define appropriate interfaces to overcome this obstacle.
Trying to model reality under OOO paradigms is generally the wrong way to do it. The animal/cat/dog/bark/meow examples they use in most schools area *really, really bad*.
Hopefully your system doesn't crash the first time HR tries to register a hermaphrodite or trans-gender person.
Fair enough, I should have been clear that I only side with Dad in the sense that Male/Female subclasses of Human are probably the wrong approach. So are both of Dad's proposed alternatives. I'm not too keen on the one I suggested, either. Maybe at some level it's intuitive that a FemaleHuman should inherit from Human (or Mammal? Organism? Substance?) and expose a ConstructBaby() method because that's a familiar model from life. But I'll speculate that there is hardly a relation between human birth and the data this program is actually handling. The class hierarchy and ontology should promote the goal of *effectively manipulating the data*, not just modeling the world for the sake of it. That could imply odd things like a BabyBuilder, or never working with more than a small piece of a Human at a time (negating the value of having a Human class at all -- which really sounds like a candidate for a God-class, anyway). 
The impersonal "you". You could say "one has potentially moved" but that's more effort. English gets screwed sometimes by overloading the word "you" with too many features.
&gt;(multiple inheritance could help in some ways, but it ends up causing even worse nightmares than single inheritance **in C++**). FTFY. CLOS does multiple inheritance just fine. It's only C++ with it's overly explicit control that leads to things like diamond problem and so on.
an. A person who inherits from you is pronounced "air" not "hair".
Hopefully no one is writing production software that is modeling "Human", "Man", "Woman" and so on. If needed at all, it's just an attribute.
Is there really a country where this is a requirement compared to "has mostly male sex organs" or "has mostly female sex organs"?
HeySeussCristo: Thank you for the links. They look promising, but I'm about 40 hours into exploring C# 2010 Express - so these classes are still quite new to me. I did some initial testing, and can see the overall concept, but really don't have any idea how to apply to my "real world" form and datagridview. I'm going to have to do some playing around with the code... But thank you - at least I've got a good lead. Pavilion
Wait, he's advocating repetition? DRY has been best practice for decades!
shit, good call. 
"Hmmm, ok, yeah, about half way through, let me see who answered and if it's relevant." *Scrolls down* "Oh, yeah, I should probably read this." EDIT: Nevermind, separation of duties. Nice to see him comment about the extension of it though, anyone know of places where extending a built-in class will cause performance degradation in the base? Seems like it would just...act the same.
Again, this is not a discussion of composition vs inheritance ; it is the op vs his/her fathers design suggestions.
Are you referring to me? I was asking for examples like the SO OP linked to. It seemed off to me as well which is why I was looking for community input.
It's more of a database than an OOP issue, really. But garbage in, garbage out. If you have someone who doesn't convenient fit into M/F and your system only has selections for M/F, each human along the way is going to approximate differently. The gal who enters the information will put F because "mostly female sex organs." The gal who is looking up the person's benefits in response to a phone call will put M because they sound manly on the phone. Etc.
&gt; If you have someone who doesn't convenient fit into M/F and your system only has selections for M/F, each human along the way is going to approximate differently. Actually, it's more a question of "what sex is specified in the official identification/tax preparation papers". Which is exactly one of two options - given by your medical record, based on genetic code (=sex organs) or eventually on sex readjustment procedures. It's nor an OOP question, or a database one, it's a legal thing, even if some people feel like multiethnical transsexual wolf/dragon-clones.
WPF, thanks.
Thanks, I already used those but they are not rendering it the way I want. Instead of the normal triangular waves that fall to zero and rise again, I'm getting half sinusoidal waves.

The OP of the Stackoverflow thread is against this for invalid reasons. His first reason for being against is that he thinks it is too verbose. I disagree. His second reason is that it makes no sense. This is subjective and to most programmers, it does make sense. You should definitely create a class in this situation which is a composition of all of the properties that define the object. Anything else is contrived and bad practice.
Because you probably only needed ICollection&lt;T&gt;. :p
Any thoughts on the accepted answer saying that it might not be best to say the team has a list of players either?
 The question is the basic failure of the concept of object orientated programming. In simple terms you should only inherit to extend. Not to save code (there are other ways to do this). This is because your class hierarchy of inheritance should have identical interfaces. For example. If you do class FootBallTeam : List&lt;Player&gt;; How do you now get FootBallTeam to act as a list? A FootBallTeam obviously isn't a List of Players. However it may contain a list of Player which is why it should be a property eg class FootBallTeam { List&lt;FootBallPlayer&gt; Players { get; } } Another obvious thing that would happen when you attempt to extend this further. Where do you put the list of sponsers / managers / trainers? Or as a good example of when you should inherit List&lt;&gt; would be if you wanted to build a sorted list. eg class SortedList&lt;T&gt; : List&lt;T&gt;; Now you have something that can be used with the List&lt;T&gt; but will be forced to be sorted no matter weather you access it by SortedList&lt;T&gt; or List&lt;T&gt;. The problem with attempting to use really bad inheritance like in the post. Might make something functional / work really quickly. But will generate a massive amount of technical debt down the line.
What kind of web service do you want to create? This sounds like you're using WCF, which is really heavy and probably way more than what you want and need. Take a look at www.asp.net/web-api - it's a great framework for writing web services that run over http. :-)
I have
I have been using asmx
That's really outdated. Perhaps you could elaborate your dependencies more. Do you want to use any transfer protocol, or would for example http be sufficient? Do you want to run your server in IIS, or self hosted, or where? ASP.NET Web Api or Nancy are good shots if http is enough for you.
"and they are in the same asp.net project" Do you mean solution? If not, what? How are they on different domains? Truly curious!
*Mostly* true - if you add a reference to the LINQPad executable yourself, you can co-opt the dumper for your own console/test harness programs...a handy thing to remember if you need to muck around with processes and/or app domains, since LINQPad doesn't play well in that arena.
Excellent point, thank you. :-)
solution :) yes sorry hmm let me get back to you on the exact setup
Tell him that you'll put him in a nice nursing home when the time comes. 
Well you could set the cross site permissions so one domain can ajax another site and have the client browser request it's session id from the other domain and then set that to it's one on the current domain... not sure about the security ramifications of all that though. Example: 1. Client visits http://domainA.com 2. Client's browser makes ajax request to http://domainB.com/what_is_my_session_handle 3. If client's browser gets back a valid session from domainB it makes an ajax request to http://domainA.com/set_my_session_handle with that data 4. Now both domains will have the same value for their sessions. Note to keep from getting weird issues with the 2 servers generating the same session handle for 2 different unique users (visitor 1 visits domainA and visitor2 visits domainB, they could end up with same session handle) you need to handle your own handle creation. I suggest sha1_hash(microtime() + client's ip) perhaps. 
I'd change the stackable to an int called stacksize. A stack of one is still a stack. I'd also create a base class for items that only has properties common to all items. You could then create other classes for different items types that inherit from that base class and possibly more classes that inherit from those if necessary. To put it simply, create a class for each item type and only add properties to it that no other classes have. Base class could have a name, stacksize (more?). Equipment would have all those and level, level req. etc. A weapon has all that and damage and so on. Maybe take a look into interfaces. I'm on my phone so can't go into too much detail. Hope this helped at least á little. One more thing, your character class would have properties that included some of those objects, e.g a feet property of type boot.
Entirely depends on what the purpose for modeling the Team is. Can a team be modeled as a list of historical facts that you can call methods on to produce the roster at any particular point in history? Sure. Is that overkill for a mobile phone game? You betcha.
I would create a property called MaxStackSize and then also have a StackSize property to keep the actual current size of the stack. Also for equip-able items like swords and armor I would create a class that extends item called EquipableItem and then create an enum with the [flags] setting that has all the locations things can be equipped in it. This will allow you to do multiple equip spots like a shield that goes on your arm or back using bitwise operators, example: EquipmentSlots.RightArm || EquipmentSlots.Back.
This is great, thank you :)
Good post. To follow up on "don't over expose properties that mutate state in an undesirable way", it's considered bad form in "pure OO" to expose properties at all. Objects pass messages to each other, they don't set each other's fields. C# is a little more pragmatic than that, obviously. Properties are syntactic sugar around functions, not fields. But outside of dumb data container objects and data transfer objects, something like a FootballTeam is meant to model how the state of a football team changes when operations are done to that team. You should not expose any public properties or methods that let someone using the class manipulate the state in a way that would make it invalid.
I studied mmorpg design for a long time, nothings ever come of it, but I have a lot of practical application knowledge on the stuff. If you have any other questions regarding rpg mechanics let me know.
That's a dangerous offer, I like learning new things. In all serious though, thanks - I really appreciate the help. 
IMHO everything is relative. Fast only has to be as fast as the actual business requirements calls for, same for correct. While I am not here to argue regarding these particular design decisions, I've been around the block and I assure you 95% of all developers out there are no academics. The world would not end if CopyTo would not be implemented, would it? Does CopyTo have any relation to meeting the business requirement? Perhaps, but unlikely. If my repository returns a List instead of the narrowest possible interface am I a complete failure? Let me answer this one, no I am not, somehow I survived many years as a professional developer, quite successfully. Again I am by no means stating that these principles are not important, but I am saying is that they are no end-all-be-all. There is time and place for everything.
OR you could use typesafe enum pattern which has been around for ages.
I think by far the best C# charting library I know of is [OxyPlot](http://www.oxyplot.org/). It works in mono, mono for android/ios, wpf, silverlight, winforms, windows 8, etc. Very nice library with tons of examples.
When you're getting help from people, they can often get you a solution better than you need. If I was doing some code review of an older project I probably wouldn't ask them to rewrite everything to use an Iterable interface; that being said, if they asked me ahead of time, I'd definitely recommend an iterable interface as opposed to IList. Business requirements and reality will never be the primary concern on an internet forums, be it stack overflow, reddit or any other resource. Everyone wants to give the best answer; and honestly, the academically best answer is often the best in these cases because I have yet to see anybody provide enough business details and information on their production staff to let me honestly tell them if something is "good enough," in reality.
