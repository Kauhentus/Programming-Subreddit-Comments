this topic has been beaten to death 1. start here: https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/ 2. remove things negated by php7 3. cross reference with this: https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonVsPhp 4. check performance benchmarks: https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/ 5. realize performance benchmarks are pointless for dynamic languages 6. realize performance benchmarks don't reflect real-world problems 7. learn that i/o is your bottleneck 8. accept there is no best language 9. accept that php is the most miserable, combining the worst features of C, java, and javascript 
Yeah I definitely do not underestimate MS paint after seeing [this](https://youtu.be/3eKBiEeag1A) video. I settled for gimp because I like working with layers, which paint lacks.
Great work! How long have you been programming in Python for?
got some youtube tips too btw
The version was 10.0.1
5 years.
That's a big HMM on my part.
&gt; beaten to death Not as much as PHP tho (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞ ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜)
Well, there's a number of reasons why businesses with large codebases wanted to delay. A) back in 2008 it wasn't guaranteed that Python 3 would have been the future of Python. Despite what Guido says, if the community had rejected Python 3 outright or there had been a lot of controversy, they might have had to create a Python 2.8. With the amount of money it takes to migrate, companies want to make damn sure that Py3 is the future. B) waiting a long time means being able to jump to a later version of Py3. Companies migrating now can move from Py2.7 to Py3.7 in one fell swoop.
brrr you made those in p y t h o n ? 
Where do i learn these kind of stuffs? I cant even draw a face

** no words **
Thanks, after the holidays I am going to make a concerted effort to finally learn some python and mess around some with ML.
I learned it by doing it. I never really followed any tutorials or anything. There's a timeline of my work on my old website: [https://dafluffypotato.github.io/art\_progress.html](https://dafluffypotato.github.io/art_progress.html) As you can see, my work from 2013 was very much what you'd expect from a beginner. 
I like the "retort" when through some of the above issues. Anything from 2012 is too old. Its like talking about Angelina Jolie from Tomb Raider to the Angelina Jolie now. Too much has changed.
This stuff is amazing. Guido Van Rossum would be really proud. 
Micro-benchmarks are not necessarily a good indicator of what language to use. Just use the one you know best, and you'll have the fewest issues.
Python's syntax is amazing for game development. I can get features implemented super fast. It's just that at the moment, there aren't any graphics libraries that are as efficient to the alternatives using other languages. Pygame works perfectly fine for pixel art stuff though. \^-\^ Pygame 2 is coming out sometime in the near future though. It's based on SDL2 and can finally make use of most GPUs from what I've heard. That'll make Python a perfectly valid option for game development.
This is really cool ! Great work man! Do you upload them to steam or how could we play them ?
Check Udemy.com, it up probably has something 
All of them (aside from the last one) are available here with the source: https://cmlsc.itch.io/ Super Potato Bruh (the only paid one) got a Steam release, but I'd recommend getting it on itch.io since it comes with the source AND a Steam key there.
I like it! very impressive work. I especially like "little guy with sword vs. big guy with spear". 
I can tell you why *I* am still supporting Python 2.7 apps: my client has production machines running somewhat expensive instrumentation that are stuck on Windows XP (and in one case, Windows 2000) because of a lack of newer drivers. These machines are working fine and there are enough hardware spares to keep them that way for a long time. Due to a series of dependencies, I need some libraries that have dropped support for XP under Python 3. Since the existing setup is working, nobody is going to pay me to back-port the libraries, or risk introducing bugs by making major architectural changes. It's not always about laziness.
Yeah, that's a work in progress. I'm planning to go heavy on the VFX for it. I'll probably make a post again here once I've released it. I've still got a long way to go though.
Beautiful 
Like you said, Python 2 works. &amp;#x200B; So does Python 3, so I write code that supports both. It's really not hard. I mean in terms of killer features, Python 3 doesn't really have any. It's 30% faster on my code, but I get that without doing any work or breaking backwards compatibility. &amp;#x200B; The ONLY reason for open source projects to drop Python 2 support is dependencies. Numpy and scipy drop support tomorrow. Matplotlib and VTK have. It's only a matter of time, but I'll get around to it.
I love the sense of action it conveys
I'm very new to python and I'm currently learning the basics (loops, booleans etc) so its pretty hard to understand how what I'm learning eventually transitions to this. Can someone explain in simple terms? 
Do you have any good resources or better docs for PyGame? I had a hard time finding anything solid to read.
Is this any good ?
I had similar "problems" when I first started coding in Python - it just does everything for you! I'd implement stuff like `split` and `join` from scratch, just for someone to tell me the day after that I could have done it with one clean line of code. And the way to overcome this is really just a matter of practice and reading docs. Reading the docs of modules/classes/functions you are using is important.

The Pygame docs cover everything, but you may need a basic understanding of Pygame to understand the docs. (I'd recommend tutorials for that.) [https://www.pygame.org/docs/](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)
Can you recommend any good tutorials or books that you personally like?
Thanks! I feel like I'm just a little overwhelmed. Feeling like I have to memorize an endless list of modules. I don't know which ones I have to memorize. I don't know which ones are the most important. 
I'd recommend that you continue to learn Python. After that you can learn Pygame. If you don't understand the basics of Python and how to apply them, you'll have a hard time learning to make games with Pygame.
I used an older edition of this: https://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/ I think it's a pretty good tutorial. :D
Awesome, much appreciated!!
Any of these good?
I would install [ipython](https://ipython.org/) it is a powerful beefed up terminal that gives you tab completion. I usually keep a ipython terminal open while I am programming so I can learn and explore new libraries easily. It will even help you with you're importing. &amp;#x200B; For example, &amp;#x200B; from collections import Counter counter = Counter() counter. # hit tab to view all the available methods for Counter() &amp;#x200B;
Great work, man!
How about sprites/animations? What's your process there?
I have pycharm. Should I still get this? maybe I haven't been using the drop down menu thing as much
[PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org) is great for beginners.
things have changed, but most of those retorts are still valid and accurate
I use vscode, however, I just alt-tab between the two.
Humble bundle just came out with a python bundle oddly enough. Seems like a smattering of everything so I'm going to pick it up.
Have not heard of Packt... looking on Amazon it looks like most of these books were published within the last year or so. Very few reviews and those with reviews are very short on actual reviewing.
Best of luck to you
A while back you posted a video detailing how you dealt with [collision detecting] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=a_YTklVVNoQ) and I just wanted to say that was super helpful. I'm a complete novice with coding in general and surprisingly I was able to follow along. Would love to see some more tutorials from ya! 
Python is better for me because I can write it faster and cleaner than I can PHP or anything in JS. It'd be interesting to see comparisons based on utility but everything I'm writing has some time between when it needs to be implemented and when it needs to be the most efficient implementation. 
Would love to hear some opinions on these books
No need to maintain. Run it on aws. Bitnami kafka is great! But yeah I think there is a better solution unless this is a legit commercial application.
I use MS Paint for static images and [a tool I made](https://cmlsc.itch.io/px-editor) for animations.
Yeah, I’m busy with another project right now, but I fully intend to continue my Pygame tutorial series.
For those interested, the Machine Learning book is well liked in the applied machine learning field. I have TAed two modules that used it and the students seemed to like it. It's not a perfect book by any means, especially the part about neural networks is a bit outdated, but it serves as a decent introduction to ML.
I remember when you posted this tool It was very impressive and I’ve thought about it a lot since then
Ah that's not a bad idea actually. I will look into declaring my own exceptions, I was just looking into how to make this work, and that seemed to be the simplest method to start with. Do you know of anything I could read about to learn more about this?
Oh right, this is a function I knew about like 9 months ago, and then forgot. Thanks!
You can do a couple Google searches and find out about Packt Publishing, their business model, etc.
What variety of environments? 99% of Python is either a Django e-commerce site that is deployed to AWS-styled Ubunu, or some data-mining scripts which are authored through the dashboard of the system that's supposed to run them. Horrible practice is to make people wait 10 minutes every redeploy for your 5 files to be installed. I've been in the business long enough to be able to compare the cost of maintaining installs based on `pip` or, god forbid, `pipenv` and a home-made shell script. The second wins by a landslide. The caveat: you need to read two pages manual explaining how Python locates and imports your code, but most Python monkeys are only writers, they don't know how to read.
Depends on what you want to do. Python has shortcuts for everything. I can imagine that it's hard to get used to a language that puts an abstraction layer on top of C. I personally don't feel like I have to remember a lot of stuff but that might just be because I have been using Python for 6 years full-time now. I keep getting back to the same libraries every time, so really, just use what you need and you'll remember it someday.

I would suggest to read the source code of the packages you use. If something throws you an exception go to the exact location in the package that throws an exception and look for what checks does it do that results in exception. In general, most usable packages are well documented within the source code + professional programmers use all kind of shortcuts that are available in Python so the source code may teach you a lot. 
I'm surprised that fractal of a bad design is still something people think is relevant to php7.
Thanks for this post, I must have misunderstood initially, and thought mine was already CLI based. Can you explain a bit more about that? Are you sayinty program wouldn't run itself, but specific functions from it would run instead? And I'd love any help on this! Thanks for the post!
Generally, Python is not better at PHP at anything you're going to be able to benchmark. How are you going to benchmark developer productivity, deployment ease, maintainability, etc?
For 2d games I found [arcade](http://arcade.academy/) be better than Pygames. It has better api and is much faster (due to openGL rendering) than Pygames. It also leverages python3 static type annotation's which is much helpful and prevents many errors.

Don't be so naive in what people use Python for. &gt; Horrible practice is to make people wait 10 minutes every redeploy for your 5 files to be installed.

But not only am I not telling you what the experience is nor how much, nor will I bother to prove it, I will advise against what proven capable professionals say. Oh also I'm smarter than all of you other code monkeys".
Just remember that when you want to do something, there's often already a library available to do it. Then Google around to find the docs. This is particularly the case if it feels like something you or someone else will want to do more than once. No need to explicitly try to memorize everything that is built-in, just use the heuristic "someone has probably already solved this problem", then find their solution. After awhile, you'll just remember stuff that you do often.
I am working on some storytelling to teach Python programming to children. This story has a chick, a dog, and a hen. Next, I am going to add some more actors (cat, duck) and make the stories more complicated.

Is it a common practice to store compose file in the project?
And also be suspect to mostly false reviews. The internet is a horrible place to search for reviews. The idea in asking here is it's more likely to be real as it's personal.
really, amazing job, as a py programmer i can assure you, it's a great job!
I’ve heard about arcade before. From what I understand, it’s a lot more restrictive. It makes you do things their way and doesn’t have the lower level features Pygame has. Also, I just read through their Pygame comparison page and a lot of the information is wrong or outdated. When Pygame 2 comes out, it should be better than arcade by a long shot.

Some suggestions: * You shouldn't need to mount a volume for /www in your prod compose file. Doing so is useful for dev so you can hot reload, but isn't required for prod because you've copied the application code into the container when you built it * Instead of mounting your config file inside the nginx container, I tend to make a new Dockerfile FROM the nginx image, and add the config file in at that point. Doing this means that when you deploy, all you need is the compose file, your environment file, and the built container images - it saves you from having to manage files on the prod servers, and makes life easier when you move to things like Swarm or Kubernetes
Oh fuck them really. It's the old version of the Mastering Python Networking book in the pack, not the 2018 version, even though that's the photo shown in the pack page.
Do you have a job as a developer? Or programmer?

`is` tests if the *objects* are the same, not their value. You want `==` instead.
Nope. I'm hoping to get some type of CS job in the first half of 2020 for some experience before I go to uni though.
There are a few bugs with your code, but really, the core of the issue is you're using `is` to compare strings. That compares string instances, which is pretty much guaranteed to fail. You want to use `==` to see if the strings are the same: artist_list=['artista', 'artistb'] song_list=['songa', 'songb'] runningtotal = 0 for count in range(len(artist_list)): guess = input('song name for ' + artist_list[count] + ' goes here:') if guess.lower() == song_list[count].lower(): print('correct') runningtotal += 1 else: print('incorrect') 
== returned the same errors 
== returned the same errors 
No, it doesn't. The code I posted works: $ python3 example.py song name for artista goes here:songa correct song name for artistb goes here:nope, don't know incorrect 
Thanks! You too! Make much stuff in 2019.
This is awesome! Great work.
Those are actually good points that's harder to measure because of the way it can vary depending on the developer.
Awesome stuff. May I ask how old you are?
17
Ill try it with your amendments too, thanks
oops missed 100mb size, never mind then
Please share if it works out! I have plenty of ugly data I'd like to use in Excel
That’s awesome, I’m 30 and have no CS experience and have just started doing online courses this year. Hoping to change careers in the next few years.
The brackets at .lower seemed to have fixed it, thanks 
Impressive and truly inspiring!! 
Thanks for the feedback! I do need to update the ReadMe a bit, I figured the program would be self explanatory once it got running, but no on is going to run it without a good readme. 
The cookbooks are usually ok. O’Rielly media though is my gold standard.
a gif?
Sure. The conversion part is very simple. The Gui part with PyQt5 is the hard part. 
This is awesome work! It’s good to see people showing off their skills! I want to get into game development myself. My main focus has mainly been app development and web development. If you are ever in collaborating on a project in the near future, I’d love to partner with someone of your talents!
Yeah it's highly customizable and allows for some in-depth fine tuning at the ease of python's structure. Love the engine.
Are you selling any of your games on steam or online as a flash game?
Wow good
PyCharm is awesome. Stick to that. Visual Studio form Microsoft is really good too.
Happen to have it on a repo? My strong point is *not* GUi's.
It’s referenced basically always. I think a lot of people who do reference it haven’t seen the changes in the current language. Some of the issues are still valid, such as inconsistent arguments for built-in functions but I find those weak in the face of modern editors and IDEs. It’s not like I’m memorizing argument structure even when consistent since my editor always reminds me what needs to happen. I think the thing that is always overlooked about PHP vs Node or Python or whatever is that PHP programs live for a single request. The model for how it works is quite different from other backend languages and there are pros and cons to that which I never find discussed.
You may be able to find an easier way to upload the file by doing an upload in your browser with the developer tools installed and the network tab open. Listed there will be the requests, headers and content that your browser sent and using that info you can recreate those requests in a program. Here is an example: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#post-a-multipart-encoded-file
Yes, I'm selling [Super Potato Bruh](https://store.steampowered.com/app/951360/Super_Potato_Bruh/) on Steam, but I'd recommend [getting it from itch.io](https://cmlsc.itch.io/super-potato-bruh) as it includes a Steam key and source code. I also get a *much* larger revenue share.
But the behaviour would be consistent with the handling of scope in functions, modules and packages. Classes are an odd-one out, and for very good reason. Since my concept of namespace is that it is closer to a module than a class -- it is *exactly* a module, except you don't need to split it out to a separate physical file on disk Think about how scoping works in modules: *inside* module "aardvark.py", you don't have to explicitly reference the `aardvark` namespace (module object) to refer to objects in the same namespace: # we do this a = 1 print(a) # we DON'T do this inside the aardvark module a = 1 print(aardvark.a) Now consider that this namespace concept is a kind of module object (without being a separate file). It should work the same way. Or perhaps a better way of thinking about it is to think of namespace objects as (semantically) fundamental, and modules being a kind of namespace that requires separate files. So we have: namespaces &lt; modules &lt; packages To my mind, the *whole point* of a (non-class) namespace is to work this way. If I had to explicitly reference the same namespace I'm in, *I would never use them as they would be useless for me*. Bottom line is: my concept of namespaces is that they are like modules, not like classes, and so the class behaviour is not relevant. 
Good luck!
Do you mean adding a gif to the readme to show it in action?
better than lots of words
Pop now ?
pip was kind of pioneering in terms of being a semi-official package manager dedicated to a specific language. RubyGems was able to copy the general idea from pip while avoiding a lot of its mistakes. Most of the subsequent package mangers in turn are based on RubyGems.
I actually meant to post it there. My bad, thanks for the info though!
Python is OOP paradigm at heart which means you do end up working with a lot of created functions and objects. Don't memorize them. Remember the names of different libraries and what they're used for, and then when you need them, go look up documentation. Memorize the basic pythonic way of doing things (e.g. list comprehension, etc) and leave it at that. Almost anything is possible in python, which is good and bad. Simplify your life by sticking to the core concept of parameters -&gt; function -&gt; return value. Understand the concept of objects, attributes, and methods. Keep track of namespaces, e.g. if you say import collections as fuckshitfoo, you can only call counter by saying fuckshitfoo.counter. You can't use objects if you don't import their modules and reference the module. Etc. Once you get the hand of all that, python is probably the easiest language in the world next to R. 
What are your leaning sources? Incredible job!!
Mostly the other people's code and documentation. For the programming side of game development, I don't really reference other people's stuff anymore. There aren't any similar open source projects anyway.
Lol Excel is really universal - first in the list of a network engineer. 
Why the benchmark ?
Not publically right now. I'm just using one built with PyQt5's designer application. It's drag and drop similar to Visual Studio.

I'm not op but yes absolutely! Learning Python in the beginning was very boring. It was hard to stay focused and whenever I learned something new I didn't actually see the value in it. I struggled to stay focused and it felt like I would never do anything useful. I kept doing tutorials for random things and slowly I began to understand more about what I was doing. That let me build cool projects of my own which made me feel more comfortable with python and coding.
Thanks for the feedback! First point: I'll update the article now. Second: I'll try this out and see how it goes!
Happy New Year
I got a coding book for Christmas and the book says it uses Kali for specific things I guess. &amp;#x200B; I looked up where to try to download "libpango" and couldn't find anything about it, no exact website and other forums couldn't help.
I think he was taking the piss, that's not a library that exists (unfortunately)
That's entirely from the recording software. It's a bunch of gifs combined into an MP4. Some of the gifs were recorded at 16 fps (I think one of them is 8 fps). My current PC works with Pygame's hardware acceleration and I can get 1000+ fps on a lot of my games, but on my laptop that doesn't work with Pygame's hardware acceleration, I get 60 to 120 depending on the game.
It’s goes well with his Udemy course that I think you can get 80% off by using the link in his YouTube video. I’m doing right now and it’s pretty good.
No. When it comes to Packt texts, always steal them rather than pay. Even $1 is too much for the shit that they try to pull.
Wrote a Packt book. Can confirm.
Thank you! I was so disappointed when GitHub's game jam didn't have a single python entry.
Great, that's kind of what I figured.
Ah ah gotcha, OK. Thanks not a bad idea
It looks like an error occurs when you hit cancel when opening a pallet. &gt;Traceback (most recent call last): &gt; File "./Px Editor 3.py", line 814, in &lt;module&gt; base_path = palette_path.split('/')[:-1] &gt; AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'split' 
Great book. I am pretty sure there is a free YouTube playlist out there somewhere as well. Learned a lot from those. 
That's weird. It's not reproducing on my end.
Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw](https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw) My personal favorite for all things code is thenewboston. This is his Python 3.4 playlist: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAcbMi1sH6oAMk4JHw91mC\_](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAcbMi1sH6oAMk4JHw91mC_) He has 2.1 million subscribers for a reason! &amp;#x200B; I'm working on a tutorial series of my own designed for kids. My goal is to have the learners using the new information right away. [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZtM2trDoW57BrIv73EHAqBtKweWIxrHv](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZtM2trDoW57BrIv73EHAqBtKweWIxrHv) &amp;#x200B; I hope one of these resources helps! Happy learning.
 I've used this before. It is a bit old and the Python dialect is a bit lacking but it is a really fun place for kids to. Learn to Program with Minecraft https://nostarch.com/programwithminecraft 
Awesome work bro..! 
Agreed; however, if your data will fit on the SSD, then you should put it there unless it is a movie of photo file. Those can always stay on HDD.
I just remembered that I changed the python version from 3.4 to 3.6 to force it to run, I'm sure that's what borked it. My bad. However, as an FYI line 813 reads &gt; if palette_path not in ['',None]: You could just change that to &gt; if palette_path: as None and empty objects evaluate to false.
Sentdex has some great tutorials. Also check out his AI plays GTA videos, very cool.
This book was an amazing introduction! I hope you find it as useful (:
Ah thanks, I wasn't aware that `''` counted as False.
The [learning resources](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index) over on /r/learnpython should get you started on python itself. Also try searching on "python robotics" to get more into the application of python to robotics. The robotics club should also have someone who will tell you what hardware they commonly use and if you can get help with python. You can get help with the python language by asking questions over on /r/learnpython.

Now I don't know if it's the best source for kids but it definetly is otherwise: sentdex on youtube. Also there was a 35C3 Talk "teaching programming to your loved ones" or something. There were lots of Talks about programming with children in fact. If he's into robotics and wants to use Python adafruit is also a company to look out for. They have lots of (freely accessible) stuff aimed specifically at introducing kids to electronics and embedded systems (for example with python). And another thing: maybe take a look at assembler for embedded stuff. Now, not as the first introduction, but it really is great to see stuff at (nearly) the most atomical layer to understand and learn it, also you don't need to deal with stuff like datatypes, parantheses etc. so the code can be quite nice to read. Also you can do it for 3-4 bucks (+programmer, starting at 10€ or so)
Haha.

God I need to just sit down and actually do some coding instead of playing video games.
Here's one possibility http://installion.co.uk/kali/kali/main/l/libpango-1.0-0/install/index.html which I found googling "Kali libpango"
In this specific case, it's better to *lean* outside of windows
I have that problem most of the time...
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar.
I’m a Mac and Linux user, no worries there. 
I keep hearing about people who've stuck with it for 2 or 3 years or even less and already accomplished alot... meanwhile, I started learning back in 2012 and well I've had a great start but I never had direction or anyone to properly guide me. Ive been stuck on wrapping my head around class method for the past 4 years ..... and although I know how it appears to work, I still don't really get it. You ask me right now when I should use classes... after 5 years ... i dunno. 
was going to say "who this ?" then I found out I'm subscribed to his channel
Hi Guys, I wrote a post explaining JIT and PyPy and demonstrated how PyPy can Speed up your python code. Anyways I am happy to receive feedback on this article Happy New Year Everyone !!
HDD are better for data, than SSD. An HDD may spin up again, but once an SSD dies, it's usually dead.
&gt; because of how easy it is to use Damn I must be stupid then. I found pygame to be really confusing and unwieldy, but I'm very good with python so I guess the theory just confused me 
There is no need for PyCharm to sit on a SSD drive. This IDE does some heavy indexing on each start, but it doesn't block your work and takes less than a minute to complete on a medium sized project (HDD). I'm pretty sure you will not be restarting PyCharm every few minutes. It's a very well optimized application. What you do need is enough RAM. PyCharm usually eats ~750MB of memory (much less with small projects). Java...
Could you clarify this a bit for someone who is genuinely interested in picking up a few books to learn about Python? What makes the Packt books subpar?
Use run configurations. You can define commands to launch and assign names to each configuration there. Then, they will be accessible through a dropdown list near the "Run" button.
Google "DRY principle".
I was offered an outline to write. What did you think of the process?
&gt; *subtle pc in background*
Great work!
Kind of a nightmare. At the end of the day, it's cool to be able to say that I wrote a book, but holy shit. Things might have changed, but at the time there was no set of rules. At least, none that I was handed. In hindsight, I should have asked for rules/parameters. But it was my first book, and I didn't really know. I just started writing. It was a lot of back and forth over, "here you go" met with, "no, you didn't do {this} part to spec" (not that "spec" was ever laid out). Lots of hours wasted. Poor communication. No leadership/guidance. In a nutshell. 
The function names confuse a decent amount of people. Idk, but you may want to take a look at my tutorials. They cover a decent amount of the basics and I've been told I explain it well: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxRhvyZXd8I&amp;t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxRhvyZXd8I&amp;t)
I only use classes when they're legitimately useful, so I don't use them for everything. I sacrifice readability in the process, but it speeds up development. If you take a look at my source, you'll see that I usually use &lt; 10 classes for my projects.
Discord name LeoX #8531 i have a white and black profile picture.
This looks really cool! I have a genuine question though. I know python but never really thought of making a game with it. Why use python for game development? Is there a certain platform that’s best with python?
His udemy course is amazing too!
Definitely go through this book step by step. This book taught me so much!! I love it!
Thank you for the tip! I already know a decent amount as I’m in i I for comp sci but I love t learn! So I’m really excited about this book. I’ve read the first couple of pages and I’m already drawn in. 
Thanks! First bundle in awhile where I didn't have most of the books before.
Python’s syntax makes dev super fast.
Just started learning python and damn there are so many good websites linked here. Btw i use "code academy pro" to learn python 3 though a lot of people dont recomend it so im not sure
Oh, no worries. I sent you an add request from justoneprimate#1664. I'm a TOTAL newb to programming AND python, though I will say I have picked it up rather easily so far. I think the reason I want to do this is to learn to build good algorithms. Meaning...take an Idea of a action the game would make, and figure out how to translate it into solid code. Piece by piece and absolutely in no rush. Will also help me get solid with Git and such.
Great work! Are you going to make more Pygmalion tutorials? There great!
Shady business practices (continued and unwanted billing has been a problem). Quantity over quality contracting practices. Mandated hand-holding format for most contracted writers doesn't really make for very useful or quality texts. Of course, there are exceptions to be found. However, for the most part they are a publisher that you want to avoid. Their books rarely make the charts and generally your money can be much better spent elsewhere.
Yep. I’m just busy with another project at the moment.
I believe there is a syntax error in your code, it should read: print("Happy New Year")
Just google whatever problem you want to solve. 9 out 0f 10 times you find someone doing it in one line on stack overflow. Your goal then is to understand how tha line works. Seriously - don't just copy-paste it. Understand it. As a practical simple example: You need to create a list of consecutive numbers. You then google something like "python create list of consecutive numbers". Surely one of first entries will show you how to use `range` function. Now you know how to do it. Optionally I'd recommend looking at `range` docs after that to see what else it is capable to do. You don't have to memorise everything. I've worked with Python for 5 years and every once in a while I still have to google some stuff that is so basic, I'm not even proud to admit. The important thing is that you retain the "there is something that does this kind of stuff" and then re-google the docs if you forget exactly how it does it. Initially I also came from the C world and honestly, most of my Python was learned by googling specific problems and stackoverflow. Little by little I've got as far as to create my own web APIs and even understand relatively complex projects like the [OpenEdx](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform) codebase.
Nice! Congrats! I took the course on Udemy but for sure I'll buy the ebook to support the author. He is an amazing guy.
I never knew he had a Udemy course tbh. I have a bunch of courses on there for python and other language but I can’t seem to get it by watching a video. I learn it better by reading a physical copy!
It's awesome you even and a tool for pixel graphics! Cool stuff man. Good luck with your current project, looks beautiful.
Incredible information...thank for the post 
Did you try the program?
You bet!
I am new to programming, I am already learning python, I will learn any new language after learning it thoroughly.
Inspiring! Awesome work. 
Great! I have his computer games python book, and It has come in handy a lot.
It's really good book!
&gt; I looked up where to try to download "libpango" and couldn't find anything about it, Next time try: apt search libpango from your terminal
The hard part isn’t the python. It’s finding stuff to automate
Kali is more of a penetration testing distro though, so thats weird.
Sounds like an awesome idea. I'd love to see how it pans out.
&gt; Not a virus That;s totally not suspicious one bit.
 hey I have been working on a game in Python and when adding my spirites everything is running really fast someone here maybe knows how to fix this? Thanks.
Man… someone told me they were reading this book as sort of an intro to programming (or, at least, getting more serious about it) and I was so goddamn proud.
Use Pygame's clock feature. You can use it to keep the frames in time with the desired FPS. I believe I mentioned it in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxRhvyZXd8I
I personally don't use an IDE - just the mypy tool. But correct, the types don't serve the CPU.
its a battlestation
&gt; Python is slow compared to other languages. Python is fast compared to other languages too. It depends on *which* other languages you are comparing to. You give no code, no instructions for how to use PyPy, no way for us to judge the quality of the Python and C code, just a bunch of time results. In other words, almost totally information-free. 
Why did you use flask over django?
Thanks for the feedback I thought it comparing the time it took to complete the program would be fine but overall it’s a loop that is used to calculate the squares of 1million numbers 
Why am I learning DP when I could be doing THIS?
Michael?
It's simpler and I wasn't making something super complex.
What's DP?
Dynamic programming, also known as one of the most useless concepts on the planet.
What are you talking about? `RubyGems` is almost 10 years older than `pip`. But there were other package managers for specific languages way-way earlier than `pip`. Maven, for instance, is also about a decade older than `pip`. Obviously, `easy_install` also existed way before `pip`.
Still we haven’t seen the code. Also PyPy really isn’t Python. Now this may sound funny as Python is about the only language I use anymore but the fact is it is slow. However it fits my needs rather well at this time. In a nut shell people should worry more about a language fitting their needs rather than somebodies evaluation of speed. 
Yeah, do you read stats that StackOverflow: django × 95585 python-3.x × 88107 pandas × 79103 python-2.7 × 57030 numpy × 49471 list × 34698 matplotlib × 30187 dictionary × 24960 regex × 22574 dataframe × 21209 I.e. like I said, a typical Python monkey either works on an e-commerce website, or is not a programmer at all and doesn't need any kind of deployment. (Btw, I don't do web development, and, unlike overwhelming majority of all people who write something in Python actually do need to deploy my code to different platforms due to the nature of the product: I'm in the storage business and I actually need my code to run on a handful of Linuxes and Windows). For most people, however, all they have is the "developer's environment", the "CI environment" and the "production environment", where CI and production are specifically configured to be exactly the same. Because most Python programmers are noobs / don't know how to use their computers well, they work on Windows, whereas the production environment is often a sort of Linux, so they do need the code to run somehow in two different settings, but very quickly they come to conclusion that it doesn't really work like that / programs like `pip` offer very little help in solving these problems and then they start running their code in a VM / container, or just don't run it at all, and wait for CI to do the job. &gt; proven capable professionals In Python? Hahahaha. That's like looking for medieval French literature specialists among uncontacted tribal people of Amazonian rain-forests. People who write about Python in overwhelming majority of cases are some code monkeys, the same kind once associated with PHP-JavaScript mold. The bottom-feeders of programming world... capable professionals... lol
&gt; Yeah, do you read stats that StackOverflow: And you show one high django statistic and the rest debunk yout point. Do you really think all of that is just datamining? &gt; I.e. like I said, a typical Python monkey either works on an e-commerce website, or is not a programmer at all and doesn't need any kind of deployment. Why do you jump to "code monkeys", oh great DevGod? You have forsaken me! &gt; Because most Python programmers are noobs / don't know how to use their computers well, they work on Windows, whereas the production environment is often a sort of Linux, so they do need the code to run somehow in two different settings, but very quickly they come to conclusion that it doesn't really work like that / programs like `pip` offer very little help in solving these problems and then they start running their code in a VM / container, or just don't run it at all, and wait for CI to do the job. So you * again decide to insult the majority of Python developers intelligence/competence * assume their requirements * assume their dependency replication system * assume they can't solve simple problems Really? &gt; In Python? Hahahaha. That's like looking for medieval French literature specialists among uncontacted tribal people of Amazonian rain-forests. People who write about Python in overwhelming majority of cases are some code monkeys, the same kind once associated with PHP-JavaScript mold. The bottom-feeders of programming world... capable professionals... lol Firstly, extremely rude-- why even bother stay on this sub that you think consists of such foolish idiotic people? Secondly, I meant developers high up in organizations like the PSF or the PyPA-- or are they all also idiots compared to you, and your 200+IQ that can write code in x86/64 assembly in their sleep? What kind of ego do you have man? Take it down the entire fucking knob of notches.
isn't dynamic programming just creating a simple cache for similarly solved problems? how wouldn't that be useful?
Great. I also started with this one and enjoyed very much.
Isn't that book outdated? I found it on amazon and it's latest version is from 2015. Does it matter and is the book still helpful?
Heh, I know that. I don't know what the parameters should be in my configuration, so that I replicate PyScaffold's setup.cfg settings.
Yes it's still helpful. While certain libraries amd frameworks may be outdated, the programming concepts you learn are still applicable. 
Thanks
Use virtual env😁
Oh great! However games in python seems like games of 90s. But I know that designing these games is not an easy task at all. Well great games you've developed. Good luck! 
How does this differ from the post a mere 13 hours ago? https://old.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/aba8yp/humble_book_bundle_python_2019_by_packt/
Did you buy that?
This has nothing to do with Python.
Dude, the rest... can you even read? The rest screams "I am not a programmer": the questions about Pandas, NumPy and dataframes imply that those people are doing some machine learning, not programming. These people don't even know what deployment means or why it is needed. &gt; again decide to insult the majority of Python developers intelligence/competence At least I am consistent and know what I am talking about, whereas you just... well write words, I guess :) &gt; assume they can't solve simple problems Several decades in the industry, yeah, I know that most programmers are borderline incompetent, and that is if we only count those who did get hired. If we also consider those who didn't, we are pretty much living in a circus or a zoo. &gt; why even bother stay on this sub that you think consists of such foolish idiotic people? There's nothing as exciting as tell an idiot that he is an idiot, why did this not cross your mind? &gt; developers high up in organizations like the PSF or the PyPA-- or are they all also idiots compared to you Borderline retarded, why? IQ has very little to do with it. Not everyone with high IQ is a good programmer and not all good programmers have exceptionally high IQ. PS, Assembly language is actually very easy to write in. That is absolutely not indicative of skill. Writing good programs is hard, but writing in any particular practical language (well, not things like Malbolge) is trivial. 
&gt; On mobile btw so had to type out this goddamn code. Then don't be a dick, wait until you get on a real computer and can post the code properly instead of expecting us to decipher a mess of incorrect code you retyped from memory on a mobile.
it is still largely relevant. php7 only added unimpressive syntactic improvements and performance optimizations. the design of the language is still the same that being said, i wasn't referencing it for its accuracy or relevance but that it's an inevitable step in researching the topic at hand
Bad bot.
&gt; realize performance benchmarks are pointless for dynamic languages Wot? So because I'm using a dynamic language, it doesn't matter that my shitty code takes three hours to finish a task that could finish in three seconds if I were a better programmer? Awesome! 
&gt; As for python, performance is bad unless you use packages with the underlying code written in C, C++, fortran, rust, cython, etc Nonsense. I write plenty of pure Python code that is fast enough. 
&gt; You know, that was the first thing I did. But the solution didn’t suit the situation. How did it not suit? Are we supposed to guess how your situation is different from everyone else's situation? 
https://code.activestate.com/recipes/577977-get-single-keypress/ 
&gt; I think a lot of people who do reference it haven’t seen the changes in the current language i use it at work, and the changes don't improve major flaws &gt; Some of the issues are still valid, such as inconsistent arguments for built-in functions but I find those weak in the face of modern editors and IDEs. It’s not like I’m memorizing argument structure even when consistent since my editor always reminds me what needs to happen. IDEs do help with the parameter order, but PHP is not very discoverable due to the lack of namespacing and/or OOP, so that only helps if you can remember the name of the function you need. so you don't need to memorize parameters, but with php you do need to memorize lots of function names. inconsistent naming conventions makes this more difficult &gt; I think the thing that is always overlooked about PHP vs Node or Python or whatever is that PHP programs live for a single request. The model for how it works is quite different from other backend languages and there are pros and cons to that which I never find discussed. it is not discussed because it has nothing to do with the languages. that's a server issue
&gt; I can only program in Python and only with Jupyter notebooks. Then spend fifteen minutes to learn how to program in Python without Jupyter. If you already know the syntax, language and libraries, the rest is easy. 
no, that's not what that means. you're overlooking the context or willfully ignoring it shitty code will perform equally shittily in any language. benchmarking that won't improve anything. but that's not what we're talking about benchmarks for dynamic languages are pointless because either a) the performance differences are either marginal and have no meaningful advantage, b) they are orders of magnitude slower than compiled, statically typed languages, and/or c) irrelevant because they are using a C implementation of some algorithm
&gt; node, php, python, ruby All these languages suck too much to be real contenders for image processing, why even... do you ask yourself questions like: would it be better to fly to Mars on a cart or on a horse? Realistically, neither of the languages above does any image processing on their own, they all would use some library written in another language. As for "better"... idk, the two languages are too similar / essentially in the same ballpark. You may come up with some answer to that question, but the answer will be not useful.
What’s ur book called?
&gt; The rest screams "I am not a programmer": the questions about Pandas, NumPy and dataframes imply that those people are doing some machine learning, not programming. These people don't even know what deployment means or why it is needed. ...because who said so, you? &gt; &gt; again decide to insult the majority of Python developers intelligence/competence &gt; At least I am consistent and know what I am talking about, whereas you just... well write words, I guess :) Except you gave poor advice. You're talking out of the corner of your ass which is your specific needs and work. &gt; Several decades in the industry, yeah, I know that most programmers are borderline incompetent, and that is if we only count those who did get hired. If we also consider those who didn't, we are pretty much living in a circus or a zoo. I can only assume you have coworkers. I wonder how they'd feel when you call them incompetent. Or are they exempt too? &gt; There's nothing as exciting as telling an idiot that he is an idiot, why did this not cross your mind? Thats less exciting and more sadistic asshole. &gt; Borderline retarded, why? IQ has very little to do with it. Not everyone with high IQ is a good programmer and not all good programmers have exceptionally high IQ. Yes yes, IQ is not the same as experience and wisdom or even being "smart". It's a common marker used as a presictive element of those things though. &gt; PS, Assembly language is actually very easy to write in. That is absolutely not indicative of skill. Writing good programs is hard, but writing in any particular practical language (well, not things like Malbolge) is trivial. Writing assembly is easy. But I didn't just say assembly, I said "in your sleep". Or have you never heard of hyperbole? Either way there's no use continuing this conversation. Your entire being appears to be 99% ego and that's some extremely disgusting narcissism. So have a good day. Hope you have whatever is bringing you to act like this diagnosed and treated.
Well, no wonder... if people writing in C, usually, solve programming problems, people writing in Python, usually, solve IT problems, i.e. building web-sites, bindings to other (actual) programs, tests, automation. I.e. the kind of knowledge a typical Python "programmer" has isn't abstract / structured / procedural / algorithmic, it's taxonomic, i.e. unordered list of "things that exist" without explanations or purpose attached. If you ever red The Pillow Book, it's like that, just long lists of things one likes or dislikes. The question is then why are you going into Python? What's in it for you? As for `counter`, it's probably this: https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/collections.html#collections.Counter (i.e. capital C).
Yup
Lol I know what you mean. Does anyone know a good website that provides projects/challenges for this situation? 
Good point, sorry 
I actually think those comparisons are mostly useless. It's squaring numbers it is a highly predictive task and basically only requires very trivial cpu instruction. My guess is that would be the ideal case for a JIT compiler, it probably becomes just a compiler after the first step in the loop. In addition to that there's no code and compiler settings mention, which can affect the result by a lot (20x time difference between my different compiler settings is no rare occurrence).
Yes
it free online - [https://automatetheboringstuff.com/](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
Is this book good if you are a total beginner or do you require atleast the basics of programming? 
Don't have any resources but i'd probably recommend you to look into matplotlib and numpy. I'd say you can combine math and programming, which is probably great for learning both. And it's always nice to be able to visualize things you program for robotics. You can probably solve some of the easier challanges at https://www.codingame.com/home or https://www.codewars.com/ after learning the basics. Just pick the ones that seem interesting to you, there might be some AI / Robotics related ones in there. 
Some good stuff there.
Yes. Humble Bundle is spelled incorrectly.
"Head First! Python" Is a wonderful book too! &amp;#x200B;
No one said it is not fast enough. The question is comparatively to other languages. Pure python vs c++ or even Java will never win, just a fact. And it is ok ;)
At least two exact posts already on the front page https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/aba3qy/humble_book_bundle_python_2019_by_packt/ https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/abdqhn/hummblebundle_packt_python_library_2019_pay_what/
It does start by touching on the basic concepts although personally I do feel it's a tad quick over the basics however the examples of how to automate and exercises that are given are invaluable. If you're not sure you can always read the book for free at https://automatetheboringstuff.com Some other resources to check are Corey Schafer's YouTube channel, he has a great beginners playlist, and the Python Discord channel where you can ask questions in real time. Good luck and any issues let us know! 
Psst(It is free online)

Take a look at the Software Carpentry Python workshop: https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/ It's complete with an instructor manual, and contains all the course material. If nothing else, it might give you some ideas for your own course :)
How come only some of the games are compatible with Linux as well? 
Kind of like approaching a random person on the street with "I'm not going to mug you!".
Nice work! Keep learning!
what libraries or game engine do you use? sorry, noob here.
wrote a beginner book, the real basics, https://www.pythonmembers.club/lightweight-learn-python-book/
I don't understand. You have parameters listed in setup.cfg (as above). What other parameters do you need? 
like trinket or otherwise, popular ones like numpy etc available, else tried in a pendrive?
r/learnpython
So you literally flicked through tutorials for random stuff until you felt you could combine what you'd learnt to make something? I don't feel confident enough to know what I can actually do with python yet.
I'm writing a book at the moment that intends to cater to beginners, so I'm saving this post for when the early access is available. I'd love your feedback, and most of all to help you if I can!
And did you know there's a free version you can read online, as u/ump200iq said?
Just convert the input to int. use:- num=int(raw_input("Your number:- ")) It might help you.

Second this, num is being entered as a string, convert to to an int. 
Thanks a lot m8
I have my doubts when the first book is named "Python Interviews".
Hello. diveintopyhon3 is the best one. I created site for that. https://red-eyed.github.io/diveintopython3/
?
Downloaded it and bought the book a week later. Just can’t read from a screen:-)
Subtle flex
How about running in a container using this: https://labs.play-with-docker.com
You might also want to check if the input was valid =)
Google colab?
This is mad awesome! Teach me senpai! Take me in as a disciple!
Can you tell me what the advantage was of doing the course and book, as opposed to just doing the book? I'm just starting the book and wondering if I should pick up the course as well.
How did you find the course + book as opposed to just the book?
Hey, have you ever figured a way to integrate pylint from docker?
Pakt are generally regarded as rubbish.
That's Py2 code you've written. OPs script must be Py3, otherwise `input()` would have already returned an int instead of a string. Py3 is `num=int(input("Your number:- "))`
Use CFFI then move to PyPy for even more speed
365 days to go.

Huh? Why isn’t PyPy python? Lots of people use it, it runs python code including NumPy and SciPy.
Thank you. 
I use [milksnake](https://github.com/getsentry/milksnake). It_works_; it works on stable Rust (PyO3 does not), it works automatically across Python versions (rust-cpython was a bad time when I tried this), and it's just a pypi package with little boilerplate required. [Here's one of my projects that uses it](https://github.com/saethlin/rust-lather). There's some fun backstory to milksnake: https://youtu.be/zmtHaZG7pPc
[r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/) What you are looking to do is referred to as slicing.
Homework? Search Google for python string slice or index.
hmm you could do for name s = “name” print(s[0]) print(s[1:3) 
Automate the boring stuff with Python
&gt; So, what is the way to go? It probably depends what you actually want / need: ctypes/cffi lets you call a relatively generic library through the C API so the Rust part is independent of Python (can be called from other languages and the like) but needs to expose a truly C semantics API, and Python-side glue code is non-optional. Using rust-cpython/pyo3 you're creating a Python module, so the Rust bits will only be callable from Python (unless you have one generic rust codebase and one "bindings" codebase), the Python side is optional (if everything fits in the native side) and you have a richer native-side API (you can manipulate Python objects in Rust).
They are downvoting you because they don’t want you to help him because it’s not “r/learnpython” it’s honestly sad people are like this...
Oh, that’s pretty stupid 🤦‍♀️ 
Replicating the work here http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018_workshops/papers/w41/Ye_Recognizing_American_Sign_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf Most of what I'm doing at the moment is builed tools/wrappers for numpy/cv2/plot libs and testing it out with jupyter notes. But after i get comfortable and confident that I've understood their methods ill then replicate it.
link?
Just search the Name of the book in English. The author himself has a site with the whole book and YouTube videos on each chapter
alrighty, thx

I found this online when I was figuring out how to open stuff with the web browser. Didn't end up using Selenium (as the author showed), but the book is a great resource. :) 
I just think about all the stuff I hate at work...several ideas from that so far
Last year I started to read it on internet and have up. I usually learn by reading books. But this might be helpful, I didn't know it existed thanks! 
Python is for geting stuff done. You've gotten used to solving meaningless small puzzles hat are irrelevant to the problem at hand. It is a different mindset for Sure, especially if you enjoyed that. I didn't so the change was easier. And you should largely not learn modules, Kurt look it up when needed. It's fine. 
Thanks ! That worked :)
You can use PyCharm IDE from JetBrains. I work in it and it's very simple and so to say "comfortable" work in it.
Thanks for the description. I'm going to try out implementing this because it seems quite useful.
Just Python and Pygame.
different person replying here, but I found www.codingame.com type of websites great for making learning "fun". As for wanting to feel like you're making something and/or something "useful" I'd suggest the book "Automate the boring stuff with Python", it's purely teaching by example and the examples are pretty grounded (one is writing a script to rename a bunch of files at once).
Super Potato Bruh is the only one packaged for Linux, but I’m pretty sure the source should work on Linux for all of them.
Are you asking for tutoring? xD
yeah fix your keyboard first
Just got mine too! I've done some rubbishy projects but wanted a more solid grounding.
I just did the course and I loved it. Al is a fantastic teacher.
Getting ready to do 1.x release for my productivity tool [https://github.com/imomaliev/ptrepl](https://github.com/imomaliev/ptrepl), just created post [https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/abj3v0/rfc\_ptrepl\_turn\_any\_bash\_command\_into\_repl/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/abj3v0/rfc_ptrepl_turn_any_bash_command_into_repl/) to get some feedback on it
Let me know how the book goes, also new to coding and thinking about which books to order.

maybe :0 , you should start making video tutorials for these :D
The Humble bundle website regularly have sets of Python ebooks on sale. May be worth checking out. 
I was suprised how short it was.
A little work -- slowed down for the holiday break -- on my toy programming language, created with Python and LLVM: https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang You can pull the repo and run the demos at any time, although there may be bugs if you try to do anything more ambitious than that. (Sorry, it's still only Win32 only, but the project is architected to be portable.) Movie demo (slightly outdated, but still useful) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vZ4oFCFOl8 Most recently: Did some more work on the reference-counted memory management system for objects.
Start with the book, if you start struggling with the concepts then look into the videos. Sometimes the same information in a different format can help a lot.

great book
It's a fun book. I have it on my shelf. 😁
Ugh, that book. You should read the headlines and not the content, save yourself some time.
This sub is a meme.
I haven’t found any projects, I’m new to programming and I know the basics of python but I have no real applications to apply my new found knowledge to. Honestly I really just wanna find something to work on. A project where I can just sit down and code for hours to finally get some real world experience, Something where I can play some music, open up an IDE and write some code for hours. And hopefully at the end. Make something neat. I just don’t really know where to start. If anyone has any advice I’d be happy to hear it 🙂
I have a task for you, make an automated Instagram bot
Dynamic programming is about breaking a complex problem down into small and simple parts i.e. "divide and conquer" and it's very much a useful method in programming today. The guy you replied to sounds like a frustrated comp sci student 
I've been using automate the boring stuff, but I haven't used fluent python yet. What are the general prereqs for it in your opinion?
How did they change your life? Serious question, I'm curious what you did with python and if you used it for personal projects or professionally. Also: I assume you liked the books, how are they compared to each other? 
What kind of things did you make?

How did they change your life? You get a job? Hobby? Win over a date by sitting on them to look taller?
Nice, are u planning to launch these games commercially?
Not much to be honest, it is for beginners and python itself is already a good programming language for learners. IMO, the books provides a lot of content but it's also slightly swift at the same time. I recommend some YouTube videos to go with it, they'll help greatly in explaining the little parts. Also, if possible, although not needed, when you'll be working with more complex programs, knowing how to make flowcharts and pseudo code would help a lot to work out the logic of the program to prevent a semantic error. Just have fun and don't force yourself.
I used it personally first then transitioned to professional. I have a back ground in real estate. So before I was paying for a lead source and a marketing company. It wasn’t until I picked up the python books to master the code. I originally picked it up to build on to my Coding knowledge but one swift through, I went on to learning how to pull real estate deals and leads from top sites. Then I compile it to an excel sheet to automatically package them together to be one of the first people on a deal! It saved nearly $2000 a month in marketing and data management! Automate the boring stuff focuses more on using python for practical purposes like using openpyx1 or selenium’s webdriver to navigate the web. While Fluent dives more in to formal syntax to full grasp the concepts in python 3. Some of the things they dive in deep about are object-oriented idioms, data-structures, control flows, and understanding how metaprogramming works They both go over the simplicity and give a crash course, but Fluent may be a little overwhelming for people who are new to programming.
I am working on [GoNevis.com](https://www.gonevis.com) blogging platform to implement commenting as guest and blog migrations tools.
I have 0 experience with PyPy but for the past week I’ve been setting up CI pipeline for a foss project that requires its acceptance tests to be executed with various python versions - pypy and pypy3 included. Running these in azure and execution times with pypys’ and vanilla python is quite drastic. Normal test run is roughly around 13 minutes in Linux agent with 2.7.15, pypy takes about 15 and pypy3 25 minutes. On the other hand, IronPython and Jython are even slower but I don’t know yet how much cuz last run timed out in 2 hours :)
I used them to make things at work more efficiently, and cheaper by unsubscribing from services that I was paying too much money for.
The fact that this command is ambiguous is exactly why pip should fail quickly with a clear error and not do anything.
What's the issue? Who decided it should be nofixed? This is the second time I've heard of pip maintainers ignoring the [fail fast principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast). This is supremely irritating - this kind of thing puts people off python.
Numpy/scipy is your best bet. 
Instagram.
Well that’s awesome good work!
Awesome! Thanks for the details, really interesting. I can totally see how python is useful for that. I did a similar experiment last year to see if I can pull housing prices in my city to get a feeling of how to identify a "good" investment opportunity. I got settling offers for apartments and compared them to renting offers in the same area. Was a nice experiment even though it confirmed my feeling that the buying prices in my city are ridiculous atm, haha.
A calculator Money Saving Game (Got the idea from a Instagram post) A Billing System Instagram Bot Auto website Login (I used selenium for this, and make a quick gui with tkinter) Telegram bot (I’m going to need to learn more about machine learning to make it more interactive) Real Estate Deal Generator A simple login website (coolest thing, I use twilio’s text messaging to text me whenever someone signs up, and adds their data to a SQL database and updates a csv file that gets uploaded to a google sheet) Then from twilio text services, I made an automatic response software that texts my girlfriend with pre written responses. &gt; For example: &gt; if she texts “I love you”, respond “I know”. Or if she text’s “we need to talk”, respond “I didn’t do it”. Or if any where in the text “Netflix” is mention in any case, respond “I love Netflix, want to Netflix and chill?” Now I want to do something with web development and packaging bigger software with emerging technologies.
How do you read this kind of books? In front of the computer and inputing the codes or in same peace places like train and read as a normal book? I just curious due to a difficult to read paper books in front of pc. I am studing python too, by the way. Thanks
One of them was. https://store.steampowered.com/app/951360/Super_Potato_Bruh/ Although I recommend getting it [here](https://cmlsc.itch.io/super-potato-bruh) if you're interested since it comes with a Steam key *and* source there.
Just to second what you said about Fluent: it's a great book, well written with good content. But, definitely not for beginners - it even says this in the book itself!
Awesome!! I have just got the automate the boring stuff course on udemy. I’m going to start that tomorrow my plan for 2019 is to become fluent “so to speak” in python.
I ment in comparison of automate the boring things, automate is better for beginners. Thank you, I’ll fix that and edit it.
Fluent python is good, but definitely not for beginners. You could get by with knowing a large part of what it talks about, because some of the concepts are around the details of certain things in python. It's good if you want to go from "knowing how to use python" to "knowing python" if that makes sense?

I sat in front of a computer to code from the book. But mostly for concepts, I read it normally until I found something that got an idea for. Most of my skills stemmed from jotting notes on my phone and then watching YouTube videos and forking GitHub repositories and adding comments to each line to explain to my future self what each one does. 
I love seeing these books with bends and folds. Shows you that you actually used them! Hope your python endeavors are going well!
I learn python using fluent python. it's really good for teaching you the object-oriented Miss of Python and the python object model. These may be advanced topics for some beginner programmers. I think if you already have some knowledge of python the fluent python book is the right way to go.
Were you able to absorb much of the material in fluent python? You are a beginner programmer correct?
Yeah, I am not a beginner programmer, I have programming experience in HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. But I was new to python. So I started learning python by watching YouTube programming videos back in June, then I brought the books and worked up from there. 
Great books but there is a huge gap in skill level between Automate the Boring Stuff and Fluent Python. I would argue Learning Python is a good companion and next step after Automate. 
Cool just curious. I read fluent Python and I was wondering if new programmers were able to absorb its material that I don't think the question applies to you because you have previous experience
I have those in epub format hope they'll also change my life in 2019
Yeah, since we’re never really told about the practical applications of the concepts we learn in CS.
As someone else who discovered Python and coding in general in 2018, congratulations to you my good sir! I know how exciting this can be/is
Oh sweet, yea I'll have a look. Cheers! 
One of the freelance jobs I do is take government reports and make them ready to import into InDesign. Python saves me a LOT of work.
It’s a transformer. 
Same I’ve tried reading it on a screen but it just doesn’t work out. 
I can't even run the command manually in the terminal. The only way I can run test is with the command "python setup.py test". Can you please putup a project with https://pyscaffold.org/en/latest/index.html, and tell me what would you run to test it from the root directory?
With all the blockchain hype lately...can someone explain *why* you want to use blockchain? Outside of the obvious, "I'm a financial/lawyer institution and I need to publicly record transactions in a way that can't be modified". For the vast majority of cases, I just don't see it actually being useful.
Also, why would you `l = len(I) - 1`? The last `print` would just be `print(i[1:-1])`
And you blindly believed it would work. Did you even notice the last 20 releases they did? Do you really need to be on the latest version of pip? You should verify every package that you update that it will work if breaking your deployment is an issue. If you don’t care, maybe it’s broken for a few days, but no harm.
Ye true, I was in the middle of a party when I wrote it so wasn’t really thinking 🤷‍♀️
*alas: an expression of grief, pity, or concern.* Anyway, I just got a drone (Tello), and I've also been thinking how neat it'd be to have an API to it... 
Immutability of data is just one side of it. The blockchain allows decentralization and transparency of data as well. Decentralization is primarily considered the fundamental feature of the blockchain. Instead of having centralized silos who have all the power over the data, it is instead distributed across a wide area network.
Alas was used for my concern that it appears compatible out of the box with Python2 and I had to reverse engineer it for Python3. Anyway, thanks 
I had done a minor amount of Java coursework prior to this, but had never built a complete project from scratch before.
And I’m ok with him being an ass because I don’t read his rants. Even better, he’s working on making a good package. I dunno, maybe he’d be nicer if he felt people weren’t attacking him or they funded his project.

Fluent python comes after "Learning Python (O'Reilly)" if you are looking for the order. (In terms of difficulty only). "Learning Python" is for Beginners and "Fluent Python" is for Intermediate-Advanced Learners
Go fuck yourself asshole.
You literally could not install pip you patronising piece of shit. Not just unable to update it, you couldn't install any version of pip.
You are comparing apples to oranges when looking at the times of these two code snippets. You are adding in a lambda function where one is not needed. a = [x*x for x in range(10) if x%2==0]
Thank you for recommending these books. I think I'll buy them. This semester I will take classes in Python and Object Oriented Java. I have to think logically and I still have many difficulties in this area.
I agree lexical scoping is more intuitive, and I'm not sure why that's not in effect with classes and methods(you say there's very good reasons, I don't know about them). I don't strongly disagree with you, I just think adding a new construct with a different behavior to existing similar constructs would be perceived as confusing. 
Tests are a pain point with PyPy cuz stuff does not run long enough typically to warm up the JIT, we usually see 50% slowdowns. The difference between 2.7 and 3.5 is strange, can I take a look?
I feel the same way! Too many distractions on the computer. 
Happy cake day :)
Automate the boring stuff is a pretty good book. I've heard (read actually :) that the author has plans for a 2nd edition. Fluent Python is supposed to be an intermediate--advanced book though. It's on my list. I wouldn't say it's a good second book though. I'll know for sure once I finish. The use case you've mentioned is interesting :)
Just don’t use python 3.4
I'm a complete novice, and I'm determined to learn a programming language this year. Preferably becoming comfortable within 6months. What is the true power of this language python? I'm interested in using it with finance (professional and personal.)
Ok. But why is the first one faster? And when would I use a lambda function inside a list comprehension? 
People were never attacking him until he attacked people. People had constructive criticism towards his package. Instead of taking it as it was, he took it as insults towards him personally. That's nobody's problem but his own. But then he decided to attack the community because of it. And there he falls. Read his rants or not, he has a history of horrible behavior. The rant is the straw that broke the camel's back.

Wait, people charge $2000 a month to scrape real estate sites? Which software is that? 
No, $2000 for real estate scrapping and marketing. These were a collection of services we were using.not just one.
"Automate The boring stuff" is kinda basic and very superficial. Doesn't have enough depth on the subjects. "Fluent Python" is just ok. None of them are life changing really.
You miss the point. It’s what you do with it, that makes it revolutionary.
Hilar
Then it's you who changed your life, the books aren't life changing. They are ok books at best.

At what point would you recommend *Fluent* for a hobbyist scientific developer? I finished *Automate the Boring Stuff* long ago and recently spent 4 months' worth of Sundays doing data science / machine learning (sklearn) for fun. Now I'm trying to figure out whether *Fluent* is the right next step for me. --- /u/tycooperaow
Are these open source projects on GitHub? I would love to check your code out! I am currently learning the language as well 
Both wonderful books to work through. Also, does this mean I’m not the only one who can’t keep the rubber bottom on the 3-hole punch?
Well that's a very broad question so you're unlikely to get a very pointed out specific answer. Nonetheless, I'll take a stab. The power of python is its flexibility and expressiveness. It is a well crafted, well documented, well supported language that can be easily pressed into service for a large range of different tasks. Python is easy for beginners to write. Thanks to well written and sensible coding guidelines (e.g. PEP20) most available Python code is easy to understand and learn from. You can write short programs in Python that do a lot. Those programs nonetheless are generally easy to read and to comprehend. There are other languages that are better for particular niches. Python probably isn't the best language to use to write an operating system, a 3D rendering engine, or a rocket control system. Those tasks require specialist tools. If you want to write a web application, a mobile app, a desktop utility, or you want to do some data analysis, make a game, or many other tasks, it might be the most straightforward and least frustrating tool to put in your belt.
This build for example: [https://rasjani.visualstudio.com/opensource/\_build/results?buildId=168](https://rasjani.visualstudio.com/opensource/_build/results?buildId=168) .. down in the list you can see lin\_pypy2 &amp; lin\_pypy3 jobs, click either and you will see a finished list of tasks. There's task for running acceptance tests and there's like 10 minute execution time difference between 2 &amp; 3. If you need to reproduce locally, atests folder of robotframework has pretty easy to follow instructions..
Sorry for the delay. But perhaps you know. Indeed.com doesnt seem to be the best place to look for a job. Where would you suggest looking 
Looks interesting. It'll be nice if you could create the config file on the first launch instead of crashing. Even after creating the config file, I'm not able to launch it. I have filed a github [issue](https://github.com/imomaliev/ptrepl/issues/20). 
You heard right. Second edition is out in June I believe. 
If you are working with Python 3, use the PyPDF2 library, not PyPDF4. PyPDF4 has compatibility issues with a lot of PDF documents. I'm pretty sure they are separate forks of the same project anyway, and what works with one appears to work with the other with little or no changes in code.
I just picked up one of these books to improve my real estate performance! Glad to hear you’ve had great success with it, and it’s comforting to know I’m on the right track. Have any tips to share when first starting to learn?
I made a flask app that allows a user to enter the url of a YouTube playlist and have the total length of the playlist displayed for them. It's all base html now so if anyone has any css pointers feel free to let me know.
Ah if it was just one company I'd take the next 2 weeks off and build an open source tool to do exactly what they're charging people $2k a month for. 
Step debugger: What is in `args` and `kwargs` at the moment the TypeError is raised? Sure sounds like a named `tzinfo` argument is being passed in `kwargs` while an 8th-position `tzinfo` argument is being passed in `args`. A diff of the datetime module between versions might answer _why_.
Just a heads up. The Excel section of his book is obsolete now. it will not work. Neither will the web scraping part of it. I know he mentioned he is going to update it at some point though--not sure if that has happened yet.
Why did you prefer those books over something like codecademy? Just wondering. Just started python and i doubt if books are more efficient/fun or if an online course is gonna help me more.
Can anyone please tell me what the heck “automate the boring stuff with python is? (And where I can find a free pdf of it ;)
Do you have pytest installed?
Thanks!
You should have Python on Ubuntu out of the box. Python 2 should definitely be there, and likely Python 3 as well. If it's not, `apt install python3` should do it.
I'm not sure what changed in 3.7, but there's a bug in your ADT class that's always been there that 3.7 is hitting for some reason. This code: print(ADT(2018, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, datetime.timezone.utc)) Will throw the same exception in 3.6. Basically, you're adding a named parameter to match the positional parameter I'm passing in. If you change the tzinfo check in your ADT constructor to this: if 'tzinfo' not in kwargs and len(args) &lt; 8: kwargs['tzinfo'] = datetime.timezone.utc It'll work. Doing it without the magic number is an exersize left for the reader.
If you have Py3-ified this lib, I'm pretty sure they would appreciate if you posted a pull request with the changes.
I got most of it, but I’m still seeing some errors. I have to play around with it a bit more and do some testing prior to committing anything to the community. 
Yes!
Can I give you TeamViewer?
Is the standard Python IDE not available on Ubuntu then? How would I find that?
for an close to intermediate , which one you would recommend studying first.? 
In general you should use your package manager to install what you need on Linux. It will keep things up to date for you and warn you about incompatibilities and potential config conflicts. Until you get the hang of things I would suggest you avoid trying to install things manually. 
Sorry, I'm nowhere near my computer right now :(
Do you mean IDLE? Try `apt install idle3`.
I have, but that is the ego of open source. Language barriers tend to make very coarse comments. Unless you go out of your way to be nice, you’re going to be misread. If you can’t text or email your SO a criticism without being misunderstood, you don’t have a chance on the internet when people aren’t trying to be gentle. Getting a message like why did you do it like x is taken as an insult. If you’re wondering, I do run an open source project, so I’m very aware. My technique for difficult people is to ignore them. It’s also why you don’t write blog posts or badmouth similar packages and post that to reddit. That invites criticism.
Then you should be able to run the command. You can also define the command as "python setup.py test". Any command can be used. 
Python is preinstalled for most distros and is easily installed if it's missing
I just watch the videos and if you need help with anything then look at the book or watch another video about that subject. That’s just what I do. Also the book can be taken around and read and when you come back to your computer you can either continue from where you left off in the book or go over those chapters in the video. 
I will go crazy.
 (lambda x: x*x)(x) WTF why? /r/learnpython
Yeah I've spent an hour messing around and I think I need to step away from Linux and Python on Linux until I understand it better. 
:D Don't give up. You know where is the mechanism to run commands. That's half way to success. Now you have to figure out why pytests can't be run and fix it. 
Well they run fine when I do "python setup.py test" but when I do pytest/ tests in the same directory, it says that a file from tests/ can't import the module that's being tested, which is in /src/program, I must make it believe it's CWD is ../ somehow, I'll read https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/customize.html maybe it helps.
Just for another point of reference. I read programming books both ways. I read them at night and focus on concepts not letting myself get bogged down in code. Then I do one of two things. Spin up a Dev environment and do some more specific exercises or build some concepts into a branch of an existing project. Or I use the book as a reference book for an existing project.
If you're accustomed to using Windows you can try enabling [linux subsystem for windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). That'll let you open a real linux terminal and install linux packages and experiment without needing to leave your usual environment.
ITT: people that have python proficiency and trying to pry out what OP did with the language to see if they can make money from it too y’all make it too obvious, chill.
This isn't a language barrier. This isn't miscommunication. He got compliments, criticism, questions, and suggestions, for pipenv. People weren't being difficult. They were being first time issue-contributors and being told to "get out" simply because Kenneth heard something he didn't like. They were told they were not worth his time, nor any feather's weight of mental capacity. If these people were incessant, I'd give him a pass. But they weren't. If these people were rude, I'd give him a pass. But they weren't. If this was a rare occurrence for him, I'd give him a pass. But it wasn't. He has a history of egotistical, narcissistic behavior. He puts *himself* as some God simply because he created requests. It is absolutely disgusting. And then he decided to say "listen, I may be wrong, but I wasn't in the wrong. It was caused by my BPD". BPD does not cause people to act in this way. He used his illness as a scapegoat and it sets back *years* of progress torwards accepting people who have such ailments. I don't care if you run an open source project. You repeatedly say this on this subreddit but then never link it-- many times you don't even respond after people ask you to link it. Whether it be because you don't want to doxx yourself or not, it doesn't matter, because if you truly behave in the way that Kenneth has, you are part of the problem.
Codecademy is a bit 'bite-sized' in its delivery. You do a series of small exercises and that's about it. This is a good way to get a basic handle on syntax and control flow, but digging your teeth into projects like those in AtBS and learning to deal with smells and bugs in the process is how you become something like a "real" programmer. Note that this isn't to say that *books* are better than *online courses*. There are online courses which will teach well via projects (eg programarcadegames.com, which I *highly* recommend), and books which are shite (eg Learn Python The Hard Way). I'm just talking about the specific resources you mentioned.
Do you recommend these books for a complete beginner I’m currently learning python and it’s my first programming language I have a background in IT but want to eventually become a programmer Any advice?
Do you have any projects or goals in mind when learning python? What you're describing sounds fairly common where people try and learn the language itself and not necessarily apply it to something. A lot of concepts won't click till you start using them in practice, and I highly recommend finding a project to work on.
Empty iterables (lists, strings, tuples etc...) are False when evaluated as a bool
Thank you for your kind and informative respons. Would like to give you gold. But i am just a broke college kid.
AtBS for complete beginners. Also r/learnpython. It's a fucking awesome place.
It's a beginner tutorial for learning Python, focusing on practical projects. You can find a free pdf on the internet very easily. Googling is a fundamental skill for programmers ;) Also: r/learnpython.
Just bought “Learning Python“. Hope it is good.
Depends what you mean by intermediate. The content of AtBS is offered free online, find it and skim through it to see if it will be useful to you. Also: r/learnpython.
They've actually got some posted now. 
Thank you. I’ve been programming in python for a few years (mostly doing algorithm challenges). Would you recommend this book to someone like me? I mainly do penetration testing and the name of this book is very alluring for my kind of work ;)
what you mean why? I was curious to which was faster
No problem, reddit gold ain't worth anything much to me anyway. Wouldn't have made the comment if I weren't happy to offer it freely :) By the way: r/learnpython. Make it your new home and family. It is a wonderfully active and helpful community.
Intermediate means , I started python 6 months ago. And really looking forward to learn more content and Iam feeling to read a paper book and these two have been come across in many Reddit posts as well. Thus I was asking which one can be considered step 1 among these two in order to understand more about python. 
I'd recommend skimming through the content, which is offered online for free, to see what you think. I imagine penetration testing would be a little specialised compared to the stuff that AtBS focuses on, but it will get you comfortable with using libraries and modules generally, which I'm surely would be at least indirectly helpful to your use case.
Thank you! I appreciate this. Actually all that you mentioned in the last paragraph is on point to what I'd like to do.
Working on a shell program that was originally supposed to copy BaSH. Ended up as more of a Ubuntu BaSH clone. https://github.com/SomethingGeneric/PyNix
The book is mostly online at https://automatetheboringstuff.com/, and truthfully you could wget the website, import the toplevel index.html into Calibre, and convert it to PDF or ePub. I think it's worth giving Al Sweigart some ducats though if you can.

Leads for what? 
Fluent python made me really fall in love with the language. 
I'm curious about your schedule. Did you sit down and plow through these in a week? Spend an hour every day? How did you carve out time?
Not trying to be a jerk, but how long ago you started doesn't really say anything about how much you know and what you can do. You need to divulge what you know and what you suspect you need to know, or what your main goal is, to get specific advice. If you're comfortable with types, functions, classes, list comprehensions ets, and importing and using libraries and APIs, AtBS might not teach you much about the language as such. But if your goal is to automate stuff, like scraping websites, manipulating spreadsheets, reddit bots etc, and you're not sure how to go about it, AtBS would be very useful even if you do know those structures and syntaxes. I haven't read Fluent Python, but I gather it's more of a deep dive into the syntax, semantics, favoured idioms, and inner workings of Python.
*Fluent Python* picks up where a lot of the more introductory texts and resources on the web leave off. It also covers a lot of stuff that is unique to Python and the Python way of doing things. I often dip into it and find concepts in the book that can help me make my code a lot more succinct and efficient in terms of memory and execution. I've avoided enumerating all the topics covered as the table of contents is pretty detailed. (Try the 'Look Inside' feature on Amazon rather than the O'Reilly website.) Would definitely recommend it if you've got the basics of programming under control.
probably change to a javascript based one. If you already know and use python and your intention is to focus on the frontend (mobile friendly) you can improve your site and skillset a lot. For example Vue.js or React based one's might be a pretty modern option. This will give you many more options in the future for any programming problem you might have. Python3 and Javascript are a strong foundation.
Class! LOL.
Wow! Very cool. Very nice looks.
Python is really starting to take off in finance. Especially when you combine it with some of the data science and machine learning libraries that are out there.
Has anyone read these books and know if they are actually any good? I've read plenty of bad programming books in my time, including a bunch sold on HB.
You're a good man! I'm not going to li,e I would've taken the next 2 weeks off, built it and charged $1k a month!
I have the book on the left, as well as "Doing math with python" But thanks to this post I might actually crack it open haha. I'm embarrassed by all of the books I have and haven't read.
The question is, does your misses know you have this set up? "Babe I'm sorry but it's not working out. I love you but every night you come home from work and either sit in front of your PC or just watch Netflix. We never do anything anymore and you never listen to me. I'm sorry to have to do this by text but I can't even get through to you in person anymore. I'm sorry it had to be this way." "I love Netflix, want to Netflix and chill?" "Goodbye"
Should I look to focus on those as well??? Or will python lead the way?
Haha, unfortunately that response would send out! 😂 Without a proper machine learning or neural network having a database and memory to learn how to respond to certain messages according, then it would send that out regardless. 😂 
Thank you! I’ll keep at the push!
Valid question. I heard from several friends studying CS and being involved in programming that 90% of Packt books are poorly written. Better invest in O'Reilly books.
override QWidget's closeEvent callback did the trick for you, thank you!
I don't think the book is all that outdated, because the libraries it covers don't change at the same pace as say, front end web technologies. The thing I find really helpful about the book is the number of libraries it makes you aware of. I was often thinking to myself "Wow! I never knew you could use Python to do that." But it acts more as a pointer to these different libraries, giving the code for a few simple use cases, rather than as an in-depth reference. To flesh out the simple use cases, you'll need to start googling the reference materials for each library. And in doing that, you'll discover the more up-to-date material anyway. 
By mobile friendly, my initial thinking was to have different CSS or something for mobile users. My day job leans toward scientific computing where C/C++ and Python with SciPy/NumPy cover my needs. No real need or desire to learn JavaScript unless I’m missing something.
Thanks for the insight. :)
In C, or any lower level language the how is often as, or more important than the why. When you need to manage everything, it is all extremely important. Being efficient with algorithms and memory management isn't a secondary concern, it's a requirement for stability and a working application. Python, on the other hand, abstracts that business from you. The how shifts from that base foundation to the bigger picture logic flow. It was very odd going through that shift initially but eventually felt liberating in a way. I could focus on what I needed to do, and the how was just logical flow at that point. Sure algorithms, efficiency, proper context management are still critical, but in a totally different way. You still are a problem solver, just need to understand the problem doesn't require you to build the roads and scaffolding before you create the city. 
&gt; Why are all the values being squared? I tried to insert only the evens? All values you put into it are checked if they are even or not, and the even ones get squares and put into the list. That works in both examples. Nothing wrong here. You talk about being faster but dont give any times...
It is only slightly faster for minimal list sizes, for n=100 the list comprehension is already 50% faster in my tests
This is super ugly code. The lambda is uneccessary.
Yes sorry that is what I meant. I guess my question is whether there is a neat install package for all this on Linux like I can do on Windows where I just go download the latest version and install it--and everything is there. &amp;#x200B;
The fastest I could come up with is this: ```python %%timeit [x*x for x in range(0,10,2)] ``` 849 ns ± 49.8 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)

Thanks guys, that explains it. Will see if I can find the change in 3.7 and report back
Thank you all for the references!
!remindme 3 months. 
Hi ! My primary interest in python is to do data science and get good grasp of web frameworks like Django and Flask. Can you suggest which one I should buy? Any advice on how to approach the book would also be appreciated ! #python #datascience
Where would the tutorial on the official Python website place? Would it be a substitute for the ‘Learning Python ‘ book?
What if we don't already know and what to find out 'why'. Lets test and find out, shall we? Ask question, right? 
Multiply by 1. 1
Omg I feel so stupid now. Was looking for a operation of some sort, instead of looking at the numbers themselves 
The factor 0.1 represents the *increase* in population; what is the factor that represents the new population after the increase? Is it higher or lower than 1.0?
Higher 
About 9 months I think. I’ve only made scripts that help scrape data at work. Never played with web or other techniques. No, just requests! Didn’t realize that there were others :o think requests was the first module that came up during my research. 
I've NOT read those but I have other books and videos from Manning. The ones I have all purchased have been really well done. Hope that helps.
Congratulations on your purchase of a ~~completely secure and obviously unhackable flying wifi router~~ drone.
So they had a bug? It happens. Your system should be more fault tolerant. Saying that doesn't make me a piece of shit.
Alright man just be careful! In all seriousness, thanks for sharing everything. Automate the Boring Stuff seems to be highly praised here but I'm always struggling for some actual real world examples but your comments about using it for Real Estate have been really inspiring and so I'm motivated. Thank you! 
Thanks! I’m just as excited about it as you are.
Still new to Python, learning some basic data science // titanic data on [kaggle.com](https://kaggle.com) Gotta say Jupyter is pretty cool!
File that under "things the world definitely doesn't need"
Read the sidebar.
You just need to change the multiplier from 0.1 to 1.1. This is actually basic math!
Very cool, I personally love the requests library. I've done some messing around with others (namely urllib2) but it didn't feel nearly as intuitive. Have you looked to see if there are python modules for either the Discord API or Clash of Clans API? May be a nice way to refactor things to be more human-readable/testable. Happy coding!
Awesome job!

Last I looked Python isn't a great (or popular) choice for mobile app development. Java and Objective C are the languages for that purpose.
Yeah, I've bought books from Manning before. They're one of 3 publishers I like :)
Automate the boring stuff is the first programming book I read. I haven't stopped yet. Now I'm close to releasing my first Linux program
I just finished Automate the Boring Stuff, did you go straight to Fluent Python after?
Spend some time learning the language (I'd say work through 1 or 2 books or online courses) then try to build projects that you're actually interested in or think you could use.
I'm sure /u/alsweigart would like this feedback 
Yeah! That’s the man!

Really enjoyed the blog post and couldn’t agree more with what you had to say!
considering the "hassle" is typing two lines into the command line, just set up a virtual env
That's a fair comment. I think it depends on the type of application. For an application that depends on careful manipulations of the native interfaces, or one that is very performance sensitive, or particularly complex, I would agree entirely. On the other hand there are a number of Python frameworks that can target Android and iOS which are very reasonable for applications with reasonably modest requirements. For example, the Beeware and Kivy frameworks are suitable for these kinds of applications.
Can you give a general idea of how that works/what you're doing? The reason I ask is because I was under the impression that the majority of real estate sites if not all prohibited web scrapers.
Classics
If you're a complete novice, as you say, probably just stick to straight-up Python for now. Having an actual concrete problem to solve is always helpful when learning something new. Not sure what sort of finance you're in, but as an example, you could try writing some bond pricing code and things like that to get started. If you want to start dealing with large data sets and heavy duty statistical analysis, like multivariate regression analysis on historical prices for example, that would be the time to take a look at the data science libraries, including NumPy, SciPy and Pandas. And if you want to start looking for patterns in that data, say for a trading algorithm, that would be the time to look at stuff like scikit-learn, TensorFlow and Keras.
You nailed it. Now you can earn much more in real estate business which is already most paid job in many countries. 
What exactly is going wrong for you? Python is a virtual machine/byte code language so with some quirks here and there is basically the same on POSIX and whatever you consider MS Windows. Atleast with Windows and virtualenv setups, don't forget you need to add something like import os import sys sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.')) sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('..')) at the top of sphinx conf.py to add the project you are trying to document. Similarly, `sphinx.ext.autodoc` can help scaffold out documentation on any commented/documented def/class/module you reference.
You be surprised, I’m gathering from listing site a real estate site I used to get properties leads. Spent 2 hours to make one spreadsheet. Now I spent 4 hours to make one script now it collects data from each site. Yeah I heard about that, but I have not encountered that issue of web scraping rejection yet. When I do I think I have some Ideas around it
Definitely! It’s an extra source of revenue for the business!
Yes, trading algorithms is where I'd like to end up. But thank you for the assurance that focusing solely on python is enough for now!!! Many a times when you don't know what to expect, you try to prepare for everything.
I have a script running on a raspberry pi to pay my bills monthly for me. Whole thing is one single regular expression.
Standardizing user inputs for dates
you truly are a patronizing asshole that I would love to spit on.
You literally do not get it you dumb patronizing asshole. 
hi,im a hobbyist as well and am very curious as to how you prepared yourself to do data science / ML projects? what books / courses / videos did you take to get to this level? thanks!
i don't get why you're making excuses for shitty fucking coding practices in literally one of the most important pieces of Python infra.
Until it fails bot blocking. 
don't bother with this asshat, he just shifts goalposts and makes excuses for shitty behavior.
Lol yup
Real estate like houses on the market and etc.
Fluent Python is awesome, probably my favorite programming book. 
I don’t understand why o’Reilly mismatches the animals. It’s called Python, why not use a python as the animal mascot? They’ve done this for other animal-named topics as well. 
None, regex is a fairly basic pattern match. Anything I've automated properly uses lexing/parsing, antlr mainly.
Broadly interested, work in the mortgage side but as a back room tech person. Are your leads people who recently bought homes? Or are you looking for people thinking about selling?
Hmm the tutorial is not bad and can get you by. But Learning Python starts out with the basics, and thoroughly walks you through everything to include functions, decorators, exceptions, classes, etc. Fluent Python practically starts off with operator overloading, such as changing the default behavior of \_\_getitem\_\_. That is one of the last chapters in Learning Python. I honestly bought Fluent Python too early in my python journey and was glad to find Learning Python later on, which filled in a lot of gaps in my knowledge.
&gt; I don't care if you run an open source project. You repeatedly say this on this subreddit but then never link it-- many times you don't even respond after people ask you to link. &gt; &gt; Whether it be because you don't want to doxx yourself or not, it doesn't matter, because if you truly behave in the way that Kenneth has, you are part of the problem. They linked a pastebin that had a reference to this repo[0] which is probably what they keep referring to. https://github.com/SteveDoyle2/pyNastran
Great stuff to know. It is really useful.
&gt; I agree lexical scoping is more intuitive, and I'm not sure why that's not in effect with classes and methods https://docs.python.org/3/faq/design.html#why-must-self-be-used-explicitly-in-method-definitions-and-calls Lexical scoping is in effect in methods, but the instance and class themselves aren't searched when resolving unqualified names. That means that methods follow the same rules as external functions, and it means that you can inject a function into a class, turning it into a method, and it will behave precisely the same as if it were written as a method in the first place. Since Python 2.2, name resolution has followed the LEGB rule. (Before that, it was just LGB.) (Also, there are a few little twists to do with comprehensions.) Inside a class, methods created with `def` are just regular functions obeying the same rule. So inside a method, if you have a reference to some name: def spam(): x ... the rule says: - look for a **l**ocal variable "x" - look for a non-local "x" in an **e**nclosing scope (if any); - look for a **g**lobal "x"; - look for a **b**uiltin "x"; - raise NameError. stopping at the first step which succeeds. Currently enclosing scopes are only created by nested functions: def spam(): x # this is in the enclosing scope def eggs(): print(x) My proposal simply adds the rule that namespaces create an enclosing scope, just as nested functions do. Technically, that will mean that functions defined inside a namespace object will be closures, and if you want to re-bind the given non-local variable in the namespace scope, you need to declare it using `nonlocal`. I think that's a feature. &gt; adding a new construct with a different behavior to existing similar constructs With my rule, the new construct has *the same behaviour* as existing similar constructs: both closures and functions in modules. 
Okay great, thanks for the reply. Looks like ‘Learning Python’ should be my next resource then. Thanks again.

Hi what issue you are having if you launch it without config? It creates config file by default after first launch
**tl;dr at the bottom!** --- My background: I have a B.Sc. in Aerospace Engineering, which means I have some formal training in math but only up to the usual differential equations &amp; linear algebra. I also have ~5 years of professional experience in engineering. Before I did anything related to data science, I became interested in the field from what I read on various data science blogs. It was about two years ago that I read articles like [**this one**](https://flowingdata.com/2009/06/04/rise-of-the-data-scientist/) (written almost ten years ago!). Even in 2016, data science was already an established field and ML libraries for Python like `sklearn` (which came out in 2007) were already mature and extremely well-documented. I started with *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*. Between that and using Python whenever I could at work, I gained a baseline level of Python knowledge that gave me a starting point for working on my own projects. Eventually I wrote a basic script for pre- &amp; post-processing flight test data that I routinely got as raw CSV files which saved my company a lot of time/money. After that I looked for a meetup in my area that focused specifically on data science. Turns out my local university had one that met every weekend and which was a sort of free-form programming with the objective of performing data analysis. I found that working in a group really helped me pick up a lot of programming tricks that I would never have if I had stuck to learning on my own. It was also around this time that I started doing some exercises from [**Practical Business Python**](http://pbpython.com/) as a way to both a) get better at both Python, and b) learn data science concepts. --- # Resources **tl;dr** If you don't care about my background, here's a short list of everything I've used (and continue to use) in my "career" as a Python developer. 1. https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ 1. http://pbpython.com/ 1.

I have been coding in python for a few years now and I got pretty overwhelmed as well when I started. There are so many libraries and facets... now that I am comfortable in it I just remember a couple things. 1 everything is an object and 2 google the rest. Whatever project you’re working on there are a handful of libraries you could use. Just google some quick research and see which one has what you need and go for it. 
If it isn't clear, it doesn't matter if they run an open source project or not. I just made that first remark because he has been asked to link it many times across many discussions in this subreddit, whether in his favor or not, 9/10 times he stops responding, and other than that he skirts around actually sharing it, which personally makes no sense. Because if he's afraid of doxxing, his info is already either on Github or here. If he's afraid of something else, god knows what it is. But constantly referencing it to prove your weight in a conversation and then never proving it true is downright strange. Also, no clue what you're referring to with the pastebin link stuff. There's no comment on this thread with one unless it was edited out.
Not on Ubuntu. They split the official Python package into smaller parts since most users don't need the whole thing. 
I don't know why you're cussing. Also, get over it. It's open source and not your project. They had a bug. So what?
Yeah, you said that. I do open source. I don't have patience for this sort of BS.
I've met both authors and am happy to report they're both just as wonderful as their books.
I was working on something to pull images off inspirobots page and put them in a folder. Then while looking at other people's githubs, attempting my own program, and other things. I decided to just get a Chrome extension that downloads all images off a Google search and do it that way. My damn knowledge of how to Google things is taking away my desire to do things myself, or my own way.
The guy that wrote automate has the entire book free online. I’m taking his Udemy course now and I like it. Been more helpful than other videos I’ve watched. 
None that I haven't regretted.

Working my way through a dice game, hoping to eventually use Qt or Tkinter to build a UI framework for it. I've got most of the core logic finished. There's an underlying dice game framework I put together that should provide a good starting point for any dice game. Then I've got a Yatzhee clone with all of the logic needed to find things like "full house" and "straights". I'm cobbling together a console application now, with hopes to transform it to a UI application later.

Depends on what you mean, when you say "regular expression". If you simply refer to the module in Python's standard library, then, of course it has been often instrumental, but never the complete story. But, if you mean regular expressions in general (as in: associated automata), then there's a lot of things that it can deal with very effectively. I'll give few examples: 1. Description of a bring up (deployment) of a cluster of VMs. You can think about it as states and transitions. The initial state when you have no VMs, and then, on positive input (all conditions are met), you transition to the next state with a network created, on a negative input (network creation failed) you loop back to the initial state, and try again. If network creation succeeded, the next transition is to create shared storage, and so on. Scenarios like this one can be too complex to describe in words, but given as an automata diagram, makes it easy to follow. 2. Description of a complex system that processes post-trade reports through a report collection and archiving system. Like in a previous example, the system has a lot of rules, some of which assume certain order of operations (i.e. that previous rules were matched), and it makes for a good use of regular language to describe it, since it can either finish, or loop forever doing the same thing, but it cannot create new processes in the system. 3. Writing a watcher program for processing of `dmesg` logs. The format of the log is stateless: each line is (allegedly) independent of others, but they describe a system with a state. So, every time a particular action is logged, your system advances to a new state (or loops back to a state it already visited). Of course, regular language cannot describe everything you can see in this log, but you can have a non-trivial subset of it, which is also useful. In my case, I needed this for testing of iSCSI attached devices to figure out if they failed during the test: in particular, I'd need to find a specific line, but only if it was preceded by another line, preceded by another line etc.
Pakt books are usually pretty bad. I’ve returned a handful for being literal copies of online documentation and wikis 
It won't be up to date, if you use package manager, you will always lag behind, especially on something like Ubuntu, where they don't release a new version every few months. Your chances are better with, say, Arch, but even there you'd have to wait a few month to get the latest version, if you go through package manager route. Bottom line: package managers don't ensure you are up to date.
I'm not the one pissed off? There was a bug. Cry me a river.
yeah fuck you you shitty engineer. hope your shitty engineering doesn't kill someone someday.
&gt; A bug that would have been easily caught if they had done any testing at all. That you could have avoided had you not updated, which was totally unnecessary and potentially going to fail. You knew that. &gt; A bug that caused thousands of people unnecessary extra work on a Friday just to be able to install pipon a fresh box. Welcome to computers. Things change sometimes unexpectedly. Core python does it too. &gt; Your attitude of "meh didn't affect me and it's open source so whatever lol no warranties" is the fucking problem. No my attitude is you chose to use the latest, greatest, potentially buggy version and you got bit. You completely disregard your role in this and yeah, it's just it a bug. It's shouldn't be that big of a deal to the developer if you aren't paying them money. I test my releases for customers. My open source work doesn't go through the same rigor. &gt; You're a shitty software engineer if you don't see any issues with that. I'm an aerospace engineer who happens to code. I recognize that I have a duty to make my product work irrespective of code. I don't blame bugs on my dependencies. I blame my own lack of testing. Where's your duty?

That's why people have backups. There are 2 important statements: &gt;If you have data without a backup, then you don't have data From which follows: &gt;If you don't have a backup if your backup, then you don't have a backup For some weird reason however it doesn't go further than this. But it does branch a bit: &gt;If you don't have an offline backup, then you don't have a backup
If you're benchmarking python and php for speed, and not getting 200% difference, then you're not looking at the right picture. Neither of them is used for performance critical tasks. For that, people usually look towards Java, .NET, Go, or if the impact of performance is really critical: C, Rust, or if you're having fun for yourself then Nim. People should choose python or php or Node not because of speed, but because of its economic factors: what finds you more good cheaper developers in the area? Or for its ease of use for specific tasks. Nobody in their right mind will use PHP or JS for data processing, data science or AI, and very few would think to use it for a step up from bash. Also, very few rely on python for web Infrastructure. Just because you can drive a screw in fastest with a sledgehammer doesn't mean you should use a sledgehammer.

&gt; Why are all the values being squared? I tried to insert only the evens? What makes you think that all the squares are inserted? Did you inspect the value of the list? When I run your list comprehension code: py&gt; [(lambda x: x*x)(x) for x in range(10) if x%2==0] [0, 4, 16, 36, 64] sure enough, that's `0**2`, `2**2`, `4**2` -- only every second square is inserted.

Honest question: can R be used to automate things (other than data scrapes) similarly to Python? Or is it worth picking up Python for this?
I really want to know in what ways these two books are more exceptional that videos we see on youtube. No offense. I am just curious and maybe your answer may want me to buy those books.
You can replace al those open/close files with with open(file, 'w') as f: f.write(stuff) and the file will close automagically.

What is a report style system? I'm interested in writing games but never heard of that therm before and google doesn't help. 
Learning python is 1600 pages. You will probably burn out before finishing it if you try to read it from the start. It's a good reference book though.
Do you like games? There are many easy projects if you are interested. Maybe start with pong, snake or tetris.
You can replace all those open/close files with with open(file, 'w') as f: f.write(stuff) and the file will close automagically. Also use/declare # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- at the top of the script.
Oh cool I didn't know you could that thanks. Whats the reason for the declaration?
So you can change this long thing file = open("songlist.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") to this with open(file, 'w') as f: f.write(stuff)

 Hello!! Happy New Year :) This is vignesh. I have done learning on Tableau. Now I would like to step-in to the Python world. But I'm new to this. Can someone please guide me how to begin ? where to start ? any references from the scratch? Though we have many sources here to learn, but here is the something where we can interact with new buddies at real time hence it creates value &amp; confident. It will help me a lot &amp; very eager to kickstart immediately. Thanks in advance..
Are you suggesting PyPy would be faster than rust (or rust called from CPython)? I implemented an image compression algorithm in CPython and had to move to Cython in the end (hint: Don't! It's a trap! Seriously, do not.). Next time I'd either write it in Scala or in rust. Hence my curiosity in combining rust and python. Also: I do like static types. I heard good things about PyPy but it seemed a bit of a hassle to set it up with anaconda.
And you're importing urllib.request and requests. I can see you're only using requests get so remove import ```urllib.request``` and ```requests``` and replace them with... from requests import get 
so a CLI is a command line interface to a programme. you're mimicking it in a sense because you're running your application in a while loop and waiting for input from the command line. a CLI works differently. you interact with a program via commands, however it only executes when a valid set of commands are given. think of GIT's CLI. git add &lt;file&gt; is how you interact with GIT when adding a file. in your case you'd have ./main.py -- friend &lt;operation&gt;, where operation is ADD, DELETE or SHOW
A service less python database for flat files... like mysql for CSV's. I've worked with flat files on so many projects... as requirements (Not on purpose). I wanted a way to run regular queries against them without having to rewrite an import/export system every time. It's embarrassing, but I'm proud of myself. The lexing was the hardest part. The query system itself was pretty easy. It works from the cli for regular use in term, and of course in python. ## Links - https://github.com/chris17453/ddb - https://pypi.org/project/ddb/ 
```data = f.read().splitlines(True)``` can be ```data = f.readlines()```
In this instance I would not consider the '8' to be a magic number because positional arguments are a fixed feature of an API.

i love this. im an entrepreneur, and just starting to learn python. i LOVE the potential of python to automate my work, run things efficiently for my business. i think i can do something in the area of business intelligence to help me understand which merchandise we carry that’s moving fast, help keep track of loyal customers, check what competitors are doing, etc! OP: what’s the next step for you? stay in real estate and keep using python to “enhance” your work, or eventually get to a level where you can become a developer or data scientist? im always curious bec i think about this almost everyday

3 has been around for quite some time now and should be considered stable. Be careful when setting up your environment though, as 2.7 is still packaged with many OS. 
i am so excited with this field (data science/ML). i feel like im building rare skills necessary for the future! but im not sure if im gonna be content with using it to enhance my business, or become a full fledged data scientist (harder path for me)!

"Handle" is a C lingo, which, basically, means "pointer that has no type" (which is a lie, because it is of type `char`, probably, there aren't pointers of no type in C). The idea is that you use this pointer to point to some object, which you know very little / nothing about. In other words, you don't know the size and layout of the memory pointed by this pointer, only some other function that you can call with it knows that. This is an unfortunate consequence of defects in design of C language, where types only exist during compilation, but units (programs, libraries) need to communicate type information after compilation (when it was already erased). This is a usual cause of memory segmentation faults (because at some point someone will make an assumption about the layout of the memory pointed by the pointer, and will turn out to be wrong). However, in a context give, its meaning is expanded to "a key in some map managed by another entity", in case of Linux, the other entity is the VFS (Virtual File System). VFS, beside other things, has a table, where it keeps track of files, the keys into that table are called "file descriptors". So, the handle it is talking about is the file descriptor in that table. Probably an entry in `/proc` directory, though I might be wrong about this one.
Of course python 3. The only way I'd even entertain the thought of python 2 is if there was a library I had absolutely no choice but to use, and even then I'd work on getting it rewritten for python 3. In around a year python 2 is end of life: no updates *whatsoever*. Personally, at this point, when I find a library that's only python 2 I just don't even consider it an option for use. As this year goes on, there will be more and more libraries supporting only python 3 and not putting in time or effort in supporting a dead language. Windows XP still does exactly what it was designed to do and was once by far the most popular os, yet today it shows its signs of aging and isn't supported officially. Support by developers is steadily decreasing to the point where most software can no longer be updated. So today, would you rather install and use Windows XP because of what it used to be, or Windows 10 because of what it is now and the environment around it?
Bottle is great for small apps. Especially if you want to bundle the framework with it as opposed to having the dependency. It’s a single file but *surprisingly* powerful and we’ll made
Then you just turn to [using this python project](https://github.com/ecthros/uncaptcha) to defeat it
Use python or Rust really depends of the kind of project you are developing. If you want to use python I really recommend you the Python3. There are many tools that use python2 and that is why we see python2 so many times, but new applications should use python3 unless there are dependencies form python2.
I made fully functiomal instagram bot using BlueStacks on windows and pywinauto, but some features of pyautogui come in handy. 
You might even get by with a static-site generator like Pelican: https://www.staticgen.com/pelican
I’ll have to take a look at that sometime 
Yes, if you are developing the kind of project that you want to painlessly ship to a customer (rather than put in the one and only environment where you can be reasonably sure it will work), then you need to go for something that can be compiled into a single executable with as little dependencies on your system as possible: in other words, anything but Python.
That's a lizard, not a python, silly
Oh wow! You are amazing! Thanks I’ll play around with this.
Why promise newbies something unrealistic? The concept of being up-to-date isn't that difficult to grasp. I also disagree with "should use package manager" formulation. It should be "may" or "could", not "should". Linux is about being a true owner of the programs you run, this means, understanding how they run, and what they need. Ignorance, is the way of non-free software, which uses it as a tool to shake you down for more money.

Yeah. Automate the boring stuff is an awesome book. Helped me automate stuffs related to data entry and web scraping. Worth read. Taught me manu other concepts about Python as well and learnt some interesting modules. 
Too true! It’s one of The highly recommended ones
r/forhire and r/slavelabour or **ME**.
Hisss
Nothing is more stronger than the written word. Video are great as well, but psychologically it’s an extra level understanding by reading something and taking it into your own creation. They have automate the boring stuff for free on Amazon you can take a look at.
Thanks Dmarko!!!
I haven’t had much experience with Ruby for data scraping but if you can find a library that has that support to read sites and spreadsheets, then creating methods to extract that information, then that would work the same.

Thank you for the support! I’ll totally work daily on my programming endeavors!
Truth is, Ai Sweigart is a great technical writer. I’ve checked some of his other books as well (found them freely hosted on his website automocatetheboringstuff.com); and they’re great. One of books teaches about inventing games. He begins with small text games and RPGs. Really engaging book. Starting with simple Tic Tac Toe kinda stuff, and moving towards elaborate RPGs, and even intelligent AIs. Really enlightening. Another one takes it one level further with modules like pyGame and stuff. We could use these to write 2D and 3D games. Amazing, right. Remember those NES games like ASTEROID, and CONTRA. They were great, right. I personally enjoyed them a lot. I’m a 90s guy, I mean. So, we could even build these with Python. What a fortune!! I’m a Python enthusiast and Python continues to amaze me with its simplicity and concise nature. I could now think of building stuffs without worrying about the implementation all the time. 
+1 Reading something is often more better than just watching a video. Though some reading words are much more or less worse than others.
True, it’s comes down to personal interpretations. Mainly
I use VS Code
PyCharm IDE and VS Code :)
I know the book automate the boring stuff... what about the second one ? Does any one study python through the book ? What the advantages of it ?

Start with PyCharm, install and run. VS Code is good as well, but you have to configure the environment. I rather just use PyCharm.
These are really cool, already tried Lollipop Ninja and Whirling Blades!. I've been looking at the source code, what are you using for generating the levels? I mean those .txt files
Can anyone explain why the entire world is moving to Python but game development isn't? 
When you say library, then you are probably safe to assume the users of the library will have Python installed. Go with Python3, and see if there is a big request for Python2. In my experience, unless your code deals with a lot of strings, or some of the edgy stuff asyncio/multi-thread+process work, you can back port the code fairly easily. If you are building an application (cli or whatever) for non-Python developers, then your choice should start with 2.7. Yea, it sucks, but I had clients that refused to install Python3 for some stupid IT reason.
Yeah, Python is great in a lot of programs and development, but for the longest of time it’s not or hasn’t really been competitive in game development. Programming languages like C++/C# and JavaScript and Java, are still some of the most widely used languages in game development. 
Whirling Blades is procgenned. I wrote a level editor for Lollipop Ninja. It might be in the game files somewhere.
This is the blog post that opened my eyes to PyPy - doing a sobel transform in pure python (no NumPy) at frame rate from a web cam, eight years ago. https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/07/realtime-image-processing-in-python.html. PyPy works well with cffi. Of course the JIT cannot peek into the compiled shared object but there is minimal overhead when calling out to the function, unlike CPython which must unbox objects to native c types. As far as setting up with anaconda - it should be possible to add PyPy to conda forge but no one has picked up that gauntlet yet. The easiest thing to do is to set up a virtualenv with PyPy and do pip install from sources, at least on Linux where compiler support is built in.
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
I use Spyder, it is perfect when working in the science or data fields
Flask! Flask is really easy to get up and running.... 
Vim
I've used quite a lot of them and finally settled on Spyder. No contest.
Care to share the details on the money saving game? Genuinely interested.
Sublime text for 3 years, but i really wanna port to Vim :) . I've work with PyCharm and Atom they are nice as well but can be slowly at start in some OS/hardware.
Years ago, my first coding job involved automating spreadsheets for accounting and finance people. Automating the Boring Stuff was the very book I used. Fantastic book. Highly recommend it.
I want to develop an AI robot, do a double-layer internal chain website, and make a fully automatic script.
May as well recommend the newer version if you're going to recommend this. :) [Uncaptcha2](https://github.com/ecthros/uncaptcha2)
Why not try posting the challenge you're facing, here, on this sub? You may get some guidance that helps you smash the impasse.
I use pycharm with anaconda for env management
I've posted on about half a dozen forums including r/learnpython. It takes a lot of time to get answers (if at all) which don't get me much closer to my goal. I just jumped in at the deep end I think. 
Flask. Didn't even have to read past the title to answer this one.
Can you link to the learnpython thread? 
I currently use Wing, but that's just because the tutorial I did when I first started python used it.
[this is the most recent question I asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/abm8dl/how_should_i_locate_the_element_within_this_table/). I also used stackoverflow and the official python forum, both of which got 0 replies. 
PyCharm and Sublime Text. The former for heavy duty work (especially if there's a need for introspection and playing around with state), the latter for quick scripts, and for poking around. SublimeREPL's not too bad but it just keeps crashing on me.
Can you dump the HTML that the driver is seeing? I'd be interested to see if the element actually exists yet, as it look almost certain to be dynamically rendered after an AJAX call
I think you're right, because the table doesn't show up in page source or in table source. 
Flask should be perfect. By default, it doesn't provide much more than routing urls to Python methods and template rendering, but there are many extensions (Python libraries) such as Flask-login that you can import, set up with a few lines of code (if needed) and use. It works for bigger apps as well, but in that case you have to take care of project structure and architecture on your own, which might not be the best solution.
&gt; Misses rest of arguments in thousands of words. Relevant to python is the success in replacing Excel for many business users.
Every game I see made with python is 2D pixel art. Are there any games that are made in 3D? How about a library that allows for that?
fyi, I'm in the middle of a rewrite so this code may not be totally correct. Just for reference. :)
Just define it as a variable above the classes, outside of them. They should still be within scope. As long as you’re just reading the variables there should be no conflicts 
I'm a professional Python developer and even I think your statement is a huge exaggeration. Excel is humongous in enterprise and will continue to be so.
I love when I overthink these stupidly simple solutions. That'll do perfectly, thank you! Now lets say I have other classes in another file called Users. Is it acceptable to have a centralized file like config.py to house these variables so every file can access them?
It't not IDE
Using Emacs (+ `lsp-mode` for checking stuff). I have used (and quite liked) PyCharm in the past though.
Yeah that should do the trick well
true. a responsive css will do the job. this brings bootstrap4 css framework to middleman. which then offers you a ton of mobile friendly themes to choosenfrom. https://github.com/mattolson/middleman-bootstrap-template. the demo site is already a responsive blog. Just by the way I even think for numpy/scipy javascript might be a good addition since there are really great visualisation/ chart libraries available to visualize data. 
There are 3D libraries for Python. Look up Panda3D and Pyopengl.
Sublime Text
Well, Sublime and VS Code it's not an IDE too, they need some plugins to behave like an IDE. 
I’ve tried VS Code and PyCharm but they’re slow in my experience so when I tried Sublime Text, I stick with it. It’s a lot faster and it makes me so productive.
What they said. Flask is my go-to framework for small APIs.
I know, but OP specifically asked for IDE, just read the title. I myself, use VS Code which is enough for DS, but choosing IDE like PyCharm can make a difference for devs. Btw, thank you for downvoting the right answer. 
R is not Ruby.
IMO, you are modeling the objects wrong. Why does a token, server, or headers have to with being a GuildMember? What you need is a client lib, whether you write that your self or find an existing one. Then you can pass a reference to the instantiated client object into each class.
Do you specifically want to use MPI? Why?
The OP is asking what we like to use in our development environment in the description. I just give my answer. I'm not here to say what people should use. IMO, the OP must try every tool listed here and stick with the tool that he likes most.
Ah, okay. I thought it was my fault.
May I ask what websites you're scraping for real estate? 
Atom and VS Code
I think I know what you're saying. The original library I was going to use behaves that way. I'll reference that and see what I can do, thanks.
you can do it with pyspark
Apparently it's been down for nearly a week: [https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/3954](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/3954)
This is it.
because prof wants this method 
https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/3954
Atom and jupyter for data science.
Hey Code has been added to the blog
&amp;#x200B;
What would be a great comparison what you think
Hey code has been added
I'm sharing my very first project on github: https://github.com/idlehandle/Townhouse It's a very simple binary clock app, but I had fun making it.
I use Sublime text and the terminal. You can just use your favorite text editor frankly. If you want a full IDE then I'd recommend PyCharm.
If you have a python 2 request, have a talk with them about EOL, and if you must support both. You don’t get some of the fancy new features (others were backported), but it’s not hard.
DNS saying unknown host. Have you tried using a cached IP address?
Spacemacs 
EOL means nothing in enterprise unless there is money involved, like Oracle style. We still have java 1.2/1.3 running somewhere.
Use Thonny, it’s an IDE for beginners, pretty good
Just deprecate it. People use the wrong thing all the time.
Update: 0.4 released today, with improved feed sorting.

VSCode
Is the Fluent Python written for Python 2 or Python 3? I am only learning Python 3 at the moment
What about [https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pypy3.5](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pypy3.5)? This [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50550085/969122) makes it sound trivial to set up. I suppose I should have invested more time to give PyPy a shot. But boy did Cython sound promising "just add a few type annotations and you're golden". Hell no. And the more you go to that dark side of cython the more you lose all tool support. How does PyPy compare in that regard? Talking about profiler, memory profiler, line profiler, debugger? I'm on macOS btw.
Written for Python 3. Support for python 2 will soon be abandoned in few years
''' This is a multiline comment. '''
Python 3 is still accomplishing most of our business needs. My main hate, coming from 2.7, is how bytes and buffers are handled. In 2.x, everything was a string you could index. Fetching something at an index would return a single character. In 3.x you'll sometimes work with bytearrays, which return ints when you fetch an entry. And sometimes it's a byte string. And if you want to use them for anything, you'll need to encode or decode them. (But the str.decode in py2 is strictly superior since it can decode hex, base64 etc.) Having to always consider this Unicode support is terrible if you are trying to interface with hardware, as we do. We do a ton of operations on raw packet buffers, and it's so much more painful in 3.x. That said, all our libraries are supported, and the performance of 3.x is better overall.

Watch the indentation of your first line, but yes, this will work! 
Yeah, I had to edit it multiple times cause I'm on mobile and could get a new line, but you got the idea 
I use Emacs for everything that JetBrains doesn't have an IDE for. I tried setting up a nice environment for Python in Emacs but it didn't come even close to what PyCharm offers. I still keep Emacs open for Magit though :)
Oh okay thanks.
Visual Studio Code is my favorite at the moment. 
If you can get it on a student license (You can apply for this if you have a .sch, .edu or similar email) I would recommend PyCharm, otherwise I would recommend VS community. As someone who learnt solely using IDLE, I can assure you that the extra functionality these IDE’s provide is invaluable, especially when you move to bigger programs.
I definitely found Automate the Boring Stuff very helpful in the past. Is it worth buying or does the website already cover all of the topics? https://automatetheboringstuff.com/
if only there was a term for those fields that incorporated both those words
Pycharm for bigger projects, sublime for smaller scripts. Also a lot of Jupyter notebook/nano
Thanks all for the answers so far! It seems it boils down to "bite the bullet and cffi unless you need the tight integration of PyO3". And milksnake seems to make the former more bearable. Also PyPy. As usual.
Please look at Linkedin for experts and connect with them to have personal conversations. or upwork.com to find freelancer
why don't you just use pdf2text instead?
Thanks! This looks really good! I'm definitely going to try this out.

I've found that IRC chat rooms are underrated for these kinds of things. [Kiwichat](https://kiwiirc.com/) is a decent web client if you don't feel like downloading a client, and there are tons of native clients that work pretty well. The #python channel on irc.freenode.net has been an awesome resource for me.
r/learnpython
Data science? That does not cover everything that "science" does.
Thanks for your input! While I don't \_necessarily\_ need a super tight python integration in my instance I would still like to have it. It would make my life easier. One thing I'd want to do is to manipulate a python list consisting of tuples from within rust. And by manipulate I mean append to it.
This isn't a comment, it's a multi line string. As a result, using this will cause the program to run more slowly (though not by much), particularly if you use lots of them. It's always better to use several single line comments rather than this.
Technically, it's a multi-line string literal, but an expression without side-effects might as well be a comment. I don't know if you know about docstrings, but that's where you put a string literal at the top of a module, function or class definition, and that's part of what you see when you do `help(foo)`. Example: &gt;&gt;&gt; def hello(): ... "this function frobnicates the blarg" ... return 42 ... &gt;&gt;&gt; help(hello) Help on function hello in module __main__: hello() this function frobnicates the blarg Traditionally, we use multi-line strings so you can add in-depth documentation of how the function works, its parameters and return values, etc.
That's not PEP8 compliant, but I don't care. You might experience resistance from others that do. PEP8 says use # except for docstrings.
data science can encompass all things applied to data (regardless of field) do you think that there are things done with python in the field of science, that are done without data? 
Your IDE has a shortcut for it. Usually it's select the block and use ctrl+/ but it'll depend on your software. 
Visual Studio. Not VS Code...the actual IDE Visual Studio. It does python too! It's the greatest Python dev environment of all time! Take that internet.
Despite you being a professional Python developer - Excel use is down [0], and python use is up [1]. [0] - https://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/jobs/uk/ms%20excel.do [1] - https://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/jobs/uk/python.do
&gt; One thing I'd want to do is to manipulate a python list consisting of tuples from within rust. And by manipulate I mean append to it. Then the simplest way by far would be to build a module. It might be possible to do it over CFFI but it would likely be much more difficult, you'd need to send Python functions over as opaque function pointers or something, possibly with additional functions providing for the conversion of C types to Python and the like.
You're probably using your system Python instead of the Homebrew one to run your script. Please use `which python` to verify that you're using the right Python.
&gt; but i really wanna port to Vim :) What's stopping you from making the leap? With modern plugins you can get your code written in a breeze. :)
&gt; If classes are to prevent repeat code... They aren't. Functions are to prevent repeat code. Classes are the encapsulate code.
You could use f-strings "Nous sommes le " + datetime.today().strftime('%d-%m-%Y') + " ! " becomes f"Nous sommes le {datetime.today():%d-%m-%Y} ! " You can get the day of the year by just doing day_of_year = datetime.now().timetuple().tm_yday To figure out the number of days in a year you could use the `calendar` module (say `calendar.isleap(year)`). progressbar: n = size * percentage / 100 return f"{'#' * n} + {'-' * (size - n)} | " 
Real Python programmers use ed
Java and objc are falling behind too. Android supports kotlin which is a (subjectivly) better version of java for example. I think iOS uses swift now? And there's a huge push to maintain one set of code for both OS's with things like xamarin and flutter. Python is popular for backend services like a middleware between your database and the app via REST services. You just don't generally do front end stuff with python in my experience. There are better tools for that.
Jupyter Notebooks is great for prototyping and quick tests, since it brings an enormours lot of interactivity to the table. For development which reaches and endpoint, I use VS Code + and its Python extension.
doom emacs
I'm a little late to the party and I hate to repeat what other have commented, but I just wanted to add that over the course of 2018 VS Code has become by far the most used editor in my office full of python programmers. We are platform agnostic, but it's functionality out of the box, easy to install plugins and the ability to share one's settings in a simple json file have made it one of the favorites. Of course, some people still prefer VIM and there are a few Sublime users, but the trend is there to switch to Code.
&gt; From what Im told Software Development would be the best choice for getting into the IT field with no degree. This is exactly the opposite of the truth. If you want to work with computers somehow, you want to be strictly IT without any programming. Installing OSes, unlocking passwords, doing virus scans, etc. Much easier to get in there without a degree. There may be some physical labor involved, though. Hooking up computers, running network cable, etc.
No dude. I'm this business the only thing that matters is good looks. 
I think this is a question which just cannot be answered here fully. But I can say, for learning Python not from the basic level, you need to have some programming idea in Java or C. The concepts are similar, at least the basic ones. If you need to brush up Python, just go through some videos. The basics will need only a day or two if you are already accustomed to coding from before. Now, to delve into DS, you have to tread that carefully. I guess there are millions of pathways which will give you this idea, about how to go into DS with Python. I am currently working on self paced projects on Data Viz with Python. You can take a look at them here in my [Projects](https://bidyutchanda.github.io/recentprojects/) page. For any other questions, you can [Contact Me](https://bidyutchanda.github.io/aboutme/) :) We can have a nice talk. 
Yes.
 def u_simondvt(): """ This is a multiline comment. """ pass
\`which python3\` returns \` /usr/local/bin/python3\` which should be the Homebrew Python.
Looking around my it dept right now, hmmm ummm ... 
Rather then dev why not go into support roles, theres certs you can get things cheaper than going for a full on degree. I bet there may even be a program in your city for those certs 
Lot of new year’s resolutions getting started today!
check out my blog. I share it exactly for people like you. I was in the same boat a few months ago, but tried a dozen or so easy projects and wrote about them. https://stevepython.wordpress.com/ You should be able to get plenty of ideas and inspiration there, or you could maybe build on what I started. Some of my recent projects are: Windows shutdown timer An Insult Machine URL shortener Meme creator Mastermind game Card games IMDB scraper Wordpress blog scraper Reddit Image Grabber BBC news ticker Widget auto coder You get the idea. 
I worked on this and I’d be happy to talk about Wallaroo or stream processing if anyone has any questions.
What are some examples? 
Just released version 0.4 of [reader](https://github.com/lemon24/reader), a feed aggregator library + web UI. This minor release improves feed sorting
Yea, this is true. Keep up with coding on the side but get a few certs now: A+, Net+, and Sec+. You can get an entry job on that.
automatetheboringstuff.com It’s not a PDF it’s a website, or you can buy it, though it’s free to read on the website
Expounding here: In Data Science, you can get by with Pandas, Numpy and Scipy and probably nothing else. This is the one time I'd recommend Anaconda since its focus is the Data Science stack. &amp;#x200B; You can develop skills in the other areas of Python over time but a partial understanding of Python is enough to handle a lot of problems.
I wanna learn pycharm 
I recently picked up an amazing book by [Sean Luke](https://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/) called [Essentials of Metaheuristic](https://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/book/metaheuristics/Essentials.pdf)s The book discusses various optimization methods that involve a "guided- but random approach", usually called stochastic optimization. &amp;#x200B; I've slowly been working my way through and tried to implement some of the concepts in Python from scratch \[[github](https://github.com/frederikgram/PMH)\], and create a framework \[[github](https://github.com/frederikgram/PYGA)\] around the models i implement, for easier use in the future. &amp;#x200B;
&gt; It't not IDE Exactly. It's a programmer's editor with a rich ecosystem of plugins - just what a seasoned programmer needs.
&gt; OP specifically asked for IDE OP is a newbie.
Does it download only the audio stream so that the data used is minimum that the full video download? Or does it download the whole video data and then separates the audio part and plays it?
If you meant 'proficient' rather than 'professional' possibly. Otherwise, Being professional at data science with python implies being professional with python. You'll need to know programming in a general sense (e.g. variables, control structures, errors and exceptions, design patterns,) the python implementation of those, and then whatever modules are needed for data science. &amp;#x200B;
Have you tried MATLAB or R?

Well it looks like Flask is the winner. I will have a look at it. Thank you everyone.
So? These are just statistics of both technologies in isolation. They tell you *nothing* about the effect that Python is having on Excel.
Nice!
If you want plug-ins integration then I'd recommend Pycharm IDE. Otherwise try sublime editor
Pycharm or spyder
You should. I messed around with Sublime for close to more than 300 hours before I moved on to PyCharm, and never looked back except for simple quick scripts. The debugger’s amazing, and so too are the many quality of life features like the documentation, the diff/VCS and others. I tried and liked WingIDE and even bought the pro one but I’ve sort of abandoned it, as the interface feels kinda clunky even though I’d hazard that it’s equally or more powerful than PyCharm. 
Django, a little bit more work to get setup but allows you to go from single page to reddit size websites using the same structure. Highly recommended! 
Me too. Though I haven’t been opening atom as much lately, I really only use it for git diff views and commiting... atom is far ahead in that regard when compared to vscode
Sublime text
When i first started out, and actually for a few years i just used IDLE, i see little point in many of the features IDEs' like PyCharm has for a beginner. Afterwards i started to transition to Sublime Text, mainly because of [plugin system](https://packagecontrol.io/) But as most others, i think PyCharm is unbeatable for larger-scale project, especially how well it handles virtual environments and external tools. One problem is the terrible performance. Where an editor &amp; terminal combo always feel responsive and snappy (for me at least) If you're looking for advice, i would honestly stick with IDLE until you're more comfortable with the language, probably until you start noticing import errors from having multiple version of the same package consistently or get the need for multiple version. &amp;#x200B;
PyCharm Community Edition
Thanks! you have amazing projects! definitely will learn greatly from it and will ask you questions!! &amp;#x200B;
Sure! And, the more you do quick and dirty solutions, the more you'll see where and when abstractions like functions and methods can make your life easier, how things like generators and list comprehensions can streamline your work and reduce errors. That's really been my experience as a (solo) researcher who has become a (team) data scientist. ##just opinion below Your job always is to write code that someone -- even if it's just you a week from now -- can pick up and figure out what it does. To develop "clean enough" workflows so your data transforms are repeatable (and reversible!). It doesn't have to be pretty. But it does have to be organized and coherent. Your future self will thank you for that.
PyCharm
Some people just like to watch the world burn...

You could always throw what you have on github, and post the link here. I'm sure many hands would make small work of this. 
I like to use atom &amp;#x200B;
There is some degree of ageism in this industry, but with the sheer number of jobs available, it's a surmountable obstacle. If you enjoy coding it's a worthwhile goal but if you just want to be a computer-toucher, it'll be easier to do non-coding stuff like basic computer janitoring springing into more advanced stuff like security or networking. 
No. After long hours of reading and researching I came to the conclusion that python could be a great, easy, and powerful language to learn for data science. Moreover, most of the pharmaceutical companies that I might apply to after graduating use python since it's an open source language.
How's it like learning both python and Java at the same time? 
Unfortunately the page requires login, and login requires a monthly fee. I'll check out github though, hadn't considered it before. Thanks!
VSCode and vim. I just use vim so I won't forget how really.
If you started programming after Python 3 was a thing, I figure odds are good you don't even know what 'ed' is.
PyCharm is the best I know, now I'm just learning Visual Studio and the Python support is just bolted on (separate menu options for Python profiling vs general code profiling, etc). What I actually like is the solution vs project separation. But still, PyCharm is much more Python oriented and I recommend it immensely.
Vim is my fallback in all things, but I am currently extremely happy with VS Code (w/ Vim bindings). I was a Sublime Text user for a long time, but switch at the end of last year and have been happy. VS Code feels relatively lightweight, has a great plugin ecosystem, and is pretty smart about all of the languages I work with regularly.
Enable the vim plugin in Pycharm :)
Sure :)
I'd say that is what everyone does with any general programming language. I don't expect there are many people that are very proficient in all the things you can do with Python: data science, machine learning, web apps, GUIs, etc. And then for each there are different libraries... Of course, all of these areas require some level of proficiency in core Python (is there a proper term for that?), i.e. data structures (lists and dictionaties and stuff), control flows (if/then/else, for loops and friends), exception handling and a bunch of other stuff. So yeah, learn core Python and how to use the data science libraries you need to use and you should be good!
You surely meant FORTRAN, not Python?
If I understand what you're attempting so far, all that would likely be required is a 'save as html' of one (possibly a few) of the pages, assuming that doesn't violate the terms of service. Once the script is working with that static file, the last mile shouldn't be too difficult.
I didn't think Zalando would ever do something positive in its existence.
https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python#editor-plugins-and-ides PyCharm is really the best. A properly configured vim is good, too, (and a good idea if you're going to do anything in linux CLI) but can be a pain the ass. If you use more than python then the IDEA community addition with python add-ons is decent as well (though not as powerful as PyCharm)
At the minute, the problem is that the information I need is in an itable and now amount of *view page source* or *view frame source* has yielded the table itself. I've not been able to get at those values outside of using *inspect element*.
Used vim with some plugins for a while but wanted some things like git integration and folding of blocks of code. Tried Pycharm and was quickly charmed. It had the features I was looking for and some more. What really sold me was when I renamed a function and Pycharm offers to rename every occurrence of the function in my code. 
Can you be fluent in a spoken language without knowing how to ace an A&amp;P exam in that new language? I'd say so.

I'm going to go against the grain here and say "No". &amp;#x200B; Python is a tool, and it or another similar tool will be important to your work on a regular basis. This means that you need, at bare minimum, a basic competency in Python itself and a strong understanding of the libraries that you are working with. Anything less, and you will be working with greatly reduced efficiency and effectiveness. This doesn't mean that I'm telling you to go study things like Flask or Django, just that a solid understanding of the language is essential, or you will lack the understanding required to write code that is clear, understandable, and reasonably efficient. &amp;#x200B; You can do a good deal of work without really understanding the core language, but it will be "cargo cult" programming, and you won't have the tools to debug something when it breaks. Take the time to work through a good general programming course and a bit of the "algorithms and datastructures" background work. Once you've done that, start with a handful of libraries that are central to your discipline and learn them well. This will take a few months to a year depending on how much time you have available. When you're done, you will have a solid understanding of Python and your core tools, and you can learn whatever you need to get a particular job done. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
I'm well aware. I was maintaining a Python 2.4 program until this year when we upgraded to Python 2.7. As I said " if you must support both"
You could also replace the `progress_bar` function with `tqdm`
Hey there, just FYI - if you use a bit.ly link anywhere on reddit, it goes right into spam. I've rescued this one, but I recommend not using them anymore.
Just for scripting Vscode and for large projects pyCharm 
change things like `if rich is True:` to: `if rich:` and why are things like this `# Create new empty list` `inputlist = []` or `# If times is 1` `if times == 1:` commented?
I second PyCharm, though I use Atom too when I need to play with HTML and stuff
If he's using the right youtube-dl command, it can just pull the audio
What about inheritance?
They don't even look slightly used! I wonder whether they changed your life or account statement.
Thank you appreciate it :)
There’s a bot in twitter that does this, @year_progress
I’m sorry, I didn’t know it was a crime to properly take care of books.
VS Code

IDLE for the time being
Yeah I am sorry, I didn't knew you were taking care of them by not opening and reading them ... my bad 🤷‍♂️
I end us using vscode more because I tend to dev in several environments but pycharm is definitely the most complete solution
Maybe you should start reading, sounds like you never touched a book in years
Read through all you guys' comments. Only a year 2 student in Poly(Singapore's equivalent of High School) so didn't really understand the more complicated comments but still a good read. Leaving this post more enlighened.
Actually nothing, i use vim but not all the time. I guess i'm not ready to use it as my default editor yet (:
PyCharm. I liked Atom for Javascript but I usually ran in to headaches trying to use it for Python. No headaches from PyCharm so far. (Except that it seems to tell me theres a new update every 2 days)
Sublime Text and the command line. If you're new to programming and/or Python, I'd suggest that you keep it simple.
Sounds like it's rendered using JavaScript. You would probably have to a headless browser like selenium.
Sure you can use flask with it. Naive question but if they are visually impaired how can they read the braille? I'm struggling to visualise what app you want to build
Pydev. However I don’t trust Eclipse any further than I can kick it. Eclipse seems to be designed to end up broken after an update. Plus some warnings seemingly confuse the user with respect to what will actually happen yay or nay. Pydev though works in a way that is very pleasing to me. It is fast enough on modern hardware and you do get all of Eclipses goodies. 
It's 2018. Deploying software is a solved problem. This is the kind of argument that Delphi users use to try to claim that their expensive, proprietary Pascal is a better development choice than C# or Java. No one cares that something is an a single executable or not. If they did, C#, Java, Python, etc. wouldn't be some of the most-used languages in the world.
Agrees. 
That's what I've been using. Tried focusing on that window and searching any way I can. That's where I got stuck. Elements always missing from the rest of the html.
&gt;There is still a considerable amount of Python 2.7 users There are still a considerable number of Windows 7 users, but you don't develop for the past, you develop for the future. &gt; Some libraries of my clients are probably still rocking Python &gt;2.7 Almost every library of significance runs under Python 3 today, and many major libraries already pledged to stop releasing Python 2 versions a year early. http://py3readiness.org/ 359 out of the top 360 python libraries run under Python 3 - I'd say that's pretty good! &gt;Python 2.7 is still the default one with many OSes Windows doesn't ship with Python, OS X ships with an ancient python solely to run some ancient tool on their OS, and most Linux distros include both 2.7 and 3.x. The only difference is starting python with "python" or "python3". 
Can we get TLDR; please.
Pycharm and emacs.
I've tried them all - PyCharm was the clear winner.
I use PyCharm, but strip it all down so it does nothing more than syntax highlighting, member code completion, and jumping to definitions/declarations of classes, functions, and variables.
Guido is gone. They have a committee and they know how that works in terms of electing and sacking. They have no idea yet what direction the committee will take Python or how they will decide it.
geany 
Yeah I know but I wanted to code it by myself ^^
I know but I wanted to code it myself and to do in in my home language : French, and to play with the Twitter API ^^
Video playback issue?
Same here
I didn't know that I could do that ^^ I didn't know that either ^^ it would make my code a bit less understandable tho but I definitely not these, thanks ^^
Atom = free sublime
why both?
Thanks mom
May be it's a YouTube issue. Everything is working fine on my end.
I would take a look at the Network-inspector of your browser to see the redirects/what it does. E.g. in chrome Ctrl-Shift-I, Network. Check the "Preserve log" checkbox to keep history over redirects and page changes. Assuming you're already logged into Keycloak, you might not even get a login form but it should authenticate the request and immediately redirect back to your app. &amp;#x200B; E.g. I navigate to an application and click the OIDC authentication button: \- The application causes the client to go to `https://keycloak.mydomain.fi/auth/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/auth?params` \- Keycloak automatically authenticates me and returns a 302 redirect based on the redirect\_uri parameter in the request like this: `https://myapp.mydomain.fi/login/generic_oauth?params`
Does youtube itself provide the facility to stream either video or just audio ? If not, then youtube-dl can't do much. I always wondered why doesn't youtube provide a audio only experience if one wants to.
Yes, I wasn't trying to diminish what you did, Twitter API is a great starting point to play.
vi and nano
How much does it cost?
Also add a requirements.txt file and a screenshot in the repo.
I feel like a loser.... I still use Vanilla IDLE
Okay! Feel free to contact me and I can suggest a couple plugins that may come in handy.
My entire lab uses Spyder, and it’s always been up to the task for us to quickly write and test scripts to visualize and transform our data in various new ways.
for a second I thought UI was curse and usable in terminal maybe a new feature ? d:
it does, behind subscription. 
"I always wondered why doesn't youtube provide a audio only experience if one wants to." So that they can monetize YouTube premium. 
Community edition is free, full version is expensive (similar to full PyCharm). Biggest cost is the loss of dignity and respect among Python community.
Thank you for the plug. Let me know if you have any questions!
Love your username
I love you both
That's very interesting yeah ^^ 
That's fair. I did the same thing a while ago.
you can get automate the boring stuff at https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc for free
it really absolutely is a fantastic dev environment. it's definitely worth it to use a real big boy IDE instead of the weird hipster editors. 
I admin I don't know Braillie, and hardly understood your code, but here some guild lines to reuse script for webapp: 1. Refactor logic from usage. Meaning split the "conversation " part from the input/output part. Ideally you would have the following code from english2braillie import translate print(translate(input())) 2. Be fault tolerance, webapp should not crash. I know it is true to any software, but webapp expected to return valid response , not 400/500 page. BTW, the `eval` you use is problematic in that sense. 3. Do input validation. Any input processing may lead to vulnerability. You won't want someone to use your webapp to distribute malicious scripts.
