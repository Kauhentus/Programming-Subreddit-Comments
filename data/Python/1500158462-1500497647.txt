I made the whole thing at school, and the version of python on their computers only had tkinter and didn't have pygame. And yes it was awful, do not use tkinter.
The whole thing runs on canvas :)
Thanks man, it took maybe four months to get 90% done, then about 8 to get the last 10% since I never really wanted to do it anymore, finally glad it's finished 
Thanks man, glad you enjoy the game 
I've been programming for 3 years, and have also done Computer Science GCSE (OCR) and Computer Science A Level (OCR). I think JavaScript it better since you can share games with only a link instead of having to compile and distribute, and it can all run on browsers. This is only suitable for lightweight games though :)
Double click the .exe ? I think, I havent done this before 
Perhaps, I wouldn't want to be diddled though, I haven't really done any of this before, but I'm sure everyone is nice and friendly here 
Sorry, it uses the winsound module aswell, which kinda makes it only windows compatible sorry 
Thanks for the contribution :)
Same. Free like I'm being trolled here
Yes, it was quick to find the link. What does that have to do with whether it was legal or not? The site seems to have no rights to distribute the book.
Because that seems like more obvious spam is the thinking. Plus I think the way they look at it for seo the more articles and valid sources link to it the higher a ranking it gets in googles results. So basically if anyone clicks and signs up here well great for business for them but they also get the benefit of seeming like a more legitimate resource for search engines as now the graph has multiple nodes and edges. I wouldn't doubt if this reddit article gets linked to some blog too.
Bokeh can output `div` and `script` elements, see the [components documentation](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/embed.html#components). You can embed these in a html page directly.
Cool game, and to think using tkinter very impressive. Looking at the trailer I bet it impossible to play/finish the game which makes it quiet cool for me
If you check my account, I've just made a post in r/python about publishing this game, you can download it right now and have a go for yourself :) 
...And get rid of the line where reverse is called.
Cool thanks!
Typo: TEXT = messagess.encode("utf-8").splitlines() ^ here?
That's an entirely different environment. Do you want to set system-wide environmental variables? How you do that will depend on your OS. In Windows, press start and type "environmental variables" and you can set them in there. 
The settings say 'Python console for this project' so one would think the environment variables would be available for scripts run in that project's console. I do not want the variables to be system wide. They are specific to a certain project. I'm on a Mac and know I can set environment variables in my bash_profile but would rather not do that.
Ah, perfect, thanks! I will have to try that. I remember skimming over that thinking it was for something else. Meanwhile I just started using matplotlib and found Sentdex's intro vid helpful (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7Bo_J8x_dw) 
Yeah but what pycharm means is "the console the pycharm will boot in order to run this". If you start the terminal without pycharm the variables won't be set. You could use a small bash script to set the variables and then launch your python, which is basically what pycharm does. But at that point you may as well code the variables directly into your python or make a configuration file that your program reads. 
Oh so I just tested that and I can see the environment variables in the python *console*. But they are not available when running something from pycharm's built-in *terminal*. That is the standard behavior?
&gt; python console What's that? You mean IDLE? And what environmental variables are you trying to use? 
That's the thing, when i click it it only opens an empty CMD window.
I'm super interested and would love to see what you're working on! I've been thinking of working on something similar recently but can't get past whether to make it a web app or something that works offline.
Ok I finally figured this out. I had to go to Run &gt; Edit Configurations. Then select Defaults &gt; Python and set the environment variables there. Any scripts run within that project will have the environment variables available. What is confusing is it seems like you are editing the environment variables for ALL projects, but from what I see it only applies to your project. I hope Pycharm imrpoves the UI on this feature. It's very core to every project I do but does not really make sense from looking at where they placed it in the menus.
Oh crap... noticed these variables are only available if I use the Run tool for a file. What if I need to pass in command line arguments? Getting a bit frustrated!
You still have to install some lib via `apt` if you're on a debian variant. Idk about windows or macOS.
If I'm looking to educate myself In Python and data science in general, learning SQL would still be a good idea, right? I assumed SQL knowledge was required for a lot of development jobs. 
You can use [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) to make a bot for Discord.
I made a bot for a site called hack.chat (not for hacking, it's just called that referring to programming). Here's what my bot looks like (WIP) https://github.com/neelkamath/hack.chat-bot and i made a library to connect to the site so you don't need to work with websockets until you understand them https://github.com/neelkamath/hclib. My first bot was for twitter so that's also a great start but they are currently changing their API so you're code might break. My bot was my first project and it taught me a lot of stuff, just remember to externalize the configuration files (like the bots name etc.) otherwise it'll be difficult to make changes in the way it works later
Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner is a great book which you can find online for free. Helped me a lot.
what's the name of the book? and what code editor did u use for Python?
"Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner" I used idle we comes with the original python package 
Pandas might work for reading out of the spreadsheet.
Very impressive ! Can't figure out how you made it using only tkinter hahaha. Keep up the good work!
Can I get that dumbed down? I agree that #3 seems a bit little unnecessary, wouldn't it just be str2 = str1
Surprised no mention yet of [API Star](https://github.com/tomchristie/apistar)
More narrowly define your scope(i.e., what exact things do you want the personal assistant to do?), and then work on finding out what scripting those things entails. For example, do you want it to remind you about appointments? Look into what it would take to script a notification based on your calendar. etc.
I found sololearn.com to be excellent
Weather, Calender, the capability to send a message are all things I want to initially have it be able to do. Eventually I'd like it to speak, and have voice recognition. 
str2 = str1 doesn't create a copy of str1, it makes str2 point to the same memory location as str1, so you would have two variables point to the same thing. Since strings are immutable, this doesn't have too many implications. However consider this problem with lists. lst1 = [1, 2, 3] lst2 = lst1 print(lst2) &gt;&gt;&gt; [1, 2, 3] lst1.append(4) print(lst2) &gt;&gt;&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4] Even though I'm only changing lst1, since lst2 isn't a copy of lst1 but a variable that points to the same memory, lst2 gets altered as well 
Can you help me understand why you wrote: if not device.startswith('sd'): continue Instead of: if device.startswidth('sd'): ?
Yea I believe they were trying to teach us how to create a copy of something so you always have an original copy of it. Is there a way to do that if it's not str2 = str1[:] ?
You could make a new string and then slice the old one in, but you don't need to, strings are immutable. If you have x=y="foo" and slice y then x remains unchanged.
There's almost never a good reason to create an identical copy of a string, but this works str1 = "hello world" str2 = "".join(list(str1)) 
I tried downloading it, but I cannot play the game. I see the window come up, but when I click "Start Game", the program crashes. C:\Users\&lt;me&gt;\Downloads\Vector Venture\Vector Venture&gt;"Vector Venture.exe" Traceback (most recent call last): File "Code 3.8 Menu System.py", line 2288, in &lt;module&gt; File "Code 3.8 Menu System.py", line 1609, in newLevel File "Code 3.8 Menu System.py", line 1811, in readLevel IndexError: list index out of range Failed to execute script Code 3.8 Menu System 
I can't think of a reason to need to guarantee non-identity of a "copied" string, But if you needed to do it, I think you'd have to actually mutate the string to protect against possible future optimizations. For example I'm getting "x = 'abc'; x is x%()" as False in 2.7 and True in 3.5. It appears that even copy.copy(x) does not even copy a string! It's actually a pretty tough question!
You might try here: https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/default/optimized.html Install the openpyxl module and adjust the example given above on looping through rows. Then apply the code from pynet in the loop.
Probably just to avoid having to indent eveything
That's not really a python question ... that comes down to the module that you are using to draw. Those modules (tkinter, graphics, matplotlib, pyqt, etc) are generally not written in python and are available from many programming languages. Try matplotlib. I contributed to a recreation of /r/place once that worked pretty smoothly (placing 10,000 pixels every 50 ms on a 1 million pixel canvas). https://github.com/novel-yet-trivial/re-place 
Is it necessary to use Outlook? You could do something with Google sheets and a Gmail account. While it doesn't use Python, this seems like it might work. https://developers.google.com/apps-script/articles/sending_emails
Ok thanks. 
I work support for an eCommerce platform which is quite limited with regard to what you can do with the interface out of the box, so I've been building a suite of bulk tools using our API that give users a 'super tool' UI to make bulk adjustments without having to hire a developer, or make changes one by one. It's been a good excuse to finally dig deeper into Python!
Anyone has a theory about that drop in April?
Nah, people are just really into snakes and less into coffee nowadays. 
You can specify arguments in the Run configurations where you set the environment variables. Not very handy if they regularly change, but it is possible. Really it sounds like you have an XY problem. Why do you need environment variables set only for this specific script/project and not system wide?
requests is the right library, yes. However, how you page through the results will depend entirely on how the API was implemented. I've worked with API's that return total number of records, number of pages, or simply a cursor to the next page (with no indication of how many pages are still to come). Is it a public API? If you shared the link to it it would be a lot easier to give you specific ideas. 
Was this for your OCR A2 project? If so, you put it l loads of work and you deserve that 20%
Uhm, the category is not accurate, there is Computer &amp; Electronics / Programming, and [that][] doesn't look like it's coming. [that]: https://trends.google.com/trends/explore/TIMESERIES?cat=31&amp;geo=US&amp;q=Python,Java&amp;hl=en-US&amp;sni=1
You could try an Arduino- it's lower level than the embedded linux of Raspberry Pi, but a pyBoard running micropython would definitely suit your needs. It'd be more expensive than a Pi, I think, but could be an interesting project to get you into writing code for an embedded system. I'm a software engineer who writes C mostly but I do use Python often for some auto-code generation or parsing of terminal outputs. Alternative: use a much cheaper Arduino Uno; Arduino programming is C/C++ based but the library support for peripherals (including FTDI emulator for USB comms, UART being the serial protocol I'd wanna look at) literally just be functon calls like UART_GetBytesFromCOMPort(short uint comPortNumber) (not sure if that's the actual function but it's not much more complicated than that. You'd have to initiate the UART peripheral first, but that's also another call like UART_Init(long uint baudrate, short uint comPortInstanceNumber). It would be a fun embedded systems intro and would not be too hard even if you have 0 embedded dev experience. Just offering another suggestion, though running full Python on a Pi would probably be the easiest solution. I think the pyBoard costs more than the Raspberry Pi, and that's not even going to run full Python - it's micropython. It will have similar functions as an Arduino Uno board. Hope some of this is helpful and best of luck on your project :)
Could you provide a link?
I glad to you :D Thank you!
You should be able to just write your app as normal, then run it with the EGLFS platform plugin (assuming your copy of Qt is compiled with it enabled).
Found this after a quick search: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/316866/ping-a-site-in-python
You can use the win32com package from pywin32, and use it to write a python version of this: http://www.ozgrid.com/forum/showthread.php?t=15933 
Hi, I'm from the PyCharm team. Yes, each Run Configuration has settings for that specific run configuration. This lets you have one Run Configuration for, say, "dev" and one for "prod", etc. The run configuration can also pass in arguments to your script, both before the script and after the script.
Even less so if you [don't restrict it to the US](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=Python,Java&amp;geo=US&amp;cat=31#TIMESERIES). 
Very cool idea 
I've installed PySide through apt-get, so haven't explicitly downloaded a copy of Qt. I've not come across the EGLFS platform plugin before, what role does it play?
What API are you using and what methods you are wanting to execute? Also for saving the data to a CSV file have a read through the documentation of the CSV lib in Python - https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html 
You want Qt 5 for this, not Qt 4. It introduces the concept of platform plugins - basically bits of Qt that tell the framework how to draw graphics, handle input, etc. EGLFS stands for "EGL fullscreen", I think, and it's a plugin that renders directly to a framebuffer using OpenGL.
To clarify situation i retested few things. What i tried is executing coroutine in different loop on different thread: ``` loop = asyncio.new_event_loop() future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(self.send(payload), loop) thread = threading.Thread(target=loop.run_until_complete, args=(future,)) thread.start() thread.join() ``` `self.send()` is coroutine here. It does not work: `RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'WebSocketConnection.send' was never awaited`. I also tried manually creating a thread, passing a websocket to it, then creating new loop and executing `send()` coroutine in there. As i said in another post it did not work as well because websocket was created on loop on main thread and can not execute in different loop. Both of these approaches entirely block main thread as we have to wait on second thread until it returns the result. My approach on the other hand does not block main thread at all. I updated example on the post to better reflect it. Here it is: async def other_asynchronous_code(): for i in range(5): print(i) await asyncio.sleep(1) async def asynchronous_code(): await asyncio.sleep(2) return 42 def synchronous_code(): return run_nested_until_complete(asynchronous_code()) async def coroutine(): print(synchronous_code()) monkeypatch() loop = asyncio.get_event_loop() loop.run_until_complete(asyncio.gather(other_asynchronous_code(), coroutine())) loop.close() Which prints: 0 1 2 42 3 4 As you can see other coroutine is scheduled while synchronous code is waiting for coroutine `asynchronous_code()` that it called to complete. Everything is still totally async and thread-safe.
That's the dilemma I'm facing at the moment. I've got ~6 months worth of development into a PySide (Qt4) application, which is having performance issues on an X Server-based OS, so I'm looking at whatever means necessary to prevent having to rewrite in either PyQt5 or C++.
Are you sure porting to PyQt5 is that difficult? The differences between the two are fairly minimal, really, especially if you're not digging deep into the framework's internals, and the performance boost should be very noticeable.
I'm sorry, it only works on windows? If your on windows then I don't know what the problem is sorry
Thanks
Wow. Solid work friend.
Wow. Solid work friend.
Thanks man. 
It looks like the .txt file called 'currentLevel' has an incorrect value in, try changing it to '1', or perhaps some of the .CSV files have been changed, try really downloading it, but I haven't seen this problem before sorry 
Thanks man. 
That's a very good point. PySide doesn't officially support Qt5 at this point, and I'm unsure when it will. I may have to swap to PyQt and update for Qt5 support. I went with PySide originally for the LGPL license, but haven't kept across the PyQt options of late.
PyQt and PySide both basically copy the C++ API anyway. The porting shouldn't be that difficult. Also, there's a WIP version of PySide for Qt 5.
So... what was the reason for this? I have never seen before anyone use more than one loop.
It looks like `run_nested_until_complete` will have 100% cpu.
Awesome, thanks mate :) Have you played with the EGLFS plugin with PyQt? I've not found any sample code/instructions as of yet.
It's not something you need to configure at all. You just build Qt with it enabled and then run your application with `QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN=eglfs`.
Your example does not show full picture, sync function should have blocking call. Try to test something like: def synchronous_code(): time.sleep(10) return run_nested_until_complete(asynchronous_code()) async def coroutine(loop): await loop.run_in_executor(synchronous_code()) 
I've never built Qt before, but enabling EGLFS appears quite simple. By 'running my application', is QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN=eglfs a parameter in the python Application.py execute command, or is it within the actual .py module itself?
It's an environment variable you need to set.
There is no much sense to have 2 loops in one process. I saw sync cassandra driver spins connection threads and each thread has event loop to talk with server, not sure why they did not use one loop for multiple connections.
Great, thank you so much! I'll give this a go over the coming couple of days and report back. Much appreciated!
When the exchange web interface is available you can use exchangelib to interface with it. I use exchangelib to connect, search for emails with certain subjects, process them, move the processed mails to another directory and send an email after that. Works great
Ok, but the error message says 3.4. You might just need to be explicit about which python version you run. Normally, if you run it with "python2.7 myprog.py" it should force it to use the correct version. You can also do this in the hashbang line at the top of the script.
But what I liked was the difference in states. Esp. Python in Massachusetts vs. Java in Washington. 
Pyautogui. Can't link from phone. This library can automate KB and mouse, and read the screen. However b/c it is an online game, reading network traffic for position updates, and injecting your own, would be more efficient than parsing the screen. You would need to do some reverse engineering though. I haven't looked at the game and I'm assuming it's compiled code and not just JS in an embedded browser.
There is no way to guarantee to create a copy of a string which is equal to the original string but not identical to the string. For example, in CPython 2.7, any two one-character strings which are equal will also be identical. If you want to copy a string in python, the correct thing in most circumstances is to do "str2 = str1". (However we wouldn't usually think of this as "copying" the string, so much as having another reference to the same string, but strings are immutable so the concepts are the same.) (edit: specified version)
In CPython 2.7 that will not work on the empty string or on one-character strings, because when two such strings are equal they will also always be identical.
For the web app I'm using the flask so it works:)
Why would it? ~ % time python3 async.py 0 1 2 42 3 4 python3 async.py 0.08s user 0.00s system 1% cpu 5.084 total 
Obviously `time.sleep()` would block main thread, however my module solves entirely different problem. Maybe i fail to properly express the intent, i will try again: module allows executing asynchronous code asynchronously while allowing synchronous code to get result without awaiting on coroutine. Call to `synchronous_code()` in my example blocks for 2 seconds because it is how long `asynchronous_code()` takes to return. However during that time while `synchronous_code()` is waiting other coroutines are still scheduled.
I wrote the reason on the post. To sum it up - i needed to do some aiohttp networking from a library callback that was not async. Can not call async code from sync functions. This patch lifts the limitation.
Should be https://reddit.com/r/python
Nope. The above mentioned snippets are examples of string manipulation - not a reference to the python subreddit URL. However OP was mistaken wrt the string referencing the python subreddit.
Nice Introduction
Because learning SQL by itself is wonderful, and no matter what a project of sufficient complexity will eventually step outside the confines of the ORM or torture itself trying to fit inside the square. I have yet to come across any reasonably large project that has been truly "SQL agnostic". I can't even imagine the rigmarole you'd have to go through to do CI and testing for one. "Let's just spin this up against SQLite*, MySQL, MariaDB, Postgres, MSSQL, OracleDB, DB2 and test that everything works equally. * SQLite happens to be my absolute favourite of this lot for small personal projects. Single file that copies across architectures and platforms with no configuration, yes please!
You may want to read about SNMP. It's not the same as pinging a host but it is commonly used when managing an internal network. It can provide lots of other information that might help and there are tools that can collect and log the data.

If you don't need `type(copy_of_string) is str` to be true, subclassing `str` seems to work: class StringCopy(str): pass assert StringCopy('') is not '' assert StringCopy('') is not StringCopy('') assert StringCopy('') == '' assert StringCopy('') == StringCopy('') 
In the future, /r/learnpython may be more suitable for questions like that. Also, this is a more Pythonic way to check for palindromes: cadena = input("Insert word: ") if cadena == cadena[::-1]: print("It is a palindrome") else: print("It is not a palindrome") That's right, you don't need to make a list out of the string, you can slice strings as well.
I just finished my first ever python app after two weeks of learning Python! It is an app that pastes your clipboard into a dictionary. Every time you copy something new, a new item gets created in that dictionary. So for example, if you copy the word "hello", {1:"hello"} gets added to the dictionary. Then when you copy the word "world", your dictionary becomes {1:"hello", 2:"world"}. And then when you want to get back one of the earlier things you copied, you just enter its "number" into python and python replaces whatever is on your clipboard with that thing. Very very proud of it to be honest.

Out of curiosity, where is this class?
The text file had a "100" in it. I changed it to "1", and things started working again. I had clicked on the "Level Editor", and just exited the program (as I could see no way to go back). That seems to be what gets the program in this state. The game seems very quick. The quotes are shown for an instant, and then they go away. I suspect that you are dealing with timing by doing for loops or some kind of computation? The problem with doing that is that you have to tune the delay logic for each user's computer. If I have a fast computer, everything moves so quickly that it is difficult to play. If you are using Python 3, you should look into time.monotonic() from the standard library. This function will return time in seconds, so you can have your program implement consistent delays regardless of the user's computer performance.
The quoted are meant to be shown quickly, although it would be nice to read them, I didn't want synthetic load screens, and I didn't get a chance to play the game on many other systems, but I thought it would be about right, sorry that it's not. And for having to close the program, the whole menu system was an afterthought as this was only meant to be a small A Level project that ballooned, I tried for a long time to get a menu system working, which I did, but it caused more problems, which caused more problems. If I were to redo this project I would get a better layout, but I didn't think it would get this big. Hope you still enjoyed it, thanks for the feedback
Ok, I'll try passing in arguments via the run configuration. Thanks.
Nice one dude :-) very interesting stuff by the way. 
The database URL is set with an environment variable and is specific to this project. I'm also interacting with a specific AWS account for S3, so am able to set the API keys temporarily for that account, to ensure they don't bleed into other projects. I primarily do web dev, so honestly every project I work on has at least one unique environment variable that does not apply system wide.
If you want there's an algorithm, called the [Miller-Rabin primality test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller–Rabin_primality_test), wich can be used to check if a number is **probably** a prime, but in a very fast way. For example, with this python code, def isStrongPseudoprime(n, a): d, s = n-1, 0 while d % 2 == 0: d, s = d//2, s+1 int(d) t = pow(a, d, n) if t == 1: return True while s &gt; 0: if t == n - 1: return True t, s = pow(t, 2, n), s - 1 return False def isPrime(n, k): if n % 2 == 0: return n == 2 for i in range(1, k): a = randrange(2, n) if not isStrongPseudoprime(n, a): return False return True you can use ```isPrime(n, k)``` to check if n is prime with a probability to get a false positive of 1/4^k. I used this code to generate something like 100 300 digits long primes with k=1000 in less than half an hour
**Miller–Rabin primality test** The Miller–Rabin primality test or Rabin–Miller primality test is a primality test: an algorithm which determines whether a given number is prime, similar to the Fermat primality test and the Solovay–Strassen primality test. Its original version, due to Gary L. Miller, is deterministic, but the correctness relies on the unproven Extended Riemann hypothesis; Michael O. Rabin modified it to obtain an unconditional probabilistic algorithm. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24
Hello! Where do you get to learn any nuances like this one? Does it just come with experience or is it documented somewhere?
This is very impressive. Please share the code!
I'd like to, I'm not sure if anything bad would happen if I did though, maybe my code would be made fun of :( I'll share it in a bit probably 
So, it's more like *str2 = &amp;str1, right?
Nice. I actually own a set, might give this a go and try something new.
You are not the first &gt;:)

Yeyy
Stylistic choice. I just prefer not to add indentation when it's easily possible. Besides, you may want to have more "early continues" in a loop, and then it just looks better: for foo in bar: if p(foo): continue if q(foo): continue … do stuff with foo
I was asking why you tested that the file name *didn't* match, then put in extra code to deal with it, instead of just testing if the file name *did* match. In other words: for names in list: if name == "Bob": print("Hi, Bob!") Seems functionally equivalent, more straightforward, and less work than: for names in list: if name != "Bob": continue print("Hi, Bob!") I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm trying to understand the advantage to doing it your way. 
This is the way I aspie.
No worries, just want to learn. 
Read it twice, Quite detailed. Thanks.
You don't need this to trigger async work on callback. Set asyncio.Event or put_nowait with asyncio.Queue, while your task is waiting event/queue to run. def callback(info): queue.put_nowait(info) async def worker(): while True: info = await queue.get() # do async
Yep, my bad.
I may have forgotten to mention that your code works just great and I appreciate the help.

Great simplification. Most people (me included) see the block chain as some magical, out of reach process. And while I'm sure it's much more complicated than this in production, this does explain some basic concepts.
Here: from collections import defaultdict x = defaultdict(list) values = [(10, 1), (10, 2)] for key, value in values: x[key].append(value) print(values)
Python is very big in machine learning isn’t it?
Dude, you just made my day ;D Thank you! In a side note, can you explain what defaultdict does?
Maybe he has, but I don't think there's anything about boredom in there
Yep!
Good idea; needs more data
It's like a dict but if you try to read from a key that doesn't exist it calls the thing you passed in and inserts the result so in this case I pass list so it basically does your_dict[your_key] = list()
I'm not sure if I'm just using that API incorrectly, but if I try shift it to the second page, it just shows the same page again (https://api.wordpress.org/plugins/info/1.1/?action=query_plugins&amp;page=2). But to answer the first 3 bits of your question: import requests r = requests.get('https://api.wordpress.org/plugins/info/1.1/?action=query_plugins&amp;request%5Bbrowse%5D=popular') data = r.json() num_pages = data['info']['pages'] total_plugins = data['info']['results'] print(num_pages) print(total_plugins) 1758 42188 
Python is used a lot for it because there are many libraries available and their APIs are nicely documented. There are other ones that are used but I'm not familiar with them. Edit: grammar.
hey guys...i m not able to test it for week or so...can someone give me idea how much data is currently available? if its worth remembering at all or if you have some better sources, help young neural network apprentice ^_^

defaultdict is definitely the right answer, but I think it's still important to understand why, so here's an equivalent implementation that doesn't use it: x = dict() values = [(10, 1), (10, 2)] for key, value in values: if x.get(key) is None: x[key] = list() x[key].append(value) 
Also try http://data.world
just package it with youtube-dl
nice, you got it first 👌🏽 i was going to write something really similar. defaultdict changed the game for me a few yrs ago
And how do i get result of coroutine in `def callback()`?
[Yep](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?cat=31&amp;date=2016-01-01%202017-07-16&amp;geo=CN&amp;q=Python,Java,C%2B%2B#TIMESERIES)
Not equivalent in the general case. You should do "if key not in x". 
I can't imagine that. The result is clearly amazing.
Consider your "point of presence" when you are designing your code. Are you pinging from your local work station, a server that is in the same LAN to your target system(s) or across a WAN. Ping (which is a program that using ICMP echo request/reply) can really only indicate that the target is responding, and the round trip time. Ping has no "jitter" metric, which is a measurement of the sequence of packet tx/rx I believe. Remember that ICMP packets have low priority and are sometimes filtered on network segments depending on how the network in configured. Also, I would not recommend a continuous Ping, rather a ping request on some interval, so that you can manage the results. Or a Python [module for Ping.](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&amp;term=ping&amp;submit=search)
That is substantially better, yes.
He's saying the source string should be https, not that the user's answer is wrong. It's a comment about unencrypted http needing to end.

Trying to turn a course assignment last semester into a full-working library. [PySwarms](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/pyswarms) . A simple library for performing Particle Swarm Optimization. It's not done yet and I hope I can finish this throughout summer. I submitted my assignment back then in MATLAB, but I revisited my code last month and ported it to Python. Then I realized, "hey, why not make a module out of this?" Then one thing led to another and I am now working on this lib. 
Using `pop` removes the last item from the list. In the case of pastrami, you *also* call `remove()`, which removes another instance from the list.

It's so annoying... unless you build the consensus algorithm it has nothing to do with blockchain. Without it, there is no educational value.

That nuance is an implementation detail of CPython that to my knowledge is only "documented" in mailing lists, the bug tracker, and/or the source code itself. The behavior of when two strings will end up being the same object is the subject of optimization, and generally not the concern of the python programmer, except perhaps in very special cases where the speed at which strings are compared is exceptionally important. The one related detail that is documented is the `intern` function in the `sys` module. Every time python generates a string object, it can decide if it should be held in a special internal dictionary which ensures that there is only one instance of that particular string. Generally the python runtime will decide for you if it makes more sense to put the string in the special dict, or just allow there to be potentially multiple instances of that same string in memory. Wikipedia has [an article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning) on string interning in general. The benefit of interning a string is that comparing two interned strings is fast as you just have to see if they point at the same place in memory, not inspect their contents. Another benefit is you don't end up making multiple copies of the string. However, there is a cost to interning it in the first place, and that cost is not repaid if the string is not compared to other interned strings or the same string is never encountered again. [This article](http://guilload.com/python-string-interning/) has a great discussion on string interning in python 2.7.7. Things have changed in python 3.6.2, but the basic ideas are pretty much the same. The one thing you can do if you are making some strings that you definitely want to intern the strings but python is not doing it automatically is the following: import sys my_string = sys.intern(my_function_that_returns_a_string()) Now `my_string` is guaranteed to be interned. You've paid the cost of adding it to the dictionary, but if you need to compare it to potentially identical strings it may be faster. TLDR - not much documented. Comes only with both _experience_ and _curiosity_. I only know this now because I got curious and read about it all morning.
Any way we can flair or maybe flag all these medium posts that are nothing but a cheap attempt to get people to buy some udemy course?
the list is an object, so cadena is an instance. You are telling python that in_cadena is that same instance of cadena. try ~~in_cadena = cadena~~ in_cadena = list(cadena)
Is this really more pythonic? I think the changes to `Block` are `__hash__` and `__getitem__`, right? While [`__hash__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__) is useful for defining an object's hash as used by Python built-ins like sets and dicts, I think it's debatable whether it should be used in this case, as it's being used for a very specific purpose that may not require a hash with the same properties as those built-ins. As for [`__getitem__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__), it is my understanding that this is normally used to implement dynamic key-lookup like in lists and dicts (e.g. `block['index']`). I'm not sure why you would use it in the way that you do. In fact you don't use the syntax implemented by this method in the code: you use namespace lookup instead (`block.index`). I also notice that you added parentheses after `class Block`, which is unnecessary. Additionally you've changed the formatting of the hash function, making it [exceed 79 characters](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length) and in my opinion less readable. Please let me know if I'm mistaken on any of these points. ---- One change that I would suggest in order to make the original code more pythonic would be to use the unary version of `range`: for i in range(num_of_blocks_to_add): And arguably it would be better to have `Block` subclass `object`.
I agree with you but it is a good start. I wouldn't mind a part 2 with a consensus algorithm. 
Aren't plotly plots hosted on plotly's website?
Also, do you by any chance know how to embed these scripts inside a wordpress post or page? I'm a javascript noob and this is taking hours longer than I thought it would. the only thing I can think of is that the script has something else than jquery as a dep(endency). I've tested window alert scripts and got them to work, but the second I try to get a button or graph to load there's nothing but whitespace.
Oh, I got it. You should use janus lib (it's sync/async queue)

There is an offline mode that generates either an html file or a div and script tag that you can host yourself. That second link has examples. 
MQTT is a beautiful protocol. After spending some time with it, it will now be my goto for these projects. Super robust and reliable, and it's the perfect choice for controlling hardware. If anyone is looking at this later on here are some tips: * Use mosquitto as a broker. * Paho if you're using python to build the server/client. * Use Mosquitto's auth plugin, set it up with mysql to control access and to create logins for each node you want to setup by creating an authentication server that sits on the network. Create a user account, and use that account to setup nodes on the network rather than using your login for the node, it's much more secure this way.
I had in mind CPython 2.7, but didn't know either way for CPython 3 so left version number vague (I probably should have specified). Thanks for checking, I was too lazy to find a non-ascii character to check for myself.
Experience tells you roughly when to expect a nuance like this to show up or be relevant, but to know the details I just googled. This is not well documented because it is subject to change -- indeed my claim is not true anymore in CPython 3.
 &gt;&gt;git diff 
That's a really good point. I always thought that the genius of the blockchain technology was how it uses the previous block's hash in the current hash to chain it all together, thats just a part of the technology. The real genius is how to cryptographically ensure that there is consensus amongst the network without any trust at all. Is it correct for me to think so?
Python project: 2 Google searches, 100 lines of code. Java project: 12 Google searches, 500 lines of code. ;)
I'll be frank, fixing typos is a hella difficult task. You'd need a large database of words and/or phrases for the program to compare your input with. And even then, you'd have problems with uncommon words and abbreviations, as well as words that are really similiar to each other that could be mistaken as typos; say, "fore" (golf term) and "for". Of course, you wouldn't have time for that. Perhaps Google's APIs might be of use?
Nice ad
Wow, never seen so many python books together outside my shelves. I'd be bankrupt if I lived near bookstore that stocked a decent amount of programming books.
Woo, 3rd edition Nutshell is out.
Off to the side there's a book about bomb damage maps ... That would be interesting also
I can't image many kids are going to really care about population and salary demographics. Also, all of this stuff can be found in the pandas official docs and tutorials. This article doesn't bring anything new to the table.
If you are going to change `__hash__` you should probably update `__eq__` as well as to avoid unexpected behavior. 
Does anyone know if the crash course is worth getting for a Pynoob?
hmm I'm still going to have the javascript issue with wordpress as my CMS, thanks for pointing that out though.
[Shallow Copying](https://docs.python.org/2/library/copy.html) From the docs: Assignment statements in Python do not copy objects, they create bindings between a target and an object. For collections that are mutable or contain mutable items, a copy is sometimes needed so one can change one copy without changing the other
you placed "return" before the message, so function returns, and execution never reaches the "if quitter == False" line / print statement. 
&gt; In the second scenario, they change together, like they referring to the same thing. This is exactly what's happening. `one` and `two` both become names for the same object in memory.
&gt; I think the changes to Block are __hash__ and __getitem__, right? Yes. &gt; While __hash__ is useful for defining an object's hash as used by Python built-ins like sets and dicts, I think it's debatable whether it should be used in this case, as it's being used for a very specific purpose that may not require a hash with the same properties as those built-ins. It is debatable, and, in my opinion, there's no reason not to use it in this instance. &gt; As for __getitem__, it is my understanding that this is normally used to implement dynamic key-lookup like in lists and dicts (e.g. block['index']. Here's where I'll have to draw a firm line. The class is using index, timestamp, previous_hash, and hash as keys with their values as values. Hence, I've assumed this to be a dictionary, so why not use the same syntax? &gt; I'm not sure why you would use it in the way that you do. In fact you don't use the syntax implemented by this method in the code: you use namespace lookup instead (block.index). I copy-pasted the code without going through the rest of it with as fine-toothed a comb as is customary. My apologies for that. &gt; And arguably it would be better to have Block subclass object. New-style classes are [the default](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2588667/783412) now, rendering the explicit subclassing of object redundant.
I know its a bit delayed but I wanted to say thank you for helping me get past this! I ended up cleaning up the whole thing where I'm grabbing the verse of the day information so that I'm loading it from the json dict first, and then grab the information out of the dict and load it into the string form that I need. Your response really helped me figure out what was going on and where I needed to get to!
Thank you for this! Was able to get it working and this helped with the debug just like you said!
what javascript issue?

The book at the bottom right is by PM Heathcote, it's a pretty decent book for £13.00 I use it with some of my high school students. Heathcote has some brilliant comp sci books for gcse and a level if any one wants to learn more around the subject.
Foyle's is a wonderful bookstore.
I am :( but mainly because of amazon I seem to have a thing for buying coding books and not having enough time to read them.
No starch press has such a good selection of tech books. https://www.nostarch.com I got that python for kids book for my son.
I know python is great, but for use of Outlook specifically, probably due to company constraints, might want to look at using powershell instead. [technet forums](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/Lync/en-US/8f29830b-ac8d-48fe-bc45-701d508b3163/create-outlook-email-draft-with-html-formatting-using-powershell?forum=winserverpowershell) I believe that if you use save instead of send then it tries to save it to the default location for that item. Worth giving it a shot, and then writing a wrapper for it with python so you can extend it later.
Man, everyone talks about how ugly tkinter is, but it looks so nice on Macs. I don't own a Mac however, so ah well.
You can also run micropython on a ESP8266, which has wifi and everything on it, and you can get them for $3-7 if you look around. There was a talk at PyCon this year about this very subject.
Using ttk widgets it can be made to look almost as a native app on macOS. Especially if you are careful with some details and make a small effort to follow the Human Interface Guidelines and to understand what a user expects to find. Maybe in other platforms it can look fine. In my case, I am currently testing only on Mac, so I am pretty sure it will look awkward in Windows. ;) 
Consensus isn't necessarily part of a Blockchain. You can have a permissioned blockchain, where a central authority digitally signs a hash as being correct and the clients just accept things with a valid signature.
Really really cool! I'm playing through and I found a bug on the first level. The sign in front of the lava pit seems to let you go straight through the earth if you have any sort of momentum moving towards it on either side.

First scenario is "by value", second scenario is "by reference".
options of what? What is generateJSON()? What does your code look like? EDIT: also, the subreddit for this type of question is /r/learnprogramming.
The second part is the easiest: just call `.lower()` on your input string. The first part, you're gonna need five years and a research team. Not kidding.
I stumbled upon a page that outlined how autocorrect works in MS Word, it was an older page by someone who I think actually worked on the code. it worked by mapping out neighboring keys based on distance and doing some math to calculate the probability that the person intended x but pressed y. it was really clever. I don't have a link .. but .. it's out there.
Yes, it's open source. You could run it on heroku or even spin up an AWS EC2 instance and run it there. Or just set the flask address equal to "0.0.0.0" and host it locally. Google "host flask app publicly" for more info (your dash app.server is a flask server).
It may take a while of reading through Amazon comments but you can usually find a confirmed buyer who mentions it. But to be honest if a book is more than a few years old AND you see those comments, I would take their word for it if it is important to you. There always new books coming down the pipeline.
I think so, it has some cool projects that are way more interesting than any of the other intro books. Is it one of the ones that the author lets you read online for free, or not?
The A level book was definitely thick paper so make it bulk out more as a textbook. Definitely better than the alternatives though!
This is exactly what I needed. Thank you.
You ran ```from run import BibleBot``` so it will run ```run.py``` in order to import ```BibleBot```.
Yeah but run.py doesn't actually call the function BibleBot, it only defines it. That's why I'm confused.

There are some normal copies beneath it.

Yeah, collisions are hard to program bud, especially when they all get on top of eachother, I've been aware of it for a while. I've tried to fix it a few times, I just hope it isn't too game breaking 
I tried it and for me it seems like your problem is you used ```pack()``` and ```grid()``` within the same tkinter frame. You can only use one or the other.
I caught that and have since converted it them all to grid(). The BibleBot() function is still running on startup of ui.py. I'm pushing a new version to github right now with some corrections and changes.
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython.

Exactly this, there's weirdness when you put True, 1 and 1.0 into a dictionary in some versions of Python (purposefully being handwavey as I don't recall which off hand) because eq and hash are defined differently.
Which Google API are you referring to? 
&gt; Ssssssssss Nice.
I'll start with the one for kids then advance to the one for dummies. 
1. /r/learnpython 2. If you save your file with `json.dump`, then you already have a `dict`. I'm not sure why you want to edit the string.
Awesome..Do you have the GitHub link for the notebook?
Because I made multiple calls and saved them in the file together, so while each is a dict, they don't all compile into a single dict.
A little additional background: I've been working with data on the S&amp;P 500 lately and realized there isn't a good free resource for identifying the historical components of the S&amp;P 500. Since the index is adjusted at least quarterly, I needed the list of active tickers over time in order to pull data for each company in the index from sites like yahoo finance or quandl. The code posted is my inelegant but workable solution to parse the Wikipedia page that so kindly makes this information available. It turns out Wikipedia pages are pretty hard to scrape and parse. I didn't have much luck with the libraries available for general web scraping or parsing Wikipedia specifically, so I wound up grabbing the raw html from the site and parsing it myself with a little help from the lxml library. I think my method of using a single page request is compliant with Wikipedia's rules, so hopefully I'm not wrong on that one. On the Wikipedia page, the current tickers are in their own table, and the historical changes are in a separate table, so I had to parse them separately. I also traverse the lists more than I probably need to once I have the data parsed in order to make them easy to use for automated data retrieval later. Happy to hear if you have any feedback, know of a cooler way to address this problem, or if there's a library out there that parses tables in Wikipedia more efficiently. 
Thank you very much for such a detailed response! For now, it's a bit over my head though. I've just started learning myself but I think it's for the best to know or at least to keep in mind any strange or edge cases that I've just come across with!
So... You saved a lot of JSONs into one file without any separators like `\n` or `\t`? And now you are trying to read it?
Thank you! Yeah I guess it just comes as one learns, like programming idioms and the like.
I have the Crash Course book and the Automate the Boring Stuff book. Both are for beginners but I thought the Crash Course book was much better.
Find the one that choose the title and give him a raise and a medal because that sign is puntastic
Amazon has created some terrible habits for me. Books are so cheap and plentiful that I've not read about 80% of the books I buy. Talk about a first world problem... 
No, here is what it looks like: https://gist.github.com/davidshq/91f9b55a508ca565638655e0c1849889 I didn't include all of the results, way too lengthy.
I believe it's released under Creative Commons, so yes. I'll put a link up shortly. 
See if this works: http://ap-n.us/books/Programming/Python%20Crash%20Course.pdf Was going to wait until I got home but then I realized I was on the internet
As I see it you *did* save a lot of JSONs in one file... But things are easier since you formatted them. Anyway I recommend you to split the file into individual JSONs, parse them to `dict`, and do whatever you want.
I tried my solution: &gt;&gt;&gt; x = ' asdf asd;f' &gt;&gt;&gt; ''.join(x) is x False &gt;&gt;&gt; x.format() is x False 
Dunno if you've heard of it but you should check out hackhands as it sounds similar to what you're doing.
I don't know of any tools out there but one approach could be to take all the invalid words and replace with the closest/most popular known word based on its levenshtein distance.
Add a comma in front of each open-brace at the beginning of a line (except the very first one), and the put [ and ] around the entire file. This should do most of the heavy lifting, and you can do the rest in a text editor: `sed 's/^\{/,{/g' &lt; json.dump &gt; commas.dump` 
I think defaultdict is the right answer here but in the future you should take a look at the `setdefault` method that dictionaries have. It's often overlooked.
I'm using crash course now and it's the best resource I've used. It presents information at a great pace and I've found if fairly easy to stick with.
I use Google books. You get a pretty good sample for free before you buy and I always have my phone on me so I read more. 
I used this book after what sounds like a similar experience level with python. I think it was better at teaching me the basics of Python than anything I had done before. PyQt is pretty strong OOP which was different than what I had learned prior so it was an excellent move for me. Personally, unless you are experienced in programming in general or another language I would just stick to PyQt 4 so you do not have to spend the time reconciling the differences between 4 and 5 and you can focus more on just learning Python. TLDR; Just do it! Great Book!
Tkinter is probably a great place to start, especially if you want to play with text fields. That being said, I am going to recommend a non-Python solution for this: [PhraseExpress](http://www.phraseexpress.com). This is their bread and butter, and their scripting engine is top-notch. When I worked in phone tech support, I automated my top 10 most common call tickets with this program and it was butter smooth. Definitely worth checking out, IMO.
 def make_sound(c, n): return c.upper() + c * (n - 1) print(make_sound("s", 10))
For a simpler solution you might want to try YAML parser. It's more flexible than JSON might just work.
I would think you could knock something together pretty quickly using flask, minimal knowledge of forms and html. The web app is the route I would take. It would be a little more work than say a command line app or using tkinter, hower.
I would use flask to make a web app. 
Can you elaborate? Are you saying a YAML parser might be able to read the entire file without making changes?
I'm getting this error when I try to run that command: sed: -e expression #1, char 1: unknown command: `''
Why do u need to scrape the entire wikipedia page? Here are the one liner solution to fetch data from wiki table a) Use Pandas to read the table directly(pd.read_html) b) Read the data directly in Google Sheets, Check my blog (http://kanoki.org/2017/06/27/scrape-analyze-data-in-google-sheet-in-less-than-a-minute/)
Sorry, try without escaping the brace. (Between sed, PCRE and Emacs, I can never remember which characters need to be escaped...) `sed 's/^{/,{/g' &lt; json.dump &gt; commas.dump`
Maybe their next one can just say "Monty"

I really love that book. The authors style is thorough without focusing on the minutia that you'll learn naturally anyway. I now give it as a parting gift to interns.

Foyles used to be an amazingly wonderful bookstore. That old corner building with the maze of books you'd get lost in. I came out once with 'A course in mathmatics for students of physics book 2.' It was about £70, I couldnt find Book 1, but that wasnt important as I wasnt studying physics. Or maths. And I only went in for the newly released Chapterhouse Dune.. :(
Why not just use .title()? ("s"*10).title()
I learned a lot in that blue machine learning python book but that coding style was my least favorite by far.

Wow, I did not know this algorithm. Thank you, I'll apply this method to my is_prime_optimal.py.
It's starting to feel like the programming zeitgeist is finally starting to drop the guild mentality in many quarters. ...and then I have to compile something with Android Studio.
I don't know specifically as I don't use them much, but generally theirs would be what I'd expect to help in a situation where data is required.
You're welcome! Maybe use it only if the number to check is greater than a certain amount, like a million or something like that, because for small numbers it would be really slow compared to the one you already have.
What colorscheme are you using?
Isn't that the book that advocates python 2?
On the other hand I read all of them and now I think I know nothing
Not anymore, no. He released a version for Python 3 recently. I doubt it made his book any less shittier, though.
You can try deploying it via https://www.heroku.com as they have a free plan that allow you to run one application.
Glad to hear it helped :)
Oh man,my dad bought me that python for kids book years ago and that's what sparked my interest in coding...
Thanks for advice, I've learned new things from you :). I can optimize the my algorithm more efficiently with you advice!
Gald i helped!
Hey thank you for pointing it out, i was not aware of such a lib. I checked it out and it appears to work. I am posting a snippet for next poor soul that will arrive at this post in the future: import janus import asyncio loop = asyncio.get_event_loop() queue = janus.Queue(loop=loop) async def other_asynchronous_code(): for i in range(5): print(i) await asyncio.sleep(1) async def asynchronous_code(): await asyncio.sleep(2) await queue.async_q.put(42) queue.async_q.task_done() def synchronous_code(): return queue.sync_q.get() async def coroutine(): fut = loop.run_in_executor(None, synchronous_code) while not fut.done(): await asyncio.sleep(0.1) print(fut.result()) loop.run_until_complete(asyncio.gather(other_asynchronous_code(), asynchronous_code(), coroutine())) loop.close() Downside is that it increases code complexity quite a bit. But it seems this is the price to be paid for this usecase if we want to use native asyncio primitives and have a kosher code. I wish we could await from any normal `def`'ed functions as this seems a needless limitation at the moment. Maybe one day.
Why is YAML more flexible? It's easier to read, sure. But I don't see any real benefit outside of that?
You can try heroku/pythonanywhere/openshift, etc. A simple search will give numerous guides for deployment to any of the platform
He also put it behind a $30 paywall. And his “sample” consists of the first 8 exercises — the most boring ones that just call `print`. Great strategy.
Consensus *is* exactly what defines blockchain. I suggest you read about Paxos, it's fun. What you describe is not what a permissioned blockchain, in essence, is. I suggest you have a look at tendermint/monax. And you still do have validators. Also, regardless of the algorithm, what is interesting is again the way of consensus, not just "signing hashes". 
The Microsoft Speech Platform lets you define custom grammars. If you are going to go through the same limited vocabulary in the same order every time, as with the checkboxes, it could far improve your recognition compared to a plain dictation. I used it once to count things, so you could say "one of red, three of yellow" and it would accumulate. However, I had to wait after each phrase for a ding, which made it slower than speaking into a recording. I used the C# bindings.
What do you mean by "normal things"? Asynchronously reading files is actually surprisingly difficult. Doing it across multiple completely different operating systems is even more difficult. Asynchronously reading stdin isn't even _possible_ on some platforms.
That's how his whole book (the old one, at least) is written, there's like 20 print chapters. So his sample is honest.
I want to further extend it to my college project where I'll be using the data analytics part. For that MySQL will be convenient. Hence, the decision :)
 Thank you. 
normal things means means write/read files, find/insert mongodb, push/pop redis and etc. 
I find it is so strange that even there need a third part library for mongodb to operate MongoDB asynchronously. Why not just use pymongo? In golang, I should just use go function(){....} to implement asynchronous operations. But in python, it is so confused. 
Go's "goroutines" aren't async I/O, they're green threads. Go was also designed around green threads, and shipped with them as a major feature. Python doesn't have green threads, and async was only added fairly recently, after literal decades of language and ecosystem development.
I've never actually used programming *books*. It just seems to me like they're doomed to get dated. Actually, I did read Clean Code, but that was more on general... well, clean code.
You should see my Steam library.
The "How to Install Python on Ubuntu" is misleading for beginners. Python is already installed by default. Beginners should not be advised to manually download python and build it from source. 
Who speaks a programming language? That doesn't make any sense.
The new version is basically the same, with Flask instead of web.py. 
Well, for one thing, *pymongo* came out years before *async* became a full-fledged, first-class member of the language, and **pymongo** still needs to support a **significant** number of users who are not using Python 3, much less Python 3.5+, and even less again **async**. Odds are everything that *can* be asynchronous eventually *will* be... ironically you'll just have to wait on that future.
As stated already, it's an excellent book. Automate the boring stuff is excellent as well. I recommend both. Automate the boring stuff starts off a little quicker than crash course I feel personally, and you may enjoy that one first. Good luck. 
Might want to quote it for when bash.org goes down for months on end again. 
HHHHHSSSSSHSSS SSSSS
I had this problem, programming books didn't get me anywhere because I wasn't understanding it. You have to make sure you are actually doing stuff and making stuff.
I have like 600 games of which I've played 30 of them and of those 30 I'm probably more than 10% into 8 of them 
Hey, thanks for the help! I'll definitely check out your blog post. Unfortunately there are multiple tables on the page and I need two of them. Both of them are those sortable tables Wikipedia uses which cause lots of problems for scraping libraries. There are also lots of nested rows in one of the tables. These are two issues for pandas that make the data come out pretty junky in a data frame with the read.html command. Here's a link to the pandas issue on github if you're interested: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/7762 
Please, the Machine Learning and Finance books would be great!
actually, I'd like that if asynchrony of Python can be just like JavaScript. If you want, then you can. It is out of third part librarys' business-----every function can be asynchronous.
I would love that stack as well! :)
I'm working with 3.7 alpha from git master for a month, no problems so far \^_^
Well, if you speak parseltongue, it's pretty profane.
You should definitely learn things the manual way. You really want to know how all that stuff works internally before you use tools to automate it.
Steam sales! AKA traps.
When you start understand stuff it will be less fun to make stuff because to make it by the book will take magnitudes more time and you will feel guilt for cutting corners to get stuff out there to the point you would have needed therapy.
Can you remind me in 3 weeks? I'm away from my laptop until then. 
SAAMMMEEEEEE
Apologies for that. Just want to cover the installation process. 
The things I learned in "Fluent Python" and "Effective Python" were the shortcuts. So much of it was not only easier to do it the right way, but was also using pre-built and pre-tested and incredibly-optimized code.
police!!! we've got one...
I use QML with PyQt5 and I find it easier to write it by hand.
Well, you're in luck... [async def](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html) is now a builtin, and asynchronous operations are a full, first class part of the language. That doesn't mean it's been adopted by each and every third party library in the entire ecosystem. Now, that said, every day, and in absolutely every way, I thank Turing himself that Python isn't *just like* EcmaScript.
Is what you're looking for different than multiprocessing threads? from multiprocessing import Pool def f(x): return x*x p = Pool(5) print(p.map(f, [1, 2, 3]) That'll run asynchronously **edit** - Whoa, go's "channels" are cool! Thanks for causing me to look this up. https://gobyexample.com/channels
it'd be nice to have file and stdin asynchronicity to be at least available as a library with native file async for where it works and executor-patterned fallbacks for other plattforms. sadly, someone has yet to write that ttbomk.
Definitely learn how to do it by hand. Once you're reasonably proficient at that, use the productivity tools. The tools are great, and could save you lots of time, but knowing the toolkit is essential.
If I never saw another Django Blog example it would too soon.
I am working through this now, getting back to Flask and just getting into React. I am looking forward to integrating Flask + React. So far, excellent!
Learn to write it by hand -- you'll honestly save yourself a lot of headache. And I don't just mean that in a "you'll see it's worth it in the long-run" kinda way (although that also is true), but it ends up being easier in the short-run too. I do at times use RAD UI apps to do visual mock-ups while I'm trying to visualize what kind of layout I want -- but then I just hand-write in the end anyway to save myself the frustration of trying to make the one-size-fits-all solution actually work for me.
Cheers! Starting part 5 now. Let me know if there is anything that you'd like to see. http://testdriven.io/part-five-intro/
When I search for packages from PyPl I'm getting a bunch of options, is there a particular package I should be installing for the parser? e.g. yaml, yaml-1.3, pyYAML?
beat me to it, ya fuck
Architecting for scale can be done with queues. a small number of link scrapers post links to an AWS SQS queue. Then a larger group of image downloaders can fetch links from this queue and download them into an S3 data bucket. run docker containers on ec2 instances
You can use the tool to familiarize yourself with object names, but write it yourself. You'll have cleaner code and you'll learn to organize it such that's it's easy to tweak things.
YAML is a superset of json. It saved my ass many times dealing with bad formatted JSONs. &gt;&gt;&gt; yaml.load("[{'a': 1}, {b: 2}]") [{'a': 1}, {'b': 2}] &gt;&gt;&gt; yaml.load("a: 1,\n'b': 2") {'a': '1,', 'b': 2} 
Regardless of whether you use the designer, you need to know how to handcode it. The designer can only get you so far, and even once you load the UI file into code, you need to understand how to interact with the objects in code. So either way you need to learn to manually code some of the interface. Think of the designer as something that let's you do less work in the future once you know qt well. Don't use it as a crutch

Lol, most commenters here aren't even noticing the sign, amirite? 
Thanks for sharing, but I think /r/learnpython is more appropriate for another django blog tutorial.
Thanks for doing this, so far I was just reading. Wondering if my raspberry can be a micro service or it go to be a full server for all of the services.
Just a shoutout that the 'Python Crash Course' book is seriously good. Engaging from the start, I'm lucky enough to have used a previous language before starting with Python (Java) - but my friend had no such experience. The crash course book got him set up with solid coding theory from the start. So, I recommend it ahaaha
Looks almost the same as "chrome no internet" game.
Never used robot framework, or had to do any desktop automation, but I'm pretty sure you can use API to get google spreadsheets data. And screenshots are easy with selenium. Is Balsamiq the reason you need it to be a "Desktop" automation?
Yeah, that was goal, a remake.
[This should solve it](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8551735/how-do-i-run-python-code-from-sublime-text-2)
Thanks! Do you recommend using Sublime to run the code as well or use another program/package to execute the code? (For a new programmer to python)
Good to know it works on 3.x... why do they advise to run it from 2.7 then ? (http://www.web2py.com/init/default/download). Web2py got me started on python web dev back in the day, and I'm sure it did for many others... I never understood the hate.
nek 
I use Sublime only to write the code and then execute it via the cmd prompt (since I'm on Windows). But I'll be using PyCharm (this is an IDE) in the next coming days since I'm tired of using two things for Python. 
Not sure if this requires a PEP - it's just a small feature in the standard library. If I were you, I'd just submit a pull request and see what happens - the implementation should be pretty simple.
Wow! Will do
I do all the time. I have multiple build scripts for different Python virtual environments that I have on my machine. What OS are you on?
Whats cool is schools are starting to teach python as one of the core classes pretty early on. I was talking to my cousin over there (10yrs old) and she was telling me about her programming class and the kind of projects they are doing.
I'm sure this has been reposted a million times on Reddit and most of y'all have seen it, but there is a word for this: http://www.openculture.com/2014/07/tsundoku-should-enter-the-english-language.html
They'll probably ask you to write a PEP :P but having an implementation is always a very good thing for a PEP
&gt; Can you tell me, how to read a file by Python 3.6's async await? You can't with the `io.file` because `file.read` is not awaitable. So unless you want to use an alternative file io module... pfft... then yeah async is rather annoyingly "useless." What I find myself doing is using the async together with the `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` (basically an async friendly wrapper around `multiprocessing.pool`) to establish a async master process with a bunch of non-async worker slaves. The real issue that I see is not so much that the `io` module isn't async friendly, but that async is just the wrong model for async operations. If you really want to support async, then everything needs to be awaitable, and the exception should be the operation that is not awaitable. Instead we have a system where you can push asynchronicity into your app, but only so far, until you run into some other library or function which is not async aware. At that point your entire app loses all the benefits of async.
What do you mean by "build" exactly?
Windows 10! I am an engineer and I mainly use Matlab for computational purposes. If you are unfamiliar with it you write and execute code all within the program. I really want to start playing with python, and I like the feel of ST3, but I was curious if just using the Build option to run the programs is good enough for someone that just wants to play with code and test things!
As far as I know, in ST3 when you use the "Build" option, it executes your code within ST3. However I could be wrong, but every time I try to use "Build" on my code I get a error for it not being able to execute the code
So you get an error.. and you haven't written that error here? That's probably where you went wrong. 
[Release Notes](https://docs.python.org/3.6/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-6-2) * [Security] bpo-30730: Prevent environment variables injection in subprocess on Windows. Prevent passing other environment variables and command arguments. * [Security] bpo-30694: Upgrade expat copy from 2.2.0 to 2.2.1 to get fixes of multiple security vulnerabilities including: CVE-2017-9233 (External entity infinite loop DoS), CVE-2016-9063 (Integer overflow, re-fix), CVE-2016-0718 (Fix regression bugs from 2.2.0’s fix to CVE-2016-0718) and CVE-2012-0876 (Counter hash flooding with SipHash). Note: the CVE-2016-5300 (Use os-specific entropy sources like getrandom) doesn’t impact Python, since Python already gets entropy from the OS to set the expat secret using XML_SetHashSalt(). * [Security] bpo-30500: Fix urllib.parse.splithost() to correctly parse fragments. For example, splithost('//127.0.0.1#@evil.com/') now correctly returns the 127.0.0.1 host, instead of treating @evil.com as the host in an authentification (login@host).
Unfortunately I cannot post it until I get back to my laptop, I agree that would help and I will edit the post when I can get the error. I just posted to get an opinion for a novice python programmer if I should download more than just ST3 to run my codes!
You don't need anything but a command line and Python to run Python. 
Looks pretty good, you guys did a nice job maintaining a clean project structure. A few suggestions: &amp;nbsp; ----- # [Properties](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property) Use properties instead of manual setters &amp; getters.&amp;nbsp; Some of the checks you're doing are redundant, and this will also make the points of use more concise.&amp;nbsp; If you need to reference the stored value within the getter/setter, you can use `self._&lt;propertyname&gt;`. ### Before: class dino(): def __init__(self, position, type, lives=1, smoothness_rate=0.3): ... self.__coins = 0 ... def get_coins(self): return self.__coins def set_coins(self, value, type='default'): if (type is 'default'): self.__coins = value if (type is 'increment'): self.__coins += value &amp;nbsp; self.dino.set_coins(self.prize.value(), type='increment') ### After: class Dino: _coins = 0 @property def coins(self): return self._coins @coins.setter def coins(self, value:int): self._coins = value &amp;nbsp; dino = Dino() dino.coins &gt;&gt;&gt; 0 dino.coins = 10 &gt;&gt;&gt; 10 dino.coins += 3 &gt;&gt;&gt; 13 &amp;nbsp; self.dino.coins += self.prize.value() &amp;nbsp; ---- # [Abstract Base Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html) Clean up your game loop by implementing an abstract `Scene` class and using the `run` method to encapsulate each screen's functionality. Additionally, you could also implement `enter` &amp; `exit` methods to better handle each scene's lifecycle. ### Before: while self.game_running: self.display.clear() ... if (self.actual_scene == 'main_menu'): if self.dino: self.dino.reset() (self.game_running, self.actual_scene, self.extra) = self.display.show_menu(self.actual_scene) ... ### After: from abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod class Scene(metaclass=ABCMeta): @abstractmethod def run(self, app): pass class MenuScene(Scene): def run(self, app): if app.dino: app.dino.reset() (app.game_running, app.actual_scene, app.extra) = app.display.show_menu(app.actual_scene) &amp;nbsp; while self.game_running: self.display.clear() self.scene.run(self) 
Oh, that's interesting, good to know if I ever need to use the Wordpress API :) This will probably annoy some people, but I often use Pandas as a shortcut for converting between a list of JSON objects and CSV - you can pass it a list of JSON objects and it will create a DataFrame - then just use the to_csv to write to CSV: import pandas as pd import requests import time url = "https://api.wordpress.org/plugins/info/1.1/?action=query_plugins&amp;request[browse]=popular&amp;request[page]=%s" plugins = [] # just looping through 3 times, you will use the value in # data['info']['pages'] for your end point for page in range(1,4): r = requests.get(url % page) data = r.json() for plugin in data['plugins']: plugins.append(plugin) time.sleep(1) Then create the DataFrame: df = pd.DataFrame(plugins) and write the CSV: df.to_csv('test.csv') 
Ssssssssssss lmfao
I'm currently working on a flask app that helps with learning guitar. I made a code that can determine the key of a guitar or bass tab that you give it. You can also save the results to see a full fretboard with the key signature highlighted and other info on the key signature if your a member of the site. Right now I have it so if your not a member you can still use the key finder just not save them. It's been really fun so far and has taught me a lot.
that seems excessive 
what's new in 3.7?
Hmm. Out of Devil's Advocacy, what's wrong with just adding a **Filter** to your **Handler** that checks if a given **LogRecord.exc_info** attribute is a tuple or None? Or setting a **Formatter** subclass with a **formatException** method that always returns the empty string? Asking because you'll get the question on a PEP; the odds are good that the existing defaults would remain, so turning on your behavior would require programmer intervention... given that, what is too complicated about existing means of effecting the same change, or what security, performance, etc gain is provided by your proposed changes?
First result for python 3.7: https://docs.python.org/3.7/whatsnew/3.7.html 
That's only part of the changelog for release candidate 2. The full changeset is shown in the following link. Not earth shattering like how 3.6.1 was but it does have a lot of bugfixes. https://docs.python.org/3.6/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-6-2
Ah, good catch! Thanks
In Python, variable names are "labels", not "boxes". If you do `one = 'some value'`, the object `'some value` gets a label pointing to it called "one". If you use `one`, Python knows you really mean "whatever object the label "one" is attached to". If you do `two = one`, Python puts the label "two" on the object that has the label "one" attached. So now that object has two labels, "one" and "two". `set.copy` creates a new set object that contains the same items as the original set.
C has by-val and by-ref, in Python however everything is by-object-identity.
Balsamiq, screenshot manipulation, photoshop. In general if I could seamlessly manipulate my desktop and web I'd be able to automate a lot of work I do.
Thanks for that!
I dont want it to ignore exceptions, just the stack trace
Wasn't entirely clear; the Filter would ignore, the Formatter would not append traceback to the error message.
Finding problems that others are too lazy to automate tends to make me good money. :)
Do you have an example?
what problems do you usually automate?
https://www.fullstackpython.com/web-frameworks.html do you not have access to the sidebar?
You bet!
Use Atom instead.
Typically tooling within our company. Removing error prone manual work with automation to make it faster and less issues. I can't speak specifics, but taking something that takes 45 minutes and turning it into 5 minutes via APIs is rather rewarding. 
Submitting a talk proposal to PyGotham 2017!
It would be excessive if Excel wasn't terrible
Programming in teams. Learning how and why you need to test everything. Discovering CI and CD. Fiddling with far too many new things hoping they'll solve a problem they typically only make slightly less painful. Arguing with people who call themselves sys admin because they've finished an online course on Active Directory and can reliably copy and paste commands from Stack Overflow. Listening to managers say the word "Agile" a lot, although invoking it always seems to lead to a general slowdown and *even more meetings*. Oh, and constantly tripping over something that shells out to Perl, which shells out to TCL, which calls a shared library written in C, which uses popen to launch a Python process... but I'm in Visual Effects, and probably digress.
Do they ever accept changes like this which are not strictly necesary but seem very common and useful? Adding a new formatter seems like something not everyone would want to do
for a price
A book on the front end of a language, its syntax, will definitely get dated and probably quite quickly. But books on concepts, and the back end of a language so to say, will forever be treasure troves.
If you're a novice, you'll need IRC.
Generally if you don't have the knowledge or willpower to maintain your own VPS and be a devops as well a developer (as this can be quite daunting), probably best to go for something like Heroku. If your app is small enough you might be able to get it for free, but will pay for it once you scale out later. As services like Heroku tend to be more expensive than a VPS but that is because you have to do a lot less server maintenance which you should normally get a sysadmin for or become a devops. I love maintaining my own Linode VM, but that is because devops stuff doesn't scare me. I do know there are plenty of devs though that would rather concentrate on development and either leave the devops stuff to a proper sysadmin, or go with something like Heroku.
What is IRC, what does it do?
Internet Relay Chat. To get in touch with the community.
Google-Cloud-Speech-Api :(
The final proof that Python is taking over world domination.
I assume the one called "Bomb Damage Maps" is about going through kernel memory dumps?
I did what you describe once. Unfortunately, I did it in VBA. It worked, just created a bunch of email files that could be opened and mailed.
Look into Selenium, best way I've found to take site screenshots. Then use the Twitter API. See if the site you're trying to scrape has a RSS feed, that'll make checking for updates much easier.
They didn't fix https://bugs.python.org/issue27867

never do ``sudo make install`` this will clobber your system python, potentially making your Linux installation unusable or even unbootable. You should just ``apt install python3`` and use that, or if you really have to build your own for some reason, ``make alt-install`` instead
There was a python-lawyer fest on this very sub recently, which would probably illuminate.
I tried all 6 examples under Win 10 / Python 3.6.2 64-bit and did not see any crashes. The only 'error' I noticed was on the 4th example. The output I get is: Traceback (most recent call last): File "R:\Temp\4.py", line 7, in &lt;module&gt; b[0:64:X()] = [0]*32 ValueError: attempt to assign sequence of size 32 to extended slice of size 2 Why do you think I am not seeing any of these issues? 
that's listed under release candidate 1?
You want to look into David Beazley's [curio](https://github.com/dabeaz/curio) library. It's about "async all the way down" just as you say.
&gt; So unless you want to use an alternative file io module... pfft... then yeah async is rather annoyingly "useless." [Good news](https://github.com/dabeaz/curio).
Sure, they do accept non-breaking changes that enhance the language, all the time. They tend to do so through the PEP process so those changes that get incorporated have been considered, validated, and debated, unless the changes fix open issues, previously unknown bugs, etc, or are generally non-substantive (spelling mistakes in docstrings, things like that). What your talking about may very well be something that others may second, so I'm not in any way trying to discourage you, it's just that you will be asked "why not a Filter or Formatter", and if they don't accept your answer then you've got to remember that saving 10-15 lines of code on the client side isn't really a major concern of the *language*, especially in a library that has gotten more than its fair share of documentation to explain just how easy it is to effect this sort of a change.
Thanks to this i will be the new superstar of the company. Thanks OP
Its still pretty limiting though as any library you use also has to use curio. If I want to use pandas, does it support curio's asynchronous api? I just think the whole approach is ultimately wrong. If you want to go async in any kind of language that has any notion of a virtual machine, you should go async all the way down. Every python opcode should be considered to be awaitable, and the exception should be those operations that explicitely say "I'm not awaitable, and this chunk of ops have to be done as a chunk."
&gt;I just think the whole approach is ultimately wrong. You then go on to describe basically exactly what curio is going for. [Clicky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-1Y4kSsAFc).
So there is no teacher, no instruction, and no help... you just get a list of problems to solve and then they show you *their* solution at the end? They get to charge money for this?
Okay. Thanks
I'm not interested in watching a video. Are you saying that I can somehow inject/hotpatch curio into pandas library code and override the io module, and cause a non-async function like pandas.read_table to suddenly be awaitable? I don't know how that would work.
VERY interested to see where this takes you!
Replying for the source to more python knowledge. Specifically Machine Learning
can you please tell me how i can change if it need be?
&gt;I'm not interested in watching a video Why should I help you if you won't help yourself? Don't bother answering.
I use atom on a day to day basis for Python, Markdown, and LaTeX. I haven't ever manually edited my init.coffee nor do I need to manually set the file grammar. If I ask atom to open a .py file, the associated grammar is automatically selected. Isn't there an option somewhere to just auto detect file grammar when opening? Its never something I set manually
Read the sidebar. Questions go in /r/learnpython, not here. And never post screenshots or images of code. 
I second this. I still find myself coding by hand because it helps me to really learn the application framework. If you whip something up in Designer and are having trouble getting it working, it may not be obvious to you what the issue is if you are relatively unfamiliar with the Qt framework. You'll find it easier to debug your project as you go if you are writing the code by hand. There are certain aspects of the Qt framework that the designer will not help you learn (to my knowledge). The QThread system comes to mind.
I do signal processing &amp; comp vision and switched over to Python a few years ago from Matlab. So I totally get you! You can use Python in the two main ways you run Matlab inside the Matlab environment. You can run Python in an interactive shell, which is basically equivalent to the command window from Matlab. Otherwise using a text editor like Sublime and building is basically equivalent to using the editor and running in Matlab. You can also use an IDE which overall will be familiar to Matlab. Matlab is both a language and an IDE. Python is just a language, so you can use a separate IDE like PyCharm or Spyder if you want the environment (where you can see e.g. the values of variables).
I would say the size of the code base. In commercial software or even enterprise, the code can reach millions of lines and you can have several teams working on different parts. Some of these project can be very old and riddled with technical debt.
Well, that led me to the fix. I was saving the files as plain text rather than .py files. As soon as I rename them to xxxxxx.py, the grammar automatically changes. Thanks!
don't forget documentation!
Go check this weeks humble bundle. You can often get a lot of useful books for cheap. 
The problem is you imported run.py and in your run.py you have the function called at the very bottom so it's going to run when imported to avoid this use if __name__ == "__main__": Somefunction() in scripts you plan to use as modules 
The ones I care most about so far: - New function `os.register_at_fork()` allows registering Python callbacks to be executed on a process fork. (Contributed by Antoine Pitrou in bpo-16500.) - `urllib.parse.quote()` has been updated to from RFC 2396 to RFC 3986, adding ~ to the set of characters that is never quoted by default. (Contributed by Christian Theune and Ratnadeep Debnath in bpo-16285.) - `contextlib.asynccontextmanager()` has been added. (Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in bpo-29679.) - The `os.fwalk()` function has been sped up by 2 times. This was done using the `os.scandir()` function. - Optimized case-insensitive matching and searching of regular expressions. Searching some patterns can now be up to 20 times faster.

Hey, I don't think I have that one. I edited my post and it has a list of what I have. Let me know if you're still interested.

Perhaps Firebase real-time database would be worth looking into for this kind of project. Couple it with your microframework of choice (e.g. Flask) and you should be good.
I actually just figured out the problem. It wasn't actually running the main function, because the part of the script that connects to the twitch server wasnt in a function. So that ended up being the problem, it was connecting and looked like it was running the full script because of the way it connects and returns to console. 
The biggest change for me was the knowledge of how much more is involved in software development than coding. Planning is important, testing is important, as you might expect. However, managing relationships with other developers and teams is very important sometimes with respect to division of labor and setting expectations with regards to scheduling related changes and sometimes with respect to politics. As you learn more and your scope increases you learn that you can have a large impact without writing code and without being in a managerial position.
It depends on how close the matches are and what types of patterns occur when a non-exact match occurs. For instance, when the pattern is pretty predictable you might just have to remove stop words such as [in this package](https://github.com/portfoliome/cenaming). For something more advanced and if you have some time to tinker with training data, I would [probablepeople](https://github.com/datamade/probablepeople) as an example that is built off parserator. fuzzywuzzy uses Levenshtein Distance which I haven't found to be ideal for your use case. For instance, it will overweight stop words out of the box. Postgres's tsvector is probably better suited out of the box than fuzzywuzzy and I can point you to a resource if you are familiar with postgres? 
You could probably run all services from a single pi. It would be fun to run a Swarm Cluster across a number of pis. 
The sample looks more like it's taken directly out of a database, so why wouldn't I just query the database directly, rather than involving sql at all? I guess if you worked somewhere that had just used excel for years, building it into a defacto database, maybe it would be helpful to be able to do this. But I think you'd still be better off importing your workbooks into a database and querying it directly.
This is long, but it's pretty much what you need to follow to [get Python working on Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html); ultimately all you need is a terminal (CMD.exe will do) and a text editor.
Awesome, thanks! 
I will look into Heroku for sure. Thanks!
Thanks. I will check these out. 
I'm thinking about what sorts of things would be necessary to create a "Digital Aristotle" type of program (see cgpgrey's video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vsCAM17O-M)). Right now, I'm thinking about a starting method, which is to combine Khan Academy's [problem/understanding check system](http://david-hu.com/2011/11/02/how-khan-academy-is-using-machine-learning-to-assess-student-mastery.html) and YouTube's video collection with a machine learning algorithm that checks your performance on problem checks and herds you towards videos by that channel and of that style. I'm thinking videos of a similar style can be determined by looking at the users who follow that channel and seeing what other channels they follow.
happy to help
What does the "int" means here? @coins.setter def coins(self, value:int): self._coins = value
I won't. 
I think that to autoload your drafts in outlook like you describe you will either need a way to encode html into whatever binary format outlook uses, or you will need outlook to do it for you. I'm not familiar with a solution in python for the former. For the latter, you may be able to do it by finding a library that provides python bindings for the win32/COM API. I believe it is calked like pywin32 or something, but it is hardish to find on source forge or wherever. I have no real experience with this, but I seem to recall tat even though the hosting/docs suck, it was written by mark hammond, who is thanked explicitly in the cpython for windows installer abd would generally be considered an expert.
It's a [**Type Hint**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html), stating that the variable `value` should be of type `int`.&amp;nbsp; They're useful for IDE's that show [**Parameter Info**](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/viewing-method-parameter-information.html), and you can also use [**mypy**](http://mypy-lang.org/) to ensure that they are properly assigned.
I know Python's multiprocessing and multiprocessing.dummy. However, Coroutine is the solution for some problem.
No no no, io is just an example. What I need is Coroutine for everything.
No no no. In fact IO is just an example. What I want is Coroutine for everything. Not only about IO, but also any third part lib and any function I writed.
Infact， IO is just an example. What I want is Coroutine for everything.
Hello With ' ' , you are assigning them as string So when you "add" them it will concatenate the string hence returning '34' that is also a string To assign number, remove the ' ' around the numbers :) Code : num_owls_A = 3 num_owls_B = 4 Total_owls = num_owls_A + num_owls_B 
You should try to open the javascript console to see if there are any errors that happen when it should be showing the graph. In chrome, you can show this by going to the 3 dot menu on the right side of the browser -&gt; more tools -&gt; developer tools, then click the console tab. Reload your page, and you'll *probably* see an error there that can help out. If you don't see anything, I normally would start putting log messages in my javascript code, to see where things aren't working. In javascript, if you type console.log("my message here"); you can see those messages in the console from earlier. Anyway, good luck!
Hey thanks for the reply, but that is the original problem, I'm not assigning them as strings, they are already assigned as a string. So that's what I'm stuck on because they are being added like that and I need to add them as integers. 
No no no... what you just said?!
Answer = int(variableA) + int(variableB)
Supposed to be in /r/learnpython, see note in sidebar
python2 :|
I was looking for that in Firefox, thanks for the tip
As above said convert the string to integer, and if you need the result in string convert the total with str(total) 
I think you know what did I say.
I'm leaning towards the flask option. Although books got me started, I have definitely found that learning through doing useful projects is the fastest way to go. In the long run, I bet I'll get more use out of the flask experience than tkinter. Thanks for the recommendation.
wow...I swear I googled the crap out of this and I never came across this app. I definitely want the experience of stumbling through a project on my own, but that software is cheap enough that I can at least have a working solution while I figure out my own project. Thanks for turning me on to that.
reading and understanding code made by other people
Absolutely! I hope it works well for what you need!
I will submit another thought. If you are allowed read only access to a database, but have limited permission to query it (overloaded database thats sensitive/policy reason), and you can't install a database locally to pull the data into and then work with it from there (due to technical or policy reasons), then pulling into excel and treating it like a flat db is probably your next best option. Honestly this probably isn't too far of a stretch in a lot of companies.
[The golden moment](https://youtu.be/v75rNdPukuI?t=1530)
r/learnpython
Let me update the blog. Thanks a lot
How does pulling it into Excel help any of those situations vs what you could do without Excel?
I do the same the other side of this is when the companies you do it for start letting people go. I mean I get but it still bothers me more then it should.
I reverse engineer networking protocols and malware.
No. 
A lot of companies send out weekly reports. This could involve pulling data from various different sources and populating some pretty XLSX sheets somebody made. From what I have seen python is always an option, but rarely is it the best option. Still great to learn because it is either a good intro language or good for a jack of all trades type role.
I've definitely worked in environments where the data is locked down like that, and we've kept large worksheets of data locally instead. But in those same places where security and permissions are so limited, I can't usually install python and/or add ins either. Fortunately I'm not in that situation anymore but it would be nice to have a tool like this if I ever find myself there again.
It probably doesn't, but you have to take personalities into consideration. I can pull whatever data using a query in Excel, but my IT guy would never let me near the database directly. 
A while back I modified a game boy emulator to have online players join and walk around your game and battle on the original Pokemon Red rom. It's really crazy what you can do once you have access to the console's memory.
euthereum is basically that
Basically you can find yourself in a position where you aren't allowed to hit the Database, but your "SysAdmin" (read: MSP that Finance trusts more than internal staff) is allowed to do a hacky dump using a query you have written so that you can dump into Excel or something similar. Just saying, sometimes the policies make no sense, and using the "Well I'll could just do it in Excel", often calms those who find anything outside of excel to be dark and full or terrors.
Edit: Sorry in my half asleep haze I didn't see the part about the webcam. When I had a similar project, I couldn't find a simple way to do this with a camera. I just ended up getting a cheap bar code reader. They are interpreted by the Rpi as being a keyboard and since it is USB you can still connect a camera to the pi. It worked great and was very easy to implement on the pi. 
I am a self taught devloper and I just started my first dev job a year and a half ago so I have some fresh issues some of which I still struggle with. I work on 100+ person international team developing a B2B BI tool. I use SQL for work but you will find similar hurdles with other languages. * It took me 3 months to learn how to do the job I signed up for. * Of our whole project, I am comfortable with 20%, spotty on 30%, in the dark on 50% * With a personal project, you can go through every line of code to find an issue. On a commercial project, you might not even be able to get access to all of the servers * Even if you do have access to all the code 80% of it is in a language you aren't familiar with * Hacking a program together is more fun than fixing bugs or developing the same code in different colors for a new client. 
While it's a cool presentation, it's more about lua and hex than it is Python.
Personally I like powershell for working with csv files https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/stefan_stranger/2011/02/08/compare-two-different-csv-files-using-powershell/ 
It's ok friend, you aren't alone. I do have a switch to Python 3 scheduled for the remainder of our codebase by the end of the year. I only have a handful of packages to finish updating, and after the switch from wx3 to qt5 I'll be able to finish the job on our main application too. Should be a seamless switch over from 2.7 to 3.6, just in time for 3.7 to come out...
I rather enjoyed that.
The twilio integration was the most interesting part to me.
His error hex check failed spectacularly.
Yes, absolutely. SQL is one of those things where you get the basics down very easily, but its a rabbit hole for the more advanced stuff. If you're trying for a data science career, I'd get to the point where you'd feel comfortable querying a database knowing its schema.
OP are you the author of the blog post? I found it interesting but I felt like I didn't have enough of an overview on Cryptocurrencies to really enjoy it. Do you know of any good sources from a programmers perspective that are a 'level' above this depth? Then I will give it a re-read.
90 percent of the job isn't Python.
I am not the author. Computerphile has some YouTube videos about Bitcoin and blockchain. I watched them but they're not Computerphile's best. You might get more out of them though.
And https://getnikola.com/
[citation needed]
I recommend the [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf) by Satoshi Nakamoto, and [Mastering Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook) by Andreas Antonopoulos. Both are available for free online. 
Oh yeah: https://github.com/atom-minimap/minimap/issues/588 Read the comment by jlozano. Kite is a great idea, but their disinterest in security, and now this garbage makes me think it's actually a scam.
If you want it to have any traction you will have to convince people that your cryptocurrency offers something that other, more well-established, currencies do not. Creating it as an experiment would definitely be a worthwhile endeavor if you are up for it... then eventually when you see an opportunity to really offer something novel in the space then you will have the experience to do so. Either way, good luck!
One of the OP's points in the article was that there would be no smart contracts, so it wouldn't be much like Ethereum.
I read the thread earlier. I didn't see anything about code theft. 
There are definitely Python jobs where you don't need advanced math. Web development, for example, barely uses any.
Huh? Please explain
There was a thread on here a few months ago where they were quizzed about it and wouldn't provide any details to show they don't mine users' code... I'll try to dig it up. 
3blue1brown has YouTube videos that give a good top level overview of how this all works. They're for a lay audience, but include sufficient technical details for a programmer to implement the thing. Just watch at 2x if it's too slow!
Yeah those services looked really nice but a cloud completion system. Mmmmh no thanks. I'll stay with pycharm then.
Programming math isn't the same math as you do in school. You don't need to know how to do long division or long multiplication. Regardless, you can learn. Being "bad at math" is just what lazy people tell themselves to justify their lack of effort.
I read somewhere that FATpython is going to be integrated in 3.7, is it the case?
Just a little warning, most python video libraries use ffmpeg as a backend, depending on your environment that might not be available or it could be installed, but lacking some codecs necessary for your purpose. If possible I would suggest using ffmpeg directly since extracting the audio from mp4 is a one-liner any library just adds unnecessary complexity, maybe set up a task queue and do the decoding as a background job. I might get flamed for this but if available I'd just setup a cron job which decodes all files in a directory into another one without any python code involved at all. Something like (only syntactically correct and working): ls $videodir | grep .mp4 | xargs ffmpeg -hide_banner OPTIONS I dont know the correct flags and options off the top of my head, i think you only need to specify input, output file and you can specify sampling rate and codec maybe. You could of course just wrap that call in a python script, might be better for error handling.
I program mostly in Python. I develop web based GUIs, servers and software that interacts with hardware (Autopilots and other onboard systems). It's quite cool. I have a plethora of different projects on my hands but most of them are small (&lt;10k lines of code usually).
"euthereum" does not exist. 
Complexity; sheer volume of code. Having to deal with legacy throughout the stack, throughout the data model. Shady, Rube Goldberg-like devops setups. A lot of your experience will vary by compact

Thanks! Could I install ffmpeg on localhost and have python monitor a local folder and upload the rss feed and mp3 files via FTP? App wont update unless my PC is on, but it's free. I'm also going to contact the news service, see if they can provide that feed in audio format.. would be a quicker fix. Didn't think of that yesterday, but when Amazon starts to officially sell Echo's in the Netherlands, they may want to do this anyway..
But dogecoin does
Hi I read somewhere that the biggest change to python 3 was the print statement using parentheses this time around. Are there any other differences that are significant in improving the objective you set out to solve?
This is absolute bullshit. It won't work and is stupid.
Don't fake. I put this up 2 mins ago. No way in hell did u doall that in 1 minute
I can read the code, I don't need to run it to know it's bullshit.
As a casual coder, GIL?
It runs the website too many times. That's what makes it lag
Yes, but crashing your computer with too many browser tabs won't make you admin, ever.
It worked for us.u force log off the computer by the button. I also doubt u are on a school computer
It's a lot more likely your school computer is just configured to log into the administrator account by default.
Meh. Anyway, even if it doesn't work, it's still quite funny to do.
With localhost you are refering to your computer? Your app probably won't available to the internet? Here is how i would do it: * One script to download the episodes (use requests if necessary) and store them in a folder * Another script to create the .mp3 files. Use subprocess library to call ffmpeg on the command line, os.listdir and fnmatch.filter to get the files in the video folder. Cleanup the folder by deleting the .mp4 files. * Build whatever frontend you need to deliver the mp3s Sure you can install ffmpeg: On Windows you probably need to put into the PATH on linux you just need to install ffmpeg itself and codecs (gstreamer). Both should be available from you package manager. On fedora/CentOS/Redhat systems you need to enable nonfree repositories for the codecs.

We can't not mention 'Effective Python' by Brett Slatkin. It is always on my desk when i am working.
That is the least of my compatibility issues. I use the print function import from future module, and your code shouldn't be littered with prints anyway. Other issues include: - meta classes have different syntax - import queue instead of import Queue, several other things renamed too - unicode strings by default, and `u'{}'.format(b'')` has surprising behavior. I specifically need bytes a lot, this gets annoying to track down - division is different, I have to explicitly handle integer division as a separate thing, and when you want to overload division for custom types this is confusing - lots of things return iterators instead of lists - unicode strings by default, while changing how bytes behaves - super isn't so super to use in 2.7 - can't take advantage of python 3 features like yield from, return from generators, keywords only args, type annotations, new style classes by default (I still have to inherit from object), and a few other small things scattered about - compiled extensions can be a pain in the butt when supporting 2 and 3 - did I mention unicode vs bytes? This is also just what I can remember off the top of my head early in the morning. There are probably other caveats I can't remember right now. 
Thank you very much! If they don't want to create the skill themselves, but give me the OK to do it (not sure what copyright license they release the original feed under..?), I'm going to try this! Yes, I meant all conversion on my PC, and then only the resulting mp3s and feed somewhere online (meaning no conversion if my PC is off, but whatever the latest converted file is will still be available.) But that was mainly because that sounded easier to figure out than installing and running everything on a server.
No clue, but it will be nice once it lands. I can see it being heavily abused in interesting ways. 
* Write a password generator and don't put it on github (everybody does) * Write a wallpaper swapper * Check r/learnpython * Check r/dailyprogrammer
Yeah that video was great! Good grounds to get all the vocab to do further research online.
No that's not me. I just got the sound effect cuz it would be hilarious with headphones
Might I just add that this doesn't work for all school computers, but it did get me and my friend admin. Idk how but it worked twice.
Thank you!
I think sometimes when people say you need to be good at math to do CS/programming they mean that you need to be good at logic. I'd say being able to think through a problem rationally is a pretty big part of programming. The answer to your question also heavily depends on what exactly you want to do. Programming is used in so many different industries and disciplines that there is no good one answer. - A web developer is going to need hardly any math at all - a game developer needs linear algebra, calculus, physics basics - a data analyst needs statistics and probability - ... In any case, just keep going. Not everyone will end up writing the next big encryption algorithm, code the most efficient game engine or do complex climate simulations. Nonetheless with the current state of computer illiteracy in the general population, being able to program is a very valuable skill. Awesome for you!
These are exactly the correct recommendations!
I have no idea of Android development but I ran a small script using Termux once. This will only work if you don't need a GUI and are able to install all libraries you used. You do have access to pip as usual but some stuff just fails to install because it uses libraries that aren't available for ARM. 
I have started writing a cron replacement in Python, I called it [yacron](https://github.com/gjcarneiro/yacron) (Yet Another Cron). The main problem I'm trying to solve is running cron jobs in Docker. Mainly because existing cron daemons, though they have options to run in the foreground, they don't show the output of the commands that cron runs in its own stdout. You have to write to a log file or send it as email. And even then, sending as email is when there is any command output, regardless on whether this output represents a failure or not. My replacement cron takes yaml as configuration file(s), and has options to control when a command is considered failed, and how to report the failure (email and sentry output supported so far). It is written in modern Python 3.5 with asyncio. Feedback most welcome.
I am not sure how to embed a python program into an android app, but you probably can put your program on a server and access it on your android app through web services / api.

This looks cool, thanks for sharing this. I have a question, maybe someone can help. I'm having a hard time installing the Excel Add-In for Excel 2016. Based off instructions here: http://docs.xlwings.org/en/stable/addin.html#xlwings-addin this should work, but when I use the 'xlwings addin install' command, I get returned 'Error: This command is only available on Windows right now.' Any thoughts/advice appreciated!

You would think so but ChainCoin has just shown that this is not true. A garden variety coin can get traction just by having a community rally behind it. As you suggest the usual way to do that is to have a great story about existing or forthcoming tech, but there are other ways. ZrCoin, for example, is not about crypto tech at all but instead about building a ZrO2 foundry. Interesting times.
It took me forever. I want to save the data from all the 10 tables given into a text file. After brainstorming for a while I decided to use panda - import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import pandas as pd url="http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/officesAndAdministration" r=requests.get(url) df = pd.read_html(r.content, attrs = {})[0] data = open("Data.txt", "w") print(df) But it only gives the data of one table and I want the data from all the 10 tables. I also need to save that data into a text file. Your help would be appreciated.
I will look into those. Thank you.
A stretch, but does the court system have an API for this?
Rewrite it using java/kotlin for android or pass images to a backend and do recognition there. 
Awesome, when is the ICO? I would like 20 please.
Thanks for the feedback. I will take a deeper look at it.
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython. We **highly encourage** you to re-submit your post over on there. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community is actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers.

Exactly. Math is a concept. I an an engineer and apply math daily. I have ADD and can't add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers together without making mistakes. I actually found calculus easiest because the numbers are more manageable. I've taken 10 higher level math classes including my masters and lots of engineering where we use that math in more complicated ways. As you get into things like signal processing and FEA/CFD, eventually you'll realize that all that math you did by hand is better bookkept by a computer. As that point, it's a black box function probably that's part of numpy/scipy/proprietary code and you shouldn't be looking at it. You need to know why to use it and how to interpret it. I rarely do anything more complicated than point slope and I always use the same best form. It's not the form you use in school, but it's a stock equation. y=(y2-y1)/(x2-x1)(x-x1)+y1

This might sound stupid but just to make sure, when you do: driver = webdriver.Chrome() You know it's creating a whole new browser session (cookies, cache, etc.) so the captcha system interprets it as a new user and requires validation. Make sure you're not starting a new driver for each request.

Excel, SQL, PowerShell are alternatives I usually turn towards depending on what I am doing. I am really only proficient in Excel and Python. I am still picking up the architectural concepts of deploying SQL environments. I found PowerShell/.bat is easier for working with multiple files so that is just about all I use it for. Then there is this huge .Net layer separating my work from the User input which I don't understand at all, that is obviously important for something.
Currently working my way through this - no complaints so far. I've been skipping through the first sections really quick as I don't need a python crash course, I already know how to use numpy etc ... can't comment on the later material yet.
You're probably better off web scraping than using selenium. You can pass in already logged in cookies this way. Or, even better, if they have an API you can use, that would be best. Selenium is useful for testing web sites with "real" clicks, but if you're just looking to get information, web scraping is way more efficient.
Explain?

I'm finishing my tracking algorithm that tracks moving particles given their positions overtime (without knowing which is which beforehand) using Voronoï Diagrams to know where to look at when searching for the next position of a particle. It already works fine when the particles don't move "too fast" but now I'm adding a feature that will keep tracking them even when the old version "lost" them. The time complexity of this is in O(T*N*log(N)) where N is the number of particles and T is the number of images (or timesteps). It's only useful to some physicists and isn't optimal at the moment but I'm still proud of what it can do!

Then you would have to name your two databases differently so giveme knows which one to inject where. I'm thinking that maybe some kind of namespacing or scoping could be a future feature, but at the moment you can just do something like this: @register def log_database(): return MyNoSQLDB(...) @register def database(): return MySQLDB(...) @inject def model_retriever(database=None): ... do stuff @inject def my_logger(log_database=None): ... do stuff You can of course name your dependencies whatever you want, but the name of the `@register`ed function must match the argument name in the injectee.

This is a really great overview course. I've been working as a data scientist in SF for around five years. I feel like I have a pretty comprehensive understanding of methods and the way I do things seems to work well for me. Udemy had a $10 sale, and I bought this course among a handful of others. My thinking was that I never had formal introductions to a lot of these packages... I just kinda started using them and figured out how to accomplish my tasks at the time. So, while there was the way that I do things, it may not be the most efficient way or the way others do things. I'm about halfway through this course, and even though I haven't learned a ton of new things, I feel like I have a more comprehensive view of a lot of things that I already knew a bit about. So, for me, it's been highly worth the $10, and has already changed how I do some of my work :)

if you're doing something like: def get_case(case_number): driver = webdriver.Chrome() driver.get('www.courtcases.not/case/{}'.format(case_number)) get_case(1) get_case(2) You're starting a new session for each case you get. You should be doing something like this. def get_case(driver, case_number): driver.get('www.courtcases.not/case/{}'.format(case_number)) driver = webdriver.Chrome() get_case(driver, 1) get_case(driver, 2)

I have a super small webservice translating other webservice from xml to JSON :)
&gt; A garden variety coin can get traction just by having a community rally behind it. And how much of that is people chasing the greater fool? Personally I'd be reluctant to throw my money into cryptocurrencies to begin with, and even more so if the currency didn't have some sort of fundamental advantage. 
OP, I think you might all enjoy this article: https://zengineeringpodcast.com/betting-on-the-blockchain-or-when-the-status-network-token-broke-ethereum-2d89d1e15163
I'm curious, why do you need async DI? What kind of things do you use it for?
ascii and utf8 aren't the only encodings out there, they just happen to be the defaults. &gt;&gt;&gt; s = 'thedoogster' # a string &gt;&gt;&gt; s.encode('rot13') # using str.encode 'gurqbbtfgre'
All of it. I completely agree with the concept of treating crypto like a tech investment, but I don't think that any crypto passes the threshold of being a true investment. Therefore I see crypto as a speculation game. Not only do you want to pick good tech, trustworthy leadership and so forth but you also have to try to outguess the crowd vis-a-vis valuation. I have done pretty well (with some help from my friends) but I am mostly out as of about a month ago. Things got too frothy for me.
I use it to do fast upload/download to/from Amazon S3 as part of a data pipeline. It's effective for that. Try pypy or uvloop, they're really fast.
This is very good course as i have been very good experience with it. Yes, it is $10 now so its great opportunity to enroll in this course for those who are looking for being data scientist :)

Look at network traffic. It most likely sends out a POST or a GET when you input the case number. Duplicate that request.
Not me but a friend uses it for monitoring as a service. The tool is actually open source, [called irisett](https://github.com/beebyte/irisett).
Ooohhhh GREEK!!! I thought it said geek... My first through was "CNN isn't a geek site"
Thats what i thought. I rater use a container like DI but i dont know if is the "python way" or not, since im coming from other languages. Anyway, good job, i usually go for the simple and objective things. Definitely will use. :)
Haha, why the fuck would you do that?
This sounds actually useful! Nice
I'm working on a django app for analytics in the fast moving consumer goods sector
I still only use gevent over asyncio for production, except when using an existing project already made with asyncio.
&gt; A garden variety coin can get traction just by having a community rally behind it Or by faking a few transactions and immediately getting a huge apparent market cap. Be careful people, the vast majority of these coins are gonna be scams.
Well there's [this](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/99_Bottles_of_Beer#The_bottled_version), although it didn't compile for me.
It sure did. We ended up using a glue language as a general purpose one and countless resources have been wasted.
Hi. I need help building a simple display that can print the readings from a Raspberry Pi into a dynamically updating window. PM if you can help with a sort of thing. Obviously will give you more details too. Thanks :)
Congratulations. I still think this is an awesome job and a very unexpected showcase what you can do with Tkinter. Well done sir.
Good question :)
Thanks man 
We are using AsyncIO for server code in production in Shardbound ( /r/shardbound ). We ported over from Twisted early on, and had a relatively easy time doing so. For the most part, we are really happy with it. Library support is coming along nicely as well, although we have run into situations where we've had to roll our own. I do miss the ability to easily suspend or timeslice a coroutine as I could with Stackless. Making sure an individual unit of work doesn't cause stalls is something we've needed to dedicate more time to than I'd like. Debugging (and by extension, diagnostic logging) is also made more difficult and has required us to jump through some hoops to track the initiating context for a task. Otherwise it's been pretty great. Simple, minimalist API helps keep the overhead of using it light, and we just add on complexity where we need it.
you are the hero that gotham deserves
&gt; If you want it to have any traction you will have to convince people that your cryptocurrency offers something that other, more well-established, currencies do not. Things that everyone tries to make their own version of (and they really *shouldn't* unless they're doing it for fun or *really* know what they're doing). * Cryptocurrency * Operating systems * Cryptography code Any others?

Please add my testimonial: "very accurate testimonials".
Discord bot that's essentially a glorified plugin loader and nothing else, so all functionality can be added externally. Currently giving it a webUI with flask.
I do work remote, I never had to show them any code since my job is more maintaining tables with configuration values as opposed to deploying scripts with complex logic. Two projects I talked about that probably made me stand out. First, deploying tracking code for a site redesign of one the most popular recipe sites in the US &amp; Canada. My second project was a proof of concept for combining marketing data from multiple channels to get a holistic and deterministic view of a customers advertising exposure. It also didn't hurt having a recommendation from the project leader. I wouldn't even call myself a developer yet, but for the first time I am working 80% with developers and 20% with business instead of the other way around. edit: My personal project to learn python was creating databases to track financial transactions and asset values. It started as a budget in excel but when I was tired of manually entering transactions I pivoted to scraping the info from the web and populating databases.
and the most popular backend language on the web is a glorified HTML templating library. And the fastest-growth language in the world is a sickly mutant relative of LISP that wears the flayed skin of Java as a mask. and the most prevalent systems language in the world is 45 years old and horrifyingly unsafe (undefined behavior, buffer over/underflows, a type system that slows you down but doesn't particularly catch any meaningful bugs). You know what I think matters more than the language? the culture and community of the ecosystem. Python's culture and community is outstanding. 
90% of everything is garbage.
pls add my testimonial: no memes guaranteed.
You can normally abandon side projects if you lose interest. 
If that wasn't posted by a bot, it would be truly cruel.
This module is simply amazing. We've had a continuous problem with people trying to write JavaScript code in Python, and this module has helped alleviate much of the pain (in addition to `from __future__ import braces`). We have deployed this to all our 72 microservices in our production Docker containers. In addition, we have started using the `json_sempai` module to aid in parsing our log files. Thank you so much!!
This is simply disgusting. *Upvotes*
I knew perl wasn't the most popular language these days, but wow
It's like there's no connection between popularity and technical merit and we're supposed to celebrate that instead of asking for improvements.

I haven't had any experiences with servers, and setting up an IRC would let me send data across multiple networks like a server client chat would on a local network, the problem I had with just using something like freenode is the flood count kept getting in the way
I'm not sure, but I think the difference for you is between talking about "visiting ipython on the web" vs "visiting ipython in a shell". To see it on the web, you have to serve the page, i.e. `notebook server`. Note that any webpage is in the end served. To display it in an editor or terminal, `ipython` as a command is running in an interactive shell. The webserver does more than only provide a webpage to edit cells in, but I guess in terms of "just writing some python code in a bunch of cells", it might seem inconvenient to you. Idea: have `notebook server` run as a service, i.e. on startup? This is certainly no official statement, not even sure if it answers your question exactly.
No, it's just that clearly 'technical merit' is a nebulous term and is only capturing a small part of the picture. People choose languages for reasons other than saving a cycle or two and to pretend that their all not using &lt;language that I like&gt; because they are too stupid is just profoundly ignorant.
It's a deliberate design choice to separate the user interface from the back-end that does the actual calculation. For example in scientific computing you often want the computation to be done on a very large and powerful cluster, but there's no need to be actually sitting at that machine, which you might not even have physical access to. It also allows for enormous flexibility, for example multiple back-ends can be swapped out while sharing the same user interface. This allows for using many different languages in a notebook, making it even more powerful. Since this architecture runs all throughout the notebook interface, I doubt anyone wants to have to undertake the enormous effort that would be required to bypass the client/server model for the special case of local access. It would just lead to more bugs. Using a notebook locally is not a special case. 
Have you never commited to a repo or looked at changes in a branch? There will be lines with + or - to indicate what was added or removed. As far as testing, thats really up to you. However, you want to test in the same manner production is used. So if prod uses from pkg import module Then you need to do the same effective thing in your code. IE do not do from dev.pkg import new.module in your tests. You can see the commit messages for other repos, but general these are short and concise; "Fixed CVE-123".
When you're testing the changes, test them using the normal methods given for running the project normally. That's usually a safe way of doing so. Then write some unit tests to keep things in check. Once you're ready, yes, make a pull request. Yes, the maintainers will have a chance to review and comment on every single change. The message should be a short, one line description of what you've changed in your PR.
Those sizes though...
Fuck yeah, I love pseudocode. I learned Python from resources that emphasized pseudocode and it's still one of my early steps for a major script is to pseudo it out in comments, and those code comments become the skeleton on which the real code bones are laid, and they help document it when I come back to the code.
Define 'technical merit.'
I have hacking the xbox too, never read it thouhg lol
&gt; and the most popular backend language on the web is a glorified HTML templating library Not that I disagree, but that is kind of exactly what I want from a programming language specifically for generating html, if it just had breaking versions for the sake of getting rid of the backwards compatability language clutter, I'd definitely use it more.
What a fascinating psychological experiment: bandaid the problem and get things done, or insist on correctness and keep stumbling?
I triggered this by hitting 'e' and 'r' on the Game Over screen Traceback (most recent call last): File "tkinter\__init__.py", line 1533, in __call__ File "tkinter\__init__.py", line 582, in callit File "Code 3.8 Menu System.py", line 1459, in update File "Code 3.8 Menu System.py", line 1609, in newLevel File "Code 3.8 Menu System.py", line 1811, in readLevel IndexError: list index out of range Exception in Tkinter callback Traceback (most recent call last): File "tkinter\__init__.py", line 1533, in __call__ File "Code 3.8 Menu System.py", line 1928, in keyR File "Code 3.8 Menu System.py", line 1609, in newLevel File "Code 3.8 Menu System.py", line 1811, in readLevel IndexError: list index out of range
Yes. A mutable object like a list can be modified even if it's not returned. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
I added an example in the post. From what you're saying, it *will* print as [3, 6, 9] later?
anyway thanx for your help 
This is a great start, now plz extend to support syntax for all other statements from other languages too.
No, because that code does not modify the list. It modifies the integers in the list, and since integers are immutable, the changes will lost when the function ends. Here is a function that modifies the list using append: &gt;&gt;&gt; def func(lst): ... lst.append(4) ... &gt;&gt;&gt; lst = [1,2,3] &gt;&gt;&gt; func(lst) &gt;&gt;&gt; lst [1, 2, 3, 4] 
&gt; Define 'technical merit.' Efficiently using resources like CPU and RAM. Preventing a large number of errors with strong static typing and verified type systems. Allowing compilation to assembly. Having a complete specification that allows competing implementations that are 100% compatible between them. And so on, and so forth...
&gt; to pretend that their all not using &lt;language that I like&gt; because they are too stupid is just profoundly ignorant Unlike pretending that technical merit doesn't matter?
I think this is more of a structural problem than the fault of the person doing the automation. It clearly makes sense to make something that took 45 minutes of error-prone work take 15. We just don't have a strong system in place to support people who lose their jobs this way, so the automator now has to bear the guilt of potentially ruining someone's life by spending a few days automating their job. It's a shitty situation that needs to be addressed at the government level.
I sometimes try to pseudocode and then it turns out I just wrote Python.
Don't do that thanks
If it had a design process better than "bolt another one on, Frank!" it might not need breaking versions to fix problems :|
hahahaha best response to a bug report ever
&gt; And so on, and so forth... Kind of reinforces the point he's trying to make.
Your definition completely ignores one of the more expensive resources involved in software development: developer time It also ignores business needs, which are kinda the reason there is software development at all, and how fast they can change. You can say those things are not "technical", but you will keep creating languages no one uses.
I was in the room for this one and while it was really awesome, I wish he would have spent less of his time writing the code and more showing it off.
Seconded.
Build python from source, because you are able to get every new version. I do this for my user with a path-prefix of **~/opt** sudo aptitude install tk-dev sudo aptitude install libbz2-dev sudo aptitude install libgdbm-dev sudo aptitude install ncurses-dev sudo aptitude install liblzma-dev sudo aptitude install libsqlite3-dev sudo aptitude install libssl-dev sudo aptitude install libreadline6-dev wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.2/Python-3.6.2.tgz tar xvzf Python-3.6.2.tgz cd Python-3.6.2 ./configure --prefix=$HOME/opt
Where’s my print*,”string” and write (*,*) outputs ?
This is useful - thank you. We rapidly histogram images to assess process conditions - this may increase cycle time for some of our scripts. Thank ya much!
You're bashing python on /r/python. git out
&gt; You're bashing python on /r/python. We do these things not because they are easy, but because they are hard. ;-)
&gt; If it had a design process better than "bolt another one on, Frank!" it might not need breaking versions to fix problems :| Unlike Python?
You missed step 0. Step 0 is decide what you want to do. Discuss what you will do with the project authors, so when you get to step 6 and submit a pull request, so you don't get outright rejected. I once got a pull request where someone reorganized the entire project, didn't pass any of the tests, and was 1 year out of date. Thankfully, he didn't pull the latest version of the project before pulling (he was a year out of date), so the merge failed and I couldn't click accept even if I wanted to. I wouldn't have accepted anyways. &gt; What should the message say? Why the feature is useful and what you did. &gt; Will whoever approves the pull request be able to see the exact changes or do I need to add this in the commit message. Yes, but they maybe won't see the big picture. You should talk about how you implemented the feature and reasons for your changes. Depending on the project, you may have to change stuff, but most smaller projects will just click accept, even if they don't like the change, because they want developers.
Or unlike ruby
What's wrong with the sizes?
Yhat rodeo
Oh so sorry! I didn't know, won't happen again thanks for the help though!
The company I work for is creating this huge impressive webapp that allows school and companies to provide their students / employees with an easy digital curriculum. Its due to be finished somewhere in early 2018. The program is written almost exclusively in python2. 
For me the top two sizes were 2XL and 3XL. It probably doesn't actually mean anything, but you know...
I feel like the PEP process is one of the best ways of managing how the language evolves, but I was actually referring to PHP's syntax and grammar.

If there's a setup.py, pip installing works well. You can actually pip install with the `--editable` flag so that you don't have to edit your sys.path or run things from certain directories.
An IPython notebook is transformed into an html page; so you need to use a browser to view it. On your computer, a browser can display static files, using the file:// protocol; this is not what an IPython notebook is. To communicate with some other process (like the IPython interpreter) so that the content of the page can be updated, a web server must be running.

Technical merit matters, but no one speaks Esperanto and there are some really good reasons for that. 
Why not base it on type hints rather than binding things to names?

As far as I understand, because you used: for i in lst: i *= 3 the item i is being taken from the list, and then multiplied by 3, rather than multiplying it in-place. If you did something like this: for j in range(len(lst)): lst[j] *= 3 or for j, i in enumerate(lst): lst[j] = i*3 then the object lst **would** be modified when this function is run.

Had to do something like this recently where I had to pare down 50k records to about 500 and add 2 or three pieces of information per record to those 500, based on a field. In the end I just went with straight up regex. I pattern matched them, starting broad and narrowing down (luckily the data was sort of funnel shaped). Not sure if it fits your use case, but could work if the things your matching on are sort of pattern related.

You don't have to wait for asyncio to use async code in prod. Twisted has been around for ages and provides async support even in python 2.

Speaking from experience - it's harder than you think to sort clothing sizes. Data from distributers is dirty.
&gt; Making sure an individual unit of work doesn't cause stalls is something we've needed to dedicate more time to than I'd like. &gt; &gt; Debugging (and by extension, diagnostic logging) is also made more difficult and has required us to jump through some hoops to track the initiating context for a task. These are the reasons I never put it into production. Before giving up on it, I did a fair amount of monkey patching to try workaround the issues but never got it to the point were it didn't feel like swimming upstream constantly before the weight of the monkey patching started to seem like to much cost for too little gain.

Probably since type hints are unpythonic? *holywar starts here* I'm really think, that if you need type hints, then you need to choose another language.
I once built an adapter framework to consume that type of data and… holy crap, that is such an understatement.
Which commodities are more precious: 1. CPU &amp; RAM 1. Developer time &amp; avoiding bugs
I used to feel the same way, but after using them, I like them. I like them even more after properly configuring my editor to make use of them. I'm not really sure you can argue that they're not Pythonic when they were championed by Guido. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ The best part about typehints in Python is that they're optional, meaning if you don't want to use them, you don't have to. Those of us that want to use them are free to without impeding your use of the library (unless you're stuck on 2, but you have bigger issues imo)
This solution is a bit rough and you will probably want to cleanup the output. Also might want to add some error checking. Though it does the essentials of what you are asking using BeautifulSoup and requests. def main(): r = requests.get('http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/officesAndAdministration') soup = BeautifulSoup(r.text, 'html.parser') tables = soup.find_all('tbody') data = [parse_table(t) for t in tables] printer(data) def parse_table(t): rows = t.find_all('tr')[1:] return [parse_columns(r.find_all('td')) for r in rows] def parse_columns(row): return [c.get_text().strip() for c in row] def printer(data): with open('output.txt', 'w') as f: for table in data: for row in table: for column in row: f.write(column) f.write('\n-----------------\n')

I did a subject at university studying knowledge tasks, where a global edit distance algorithm such as levenshtein distance was effective at matching incorrectly spelled words to intended words. However it can take a long time if your data set of words is large. There are also other ways to compare words such as soundex to compare them phonetically or more simple methods such as n-gram (comparing based on grouping letters) which is quick but not as accurate. A combination of these methods is effective to break ties.
Assuming you mean doing something like this: from somewhere import SqlThing @inject def do_stuff(database_thing: SqlThing): ... Instead of this: @inject def do_stuff(database_thing=None): ... Why? Now `do_stuff` depends on a specific implementation of a database thing instead of an interface. I wouldn't use a library that promises decoupling if the first example shows me how to add more coupling. Maybe I want to swap out sql for redis or use sql in production and some `MockDbThing` for testing, the typehint dependency forces me to give all the database things a common parent class even if they literally have nothing in common except method signatures. I also can't unambiguously inject two SqlThings with different configurations into the same method or inject a dict if I also have another argument typehinted with `dict`. 
Don't type hint with concrete types then. Why does SQLThing need to be the type you hint with? Why not an interface - ThingRepository or some such. As for unambiguously injecting two of the same thing, how often do you find yourself doing that? Even if you do, you could use generics to handle that situation - though that seems like an abuse of them

&gt; Debugging (and by extension, diagnostic logging) is also made more difficult and has required us to jump through some hoops to track the initiating context for a task.

I do scraping things. but my job covers crawling apps etc.
You have a typo. Python, according to the link provided, is top for Web and enterprise, not mobile. 
Interesting, for some reason I had a Prolog course in my 2nd year of uni while it is rank 32. Ofcourse ranking doesn't say everything, but you'd assume you'd get to learn a more broadly used programming language in uni.
&gt; In particular, Python is the No. 1 for Web, Mobile and Enterprise categories but is not present in the top 14 positions in the Embedded category despite the constant growth of solutions such as Zerynth and Micropython. Can mobile app development be done in Python?
Thank you, edited
My typo, sorry. In this ranking, Python is top for Web and Enterprise, not mobile.
[removed]
Well, yes. It was meant to be rhetorical.
&gt;You know what I think matters more than the language? the culture and community of the ecosystem. This opinion makes sense if you only think of programming as a hobby. But for those of us who work in the industry, Python/PHP/JavaScript doesn't cut it when it comes to delivering quality software quickly. Billions of dollars have been spent fixing mistakes that better languages could have prevented. Because programming is a profession, programming languages are judged by how easily and consistently they allow a professional to produce high quality work. Community and culture isn't a factor here. 
Which writer do you mean bro? Can you give any name?
so what you need is a GUI ? I can help with that.
"batteries included" mentality. not sure i agree either. an interface to use whatever delivery you want would probably be better (upload somewhere, just write to disk/s3, send email/sms with path/"ready" info only, trigger some webhook, etc).
Uni is about teaching concepts. You can learn concepts in Python, Prolog or LOLCODE. 
Python doesn't run close enough to the metal to be useful in a lot of embedded environments. It's never going to be a top 5 language for embedded.

Try running the same thing using Python3 and see what happens. Also, try printing all those variables one at a time so you can get the correct line that's having the issue.
Keep in mind that this list only contains 48 popular programming languages, while [many more exist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages). So any language on the IEEE list is probably relatively broadly-used. Also, I would actually think that university is a more likely place to encounter domain-specific or esoteric languages than many other places.
I've only used Python 2.7, and I'm somewhat concerned the rest of my code will break if I go to 3.x. I print them and get a bunch of what appear to be either binary or unicode characters which is why I went down that path. It looks like this: linuxadmin@vlanapp:/var/prtg/scripts$ sudo python snmp-test.py ÃŒÃ¯HÂÂŒj "Â½O "ÂÂ‘2v "Â½Ã° Ã„}O Â’ Ã„}O Â‹ Ã„}O Ã Ã„}O Ã— Ã„}O F Ã„}O Ã˜ "Â½Ãœ' "Â½ÃœÂ‚ Ã„}O "Â½d "Â½Ã„ "Â½t If I use square brackets around the value in the print statement, I get this: linuxadmin@vlanapp:/var/prtg/scripts$ sudo python snmp-test.py [u'\xcc\xefH\x8f\x8cj'] [u'\x00"\xbd\x1a\x0fO'] [u'\x00"\x90\x912v'] [u'\x00"\xbd\x1bNf'] [u'\x00"\xbd\x1bM\xf0'] [u'\xc4}O\x0f\t\x92'] [u'\xc4}O\x0f\t\x8b'] [u'\xc4}O\x0f\t\xe0'] [u'\xc4}O\x0f\t\xd7'] Which is unicode. But every attempt I make to decode/encode results in errors.
It probably shouldn't try to be as that would lead to other drawbacks

My friend and I always do last-word battles, which is pretty much what you think it is. The person who has the last word wins, and since we both want to win this can lead to endless conversations. A few months ago I programmed something quickly: a skype bot that sends the same message every minute, so I can sleep while he needs to respond. However, he found it unfair since it was clearly a bot. That's why I started the following project: since my bot needed to have actual conversations, [cleverbot](https://www.cleverbot.com/) came to mind. Thanks to its API and skpy I could quickly link it with skype. And believe me, the results are hilarious. My friend talked to it for about 5 minutes before noticing something was off... he then realized and started to have fun. When I got home I started reading through the logs, and it turns out he talked to it for *two full hours!*. And boy, some of the messages are hilarious. [example](http://i.imgur.com/HZ63f6d.jpg)

Can I read this on computer? Or I must buy it?
The embedded field is large. Python can take its place there introducing users to embedded projects - The Raspberry Pi for example. If you are building a small number of product then Python and the larger resources to run it might weigh positively against possibly longer development times and the need for more specialist developers. Not everything embedded needs to be the fastest and less memory hungry - some machines embed PC's running Windows !
Yes, but why not learn concepts in a language that you can also use productively after graduation?
Try to learn logic programming in Python. Have fun. It's simply the wrong language for that. Also, you *can* use every language productively. The most important reasons why exotic languages don't gain much traction are simply legacy and developers being unfamiliar with them.
&gt; embedded environments Quoting from Wikipedia: &gt; An embedded system is a computer system with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system, often with real-time computing constraints. If you ignore real-time constraints, a Raspberry Pi could qualify as an embedded system and that one has enough horse power to run Python.

&gt; avoiding bugs With a dynamically typed and interpreted language with significant indentation? Good luck with that...
'''Pseudocode''' or #Pseudocode would be the only improvement needed. For future releases maybe...
I strongly disagree. The three examples I gave are all languages with tremendous use in industry and I have used them professionally myself for many years. Every technology has warts, and some are very warty. Programmers in industry are able to provide enormous value even with flawed technology. I believe that strong communities of practice enable the software development process much more powerfully than a language that matches some particular notion of technical merit. 
Just switched to Python this year. Not surprising. Glad I did too. Keeping that resume valid.
I hate the confusion between DI and the cool use of a Service Locator. Holywood principle (don't call me I call you) is not a bad movie with code coupled to some Service Locator. You need a service locator to create a dependency injector, but its not the same thing. I like [depency_injector package](http://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org) as base to a DI. With a dynamic container you can configure your service locator in a declarative way. Then a piece of your code can inject depencies to be used without decorators. It easier to unit test your code if no service locator need to be configured or mocked. Excuse my poor english.
As stated in the readme, the code is using GitHub API, so no offline rendering. There is more than that - see comments to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13781363) answer on SO. (and you can find other options for rendering markdown there)

I think you'll appreciate this: [Python for ESP8266 in just a few clicks using Zerynth](https://www.zerynth.com/blog/python-for-esp8266-in-just-a-few-clicks-using-zerynth/)

Have you heard of C? Embedded engineers know C. It runs on basically everything and it's faster than Usain Bolt on Red Bull. 
&gt; that wears the flayed skin of Java as a mask. I giggled.
This is good and bad side, since this splits community. Not too much, but polar opinions will make situation, when someone love python for duck-typing and will not contribute to project with heavy type hints, cause open source contributions need strong motivation and almost any detail can revert potential contributor. Maybe I'm too paranoic, of course.
The course I attended in Uni was more about Formal Logic and the theory of logic programming. So we learned about propositional, predicate, temporal logic and things like SLD resolution and Unification. We just looked at Prolog as one practical implementation of that. And Prolog actually has some deficiencies.. it uses depth-first SLD tree generation for efficiency reasons which can result in non-terminating programs even though they would terminate breadth-first. But besides that look at logic programming and some experiments, I haven't used it again. I see no applications for it besides expert systems and maybe some other AI stuff. 
&gt; He means you have no business here. this is the kind of inclusiveness I've come to love about the python community as it is represented on /r/python 
At my alma mater, they use C++ for logic programming. Teachers don't have to use purely academic languages to teach higher level concepts. I'd go so far as to say that teaching someone elementary programming in an near-esoteric/academic programming language would be counter-productive.
I'm a user for a long time, I can recommend :-)
I use Python because our main software vendor (Esri) built some really really nice tools for it, and it's got some good stuffi n the standard library. Good enough for me, even if it doesn't make purists' socks roll up and down.
&gt; It runs on basically anything True. &gt; it's faster than Usain Bolt on Red Bull. Only if you know what you're doing. Naively written C code isn't magically fast. Besides that, it's more important to improve the algorithms before you do micro-optimizations. EDIT: Removed nonsense.
As a regular Fortran user, I second this. In which case `write` be able to handle formatted and unformatted output.

I've been part of and seen companies that do this the right way, by finding other work for their employees to do, rather than just letting them go. If the company is able to free up work for a bunch of engineers and aren't finding new products and services for them to create, the company doesn't have a long term vision for their industry
Currently working through sentdex's matplotlib and finance tutorials, trying to learn about interacting with data more. Also trying to find open source projects to contribute something to although this has been tough as I'm still a beginner.
Sure, but embedded systems engineers (who are the people who influence lists like this), know how to write C. Most embedded stuff doesn't involve complicated algorithms and where it does, you prototype in something else (often python), then rewrite in optimised C/C++. The people doing the prototyping aren't always the same people that write the C/C++. For micropython to get serious traction, it will have to be at least as fast as well optimised C. I haven't seen any benchmark that suggests they are close to that.
Well done. I've ported just about everything we use in our team, and it's been pretty painless across all repos. Tests always help confidence, and making ansible playbooks to deploy everything while I go has made things easier for everyone. I get the feeling after doing all this that if py2 programmers would add a couple of "from _ _future_ _ import ..." to the top of their code the effort to port would be close to zero for the majority of things. The stuff that's been genuinely difficult is porting common libraries, as they needed to support both Py2 and Py3 at the same time. Fundamentally because they're a moving target you're better off trying to keep it as a single target that works with both, rather than keeping two branches in sync. The worst of that of course were the oldest ones that had no or few tests, and used division and old style classes. If I had an old app that had no tests, was working fine but needed very little future maintenance, and was pretty gnarly code, well I'd probably just keep that on Python2 to the end of time, virtualised in some way, packaged up in a container or some such, and end-of-support be damned. Rather like hearing of tiny TV stations that still use a VideoToaster on an Amiga. We all know it'll catch on fire at some point, and be expensive and difficult to replace.
odd, seems like there are a lot more javascript jobs out there though.

Did you click the link? ***Additionally, the book is on Amazon.***
Try hipster return gay?
Yes I clicked 
So you should see all the chapters in the book, digitally. In short, the book is online.
On the other hand, micropython runs fast enough on boards like the Wemos D1, if you want to control a few switches, do some http/https web requests or make LED flicker. Micropython should easily make it into the top 5 for embedded within the next 5 years, just because everyone with Python knowledge can suddenly program an embedded device. (Disclosure: I own a Wemos Mini and am amazed, how easy it is to program that. With no need to learn C or Assembler.) 
Means that I've to get it from Internet.
I clone interfaces without inheritance all the time, sometimes there's virtually no code shared between implementations. Python gives you a choice. I use typehints sometimes and only so that my linter knows what I'm talking about, but ultimately the function I'm passing the thing into doesn't care as long as it has this and that method. Have you ever worked with two files inside a function? Should you have to subclass FileIO just so you can inject them both? Mainly, I don't want your choice of using giveme to influence your whole architecture, it's just a tool with one job: "take the output of this callable and stick it into that callable". Enforcing static type safety is a job for another tool. I still want you to be able to inject your 12 instances of uniquely monkey patched dict objects if you so choose. 
No.... You can order the book also on amazon. See above post.
I think you need this: class OneLineExceptionFormatter(logging.Formatter): def format(self, record): s = super(OneLineExceptionFormatter, self).format(record) if record.exc_text: fl = s.find('\n') return s[:fl] return s Use this in place of your normal console formatter. You will get the log entry for logging.exception("No cheese in the shop."), but the backtrace will not show up.
Any statistic built on github examples isn't useful for determining popularity. Perhaps to say what people are experimenting with but realistically Javascript should be #1 for web since it's used by everyone no matter which backend. To me this suggests that it's not a very good measurement of which languages are being used professionally or even the most.
&gt; Can mobile app development be done in Python? kinda. i've looked into it from time to time. it doesn't seem to be a native thing, but you can do some work with it. 
&gt; Perhaps if you measure speed in terms of finishing time (you won't tire as fast?) but not in terms of km/h. in most longer races, Bolt's splits are so close to even that the only way to lower his time would be to improve his overall speed. you have to get up to the longest distances he'll run before his endurance even begins to hint at flagging. 
with this, can I just display values normally read into the terminal?
The methodology must be highly flawed, because if I click "web", R shows up at #6 and JavaScript is #7. That makes essentially no sense. Even if you REMOVED web, JavaScript would still be more popular than R! (I say this as an R and Python user.) 
https://kivy.org/#home I made a small test application in python for android. Should work for everything else at the same time according to the devs. Never really tested it.
Memory resources to support micropython or any interpreted language are at least an order of magnitude greater than the corresponding 'c' code. All those extra transistors burn energy/batteries, making it a poor choice for any application where energy usage is paramount.
I don't think micro python will be more used than C / C++ / assembler (maybe) / VHDL (maybe) / Verilog. I have tried it briefly and it's nice, could maybe a top#10 embedded language (whatever that means). Micro python will probably not have a chance to be top 5 if the measurement is in number of produced/sold products.

Why are you injecting file streams with a DI framework? I won't say you shouldn't, just I can't think of a reason to. My reasoning for preferring type hint injections is: * name based injections bind me to magic strings I can't jump to with something like ctags * name based injections don't offer code completion like type hints would As for working with two file streams in a method, I prefer constructor injection and then really only at the boundaries of domain and application (e.g. where my logic and ui meet), so I would simply pass the two file streams as arguments at the invocation point. 
Without getting into the ipaddress module details, I just wanted to point out that your exclusion criteria are wrong. RFC1918 "private" address space consists of: * 192.168.x.x * 172.16-31.x.x * 10.x.x.x You are both excluding IPs like 172.12.x.x which are non-private, and failing to exclude others, both within the 172 prefix and the very popular 192.168.x.x space. 
well, yes, it's a VERY VERY basic GUI, and it'll totally look like IDLE. Since I don't know much else about what you want to do, I can't really help you more than that.
F# don't even make the list?
CS lecturer doesn't understand zero based arrays... What?
But embedded engineers don't know python. They know C. Why would they learn another language which is slower and only works on some hardware? The top 5 on embedded on this list is a little misleading. The reality of the top 5 is C; C++; Arduino; Assembly and in 5th place - people doing weird shit with hardware. So you might be right, it might scrape into the top 5, but only because there are only really 4 popular embedded language, so 5th is best of the rest. 
I've seen job postings where "embedded" meant a headless server. Python is perfectly fine for embedded, depending on the definition.
Use regex.
Then those people don't know what embedded systems are. I think the IEEE is probably using a reasonable definition. 
Might be a MatLab or other mathematical programming class. Those start at 1.
I use this on OS X and it does the job very nicely: https://macdown.uranusjr.com/ It has the added benefit of rendering in realtime as you edit. 
You're one hundred percent correct, thanks!
Care to elaborate? I've never worked with Regex, I'll google it now though. Thanks!
They have C listed for web too. Strange.
 def addr(s): return reduce(lambda acc, x: acc*256 + int(x), s.split('.'), 0) private = [ (addr('10.0.0.0'), addr('255.0.0.0')), (addr('172.16.0.0'), addr('255.240.0.0')), (addr('192.168.0.0'), addr('255.255.0.0')), ] def not_private(s): a = addr(s) return not reduce(lambda acc, x: True if acc else (a &amp; x[1]) == x[0], private, False) 
I've been seeing it a lot and in many postings. I agree it's stupid, but it's common usage and it's going to be how a lot of python users report themselves. 
True, and those super fast bots are very popular :-) https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/26/ddos-attack-dyn-mirai-botnet
&gt; C. It runs on basically everything and it's faster than Usain Bolt on Red Bull. I think I love that quote. C it's faster than Usain Bold on Red Bull.
While this is fairly do-able for IPv4, it's a little messy for the 172.16-31.x.x range, and it's not programming in the problem domain. While it does have the advantage of not requiring external modules, I'd alternately recommend the netaddr package, which includes .is_private() as a method that works for both IPv4 and v6 address space.
Also thought I would add that the IEEE has C for the top embedded programming language and currently C and Python are tied for first place.
Forth ranks above ActionScript. Hahahaha.
It says "click to hide" not "show only for".
&gt; Only if you know what you're doing. Naively written C code isn't magically fast. That applies to every language. Properly written C is faster than properly written {language}.
Math. Not even once.

I'm an embedded hardware engineer; I use Python all the time, just not on microcontrollers. It's fairly common on embedded Linux systems.
Right but it's a circular argument to say "embedded engineers know C, therefore they won't use python, therefore python will never be used in embedded settings". I don't disagree with it, necessarily, but it is a bit circular.
Just because a situation is the way it is now, that doesn't mean that it will always be that way. (Arduino's not even 15 years old and I don't think you'll have to go much further back to get in situations where "c (much less c++) on embedded would have been an absurd idea)
Regex stands for "regular expression". You are describing the text youre looking for [0-9]{1..3}\\. This will find an IP octet, and the following dot. [0-9] finds a number in this range {1..3} find 1-3 instances of the preceding expression (numbers 0 through 9) in a row. \\. A dot is regex for "any single character". The \ escapes the dot, telling the regex engine to look for a literal dot. Regex can get pretty complex, but its a valuable tool in the NIX world. There are probably more pythonic ways to handle this particular issue, but regex is a good tool to become familiar with.
For sure, there are probably better ways of handling this. But since it can be solved with regex, and OP doesnt know any, this is a good exercise.
Same reason you would inject anything, socket, database connection, abstractions there of, whatever. If the file comes in through the UI, yeah then you're probably better off just passing it on. But getting the file can easily depend on some external logic that doesn't really belong between API and whatever thing processes the file. DI gets more useful when you have several IO streams to worry about. Point is, that without a DI framework you can write a function/method/constructor that accepts two DatabaseThings, and you may or may not have a valid reason to do so. If you introduce a DI framework, you would expect to be able to configure it to inject one or both them, right? What you propose makes that impossible, which I see as a huge limitation and a source of confusion (just imagine explaining that in a documentation) Note, you can still use typehints, the injector ignores them, but you still get all the IDE benefits. 
It's very cool to see such a comprehensive post :)
Thanks! I love parsing and I wanted to give an overview to people new to the field
- Car: Deploy the airbags! - Airbags: Lol, GIL. 
Embedded is a pretty broad category these days. I run Python on an Embedded Linux platform every day. It interfaces to SPI, eMMC, I2C, GPIOs, UARTs and PCIe perfectly fine with decent Linux drivers. I had to write a few C language extensions to work with vendor supplied code and i2c devices that pysmb couldn't talk to but other than that it was fine. If you don't consider processors with MMUs as embedded then yeah, you should probably stick with C.
AFAIK MicroPython doesn't have a GIL.
&gt; for Awesome, I'm looking now. Thanks! 
A lot of it is less about Python and more about scaling in general. You need a lot of raw computing power, replicated databases, multiple frontend proxies, caching, etc, etc.
Thanks for reply. Do performance depends on use of any frameworks or not?
Depends on what you mean by "performance". Ideally you want the actual Python part to be doing as little work as possible.
I thought you were a professional shipping quality code and drinking piña colada while us peons deal with Python-induced bugs, instead you're trolling on a Wednesday. Sad!
http://automatetheboringstuff.com/
By "performance" I mean speed. I just noticed that sites like Facebook/Youtube doesn't use any frameworks. So I thought frameworks have some limits or something. 
Speed of what exactly? Page loads?
"Be tolerant of my intolerance!"
Uhm to answer that joke; you do know that your comment is contradictory ? If the distance remains the same but the time decreases that implies that the speed increased too... It ruffles my feathers when see stuff like that (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻) Whether the acceleration curve due to caffeine or or average sustained max speed were the reason is another question.
Are you sure you got the code to compile? This doesn't look like it will since there are unresolved references in it. Like the variable "i" is used even though you never initiallized it. 
&lt;humor&gt;But how it would read a doctor's note?&lt;/humor&gt;
How are you doing it manually? If you are using ssh then you can use the `paramiko` module to automate it. 
Documentation?
If you're running python 3.x you may find the ipaddress module helpful: from ipaddress import ip_address non_private=[] for addr in address_list: a = ip_address(addr) if not a.is_private: non_private.append(a) Not the lightest solution, but it's reliable and simple to implement. And the IPv4Address and IPv6Address types have lots of other features that you may find useful. Also, if you'd prefer to parse the strings by hand as in your example, make sure to use str.startswith instead of str.contains. **"8.0.10.1".contains("10.1")** will return true, but 8.0.10.1 is definitely not a private address. Edit: I just reread your question and realized you're already aware of the ipaddress module. I would highly recommend taking the time to get comfortable with it, especially if you plan to do more network-related programming in the future
No, but C compilers have gotten fucking good at optimisation. You pretty much *can't* optimise python code (easily), because you can't make any assumptions about types for the most part. 
That does look like something that could help, I will try it. Thank you!
Awesome! I was waiting for a library like this to show up.
Exactly. How the hell is R even on this list? I'm sure there are a ton of R scripts on Github, but it's a scripting language and I have yet to see a real end to end product being built using R besides Rstudio.
Count of maximum handled requests per second, speed of data extraction from database.
None of those things really depend on the framework.
On what depend these things?
On your database, the way your SQL queries are written, and how caching/proxying is configured.
&gt; Usage &gt;Double-click the desired python script. The scripts will ask for the right input. It's right there on the page, pay attention! /s
Have similar bot, only made with node js. Not as fun as I thought it would be.
Hi ! Did you consider AWS S3 + AWS Lambda ? With boto3 you can send a file in a S3 bucket trigger a lambda function. Then the lambda function can send you the new file or store it in S3. Camille
Be careful with using mathematical models to generate tweets from tweets. Your bot will become like the users it is emulating. Microsoft did that and it got mean and *ist real quick.
That's kind of the point tho. I'm not affiliated with any company so I don't really care if it becomes a little racist. Plus, the tweets hardly ever make sense anyways.
Wow, what a fail. Embarassing. ._. Well.. I slept 4 hours, that's my excuse now.
&gt; Properly written C is faster than properly written {language}. I think the C++ fanboys like to disagree with that.
hmm, this must be a part of my old code, I didn't show most of it here It probably got hidden in the formatting when I was posting it, but rest assured, I remember that I had declared it and it ran properly without any issue, but when I was running the list_2's append or pop operation, it gave me errors
Could you try posting the entire class onto pastebin? Its hard to follow along with this. 
here you go! Please give me some credit if someone uses it! :P
Are Airbags deployed by microcontrollers ? That's frightening.
Selecting a fit doesn't filter the size drop down.
So it's good enough for toy projects. In the serious embedded world, you're trying to squeeze out every last byte, because it lets you use a $0.05 cheaper microcontroller, since that much adds up when you're moving millions of units.
These aren't your Arduinos. It's why those of us in that industry follow stuff like this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_Safety_Integrity_Level https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_26262 And when you get into industrial products: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_61508 And Aerospace: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DO-178B https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DO-178C 
This thread was painful to read. 
What is the client environment (desk/laptop, rasp pi, phone...)? What is your level of permission on the client side? Do you trust your users not to mess with the client side environment? How big are the files? How long does processing take (less or more than a few seconds)?
+1 to yes! I really enjoyed PyBay last year and the hallway track was as much fun as the talks...
Definitely going - totally worth it last year...
It would help if you tell us what the input you have is. If we're talking scanned handwritten notes this is probably going to be a doozy for a new programmer. If it's text you can probably just iterate through the file and have specialized routines for keywords. That said, if the notes don't have standardized formats for expressing those characteristics (like 'BP 126/82' vs. '126/82 BP') the problem becomes a little more complex again.
Test
That's why I have multiple setup scripts.
A word has been detected automatically. This is a test comment generated by a bot. Downvote this comment for removal.
It's not a circular argument, it's self an actual reinforcing cycle. Those are different things.
Looks cool. Now we just need a good OpenGL+Python tutorial. 
RStudio is written in C++. Word is, they didn't have RStudio to help them develop it in R so they chose C++. I think you mean RShiny by RStudio - the R web framework which touts not needing to know html or javascript to build a web app. Problem is, to use RShiny commercially you need to pay RStudio, the company, for a license.
Noice!!! 
You can't run multiple lines of code like that in an interactive shell. Type them in one by one.
oh right, perfect. thanks. one more question for you: What's the difference between double quotes " " and single quotes ' ' e.g. when I simply type 'Hello world' , I get an error but not with the double quotes. (and why does the end result only have one quote?)
There is no difference. Can you show the error you're getting with single quotes?
Will go there too.
I was wondering: how are you synchronizing the graphics update to the screen? I toyed a bit with animation using Tkinter myself, and am using after_idle() and after() but it's not really reliable and doesn't work very well when aiming for a certain frame rate. https://github.com/irmen/rocketsimulator/blob/master/tkanimation.py

my mistake. never mind. I can no longer see the error. 
I just use after() in a mainloop with delay of 16ms which is about 60fps :)
why is C so popular in mobile? is this low level, operating system stuff?
I only have 1 answer to this. Look how many pure java job openings there are and how many pure python job offerings. Python is seen as a starting language, that's why it's googled a lot, that's why its the nr1 in rankings. But it's not the nr1 language, because, that is java. 
That sounds fascinating - how the hell did they manage to do that, on a practical level? As in, how did you enter the rules and the goal? Through template magic, or was some library involved? I'm interested because C++, or any purely imperative language, seems such an extreme mismatch with the core ideas of logic programming.
Python is also a scripting language.
I put [Worksets](https://github.com/DozyDolphin/Worksets) on github a little over a week ago. Depending on what you mean by "window tiling app", It might suit your needs if xfce support was added? I'm currently working on support for gnome-shell and linux mint (which is working albeit a few minor bugs). It's just a small learning project, and I haven't got all the documentation in order yet, but I'll be happy to assist if I could lure you to try and add support for xfce :-) EDIT: Changed link to point to readme/repository instead of [wiki](https://github.com/DozyDolphin/Worksets/wiki/How-to-use-worksets)
Look cool. It being in the "yet another" category, will probably be a big hurdle, but cron could really use an update. I really hope this can succeed. Do you have plans for the future? (e.g. distribution, missed cron handling, overlap prevention, sequencing, timeout enforcement)
RIP ActionScript
I find the lack of python2 syntax disappointing.
