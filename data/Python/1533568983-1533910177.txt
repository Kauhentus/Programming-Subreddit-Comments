Thank you. Going to read it now :)
"the data science community is firmly stuck on 2.7" wasn't even true in 2015 when this book was written, and much less so now. The author also states that he is working on a new edition of this book, using Python 3.6.
I don’t think I’m that far considering some stories I’ve read where people were able to get a job as a junior dev but every job posting I see require years of experience if not having bunch of other stuff that I don’t know. Typical positions seem to be looking for like 3-5 years of python experience, stuff like automatic testing framework, AWS, Big Data like spark and Hadoop, statistical modeling, Rest API, statistical modeling, etc. Obviously some of the requirements differ in the position such as data analysis, etc but all the requirements seems to be out of reach. So I’m just learning everyday regardless, sending out resume and trying to put stuff up on github. Haven’t heard back from most of the stuff I applied for
The most widely used tool to share code and results is [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/), you can also embed [widgets](http://jupyter.org/widgets) inside jupyter notebooks. If you are looking to build a nicer dashboard with more callback and controls and deploy it for production, I find an easy to use tool is [plotly dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) , which I have used both internally and externally to great success.
I haven’t used Django before, but I absolutely love Flask, used it for a personal project and got the company I interned at to allow me to use it for a project. Can’t recommend enough
&gt;I am looking for some constructive criticism on the same. * I suggest you spend some time doing test recordings and reviewing the footage after. Do that before you even start to jump into code. Even if your content is terrific, it's really hard to watch something that is painful to listen to and where all the text is fuzzy because of the resolution. * The audio quality is pretty awful. * While recording turn off any fans or A/C. * Try to catch yourself making filler noises (ahhh ummm etc) and stop yourself. * Record your video in 1080p minimum. * Don't skip steps if they are vital to the function of your bot. * Don't premake screenshot tiles, or at least show how to make 1 or 2 of them * If you're going to show what you preinstalled it, then include recording of your installation process. Speed up the video if need be. * Don't include the sound of you just typing unless you're talking at the same time and it can't be helped. * Or, addressing the prior point, get a quieter keyboard * Cut out sections of emptiness where nothing is happening. (Sections where you cut between google slide and different windows. Or when opening up websites.) * If you have specific sections of the docs you want to talk about have them all prebookmarked/opened so you can jump straight from point 1 to point 2 to 3 to 4 etc. * Utilize camera/window zooming. If what you are currently talking about is specific the minesweeper, then minesweeper can either be full screen, or the video can have it zoomed in to fill the entire area. * Touching on some of the previous points, if you're using something like OBS then learn how different scenes are setup and get comfortable switching between them. This would allow for a more "live" presentation and still allow you to incorporated post-production window focusing/zoom/window switching etc. * If you already have a plan on how you want to 
Well good luck on your journey, you'll get there!
Currently, Python developers are in demand for developing web applications, and machine learning related applications (data visualization, scientific computing, machine learning models, writing chatbots, etc.). Depending on your interests, you could pursue either of those. If you are interested, I can give you more details about what you would need to learn in specific. Your target should be to build an awesome portfolio of coding projects. Also look for internships, especially in smaller companies or startups. 
Start s blog and share what you have learned so far. It'd help in coming years in many ways.
Yeah, that left me scratching my head. It was true maybe about 2-3 years ago (maybe the print for that book is older), but I'd say that almost every major framework supports 3.6 as well or better than 2.7 at this point.
I worked in healthcare too, literally. Inpatient pharmacy, used python to analyze drug usage, write automated audits and eventually got "discovered" by the corporate pharmacy team while trying to sneak in a server. Anyways, I got hired on the spot once they saw my work, and now I'm not allowed to code anymore, I manage. Not sure if your story is going to be the same but, everyone has to start somewhere. 🙂 Good luck friend
Flask really is amazing. +1 on this
You are my savior, man! I learned the hard way that updating packages isn't always a good thing. From now on I will just use conda to update my environment and not manually try to update packages using pip. 
Basic career advice. Take a look at the jobs you want in the city you are moving to and see what the requirements are. And then build portfolio/resume/knowledge to match that. If they want Pandas + XXXX lib, then learn those. If they want Spark instead of Hadoop, go and learn Spark.
I managed to start python, start flask alongside, stop flask after learning enough, start django, build a website along, and now get a full time job with django where I manage AWS servers in 4 months. pdf is the greatest human invention ever. And yeah sentdex youtube channel too.
Is that on Windows?
I figured it wouldnt work out :/ . Decided to stick with node.js for this one. I will work keep learning Django to work on my personal project though.
I'm not a hiring manager, but I think it's extremely important to put your code on GitHub. I'm not a Ph.D., but I left an engineering Ph.D. program to become a software developer - I was actually doing work similar to what you did in graduate school and in undergrad. I fully believe my personal projects were a huge part to me landing a job - a lot of companies seemed interested, but didn't have that concrete evidence that I could code (undergrad degrees are in physics and mechanical engineering). Once I started putting all my code on GitHub, I was getting much further in the interview process, and eventually landed a job. 
Hard lessons :)
Got it. I'll see what I can apply moving forward
Using sqlite3 module to extract web browser history from local computers to analyze the browsing history datasets using pandas library and do data visualization with matplotlib. Anyone wants to see their browsing behaviors. Let me know!
I’ve never seen an internship opportunity that didn’t require being enrolled as a full time student. Am I just looking in the wrong places?
How did you get started with Python and what was the route that you took? I am pretty decent at Powershell, but looking to get into a real programming language to expand the skill set.
Thanks :)
If the internship is unpaid and you're looking to freelance anyways, consider linking up with another freelancer and see if you could shadow/help out
I disagree. Maybe it's not a classic, everyday kind of table, but it's a table containing complicated cells. Even if a cell is a list, it's still a table. And no reason that a table package can't do word wrap inside cells.
Which GUI kit is the best for customizing color options on the windows?
Thank you, @efmccurdy, for that additional bit of insight. I've not completed anything AI-based, Bayesian, or Binary filtration in nature. It makes sense (with my rudimentary understanding) that I need to give the system a baseline of what to look for and include/exclude. Hence, training. I'll continue to work on it: programming -- the best contact sport. =) I'll cross post to /r/learnpython, as well. Cheers.

For what it's worth, Django is considered a "batteries included" solution (e.g. it has its own builtin auth orm, web server, views, etc) while Flask requires you explicitly include/configure components you need. As such, learning Flask gave me a decent understanding of python web development while learning Django gave me a decent understanding of Django development.
Great thanks!
There are more important things than improving your code. It is to write a code that makes sense and others can easily understand. In your code the naming of the variable "chance" does not makes sense. The naming obfuscates its purpose. You increase the chance but you are less likely to win? How so? As you have mentioned in the comment, you should've called it "multiplier". That goes along with the intent of the code. Winning 100 percent of the time if you select 1 as multiplier doesn't make sense. In fact, the whole "elif" block does not align with the name "dice". To make it a dice game, make the player choose a number between 1-6. And roll a dice between 1-6 using the randint method you've used. If the player's number same as the rolled dice the player wins. You can now introduce multiplier to decide how much the player wins. After implementing this basic part of the dice, you may implement a range of values to select for the player. i.e. below or under a selected number wins. Can you find a way to adjust multiplier without using elif's. Also have you ever thought about how does randint generates random numbers. If nobody had seen your code, meaning you can cheat as much as you want, how could you write a python code that prints a random integer everytime it's executed. Only exception is that you don't have any random number library.
&gt; Dictionaries are unordered. Elements are not kept in any specific order. That is no longer true. In current versions, dictionaries are ordered by insertion. For example: &gt;&gt;&gt; d = {10: 20, 5: 4} &gt;&gt;&gt; d[1] = 100 &gt;&gt;&gt; d {10: 20, 5: 4, 1: 100}

Pycharm. It's easier to use than most editors which are too complicated to even execute code.
Yeah, life on Neptune is also compatible with reproducible builds. What's your point? There's a huge difference between compatible and being a tool useful to achieve that goal. If you say "I want to use Docker to achieve reproducible builds" it doesn't mean the same thing as "I will use the artifacts of my repeatable builds in Docker". Docker itself has a process of building something, viz. images. But, as a tool, it doesn't have a property of ensuring that the builds are repeatable. If you talk to an infrastructure programmer and tell them you want a reproducible Docker build, if they are any-what competent, they'd tell you "no, you cannot have it". But if you ask them if you can have an image with the artifacts from your build (the reproducibility of which you have ensured using other means), then they will be right to tell you "no problem!"
It really annoys me that sqlalchemy does all the hard work of reflecting an existing schema and the doesn’t provide a built-in solution for generating code. I use sqlacodegen but it requires a lot of hacks to work as I want it to (supporting multiple schemes, having snake_case attributes for tables with PascalCase column names, etc.).
How large is your table?
Find some problems in your healthcare job to solve; involving automation, data science and/or data management/visualization. Python will be appropriate for all of these. The web dev part is useful since at some point whatever problem you've decided to solve will benefit from a user-friendly and accessible UI. Since pretty much every end user has access to a web browser and probably uses one on a regular basis, it makes for a preferable platform to access your Python programs. But basically, the way you start is by automating yourself out of your job whenever possible. Then you move on to other problems/jobs.
What about the learning path for web applications?
Have you tried Codecademy?
Ya. Can't remember how far I got though and is in an account that I can't access anymore.
What kind of color options are you looking for?
Both noted. Tried codewars a long time a go and remember being a bit stuck on some of them. Growth of a population comes to mind specifically. Thanks!
Something where I can use hexcodes to define the colors for boxes and text 
" using python about webscrapping and data science. Also did a course on statistical analysi " Care to share exactly which courses you did on the above? Do you recommend? 
I would advise you to take a look on template matching using opencv , [here](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/01/26/multi-scale-template-matching-using-python-opencv/).
Here are forms with the same layout, etc, but the colors changed. [https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/43366713-37f8f074-9310-11e8-915b-3da26f0fc013.jpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/43366713-37f8f074-9310-11e8-915b-3da26f0fc013.jpg) [https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/43366714-38162b9e-9310-11e8-9749-a9b904f844d5.jpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/43366714-38162b9e-9310-11e8-9749-a9b904f844d5.jpg) [https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/43366716-38559d1a-9310-11e8-8540-9098656f7372.jpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/43366716-38559d1a-9310-11e8-8540-9098656f7372.jpg) Are these the kinda of color changes you're seeking? Note - at this time not all PySimpleGUI widgets have colors that can change. The "text" widget's color can be changed.
You might be hitting the limit of the number of parameters allowed in a SQL Server query (2,000 I think). The generated SQL uses parameters (instead of a simpler SELECT FROM VALUES statement), so it’s pretty limiting. Test the threshold for chunksize to see how much data you can have going in at once.
I was playing around with chunk size. Anything higher than about 50 seemed to fail. However, I just downgraded my pandas to 0.22 and that seemed to fix the problem.
If it annoys you _that_ much, then write some code and submit a PR. Complaining about the available features of an open source repo is like sitting on the couch staring at the TV remote and screaming "Why aren't you within arms reach!!!". Of course, if you don't need to change the channel that bad then the energy spent reaching for it probably isn't worth it.
I actually recorded a video of that 3 days ago lol, check: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TRAHa-hhPs&amp;feature=youtu.be) This was PySide2 
I vote for wxWidgets. Unlike Qt, its license basically allows you to do anything you want.
A new 'wrapper' package for tkinter was just released named PySimpleGUI. You can build nice looking GUIs, control the colors, look &amp; feel. It's built on tkinter and has no dependencies. It's not appropriate for a full-scale, 'fancy' GUI, but it's fantastic at mocking one of those up in a few minutes and seeing how it feels. A number of IT folks are using it as a front-end to their utilities. This will get you started pip install PySimpleGUI Tons of sample applications and recipes on the GitHub [https://github.com/MikeTheWatchGuy/PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/MikeTheWatchGuy/PySimpleGUI) Here's a sample layout: [https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/43366716-38559d1a-9310-11e8-8540-9098656f7372.jpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/43366716-38559d1a-9310-11e8-8540-9098656f7372.jpg)
Jesus christ. Try this instead. var = val.split("python is cool") for x in range(len(max(var, key=len))): for y in range(len(var)): t = var[y][x:x+1] if not t: t = ' ' print("{} ".format(t), end='') print() Python 3 only. 
If you want to quickly prototype a GUI that's fully functional with your own custom layout, try [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/MikeTheWatchGuy/PySimpleGUI). In 5 minutes you can put together and try out a GUI using the standard GUI widgets (those found in tkinter). This GUI was created in 20 lines of code.

PySimpleGUI may be exactly what you are looking for, at least to get you the buttons, checkboxes, etc. It doesn't integrate directly with pyplot, but you can at least setup your program's execution using a GUI and then run pyplot. pip install PySimpleGUI [https://github.com/MikeTheWatchGuy/PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/MikeTheWatchGuy/PySimpleGUI)

Except it doesn't, not even close. 
wxPython has several different color chooser widgets. It also has a ColourDB widget that uses hex codes that you might be able to use to adapt a new widget 
This is garbage. 
Or just leave SA alone and use PyDAL. That's what I do.

/r/learnpython is the place for these questions, just as an FYI. You want to nest this in a for loop. You have to specify an array element. For example: for name in names: print("Hello " + name + "!")
I must ask, why aren't you able to code anymore?
I think people are downvoting this a lot. Is it because it violates the stackoveflow terms ?
That's why I shared it hehe
In all honesty, I feel this is obviously a valid point. However, it should be noted that this bot is NOT faster than a human, and thus does not overload their servers. Every job application has a one minute waiting time, and between every click there are at least 2 seconds sleep time. It simply removed the repetitive task from the human...
The link you provided says "Lastly, it’s important to keep in mind that template matching does not do a good job of telling us if an object does not appear in an image." which was one of my two requirements.

Ahh, thank you.
Damn dude. PMd.
Sorry should have checked learning sub. You were right tho, have to use python3 not python. 
What did you do before? Because this sounds like complete bullshit. Unless I’m misunderstanding what you mean by manage 3 aws servers. We have a dba that deals with our servers. That shit takes years to learn. I feel like you are exaggerating what you do man. 
Keep in mind that with some GUI toolkits you lose the right to close-source your software. You can do whatever you want in Tkinter if you use override_redirect=1 on root... Just be warned that it will make your job 1000% more difficult, as the documentation is sparse and rarely correct for ttk widgets especially. A lot of that inconsistency is due to themes and the way they change the attributes available. ~Yee hath being warndedest~
I got hired into the "big thinking" department, basically we come up with ideas and have a group of coders(different department) that we manage using resource requisitions to make our vision come true. Coding is not something that is endorsed in the new department, and I work for such a big company that the beurocracy prevents me from gaining access into any of the production databases outside of using the "utilities" which are basically shitty webapps. The whole thing is that, IT gets outsourced often enough for basic enough tasks that people end up building a moat to prevent anyone from making meaningless work automated and efficient. I'm happy to have the new job, but at the same time I don't get to work on anything with my own bare hands anymore so I've been looking at transferring or moving to a different job. Lol the grass is always green on the other side until you get there.

My last 2 jobs were with Python/ Django and now my salary is $90k.
The easiest solution is with a lookahead and lookahead where the regex pattern matches the quote pattern only if it comes after a letter and is followed by more letters. re.sub("(?&lt;=[a-z])'(?=[a-z])", " ", test_string, flags=re.I)
Just scrolling through this article and looking at the `relplot` documentation (https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.relplot.html#seaborn.relplot) ... This looks like a regular scatter plot to me or am I missing sth? Also, the scatterplot() and lineplot() functions pretty much look like the plt.scatter and plt.plot equivalents in matplotlib to me, what's the advantage of doing it in seaborn?
You forget to switch accounts?
I think he just thought of more to say but didn't want to edit. 
thanks! great idea on keeping count. will try this out.
or just use all the free resources, lol
The biggest advantage is that you can use size, style, hue as well as rows and columns to segment and group your data. Seaborn takes care of the aggregation instead of manually doing it with pandas. For instance, if you wanted to build a matplotlib scatter plot with different markers, and colors, you would have many more steps. The other added benefit is that this is consistent with the other seaborn plot types (boxplot, violinplot, etc) so that once you get your data into the right format it is easy to iterate through with seaborn.
Post ads for both data-based web development and data scraping on places like Kijiji and Craigslist. Random individuals will respond, and you'll get the opportunity to work for a number of freelance clients (which can serve as references in the future, if needed). Even if you have no idea how to complete a project, charge them a little bit and learn while gaining experience dealing with people and solving real-world programming projects. Even if you're only working for $5.50/hour by the end of the project because you spent a lot of time learning and it turned out to be way harder than anticipated, you'll still learn tons!
Do check to see if you can check up on the status of a particular stop request. And if using the above method, probably add a generous time out to the wait for the task to be stopped, just in case the polling misses the window.
Interesting, have to try this in practice some time. I used seaborn a few years ago and didn't find it too useful vs matplotlib for simple plots. There's one thing I use seaborn for frequently though: scatterplot matrices 
hi, how did you learn flask from scratch? im currently reading the flask mega tutorial by miguel grinberg! still at chapter 1 though
I was thinking about doing a YouTube tutorial on flask.. and combine all the resources I had to find to learn it efficiently, would you be interested in that? I was thinking of teaching programming in as simple terms as possible to keep beginners from being intimidated. I did do some of the mega tutorial but got confused getting to the database connection stuff and different things like that. I mostly just had an app idea and googled my way through building it with flask. I think I am going to make a flask tutorial series though and see how that goes.
Pip install pandas at the command line. Then “import pandas as pd” in IDLE
You can try automate the boring stuff with python. The book is free to read online. It was written for non programmers so you will get by without objects and classes. I also dont know how to code before that, but now I was able to create a script to change my IP so that I can connect to xbox live 😀
yes would definitely be interested in a tutorial video like that! i’ve been muddling through flask, even bought a course in udemy but got lost at the start (instructor was going on about docker even before starting flask, so was very confused). do let me know once you’ve done the video!

Aren't Udemy courses nearly always on sale? Thus making the cost more like $16? Further, aren't Udemy courses made by individuals? Thus one Udemy course can be very different from another. Your issue is with the author of the course, not Udemy.
Sounds like your computer does not have a COM3 port. I think USB serial adapters usually start numbering around COM8. Go to your device manager, click on "ports" and find the COM number that your USB adapter was assigned. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
I bought that same udemy course, was also confused haha.. I’ll let you know man
Udacity. Not Udemy. 
My PC lists com ports 3 &amp; 4 which I use regularly. Device manager lists them a com3 &amp; com4. I'm using Python 3.7, Windows 8. 
&gt; re.sub("(?&lt;=[a-z])'(?=[a-z])", " ", test_string, flags=re.I) PERFECT! Thanks! Do you mind me asking what the flags=re.I means?
Udemy — Complete Python Bootcamp
You should first learn basic HTML+CSS(and bootstrap)+JS (nothing fancy, just the very basic of js), then learn the popular frameworks (Django and Flask) and the basic use of databases, then I recommend learning to use jQuery and how to make REST APIs to make some easy AJAX calls, with all that you can make a lot of things and it's not really so much to learn.
Haha! funny. I was hoping if you could help me out by pointing me in the right direction: I own and manage my own brand of footwear for ladies (with my wife), and we have a VIP-membership program. We keep track of our VIP members in a very old-school way: if a VIP member drops by a store, and her name is not in the records of that store (managed in an excel spreadsheet), our store's manager calls our other branches to check with them whether the VIP is listed under their branch. (I know, it's ridiculous!). Since I've been learning Python, I heard about Flask. So I thought I could do a website where all my store managers could log in and see a real-time updated, comprehensive, centralized database of all our VIP members, complete with their names, phone numbers, email addresses, date they became a VIP, originating store, and the works. I think this is possible to do and might be fairly simple with Flask. What do you think? Kindly note that I have a very basic knowledge of Python (did some web scraping a month before), and have zero knowledge about Flask... THANK YOU!
Thank you! I'll definitely gonna try this :-) 
Absolutely that can be done pretty simply, I’ll dm you!
You can create a portfolio so you can sell yourself, I recommend to learn mysql and create scripts that analyze the data in your way. 
I think a lot of people would agree that it's best to use Tkinter when an app is simple enough that it doesn't need more, but as soon as you need a web view widget or custom things not provided, you must select something else. After that the huge variety in licensing is only one of the factors. The type of app and type of licensing needed both affect the choice greatly.
Yes. I’m trying to get better at programming. I have a little bit of experience coding. I have done many small projects before but this is the first time I am doing something this big. I’m thinking of putting my code on github once I put all the pictures and videos that I need to.
This is almost certainly a really bad idea! But, you can base64 encode the binary data and store it in your source code. But you’re much better off loading it. Also, /r/LearnPython is the proper place for this question 
Thanks, I like the craiglist idea. Upwork and other big freelance website are just too competitive for my level
Thank you for telling me the proper subreddit to place this in. I would like to ask why you think it is a bad idea. Thanks for taking the time to reply
laffo
I feel like a real dumbass. I have never noticed that bookmark icon. My god, you've changed my Reddit experience forever.
Your code will balloon, and it will likely be slower than loading it when needed. I can just imagine this code taking forever to run and being miserable to edit. Now your text editor will have to also keep many, many megabytes (giga?) in memory Look at it this way: while it is certainly not a *universally* good argument, look around at what others do and notice it is extremely uncommon to see people doing it! (Again, not always a good reason not to, but worth considering)
Depending on where you will be, you may be able to leverage both. In my department at a national lab, nearly everyone has a PhD (mine’s in mechanical engineering) and having that plus coding skills puts you in a really good place. 
That is probably true. I have been wanting to do this for a very long time though. I have gathered a working neural network and such things to prepare for this. I just wanted to know how to save all the pictures as variables. I was trying to find a way to do it. I have installed every single package which has to do with deep learning. I have not found a way to create an ai to play video games, so this is the next best thing.

You can also use this forum to post questions to problems you are having. Projects like these don't necessarily get finished in the same day. I learned python by building a slack bot, took me 4-6 weeks before I was happy enough with the resulting user experience to call it done. Just working through the the problems one at a time.
As u/smcarre noted, you need to know reasonable amount of Python (understand classes and multi file Python packages and modules well), and need to know some basic HTML. Given that, I would recommend to start learning web development using Flask - it's easy to get started with it. I have found this tutorial very useful (and exhaustive) myself: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world
The difficult part is handling users, sessions, passwords, etc., and making sure that only your employees can use it. You really don’t want to expose anything online with sensitive data that could easily be hacked. That said, Django would be a better choice for this type of project. Also you’d want to make sure people couldn’t brute force the login, so use something like Django axes (its named something like that). Django has a steeper learning curve but is much more pleasurable of an experience developing with it for more complicated projects like the one you want to build. Just know that whatever you build could potentially be hacked because you’re just starting out.
Sounds like you didn’t read my post; I’m not using Docker for reproducible builds, I’m using pipenv for that. Docker is just the image format.
I will write about it and let you know! 
Learned about javascript Date object, looking forward to a deep dive into socket programming with python as reward.
Heads up, [Django Girls](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/) teaches you the easiest way to learn Django.
I spent a good amount of time with the Flask tutorials from the PrettyPrinted Youtube channel. The guy does a bang up job with the basics and some advanced topics.
creating enough data for my TensorFlow model by hand. kill me now. Also refining that model and tuning it 
Stick with what you enjoy, which sounds like it might be data science, you could burn out trying to learn HTML/CSS/FLASK/DJANGO/etc. The real challenge is focus, there are so many directions you can go with Python it can overwhelm and you will realize you can't do it all. I hear a lot of people talk down on Kaggle, but they all currently have Data Science jobs, and have completed Kaggle competitions in the past so don't listen to that, lots of DS job postings ask for your Kaggle profile. Network via Meetup.com, if your in a big city you can do it live, else virtually. In the past year I've done a few DS bootcamps, tons of MOOC's, meetups, and hundreds of apps, just landed my first data job. You're not too late, stick to it if you dig it and you'll be in a great place down the road! Message me if you like, good luck, whatever direction you go will pay off.
Cool! Thanks for the tip.
This is basically his version of a Udemy course he downloaded. You can see proof in [part 3/30 @ 7:00ish](https://youtu.be/Rd00pA_Revs?list=PLhTjy8cBISEp6lNKUO3iwbB1DKAkRwutl&amp;t=420), where he loads a video from a tkinter course to figure out an error he made; the code looked awfully similar. So, while the knowledge is appreciated, the seemingly plagiarized nature is a bit sketch.

If you're that locked into using hex for color codes, you could easily write a function to convert them to whatever color format the GUI package uses. Say if you wanted RGB values, convert the hex into an int, and perform this function on it: def int_to_rgb(int_color): r = (int_color &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 255 g = (int_color &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 255 b = int_color &amp; 255 return r, g, b 
It was a mistake to deprecate dependency links. I don't think it's going away any time soon. But, packaging in Python is fundamentally broken and any new attempt at doing anything about it ends up making something even worse than what it was before. So, frankly, rolling your own version of package manager could be just as good as any other alternative. Another way to think about this problem: if you need this for deployment, not development, you could try using your target system's package manager. I.e. instead of using `pip` or similar to install dependencies, use `apt` / `dnf` / `pacman` etc.
It depends on the context and on what the function does. In general you should be explicit about the arguments a function takes in order to make it easy to understand and therefore use.
If you want to do Data Science, start with data science. You can pick Python as you go. Just hop on Kaggle and do it. Also healthcare craves deep learning and computer vision scientists there are even courses now. And to be honest, it is not harder than programming and learning data structures, async, esoteric monads or whatnot.
I was wondering if there is a use there for making suitably abstract base classes, but that seems like it would be more like likely to cause confusion and break duck typing. 
Well, don't use `pipenv`. I think I wrote this before. That's just some koolaid for uninitiated. It doesn't do well even what it's designed to do, but it definitely isn't designed for the kind of role you imagine for it. But you are doing everything backwards. Instead of using a tool that's designed to do packaging and distribution of software, you use some sticks and stones and hope to make a spacecraft. I mean, instead of solving the problem of "how to make reproducible deployment of my Python code" you are solving a problem of "how do I make Docker and pipenv do what I think is a reproducible deployment". And, you are wrong in your understanding of what reproducible deployment is and in your choice of tools to that end. I'm sorry, it's not going to fly. ---- Just to illustrate where you went wrong. You say: &gt; I can't use pip because pip isn't deterministic Well, `pipenv` uses `pip` to install your stuff. So, you are out of luck. Delusion shattered? But it doesn't really matter if `pipenv` uses `pip` or not. The whole idea of relying on these tools to produce reproducible result is ridiculous. `pip`, in order to install anything, will execute `setup.py` of the library it installs. If that file contains anything like `if random() &gt; 0.5: put this file over there` you are out of luck, and no package manager in the universe will help you with your dream of reproducible builds.
Sure! I did the following, not in order: Using Python to Access Web Data by University of Michigan on Coursera- this is the web scrapping one, I think it gives a good intro but did not feel super in depth, I do recommend it though Python Data Structures by University of Michigan on Coursera- I used that as a review after edx 6.00.1x, it's all basics but easy and well layed out DAT101x: Introduction to Data Science by microsoft on EDX- this is a good intro to statistics for data science but I definitely need more practice there! A good simple overview though, it uses excel if I remember well. DAT208x: Introduction to Python for Data Science- Good to review python basics and good intro to numpy and panda, recommend it I'm also having fun doing the python path on Exercism, it's good practice and the guys on there are super nice and helpful, it's really helping me clean up my code. I'm not at the statistics on Khan's academy yet but I did read good things about it, I think it's worth checking it out :) Good luck! 
Lol it's my own Udemy course.
I had overwritten the `__getattr__` method of a class i had built so it would call the method i’d wrotten or, if that didn’t exist, it would call a different class’s version of the function and log that it was falling back to that. To do this, i used `*args, **kwargs`. it might sound complicated or bizarre, but I was making a sort of shell on top of an existing library that had some bonus functionality. It ended up working pretty splendidly!
Well done! I just got into data science with Python; this is a very inspiring project you've done. What course did you take for algorithmic trading with python. Maybe post the link. Thanks
Constructors should always use only kwargs, otherwise multiple inheritance won't work since when writing the base class you really have no idea about the call order.

For me it was understanding how the import system works. Once you do that, a whole new range of possibilities appear, like manipulating ``sys.path`` on runtime, dynamically loading modules, debugging various import errors and most importantly detecting and mitigating circular imports early on. Next thing was being accustomed to the pep8 coding standards early on, when I was switching from Java to Python. But once I got the rules and the best practices, the code became more readable and I became more productive in the long run.
I could see this argument being "constructors must always accept `**kwargs`", but why 'only'?
Another example would be inheritance. Say you had an Object that reads Images from disk: class BaseImageReader: def read_image(self, settings, path, mode="regular"): # code for reading image Now, you want to extend that using inheritance. For example a `LoggingImageReader`, which looks up logging configuration in `settings` and logs the reading attempt: class LoggingImageReader(BaseImageReader): def read_image(self, settings, *args, **kwargs): # do your thing with the logging # ... return super().read_image(settings, *args, **kwargs) This way, should the interface of `BaseImageReader.read_image` change, you would not neccesarily have to adjust `LoggingImageReader` and it's immediately clear to the reader that your version of `read_image` only uses `settings`. One could argue that this is just an elaborate way to wrap a function, but you don't necessarily have to call `super` in an overloaded method.
Learning how to structure a package peoperly and release it on PyPI. PyPA has done a lot of good work on this lately, to make things better. It's still not good yet, mostly because of legacy issues, but a few years ago it was a hot mess and it was very easy to get on the wrong track.
Your Microsoft SQL database is the issue. Check its configuration. By the way, use Postgres, you'll be much happier with it. It's much more performant, configurable and scalable (totally debatable) and is better supported in general. 
When you override methods of a parent class, (unless you use MyPy which will let you know you're compatibility with parent types at check time)
If adding this feature to sqlalchemy were equivalent in difficulty to reaching for a remote control I'd have done exactly as you suggest a long time ago. Opining a missing feature isn't invalid just because something is open source (and I do make open source contributions where I can add something of value).
Thats oversimplifying. There are a lot of places where a variable number of arguments makes sense. It wouldn't be possible to provide the beautiful api Django or SqlAlchmey provide without using `**kwargs`
ok, next time...

What are you struggling with?
Ha. I have this course. Haven’t gone through the whole thing yet but it’s on my plate. Honesty I wouldn’t submit an algorithm to quantopian. What stops these people from copying your algorithm and using it as their own? It’s intellectual property especially if you create a good algorithm. For data science, Jose Portilla also has that as well. I have the Data science with python and data science with R, both from Jose Also, use google promo code for $10. I always buy courses for $10
This looks super-handy, thanks! I always struggle just trying to make simple animations of data, so this looks like it will help a lot. I'm especially glad to see a pcolormesh example, as that's something often left out of plotting libraries
the white patch is the crop region of the orginal image. The crop patch when viewed separately can be seen separately but when inserted to a blank canvas created by numpy zeros gives me that. Can someone explain why?
Because my account has not two weeks old. 
What is "SO"? I've been here only two weeks. 
Oh, thank you. I'll try this. But what is "SO"? I don't know about "SO".
Any reason not to just take a list that contains lists?
I still have problem learning the whole database model thing and how it works with the rest of a web application.
It looks great! I'm also a physics student who loves doing animations, so I've thought about getting my hands dirty with matplotlib to get more customization/better handling of artists. I have some questions: how difficult was it to understand how mpl works? Also, what kind of knowledge is necessary to do this kind of things? I just started with Python a month ago so I really don't know much about this. 
If it breaks multiple inheritance I'm all for it.
That would be an equivalent solution, just takes an extra set of brackets.

Thanks a lot! Algorithmic trading is a growing interest of mine and I'll definitely take that course especially cos its taught by Jose! I've taken a course by him in the past. Rn I'm going through sentdex's youtube series for python x machine learning. Any advice?
Isn’t matplotlib faster than most regular python functions though so fairly reasonable for render time? Are you trying to do real time weather map rendering?
&gt; Also PyVideo does not tell you which is the best video in each category. Why would you want it to? Pyvideo's purpose is to be a searchable/filterable index of videos, not to make judgments of opinion about them. Also, no offense, but your account and your site come off as awfully spammy.
Looks really cool. Making animations in Matplotlib is a pain in the arse, so this is a really nice idea. The docs look great, and you've clearly thought through your API. I'd put some code into your readme. It's all well and good having those awesome animations, but someone could make those _without_ animatplot - it's the code that's different.
If you supply positional arguments, how do you determine which argument is meant for which constructor(s)?
you are using a python built-in type "complex" which does not understand numpy arrays. I don't think there's a direct equivalent of matlabs 'complex' function. To create a complex array you could do:: from numpy.random import normal re = normal(0,1,( blah blah )) im = normal(0,1,( blah blah )) n = re + 1j*im
alright great thx!
Sick! I used matplotlib for my first year uni project just a few months ago. I built a sentiment analysis tool - this would’ve been a great addition. I’ll probably look to improve my program and utilise animatplot at some point. Cheers!

When unit testing and you’re mocking functions but don’t need to access the mock, it’s convenient to use *args because. Makes the code much cleaner because you don’t have many unused parameters in your test function.
Hi, Not sure if this is the appropriate place to ask this but I have the following error. [macOS, anaconda notebook, mpl 2.2.2, py3.5]. Thoughts? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ImportError Traceback (most recent call last) &lt;ipython-input-14-f9144642d7b0&gt; in &lt;module&gt;() 2 import numpy as np 3 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ----&gt; 4 import animatplot as amp ~/anaconda/envs/tensorflow/lib/python3.5/site-packages/animatplot/__init__.py in &lt;module&gt;() 1 from ._version import __version__ 2 from .timeline import Timeline ----&gt; 3 from .animations.animation import Animation 4 from . import blocks, util ImportError: No module named 'animatplot.animations'
you should use `dtype = object` here. It will make pandas treat the cells as they are saved. if you have a .csv file with a cell .05 in it, and formatted in Excel like 5% it will be read as .05. As, it is saved this way
One thing I'd recommend when doing this (and many other situations when using **kwargs) is to use the functools.wraps decorator. This does stuff like setting the correct argument signature, making it nicer for stuff like help(), doc generation and autocompletion tools. Ie. with your version, you get: &gt;&gt;&gt; help(logImReader.read_image) Help on method read_image in module __main__: read_image(settings, *args, **kwargs) method of __main__.LoggingImageReader instance Note the `*args` and `**kwargs`, meaning help() no longer tells you what args this accepts, or the defaults etc. But if you do: class LoggingImageReader(BaseImageReader): @functools.wraps(BaseImageReader.read_image) def read_image(self, settings, *args, **kwargs): ... You get: Help on method read_image in module __main__: read_image(settings, path, mode='regular') method of __main__.LoggingImageReader instance Ie. the full method signature.
I'm failing on the AJAX calls. I know django and other stuff but make more dynamic with AJAX or fetch I see that so hard or maybe I need various tutorial to learn more about this and user CBV with it. Thanks! and u/amang0112358 too :D
&gt;n+1 You're not doing anything on this line - you want `n+=1` here (or just use the commented code instead). Without that +1, this will always produce an odd result, meaning it'll always keep growing.
Easy, you have already taken a lot of big steps then. I can't really recommend a tutorial on AJAX because someone at work taught me, however I used the w3schools tutorial as a reference while learning (I'm still learning also), maybe it can work for you. Also if you have any particular question I may be able to help you.
Did you create a directory named 'animatplot' to test this out? You may have stomped on the namespace
Thanks for that. 
Overall, you need to design the interprocess comms protocol. There are lots of tools to help with this (each with many pros and cons). Start with the python multiprocessing package. Then look into zeromq (pyzmq), RPyC, Apache Thrift. (I'm sure there's plenty more but these are ones I've used). If you have big data objects (e.g. images) to pass between processes, using shared memory is more efficient than serialising it down a pipe/socket. In this case, numpy.mmap is great for setting up chunks of memory which to can structure how-you-like and have random access to. Finally, how about you expose your API as a Thrift C++ service which other processes can call (using python or the language of their choice). It seems Thrift now supports Pipes for IPC (as an alternative to sockets) which might provide a more secure and performant option for IPC on a single host. Thrift servers can be single or multi-threaded. In your case, if the parent process is already managing the threads, you could launch a single-threaded thrift server in one thread as a module, and launch a subprocess (python or other) which calls back to that server on its own pipe. 
Not really in particular, but ultimately, you're generating a graph. Ie each number is a node that links to another number, eventually funnelling down the chain, so maybe something like graphviz?
Thanks I'll look into it.
Looks like that's what he did. Man, I've done that once or twice and it's crazy how long it takes to notice that.
Here is a solution using a new tkinter wrapper called PySimpleGUI. The exact same GUI screen as in the example can be created using this code: import PySimpleGUI as g form = g.FlexForm('Registration form', auto_size_text=True) layout = [ [g.Text('Registration Form', size=(20,1), font=('Helvitica', 20))], [g.Text('Full name', size=(15,1)), g.InputText()], [g.Text('Email', size=(15,1)), g.InputText()], [g.Text('Gender', size=(15,1)), g.Radio('Male', group_id=1), g.Radio('Female', group_id=1)], [g.Text('Country', size=(15,1)), g.Combo(values=('select your country', 'USA', 'Other'))], [g.Text('Programming', size=(15,1)), g.Checkbox('Java'), g.Checkbox('Python')], [g.Submit(button_color=('white', 'red'))] ] form.LayoutAndRead(layout) Here is the resulting GUI window: [https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/43774114-120c713a-9a16-11e8-95cb-913c4ef68244.jpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/43774114-120c713a-9a16-11e8-95cb-913c4ef68244.jpg)

Ester Egg is a typo, and section on unit conversion looked empty, otherwise, Neat!
Thank you! I will fix them. (Its also open source: https://github.com/agiliq/tweetable-python)
Nope, not to my knowledge. I'll try on a different machine later. I originally installed within notebook to my conda env, with !pip install animatplot. Tried in another env and a py27 env. Also tried deleting all files/dir with 'animatplot' in it. Thanks for the help!
Have you looked at [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) yet? I've first seen it out in the wild in the [Spacy docs](https://spacy.io/). It looks useable for what you describe here, or appears to be usable as a base for what you want to create.
“Head First Python” is a good way to start. It also covers Unix-like OS platforms. 
I'm trying to get ideas to tell people when they ask me about how to break into the healthcare industry as an analyst. I didn't have to make portfolios back when I graduated so I'm lacking in the advice department. Thank you. 
Thanks for sharing. Ive have wasted ungodly amounts of time getting the animations to work on matplotlib
Whats the name?
how about : "well, PrettyTable is for classic tabular data structure". See if you can stuff your data structure into RDBMS, or heck even Excel first then we can debate what a table pkg should be able to support ? 
If all goes well should have another part next week. The week after at the latest depending on my work schedule. I’m glad you enjoyed it! If there’s a something specific you want to see let me know. 
I see that it says the word "bits" on that page, but I don't see any evidence in the docs or the code that it actually will handle this. Can I read out just 3 bits in the middle of nowhere?
A bot that scrapes nba game data from espn and posts it to Reddit! Still trying to get the hang of BeautifulSoup
If you've got 240 bits and wanted 3 bits starting after the 27th bit, you'd just do something like: cf = bitstruct.compile('u27u3u210') _, my_bits, _ = cf.unpack(my_data)

I think that abstract base classes are almost always unnecessary in a language like Python but where they do exist they should very clearly and very explicitly define a contract that descendants must implement and consumers rely on. Accepting generic arguments just to be generic (rather than because it makes sense to do so semantically) destroys the fundamental role that an abstract base class is used for.

I virtually never use it. My design philosophy is, that function should ideally do just one thing, so I write larger number of short functions, and as a consequence of "one thing" rule, my functions usually have 0, 1, or 2 params max. If I need to feed more parameters, they are usually related to some object, so they are coupled together in some class, namedtuple etc.
ok, I did every line now. \*plz work\*
It does :). You should just let your editor do the job. Most code editors do it automatically.
Is Edx one of the best free course programs out there? Seems to be mentioned a lot more than usual.
How about those arguments that are common to all constructors (which it's hopefully most of them)? `self` is a good example. But I'm not following. How do you determine which argument is meant for which constructors when using kwargs? 
Sorry I asked the question in a confusing manner, is there a list of the order to take the courses, and is it worth forking the cash to get actual certificates? (Should be noted, Python will not help my career advancement, doing an MBA for that, but I like the tool set Python provides and am looking to go further into it for such purpose).
One of the idea was to do a talk on Pyxel, trying to make something funny for the attendees :) [https://github.com/kitao/pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel) I'll let you know what I end up doing :)
Is it allowed to keep a list of completed courses and use on a resume/skill set list if you haven't purchased the certs?
One last question, are there any other course sites or certificate sites you would recommend? 
Thanks for sharing ! Animated plots are in my future I will definitely be taking a look at your resource. 
Because `+=` creates a new object every time, and that slows things down quite a bit.
Isn't `s = s + 'whatever'` identical to `s += 'whatever'`?
wxPython integrates with matplotlib pretty well. The community is great and the documentation has come a long way from what it once was.
I'm excited to announce v1.0 of notifiers. This has been a real passion project for me, and I'm psyched that it seems to resonate well with others as well. Main features: - Generic interface to send notification to various providers - Data validation via JSON schema, block errors before they are sent - Extensive CLI client - Ability to use a logger, log directly to your favourite notification providers Docs: http://notifiers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 
Yes, the resulting `s` is a new object.
What does not working mean even? Does it not provide the output you expect? Is it not even running? You gotta help us out.
I know that, that's why I asked the question. OP: &gt; **s = s + **b'\0' * (5 - leftover) # Don't use += ! /u/K900_ : &gt; Because += creates a new object every time, and that slows things down quite a bit. Me: both create a new object because they're functionally identical.
I'd watch it, and I'd recommend putting 2018 or the Flask version or something in the title, it's been around for awhile so finding stuff up to date can be tough. Personally I'd be more likely to click it in search results if I knew it was recently made.
Added to my to-watch list. Looking forward to it. 
Very interesting. Have you talked to any matplotlib devs, whether such a functionality could be added or merged into matplotlib? 
Same here on both Windows 10 and Arch Linux the problem is that the animation and block packages are omitted in setup.py

If you pass in something mutable, like a bytearray, "+=" would modify the incoming object, which you don't want to do.
It depends. If s is mutable, then the object is usually modified in-place instead of creating a new object. This can lead to side effects if, for instance, more than one name is referring to the same object at the start.
You first need to json.loads() the text. Then dumps() that
It could have also been something with a custom `__add__` and the input is converted to `bytes` if it's not a `byte{s,array}` object on line 154. So that's probably not why [Guido](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/4581ae5fa2450db3f00384e4b2e86654605100d4#diff-088665aaaabc5b5cbb0834e0c4938f21) did not use `+=`.
The commands in the "preparation" step won't work, they need to be python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade twine Medium really uses em dashes in code blocks? That's dumb as hell. Lines starting with commas are non-standard, fix that `setup.py`. You should use normal quote characters for string literals - you've used a total hodge-podge of different characters, some of which python will not accept or correctly pair up. As per PEP8, do all of your imports at the top of the file. As per PEP8, arguments in functions and list literals should be separated with "`, `". You should only use one `#` per comment line unless you're distinguishing between different sorts of comments, which you're not, because you're using `###` for all of them. `del` is a statement; using it like a function works but it should be used properly (`del messymodule`) by preference. &gt; Users should never have to write `from usefulthing import UsefulThing` when they could write `import UsefulThing` You don't have a say in that because it needs to be imported from your root package anyway. This might be a good article making valid points about what is certainly a terrible distribution system, but these obvious issues prevent me from taking it (or the author) seriously, and will be an unnecessary impediment to anyone who could actually learn from it. The people who upvoted should take the time to actually read some of it.
not for every object, it depends on how do you define it. a = [] b = a a = a + [1] a &gt;&gt;&gt; [1] b &gt;&gt;&gt; [] But a = [] b = a a += [1] a &gt;&gt;&gt; [1] b &gt;&gt;&gt; [1] 
I'm more interested in the case relevant to this question, i.e. byte strings.
Doesn't make much sense to me. That comment was [added by Guido](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/4581ae5fa2450db3f00384e4b2e86654605100d4#diff-088665aaaabc5b5cbb0834e0c4938f21R151) while trying to make a test pass during the transition to python 3 (with the switch from `str` to `bytes`), but nothing there suggests why he added it. I can think of no reason why you would want to avoid `+=` with bytes. Python doesn't have "call by value". What I mean to say is that the bytes aren't mutated, which shouldn't be surprising since bytes objects are immutable.
&gt; A Java learner can’t execute a simple “Hello World” without dealing with packaging, distribution, and usually a few environment configuration errors. Nothing could be more wrong than this. To get Java to run a hello-world program, you need to know how to compile and how to load it. You need to know how to compile it so that it runs as a program. How to invoke Java, so that it understands that you mean to run something. At the basic level, you'll end up writing an Ant script to do that for you, but that will be a very bad idea, and as soon as you want to do something more like calculator, rather than a hello-world, you'll need Maven or Gradle, and you'll need to learn about packaging and running etc. In my experience, of students taking intro to CS with Java, about half won't be able to compile and run any Java program of any complexity after graduating the course. With Python, this is not a problem. Bottom line: it is *easier* to run hello-world in Python, than it is in Java. However, this says nothing about Java packaging system in general. It's actually kind of OK. Not great, but one can get used to it. This is while Python's packaging system is chaos and disappointment, but not for the reasons you mention.
&gt; This might be a good article making valid points about what is certainly a terrible distribution system, but these obvious issues prevent me from taking it (or the author) seriously, and will be an unnecessary impediment to anyone who could actually learn from it. Really? You're missing the point by getting caught up in pedantry. You have some valid points about code style, but it just doesn't matter. It's not reasonable to completely ignore the article because you don't like the code style. The article isn't about code style. And where does this come from? It seems like you made it up. &gt; You should only use one # per comment line unless you're distinguishing between different sorts of comments
let me add some more details to my problem. I am printing a dictionary using json.dumps(). One of the key in that dictionary is a text which can have a json as value. I want to print the value as is when i print output of json.dumps().
Ah. That would be why I didn't have that issue. Editable install. I'll push a fix asap.
Mutable objects are relevant to this question, since the b32encode() function accepts any bytes-like object, including bytearrays.
&gt; we're talking about byte strings. Not exclusively.
The real reason that this comment was added is because [back then](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/4581ae5fa2450db3f00384e4b2e86654605100d4?diff=unified#diff-088665aaaabc5b5cbb0834e0c4938f21R151) bytes objects were mutable.
&gt;I think that abstract base classes are almost always unnecessary in a language like Python but where they do exist they should very clearly and very explicitly define a contract that descendants must implement and consumers rely on. Accepting generic arguments just to be generic (rather than because it makes sense to do so semantically) destroys the fundamental role that an abstract base class is used for. Disagree incredibly strongly here. Abstract classes are huge for things like Django if you want to write re-usable code.
It's not pedantry. Half of your code examples don't run, wouldn't give particularly helpful error messages, and are awkward for users to fix. It's literally *harder* to write the broken nonsense you have than it would have been to just use the quotation marks and hyphens on your damn keyboard. &gt; you don't like the code style It's not a personal dislike. It's objectively counter to python community style guidelines. We all benefit from everyone following style guidelines in cases where they don't have a reason not to. Tutorials targeted at less experience developers, therefore, should be exemplary in their adherence to those guidelines. If I wanted to learn something about how to write formal letters in English, and the first paragraph of the tutorial was "yo thiz is who i rite good so u cn right 2", of course I'm not going to take the author seriously as any sort of authority on the subject.

not so nice those end
I'd heard of functools.wraps but this made it clear exactly where I should be using it. Really good explanation thanks.
In this case wouldn't it be more normal to just implement a [key function](https://wiki.python.org/moin/HowTo/Sorting#Key_Functions) for the builtin `sorted` function? Unless you can't do that for some reason.
I love its looks. I read through python code and it also looks quite nice and simple, though I have some suggestions to make it prettier :) Instead of having 6 string constants for html in the beginning you could have 3 if you used string format function. And those constant would probably be more readable. Saving dict to files in every function looks exactly the same. Only thing that differs is file name and dict. You could make function out of it. In Renault function while handling exception warning says "An exception occured while connecting to HAAS" ;) Also why did you decide to split it to two repos? It's really strange. What are pros of it?
So you have json in your dict? Eg: {"Foo": &lt;json blob here&gt;} ?
Basically, you now have a string inside a string. You can't avoid escaping quotes here.

As someone who inherited a codebase where this was done a few hundred times... please don't fucking do this, it's really dumb and a maintenance nightmare.
The article doesn't even try to answer the question "When do I want to use Elixir?"
What about them? Are you asking what are they? The most immediately useful to you right now would probably be the sidebar of this sub.
Yes
Do you still need to learn both Elixir and Erlang? I tried Elixir 2 years ago, and at the time there was so much "we're not going to provide a library in Elixir since there's already one in Erlang, so learn enough Erlang to use the Erlang library". I don't want my brain in two language contexts while writing code, just provide useful wrappers. As a point of clarification, I'm not nitpicking here, but talking about fundamental libraries like the one to do math operations. It's pretty important for every language to have a solid math library, and it turned me off that I had to drop out of Elixir while learning it to go look up how to use the Erlang library. Even a generated wrapper would have been an acceptable option.
Why is it the least informed are always the snarkiest? Look, pretty much all of your claims are wildly off base. `pip` is a package manager (and not a particularly good one). It doesn't support reproducible builds nor does it support deployment to our infrastructure. You may like it a lot, but you can't wish it into becoming a reproducible build tool or an image format. If you don't know what you're talking about, I recommend reading along while more knowledgeable people discuss, asking occassional polite questions.
Quantopian is a fun place to work if you're beginning to learn and has most of the must have libraries available plus you get access to an insane amount of datasets. Alternatively spin up a VM on Linode, AWS or whatever, setup a VPN and host notebooks on that. 
Yeah, you need to know some Erlang: basically, how to call Erlang code in Elixir and how to use Erlang documentation. Generally it is pretty easy: NativeElixirModule.some_method() :some_erlang_module.some_method() # You can also do this alias :some_erlang_module, as: SomeErlangModule SomeErlangModule.some_method() And some Erlang abstractions does leak to Elixir, like lists: iex(8)&gt; [40, 41, 42] '()*' Why the above happens? Because Erlang strings are just a charlist. Elixir have a proper string type (that is, using double quotes instead of single quotes), however since we have charlists using single quotes, this may be confusing for beginners. Except for those cases, no, you don't need to know too much about Erlang to be proeficient at Elixir.
I believe I have fixed it. Tested on my machine and a friends. You'll need to trying installing the newer version 0.2.2 pip install animatplot==0.2.2
I would do it as Nx, Ny, Nz = 5, 5, 5 n = np.random.normal(0, 1, ([3, 1, Nx, Ny, Nz]) n += np.random.normal(0, 1, ([3, 1, Nx, Ny, Nz])*1j If you don't care about the contents, then you can create a double sized array and view it as the entries of the complex function. n = np.random.normal(0, 1, ([3, 1, Nx, Ny, 2*Nz])).view(complex) 
As a beginner, what are you best online tutorials or resources to learn python? I’ve heard code academy is good but I was wanting to see others opinions.
And there is this one blog post, explaining "Why Elixir?": https://www.theerlangelist.com/article/why_elixir
Or why would I want to learn Elixir if I already know Python. What can Elixir do that Python can’t or what is it better at?
Just finished the first 50 problems on Project Euler
That worked!
That worked!
So it's trying to be the functional version of Python? Got it.
So its trying to be the Functional version of Python? Got it.
 A bytearray + something = new bytearray. A bytearray += something ends up modifying the *original* bytearray in place, which is unexpected for a pure function. As bytearrays and bytes have a deep relation (bytes are immutable bytearrays) and many stdlib functions are written to handle both, that’s why `s = s + ...` is used - side effect avoidance for mutable and immutable data types of a string. 
This looks very useful! However, most of my plots involve making more complicated plots containing several lines/points/axes formatting. So far, the easiest way I've found to produce animations has been by saving each frame as a standalone image and then animating with imagemagick or some python-based image library. Would it be possible to create a convenience function/decorator that lets you animate all of the `fig` objects returned by a function? Example: import animatplot as amp import matplotlib.pyplot as plt def animation(): 
What of the online resources have you looked at? What were your thoughts on them? Being a beginner can mean a wide range of things. If there's a sidebar resource you like, or don't like, I can help you understand that. But I am not going to build a python beginner course for you here in the comments. That isn't the purpose of this sub, and, as I've hinted at, the sidebar should tell you that. "I want to be told what to do, not read and explore for myself" is such a common post on this sub I am literally writing a bot to deal with it. It should comment on here in a few minutes, though your question in the post is phrased strangely enough that it might determine you're making a statement not asking a question. (As I am writing this and see that the bot hasn't posted, I'm going to guess that's what happened) Still though, you've asked a question, and if I see that you're really trying to learn and use the resources available to you, I'd be more than happy to help. I just need to see that you are trying to learn. Look at the links in the side bar and click through them, try out their examples, and get a feel for which resources suit your learning style. Then when you run into an issue, I can help. It's going to be much easier to learn python if you have a project in mind that you're trying to get to work by the way. That way you can work through examples online, and think about how that example could help you solve your problem. If the bot misses this post, I'll do its job for it. In the future, this kind of question is suited for /r/learnpython, as this sub is not the proper place for learning questions, and the users on that sub are very happy to help anyone who shows that they're trying to solve their problem on their own first, and are still stuck after searching for an answer online. 
I would enjoy it if you’re just giving it away. I use pycharm(community edition of course) and I’m working with python after learning java a few years ago. 
This looks great! Automating animated plots is something I've been messing about with myself. Suggestion: How hard would it be to write convenience functions for integration with the [xarray library](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/)? xarray already has a thin [wrapper around matplotlib](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/plotting.html) which allows you to easily plot different types of dataset intuitively. Integration with animatplot would be awesome, because then you could plot a gif of an xarray dataset just by something like from xarray import load_dataset data = load_dataset('fluid_2d_simulation_output.nc') data['density'].plot.pcolormesh.animate(animate_over='time') This is something I would potentially be interested in helping with, because I would use it all the time! 
How are you browsing reddit? If you're not on mobile, the side bar is the collection of information on the right side of this subreddit specifically visible when using the [the old site layout](https://old.reddit.com/r/Python/) (avoid the new layout if at all possible)
From what I've seen if it's not tkinter it's probably Qt for Python, package name PySide2. They recently made it simpler to use too, you can just use pip and you're good to go.
very nice your "basic animation" tutorial works now!
This sort of defeats the purpose of Animatplot (drawing lots of figures is both slow, and not interactive). Animatplot does have the ability to use multiple axes with multiple lines (even lines of different lengths for each frame). Right now, Animatplot does not have the ability to change the axes attributes dynamically (but it will). Animatplot just requires the data to be pre-generated (less you use the Nuke block or a similar block that will be in a future update).
Fair enough, thanks!
That looks super awesome. Animatplot should be capable of producing an animation like that, but the data just needs to be in the right form. I am planning on adding a proper `Animatplot.animations` submodule that will have a set of animation tools that conveniently combine certain types of blocks (like a vector plot composed of a pcolormesh for magnitude and a normalized quiver plot for direction), so there is definitely a place for it in Animatplot. Feel free to open a feature request as an issue to track progress. I'd obviously need to take a closer look at xarray. A good start would be attempting to make the animation with animatplot's current tools.

Updating projects that have fallen by the wayside mostly, found out some APIs had changed so I had to do some rip-n-replace work to get it all back together
I’m not familiar with Django and so it may be that abstract base classes are part of the framework, but I’ve rarely seen an abstract base class used in a way that wouldn’t be solved either using composition using something like the strategy pattern or by free functions operating on the object. Again, it’s not to say there is no good use but in my experience and in my opinion the times when an abstract base class is a good solution are fairly far and few between.
That's another solution for simple cases. I do that with some, but other times the sorting is more complicated and the code is easier to read as a separate function. 
When running two animations in the same notebook, I get this error. Any ideas? &gt; /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/matplotlib/cbook/deprecation.py:107: MatplotlibDeprecationWarning: Adding an axes using the same arguments as a previous axes currently reuses the earlier instance. In a future version, a new instance will always be created and returned. Meanwhile, this warning can be suppressed, and the future behavior ensured, by passing a unique label to each axes instance. warnings.warn(message, mplDeprecation, stacklevel=1) 
Let's just get to the point. How fast is it?
Whats it like to distribute it? Can it be reduced to an executable application, or must it always be given as a .lua for a user to run?
I just close the previous animation before running the next. You could probably create a new figure and axis, and then pass the axis into the animation blocks as a keyword argument (```amp.blocks.Block(..., axis=new_axis)```). 
Try /r/learnpython. Show them the code you have and describe where you are stuck. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. &gt; there are about a billion different scenarios No, there's only 4. You need a if block with 4 cases. 
Boasting about being easy to read while using regex does seem right. The one about removing repeated whitespace could easily be done with a split (and filter, if you care about newlines) and join
It can be packaged as an application. You can [additionally obfuscate the scripts](https://love2d.org/wiki/Source_Obfuscation) before packaging.
don't I have to account for all the different combinations of cell blocks that lead to reproduction while also accounting for where the new block is placed (if it overlaps or goes outside the grid) and also if they become overcrowded. am I not understanding the rules?
More like a functional version of ruby...
Someone else mentioned to pm this because it could be stolen - not just by users but there's web crawlers searching for this type of thing 
Thanks boisei0! Will have a look into Binder! 😊
Thank You! I'll check them out! 
No, you have a good grasp of the rules - it's just that they can be reduced to far fewer instructions than you think. If you're really stuck, one thing you could do is check out Rosetta Code's entry for Conway's Life, where they have implementations for many languages. One version of Life for Python shown there takes advantage of some interesting features in Python for sets (the "boardless approach"). That might be a little advanced for where you're at now, but it ought to demonstrate how these things can be covered by only a few cases.
I have removed the post since it only says "Hi"
We wrote a post to try out a neural network to forecast daily market movements from a set of standard trading indicators. We built a simple model using Tensorflow to create a framework for testing and development, along with some preliminary results and possible improvements.
That’s kinda missing the point. Python is faster but elixir / OTP is much more scalable and fault tolerant (with less code) I use both day to day, all my data wrangling is in python (pandas, numpy, keras, etc) and all my I/O stuff in elixir (web apis, moving data)
Is there a reason you’re using numpy.genfromtext instead of pandas.read_csv
If you’ve never used a functional programming language I really recommend learning elixir. It makes code very easy to reason with, and makes you write better code, with less state and side effects, even when you go back to python. I barely write any classes in python anymore, OOP feels kinda dumb when you get used to immutable state and pattern matching. Plus with elixir as opposed to, say, Scala, you get to write OTP apps which is a very approachable take of the actor model.
I found pandas.read_csv after posting this. Trying it now 
Except python doesn’t have a high performance actor framework built into the language itself (OTP), it doesn’t have pattern matching, function overloading or easy multithreading (if you use the OTP building blocks)
Would you mind linking some of the other courses you would recommend for data science without algorithmic trading?
Been working on a visualization of NOMAD wind data from the National Weather Service. Using the Python package GDAL, I've been processing the wind velocity across the globe and using it to control a particle system (this last part in Processing). A link to my work in progress is here: [https://youtu.be/oPwNqAhUYM4](https://youtu.be/oPwNqAhUYM4) 
Use reas csv is much more robust
You're calling and starting the program in the same "shell". The prompt or window will block for sub process execution. I'm away from a computer right now, but you should check out the ss64 docs for "start".
- Regular Languages / regex - Dynamic dispatch - Builtins - strace - Tuple syntax This is very well written, and great for new Python users. I wish more articles could be this clear and concise. Though experienced Python users can probably skip it. The content should be mostly familiar.
Wait, it's Ruby-like (IMO one of the most unpython languages in existence) and you need to know Erlang anyway? What's the point?
Yeah I'm out on those two principles.
Writing an Api Wrapper for the osu! api in Python
Thanks friend, got it working. 
You don't need to learn Erlang, you need to know how to interop with Erlang that is a different thing. And it is not Ruby like. The syntax somewhat remembers Ruby, however as I put in the post, there is none of the magic, everything is explicit. So syntax may remember Ruby, however as a language design as a whole it is much more Pythonic.
I agree. There are a number of examples where I used `.split`, so I wanted to use `re` to show Python's capabilities.
After a deep dive into Ansible it seems that ansible-cmdb is the answer to my question http://ansible-cmdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/ This seems to be able to extract facts to CSV or SQL files which can be imported in my DB for further processing and correlations
I guess this? https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file There are also spec files for greater specificity. Also conda packages have "recipes" specifying dependencies like any package type. Everytime you install a package though, conda resolves all the dependencies and makes the environment valid, sometimes changing the versions of dozens of other packages for compatibility.
Did this stop the error from happening? I get an incompatibility error from numpy too for seemingly no reason
When would you require multiple inheritance?
Yep, `bytearray` is one type the `+=` would cause problems for. The relevant lines in the code: bytes_types = (bytes, bytearray) # Types acceptable as binary data Later: if not isinstance(s, bytes_types): s = memoryview(s).tobytes() So `s` must be either a `bytes`, a `bytearray` or some other object that supports [the "buffer" protocol](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/buffer.html) (and so can be processed by [`memoryview`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=memoryview#memoryview)). The `bytearray` and some buffer types may be mutable, with in-place modifications happening if they're on the left side of `+=`.
Performing the following in the Python interpreter achieves your desired outcome. I'm not an expert, so there may be a more efficient approach. I hope this helps, and if you require further explanation, please let me know. Code: import re s = "(49) Sat Jun/30 21:00 Uruguay 2-1 (1-0) Portugal @ Fisht Stadium, Sochi (UTC+3)" m = re.search("^(\(\d{2}\)).+:\d{2}\s(\w+).+\((\d)-(\d)\)", s) m.group(0) m.group(1) m.group(2) m.group(3) m.group(4) Output: "(49) Sat Jun/30 21:00 Uruguay 2-1 (1-0)" "(49)" "Uruguay" "1" "0"
Only when you're using a name besides `*args` and `**kwargs`. Usually `def fun(*, foo, bar, bang, quux='hooray')` is a better idea.
no I still get the error RuntimeWarning: numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 96, got 88 return f(*args, **kwds) however the code compiles now and puts out the graphs I wanted it to. The updated code is on my git.
Yea the documentation was the best resource for me to learn python.
FUCK i got this error out of nowhere and now don't know why. I use a requirements.txt for my virtual environment thats like 200 lines long so theres some complication due to that occurring. 
Thank you so much, this makes a lot more sense now
From my very limited understanding, pandas library doesn't play well with data types of &lt;ndarray&gt;, they have to be &lt;DataFrame&gt;. Run your code in console and see what your variables are, are any of them &lt;ndarray&gt;? This thread may be somewhat related to your problem: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9534408/numpy-genfromtxt-produces-array-of-what-looks-like-tuples-not-a-2d-array-why

You may need to use the label "pip3" depending on your OS's version control.
Yeah will have to see what data I can find. The Zillow data for the different types of residences (1 BR, Condo, Single Family, etc) was a little sparse. Will take a look at polygons - thanks for the suggestion!

Lolowut? Where does it say I like `pip`? No, it's a piece of junk. `pipenv`, however, is even worse in terms of code quality. It's a hobby project written by Windows web-developer, who knows very little about infra / system programming and packaging in particular. Among some batshit crazy things this garbage program does: for example, try having a dependency on a wheel, which has the most up-to-date Linux version greater than Windows version. It doesn't matter what is the lowest version you require in your package. Then try installing your package on Windows: not only will it fail, it will fail because it will try to install a non-existent package. It will readily screw its own caches because in order to function it needs three different `pip` installation, which may or may not be of the same version (but most likely, they are different versions), and depending on which one was used last, they may overwrite each other's cache / try using cache, which is in the wrong format for them etc. The funny thing here is your stupid and naive believe that you could do reproducible deployments with Python's packaging system. This, basically, means that you have zero insight into how it works. You probably have red some idiot's blog, which says something to the effect that "pipenv can do reproducible deployment". And now you are trying to accomplish something you don't understand. In principle, there cannot be a reproducible deployment with Python packaging system, because it executes arbitrary Python code during deployment. Code, that isn't under your control. Universal packaging tools don't ensure reproducibility by themselves, but at least, they can give you control over what happens. Which means that, in principle, you could create a process that creates the same Deb / RPM / MSI that does the same thing given the same source code. But, you will have to package all your software yourself, because, like I said, these generic tools and they don't make any promises about what authors of other packages put into installers.
I would start here: https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?q=python%20data%20analytics&amp;src=ukw Also, something to consider is that if you already have strong python skills you may be better suited by just looking for tutorials on numpy, pandas, and matplotlib. Then you can expand to other plotting libraries like bokeh and plotly. Depending upon your math background you would need to apply some statistics and some linear algebra as well potentially. If you are starting from ground zero I would recommend one of those udemy courses to start. 
I think that Elixir is a better language than Python, but I find this article absolutely unconvincing. If anything, it does a disservice to Elixir. The author is confused by terminology they are using. A lot of nomenclature is used in a wrong way, a lot of ridiculous claims are made: something that isn't really right or wrong, simply dysfunctional as a sentence. For example: &gt; In Functional Programming, we don’t have objects so we need to do state transformations. First claim is factually false: there are OCaml, Scala and a bunch of other languages which label themselves "functional", and do have objects. But the biggest "crime" here is the misuse of logical connective: who says we need to do state transformations? Why state transformations? Basically, it's just a word salad. I also find "the Zen of Python" to be too childish to take seriously. I wouldn't build my arguments on top of that.
Thank you for your comment! you are right that the result of what we tried may not be much, and we hope that this can give some people a starting point to actually play around with the neural nets using financial market data!
If you saw the guy who is image processed his finger. Im trying to implement it to play heartstone with just my fingers. 
How is this a solution, if it doesn't solve the problem? Reading PEP-508, I fail to see its relevance. The problem OP is facing is that `pip`, unless explicitly told so, will not resolve dependencies specified by a dependency package, if those dependencies aren't in PyPI. Doesn't matter if the dependency itself isn't in PyPI. This is not solved by PEP-508, not even addressed.
What OS are you on? My recommendation is download the python distribution from Anaconda. It comes pre packaged with pre built binaries. And, addresses all the weirdities you are experiencing.
please please do so!
With PEP 508 and the next pip you can write a setup.py that tells pip to fetch dependencies from PyPI or elsewhere in a well defined way that avoids the messy discrepancies between how setup.py, requirements.txt specify external dependencies and avoids the need for a rare argument. You just can't upload such a package to PyPI. As I also suggested the only user friendly solution, now and with the next pip, is to vendorize any dependency that isn't available in PyPI.
there is " Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython" which was written by Wes Mckinney the person behind pandas
try having a look at the census bureau's data!
Thanks!
Thanks. Will surely look it up.
Thanks for the comment! Answering to your question, yes we did, with a different network, perhaps it was two layer CNN. DL in general is pretty good at approximating those simple mathematic formulae but the point of this post is rather to demonstrate basic code structure and process of how to apply it for the market data in real life (therefore using indicators and so on)
https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor is easier in my opinion
On a purely language to language comparison, elixir doesn't really offer much as a general purpose language. As a functional language, it's not that heavy on the functional concepts (as something like Haskell). The only big selling points IMO, regarding the language itself are pattern matching, and the metaprogrammability using macros/compiler callbacks. The pattern matching is fully embraced as opposed to just defining matchable expressions like in some other languages, as well as bringing this even to binary data, makes for some really interesting and convenient ways for handling control flow and how you structure your algorithms. And because the language gives you access to the AST in a fairly simple way (expressions for manipulating it, as well as the AST structure itself, although it's not quite as simple as a lisp like), it allows for some very power metaprogramming capabilities (building DSLs in the language itself, optimisations, code generation, etc.). However even with those things, for most general purpose tasks it just doesn't really align too well with the task itself (compared to other languages). Sometimes you'll find a problem that can be expressed 1000x better with pattern matching. But for the most part, many general tasks will just not be improved upon enough (and bringing in added effort for building and running the programs) to warrant using elixir for them. Now where elixir really stands out and the reason you'll want to consider it for a certain domain of problems (networking, web applications, distributed applications, embedded programming, etc.) is because of what the Erlang VM (so this isn't actually limited to elixir) provides you out of the box. It provides a VM with very consistent performance (over a long time of usage you'll still have predictable memory usage), designed around dealing with concurrent (lightweight processes, process management, etc.) and distributed applications (talking with other Erlang nodes, fail over, etc.) as opposed to that being an afterthought in most other environments, mature tooling around network based applications (many protocols supported out of the box, drivers can be built for new protocols, tools for inspecting your applications, databases, etc.), and lastly proven design principles or OTP for designing applications with uptime in mind (fault tolerance, monitoring, etc.). Those things are hard to find in another environment, most often instead you'll pick your language, then a framework, then what external tools you may need (to handle distribution, deployment, etc.), etc. to achieve something that resembles that. However then you're often working with a language that is kind of working against you (crashes are usually hard crashes, performance characteristics might not be as predictable especially for other GC languages, etc.). 
Have been gaining an interest in stocks and funds lately. Yesterday had chosen what (26) funds to invest in, put some money there. Thereafter came a small project in Python. The funds have lists of Regions (i.e where in the world they are focused), what Sectors (healthcare, finance etc) and what Stocks (Alphabet, McDonald's etc) in percentages. Made a Python script which broke down all of these into percentages, and, in addition, where the money I've invested has been put. Some examples; - 23.575% in North America, - 7.985% in Healthcare, - 0.027% in Cisco It's partly just for data being neat and for knowing how risks are spread, but started out as wanting to know what company stocks I'm invested in through funds so that that can be taken into account when choosing to invest directly into stocks.
If I'm not mistaken, you are bound to 1 CPU with multiple threads with multiprocessing.dummy.Pool because of GIL. But I guess it's fine for your IO-bound application?
I’m not sure how your environment looks, but when pip isn’t available you can always use python -m easy_install xxxx. It’s the pre pip way to install packages

* Yes. * Practice.
Nice, awesome response. Looks awesome, I'll play around with it in a couple days. Yeah, I don't remember now if I tested blitting on/off once I had the whole set\_data thing sorted out. I definitely had the just indefinite run times on some animations. Like it just forgets that it's finished occasionally and doesn't clean up. Making that whole process easier is awesome. 
I can read and process say 60 times of 3000x3000 raster data within a couple seconds. Drop that into matplotlib animations in the *wrong* way and you'll be waiting sometimes around an hour for a output. Sometimes it'll just never finish. If you jump through hoops and do the set\_data stuff with blitting, you can be done in seconds. 
Oooh I like that.
I guess a related question is "why is that async/await" is the think most people talk about when it's really cumbersome and require quite the gymnastic to work, whereas the `ThreadPool` context is trivial to use in comparison".
Yes, precisely.
True, if you need help with test subjects, hit me up, I have an 11y old daughter that's keen on it :) (she's also into the Harry Potter books). And thanks for using py3, this will reduce complexity for German stuff ;)
I've just published the first usable version of this small extension to hypothesis to generate test cases for CSV-related code. [https://github.com/chobeat/hypothesis-csv](https://github.com/chobeat/hypothesis-csv) Right now I'm working to learn how to put all the bells and whistles to a Python project since this is my first proper public package and I come from the Scala world where things work differently. So far I've wrote some docs and published to Pypi and I'm thinking about some other niceties to add without overengineer too much.
Just have been on Kaggle for the first time. They offer these free courses which promise to provide a fast and compact introduction into Python and Data Science. Sounds too good to be true lol. So are they worth it? How much will I learn there? I'm especially interested in the Python course there atm, cause I wanna learn Python currently. After some research, I've decided to either go with 1 or 2 YouTube vids or with the official docs on the Python website. But this Python course on Kaggle looks promising because it seems to be fast and condensed, especially for people with previous programming experience (which I like cause I'm a bit tired of reading the super basic beginner's stuff again and again when learning a new language). So how is it? But I'm also hugely interested in DS and ML. So very curious about these other Kaggle courses now, too. 
Looking forward to it :)
Thanks!
I m not sure if you mean this but I also tried "Start spider.exe" besides just "spyder.exe" with the same results. Or do you suggest I make 2 batch files one for each command?

I've been working on a researcher/grant recommendation system based on latent semantic analysis combined with text mining. Sklearn has been super handy, so much of the functionality I need is already baked in.
If the only thing you want is to switch the values of the starting point and ending point, you could try something like this: def switch(self): self.starting\_point, self.ending\_point = self.ending\_point, self.starting\_point Could you explain why in your constructor, you are defining local variables starting\_point and ending\_point ? You could use directly in self.length = math.sqrt((self.starting\_point\[0\].... rather than redefining with the same formula the two points.
Good to know.
There is such thing as learning for learnings sake. Wanting to learn more in a subject even if it’s with a blog is perfect for people that simply really like to learn.
I dont think so. If you use map function, it is much more easier.
Because threads are trivial only depending on your problem. If you're just passing a job to a bunch of threads and collecting the results in the end, sure, it's easy. But long running processes, that need to read and update shared state, well, they became a mess really fast. Race conditions slip in, subtle bugs appear, things are really hard to debug. Async might be more complex to understand upfront, but by putting scheduling of concurrent execution back in the application space, it removes a lot of the issues that thread based concurrency has.
Go to python.org and download the installer, then run it.
I disagree with the complaints about the mixing tabs/spaces and the octal change - I think both these are very good things with sound reasons behind them. For the first, I had already long aliased python to `python -tt` to get this behaviour in python2. Having a mix is just asking for trouble if someone edits with a different tabstop setting or something. For the second, there are very good reasons for avoiding a leading zero changing the meaning of a number, because the normal convention outside programming is that they are allowed, but have no effect, and sometimes it may make even sense to have such constants zero-padded in the code. This is particularly the case when reading user input, where you should definitely follow the broader convention (and indeed `int("010")` gives 10 rather than 8), but making it the case that int("&lt;number&gt;") is different from just writing `&lt;number&gt;` is something of a discrepancy in itself. It's something that has caused definite bugs over the years, and is particularly bad in a language like python that is so often used as an introductory and learning language, since it catches out newbies *all the time*. &gt;the strategy has very much been to get the code working under both versions of the language before making the big switch Yeah, I really think the transition would have been a lot better if python had aimed for this usecase, but generally it was pretty hostile to such a polyglot approach. They did come around a bit (eg. accepting the 'u' prefix to strings as a no-op in python 3), but I think things would have gone a lot smoother if they'd planned for this as the migration strategy, since many libraries manifestly *did not* want two independent codebases to maintain
&gt; they're not always the same. That's a good thing
what about the old version 2.7.8? do i need to uninstall that? and which of the 20 installers? 
You can uninstall it through the Apps page in the Settings app. You need the installer for Windows x86_64.
Python 3.7 Win 10 With pycharc
This is something I struggled with for a long while. What finally made it click was viewing them as a way to add code around a function call. For example, say you wanted to have messaging sent to the user so they know when a function starts and ends. def adder(a, b): print("starting") output = a + b print("finished") return output def multiplier(a, b): print("starting") output = a * b print("finished") return output Another way to do that would be to use decorators instead! First we define a decorator that we'll call messenger. def messenger(function): def wrapper(*args, **kwargs): print("starting") output = function(*args, **kwargs) print("ending") return output return wrapper Then we can define the functions above like this instead for the same behaviour. @messenger def adder(a, b): return a + b @messenger def multiplier(a, b): return a * b Basically, if you find that you frequently perform similar actions at the start or end of functions, you can move that code out into a decorator. 
The super function. I seriously struggle at understanding that, even though I've read how it works at least 20 times.
Pretty sure that installing the latest version of Python will uninstall the older version.
I agree, this does seem possible.
By doing that, not only are you forcing every subclass of your class to have the same arguments, you're making it so that any subclass of your class simply cannot also inherit from a third party class with different constructor arguments, which severely limits.
Google for "mixin".
Integrated Zabbix and BMC Remedy ticketing system. I’m by no means a programmer, but I love Python and love Zabbix even more. Basically when we have an incident for very sensitive services it triggers an action calling Remedy via SOAP, opening the ticket with all the alert and server details. Then it returns an API call to Zabbix updating the trigger event with the ticket number. With an ack message. The team gets an acknowledgement email with the incident details and the ticket number. When the problem is solved, it goes around again closing the ticket with the solution applied. Saving lots of time with that.
asyncio is the solution for concurrency. It's not good for compute heavy workloads, sure, but if you're doing compute heavy stuff, you probably shouldn't be doing it in Python to begin with.
I was [thinking the same thing](https://i.imgur.com/NziFII0.jpg)
Like what? You can already do most of the functional stuff in Python, especially if you use modules like toolz.
While this guy's code is certainly worth looking at to see it coded out by hand (and everyone should know how to do it), nowadays you'd just: from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression lm = LinearRegression() lm.fit(X, y) plt.scatter(X, y, color = 'blue') plt.plot(X, lm.predict(X), color = 'red')
concurrent.futures is easily my favourite way to do multithreading and multiprocessing. There are some cases where it would be difficult to use, but for everything I need i have long running (&gt;1 second) functions that I can stick in another thread/process and only wait for them when I absolutely need to.
&gt; I disagree with the complaints about the mixing tabs/spaces and the octal change - I think both these are very good things with sound reasons behind them. Not good enough to waste hundreds of thousands of avoidable work hours all over the world. Developer time is a precious resource and some upstream developers don't seem to care about it at all. &gt; the normal convention outside programming Completely irrelevant to programmers, then. 
For functional programming, native features would be far better than the utilisation of external libraries like toolz. It would avoid compatibility problems etc. 
How come? What sort of compatibility problems? What features would you like to see in the standard library? Or in the syntax itself?
Hello, On Windows \^D doesn't work. Use \^Z and Enter. The arrow keys should work. I'm using CPython 2.7 and 3.5 and WinPython 3.5 and 3.7 and they work on all of them.

You can do that with composition. Why's it better to multiply inherit it instead of compose it?
For mobile, you can look into Kivy. It runs on desktops as well, but it doesn't really feel native on any platform. If you want a well integrated app, it's better to use the technologies native to the platform, so Java/Kotlin on Android and ObjC/Swift on iOS. For desktops, Qt is great and has official Python bindings in PySide2 now.
You're missing the point. it's popular because it sits in a sweetspot that covers a lot of use case. A lot, but not all. Not by a long shot. There are and always will be other languages. You use the right tool for each job. If that is Python, great. If it's something else - also great. Ignore the hype. It's just hype. 
&gt;Not good enough to waste hundreds of thousands of avoidable work hours all over the world I'm pretty sure the balance in terms of wasted time is in the other direction. I've seen way more bugs caused by this than actual usecases where octal was intended, nevermind usecases that would care about this fairly simple to detect and fix change. &gt;Completely irrelevant to programmers, then It's the normal convention for a lot of programmers too, except when they get bitten by this. After all, people don't become programmers instantly, and this is a pretty common gotcha for newbies. Using octal is pretty rare these days - hex is the de facto standard since it neatly divides bytes. The only place octal tends to come up at all is unix file permissions, and there this is irrelevant, because that doens't even use the leading 0 convention.

What's all this, common sense on reddit? :-)
Hey I'm the author, yes I don't have an entire discussion, just the first couple paragraphs have motivated me to try reaching out to my coworkers. So I ended up writing this article. 1. great point! 2. yes, some people do use GitHub as a direct source in lieu of PyPI. I wanted to emphasize the difference between packaging an archive you might put on USB and distributing via someone's (PyPI, Github, etc) server. 3. Environment management is very important and I considered it out of scope but to your point I should have acknowledged this in the article to try to give people some useful search terms 4. That's just, like, your opinion, man.
&gt; I'm pretty sure the balance in terms of wasted time is in the other direction. I find it hard to believe that any programmer puts '0' in front of a number and expects it to be decimal. &gt; It's the normal convention for a lot of programmers too,, because programmers are people Good luck advocating for replacing '==' with '='. &gt; this is a pretty common gotcha for newbies Everything is. It's better to avoid surprising experienced programmers than to cater for newbies who can't be bothered to RTFM. 
It will be extremely difficult to change class variables with your code as there aren't any, there're all instance variables :-)
Yeah it's pedantic as hell to regurgitate `lint` output as critcism. &gt; A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds as some fans of PEP8 might know ;)
&gt; Could you explain why in your constructor, Putting on my pedantic hat `__init__` is not a constructor, it's an initialiser, `__new__` is the constructor.
First of all, I do really appreciate a `mp.dummy.Pool` since many threaded examples can be done as a pool rather than custom writing threads with queues (e.g. a downloader that has multiple connections or a program to spawn off other commands). But do not go blindly replacing a regular `Pool` with a dummy one. You will *not* see performance unless it releases the GIL. As for the other issues, you can get around the pickle issue (which is what I assume you meant by "pickable") for the function. You still need to have your arguments be pickled. See my all-in-one function [`parmap.py`](https://gist.github.com/Jwink3101/494e741f07d33edea47d369bcfc4a54). `parmap` is part a way around pickleing the function and part convenience. The latter adds overhead (including building and closing the pool each time) but is much easier to use. And if that small amount of time is critical, then you should not use this. But, it makes life really easy since you can send it lambdas, etc without a problem

"I think that Python cannot keep growing at this rate at the same time that it goes against these two very important trends." Of the top 10 languages in that survey, not one is a functional language. It seems unlikely that functional features are important to a language's popularity.
Also re: "fooling around". My only real discussion point to contribute is that packaging should be also for people fooling around, newcomers to coding in general. Not just for current, professional software engineers.
Functional features != functional language. Besides, if you're talking about the stackoverflow survey, both F# and Clojure are in the top 10.
&gt;Python 2 did the Right Thing with source files containing both spaces and tabs, for example, while Python 3 throws a fit. This needs some explanation.
They have to keep in in CPython because C extensions rely on it. I.e. pypy could drop it but keep it for c extension compatability. 
So you recommend whether a project deserves a grant based on their summaries or something? Could you eloborate a little more? It sounds interesting!
Unfortunately no. WhatsApp has no formal API, and while there are workarounds out there, they're more trouble than they're worth. Sorry...

Well, obviously, despite glamorous sound of "vendorizing" it doesn't work: no sane person would duplicate their code in a different package simply because the package manager is dysfunctional. But, I still think that you misunderstand / are not aware of the actual problem. *There was no problem with defining dependency links, it works well already*. The problem is that `pip` doesn't trust packages to specify dependencies elsewhere outside PyPI. This is a security problem, not a definition problem. The rational behind decision made by `pip` developers is that they claim that it is not safe to install dependencies of your dependencies because... potato. Well, they think that somehow packages uploaded to pypi.org are safer than packages I download from locally deployed Artifactory. So, what the solution to this problem should be? Really... packages must be signed, and your `pip` should know the keys of people you trust and verify signatures when packages are downloaded. That's the right way to solve this problem. But it will not happen. This is because average Python user is way too dumb to learn how to use keys, how to sign their package, how to add keys to package manager etc. What cold be an OK middle-ground solution: whitelist certain URLs in some `pip` configuration file. Again, average Python user is probably not smart enough to figure out how to use this. What we have now: the all-or-nothing setting. Either you can only download from pypi.org and private repos under the condition that those repos only download from pypi.org, or you can load anything, literally. What the actual solution will end up being? I seriously don't know. But, having been around Python for a while, I think that the way it is today is the best Python can come up with. It will probably eventually become worse by adding some idiotic PEP and a ton of duct tape around this global setting, that will make the "all" part of "all-or-nothing" more difficult.
I know the difference, I want to know why you think accepting code with mixed indentation is the right, and disallowing it is "throwing a fit"?
&gt; I want to know why you think accepting code with mixed indentation is correct, and disallowing it is "throwing a fit" Because paying for the sins of the past is the lesser evil, compared to arbitrarily breaking code that used to work. It's a matter of respecting your users and making their precious time a high priority.
There is some things that I don't like Python, however Python is still my favorite language. The title of the article is not meant to be "You should stop using Python now and use Elixir", it is more that "If you like Python you will probably also like Elixir".
This is a nice article, but I feel like the code doesn't tell the full story here. If the goal of the article is an implementation of linear regression from first principles, then I think you need to go into more detail about where the `m` and `r^2` values come from. Calculating `r^2` is easy for anyone proficient in basic Python, but I think the more difficult part is the underlying intuition about decomposing sources of variation in the data.
&gt; Python 2 made it easy to be lazy and ignore that distinction much of the time; Python 3 requires a constant awareness of which kind of data is being dealt with. I've heard this before, and I honestly don't get it. Py3 doesn't require this "constant awareness"; the type system keeps track of which kind of data is being dealt with. OTOH, Py2 *does* require such constant awareness, as character strings &amp; bytes really are different, but the type system does not track which one you have. What am I missing?
&gt; find it hard to believe that any programmer puts '0' in front of a number and expects it to be decimal. That's not what the change does: it'll give a SyntaxError, not a decimal. But if expecting that is what you meant then why not? Surely you should expect a decent programmer would understand how their language works? You really don't think a single one will read about this? Or not know what to do when their program generates a syntax error on upgrading to a major, incompatible language change? I don't understand why this is something you think newbies should be expected to do, but knowing how their particular language works is too hard for experienced programmers. It's a completely trivial (indeed, irrelevant given the rarity of using octal) thing to adapt to. We lose nothing except a trap people occasionally fall into. &gt;Good luck advocating for replacing '==' with '='. I do think that's not a great convention either (I'd have preferred if the pascal style := won out), but that's *way* too commonly used. But octal literals are incredibly rare. They're a trap with no corresponding benefit versus adding one extra letter to. &gt;It's better to avoid surprising experienced programmers than to cater for newbies who can't be bothered to RTFM. Wait, *newbies* should RTFM, but experienced programmers must be treated with kid gloves to make sure we don't confuse them ny things being slightly different? That seems exactly backwards to me, especially in a language used in teaching.
&gt; I'm ok with you not liking the decision. That is your right. However, it's very unfair to say it's arbitrary. It is arbitrary because there are hundreds of breaking changes that might improve one thing or another. &gt; If you mixed tabs and spaces for indentation (not alignment), that will cause problems if someone else's editor has a different tab width. We care about a program running properly long after being abandoned more than how its source looks in random editors. &gt; Using one or the other (and I don't care which) is more robust than mixing them. Thank you, Captain Obvious, but that's not the point. The past mistake was implementing and documenting a conversion of tabs to 8 spaces before indentation rules are applied. End users should not pay for that mistake. The core developers should pay for it by maintaining it for the foreseeable future.
Both [OCaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml) and [Scala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_\(programming_language\)) are multi-paradigm languages, they are both Functional and Object Oriented. In pure Functional Programming languages there is no concept of object, and [Elixir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir_\(programming_language\)) is more "pure" (it is also a multi-paradigm language, however there is no OO in Elixir). You don't NEED to do state transformations in Elixir also like you don't NEED to use objects in Python. However transforming state by method pipelining and calling methods in objects have similar concepts that you change a state, this is why I put them in the article. &gt; I also find "the Zen of Python" to be too childish to take seriously. I wouldn't build my arguments on top of that. You may think that is childish, I think it is one of the best things to happen in Python: It helps to maintain the language consistent since there is some guidelines on how the language needs to evolve. Also, it shows that the language is made for humans and not computers, exactly because it is a internal joke.
**OCaml** OCaml ( oh-KAM-əl), originally named Objective Caml, is the main implementation of the programming language Caml, created by Xavier Leroy, Jérôme Vouillon, Damien Doligez, Didier Rémy, Ascánder Suárez and others in 1996. A member of the ML language family, OCaml extends the core Caml language with object-oriented programming constructs. OCaml's toolset includes an interactive top-level interpreter, a bytecode compiler, an optimizing native code compiler, a reversible debugger, and a package manager (OPAM). It has a large standard library, making it useful for many of the same applications as Python or Perl, and has robust modular and object-oriented programming constructs that make it applicable for large-scale software engineering. *** **Scala (programming language)** Scala ( SKAH-lah) is a general-purpose programming language providing support for functional programming and a strong static type system. Designed to be concise, many of Scala's design decisions aimed to address criticisms of Java.Scala source code is intended to be compiled to Java bytecode, so that the resulting executable code runs on a Java virtual machine. Scala provides language interoperability with Java, so that libraries written in both languages may be referenced directly in Scala or Java code. Like Java, Scala is object-oriented, and uses a curly-brace syntax reminiscent of the C programming language. *** **Elixir (programming language)** Elixir is a functional, concurrent, general-purpose programming language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM). Elixir builds on top of Erlang and shares the same abstractions for building distributed, fault-tolerant applications. Elixir also provides a productive tooling and an extensible design. The latter is supported by compile-time metaprogramming with macros and polymorphism via protocols.Elixir is used by companies such as E-MetroTel, Pinterest and Moz. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
I don’t think these things will affect python’s growth very much. In terms of usability for functional programming, it irks me that reduce was relegated to a library instead of being a built-in like in python2. The lack of multi-line lambdas can be annoying, but I haven’t seen any proposals that allow it to look anything like other python code. I don’t really get people’s obsession with tail recursion. You’re basically implicitly using the call-stack as a stack for your algorithm. Why not just explicitly use a stack instead?
&gt; Wait, newbies should RTFM, but experienced programmers must be treated with kid gloves to make sure we don't confuse them ny things being slightly different? That seems exactly backwards to me, especially in a language used in teaching. You don't get it. Despite many Python developers being perpetual newbies, Python itself transitioned from some sort of Basic to a general purpose language that is used in production all over the world, sometimes in large codebases. Syntax changes like the octal notation are not hard to understand for experienced programmers, but they are a waste of their time - a waste that's multiplied by the number of programmers and the size of those codebases.
There's no cost for the core developers, there's a cost to python users who have to deal with weird indentation issues.
&gt; There's no cost for the core developers, there's a cost to python users who have to deal with weird indentation issues. I'm afraid I cannot simplify my explanations more than I already had.
My favorite is Jake Vanderplas' Python [Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/). It is free. It is awesome.
Yes because you don't seem to understand that users bear the cost of this kind of bug, bit developers.
And I don't understand why one gets downvoted just by furthering the discussion. 
We have functions as first class objects. We have maps and filters in list and generator expressions, as well as standard library functions. We have lazy evaluation through generators. We have partial application of arguments. Granted there no standard functional composition operator, but it would be pretty easy to write one. What do you want added?
And this isn't a foolish consistency. A foolish consistency is where you prioritise standards compliance over readability, writability, or portability. This is an entirely reasonable consistency. By choosing to expend effort to write non-compliant code, you've made it harder to read, harder to write, and harder to port, for literally no reason. And it's not regurgitating lint output to say that the author's code won't even run because of their bizarre selection of quote characters, em dashes, and so on. Once again, they have expended effort in order to make their tutorial less accessible.
&gt; Yes because you don't seem to understand that users bear the cost of this kind of bug, bit developers. You're really doubling down on the silliness of breaking existing software because some editors might not display the source's indentation properly? Really?
&gt; However, Python still lacks important features for concurrency I invite you to see my multiprocessing library, zproc. https://github.com/pycampers/zproc Also the GIL is considered a good thing by most people. If you want cpu bound multitasking, just use proceses... 
I can't say better. It is not that Elixir is the best language ever. However it is a good language using all the infrastructure that the Erlang VM uses, and this make it to have great tooling.
&gt;I have found out about IPython, which seems to run well even on Windows. Is it better for interactive programming compared to classical Python? Yes, I don't even bother with the regular console anymore.
I also hate that 3/2 == 1.5. It is so exceedingly rare that I want a floating point number instead of integer division.
&gt;but they are a waste of their time Sorry, exactly how many octal literals do you think there are out there? Because I'd be pretty willing to bet it's not many. The time spent having those generate a syntax error, and making a 10 second change to fix them (even assuming this wasn't corrected automatically, as is the case if they're using an upgrade tool), is almost certainly *orders of magnitude* less than is wasted from this biting newbies and others in a single year. &gt;a waste that's multiplied by the number of programmers and the size of those codebases. How does "programmers multiplied by size of codebase" make *any* sense? Do you think every programmer has to fix the same bug individually? The only time is about 30 seconds *per instance of octal notation* in codebases you're upgrading to python 3 - something that is almost certainly pretty small, because this is something that is almost never used. Pretty much the **only** usecase for octal these days is unix file permissions, which is either going to be because you're using a commandline util (in which case this is irrelevant - they don't use a leading 0 either), or something you should be using the appropriate constants for anyway.
&gt; That's not a language feature, it's an implementation detail of cpython, neither jython nor ironpython have it. Python the language is defined by CPython the implementation.
&gt; In a language where indentation has semantic meaning, this is a case of syntax not matching semantics. In other words, a bug. You're confusing interpreter-level syntax processing and editor-level syntax displaying. &gt; And yes, I'm perfectly willing to break a small amount of existing software that relied on a bug, especially when the conversion path is trivial and the new error messages offered, and there existed ways to check compliance. That's why I'm not interested in relying on any of your software. &gt; Yes, preventing buggy, sloppy code, is completely reasonable. Not at the cost of breaking existing code. We obviously have different priorities when it comes to software development.
&gt;I don’t really get people’s obsession with tail recursion. You’re basically implicitly using the call-stack as a stack for your algorithm. Why not just explicitly use a stack instead? If a compiler/interpreter is optimized for tail recursion then a tail recursive function will execute in constant stack space. So you're able to solve problems recursively without incurring the stack cost that you would by using a more straight-forward recursive function (i.e. one that uses the stack more explicitly). 
&gt; EDIT. Okay, one answer to the above question is, "People like living in a happy land where they can write programs that have text-handling bugs without the computer getting all miffed at them." Now, is there an answer that is a bit more charitable? The easy version is "no". The slightly more complex version is that there are domains in the middle where it's not really clear whether you're dealing with opaque bags of data (bytes) or actual text, e.g. when dealing with nominally "text"-based protocols (like HTTP) where this split is ill- or un-specified. IIRC /u/mitsuhiko was one of the people quite annoyed with it IIRC.
The machine learning approach of gradient descent is not efficient compared to matrix algebra as it takes thousands of iterations to arrive at the ideal values. It was only recommended as a way to understand back propagation in the context of linear regression. 
Hi. Great course. I love Z-security courses. Can you share me that course somehow(if you have already bought it). I have financial lack to buy that course, but I really want to pass that course. I hope that you will help. This is my e-mail : awemuminov1@gmail.com
&gt; Good news, my problems are mostly IO bounds. Question: have you looked into using gevent for this?
Honestly, I wanted to try how bad is it. I got laptop from my GF and Win 10 was preinstalled. I am coming from Fedora after 8 years, so I wanted to try it out until my patience won't run out 😊. It's not that bad. I don't understand why there is so much fuzz about it. All new tools are working pretty well. However, I can see that it was much worse.
I was/am annoyed because I do not agree with Python's unicode decisions not because I like messy text handling. (I use Rust a lot these days and it has a superior text handling that's both more practical, faster and more correct.)
You’re right, I miswrote. What i really meant was people’s obsession with recursion. With tail recursion in particular, it never bothered me writing the algorithm in iterative form so it explicitly takes constant space instead of relying on a compiler optimizing for that case.
Bad bot
You can automate buys/sells using the [Robinhood API](https://github.com/Jamonek/Robinhood).
I think (from experience) that threads in IO-bound environment is hell itself (other the way to there on small applications) Using threads means that you want the OS to decide for you what is important and what isn't. The OS is not smart enough for such thing. Also, threads have great overhead (context switch is heavy operation) and race conditions are frequently happens. asyncio is the proper solution to IO operation. At my work we manage to improve performance in x5 (at least) when changed threads with async calls You can see https://youtu.be/9zinZmE3Ogk and https://youtu.be/MCs5OvhV9S4 for more info.
I'm all for removing ambiguity. People don't mysteriously have issues typing hex codes (0xFFFF) so what makes 0o777 any different? Python is used by both newbies and greybeards, and it was even taught in a high school I worked at. I see no problem with making it a bit more friendly and consistent. As for the '==' and '=', PowerShell has this goofy trait that I hate that replaces the '==' with -eq. Not that I agree with doing it that way, but there are odd conventions that could end up in the language if the Python authors choose to do so. 
&gt;You're confusing interpreter-level syntax processing and editor-level syntax displaying. The two are inexorably intertwined. Code is made for human consumption, if code cannot be reliably consumed by humans, *it is broken*. Otherwise, we'd just all switch to asm. Code with mixed &gt;We obviously have different priorities when it comes to software development. Yes, for a language, I'd prefer less surface area for bugs. You appear to prefer a language that lets you write buggy code, I'm not sure why. Like I said, the only places I've ever encountered mixed tabs/spaces, the code was already buggy. I have no qualms about preventing people from running buggy code. Why do you think we should continue letting broken code run, instead of forcing people to address the errors when they upgrade?
I would like to point you towards some lectures by Dr. Marco Lopez de Prado. He goes into extensive details why so many AI trading strategies fail, and what factors go into making a winning strategy. I would advise everyone to listen to some of his lectures.
I see what you mean. To me it seems super intuitive to solve some problems with recursion. But a lot of the simplicity and clarity afforded by the recursive solution is lost if I have to make it tail-recursive, at which point I'm probably just better off writing it in a more explicitly iterative form like you say.
scipy has optimization functions built in. You can use that. Since you mentioned preferences among the classes, you can add more constraints. Such as you want to take more of 2 credit classes than 3 credit ones, b &gt; c. With the given set of constraints, it seems there are quite a few solutions and adding a few more constraints can help.
I agree. Python is popular because it’s “Pythonic” (recursion noted!). Changing what that means to suit other niche areas however popular they may be would ultimately hurt the language. IMO the changes from 2.x to 3 of the language was to bring it even closer to those ideals even at the risk of breaking legacy code. I think the language is better (and more popular) for it.
Interesting. So I tried a similar project during the BTC craze and had similar results: I could train the networks to solve problems with various underlying models (which was great for debugging!) but was never able to make satisfactory progress on asset values like BTC, LTC, ETH and their trade ratios. I came to the conclusion that the markets were essentially unpredictable. I realize that perhaps I didn't make my networks complex enough but even small networks solved the toy problems (with noise added of course). Do you feel the same way or what is your interpretation of your network failing on the market problem but succeeding on toy problems?
Good point, will take a look :)
We have actual experience working with a big market maker in (fiat) currency and deep learning could easily exceed their conventional linear regression model, but it worked well 1) we did very short time frame thus amount of training data was enough, 2) the accuracy is still not like 90% unlike image recognition. Also how to employ the prediction into actual trading strategy is another big story. Anyway long story short, it's not easy but it's also not a fantasy. 
You're describing a web scraper. If you search for the forum software + scraper you'll very likely find something that already exists or requires little modification.
You approach fails because stock market outcome does not depend on the current value of market indicators, but is based on history too. Try LSTM recurrent network fed with a sequence of your indicators to predict the outcome.

Well, I don't like being someone who criticizes without providing useful feedback. Especially on a platform such as Reddit that was built for that purpose. I'd like to send you a PM on this.
Now that the initial hype is out of the way, how serious are you about continuing this project? I was excited for Sanic because it finally used a C-based HTTP parser and was async by design. But there have been so many features added since the last stable release and it's just a bit of a mess. Vibora looks phenomenal and I'm already using it as a front end for a production app. But I'd love to know if it's going to be addressed as a serious project, or if you have enough help/interest in continuing.
Hello :) I'm working hard on Vibora to make a stable release. I'm seeking 100% test coverage, finish pending implementations and split some pieces of this project into new projects to make it usable outside of the web-world. (template engine and schemas for example) I aiming to have it ready in early September, hope I can match the expectations :) I appreciate your comment, many thanks!
No idea, but I hope someone answers
&gt; I find it hard to believe that any programmer puts '0' in front of a number and expects it to be decimal. You must live a sheltered life. I see it on a roughly quarterly base, aka. when I start porting the next project from SCO to Linux. 
I think just 'buy' or 'sell' is a good start. I had made it into a game so that the net was trained to play the market like a game, and the score was the profit. However, in a real market you get very large sudden swings that tended to wash out any apparent short term profits. Beating a linear regression model is good, but certainly doesn't mean that the model produces profitable results. If the market is predictable, you should be able to profit off that predictability.
As near as I can tell Pythonista supports split screen and pane multitasking. It doesn’t look to me like the Udemy app does though. https://imgur.com/a/pzaCPTu/ 
Because `concurrent.futures` is better. 
Thank you my friend!!!
Note this caveat: &gt; At this time, the original App Engine-only APIs are not available in Second Generation runtimes, including Python 3.7. This means that if you already have a significant app running on Appengine Standard, none of the built-in APIs are supported (memcache, images, search, task queues, email, etc). 
It's also based on almost everything that's happening in the world
&gt;With the implementation of the suggested improvements, it is certainly possible to improve on the model to the point where it could be used as a complimentary trading indicator to a standard rule based strategy. Looking forward to the blog post where this doesn't work either
&gt; Suddenly I understand the vote weight RES show for you. Those are your own votes, you silly muppet ;-)
FYI, := is coming in Python 3.8 (PEP 572) :)
Thank you for the very valuable feedback. Yes, indeed the framework is not yet as feature-rich as Zato (a project I wasn't aware of and I find it super interesting). **Comparison with Nameko**: The Proxy client (Nameko's core feature) is already added in the current development version: `client = HttpClientServiceProxy('http://127.0.0.1:5000/')` `client.reservations.post(Reservation(order_id=order.id, products=order.products))` While in case of Nameko you can expose A resource (a.k.a callable endpoint) by using the @rpc decorator, in case of Appkernel you have multiples options: * Extending the Model and Repository classes and all CRUD related methods are automatically expose. Additionally you can use the @link decorator to expose additional methods as resource endpoints. * Extending the Controller class and using the @resource decorator, giving you fine grained control over the methods (resource endpoints) you intend to expose; Also Nameko already features AMQP and Websocket communication which is not yet implemented in appkernel (it is on the roadmap though). **Comparison with Zato**: Zato has a slightly different target, namely to build an ESB... Appkernel is more about providing a very very simple, cloud native framework which enables you to develop micro-services super quickly, without fuss and big overhead. At the expense of a steeper learning curve Zato still offers much more functionality at this point of time.
You won’t learn if someone else does it for you. Also ——&gt; r/learnpython 
Covering Perl and Ruby makes sense, as they play in the same field. In the case of Matlab and R also makes sense, as on one side a easy and dynamic language is a good candidate for prototyping and exploring, and in the other is a matter of libraries and FFI. Taking over Go and Java in performance is a very different topic. I do not think that, after so many attempts, Python will have no GIL and / or a competent JIT (outside Pypy). The async history is not perfect, as is splitting the codebase, but is there for the developers that want to use it. Also FP is a bit out of scope. Python can include better lambdas and better ideas from FP, but will be never a competition for FP, as mutability is part of the core of the language.
Actually, I'm not a fan of that at all. It's not coming in the sense I meant here (ie. being **the** syntax for assignment), but simply as an alternative to allow inline assignment. I don't really like having multiple syntaxes for it - if assignment was simply made into an expression, that'd be one thing, but this seems the worst of both worlds: all the issues of allowing it, but without the conceptual (and syntactic) simplicity of just having one way to do it. I don't think it really adds enough value to justify that. 
I was reminded why I have downvoted you numerous ttimes. As demonstrated here, you are so full of yourself that your comments are nonsense that doesn't bear any resemblance to the parent comment.
Thanks! I've already got the part written that opens the correct directory and can "see" the files. And it's coming back with no errors. Now I need to write the part that opens those "seen" files and saves as one .txt file. Thanks for the tip! I'll get something rough together and post over there!! 
As somas says, Pythonista does but Udemy doesn't. You might want to try out Udemy in Safari (or your browser of choice) to see how well that works (if at all, I haven't tried it).
That's fine and I agree, ...hell I've even thought about throwing my lot in in automated trading (and still might), but before anyone trades a dollar they should understand conceptually about efficient markets, market vs idiosyncratic risk, stock beta, market micro structure, etc. You really need to understand you are trying to beat something that fundamentally doesn't want to be beaten in a market that is cutthroat and designed to take your money if you make a mistake.
A key question is what you mean by "combine all files". If we are talking a basic concatenation, the task as you describe is very simple, in fact you don't need Python to do it, just some basic bash. However, if you mean to combine the *data* in the files by, say, making sure that all column headers are aligned between the files, then it takes a bit more effort, and Python would indeed be a good tool, where libraries like [csv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) would be helpful. You already hinted as using the [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) library, which has the helpful method *listdir*, which will enable you to gather files from an OS path. You may also wish to learn about how to access command-line arguments in a Python script, see [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_command_line_arguments.htm). But otherwise I agree with your intuition that this isn't that hard of a task, and the libraries above combined with some gentle file handling and maybe rudimentary string manipulation, should do the trick.

How's this vs. AWS? The one horror story of that employee who triggered Google to shut down his entire company's services with Google comes to mind...
The whole point of this post is about using a simpler API. gevent is great, but when a thread pool of reasonable size will do, it isn't work learning a different approach.
Don't. Upgrade to python 3.7 ;) 
`import os` `import csv` `dir_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))` `for root,dirs,files in os.walk(dir_path):` `for file in files:` `if file.endswith(".csv"):` `f = open(file, 'r')` `text = open('new_file.txt', 'a+')` `for row in f:` `text.write(row)` `f.close()` `text.close()`
I wholeheartedly agree with you. multiprocessing.dummy used to be my goto tool for attacking embarrassingly parallel problems. But now more often than not I will use ThreadPoolExecutor from the concurrent.futures module which has mostly the same interface but less prone to deadlocking.
The thing is both categorizations are bullshit. Object-oriented means nothing, and functional means nothing. But, let's pretend that they do mean something, then, still, there are so many references in the literature to something as "functional", and at the same time, perhaps in a different context, as "object-oriented", that really, one would get an impression that two epithets describe different qualities of whatever's been discussed. Perhaps orthogonal to each other. So, to say &gt; because X is functional, we don't have objects (a property of OO) is, simply either a misunderstanding of terminology, or a mistake. State transformation is a very general concept. But, in this context, nobody can really tell what you mean when you use it. So, it is, again, just a misuse of nomenclature / poor understanding of the subject matter. &gt; I think it is one of the best things to happen in Python: It helps to maintain the language consistent since there is some guidelines on how the language needs to evolve. Dear lord :) All of that "zen of Python" is just poorly concealed demagogy. None of that really means anything. It doesn't help doing anything about the language. It's just a bunch of nonsense phrases. Kind of like a usual drivel you get when you watch political debates on TV etc. 
Basically the data is written into .csv files. But is often sharded into anywhere between 1-20 separate files. I'm going to "dumb it down" (not calling you dumb at all, just making sure I'm explaining correctly) and explain the current process and maybe that will help with you and other understand my use case. Basically I have a server that outputs data as .CSV. let's say in this case it sharded into 5 separate files. I open file 1 and scroll to the bottom (all files are just 1 column) I open file 2 and copy, then paste at the bottom of file 1, then close file 2 I open file 3 and copy, then paste at the bottom of file 1, then close file 3 I open file 4 and copy, then paste at the bottom of file 1, then close file 4 I open file 5 and copy, then paste at the bottom if file 1, then close file 5. Next, now that all of the information is in one file I "save as" a .txt file and I am done. It's really not hard or difficult at all but when things can be sharded up to 45ish timesnit gets time consuming. Again, no idea why my coworker never thought of a better way to do this. So my idea is to take all the .CSV files and place into a folder, let's call it Midway Station. Then have a script open all .CSV files in Midway Station, perform the above process of combining files, and finally save as a .txt file. Does that help at all?? Thanks!!! :) 
Cool! Looking forward to it!
I actually have pandas installed. Very new to trying to use python to automate dumb easy stuff. But I do have that library installed. I just need to sit down and learn it's functions. Thanks for the tip!!
This can be done with bash. But let's stick with Python. So the outline would be: (1) List all files in a given directory with os.listdir (2) Loop over this list, optionally after sorting the list by filename. (3) In the loop, if a given filename ends with ".csv", then fin=open(name) (4) Read the entire content, data=fin.read() (5) Append this content to a list that was initialized as empty prior to the loop (6) After all looping is done, merge the content into one giant string, say '\n'.join(the_list). (7) Write this giant string to a new file. You may have to polish the string, say if you have a lot of empty newlines at the bottom etc. And there may be tweaks needed for your particular circumstance. You may have to consider how to pass to the script the information about which directory to list in (1), but using sys.argv will be a basic way for that. Good luck.
If you're just concatenating the files: $ cat * &gt; ../newfile.txt You do not need python for this. What OS are you running?
Awesome!! Thanks for the help. I appreciate it. Seems like I'm on the right track. I'll post an update once I've got it all working nice and smooth!! :)
I'll look into "cat" thanks a ton!!

Okay, I'll help. But yes, r/learnpython for the future. This problem, like many programming problems, is about breaking larger tasks into smaller ones. So, how can you break down this one? 1. How do I get the text? 2. How do I count the number of words in the text? 3. What even is a word? 4. How do I count things in general in Python? 5. How do I share the answer? 6. How do I know if someone wants other information as well? Pick any part, solve it, and move on. Before you know it, you'll have an idea of how to fit the parts together! 
Not much to `cat`. It just dumps the contents of one or more files to the screen. Short example of using it for your case: $ cat ex1.csv cellA1,cellA2 $ cat ex2.csv cellB1,cellB2 $ cat *.csv cellA1,cellA2 cellB1,cellB2 $ cat *.csv &gt; combined.csv $ cat combined.csv cellA1,cellA2 cellB1,cellB2 
Interesting. I'll play around with it. Once I find a method that works and gets the job done I am going to fiddle and try and find out which way gets it done the quickest.
Heh, yea. Guido wasn’t a fan of this syntax either at first, but then he was and everyone else wasn’t... so he quit. To Python beginners, this is bound to get confusing, too, as there’s now =, == and :=...
You can use powershell for this: Get-childitem -File -Filter "*.csv" | Get-content | out-file output.txt

You should probably just put the full path to the image in your script.
I wouldn't go mixing named and unnamed arguments adhoc, it may be confusing to someone who's new to Python. Either stick to one, or the other, or explain why you switch between the two when you do, otherwise it just looks messy and without purpose (especially when using named arguments).
Where i work ik create gui with pyqt en then package them with pyinstaller into a nice exe. I make my team store the exe's on their desktops. They do not even need to know how to run python scripts or even install the interpretor...
Now I'm getting a unicode error.
To search for several you could just do the search multiple times.
Ow, I will try this. Does it work well when including libraries (sql, pandas, etc ...) ? Any precautions to take ? Thanks !
If you're saavy, or your IT team will work with you, a WebApp is always appreciated by non-technical people. I like using my Caddy Web Server with the Python scripts done as CGI scripts. Then you can make a web form, have them input the data, submit it to the script as CGI, then you output whatever way you want.
Are you regerring to pyinstaller? Not familiar with sql or pandas library. Opencv, pillow, Matplotlib and sqlite however seemed to work just fine :)
&gt; Does it work well when including libraries (sql, pandas, etc ...) ? Yes, there's a `--onefile` flag to give `pyinstaller` to indicate you want everything packaged up. Keep in mind this makes the final executable a lot larger.
Post your code and the exact error message.
import PIL from PIL import Image newpic=Image.open("C:\Users\car\Pictures\bg.png") (unicode error)'unicodeescape' codec can't decode bytes in position 2-3: truncated \UXXXXXXXX escape 
Yeah, I think too. My idea was for them to input a csv, and it would use the info in the file and output either other csv files or html files. So the process of uploading data seems quite troublesome.
Maybe in small companies, in larger companies however there are lots of rules and policies to follow. You cant just get a server set up on your demand and you dont just set up a rouge server. If i would do that kind of shit i would be fired as soon as the server gets identified by the ITdept. A pineapple almost cost me a job already, should not have named its ssid anonymous
Thank you so much for your help, it works great now!
The question to really answer is will future versions become more bloated? or will they become more restricted, worrying about ridiculous things (e.g., types) that have enabled it to be easily adopted?
There was also one or two new developers who pushed the issue so hard that I'm looking forward to the next Raymond Hettinger talk on the development process. 
1. On line 41 of your README.md: &gt; So you add something like `assert isinstance(value, int)` You probably shouldn't use this `assert` example. My understanding is that you shouldn't use `assert` for flow control, because you can actually turn it off at run time using a flag, like `python -O yourprogramname`, which will bypass your assert statement and execute the code which the statement protects. Make it a standard conditional statement instead. 2. `@type_checked_call_skip` and `@type_checked_call_convert` Maybe consider making this `@type_checked_call(skip=True, convert=True)`. It's fine either way, but to me, these are more like a parameter than unique functions. It also lets you easily do both `convert` and `skip`, but you may be able to do that anyway with: @type_checked_call_skip @type_checked_call_convert def test(x: int) -&gt; int: return x You may want to test and see if this works actually, and update the README.md with this example if so. If it doesn't, I'm sure you could make it work with a small change. 3. Inheriting from `NamedTuple` I think that you should try to make it so that this is not necessary. You could either that by providing your own base class that is already inherits from `NamedTuple` and also adds the functionality of the type checking *without the decorator*. Otherwise, you could try to dynamically recreate the decorated class object to inherit from NamedTuple by using something like `type(YourObject.__name__, (NamedTuple,), {})` within the scope of your decorator function, if it is a class object. 4. More Features So *if* you do the dynamic object constructor thing above with `type()`, you now also have tremendous flexibility with adding other features to the object, and could potentially make the decorators do other fancy stuff, just by adding attributes and methods within the `{}` namespace provided in the `type()` calls signature. I'm thinking something along the lines of "Let the user pass functions whose names correspond to the names of the parameters so that they can customize the exact behavior if they want it to do something *before* throwing an exception. For example, say you have some `fruits` in a complex dict: import csv import undictify fruits = { 'apples_yellow': [4, 3, 2], 'apples_red': [2, 3, 11], 'lemons': 19, 'oranges': 2 } def fruit_sum(fruits): for quantity in fruits.values(): # Detect if quantity is some kind of iterable container. if hasattr(quantity, '__iter__'): quantity = sum(quantity) return quantity def fruit_combine(fruits): prefixes = [key.split('_')[0] for key in fruits.keys() if '_' in key] # ['apples', 'apples'] keys_to_combine = [key for key in fruits.keys() if prefixes.count(key.split('_') &gt; 1] # ['apples_yellow', ['apples_red'] combined_fruits = {} for fruit_name, fruit_qty in fruits.items(): if fruit_name in keys_to_combine: new_fruit_name = fruit_name.split('_')[0] # 'apples' combined_fruits[new_fruit_name] += fruit_qty else: combined_fruits[new_fruit_name] = fruit_qty return combined_fruits @process(fruit_sum, fruit_combine) @type_checked_call(skip=True, convert=True, process=True) def fruit_writer(**fruits: int) -&gt; dict: with open('fruits.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile: csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile, delimiter=',') csvwriter.writerow('Fruit Inventory') for key, value in fruits.items(): csvwriter.writerow([key, value]) In the above example, I added a `process` decorator to our `fruit_writer()` function to add some optional handling of the values. `fruit_sum` is a simple example acting only on the value, and `fruit_combine` is a more complex example which works across multiple items in the dict. Note that both functions take the whole dict `fruits` as the only argument, and return an updated version of the dict. With some awkward effort, it could probably be further refined to prevent the user from needing to loop through the data structure themselves, and to filter which keys to apply the processing two in the decorator call signature. That could get quite complicated to implement, but it's definitely possible. Just keep refining it until you feel you have made the clearest possible abstraction for the user, with the minimal amount of memorization required, and with the minimal amount of input required so long as it remains clear. 5. I think the name `type_checked_call` is unnecessarily verbose. I think `check_types` is a little nicer, but that's just my opinion obviously. 6. Name 'Undictify' keeps making me think of "Undignified". How about "Dictnity", so it can restore dignity to your dict unpacking in call signatures. :P Undictify is fine. I'm mostly joking. Unless you like my suggestion. :P
&gt; from . import mydamnmodule Ugh. I understand that Python 3 is trying to make cleaner code by this, but changes like this bother me. Part of the charm of python is that it has been readily accessible, and bugs like this aren't as game changing as introducing bugs and preventing ease of us in innumerable libraries that have been developed. 
I can't even begin to recount the number of bugs I've had to fix in Python 2 code where division was accidentally truncated. 
I've been aware of Wikidata for some time, but it was frankly a little intimidating. Seeing these examples in Python really helps!
And most importantly it is driven by human emotion. Good luck predicting that...
I would love to help in the development of this....
Google? Humans? Good luck unless you are a huge customer or have loud fanbase.

Thanks for all the help guys, I have it successfully "seeing", opening and combining all files, then saving it as a .txt. now I'm running into a unicode encode error. I think I have a piece of code that I can use to make it open each file as a utf-8, and I think that will work out for me. Let me know if you have any other ideas guys!! Thanks !!
Sure
Hey SeanPackham, just checked it and gotta say it's really useful, I recently moved to a new city and it's really helping me to check the surroundings. I though noticed that some of the suggestions in the DRINK section were bar that were already "permanently closed" once checked on gmaps. As these are results you don't really wanna see in a list of things to do/visit, is there a way your search engine to check that before showing the results, and maybe erase them from the list?
I used pandas nearly every day. You can use pd.read_csv() to open the CSV files and pass a column header etc. if you wish. Then it’s as easy as appending each of those resulting dataframes to a list, then calling pd.concat(the_list, axis=0) to append each of them together. I do agree with others though that you can use cat for this as well, and if I were to do it, I I would probably go for that approach.

regexes are often much easier if you can visualize the matches. I find regex101 a great place to get the expression where I want it, then it provides code for different languages. https://regex101.com/r/dMEzLo/2/ 
As someone else said, the latest [Plotly](https://medium.com/@plotlygraphs/introducing-plotly-py-3-0-0-7bb1333f69c6) release has exactly what you want. It's a fantastic plotting library. 
If you want quick and dirty, just read in from the environment. See `os.env`, `os.getenv`, et al.
I actually think in this case, it's better behaviour. In general I agree with you, but writing 1.0 * a/b is worse than a/b. And using the double slash to ensure integer division is still visually concise
The numpy function will generate an array in memory, no?
There is one on pypi called keyring which works rather well for local storage.
I think that in this case it's the PHP way, "lets make it simple, people want '1' + '2' to be 3". A programmer would most likely prefer for operations to not change types if not needed. There is more to it than just floats, what about decimals? How do I divide two integers and get a decimal in python? The answer is that I can't but for some reason getting a float is reasonable. To me that's just bad design.
Can you install Python on their systems? If so... Toss a GUI onto the front-end of your utilities and then let users double-click the .py file. It'll launch straight into a GUI. Try PySimpleGUI to get up and running in a few minutes to see what it feels like to use your programs with a GUI. It's worth the 5 minutes it'll take. pip install PySimpleGUI Docs [http://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/](http://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/) GitHub [https://github.com/MikeTheWatchGuy/PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/MikeTheWatchGuy/PySimpleGUI)
It's basically the flexible environment with easy deployment and scaling. It's not even close to the current standard environment with all it's excellent built in APIs and services. I hope they are able to get it closer to the type of product that the Standard environment represents.
Made a script for friends at work that will automatically clock them in and out :)
Fair point, I suppose '1' + '2' should never be 3, but we're also in danger of slippery slope fallacies by arguing they're similar. Floats and integers are much more tightly linked, under the umbrella of numerics (you can add them in Python, but you can't add a float and a string - Python is a strongly typed language) than strings and ints/floats are and returning a float instead of an integer still allows for sensible numeric computation. Also when you consider a large number of python programmers aren't computer scientists, doing the mathematically expected 1/2=0.5 makes more sense than 1/2=0. I mean, I still make that mistake on occasion since I expect mathematical sense. Python has always been about being intuitive and sensible and allowing one to write clear and concise code without allowing you to make too many mistakes. At the end of the day, if I can do 1+1.5=2.5 and 1.0/2=0.5 I don't see why 1/2=0.5 is so objectionable. In all these situations there is implicit promotion of ints to floats, and division is an operation that makes sense to always return a floating point type.
1 + 1.5 has to be cast to either int or float and in that case it makes sense to cast it to float(or raise an exception). Traditionally integer division returns an integer in the majority of programming languages and that is what programmers are used to, to return a float from integer division is just weird and doesn't make sense. Floats and integers are not remotely the same and we all know that. Floats depends not only on IEEEEEEEEE but also on the hardware you use, integers does not. I consider python changing integer division to blauurgh-division to be a very bad idea, along with f-strings(which are already misunderstood by so many) and utf8 as the one-and-only string encoding.
What kind of apps can you make with this? Is it like GUI stuff ? 
The example shown is a linear relationship but generally you are looking at more complicated situations in the real-world. It depends how many dimensions your problems has, and how many parameters you have, and how easy it is to linearize your equations. For simpler stuff, matrix algebra is fine. For complicated equations often you have to use a minimization of error algorithm. L-BFGS tends to be the fastest approach, if we are talking about `scipy.optimize`. Another big issue in real-world data is you end up with oscillations in the error function, so finding the global minima is a bit of a pain. The basin-hopping algorithm tends to be the standard here.

I'm starting to learn more about python, generally through the process of making a discord bot. But I've gotten to the point where I don't want to use idle anymore, because it's a bit basic. Any recommendations for IDEs?
&gt; When determining the object type... One of the biggest points when teaching python is duck typing: don’t check the type, just assume it has the functions / attributes you need. (One occasional exception is string types, since they behave like a list of characters in situations when you want to treat them as a value)

Yes, for writing simple scripts. But the last major step in programming (after making it work, making it readable, making it safe, and making it extendable) is making it work fast. Python's friendly duck typing is a major performance setback and a good programmer will know how to counter act this. 
I feel like many of these suggestions are really ugly... I suppose I should test and verify they are actually faster...
Check out r/learnpython
I’ve seen this before but I’m unclear if this is supported by Robinhood. Does this actually work? (Sorry if dumb question. I’m new to coding / Python)
Not sure how adding `isinstance` calls will make anything faster, especially considering that in Python, a try-catch statement that doesn’t catch anything is quite fast. I’m curios when you’ve found duck typing to be “a major performance setback”. Also, this is Python: it’s not fast (interpreted languages aren’t, as a rule). After you’ve made it work (with some unit tests to verify!), the next step is to profile and find the bottleneck. You can then replace that bottleneck with some compiled code using Cython or pybind11 (or numba, numpy, or some other tool). That’s assuming the script is long-lived enough and slow enough to warrant such attention, of course. Regardless, you’ll see significantly better results with that approach compared to scouring for these micro-optimizations. There is value to keeping best practice in mind when you’re writing the code the first time, though.
Before you lecture me you might want to take time to actually appreciate the details of the situation yourself. The change is that pip 18.1 *will* allow install of packages that specify external dependencies (for packages that don't originate from PyPI). The way it does this is more user-friendly. It eliminates the command line argument `--process-dependency-links`, `dependency_links` argument from `setup.py::setup()` and unifies the setup.py/reqs.txt syntax. All of which were clumsy and inconsistent kludges. This is an improvement to the package manager for anyone who uses *private libraries*. However, PyPI will not allow packages that depend on external links to be uploaded to it, indeed because potato. More precisely, because security theatre. And no, vendorizing is hardly glamorous – apart from some justified exceptions, every instance is a failure of the ecosystem.
Adding isinstance wont make things faster. Using isinstance /instead of/ the other methods will. If you really need to do type checking. For whatever reason may arise. Otherwise duck typing is your friend.
It doesn't work. sublime 3 announce: "No build system"
Hopefully they will be adding back at least some of the integrations. If you look at the other std runtimes (except for nodejs which is also new) they do all have a user api. Seems like the priority was getting the bare bones flex environment to run under gvisor, now on to features...
A lot of this is not what I consider good advice. The only thing here that I do with any regularity is the use of generators instead of iterators. And that's not a huge speed boost anyway, it's primarily a memory efficient thing and can have unintended side effects like consuming in a log statement. The dict thing just makes for more readable code when applicable. The iteration thing is harder to do and is only a thing done by newbies to python. The rest, like import into local namespace, I'm sure is just a trivial speedup. The from import is not a recommended thing in general at the top level. This doesn't even mention using comprehensions over loops. This is an all round terrible article and will result in minor speedups at best, and less readable code in general.
Habits? Tricks to slightly help with performance if necessary maybe, but if you make habits of most of these you're simply sacrificing readability. 
The problem with using type instead of instanceof is not speed, it’s correctness. instanceof will still work if somebody subclasses list, for example, and passes your function an instance of that. Using type will break that.

No! 1. Be Pythonic. 2. Be correct. 3. Profile if still necessary. 4. Address any bottlenecks found. 
I could send you a pretty cool calculator I made if you want :D
I see a few issues with the article... * &gt; lengthy module variables can be replaced with short identifiers to improve readability Nope... short identifiers with name `ls` don't increase readability. `ls` stands for lineSeparator... which is much less readable. * One should avoid using `isinstance` or `type` if possible. * List comprehension vs generator expression I am not sure if generator expressions are actually faster (needs testing). I wonder if there is an extra function call associated with the generation of each item. Sure, I can see that list comprehensions create a list, which takes up time and space to create, but I am not sure its slower. Lets test it out. &gt; %timeit sum([x*x for x in range(40000)]) 3.57 ms ± 128 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)` &gt; %timeit sum(x*x for x in range(40000)) 4.2 ms ± 73.7 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each) As expected, the generator is slower by about 20%. * `eval` and `exec` should be avoided if possible. * &gt; will be executed when the module is being imported (Whether it's really necessary to be executed or not) The "Whether it's really necessary to be executed or not" does not make sense. It is necessary to execute top level code in modules... that is how module import is defined. * Point 7 about `main()`, `__name__` and `__main__` is very poorly made, and very painful to read. An example would have done it much better. 
Yes.
What's the difference between this and scrapy?
Where have you seen that "from x import y" is not recommended at the top level? I don't really care for this article, but I have seen the from ... import as _the_ way to do things if you only need one class or member, such as `from pathlib import Path` which is sufficient for 99% of my use-case of pathlib
If we do not want to change your logic and want to use zip, then something like this i think will help you: from itertools import zip_longest # lets assume that price is always shortest and we need to fill with 0 # or you can use None list(zip_longest(prodname, price, description, img, fillvalue=0))
&gt; Using isinstance /instead of/ the other methods will. why? how? using try/except if used a lot, i give you that. however, if _most of the time_ the type is as expected, adding a check is definitely costing more cpu cycles _every time_, than just trying and if the type was wrong (in the _minority of cases_) handling the problem in the except. also: use type annotations.
The Wikipedia article on Composition over inheritance has a reasonable summary of the [drawbacks of composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance#Drawbacks). Basically, mixins are a way to implement the composition *pattern* without having to write all that extra code.

Hmm, this is a holdover from my old company actually, I'm not sure how much weight it holds and was also particular to the code org there. I think the main reason is that namespace shadowing is still a thing and easy to muck up, especially when a lot of company modules had similar names to existing libraries/standard libraries.
You are so right, specially when you say something like "The search speed of mappings (such as dict, etc.) is much faster than conditional statements (such as if, etc.). And there is no select-case statement in" Those are strong words, without benchmark, we will see people all over the world replace all their condition by dict lookups :D 
And those 5 are: 1. TensorFlow 2. NumPy 3. SciPy 4. Pandas 5. Matplotlib
Is your time example python 2 or 3?

In my opinion PyQt/Pyside is the most best and extensive GUI framework for Python. I have built several relatively large and complex desktop applications with it and have found it easy to use. Also the Qt company has started officially supporting Python so you dont have to abide by PyQt's GPL license. Your familiarity with C++ will help out as Qt's C++ documentation is excellent. You just have to translate it to Python which isn't difficult, it is pretty much a one to one binding between C++ and Python.
I am currently making a microblog API project with Python and Flask. Something like Twitter. I want to discover how the projects are structured, how REST is executed in Flask/Python, how to build something from the ground up, how to write stuff the Python way. I'll also add some simple user authentication and some basic search capabilities too. It's a little simple but it will also be my first Python project so I'm excited to see how it turns out. 
So if you want to be a Python programmer, you have to be a C programmer too. Got it.

For me, using dicts instead of conditionals is ugly, and not pythonic - as it obscures the fact that conditions are being tested. 
Why use beautiful soup? Scrapy would be a better option
BeautifulSoup is a parsing library while scrapy is a web-spider or in other words Scrapy is a framework whilst BS is a library. With BS you can get the content from certain parts with less efforts and will only provide the content of the URL that you gave and then it will stop. While in Scrapy you could add constraints and add a list of URL or give a URL root to start crawling. 
Thank you.
Yes, Scrapy is a better option than BS but I was just starting out so I tried to use a library then to use a framework. 
What is "MQT Engine"?

[There is quite a big list of changes here](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/python-differences#wzxhzdk22changes_to_the_app_engine_standard_environmentwzxhzdk23). I'm guessing most of them wont ever get re-added (task queues, users, memcache, mail?) in favour of third party services or newer Google services like Cloud Storage/Queue. Interesting that they're discouraging the use of dev_appserver as well.
I’ll send it if you want! I did it last year and you just enter the equation normally and make it as long as you want! :D
Thank you so much again for another great review! &gt;You probably shouldn't use this `assert` example. You are right, so I [changed](https://github.com/Dobiasd/undictify/commit/558227c0f45c2c6a328d176f2a1b96c3f56c0fd9) this. &gt;`@type_checked_call(skip=True, convert=True)` Currently if you want to have both, you don't need to do this: @type_checked_call_skip @type_checked_call_convert because there is `@type_checked_call_skip_convert` too. However I agree that the version with the parameters might be cleaner &gt;I think that you should try to make it so that this (inheriting from `NamedTuple`) is not necessary. Actually it isn't necessary. I only use it do not having to write out the constructor (the only things that counts) of the class manually. But it works with normal classes with a custom `__init__` or with `@dataclass` too. Just [added a remark regarding this](https://github.com/Dobiasd/undictify/commit/b2ae0cdf37a025a796a62c1fa6779c72c809d82d) to the `README.md`. &gt;4. More Features Maybe add some tools for additional processing of data. OK, I have to think about that one for some time. Currently I'm not sure if I believe it fits into this library or is a different concern that should be separated. &gt;I think the name type\_checked\_call is unnecessarily verbose. I think check\_types is a little nicer, but that's just my opinion obviously. Mhh, yeah: * verb: `check_types` * adjective: `type_checked` * noun: `type_checked_call` I'm not sure. But I agree that good naming is important. &gt;6. Name 'Undictify' keeps making me think of "Undignified". How about "Dictnity", so it can restore dignity to your dict unpacking in call signatures. :P You are right, currently it sounds a bit like "undignified". :D I like your word play, but for my taste "Dictnity" is a bit hard to say/remember.
&gt; zproc It looks nice. I will try it soon
Really good recommendation! Never picked up QT with c++ but knew it existed. The fact that I can avoid the GPL license is nice too(even though open-source is a main part of my learning) I will check it out and see if it is for me! :) Thanks!
Please send it. Sound fun! :)
According to the Google support page, you get a TAM with platinum support: https://cloud.google.com/support/ I haven't used it, but it sounds like what you'd want if you're going to lose thousands per minute on production being down
Cool
Habits ? Hell no ! Writing non idiomatic code to get a bit of speed is premature optimization in any language. But in Python, it's just the total opposite of the language philosophy. So yes, iterate directly and not with index. But no, don't alias stuff just to get a local reference. Only optimize if you have identified a bottleneck you \_\_need\_\_ to get rid of.
Great to hear! Feel free to ask if you have any questions
Let me know how it goes or if you have any problems. Interested in getting feedback on how to package is working for you.
I will :)
I think that depends on your definitions of bother "efficient" and "robust". If you want to check to see how fast tkinter is or how the widgets look and operate, you can easily do this with a package named PySimpleGUI. It wraps tkinter in a way that makes creating a tkinter GUI a trivial exercise. In 5 minutes you can be trying out your GUI. PySimpleGUI is very lightweight (it's a single .py file with no dependencies). Works on all flavors of Python3 including the Raspberry Pi.
&gt; Test code can be written in the main() function of the module. I thought it was best practice to have tests in a separate module?
So this is my first time hearing of the basin hopping algorithm after several years of learning statistics. When you say it's the standard algorithm, what are you basing that on?
Agreed, but &gt; Explicit is better than implicit. and you can (usually? often?) have both, by flattening conditional clauses. Eg rather than if x: if y: do_something() can use if not x: break if y: do_something() I think I heard this referred to as 'guard clauses'
Hmm, a matter of taste maybe but I find being explicit is worth the extra lines of code.
You're right, most of the suggestions are not ugly and are the normal or pythonic way to do it. I was thinking of the first and second points. Especially the first point.. I really hate it when people use short non-descriptive local variables to refer to things imported from libraries. Perhaps I'm more jaded than usual though, having looked at a lot of data science code lately.
Shameless self-promotion: if you're looking for an ndb-like library for Python 3.7, check out [anom](https://anom.defn.io/).
The file looks to not be encoded in utf8. Does the package support python 3.7?
I found a package called discord.aio, but I'm not sure if it's developed enough, or if it's just visual studio that's not developed enough lol. What are you planning to do with your bot?
&gt; Traditionally integer division returns an integer in the majority of programming languages and that is what programmers are used to, to return a float from integer division is just weird and doesn't make sense. this is the stockholm syndrome speaking. Just because it's traditionally done like that doesn't mean it's the word of god. Traditionally people are used to using windows OS, using linux is just weird and doesn't make sense. The difference between other languages and python is the level of abstraction. Python is on a much higher level than most of them and its goal is to shield the user from the vast majority of low level details to provide greater convenience and flexibility. These other languages also have strict types and strict function signatures, on the other hand in python you can write def div(a, b): # is expected to work with any compatible numbers return a/b given that such a function is expected to work with any combination of "numbers", getting floor division in some cases but true division in others is arguably more ugly than the alternative. Python's paradigm of how types work is simply significantly different and it leads to different outcomes as far as what consitutes "sensible" is concerned. 
You have a flat line, so it converted to scientific notation to better fill the axes. Set the y limits manually.
Not at all. I typically write large GUIs, one in particular has been in development for 6 years. Back then, it was in wxPython. PyQt/PySide with their signal/slot system allows for a far more logical system (and fewer bugs). Combine that with a lot of stuff being done for you with great defaults and I'm quite happy. Tk works, but I find it cumbersome and kinda ugly.
you aren't using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)? It's the most well established in python and one of the most used overall. Join us either at [The official help discord server](https://discord.gg/r3sSKJJ), on the [Python discord Server]( https://discord.gg/8NWhsvT) or on the [Discord API discord Server](https://discord.gg/discord-api) I'm doing a small queueing bot for fights in a play by post dnd server!
Does the wiki apply to Python, because Python is duck typed? Hettinger's talk was nice. However is demonstrates how to use multiple inheritance, but not why. If you're interested in further reading or talks, there a very appropriate design pattern heavily used inside gamedev and almost unknown outside of it, called ["Entity-component design"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93component%E2%80%93system) which is designed to allow behavior to be changed at runtime.
Looks like PyQt/PySide is my way to go!
**Entity–component–system** Entity–component–system (ECS) is an architectural pattern that is mostly used in game development. An ECS follows the composition over inheritance principle that allows greater flexibility in defining entities where every object in a game's scene is an entity (e.g. enemies, bullets, vehicles, etc.). Every Entity consists of one or more components which add additional behavior or functionality. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Third party packages. PyAnsys, pyNastran, and others are pretty capable. Linking up to a machine learning code would be easy.
Funny story, I just tried to do this today! I was running Pythonista app and Udemy in Safari side by side. Everything was going great until my Udemy course presented me with it’s online python editor for a quiz. The Udemy editor in Safari is garbage and was a deal breaker for me. I use a Bluetooth keyboard and the arrow keys do not function in the safari editor. If your course doesn’t heavily use the in browser editor then maybe you’ll be fine?
&gt;Set the y limits manually. Awesome, should of thought of that. Thank you!
Why should people avoid using isinstance? How else would one do dynamic dispatching?
No. Many of the IDEs out there have provision for scripting them.
I started to learn web scraping using BS and haven't tried selenium or Scrapy so I don't know much about those. After some toying around with BS I am thinking to try Scrapy. And you should know one thing that BS is a library and it won't provide you that many features which are provided by a web scraping framework like Scrapy. I don't have any knowledge about selenium, if you know any nice blogs or articles please leave a comment. 
'Sloth3.gif' est un fichier binaire et il a été packagé comme un fichier texte, du coup quand python essaye de le lire, ça plante.
But what if some context on the website can only be got when the user is logged. Does this library offer solution in this case?
I sat down for 30 days and built a pretty cool Music Player with Tkinter. 15 mins of coding everyday. I also teach how to make it in this YouTube Playlist - [Python GUI Programming using Tkinter + Pygame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECKA1Ojp_E0&amp;list=PLhTjy8cBISEp6lNKUO3iwbB1DKAkRwutl)
No! I have already mentioned in the blog that there is a thin gray line between collecting information and stealing information. There are many other ways to collect data from social media like Facebook's Graph API and there are many python libraries available to scrap tweets from Twitter. 
English?
I think selenium lets you interact with javascript (pressing buttons, filling forms etc.) As far as I know, beautiful soup just formats HTML in a readable way and lets you easily parse the element tree to get info from specific elements. I haven't figured out how to do anything with BS that you can't do with simple string matching or regex, but I am pretty new to BS too so take that with a grain of salt.
Selenium is generally overkill and only really needs to be used if the page is Javascript heavy.
Nice. I was thinking about doing the benchmarks, but then I thought, "Wait, I could just complain about it on reddt," so I did that instead.
It's for Python 2. Google translate isn't hard to use, by the way.
No problem, it’s looking good already. Take what you like, leave what you don’t. There is a reason these aren’t PRs. I’ve been reflecting on similar subject matter and have been thinking about teaching programming lately, so providing this feedback has been practice for me. 
user() doesn't know about the user_input variable. you should be using "givenstring" everywhere that you've put user_input in user() function
I could see AI applications in laying out efficient structures and trusses, maybe some form of least energy/work. I have some structural stuff on my github if your interested: [https://github.com/buddyd16/Structural-Engineering](https://github.com/buddyd16/Structural-Engineering)
Stfu you stinky bastard 
Cool content! I have some constructive criticism about your code quality: * You are importing libraries that are never used * PIL.Image * urllib.parse.urlparse * urllib.parse.urlsplit * Shortened names are less clear, harder to read, and harder to keep in your head. * BS -&gt; BeautifulSoup * pd -&gt; pandas * ex -&gt; extracted_content * df -&gt; data_frame * Ambiguous names give no context, and a hard to differentiate between each other * website_page, page, webpage_2, openwebpage_2 * title_links, _title, only_title, title * soup, soup2 * A, B, C * There is no control flow. Use of function definitions and calls can increase readability and re-usability * At two points you use urlopen and BeautifulSoup together, this should be functional * Extracting the content from the url is a functional block * Converting the extracted content to a CSV file is a functional block * Your misusing range and len in your for loop. You could use a special function to give you both an iterator and an index, but you don't really need to, as the index is only used to force a dictionary into a list * Your misusing dictionaries. The keys in links are sequential numbers starting at 0. This is a perfect use for a list * You lines that reference a variable and do no action. These are programming errors, maybe you meant to print them? * The only comments in the code base, are used to remove what looks like debugging prints. This fine temporarily, but needs to be addressed before submitting to production (Or in this case to an article) * I have a suspicion based on your notes and code excerpts that the code shown is not the exact code you're breaking down [Here is a pastebin](https://pastebin.com/ws57VVdG) where I've modified the code to try to fix the issues. I'm not sure if it's without errors, as I didn't bother running it. 
Just out of curiosity, I tried installing this, and, indeed the package archive contains a GIF file in the scripts list. This is weird and unexpected for setuptools, but it definitely shouldn't cause an installation failure. BTW. this has nothing to do with Python 2 vs Python 3. Just a bug in setuptools brought to light by a strange package. If you simply download the tar.gz of the package, edit it by removing `Sloth3.gif` from the `setup.py` scripts list, you will be able to install it. Not sure if it will work though.
Check out r/learnpython
User() doesn't know about the user_input variable. I think you've misunderstood the point of a default parameter by the way. You use them when the function might be passed an argument or might not. In your case, there's no need for givenstring to be an input so you could just define it in the user function. Your code should look like this: def user(user_input): error_string="Too Short" while True: word = "1234567890" if user_input == "quit": break elif len(user_input) &lt; len(word): return error_string elif len(user_input) &gt;= len(word): return user_input else: print("Check your input") def main(): user_input = input("Write something (quit ends): ") user(user_input) if __name__ == "__main__": main()
'user\_input' is a local variable in main(), which means as long as you don't define it in 'user()' , the function does not know it. You could just add it to user as a parameter and it should work. 'def user(user\_input, givenstring = "Too short"):' ' user(user\_input)'
it uses BS ?
&gt;whats is a class variable?
So, let me get this straight. To setup Python 3.7 and PyCharm on a Mac, you download the installers, and run them. Then you tell PyCharm to use Python 3. So glad someone told me how.
If you plan to spend a lot of time developing in Python, PyCharm may be a good option. Since I'm only doing a couple Python side-projects, Atom works well.
I agree with this so much! Optimize for maintainability and readability first, performance second -- unless your requirements explicitly and measurably say otherwise. Only then you should optimize for performance using load tests, flame graphs and other profiling tools. If performance is a high priority, one strategy is to implement that part in a lower level language. Create a separate service or a callable library.
 Good and informative article 
I've been using Arsenic for my web scraping as it gives me async capabilities with the webdrivers and lets me speed up sifiting through hundreds of webpages but it isn't very well documented and I always find myself just hacking it together. Does anyone know of any decent packages that allow me to asyncronously request website data with the asyncio event loop? I've not looked at aiohttp properly but would this be better?
Thank you so glad it is useful! At the moment I combine a bunch of results from different APIs and sometimes the odd place has closed down. We want to add a feature to flag outdated results or even submit fixes. What do you think?
It is situational..
Thanks man. I try your code but it doesnt run as i expected. I think if i could pass the user input as a parameter to the subfunction, it should work.
everyone who uses pandas seriously abbreviates pandas as pd and dataframe as df.
The code I've given you (and the code you gave me) only returns the strings rather than print them. So if you want to see what the code actually does you'll need to print the string the function returns. The code I gave you has the user input passed to the subfunction.
Cool thanks!
I've tried BS4 and a little bit of scrapy before, but I must say I'm a fan of [`requests-html`](https://html.python-requests.org/) myself. It's basically BS4 plus the ability to parse javascript rendered contents, which is the one negative I had for BS4. That said, I find the javascript rendering doesn't always work on first try, sometimes it can take multiple rendering (not request) attempts to parse the details I wanted.

The more pythonic way is to do duck typing, so you don't actually look at the type at all but just try to do whatever you want to do with it. A good example of this is the python builtin `sum(iterable)`. It doesn't care what type of iterable you give it (list, tuple, generator, …), it'll just try to iterate over it anyways. It doesn't even care about what the iterable yields, it'll just blindly add everything together and give you the result. If it gets something that can't be added, it'll just throw an exception.

You right. It did work on jupyter notebook but didnt work on the coompiler i wanna use it for. It gave this error - program terminated prematurely. 
Thanks bud for pointing out the mistakes next time I will take care of these. And for the PIL, I have mentioned that if you want to get images from a website you can use PIL. But I haven't used in this code. Sorry my bad. 
So anyone can write on Medium? This is /r/learnpython at best. 
It all starts here: [https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html)
Sorry, I wasnt saying factually that it is faster, or that there arent better ways, but that was the point the author was making.
Glad to hear, good luck fixing the rest! Change/Google stuff until you figure it out. Learning to debug yourself is one of the best programming skills you can learn.
You should be using a lookup table (a dict) and a for loop instead. It could probably save you more than 3/4 of your lines of code. i.e.: `morse = {'A': '. -', 'B', '- . . .', .... }` `for letter, morse_value in morse.items():` `print(morse_value, '|', letter, '\n')`
I would ignore what they said about Pandas as pd and dataframe as df. Them's pretty standard
i've never seen pandas NOT imported as pd and rarely see a dataframe not called something like data\_frame\_content\_df
I love you
I love you both

That's actually one of the tools I've been using to make my visualizations! Unfortunately, our machines don't have access to the internet so I couldn't even use the API for it if I'm not mistaken. Would probably go for Matplotlib &amp; do custom if I was doing that. 
Definitely! I have seen numerous examples of lists where dicts would be more appropriate for the use case.
I believe you could be a very good teacher. :)
Creating a script using Openpyxl and several other modules to make an automated estimate sheet for bidding on electrical projects. I haven't touched python in over a year, but this is making me relearn this language pretty quickly
This looks REALLY promising! Thanks for the tip! Will investigate it soon.
I highly recommend using Requests-HTML https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests-html
Ah! I've seen that recommended elsewhere as well but had forgotten about it. I'd have to build something custom but yeah that would probably make more sense than matplotlib. 
I had not! I just heard about airflow a few days ago. I'll look into them for sure, thanks for the tip!
You would have a login (program, or webpage) that accepts a token. That token is generated by your Authenticator. Create an Authenticator that will generate unique and random codes for the users every so often. Fairly simple.
Even without benchmarks dict lookups are constant time while elif chains are linear jn number of conditions so for large enough chains dicts should be faster
&gt; check to see how fast tkinter is Spolier: it isn't ;-) So much input lag in the widgets as you add more content into them. Might be ok for simple stuff, will not be suitable for implementing a text editor.
Yea, a text editor **seems** like tkinter would struggle to do. But, then again, I've not tried. 
it is.
Sure, duck typing is fine, but depending on how complex the dispatch is it may just be simpler to use `isinstance`.
&gt; for mobile/IOT platforms or even small little desktop tools. For Pi based stuff and small utilities for the desktop, I certainly recommend PySimpleGUI. I just posted a demo program that acts as a launcher. Push button access to all your scripts. You can call them directly or launch them as a subprocess as I did. Here's the GUI [https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/43910497-f9890e64-9bca-11e8-9992-598d12baaa04.jpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/43910497-f9890e64-9bca-11e8-9992-598d12baaa04.jpg) And this is the code for it... the GUI &amp; launcher together... import PySimpleGUI as sg import subprocess def Launcher(): form = sg.FlexForm('Script launcher') layout = [ [sg.Text('Script output....', size=(40, 1))], [sg.Output(size=(88, 20))], [sg.ReadFormButton('script1'), sg.ReadFormButton('script2'), sg.SimpleButton('EXIT')], [sg.Text('Manual command', size=(15,1)), sg.InputText(focus=True), sg.ReadFormButton('Run', bind_return_key=True)] ] form.Layout(layout) # ---===--- Loop taking in user input and using it to query HowDoI --- # while True: (button, value) = form.Read() if button == 'EXIT' or button is None: break # exit button clicked if button == 'script1': ExecuteCommandSubprocess('pip','list') elif button == 'script2': ExecuteCommandSubprocess('python', '--version') elif button == 'Run': ExecuteCommandSubprocess(value[0]) # send string without carriage return on end def ExecuteCommandSubprocess(command, *args): try: sp = subprocess.Popen([command,*args], shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE) out, err = sp.communicate() if out: print(out.decode("utf-8")) if err: print(err.decode("utf-8")) except: pass if __name__ == '__main__': Launcher() 
On list comprehensions vs. generator expressions: My opinion is that you should always use generator expressions, even when they're slower, unless you have a specific reason not to. Issues that occur with generator expressions (e.g. exhaustion before use) are far more likely to show up during testing than the sort of issues that occur with lists (e.g. turns out the list has a billion items in it). Good Python is often not about speed, but rather easy to understand, maintainable code. Often, 90%+ of your program doesn't need to be fast. The rest, well you might want to do hacky things to make it faster, but if you need speed that badly, you should also consider if doing it in Python is the best way to go.

BeautifulSoup more or less got me my job, so +1
That's quite easy in python at the majority of cases. At first utilize the cProfile for "high-level" profiling. And if you are stuck and don't understand the odds at low-level, get the line_profiler.

Learning GUI development with PyQT5.
thanks man nice solution 
Just created a little GUI to try out what an editor would feel like. I opened a 16 MB text file and it was very responsive. I don't have menus and such so more overhead would be there for a final version. You will need the LATEST version of PySimpleGUI for this example. The Update method isn't available for the Multi-line element in the PyPI version. Get the single [PySimpleGUI.py](https://PySimpleGUI.py) file from GitHub and you'll be good to go. import PySimpleGUI as sg def Editor(): form = sg.FlexForm('Editor') multiline_element = sg.Multiline(size=(100, 30)) layout = [ [sg.Text('Editing Filename', size=(12,1)), sg.In(key='filename'), sg.FileBrowse(), sg.ReadFormButton('Open')], [multiline_element], [sg.ReadFormButton('Save'), sg.ReadFormButton('Exit')], ] form.Layout(layout) # ---===--- Loop taking in user input --- # while True: (button, values) = form.Read() if button == 'Exit' or button is None: break # exit button clicked if button == 'Open': try: file_contents = open(values['filename']).read() multiline_element.Update(file_contents) except: pass if __name__ == '__main__': Editor() 
We are thinking about putting some other methods of DL applying to trading but focus is always the method not performance. Give us your suggestions of what type of failure you want to see :)
It might be quick if it's worse than notepad ;)
Seems like you put a good amount of effort into it already. I think it's the right approach to use profit as reward and apply something similar to reinforcement learning. Also you are completely right that predictability isn't necessarily connected to profitability, but higher prediction accuracy gives us more chances for profit.
You might remember emotional retail trading volume is never dominant in the market and especially recent market corrections were driven by hard stop limit with algos in institutions.
scrapy is for when your servers get blocked and selenium js when html is generated by javascript after page load. so yea everything has a function and should be learnt.

Stupid question: is there a way to make beautiful soup open up an actual browser and run through the code like you can on selenium? This is really helpful to me when debugging since I am following more trial and error rather than actually knowing what I'm doing. Also: thank you for uploading this, it's going to help out a lot. I'm just beginning with python and HTML parsing. I know C++ and some VBA, but have never done anything with HTML. 
The highlighting function of mplcursor seems to be exactly what I am looking for, is there an example of mplcursor being implemented with tkinter?
"For items in list", switch statement and a print statement. 
&gt;switch statement You realize this is Python, right?
Then it would be better if you tried coming up with a solution yourself first. Creative thinking is very important in programming.
Some sort of dictionary approach, mapping “#” to .5 and etc
So, just to be safe, is A# == Bb == 1.5? And I assume that if A is 1, then a is 0.5? I would use a regular input to get a String like you described: &gt; Then when you input a list of letters/notes like "B C a D# c A" Then, I would use the String method split(). That one return a list of words in a String. So, if you have a string "B C a D# c A", you would return ["B", "C", "a", "D#", "c", "A"]. Another useful method you could used is the String method find(). You pass it a character (not sure if it works with substrings, probably does) and it returns the index of the character in the string. a = "string" a.find(s) ## returns 0 Using strings with the alphabet contained in them will help you. Make one of uppercase characters and one of lowercase characters because they have a different value. The string methods upper() and lower() could also be useful for you. They switch the case of the whole string. 
It drives me absolutely wild that python developers have common name shortening. It really does increase the learning curve. I will refuse to use those shorter names for the rest of my old grumpy days!
oeos, I have been programming in C for too long. You are right!! Then I would suggest something like list compare. compare = A B C D E F G for i in notes for j in range(1,len(compare) ) if j == compare\[j\]: print j 
1. Nobody uses globals 2. Nobody writes while loops like that anyway, and even if they did, factoring away some len calls would give negligible performance benefit in any non-trivial program. 3. Readability counts, and a KeyError will ruin that already ugly snippit. For cases where the likelyhood of matching is higher, a try/except is faster than an if, if you care that much about insignificant performance gains. 4. Everyone does this anyway, and again this is not a real performance bottleneck in any program. 5. List comps aren't really faster for the computation. They just aren't lazy like generator comps so you pay the whole cost upfront. They also are not interchangeable. You cannot slice or index a generator normally. 6. eval() and exec(). No. 7. The last one isn't really a performance point, but rather an application safety point. Bad list tbh.
I was aware of that, but I think the logic that's used in the dict and the logic that's used in if/else is kind of the same and the entire point was comparing the cost. So taking the cost of creating the logical structure in memory into the calculation in one case and not the other would not be fair. Maybe it's just a bad example, but that too, imo is on the author of the blog post and not on me.
The dict and loop worked well. I ended up with a list comprehension in the function so it returns a list def convert_text_to_morse(text): codekey = {"A":".-","B":"-...","C":"-.-.","D":"-..","E":".","F":"..-.","G":"--.","H":"....", "I":"..","J":".---","K":"-.-","L":".-..","M":"--","N":"-.","O":"---","P":".--.","Q":"--.-", "R":".-.","S":"...","T":"-","U":"..-","V":"...-","W":".--","X":"-..-","Y":"-.--","Z":"--..", "0":"-----","1":".----","2":"..---","3":"...--","4":"....-","5":".....","6":"-....","7":"--...","8":"---..","9":"----.","Ä":".-.-","Á":".--.-","Å":".--.-","Ch":"----","É":"..-..","Ñ":"--.--","Ö":"---.","Ü":"..--"," ": "", ".":".-.-.-",",":"--..--",":":"---...","?":"..--..",",":".----.","-":"-....-","/":"-..-.","(":"-.--.-",")":"-.--.-",'"':".-..-.","@":".--.-.","=":"-...-"} return [codekey[t] for t in text.upper()]
The point of duck typing is to completely avoid making a dispatch based on type - that means you don't have to use ininstance because you don't want to know the type in first place.
appreciate that
&gt;You lines that reference a variable and do no action. These are programming errors, maybe you meant to print them? Jupyter notebook would treat these lines as print(var) &gt;There is no control flow I'd treat this as an exploratory analysis (i.e. what these Jupyter notebooks are for). We can assume that OP would clean/refractor this code in a more functional/Pythonic way if it was meant for reuse. Not that anyone should encourage bad programming habits! But I'd give these notebooks a little more leeway. 
That's a fair point. I will adapt the code and posts.
Need to build a durable crawler with rotating ip addresses. The larger the pool, the better. 
Yeah but BeautifulSoup is just so easy to use. If I want a list of all divs with the class "product-box," it's as simple as... product_list = soup.findAll('div', {'class': 'product-box'}) Maybe each of those divs has a link in it, and I want a list of each url... url_list = [p.find('a')['href'] for p in product_list] You could definitely do that with string manipulation or regex, but would it be nearly as elegant and easy to read?
I liked your video. I wanted to do something like that for a project my daughter worked on. Thanks for the push. 
Basin hopping is sort-of a more evolved form of simulated annealing.
If the arrays are standard lists, this will work. df = pd.DataFrame({"a":[1,2,3], "b":[3,4,5], "c": [4,5,6]}) df a b c 0 1 3 4 1 2 4 5 2 3 5 6 
If I understand correctly, you can just use pd.DataFrame.from_dict(d, orient='index') Question might've been better suited for r/learnpython though 
Perfectly functional, thanks.

'A' and 'a' are the same note. Some people use lower-case letters to signify a minor-key harmony, but for pure single-note harmonies, it is the same root note.
What nonsense are you on about? If my bird has a method "make one of potential noises", and I have 10 different bird species as subclasses, each with 1 or 2 different noises, your code will be a giagntic mess of try/catch or a very messy getattr. On the other hand, you can just do a if/eilif branch or a dict switch, which will be more readable than the try catch and more performant than a getattr. If python didn't have type safety, and say, like javascript returned undefined on any unknown attribute access, then fine. But it doesn't do that, it has attribute-based type safety.
Music, huh? I only know the basics of basics and am completely tone deaf. I think I get it though.
A lookup table is a much better way to do it, as /u/HyperbolicInvective suggested. I also suggest using a generator to produce the morse code, and decouple printing from translation. Here's something i scratched together: morse_code = { 'E': '.', 'T': '-', 'I': '. .', 'A': '. -', 'N': '- .', 'M': '- -', 'S': '. . .', 'U': '. . -', 'R': '. - .', 'W': '. - -', 'D': '- . .', 'K': '- . -', 'G': '- - .', 'O': '- - -', 'H': '. . . .', 'V': '. . . -', 'F': '. . - .', 'L': '. - . .', 'P': '. - - .', 'J': '. - - -', 'B': '- . . .', 'X': '- . . -', 'C': '- . - .', 'Y': '- . - -', 'Z': '- - . .', 'Q': '- - . -', '5': '. . . . .', '4': '. . . . -', '3': '. . . - -', '2': '. . - - -', '1': '. - - - -', '6': '- . . . .', '7': '- - . . .', '8': '- - - . .', '9': '- - - - .', '0': '- - - - -' } def str_to_mc( txt ): emitted = False for c in txt: if emitted and c != ' ': yield from ' ' if c == ' ': yield from ' ' else: yield from morse_code[c] emitted = True if __name__ == '__main__': print( ''.join(str_to_mc( 'I LIKE TURTLES' )) ) For funsies I also wrote a snippet to generate the morse code instead of just plopping a static table in. I don't think this is good design, but it was a fun tiny problem to solve, nonetheless: def gen_mc_table( alphabet, starting_code='.', initial_table=None, skip_key='\0' ): value = int( '1' + ''.join( '1' if a == '-' else '0' for a in starting_code ), 2 ) table = initial_table if initial_table is not None else {} for c in alphabet: if c != skip_key: table[c] = ' '.join( '-' if a == '1' else '.' for a in bin(value)[3:] ) value += 1 return table def make_intl_mc_table(): alphabet = 'ETIANMSURWDKGOHVF\0L\0PJBXCYZQ' numbers = '54\0003\000\000\0002\000\000\000\000\000\000\00016\000\000\000\000\000\000\0007\000\000\0008\00090' return gen_mc_table( numbers, starting_code='.....', initial_table=gen_mc_table(alphabet) ) It doesn't work for the non-standard symbol codes, but whatever. Since I've decoupled the generation of the codes from presentation, I can do other cool things... like fire up pyglet and generate tones instead of text... if __name__ == '__main__': time_span = 0.1 player = pyglet.media.Player() for d in str_to_mc( 'SOS' ): if d == ' ': player.queue(pyglet.media.procedural.Silence(time_span)) if d == '.': player.queue(pyglet.media.procedural.Sine(time_span)) if d == '-': player.queue(pyglet.media.procedural.Sine(time_span * 3)) player.play() @player.event def on_player_eos(): pyglet.app.exit() pyglet.app.run() If something is worth doing, it's worth doing to death :) Yes, I was bored.

Always thought it weird that reddit doesn't allow the "three-backticks" style of formatting a block. 
rpc is not a replacement for rest. they solve different problems
Constant time can still be constantly slower than linear time for small 'n'. Benchmarks are required.
&gt; You're recreating the dict every time there Yes, and the OP is creating a dict just to get around a chained `if`. No reuse of the dict is noted in his blog.
my code only expects the bird to have a `.make_noise()` method. What it will do is up to you, I don't care. I don't even care if it is a bird or not! I'm just calling `.make_noise()` in the object you're passing me, and that is all I need to do with your bird as part of my function. If your bird doesn't have `.make_noise()` python will raise `AttributeError` and I will let it propagate to your code, because you're the one that didn't pass an object able to make noise in first place. I don't need any `try/except` in my function, if you don't know whether your bird (or plane or car) can make a noise or not it is your problem, not my library/function's problem.
Someone will dust off JSON RPC at some point, for the exact reasons you're describing. Most likely it will be Gen Z programmers who will take a look at all the cruft involved with "correct" REST APIs and say, "your libraries suck old man, we're going to build the new hotness!" 
AFAIR, triple backticks is not part of the original markdown and was introduced by github.
I still like `doctest` for library and/or utility functions.
It should absolutely be added if not to the 'official' spec than at least to reddit. Having to shove four spaces between everything is a huge PITA when writing code samples.
Ugh, Reddit keeps switching between the new and old editor on me. Will fix the OP.
Shit, I'm a Gen X programmer, so I'm old enough to remember when REST was the new hotness. I just never really liked it. ;) I'd use JSON-RPC, but, dates.
Reddit does single backtick not triple, but In my opinion they could revamp a lot of the grammer its a bit fucky, especially with superscripts and nested parenthesis. `my monospaced code example here`
Thanks, Reddit's new editor really did me in. OP's been fixed.
IIRC, CRUD is more or less *exactly* what REST is intended for. Otherwise it wouldn't be clever. They took the old webdav/HTTP verbs, which are CRUD (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, etc) and grafted JSON on for serialization. What's left is CRUD. When you want non-CRUD items is when REST APIs get weird. Like sending an email. Most APIs just make the endpoint a verb itself, like `/email/send`. RPC is broader, but in real business applications, they solve the same problem, and most REST APIs have something resembling a procedure call for anything non-CRUD.
You missed the first line being included in the code sample.
Do you happen to know how airflow generates graph picture?
Yeah, I often paste into Vim and add the spaces there just because it's easier :P
Great tutorial. Thank you! 
I do agree with you on many of your points. My comment was restricted to the performance aspects of comprehension vs generator expressions. &gt; The rest, well you might want to do hacky things to make it faster, but if you need speed that badly, you should also consider if doing it in Python is the best way to go. I liked the way you put this. I hate people who dismissively say "hurr... if you care about perf, you are using the wrong language.". People use Python because they love using it and its easy to get a project off the ground. Lots of students use Python for work that is critical to them. Imagine you are a student trying to implement a game using pygame (or doing some other school project)... and happen to have unoptimized python code, the game/project will run unacceptably slow - but you will only properly notice this when you are close to the project completion. In a big org, one might think about starting afresh by using some other solution... but for a student on a deadline who has already sunk a few weeks into the project - they can hardly shift the project to another language. They don't have an option and they need a quick and sometimes dirty solution to squeeze out some performance. But whenever someone come to these forums with ... how can I speed up my code, they hear... "durr... you made a mistake in choosing python" - that is hardly helpful to such students. We should stop saying this... because its really useless. I don't think anyone has the time to reimplement their project in some other language. All they will do is not pick python if they have an inkling that it will lead to performance problems later on. There are lots of things people can do to speed up python code... I have myself used a lot of good and some hacky methods in my career to squeeze out 3x to 10x performance gains - which was usually enough for the task I was looking at.
Yep, me too. The road we've travelled is littered with distributed computing tech: RPC Java RMI CORBA XMLRPC SOAP REST And don't let that other yahoo fool you, CRUD on an object is a subset of RPC, not an entirely different class of distributed computing. 
What kind of remote operation doesn't fall under CRUD? Isn't that a model for all operations?
Thanks. :) You forgot DCOM in there.
&gt; What kind of remote operation doesn't fall under CRUD? Any operation that isn't a create, retrieve, update, or delete operation. So for example, a state change operation. An authentication operation. A delivery operation. An aggregation. Suppose for example that you built a server-side four function calculator. Add, subtract, multiply, and divide are not CRUD operations.
No it hasn't. You still have only 3 spaces for the first 2 lines of code. 
Good eye. At this point I'll pay you or anyone else to post for me.
Pretty interesting, I've never really read up on centroids before. It's kind of crazy that you are opening each file and iterating through the contents every single time you calculate the centroid for a word, though. You should cache that or something. I know this is a demo but seeing that kind of drives me crazy :)
Sadly, there is no such thing as the official markdown spec. It's mostly defined by the various implementations, and the implementations usually vary quite a bit. For example, many implementation either doesn't support * stuff * like * this or is inconsistent with the number of spaces required to indent.
“Your pussy has blown up.” You made me choke on my water as wasn’t expecting that! Hilarious 
If you can read the language a post is in, most try to write in that language. Or at least say what language it is in. Some texts google translate can misinterpret for a different language.
You can also surround it with triple backticks
There is a CommonMark group/spec, which reddit is a part of.
I thought it did?
&gt; Having to shove four spaces between everything is a huge PITA when writing code samples. I typically use a good code editor that can do block intents. Select all, add an extra level of indents there, then copy and paste here.
Its the "IPython" project, rebranded as Jupyter a couple years ago (to be more inclusive to R and Julia). It lets you execute code line-by-line and print its output (especially charts or statistics) in a pretty html wrapper, and save it all in-line with the code, exactly as executed. Its a really tidy format for explaining code and exploring data sets. You'd probably recognize it from the docs for packages like sk-learn/pandas/statsmodels. 
Oh, my bad.

Sum is a noun. GET the sum of these addends, You could even implement this as a lookup table, which wouldn't be good for sum, of course but for many other functions, its a benefit

Using pd and df is about as standard as using i as a sentinel in a for loop. I'd argue is less readable to write the full names for these because of widespread use. 
&gt; One should avoid using `isinstance` or `type` if possible. **if possible** If you need to use them, use them. People coming from other languages have the habit of separating out functions based on data types, even if the action on the data type is the same. In python, you don't need them until you really do. 
I would be so excited to find a real bug. 
Hi there, this post has been removed as it is not directly related to the Python programming language. It might be more topical on /r/programming, /r/coding, or /r/technology. Cheers, /r/Python mods
If sum is a noun, it shouldn't depend on the GET parameters. Thus it should be, /4/4/5/sum, which is just silly.
Creating a rest API but I don't know much about Python btw I'm very excited.
I use wasavi (chrome extension) exactly for this reason. It provides an embedded vi instance for text entry. 
If you could show us the code, maybe someone could help to improve it.. :)
Well, I am trying to understand how `numpy` populated the array with the sine wave. That one line seems to be done it, and I don't understand the magic. analytic_sine_wave = gain * numpy.exp(-1j * (omega * t - phi))
Bah humbug
Ah. That makes sense. Thanks!
I mean it's asymptotic, but in this case I'd imagine that for small n this would be a micro optimization. Additionally, theres the additional performance hit of loading in a dispatch function from a dictionary, which is probably constantish time as well, but I imagine that's where the real slowdown would occur. 
We have [a pretty long list of learning resources in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index#wiki_new_to_programming.3F). Try a few and see what resonates. For a brand new programmer I'd recommend codecademy. Also, if you don't have one already make sure you look for a project that interests you and start on it as soon as you can. Programming is a lot more fun if you have a goal. Come visit us in /r/learnpython if you get stuck.

It's pretty vague what you write, all I can read is that you have a lot of things and you'd like to do something with it later. Define a list container outside the loop. Add each page to the list inside the loop. ...profit? You are on the right path for looking for Datta structures. Try to get some information on containers Best of luck!

I'm currently using beautiful soup and already am able to scrape a page to my class, does mechanize work better and should I switch to it?

I find it difficult to recommend celery given how frequently they break things, even fairly basic functionally, and how difficult their code is to debug when it happens. Big fan of RQ, personally.
I'd like to know this as well! I've been trying to find an easy to use Gui tool for python
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238
I recommend picking up sublime text. It is powerful as a text editor with it's regex search functionality and super lightweight. I recommend that, while you are still getting used to python as a whole, you don't use an ide like PyCharm because it covers some bases for you that may cause a bit of trouble if you ever have to use a non-Pycharm ide. It's not a big deal though. PyCharm is super good.
You are a braver man than I
Yeah. Maybe you can change it enough so that your general problem still exists but no company information is shared. 
That's possible. It will take a little bit though and I won't be able to do anything on it until tomorrow. 
Without the code it's hard to say how much it can be optimized, but the problem might just be that there's too much data. You could look into cloud computing; this would allow you to run your code on a remote computer with a much faster cpu. It's not free but for what you're doing it would barely cost anything.
Not really possible or practical. It's a one off process and if I waited until ITSec cleared the service, it would never get done.

I made a very simple code timer: https://github.com/paperduck/code_timer
I'm working on a pandas implementation but it's proven.... Troublesome. I think it's because I'm only going for a half ass pandas solution, still shipping things off to functions to be manipulated then shipping them back as a series to be merged into the dataframe. The merging has been the biggest problem.
It looks quite disappointing that the only program that could hold a candle close to glade is deprecated and hasn't been worked on since 2007 according to the thread

And what changes between runs?
See dictionary d2 contains a list against every key. So the only the things that changes is the length of that list which isn't that different from each other. If you are asking about what changes between when i run less and more iteration, its the rate of progression. See how I've printed the variable counter it's printing significantly reduces if the iteration is to be run more.
Then how are you counting iterations?
It will run as long as the fr(which is a list) is
So what actually changes between runs is the length of `fr`, correct?
No fr is just a single list containing integers which are keys, it just read those keys and use them to iterate over similar keys in d2. d2 has a list as a value corresponding to each of it's key. See the for m in d2\[j\] it means it's iterating over that list. So the only thing that changes is that list's length.

I didn't realize duck typing actually works more like 'passing the buck typing' in practice. :) That was quite helpful, I don't think I ever saw this explained as clearly. Thanks!
Is there a reason you are looking for a mobile app ? Say like trying to learn during commute ? I used sololearn for a while and thought it was good but I actually learned the language on my laptop using online courses and books. Also, this should be in /pythonlearning. 
Yeah, laptops are super old and WiFi is shit on them, works better on mobile for some reason 
You seem to be agreeing with me but arguing with both me and you, so i'm a bit confused. im not sure what you're trying to say REST is a very specific thing. when a rest api does more than CRUD operations, it is no longer rest and would probably fall under rpc's domain. your original question should probably be broken down to replacing REST with RPC and JSON with XML
starting/stopping a service for example
Whhaaaattt Thank you for sharing this

This is a good solution. The only problem I can see is that the function will create a a variable number of unique values. Some inputs will only generate two or three, other will generate quite a few more. I'm probably doing it in a really screwed up way but the column header for each item generated starts with Name appended with a text description of the function applied. Each iteration creates a new column, uses the input columns header and appends the description. An example would be an the function that removes parenthesis in the first iteration, the column header would be Initial-Strip_Parens. If the casefold function uses is applied to that column on the second iteration, the header would be Initial-Strip_Parens-Casefold. The reason for it is that I was grilled about how functionality later in the program was working. This way, I can point to the header and say, see, this is how it came up with that. Also, this will allow me to apply weights to the functions and keep track of what the final weight of a given cell will be. I have an idea of how I can use your expression to do that using map() but it's also possible I'm tired and trying to shoehorn in something...
&gt;The thing is it will throw a key error since that key is not existing previously It certainly will not. A dictionary key can be assigned to, even if it isn't yet present in the dictionary... May I ask, what other languages do you have the most experience with? Ie.: `transaction[j] = [str(d1sum)+','+m]` is a completely valid and preferable replacement for the update() clause. Also, you most likely want to use `if j not in transaction` rather than the get() method, for testing whether the j value is present. It's just more idiomatic, and the test against None adds no value (you should also always test for "is None" not "== None".
Hi, you're best using /r/LearnPython for this kinda thing. -- To start you off I'd say break it into steps: * Automate clicking on the course (Selenium) * Automate screenshotting and scrolling * Upload screenshots to OneNote (look at their API) -- You can then break down each step into smaller steps that you can google. Pretty sure OneNote's API is shit, I'd recommend just storing them in a folder (once screenshotted) and browse from there, or upload them manually. I guarantee you'll spend more time trying to automate uploading rather than actually gathering the images.

No I have not, I think I get better image quality by using a single character to represent 2 pixels. My version is probably not as efficient since it's python and numba, I only get like 5fps.

&gt;Maybe consider making this `@type_checked_call(skip=True, convert=True)` Just did exactly that. * `@type_checked_call` is now `@type_checked_call()` * `@type_checked_call_skip` is now `@type_checked_call(skip=True)` * `@type_checked_call_convert` is now `@type_checked_call(convert=True)` * `@type_checked_call_skip_convert` is now `@type_checked_call(skip=True, convert=True)` * `type_checked_apply(func, args)` is now `type_checked_call()(func)(args)` * `type_checked_apply_skip(func, args)` is now `type_checked_call(skip=True)(func)(args)` * `type_checked_apply_convert(func, args)` is now `type_checked_call(convert=True)(func)(args)` * `type_checked_apply_skip_convert(func, args)` is now `type_checked_call(skip=True, convert=True)(func)(args)` I think this is good, because * the API surface is smaller (only one function now) * possible additional parameters in the future will be easier to add * everything looks more unified and elegant * the internal code also is smaller now So, again, thank you. :)
i am new in python, what should i learn first????
Also it gave the error as i told you. I can't upload the error picture
&gt;Can't you help me? You said the fr list isn't growing, so when you talk about the iterations growing, you mean the iteration over d2\[j\] is growing? If each d2\[j\] entry grows by a linear amount, that's a possible super-linear growth right there. Although appending to the lists is constant, if the transactions lists are traversed at all, and they each grow by some proportional amount as the d2\[j\] iterations increase, that could explain it. Basically, this looks like a list-of-lists issue, meaning as some iteration value increases linearly, the overall time is increasing by some amount proportional to O(N\*\*2). Or possibly it's the sorts, which take longer as the d2\[j\] lists grow, multiplied by len(fr). So, tell us more about exactly which iteration is increasing, how the data size grows as the iterations increase, and how then d2 lists grow with respect to the iteration sizes.
ummm. See the thing is nothing is growing, i said changing, the thing is d2 contains a list of dates, so some keys have few dates some have more, that what i meant by changing. And even that is not that much since maximum amount of dates are like 1500 in against some key but most keys have like under 100 or even under 50 or so. So to sum up nothing is growing with iterations. What i don't understand is my original question that why and how does python know how much iterations it is going to run since when i write for j in fr it just means traverse full fr index by index. So how can this trivial thing effect python decision making which is effecting the rate like for e.g i told you to run 5 miles, you started running at like 5 miles/hour but when i told you to run 10 miles you suddenly lost motivation and started running at 2miles/hour.
Can i take my current 3.5 flexible runtimes, change the app.yaml and deploy to standard now? 
Thank you very much, I was having trouble figuring out how to make a plan for it - I'll start doing that from now on. Breaking it into smaller goals instead of trying to find one thing that does it all. I appreciate the advice!!
Nice
Hmm, I wonder if the [**attr**](http://www.attrs.org/en/stable/) **library** has this issue? (I am at work so can't check at the moment).
How much does that list's length change?
* You might want to run the Python profiler over your program to find the real bottlenecks. * You might want to look at what is "Pythonic": If you use regular expressions, do you need too? Are they compiled? * Might you try reading spreadsheet rows into (named?)tuples? * If you can express the bulk of your processing as map'ping a single function over the rows of your spreadsheet; then it should be straightforward to spread the processing over each cpu in your laptop Just some ideas :-)
Yeah, I mean you can't Google: '*click course ... screenshot page ... save page ... onenote*' but you can Google each part broken down
&gt;Pretty sure OneNote's API is shit, I'd recommend just storing them in a folder Much simpler: just send Ctrl-V to paste it into Onenote.
I'm working on an astrodynamics utility that can calculate delta-v budgets, fuel masses, transfer windows, etc. for spacecraft. I haven't been doing that much programming yet, since I've spent the past week figuring out licensing. However, since that is now finished I can start work on the main tasks. I've still got quite a long way to go (got to figure out how to use pyside2 for GUI), but I'm optimistic that I can make good progress in the coming weeks.
Brings back memories - doing this with the first TV cards from hauppage with the bt chip. TV in ASCII on the commanline ... 
Pyautogui could be good for this. In fact, pyautogui could probably do the whole thing.
Your doing a lot of weird things in your code, which don't seem logically correct and I'm sorry if this comes off as a bit condesending, but are you sure the code even works before you are concerned about performance characteristics? At the very least I'd consider using "in" instead of trying to use .get() to see if a key is in a dictionary. 
I like this! Nice work! 
There's many ways to do it, but here's how I did it: # Note map just for the first octave note_map = { 'Ab': 7.5, 'A': 1, 'A#': 1.5, 'Bb': 1.5, 'B': 2, 'C': 3, 'C#': 3.5, 'Db': 3.5, 'D': 4, 'D#': 4.5, 'Eb': 4.5, 'E': 5, 'F': 6, 'F#': 6.5, 'Gb': 6.5, 'G': 7, 'G#': 7.5, } # Add the lowercase values to that note map (to save on typing) for note, code in note_map.copy().items(): note_map[note.lower()] = code + 7 def encode(song: str) -&gt; str: """Takes a string of notes and turns them into numbers""" notes = song.split(' ') coded_notes = list(map(lambda note: str(note_map[note]), notes)) return ' '.join(coded_notes) # Run the function and print the result print(encode("B C a D# c A")) `2 3 8 4.5 10 1` First, you split the string on spaces, which gives you a list of strings. Then for each one in the list, you get the dictionary value for that note and add those to a new list. You'll want to convert these to strings for the next step, which is to join those strings into one big string, separated by spaces. Finally, return that.
&gt;See the thing is nothing is growing, i said changing You aren't providing information that can help us help you. **What loop is increasing iterations?** Is it the 'fr' list that increases from 6.5k iterations to 46k iterations (ie. the number of d2 entries)? Or is it increases in the 'd2' dictionary list lengths that are increasing when you see this slowdown? Can you remove the sorting (temporarily) and see what effect that has on the speeds? **What are the specific timings that you are seeing?** When the iterations double (say from 6.5k to 13k), what is the change in time? Or what actual time values at all can you give us as the iterations increase? &gt;why and how does python know how much iterations it is going to run Python knows how many elements are in a list, or keys in a dictionary. It'll run that many iterations. &gt;when i write for j in fr it just means traverse full fr index by index. Is there a reason you aren't using range() or enumerate(), for your loops? Are the index orders non-sequential? It's more typical to iterate over the entries in d2 directly, unless order is important. &gt;So how can this trivial thing effect python decision making You have two loops. Inside the double loop you have a selection of two variables from app, which (possibly) requires 2 scans to return a result, times the size of the inner loop, then times the size of the outer loop (which also has a sort). That's more than enough to get into slowdowns, especially because Pandas dataframes are notoriously slow to retrieve values from (though it has gotten numerous improvements over time). There's not enough information on your data to know if that's the issue, but I suspect it may be, and it has nothing to do with Python loops per-se. I'm guessing, if there is an issue, it's with the ampersand selection from app, or the repeated sorts (or very unlikely, but it could be the repeated sum()s). But, that's really the most speculation I can do with the information you have provided. When the iterations change from 6.5k to 46k, which variables have changed to make that happen?
why not just use true color? [https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728](https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728)
Can just as well use the iTerm2 extensions if supported to show the image inline, as is.
This is just awesome
&gt; **What loop is increasing iterations?** Yes the number of d2 entries increases from 6.5K etc. Also just to be clear the one with 6.5k and the one with 45K two diff runs of the same code, in case this wasn't clear. &gt; **What are the specific timings that you are seeing?** The one with 3.5k takes about 16 seconds, one with 9k takes 2 minutes, the one with 30K takes 36 min. See its not scaling properly which was my original question. &gt; Is there a reason you aren't using range() or enumerate(), for your loops? Are the index orders non-sequential? It's more typical to iterate over the entries in d2 directly, unless order is important. Yes they aren't sequences just random integers like phone numbers.(the keys are) Also sorry for not providing with enough info. If you have any other question regarding my code i will answer and i know my code is difficult to get without context but yeah. Thank you for sticking with me though.
not much the avg is like under 100 or some even under 50. They are a handful with like 1000 entries but that's it.
Yes, my code works big time, i ran it dozens and dozens of times, it just the time thing i am concerned here not it's correctness. I know this doesn't make sense and that's because you don't have the context.Also another person suggested me the same(the "in" thing) and i did it, it doesn't seem to have any big impact.
Does the size of the lists grow with the iteration count?

&gt;Yes the number of d2 entries increases from 6.5K etc. The number of d2 entries increases, which means that it's the length of 'fr' which is increasing. Ie. the outer loop is growing. &gt;See its not scaling properly which was my original question. By "properly", I assume you mean linearly with the length of 'fr'. What is the max length of the lists in d2, and are they the same when 'fr' is increased? I still suspect the possibility that the iteration count is growing in 2 dimensions, not just one. If you put the 'counter += 1' inside the inner loop (and maybe only print it in the outer loop), does that increase linearly with fr, or quadratically? Finally, like I said, I suspect the time to evaluate the search of 'app' that assigns to the 'a', may take longer than you think it does. Perhaps you can use one of the builtin Python profilers to gather more information on which parts are actually taking up all the time: [https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html) [https://docs.python.org/3/library/debug.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/debug.html) Note, you can call a profiler module on the command line, such as: python -m cProfile -s cumtime path/to/your/python/script.py args

Hey! Thanks for the reply!! I tried replacing QWidget with QMainWindow but then it's like I have no background color! What is the ID of the MainWindow? 
There isn't one by default, but you can assign one.
I believe the property is called "object name" in Qt Designer, and then you use the `#someName` selector in CSS.
After your suggestion I found [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8983345/get-variable-name-of-qt-widget-for-use-in-stylesheet) QA. I tried it but it doesn't deem to work, maybe because it's for PyQt4, although my explanation doesn't seem likely. More specifically I did 1) `&lt;string notr="true"&gt;#centralwidget{` 2) `&lt;string notr="true"&gt;QWidget#centralwidget{` 3) `&lt;string notr="true"&gt;QMainWindow#MainWindow{` and left the rest of the Code from the QMainWindow unchanged.
Did you set the object name in the editor?

tkinter is capable of making some good functional GUIs. They may not be fancy, but for some things they'll beat a CLI every time. File / Folder Browsing has already been mentioned as one way a GUI is superior. You can change the colors, bevel depths, etc, with tkinter, so that all GUIs don't look for grey. Here is a tkinter-based GUI that contains most of the standard widgets. It was created using a wrapper for tkinter called [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/MikeTheWatchGuy/PySimpleGUI). The advantage to using something like this is that you can get a GUI like this one in 20 lines of code.

Did you see this one in the comments? https://github.com/alejandroautalan/pygubu Seems to be inspired by Glade and is in active dev still.
Data analysis job requirements are something like: \-Analytical skills: Working with large amounts of data: facts, figures, and number crunching. One will need to see through the data and analyze it to find conclusions. \-Communication skills: Data analysts are often called to present their findings, or translate the data into an understandable document. You will need to write and speak clearly, easily communicating complex ideas. \-Critical thinking: Data analysts must look at the numbers, trends, and data and come to new conclusions based on the findings. \-Attention to detail: Data is precise. Data analysts have to make sure they are vigilant in their analysis to come to correct conclusions. \-Math skills: Data analysts need math skills to estimate numerical data.
Is that including rendering to terminal or just image processing? Depending on the renderer in the terminal you can get huge performance differences. 
What do you mean by "supports OpenCV"? It's a third party library, and it will run on whatever Python version you build it for.
&gt;Ok, Ok, Ok, It worked &lt;property name="styleSheet"&gt; &lt;string notr="true"&gt;QWidget#centralwidget{ background-color:qlineargradient(spread:repeat, x1:0, y1:1, x2:1, y2:0, stop:0 rgba(39, 21, 103, 255), stop:1 rgba(94, 94, 140, 255)) } QPushButton{ background-color: qlineargradient(spread:pad, x1:0.915, y1:0.227273, x2:1, y2:0, stop:0 rgba(255, 255, 255, 255), stop:1 rgba(56, 56, 140, 255)); font: 75 8.5pt &amp;quot;Sitka Small&amp;quot;; } QToolButton{background-color: qlineargradient(spread:pad, x1:0.915, y1:0.227273, x2:1, y2:0, stop:0 rgba(255, 255, 255, 255), stop:1 rgba(56, 56, 140, 255)); font: 75 8.5pt &amp;quot;Sitka Small&amp;quot;; } QLabel{ color: rgb(255, 255, 255); } font: 75 8.5pt &amp;quot;Sitka Small&amp;quot; &lt;/string&gt; &lt;/property&gt;
oh , so if i download 3.7 it will work?
Thank you , will delete post :P 
Great work, I really like this!
I've really grown to like these operators in Perl, Kotlin, C# etc., and would be happy to see them in Python to reduce boilerplate. Yes, more operators can mean more confusion, but they're easy to get used to and make semantic expressions more compact while giving potential `None` more visibility.
An ongoing series of articles about storing data with Python. From plain text files, to binary formats, SQLite and HDF5.
Namedtuples and dataclasses may be similar, but where they don't overlap, they solve different use-cases. For example, I might wrap a result from a database in a namedtuple, to give a name to and preserve order of information. If I have a function that returns a tuple of values, I'll reach for a namedtuple to dispel ambiguity. 
Good question. I'll poke and prod at it when I get some time.
Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. I highly recommend posting your question there. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster.

Every big I've found was user error, except one, which was strongly defended as "a feature". 
You can look at the changelog to see differences with each version [https://docs.python.org/3.6/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-6-5-final](https://docs.python.org/3.6/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-6-5-final)
I've inherited a legacy system (not just myself, about a hundred more programmers). The system was started some 20 years ago. It's about reporting financial transactions between all sorts of legal entities, mostly banks and funds. The most pressing problem about this system is that nobody, and I mean, literally, nobody knows how it works, or how it was supposed to work. Remarkably, Q&amp;A has the best insight into it, but, unfortunately, their understanding is very limited, and always was that way. Recently, I was doing some digging around old documents, and discovered the XSD that was meant to describe the protocol that today is used by the legacy part of the system. The modern part moved towards Protobuf / JSON. The interesting part of my situation is that while the system transitions into its new form, right now it needs to take its input in XML, and output it in Protobuf / JSON. My particular task, or rather a research project was to try to automatically generate inputs for the system, and match them against the outputs to see if the system functions as it should. ---- Now, what I've discovered is that both XSD and Protobuf definitions were horribly written. The authors were borderline incompetent and did all the basic mistakes one could possibly make. However, and quite surprisingly, I discovered that XSD left me room for improving the schema **without** modifying the code that implements the schema! In other words, the schema was too loose for what the code was actually doing, but, I could tighten it up, and not recompile even a single Java file. The situation with swaggers and Protobuf is not as great... You cannot make any changes to the schema without changing the code that implements it. Not to mention that schemas of swagger / Protobuf have way less tools for expressing business concepts. There are no way to express things like "x should be a subset of y", or "if x has a property p, then y should have a property q", and the list doesn't stop here, but I'll spare you the details. Bottom line: I hated XML when it was popular, I hate it still with a burning passion. But, JSON or Protobuf are even worse...
ATBS is easy to read, free, and a lot of people have read it (easy to ask for help). Udemy courses are of varying quality, not always free, and if you have questions they might not be answered.
Hmm.. they're both by Al Sweigart. I'm looking more for input from someone who has reviewed both if there's anyone out there (trying to justify giving me a break from reading textbooks).
That's everything. I got it up to 8fps using numba parallel. 
scrapy or beautiful soup + something will do
