In general, sure. But we're talking about the absolute basics in a Python-oriented piece of learning material. &amp;#x200B; You've shared your experiences of the book and the experience of your learner, and I've shared my experiences of it and the experience of my learners. Not everyone's gotta have the same experience.
One of the great features of python, for me, is being able to implement complex operations with a series of embedded or chained operations, which bypasses the naming problem altogether. This introduces it's own readability issues, but can be ameliorated with sophisticated white space usage, like when using black. And the result is better than introducing a handful of temporary variables

exactly. and the FAQ remains unconvincing as a critique of the book as a learning resource. which was my whole point.
I mean, it's an FAQ, not a full-scale book review. Bear in mind that it was written for the Discord server rather than Reddit - people have short attention spans, and a short answer is much more likely to be read. &amp;#x200B; At this point this comment thread is just nitpicking, IMO. You do you.

Would anyone recommend any of these for an experienced developer wanting to cross train into python? I've recently started Fluent Python, but would to keen to hear anyones thoughts on other resources.
Python 3 added a lot of syntactical garbage: f-strings, async family, more exuberant syntax for error handling. It created a lot of uncertainty about the use of string literals by adding then removing then readding them. Python 3 added a lot of dunder methods, involved and very buggy import system. This is only the things I run into on the daily basis.
Wtf.. Learn python the hard way is one of the best python books around. The author being a dick about python2 is annoying but it doesn't change the fact that the book series is good.
We use a private PyPi we built over S3. It has worked well for us over the past few years with the largest pain point being that it can be hard to get private packages into containers. We often pull the private packages down locally and then copy them into the container to avoid putting authentication tokens in the container.
That's not true at all! It's a great resource. Don't confuse the author with the objective quality of the book.
Is that limit due to the limit being set in the tweet_creator function? You have ‘’’limit=10’’’
TBH I didn't your source code, but the standard solution is Imports Intit stuff While (True): Do stuff Wrap up stuff
Yes, that is why
You tried buildout? 
I find it interesting...
&gt; When all of the Python codeon your computer is Python 3... That time is now. On Windows, I only have Py3 installed, Ubuntu 18 doesn't rely on Py2 anymore (as far as I am aware). Python 3 is now, Python 2 is history (almost). Also, this might be one of the reasons why LPTHW is discouraged by the sidebar of r/learnpython.
Reddit API apparently limits you to 1000 items for a given request. https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjW4MyUy7bgAhUIWN8KHfkKA6cQzPwBegQIARAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fredditdev%2Fcomments%2F7kwkrc%2Fpython_scrapy_and_reddit_limitations%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw3vO7rfL_yo4fQxD4yJS8Er&amp;ust=1550074373652799 What you could do to find unique submissions and run continuously is to put the main in a while loop and use a data structure to keep track of already seen submission IDs. Make sure to set a wait time in between each request, however. 
Good and bad can come down to personal preference, but in this case, Python the Hard Way takes the attitude of "Do what I say, just do it." and leaves the reader to figure out why something works the way it does on their own. It's very condescending. It teaches objectively bad programming practices, such as calling a function, that calls a function, that calls a function, etc. I have no opinion about the author, except the material he provided is ordered poorly, and of controversial design. IMO it is not a good starting point for anyone getting into the language. 
I would argue that learning python has a lot to do with python itself...

Zed Shaw is full of shit and should be rightly ignored. He's made some patently absurd claims, and he still stands behind his statement. It isn't dated. Hell, he's doubled down, making the absurd claim that because Python 3 isn't exactly the same as Python 2, it isn't Turing complete (an asinine claim, as people have written Brainfuck compilers/interpreters in Python 3, which functions as a constructive proof of his being wrong). You need to choose another source. You should learn Python 3, not Python 2. Python 2's end of life is coming fast.
Looks great ! Thanks!
There's so much misconception in the question, I don't think there's a good way to answer it. 1. Yes, you can pass functions in C++, if you mean procedures. 2. No, there aren't any functions in C++, there are procedures. 3. "Statically typed" is a meaningless expression / probably doesn't mean what you think it means. 4. How the language is typed has nothing to do with objects / not in the sense that you seem to believe. 5. Nobody knows what "object" means, it's a matter of opinion. There isn't any good definition most or at least a big fraction of people would agree on. 6. Not everything in Python is an object. The amount of non-objects will depend on your definition of an object. Only in some wakey sense, if you specifically define everything in Python to be an object, you can have it, but then you will start having paradoxes, similar to the set-of-all-sets paradox. Objects used to be all the rage in the 90s. Today, people forgot about how it was all hype-driven programming back then, and similar to how Catholicism developed from early Christians, became even more dogmatic and more narrow-minded. So, if in the 90s objects were a "nonsense in the making", today it's a "ten commandments of nonsense". There are several branches of this nonsense, similar to how the great synod of 1054 broke away the Eastern Schism from the Catholic church, or how later Luther put his manifesto on the door of his church thus starting off all sorts of Evangelic churches. Ultimately though, despite the great variety, tradition and continued effort to refine the idea, nothing seems to come out of it. But, people involved with the concept become ever more radicalized.
What qualifies a person as unique? Would wearing a bow-tie at business casual count? Or do you have to pair it with a fez? Would having a monomaniacal interest in the movie "Pretty Woman" be unique or just weird? (Asking for a friend) And how does Reddit know how unique someone is?

Using QPython to write Python code when on mobile. One problem: I can't use packages I installed from PyPI while using pygame. Has to do with the #qpy:pygame comment. Which also forces me to use Python 2 even though I installed 3.6. Also, I wrote some code to make circles circle around a point. Noticeable stuttering in movement. Even with one circle.
These 3 are my favorite and I recommend people who want to learn python by themselves to read them by following the left-to-right order. I saw some people don't like LPTHW. I agree that this book's content is way too 'mechanic', but that might not be a bad thing for people who haven't written a single line of code. Following this book to write code could give them a general idea about what programming and Python are, and they can move forward.

Four or so years ago... It's lame / immature / nothing to write home about. It's another wrapper around a ton of bad building blocks, so you get the downsides of all the bad building blocks topped with the bugs and problems of the tool itself, which sometimes amplify the underlying problems. But, it's not even as much of a problem of the tool itself as much it is a problem of the language and the ecosystem it created. Python's module system is stupid. The way the interpreter locates modules is bad, and nobody can fix it. The problem on the ecosystem side is that... well, there's a lot of random stuff on `pypi`, and the existing tools taught the users that this garbage will work. It's a very similar situation to how web browsers gave up on proper HTML parsing many years ago, and today they try to salvage whatever they can from the tag soup that any HTML page is. The action that by itself created a bad tradition of trying to play into this insanity. So, suppose you are used to that you can do something like `pip install memcached`. You don't even think what's actually going to happen. Maybe you understand that there should be a memcached library somewhere in your system, but you have no idea where `pip` will be looking for it. And, in many cases, `pip` will not look for it. Using a decision procedure which is obscure even to the authors of `pip`, it will try to install some package, depending on what's available on `pypi` to match your platform and Python. Maybe it'll find a binary package that should match your system, but it won't because your library is in the wrong place. Maybe it will find a source package, but your header files for this library don't match the actual library and so on. There is no real way to make this system work reliably unless *all* components are under your control, but the world turned out to be the way, where this is just not the case. Even if you are developing some hard-core infrastructure products, like SoC or kernel-side code, (well, not in Python, obviously), you still have to deal with third-party code. With Python, the fraction of your own code in this system is negligible...
&gt; f-strings Most people find them much easier to use, but you don't have to use them and it will never get in your way if you don't. &gt; async family Async code is intrinsically hard but again you _don't have to use this_ and I almost never see it in client code at all. &gt; more exuberant syntax for error handling Do you mean this? Python 2: try: # except Exception, e: Python 3: try: # except Exception as e: Exuberant is a weird word, but the second syntax seems a lot clearer to me, and is certainly more consistent with the rest of Python. &gt; involved and very buggy import system. Let's see these "bugs"! 
oh wow i didnt expect such a simple question would raise so much hate towards the writer i mentioned. But what is interesting are the facts: "[https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2018/](https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2018/) Python 3 adoption: 84% Python 3 to 16% Python 2. Python 2 EOL is 2020." That answers my question. Thank you all for your input.
Is it good for someone who already knows programming decently well? I want to get moderate/advanced skills with python but don't have many projects under my belt. Thoughts? 
Coursera has a lot of awesome online classes on Python. Some are free, but if you want some type of Certification, you have to pay for it.

Oh my god, Alogojammer looks fucking awesome! Algorithmic visualization?! That's awesome! When you're constructing some tough logic I can 100% see that being incredibly, incredibly useful for testing and debugging.

It's about a specific sub, not generally about the learning process, otherwise I'd agree.
What's the difference between poetry and pipenv? (I've only used the latter.)
It might be worth going and looking through the online free versions right into the projects sections. Then you can decide better for yourself. 
Eh, you are mainly incorrect.
I've spent the week coding an orbit fractal generator (i.e. the Mandelbrot Set and similar) using pygame. I've managed to implement proper coloring, zooming and moving around, as well as saving the screenshots. The only problem is it's painfully slow so I'm trying to find a faster way to implement it 
I don't know the answer, and this is directly related, but I would like to point out that this is one of the nice things about requirements.txt, pip, and virtualenvs. Instead of having to do what you're talking about, you would install python like you normally do on your OS and then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in whatever virtualenv.

I think it's joking about python having "batteries included," but often the batteries are not the best, so you have to use an external library anyway.
SQLers rise up!

Only minor adjustments are necessary depending on: - Python version - OS - root/user installation - whether you use pylauncher on Windows
I honestly don’t really understand what this sub is about. Most times people post something they get downvoted and yelled at to go post on learnpython. I guess this sub is about the literal snake..
I got a book very similar to the one on the middle but it’s call “Automating The Boring Stuff With Python” any different?
If you want to feel motivated watch any David Beazley talk on Youtube. Absolute magic with simple sentences and some Python tricks. My two favourites : # David Beazley: Discovering Python - PyCon 2014 # [https://youtu.be/RZ4Sn-Y7AP8](https://youtu.be/RZ4Sn-Y7AP8) # Learn Python Through Public Data Hacking [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrPZza\_vZ3w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrPZza_vZ3w) &amp;#x200B;
Yes, I think this is right. The thing about batteries being included is that often the batteries are AAs that have been stored on a shelf in a warehouse for 15 years before they were shipped in the remote for your generic brand VCR.
We are spending atleast 2 hours everyday from February to August, we have 4 people working on it and we all agreed on a fairly simple game to not make it too complicated
What choices would you recommend? Python is the only language I really know, but my knowledge isn’t that great anyway, so learning a new language won’t be an issue for me.

Python doesn't understand shell commands. Fortunately, it comes with a module to run them in another process. Check out the subprocess module.

Somehow I ended up downloading 2.7.6 from python.org. Thanks for the help. 
So I'm a fairly hobbyist web developer, got into python a few months ago for backend stuff. Started using pycharm because I found it suggested, and seeing as the last time I had seriously coded was a decade ago, pycharm has been blowing me away with how comprehensive it is. I can't help but feel I'm not utilizing it as much as I can though. To be honest, I've never been very good at taking advantage of the features of an IDE beyond syntax highlighting, project management, and library/module management. Any good resources out there that give a crash course on cool things pycharm does that someone may not know about if they aren't experienced with IDE's?
Thanks, I'll check that out! 
I have the one in the middle. I'm having such trouble plowing through. I really want to learn but keep losing motivation.
this graph only cares about subs that begin with r/learn
Hey there. First of all: Your code looks really good considering that you just started using Python 8 months ago. Have you been programming in other languages before? &amp;#x200B; OOP: At university, they taught us OOP by implementing projects in Java and a general lecture about software engineering/software design. The gist of these courses was: If you have complex requirements, don't hesitate to design the architecture of your project with pen and paper first using UML charts etc before even writing the first line of code. For some theoretical input, I can recommend the book *"clean architecture"* by Robert C. Martin (not sponsored). From my personal experience, I learnt the most about software design and OOP by simply doing projects and getting feedback from fellow programmers or coworkers. Would be very cool to read about your journey in the future on how you tackled improving your skills.
The notion that memorization is a bad learning strategy is far from disputed, though. This has nothing to do with the personality of the books' author.
This is pretty close to a standard environment monitoring setup. You can monitor things like temperature, light, and current to produce data that you can act on. For a platform, using a raspberry pi or Arduino is a good choice. Grab a waterproof temperature sensor, hall effect sensor, and light sensor from adafruit, they provide Python libraries to use them. You can monitor temperature and the current pulled by the water pump and report if anything is too far from normal. You can use the light sensor to detect burned out lights, and to decide what help decide what normal means for temperature and current drawn by the pump.
The thing here is not that you shouldn't know, but whether you should care or not, if you want to understand what that library is doing, sure, go ahead and read the implementation, if you just need to make an API call you shouldn't worry too much

Kinda surprised about the SQL number.
i just started the one on the left as well as an udemy crash course. 
Essentially all it means is that Python doesn't deal with primitives like ints or floats in quite the same way as other languages. Instead it deals with objects that "wrap" the primitive provided additional functionality. In code, you're not manipulating an int directly, for example, you're dealing with an int object. If you pass a float to a function, you're not passing a float value to the function, you're passing a reference to a float object. r/learnpython is probably a better place for this kind of question.
Are you in IT? What I've found is that it's easier for me to learn if I'm trying to automate a simple task (like set a user account to change password at next login). Super simple tasks at first are really helpful.
The best book on OOP design I've found is [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Agile-Primer/dp/0134456475/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=object+oriented+agile&amp;qid=1549999607&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-2). I highly recommend it. It's in Ruby, not Python, but this should not matter at all. OOP is not specific to Python (if anything, Python programmers care a lot less about OOP than, say, Java programmers).
The over-engineered bikelight I call the HYPELIGHT [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Po9k6otzyg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Po9k6otzyg) runs a main program to control the light and a secondary program to run the web server to control the light. it can run independent of wires (except for power) and is controlled by my phone using wifi hotspot.
This probably surprised me the most. Although the game has a lot to learn.
Exactly. Machines with many cores, lot of RAM, GPUs, staying alive while your machine is in sleep mode etc.
Ok, and how to output this data? would it go to a display... or could i make it into a webpage or something? Also i am not looking to reinvent the wheel so yes things that are standard are good.
&gt; Most people find them much easier to use We've been here before. Most people writing in Python are cretins. It doesn't matter what their opinion is. The problem is you cannot use this shit in libraries because it's going to blow, and there's no way to protect against it. This feature is a symptom of design by committee mainly consisting of cretins, whose main goal is to put their signature on the popular product and then run around showing everyone that they did something for this hugely popular product. But, I cannot not use it, if I write in Python, because a shithead like you will use it, and I will have to deal with it. Because my work is infrastructure. I fix problems that you create because you are incompetent as a programmer, but you got on this bandwagon. Popularity fuels this business. I can fix problems that idiots like you create, but I cannot fix idiots. And that's the sad part. &gt; Async code is intrinsically hard Yeah, you are retarded. I'm saying that async code added syntacitc garbage to the language, but you cannot even read that much... &gt; Do you mean this? No... lol. Try raise from and raise 1, 2, 3 and raise without arguments and why it works somewhere but not elsewhere. &gt; Let's see these "bugs"! No need to quote bugs. There are tons. But, most importantly, things like namespace packages, custom package loaders, packages with multiple source paths, packages defined in native code -- don't really work. I mean, they work 80-90% of the time. Maybe these figures are good for an clown like you. I cannot with a straight face tell a client that a program works, if it works in 80-90% of the time. 
Maybe it is because UNIQUE isn't a keyword in SQL but DISTINCT is--even though they can usually be used interchangeably. I would assume that the users in r/learnsql would be a bit pedantic about it and claim they don't have UNIQUE posters but have DISTINCT posters.

I don't need to deal with humans. I cannot fix morons. Unfortunately, I can only fix what morons do. I don't need superpowers just like I don't need people skills. I'm good. I want a world where Python and people developing it died a painful death, and humanity went back to use decent or even good programming languages. Where language quality is established by objective criteria instead of marketing circus. World where return on investment in research or development is greater than ROI on capital, and, especially popularity capital. And I know that I will not live in a world like that, and nobody will. Even though such a world is possible and it only depends on people whom it would benefit the most. And, you are a moron, because you are not getting it. That's, kind of, really simple.
Doesn't surprise me at all with how much people invest in that game.
Not knowing imported code by heart, but only by docs means you don't have assumptions maybe?
Save the excel file as multiple csvs. That should speed the read process.
If it's working for you so far, who cares what some rando on reddit thinks? Keep going, and it wont be the last book you read on python anyway.
Thank you! No I have not programmed before. I knew from reading around the internet that standards and formatting are very important so I have made a point to try and read the PEPs when applicable (you can clearly tell I read the PEP on docstrings before I wrote the GDB class haha). I will definitely check out the book. Thank you very much for your input. I will have to post an update down the line!
Awesome. Thank you for the feedback!
[removed]
&gt; I don't need to deal with humans. But, you're talking to them now. If you want to convince other people of the things you say you want to convince them of, you are poorly-optimized for that. &gt; I'm good. So far, you have not demonstrated this. For example: &gt; I want a world where Python and people developing it died a painful death, and humanity went back to use decent or even good programming languages. Where language quality is established by objective criteria instead of marketing circus. World where return on investment in research or development is greater than ROI on capital, and, especially popularity capital. Your comments are making this _less likely_. You are demonstrating your lack of knowledge about how the endeavor of programming works, about how people work, and about how the world works. &gt; And, you are a moron, because you are not getting it. That's, kind of, really simple. I mean, you effectively acknowledge that people who communicate better than you are shaping the future of python and yet you cannot grasp that your poor ability to communicate means you will have no ability to shape the future of python. I'm pretty sure there is at least one person here who is not getting it and that person is not me.
Why should I care if this world is less likely, if I know that the likelihood is zero anyways? No, my motivation for writing this is that it hurts morons. And I don't care if morons improve -- because they won't. I just enjoy it when they hurt. People who communicate better are shaping something? Hahaha, no more than my cat is shaping the politics of United Nations. They just follow along without any thoughts what so ever.
There is that. If you're really bored you could ask them to explain joins using venn diagrams. 
Just from observation, this sub is *mostly* for discussion of meta-topics around Python, by people who know what they're into. Sometimes simple questions will get help here, but you could understand why things like "what is EOL error when I write print('hello world) in the computer?" get stomped on.
&gt; Why should I care if this world is less likely, if I know that the likelihood is zero anyways? A lot of the most popular libraries and patterns have been designed or described by just some dude who knew how to communicate. &gt; People who communicate better are shaping something? Hahaha, no more than my cat is shaping the politics of United Nations. They just follow along without any thoughts what so ever. And how do you think people doing the following know what it is they are following?
I can't say there is. Functionally is there any difference or only syntactically? 
It’s good to familiarise yourself with other people’s coding standards, but you don’t need to read whole libraries - if you have an issue don’t refuse to click “go to declaration” but don’t read the whole library before using it either
Like the other guy said - it could be possible that your system is bottlenecked by RAM speed or bandwidth - split the process to first convert the document to a bunch of CSV files and then process them (separately if possible, I know there are a couple of multi threading libraries for python - you might have better luck with a different one. Btw use three \` symbols to embed code in Reddit. \`\`\` Like this \`\`\`
I don't understand at all but it looks cool.

Using flask, I’ve continued to work on an sms service to notify you when PAX badges go on sale https://paxchecker.com
`requests` is on Github and it's a fairly trivial project, so nothing to worry about. It doesn't do anything groundbreaking. Quite the contrary. `requests` is based on `urllib` project (sometimes this project has digits in its name). Which is also a wrapper around `http` Python package. `http` package is the one which does heavy lifting by actually implementing HTTP protocol. But it's interface is so-so. There was definitely no need for two wrappers around `http` package. I'd wish there was none, but one would be kind of tolerably. Two is a sign of failure somewhere. So, how do I know all of this? Of course, I never looked at the source of what I import!
Exactly this. For what it's worth, I did LPTHW around 6-7 years ago and it got me through my first year of university computer science. The book has really expanded since then, too
Thank you! 
Thanks man!
Why buy a book from someone who quite deliberately slagged off the very language that he attempts, very badly, to write about? Way better is Al Sweigart's "Automate the boring stuff with python", sorry but I'm too lazy to look up a url for you :-)
I just recently came across this. I think it makes total sense and would simplify the whole virtual environment thing. 
Thanks for the tips
Well, don't use flask either because the author was also talking shit about python 3. He just wasn't as entertaining. Flask is the longest running April fool's joke.
Testing edge cases with a tree structure for text analysis and classification as well as optimizing the processing the tree does as a whole. I basically organize a list of keywords into a suffix trie like structure and now I need to see if it works correctly when I try to break the tree. If I get lucky I might migrate it down to c instead of python but I'm not sure this week will be that productive. With early stress testing I am something 2x to 5x slower than a standard method (kmer) but this version is 2x to 4x faster than my previous implementation of this method. And what I lose in speed I gain in flexibility that the kmer can't provide. Hopefully that translates to resolution in sequence distinction during classification. Really I'm going to be sitting in front of my terminal typing in different text and seeing if the output is what I expect. 
Find out about your local Python conference and go. They're amazingly intense learning experiences, as well as a great way to meet other Python users! 
I'm willing to bet that fortnite has more commentators than Dota2
&gt;I'm willing to bet that cancer has more commentators than Dota2 FTFY ^(Bleep bloop. I am a carcinogenic bot |) ^[info](http://redd.it/amo7ot/)
&gt;I'm pretty familiar with programming concepts &gt; &gt;What made you get the books instead of... you know.. trying the language? Because I don't pretend to know everything, and I learn best through books. 
ROFL, smoke a cigar. This is the best bone apple tea I've seen in a while.
If you're talking about /r/learndota2, then yes I'd assume the main Fortnite sub would have more commentors. Probably wouldn't be the case if it's the main /r/DotA2 sub

Nope. I’m sticking to it. There are too many reviews recommending this book to have a few discourage me from it. I’ll automate after this one. Thanks tho
Huh half a million still subscribed to that damn game. Life is so much better without it

The graph exposed how much of a loser python fanboys are.
Friends don't let friends re-implement `node_modules`.
Little late here but I think I can explain. The underscore prefix to the variable does nothing. From another page: &gt; A single underscore before a name is used to specify that the name is to be treated as “private” by a programmer. It’s kind of* a convention so that the next person (or yourself) using your code knows that a name starting with _ is for internal use. It appears to be a styling technique of PEP-8. Since they used an underscore for a small code snippet to follow PEP-8, there's a possibility that they used some type of generator/script to 'beautify' the code, and the script used PEP-8 styling to give it the underscore. Or maybe it's just a habit of theirs.
Sometimes it's nice to know the differences between two simlar/related libraries. For example os.rename and shutil.move can have similar results but their behavior differs. Shutil.move will usually just use os.rename to move a file but if the destination is on a separate disk it will copy then delete the source. Just reading up on the documentation will suffice most of the time as others have said. There's nothing inheritently wrong with digging down into the code if you're curious though and you may just find an issue that you can help fix.
According to the comparison in the [pikepdf](https://github.com/pikepdf/pikepdf) docs, PyPDF2 supports "Only obsolete RC4" encryption.
Tools that try to solve many problems usually fail. Mostly because what problems people have or what they perceive as problems differ. Python there are two (more really) sets of problems that are often conflated; how do I deploy, how do I develop. I've found https://pypi.org/project/vex/ to be a great tool for the "how do I develop". Makes virtenvs easy, transparent, obvious, deterministic. No wondering what is active, having to activate, where virtenvs are, etc. Just "vex myproject" and you have clean new shell ready to rock in the myprojet virtenv. exit that shell and you are back to whatever state you were before. Need to quickly test something in virgin env. (new lib, that your projet still setup.py installs) vex -mr tmp. The -m is make, the -r is remove. So this will create virtenv, put me "in it" (new shell) and when I exit remove the virtenv. 
r/learnpython would be the best place to ask this. 
As an aside, has anyone put a PEP together for this feature?
I work for a bookmaker and I'm making a tool that uses our API and a competitors API to compare our odds to theirs. If the odds difference is big enough to arb it will send an email to me highlighting which fixture and market.
Cool idea, but would probably more useful as a native python API than as your own language. Could also give the user more flexibility in parallelization. Looks like you put a lot of work into it tho, so props for that.
You are on a dirty path. Can you? Yes. Should you? No. Or at least not without knowing what you are doing. You have to first figure out what the OSI 7 layer model is and then figure out how to access it correctly. Good engineering designs should be done in layers and in such a manner that you can rip an entire layer out, without the rest of the system skipping a beat. Crossing layers is where things blow up.

Definitely try poetry, it blows pipenv out of the water.
It's *about* those subreddits, but /r/learnpython's position in the chart reveals info about Python itself. Additionally, this image has nothing to do with learning Python, so it wouldn't belong over there any more
This would probably be a good blog post for me to write. Right now, probably Amazon reviews, or look up their titles on the /r/python and /r/learnpython subreddits and see what people say.
This troll trolls!
Why?
I thought OP might have been misled by the confusing labels on the y-axis. It looks like it's just for /r/python - "learn" subreddits isn't particularly descriptive and can be interpreted in a few different ways.
many of the "import \*" statements to reduce ambiguity. Will work on the dictionary mapping feature you suggested next. Great suggestions, Metabyte2!

EZSheets, a Pythonic interface to the Google Sheets API that actually works as of Feb 2019. https://github.com/asweigart/ezsheets (I update the "as of" part of the module description so that people know if I've abandoned this module. That's important when dealing with an online service that can change on you.) Dealing with the Google Sheets API is... a bit frustrating. Their API is comprehensive but kind of tedious, and if you just want to do simple, basic tasks you have to learn all sorts of details. I'm writing EZSheets to fix that: You log in to your Google account, click a button to generate a credentials.json file, then run code like: &gt;&gt;&gt; import ezsheets &gt;&gt;&gt; s = ezsheets.Spreadsheet(url_of_your_google_sheet) &gt;&gt;&gt; s.title 'Class Data Spreadsheet' &gt;&gt;&gt; s.sheets[0].get(row, column) 'Text in the cell' &gt;&gt;&gt; s.sheets[0].update(row, column, newValue) Documentation isn't up yet, but should be by next week. This is paired with my earlier EZGmail, which makes using the Gmail API easy: https://github.com/asweigart/ezgmail

Data recording you could use Googles own Drive API: [https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python) &amp;#x200B; this way, you can use google sheets, and when you want to tabulate data on your own, you can. If you do use a screen, use something like this:[https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-7-Touchscreen-Display/dp/B0153R2A9I/ref=sr\_1\_3?keywords=raspberry+pi+screen&amp;qid=1550009238&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-7-Touchscreen-Display/dp/B0153R2A9I/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=raspberry+pi+screen&amp;qid=1550009238&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3) What I would do, is to implement a stack to monitor the information, and write a simple pygame implementation to show the graph on screen. That would be cool. &amp;#x200B;
I just want to say, having read a lot of your comments in this thread, that independent of the rightness or wrongness of what you're saying, I find the way you're saying it to be sneering, condescending, disrespectful, and belittling of those you're addressing - and as a result I respect you and your opinions less than I might otherwise have done.

it's logically equivalent and not any less legible. it's fine. the better question is why the person asked the original question at all
reddit can make any community become a toxic mess... sadly.
Ironically I just started a hangman game after a comment from another post in /r/learnpython once it's up an running I'll post it up. Writing it on my phone at the moment
To be fair... When I was starting to program I did LPTHW and that was probably the most valuable thing it taught me.
Every time LPTHW is mentioned here and in r/learnpython the top comments are consistently recommending against it. I would argue that such prevalent sentiment from the community amounts to more than a "few" discouraging you. I would also point out that it is literally the *only* book that gets such a reaction. That being the case, I would advise doing a little research into the complaints (check the sidebar here, or scan through other comments) people have about it and thinking about whether they are relevant to your approach to learning. Personally, LPTHW was my first resource as a beginner programmer/pythonista, and I whole-heartedly agree with the prevailing sentiment in the Python community, that it's pretty easily the worst of the bunch. I hated it thoroughly. YMMV, best of luck.

Catching up on my backlog of work for [InstrumentKit](https://github.com/Galvant/InstrumentKit) I just picked up Effective Python by Slatkin so I'm working my way through that. One of my goals this year is to try to do some more professional development reading.
Check out u/Runew0lf too, same username on twitch, he live codes Python on stream as well.
The Python Cookbook is so fucking cool. Not good for beginners, but amazing for intermediates+.
Super cool. Thanks for putting this out there, I'm going to have to give it a spin.

Thanks again. I bought the book so I’m definitely not just going to discard it because of the Reddit community. I have researched the bashing of this book yet I still decided to give it a whirl. So far, I enjoy the approach of the book making me do the work in order to learn. I have a long road ahead of me and I plan to take several approaches to this subject. It’s my first language and my first attempt at coding. 
`iptables` is going to be your friend. The simple approach would be to DNAT to your application, and then have your application go to the original destination. This *will* change the source IP to the client, however. There's also `tproxy` which can be used in conjunction with `iptables` to do IP spoofing, but you really shouldn't do IP spoofing unless you need to. Also, if the two interfaces are on the same layer 2 network, then you'll need to make a bridge of the two and pick traffic off of that.
Cookbook is an excellent second book, once you have the fundamentals down. Opens you up to a whole new world of elegant, efficient, idiomatic Python constructs and solutions.
I would personally pick a language that is easy to export once compiled. If you are looking for something "relatively simple like python " to build an app for a store, you have to pick a store first. C# is great for Windows Java/Kotlin are great for Android Swift is great for IOS. -I really don't like apple, but I have to say... Swift is bonkers and its relatively easy to learn compared to smthing like C++. Also on the plus side, if you have a ma book ( which I do not recommend buying if you don't plan to become a pro swift dev), it comes with Xcode which is a absolutely gorgeous and full fledge Ide litteraly tailored for swift. - I'd use Kotlin over java for android because its easier to write, has insane perfs and can be used to output java code -C# is also quite pleasent to write but Microsoft store is disgusting. TLDR : pick a compiled language, and if you can't make a pick, Kotlin is a better java and Swift is really simple and pleasent to write. 
Disclaimer: not American(if that is the jurisdiction you develop under) or a lawyer. I looked a quickie at the licenses for pyqt and pyside. Pyside allows for proprietary software development if that is what you want to partake in. Pyqt is licenced under GNU GPL, so you can sell the software, but it has to be licensed under the GNU GPL or another suitably free software license. I'm a bit of a stallmanist on this so I'll have to recommend you go with pyqt or other free software for whatever you are developing as it would not be ethical to use a non-free license. But that's just opinion, but you will have to live under my anonymous terrifying gaze for the rest of your life if you do ;)
You can sell an application made with PySide as long as you also provide the source code for any changes that you made to PySide itself. You can't sell an application made with PyQt, unless you buy a commercial license from its developer.
AtBS is broadly similar, but focuses on more small projects rather than a few large ones. AtBS is the most frequently recommended beginner resource on r/learnpython (which is a fucking fantastic subreddit) these days, so you've done well to pick it up.
Poetry is good and pipenv is bad /s Poetry is a distribution tool as well as a dependency manager, where pipenv is just the latter. Poetry's dependency resolution algorithm is much faster, last time I checked. I think I've seen more people try pipenv than poetry, but of people who've said they tried both, I think I've seen more people stick with poetry. It's worth reading a few of the many blog posts comparing them.
Pytest 4+ was released before 2019; 3.5 is from April 2018. This comes across as a lazy listicle.
Thanks! will take a look
I'm glad Haskell books don't begin with that explanation for a Monad. 
Codecademy gets a lot of shit on reddit (and I agree that their price structure is a little steep), but I totally agree with this recommendation. I First first weeks(or week) also gets you Pro access which lets you into the Python 3 course(yeah, anything but 2 is behind a paywall). It’s good for a taste of programming, and their built-in debugger is great early on. ...that said, I’m in the middle of MITx 600 (Intro to programming with Python) and it’s vastly superior in terms of learning to structure code and build in a logical way. Tough as nails for this newbie, but satisfying in a Dark Souls way. Still, Codecademy smoothed the ride for the first two weeks.
I am currently in [MITx 600](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python-0)— Intro to programming with Python and it’s been amazing. Free or a fee for a certificate (and your fee supports MITx/EDx, so it’s a nice thing to do). Fast paced, cool and challenging exercises that force you to think and learn to structure your programs. 3 weeks in, and I’ve gone from total newb to building efficient little stand-alone programs for household stuff like “what do I need to pay monthly to pay off a credit card with balance x, APR of y, in z number of months. The pros on here can probably handle that in 2 or 3 lines, it in quite happy with the progress and how much I’ve learned in the course. Might be late to jump in now (though it’s free, so why not?) but I think a new one starts in a month or two. 
That's awesome! Can I recommend that you also use this opportunity to learn and use some project-related tools and processes? This part can be just as challenging as the actual coding, and it will serve you really well in the future if you take it seriously. * Do you have a plan for managing the project and dividing the work? I would perhaps start with a simple Trello board with 3 categories: To Do, Doing, and Done. Meet in-person with the team once a week to update tasks and plan for the next week. When team members find bugs or have new ideas, put them on the board and assign them as time permits. * Make sure that every person on the team has something that they "own". That might be a part of code, art, sounds, testing, app store, project management, whatever. If everyone will be coding then you might want to pair up at times to figure out an important piece together, or try to break off independent chunks so that one person is not blocking others. * Do you have a plan for how you will share code and collaborate across the 4 people? Learning Git and using GitHub is free and is a very valuable skill, and the standard way to work on code with other people. * Write a design doc for the game, including things like gameplay, story/characters, art, sound, and user interface. Write this together in Google Docs, include any links to inspiration, similar games, and what tools you will use for code and assets. Discuss in person and make sure everyone is in-board. This can and will change over time, but it's good to start off on the same page. Include some drawings of how you want the game to look. * Come up with some target milestones, so that you know if you are generally on-track or not. You have ~6 months. ** Month 1 have first version of design doc done, GitHub repo and Trello board setup, and everyone with accounts. Decide on language and framework, and research tools for art and sound. Everyone should have their editor (I would recommend PyCharm) setup, and be able to write a simple program and run it, and know how to submit code to GitHub. ** Month 2 prototype. Get a bare app running on laptop. Display character on screen. Move it move on player input. Make a menu with buttons. Play a sound. ** Month 3 basic gameplay. Core gameplay loop in place. Add enemies. Placeholder art. Get it running on mobile emulator for android. ** Month 4 beta version complete. complete gameplay, add features, improve art &amp; ui, add touch controls, support different resolutions. ** Month 5 testing and stretch goals. add iOS support. add unit tests. play the game. improve it. fix bugs. ** Month 6 launch on appstore. get feedback. fix bugs.

Of course, it certainly will get the job done so I wouldn't recommend tossing it out if you bought it haha. Just be aware that the 'hard way' really does apply literally here; it's more difficult to *learn* with this book than worth most others, and not necessarily the way the author intends. If you like a little extra challenge it should suit you, and if you already know some programming in another language it will be a breeze.
I’m reading along with doing a crash course online.

I just got through section 1 [(chapters 1 - 11) of python crash course. Very good book to start with!
From a CS purist perspective, when you’re writing a program to accomplish some business problem, you should be focused on the business problem itself and not the implementation details. Designing your architecture should be separate from the implementation details. Let’s say you have a business requirement to code against a REST API. When you’re planning the implementation, you’d like as little coupling as possible between components in your solution. To that end you might have methods get, put, post,..., that provide an abstraction to sending the actual http/tcp requests. Or maybe a higher level abstracted interface that mirrors the actual REST calls. These abstractions allow you to have a simple view of interactions with the remote server - perhaps even allowing you to ignore that it’s a REST service. If the underlying service changes from REST to some new API, you have a single layer to change and all your code that depends on it remains unchanged and able to work. This works because you made a contract for the interface and ignored the implementation. If instead you knew it was REST and under that TCP and exposed exposed TCP parameters or methods and/or details of REST in your API, then you’d have more trouble I’d REST or TCP got switched out - because code outside that layer is infected with knowledge of the implementation. When your teacher says you shouldn’t know how the code works, I suspect they mean that your code shouldn’t depend on the implantation details, the internals, of how the library is implemented. As almost a separate topic, you’re trying to advance your development skills. A good way to do that is by reading other people’s code. Or, you don’t understand a feature in a library based on the docs - another good time to look in the code. You’re a programmer. Your currency is code. Never feel like you shouldn’t look at code your working with or depend on. And don’t be intimidated by the code - it’s just code. Focus is a developers friend. Abstraction helps with reducing code coupling, but also helps us focus on areas that need it and ignore areas that don’t. You can’t dive down into code for every library you use and still complete your project in a timely manner. 
Thanks for sharing! I can't wait to dive in

Gotcha, thanks for the reply!
Hey! I love the concept. Did exactly the same but with english articles and a different algorithm (if im not wrong) awhile back. You just motivated me to look into the tf-idf algorithm and I probably would implement it to my own summarizer. 
So it wasnt working in my main code, so I tried it out by itself. I did, \`\`\` wins = gotWin(wins) def gotWin(wins): wins += 1 return wins \`\`\` And got the error, "NameError: name 'gotWin' is not defined" So I tried putting the "wins = gotWin(wins)" after the function, and it gave me the error, "NameError: name 'wins' is not defined" Any ideas on how to fix? &amp;#x200B;
What is it? 
It really is a complex game.
&gt; You can't sell an application made with PyQt, unless you buy a commercial license from its developer. That's not 100% correct. You *can* sell an application if you license your code under the GPL as well. Which of course would mean that whoever buys it, is allowed to make copies (and make derivative works), and sell them to. Only if you don't want to publish your work under the GPL (which is probably the case), you'd have to buy a commercial license.

Thanks! It was my first NLP project and I really liked working on it. After a week of tweaks and fixes I liked the results that I was getting. My motivation was to get it right and usable.
On one hand I think \`node\_modules\` "got it right" and virtualenvs are a kludge to paper over the fact that \`\_\_pypackages\_\_\` has been missing this whole time.That said, I think the important part isn't the mechanism, it's the tooling. If you have something like "pipenv except it doesn't suck ass" then you don't really need to change the backing mechanism.
polish got me... I can help if you want to
Sorry I think I didn't make myself clear. I'm actually looking for an ML/NLP package that us able to identify salient keywords and return them from a block of text.
I will put some other options out there. I love Python, but honestly it's not great for making games. Yes, it can be done but for whatever reason the Python tools for making games just aren't that great. * Build a 'hybrid' app using HTML5 and package it as a phone app. This uses web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build a web app, and then tooling such as [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) or [Capacitor](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/) to package it for distribution on the app store. This is a very good option, there are many mobile companies making apps this way and the tools are solid. Learning Javascript and HTML will be very useful if you already know C++ and Python and ever want to get into web development. * LibGDX with Java or Kotlin. If you already know C++ and Python then you should be able to pick either of these languages up quite fast. LibGDX is a cross-platform game framework and I think it's better for making games than something like Kivy, but it's still quite low level. * Unity with C#. If you are serious about making games then Unity is an obvious choice. This is a heavy-duty framework that is used in many big-budget games, but is also free. However, a lot of Unity development tends to be done in the Unity UI, and not by writing code. If this is for a school CS project, I don't think it would be a good choice.
Anyone else remember when blogs were personal and writers had to pay for hosting? Was that better than monetization platforms where people just copy/paste other peoples work?
You need to start with a value for wins. Make a simple program with only this in it... def gotWin(wins): return wins + 1 wins = 0 print wins for x in range(5): wins = gotWin(wins) print(wins) If you don't have the `wins = 0` (or some other number) line, then when you call `wins = gotWin(wins)`, it tries to pass a non-existent value to the function gotWin().

I find the foreign language ones most surprising. I mean, Spanish, French, sure. But then Arabic and Dutch?
So, if there's no change on the PySide code I don't need to provide my own source code. Is that right?

You also don't need to if you made changes. You'll only have to provide the source code of your changes. What you can't do is, eg. modify PySide so that it will show ads every 10 seconds, providing the source to these changes to comply with that requirement of the LGPL, but then write your own program such that it refuses to run if somebody removes the ads from your PySide version. In other words, unless you go out of your way to be an asshole, you won't need to provide the source of your program if it uses a LGPL library

Cursors are easy though...

Not sure if python is the way to go. If you need performance, I would pick C. 
&gt; assuming you're not trying to abuse them Thats all i do with Sql XD. Jokes aside thats the part i had most problems in my life , triggers were (to me) x10 times easier than cursors , even building databases from scratch felt easier than cursors. 
Best way to answer that question is to whip up a PoC and run it through a load test to see what performance you can get. Also somewhat impossible to answer without knowing far more intimate details about what you're building. No idea what cost there is server-side there is per call, how many servers you have, if you're architecting it to be able to scale horizontally, etc etc etc. &gt; just use WebSockets Apparently django-channels uses WebSockets.

Not sure if this helps but you can program a PID-controller so your light intensity for example automatically approximates the set-point you want (maybe you already know this stuff.. if you don't, just google PID-controller.. it's quite simple).

Wow, a game that took like years to even reach high level in-game match making make it to the list? Big surprise. I learned statistics, calculus and deep learning and find out it only take me 4 hours pep day in a year. Meanwhile it took me 3 years to gind from 1k to 4k on the maximum of 10k in the system. So you can imagine
try looking at the ```nltk``` module. You run tfidf on the text to extract "key" words. I guess you'll have define what a keyword is like.
Thought of a program that will help me at work but have no idea where to start... so I bought codeacademy.... help is much appreciated The program needs to generate printable documents based off an excel spreadsheet. The excel spreadsheet is a list of products and what their sizes, materials, etc needs to be. I like to include picture snippets from specs to include on items that it applies to. Any thoughts ?

Just look up raspberry pi weather station. You’ll see hundred of project blogs. Basically the hardware is rasp pi or Arduino connected to temp, humidity, barametic presure sensors. All of those sensors have python libraries that make access super easy. As far as the work goes. Use python to read the sensors and append the data to log.txt file. Depending on how complicated you need to be, you can use python to send the data to the web. All of this is documented in the various blog posts.
Why didn't I think of nesting them?!?!
): why so mean
Because if we're just moving `lib/site-packages` into the project's source root, that's pointless. If we're copying the behavior of Node, then it's stupid. `node_modules` is awesome in theory but awful in practice. It doesn't do dependency resolution at all, instead every module you install it installs all if its dependencies, and all the dependencies' dependencies. All the way down. You could have 100 versions of the same `requests` library if each layer had a few versions. Python libraries are more closely tied to the interpreter than JS libraries. Any compiled module has to run on an interpreter that was built with the same toolchain. Besides, the motivation bullet points are moot. 1) Not good for newbies? Doesn't matter. 2) Workshop participation confusion? Doesn't matter. 3) Virtual environments tied to a terminal session? Doesn't matter.
When calculated? You’ll probably memory error first.
Pip-tools is just enough extras for me. I can manage the rest and prefer it to the workflows that the packaging authority(who I believe just one day said they were the authority) come up with.
How yould you export an environment? Something like requirements.txt
You would specify your dependencies anyway, then use that spec to populate `__pypackages__`.
Yeah but PyPA likes pipenv... so...
I actually learned about a few new libraries, a rarity with these lists. Not just, "requests, OMG!"
I don't think drawing is teachable though...
&gt; It doesn't do dependency resolution at all, instead every module you install it installs all if its dependencies, and all the dependencies' dependencies. All the way down. You could have 100 versions of the same requests library if each layer had a few versions. I assume this is to allow libraries with clashing version constraints to play together? Python currently doesn't allow multiple versions of the same library in the same environment and it would have to change a fair bit to allow that, so it's likely that `__pypackages__` would do exactly the same dependency resolution we already have. &gt; If you're developing a scientific library that has to run on every version of Python3 it doesn't make sense to have a single __pypackages__, every version will need its own compiled copy of the dependencies. This is covered in the PEP - the packages are all namespaced to the python version. 
I hate it. Venvs are better and more powerful, usability of venvs just maybe needs to be improved somewhat. One of the great things about venvs is that once you've activated them, it doesn't matter where you are. You can run stuff as `python -m mypackage.stuff` or import it in the interpreter, whatever you like (assuming you've done an `--editable` install of mypackage). But with `__pypackages__` it looks like you'd need to navigate to the `mypackage/` directory in order to import it, since from what I understand that's where the `__pypackages__` directory would need to be to use `stuff.py` as a script in the above example. And what if you had a deeply nested package structure and wanted to run, say `python -m mypackage.util.something`? Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems like this wouldn't even work without having another `__pypackages__` directory. If people are having trouble learning venvs, then just teach them to do `pip install --user`. I think this `__pypackages__` would be more tricky to use properly than either `--user` installs or even venvs. Personally, I [use](https://github.com/benburrill/dotfiles/blob/master/common/bin/inve) a small inve-style script to activate, search for, and create venvs. It's very straight-forward to use: `inve --make` makes and enters a venv in a new shell, installing default dependencies from `~/.venv.pip`, and with a simple bash alias, history is preserved from the parent shell. I wish `venv` had something of similar convenience builtin, as I, like the author of this PEP, am not a big fan of the activate dance. But this PEP is not the answer to venv usability problems, and adds another "way to do it" for no reason. 
I've been thinking for a while about a project similar to (Cookiecutter)[1] but with a few differences: * Hosted, public template index similar to NPM, Rubygems, or Sublime Package Control * Higher quality, more complete documentation * Better support for ongoing file generation instead of focusing only on new project generation I started working on v1 last weekend and I'm continuing to work on it this week. Hoping to release something in the next few weeks. If anyone is interested in something like this, feel free to ping me and let me know what you think. [1]: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter

&gt; And how do you think people doing the following know what it is they are following? Just like my cat follows the regulations of UN. She doesn't need to understand them or even know they exist. In other words, they don't know. Knowing is a kind of activity that is very foreign to what their brains do. Daniel Dennett calls this "competence without comprehension". These people appear to be doing something that seems very much like it would require a lot of knowledge, but they don't have mental access to their brain faculties which execute the part that's responsible for the knowledge. Or often times, the knowledge part is not even in people themselves. It's like the fact that any, even the most stupid, human can produce the best general AI that programming could come up with so far: by giving birth. &gt; A lot of the most popular libraries and patterns have been designed or described by just some dude who knew how to communicate. And a lot of them weren't. And a lot of them are outright garbage. There is no correlation between tolerance for idiots and quality of ones code. But I didn't even claim that my code is so much better. All I said is that I know how to make it better. I also said, that I have to use the garbage like Python -- that cannot make anyone's code good. Good code needs to be written in a good language. My code is about fixing other bad code. So, it's not good. It's probably even worse than the code it's intended to fix, especially because my starting condition was a lot worse than of the person writing the code that I'm fixing.

Actually it is. Then there wouldn't be any art schools
aiohttp or tornado should be able to do it
`node_modules` is a horrible idea. JavaScript is probably one of the unique languages whose infrastructure is even worse than that of Python, if that's humanly possible. Virtual environments in Python didn't solve the problem, only some % of it. `__pypackages__` solve even a smaller %. Here's for example one thing that `__pypackages__` doesn't solve: your scripts that after you install your package into virtual environment you could have used by just typing the name will not be accessible to you anymore because `__pypackages__` doesn't influence your environment.
My God, they've gone to plaid.

You should not make programs which depend on two versions of the same library. If you did this, it's a bug in your code that you need to fix. An environment which allows you to have two different versions of the same library is a bad one. In other words, your argument sounds like an attempt to defend a drunk driver who was involved in an accident by claiming that being drunk is an excuse, since the drivers senses had been clouded. &gt; This is covered in the PEP - the packages are all namespaced to the python version. No, they aren't. People who write the PEP don't understand the requirements (as this is usually the case with Python). What I need in my daily life is virtual environment for Python I compiled for debugging, with Python I compiled with MinGW, for python I compiled with defines limiting its functionality, for Python I compiled from the HEAD. All of these may, technically have the same version, but all of them do different things.
Nice, they have 3.7 available. I was fighting to get 3.7 working via conda in their build image a month or two ago.
Making a Python shell to replace bash, called pysh. Apparently lots of people have had this idea before, with the same name, but those projects all seem abandoned. Anyway, the idea is that it's a normal Python interpreter, but with special syntax to call down into the system. \`backticks\` evaluate to the output of the command inside them, while a line starting with a \\backslash is run as a subprocess. You can use f-string-style expression interpolation inside these too! Also, there's a decorator that lets you chain functions with `|` like so: `read("foo.txt") | grep("bar") | joinlines`. I'm planning to make it lazy at some point, but I'm not sure what the best way of doing it would be. There are some design tradeoffs I haven't considered. Tonight I added support for transpiling and importing arbitrary pysh scripts, taking it from just a shell to a proper shell language!
I suppose its one of those "learn what you need, when you need it" skills, like baking and hostage negotiation.
I don't think the person above you was suggesting to depend on two versions of the same library.
You were close, but the best game ever created is actually Super Mario Bros. 2. That's why it's won game of the year every year since 1989.
For a perfect abstraction, it doesn't matter how it works and learning how it works is a waste of brain space. Unfortunately, [there are no perfect abstractions that do anything worthwhile.](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/) It's okay not to know how code you're importing works, but when it leaks you'll be forced to figure it out. So it's not so much that you *shouldn't* know, but rather you *shouldn't have to* know. 
It's a bold move, [Python 3 has] caught on.
Check out repository managers like Sonatype Nexus and JFrog Artifactory. They make hosting your own PyPI absolutely trivial. I believe Nexus OSS is free and supports PyPI format.

Hey. Like most NLP tasks, it depends on what you have and what you want. A good point to start is probably the tf-idf score (No we are not talking about the Israeli military here). It makes use of the fact that important words in a document are most likely frequent in this document and rare in others. In from sklearn.feature\_extraction.text you find the CountVectorizer and Transformer. They are really handy. &amp;#x200B; There is on big problem that you are going to run into. You use a Bag of Words approach, that means you neglect all positional information you have on your obs: Many terms however you are interested will consist of more than one token, for example New York Stock Exchange. If this is important to you, first have to use some sequence to sequence labelling algorithm, like a Hidden Markov model (HMM), Conditional Random Fields (CRF) or a Recurrent Neural Net. The technical term in NLP you are looking for is Named Entity Recognition. &amp;#x200B; If you can describe your task a bit more detailed I might be able to give you more directed advice.

Working on data visualization in Python 
Please, for the love of god, it’s “number of actions”. Amount is used when you can’t really quantify something, like that’s a large amount of snow. 
Yeah, the graph/data is very poorly presented.
I really prefer the PQLs
Working on a PL/SQL package parser with RE in order to make a Notepad++ autocompletion file which basically is a xml that Notepad++ reads in, providing autocompletion for public constants, functions, procedures. ... When I’m finished I can run my script after every git update, and have a nice, customized auto-completion in my favourite PL/SQL IDE, Notepad++ :) Pretty sure that others in my company will use it too!
U the real mvp 
It effectively just standardizes the existing virtualenv setup into a standard location that is automatically installed to and looked up from to avoid the need to activate it. For anyone who organizes their venv into a project-local `.venv` folder, the name changes somewhat and your life gets easier by not having to activate the venv. Also cross version interop becomes easier because you just `pythonX -m pip install foo` or whatnot to swap between versions. tbh my hot take is that its a pretty easy win and im not sure i understand the negative comments.
Why not use their TOTP app?
I'm interested in understanding more about the crawler.
At the moment, there’s pipenv, poetry, and flit. I suggest to use one of the latter two, since they use the standard pyproject.toml and [pipenv has problems](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry#what-about-pipenv). I mainly use flit because it’s dead simple and (if you install keyring) it remembers your PyPI password, but if you want to have more security regarding locked dependency versions, poetry is probably better for you. &amp;#x200B;
so you just took someone else's code and you're looking for help with it, even though you know nothing about Python, right? Sounds silly and you should be ashamed. Also, this is not thw reddit for that, /r/learnpython is the onw
Bokeh? [https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/)
Well damn :/ Sorry
Flask is far from "big". Definitely use a web framework, you don't want to be doing raw HTTP over sockets pretty much ever. I'd maybe even use an async framework like Quart here - it should handle lots of IO way better.
This seems like an awful lot of work on the SQLAlchemy front that could much more easily be solved by Pandas and a simple SELECT statement. Suppose we run the following: df = ( pd.read_sql("SELECT date_created, user_id FROM Action", engine) .set_index(['date_created']) ) for the purposes of demonstration, we generate dummy data with: df = pd.DataFrame( index=( pd.date_range(start='2019-03-01', periods=1000, freq='h') + pd.to_timedelta(np.random.randint(1, 30, 1000), unit='T') ).rename('date_created'), data={ 'user_id': np.random.randint(1, 6, 1000), 'action': 'blah' } ) With `df` populated with data and a DateTime index, resampling is super easy: ( df .resample('D') .action .count() ) With a little effort, you can also create a chart of the total logins by day for each user: ( df .groupby([ pd.Grouper(freq='D'), pd.Grouper(key='user_id') ]) .count() .unstack(level='user_id') # Unpivot the user_id to be the columns .sort_index(axis=1) # Reorder the user_ids .action # Drop the `action` index level .plot(stacked=True) # Plot the results ) 
Hi badge! My apologies. I've included the code as a text now! Was in a hurry when i left the office, hence attached an image (and in addition i'm new to the reddit page). Your assistance is greatly appreciated :)
Flask is the right library for simple applications. The HTTP spec might be difficult to parse properly, and has quite a lot of edge cases. Flask is lightweight and simple to use, and parses POST bodies just fine.
First, checkout /r/learnpython for questions like this. Python uses single-step prefixes for strings to describe special strings. The f prefix declares the string to be a format string, and the variables in braces will be expanded when the string is evaluated. Without the f it's just a normal string.
yeah, you are right, it's partly remote job. What you mean is "fully" remote

It's kind of very easy. scrapy or requests to get data from website then extract what you want. Store them into database. The key here is choosing aws lambda to run crawlers. 30 crawlers, once per hour, the total cost of one month is less than 1 dollar. compared with the server for elastic search or others , it's negligible.
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!

Just an FYI the terminology is "count noun" vs "mass noun." "Amount of &lt;mass noun&gt;" and "number of &lt;count noun&gt;" (same with less/fewer). Sadly, desperately sadly, the only people who seem to bother with language in public today bother with it in [quite the wrong way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7E-aoXLZGY).

str is used to convert the number into a string. The sample solution does that because it uses string concatenation instead of proper formatting for constructing the output (even simple \`print(name, "will be 100 years old in the year", year)\` would be much better IMO and would work without the need to convert year to a string). The "f" indicates an f-string, which is Python's relatively new way of string formatting. Python has different ways to format strings: * % operator, which uses syntax like C's printf function: "Dear %s, in %d you will be 100 years old!" % (name, year) * .format() method: "Dear {}, in {} you will be 100 years old!".format(name, year) * f-string: f"Dear {name}, in {year} you will be 100 years old!" See [https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/) for more detail, and the advantages/disadvantages of each approach. &amp;#x200B;
I feel like if I have to relocate then it's not really "remote." Just has "work from home" as an occasional perk.

This is the way I see it. We have so many ways of virtualization, because there isn't one way. Like the black package. It don't do everything with code formatting that I would like, but the advantages of commonality is greater than my little concerns. Virtual environments are a hot mess for new users of Python. If we can batteries include this so all scripts work the same, it is a big win.
The problems raised by the blogger is anti-pattern, not exceptions. For example, in his `divide` function example, it's completely wrong to catch and bury the 'divided by zero' exception in the function. The function should raise the exception to the caller. A 'divided by zero' exception is just an exception, either fix it or crash the program (though there are other kinds of exception should be caught and processed).
So you just check in your __pycache__ folders currently?
I agree with you, the author seems very confused. Even by just reading the first few lines: 1. That function is not type safe, it's called 'type hints' for a reason 2. Spotting all possible runtime errors by looking at the code is close to impossible and useless. That's what testing ia for.
Right! Exactly, but instead he makes a system to state that the function will raise an exception. Why not just a `docstring`?
&gt; [...] to see the progress of the proposal and wish him the worst? 
Thank you...I have the same problem. I had downgraded Spyder but it crashes sometimes. When I downgraded ANACONDA to the version you told us, everything is working properly. &amp;#x200B; Thanks.

To wish does not imply having to transmit it
I think he's just pushing really hard to promote his library, but the examples he provides are too simplistic. I can see it being useful in a large code base, and the patterns followed were against clean code (large functions that do more than one thing). Again there is still `docstrings`. &amp;#x200B;
The author apparently likes Haskell's Either monad better than Python's exceptions. He fails to give any clear reason why it's objectively better, though. And replacing Python's standard error handling mechanism that every Python programmer knows well with something else just because the author subjectively likes it better is definitely a terrible idea.
For karma?
That page is really cool! I'm looking to get into bokeh myself for some work stuff.
Author read the /r/rust book for 10 minutes and now is enlightened
Looks like johnny5!
it's most reliable when used in jupyter. i've hit problems running the bokeh server standalone - i wouldn't use that in production unless you're pretty relaxed about uptime etc.
Agree, Thanks for clarifying that.
I know it is not the solution you look for, but it makes me wonder, since you don't consider whitespace as a character, would doing this: 1+&lt;trillions of spaces&gt;1 Make my program run longer? If so, then you are only limited by memory
but then you're explicitly encoding your database structure in code related to data processing. using sqlalchemy might (dpending on details) save you from some of that (for example, it will automatically join to the users table if needed). also, most of that sqlalchemy query is converted into SQL - it's not processing happening at the python level - so it's not particularly inefficient (sqlalchemy *can* be inefficient, if you are creating objects, but it also has ways to avoid that).
Are talking about [this blog post](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2011/12/7/thoughts-on-python3/)? Because that feels like a reasonable, opinionated article from an accomplished python developer. It's not even focusing on Python 3 itsellf, it's more about the painful transition and all the headaches that come with it. **from 2011** Zed Shaw's article wasn't only hilariously wrong, it was mostly ramblings about tiny things blown out of proportion **from 2016**
I like that approach, thanks for sharing. I guess I'm more used to arranging data on the SQL side, but I'll definitely play with this!
The problem there is that virtualization is a hot mess because there is no "one size" fits all solution. It very likely will be the same with __pypackages__. The biggest "wonk" I have with virtual environments is that tools including idle, jupyter, and most ides have to be mucked with to work in a virtual environment. Maybe pypackages will simplify that--but as with any complex system it (like all the venv solutions) is likely going to just open a world of more unintended consequences and issues. I personally love virtualenvwrapper because it (to me) simplifies virtual environments and if needed lets you fully customize how an environment is created and customize how a specific environment is run. Not sure how doing something like `cd projects/my_code/` is any better than `workon my_code`. It may actually really help some things--but it also seems like it is going to just end up adding a new layer of potential confusion. 
agreed, it's the project that have multiple dependency that have different working version of the library

No but I grumble at everything extra I have to add to it. It's annoying having to maintain your `.ignore` as well as everything else.
This is interesting, and valuable given that the author of pandas has wanted to rewrite it from the ground up for some time ([some discussion about it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/8rcoou/what_happened_to_pandas_2/)). A perspective on which parts of the API people actually "need" reduces the surface area to be reimplemented.
Thank you! I get it now! 
Thanks for your help! 
what error message did you receive? do you have the bext library installed?
If you dont get it it says hip hip in an array
We got it, still kinda stupid when coupled with your comments.
I love sqlalchemy, but its strength is not writing queries that do a lot of data manipulation--and as you point out in this case, your function isn't dialect agnostic because `extract` is Postgres-specific. It's not useful in this example, but structure I use a lot where you have 'header' tables that map to detail tables (think `Report`, `ReportDetail`) is adding a property into the `Report` class that uses `sqlalchemy.orm.session.object_session` to fetch the session (and engine) that any instances are using. Then you can run arbitrary queries on without creating masses of potentially unnecessary class instances:

&gt; You should not make programs which depend on two versions of the same library. If you did this, it's a bug in your code that you need to fix. An environment which allows you to have two different versions of the same library is a bad one. Right, and that's exactly what I said. Node does that, it's bad; python does not do that currently, and there's no reason to expect that it will with `__pypackages__`. Your argument that any attempt to pick up one of node's good qualities must necessarily include all of its bad qualities doesn't stand, IMO. &gt; What I need in my daily life is... That's fair, for your specific purposes. I suspect that of all python development environments in the world, those like yours are a very small minority, and will still be adequately served by `venv`, or a possibly tool like `tox`.
Im aware its just very close
I work in tech, but not in software dev. Itd be nice to understand how to use Python with API's. Do you think I could still learn by skipping ahead in the book to the API section? I've also been watching MIT Python lectures as a helpful guide.
I GET IT! Hip Hip Array! I gotchu fam. Great yolk
It really isn’t, the article used incorrect amount incorrectly, and my example usage of amount was correct. You can also say “large mass of snow”, but amount is equally correct. A quick google should clear up your confusion....
Under the hood, isn't a list just an array of PyObjects?
Well, Haskell's monadic error handling is, IMHO, much better than Python exceptions. And he seems pretty clear to me about the reasons; all of his critiques of Python exceptions are real problems that you don't have with Maybe / Either in Haskell. OTOH, that's *Haskell's* monadic error handling, which simply doesn't work the way he wants in Python, library and type hints notwithstanding. So this comparison devolves into a Haskell vs. Python comparison, which is a lot less straightforward. As one example, he criticizes the fact that a network call can fail for a pile of different reasons that aren't adequately described by a non-trivial exception (network down, server down, auth, wrong endpoint, etc.) But in Haskell, many of these are handled not by Either / Maybe, but by IO. And IO has many of the same problems with respect to unpredictable error handling; the main advantage is that you can fence off the unpredictability better with IO, at the cost of a lot of hassle. Since Python doesn't hassle you the way Haskell does, you don't get the benefit of that fencing in Python, either. Which is part of why his library doesn't really solve the problems with Python exceptions. Is Python's no-hassle policy better than Haskell's safety? (Heh. Let's not have that flame war, er, debate here; suffice it to say that barriers to entry are important and valuable problems to solve.)
I would be surprised if it was an array of PyObject - it should be an array of pointers to PyObject. Back in Pythonland, given there's a standard library component named "array", saying a list is an array is highly confusing.

I HAVE A GODDAMN SOVIET UNION PIN PINNED INTO MY DESKTOP PC, DO NOT TRY TO UNDERMINE SUCH POWER
The house always wins... Sounds interesting!
Yes, a list is a dynamically expanding array under the hood
I tend to put such things into `.git/info/exclude`. At least does not need to be a checked-in part of the repository. I wish more people would use that. Everybody's favourite editor's .dotfile exclusions in one .gitignore.. fun.

This is what I worry about with something like this. https://xkcd.com/927/
 &gt;turtle.tracer(n=None, delay=None) &gt;Parameters: &gt;n – nonnegative integer &gt;delay – nonnegative integer &gt;Turn turtle animation on/off and set delay for update drawings. If n is given, only each n-th regular screen update is really performed. (Can be used to accelerate the drawing of complex graphics.) Second argument sets delay value (see delay()). 
Go for it. If you’re not interested in the certificate this round, jump in for some practice. If you want something more casual, Codecademy gives you free access to their Python 3 course for a week or two which would give you a good intro. Their debugger is super useful, and gave me a good foundation for the MITx course. Good luck!
I'm not really against pypackages--maybe it would fix a lot of issues. However, conceptually it seems to be slightly odd for one reason. Essentially it is adding something to python itself to address a developer issue. All of the justifications for it are focused on developers--not the language. So the question becomes--is this going to end up being how python itself works? Will pypackage directories be exposed to end users or deployment environments? If not how will that be prevented? (On this front it seems for new users you are just kicking the can down the road.) If it will be exposed beyond dev environments (which it appears it would) it may just open a whole new can of worms and add more confusion. It seems like it is a rather large change--and again maybe it would end up being a really good change. BUT it is a change to address a developer annoyance. It seems it takes an idea from node/npm (the default install location "node_modules")--but python and node are very, very different (duh!) but particularly in how and where they are deployed. In short--it is a substantial change to python itself. It has the potential to really, really make things more confusing; but probably has the same potential to simplify things. Maybe it would be worth it just to end the bloodshed between the poetry and pipenv camps--but as a detente does it open the door for a much worse battle in Env War II? (Sorry, I almost have to end my posts with some idiotic thing.)
&gt; As one example, he criticizes the fact that a network call can fail for a pile of different reasons that aren't adequately described by a non-trivial exception (network down, server down, auth, wrong endpoint, etc.) How does that example make exceptions look bad? I would say that it is the beauty of exceptions in this case that that call can throw different exceptions for the different ways it can fail, and those can be handled different exception handles installed in the call stack - wherever it's most appropriate to handle each specific error case. How is jamming all that into a single failure type which has to be handled at a single place advantageous?
This is very cool! I also really liked your video presentation of it, very well done.
I agree
A subtitle downloader that uses [opensubtitles.org](https://opensubtitles.org) database. It's setup is a bit complicated (opensubtitles demands a registered user agent), but I intend to make it easier to use. The script is developer friendly, however. [https://github.com/rodrigovedovato/subtitlefinder](https://github.com/rodrigovedovato/subtitlefinder)
I'm quite annoyed that the `asyncio` example didn't use `aiohttp`. Here's an example that uses `asyncio`, `aiohttp`. #!/usr/bin/env python3 import asyncio import uuid import aiohttp async def get_url(url, session): # The original example is really stupid, why are we downloading all of these to the same file? # I'm too lazy to bother with anything else, so I'll just download these to some random file name. file_name = str(uuid.uuid4()) async with session.get(url) as response: with open(file_name, 'wb') as fd: async for data in response.content.iter_chunked(1024): fd.write(data) return f'Successfully downloaded {url} to file {file_name}' async def main(urls): async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session: tasks = [get_url(url, session) for url in urls] return await asyncio.gather(*tasks) urls = ["https://www.python.org/events/python-events/801/", "https://www.python.org/events/python-events/790/", "https://www.python.org/events/python-user-group/816/", "https://www.python.org/events/python-events/757/"] loop = asyncio.get_event_loop() results = loop.run_until_complete(main(urls)) print('\n'.join(results)) Much simpler, plus it makes way more sense. I don't think the example in the article does anything concurrently, for example. They wait on each coroutine in order, which is really annoying.
I think you're the one who misunderstands. I'm not telling you to use "a large mass of snow." I'm saying that "snow" is a "mass noun" and with mass nouns, the quantity descriptor are "mass descriptors" (e.g. less) as opposed to "count descriptors" (e.g. fewer). A quick Google on count/mass nouns should clear *you* up.
Thank you!
&gt;The state of the modern developer's blog is abysmal and you should just ignore them unless you &gt; have good reason not to, imo. He seems to promote experimental/provisional features as the next best thing, and to use external libraries. 
I figured he might have looked at Haskell or Rust and decided to do the same.
Exactly--hate to say it but fixing a developer issue is more of a 3rd party (IDE, poetry, pipenv, etc.) thing. Yes, it is a pain for new users but learning the intricacies of writing, managing, and deploying code is part of the landscape. 
Ask a Java developer what they think about checked exceptions if you want to see a grown professional break down and cry. This is overall something that typed languages have backed away from as a mistake - bringing it into a typed language like python is just asking for trouble.
Possibly that python *can* do everything, but doing anything *well* is almost always a case of importing a library which wraps a different language. Numpy, pandas and tensorflow as an example.
Interesting, hadn't heard of this before, ty!
It looks like a question asked on stackoverflaw regarding a python issue? It must be a really old question because it appears to be about python 2.7.
Is it normal that your code is embedded in HTML in your article? 
This feels like a reactionary "I don't like nodejs therefore all its ideas are bad" take. Basically, citation needed. I do agree though fwiw, that __pypackages__ doesn't put the stuff in ./ inside the import path (as compared to say python setup.py develop in your venv). In nodejs this isn't as big a deal because relative requires work fine - in python this isn't even possible so you're stuck.
It is asked today only. 
This has the same problem as checked exceptions in Java. In any decent-sized project, literally every line of code could in theory throw an exception. Java has to cheat somewhat and exclude things like out of memory errors from the checking system, but as a developer you still need to do things like close files properly even if a system exception kills your program. Systems like checked exceptions or this system just make you add overhead to all of your code to say "yes this is yet another method that could in theory cause an exception but probably won't".
I understand your but it doesn’t apply to what I said. It’s it correct to sa large amount (or mass) of snow. It is incorrect to say large amount of anything quantifiable. Your point, while accurate, is a digression.

One of my rules is to always try to provide a way to avoid the exception by checking first. In the case of divide it's a simple check but if it was more complicated you could have a method called candivide(x,y) or something that returns False if the division would have failed. Similarly if a method throws a Not Found exception when requesting an item it's helpful if there is a way to check if the item exists first. You want to have the actual method that returns the item to throw an exception though, because it makes it easier to catch bugs when the client code is lazy and doesn't bother checking.
Oh. You should probably try on r/learnpython then. And post your actual question--not a stuckinundertow link. Be concise, provide code, and ask questions regarding the actual problem/issue. If people have to guess what the problem is the answer is going to be you are using 2.7.

Hey man I get what you are saying. I will post my question in the suggested subreddit. Thanks for the suggestion. 
My Fav Book :)
&gt; What else can I do with API apart from mashing things together? Spoilers: that's literally all programming is. You take existing APIs and glue them together to do whatever specific task you have. It's APIs all the way down; your programming language is an API ( of sorts ) for interacting with the CPU, the hard disk, network devices, and so on. So, this is it. You're doing programming now. The easy part is learning syntax and stuff. The hard part is figuring out useful or fun projects to work on, and then following through on them. That's a personal journey.
Rust? Thought he read a Go book.
it's the people in the community, not the website
I have not tried it. Does that work around this issue?
I think so, although I am not sure I understand your actual issue. Here's some more information about `requests` and SSL errors: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10667960/python-requests-throwing-sslerror 
The issue is the one documented in the python bug report in the original post.
i think the single most "woah" moment for me was finding out how much geographic information is avaiilable. it's soooo detailed and publicly available. and services built on top of that like nominatim have incredibly powerful, simple syntax. you can search by city, street, address, region, neighborhood, common name, and more, and it just works.

No. Python is not Haskell and shouldn't try to be. 
Flask is the way to go.
It helps here to understand how Haskell monadic error handling with Either works, which requires an understanding of monads and other hairy topics. There's a fairly old write-up in the online book *Real World Haskell* that's still pretty good: [http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/error-handling.html](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/error-handling.html) Plus, there are lots of other discussions of monads and error handling in Haskell online. But to sum up: no, both Haskell's Either and the library mentioned in the post do not jam all failures into a single type, any more than Python does. Maybe and Either actually work a lot like Python exceptions. And yes, I agree that his example is not very compelling. As I mention in my comment, his library doesn't really fix the problem, because the problem follows from the way Python works, just as Either / Maybe's advantages follow from the way Haskell works. You can't fix this problem by slapping a library on top of it. You could fix it by making Python strongly-typed and by forcing all interactions with the outside world through a decorator (among other changes). But that really wouldn't be Python anymore; it would be a poorly-done Haskell, and since we have Haskell, why would you want that?
professionals use fuckit. [This module is like violence: if it doesn't work, you just need more of it.](https://github.com/ajalt/fuckitpy)
Can you name some nice free APIs?
I did: [Nominatim](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim)
Cool. Have you heard of [subliminal](https://github.com/Diaoul/subliminal)? It hasn't been updated since 2016 (!), but still works pretty well actually. I'm not sure which subtitle sources it uses. One tip is to not use bitly links in your GitHub readme. There's no need for shortened characters there and you can use Markdown link syntax, so it just feels sleazy like you want to see how many people click the link or something...
How did it get the last ten digits?
It seems as if Rust and Go take some inspiration from Haskell and how it handles errors. I guess those languages will eventually introduce more concepts from functional programming. &amp;#x200B;

I bet none of them had the word "alot" in them ;)
After playing with Bokeh, I was not satisfied with its interactive feature, for that PyEcharts is greatly more useful. 
Really nice! Apparently, it uses [different sources](https://github.com/Diaoul/subliminal/tree/master/subliminal/providers) (including some that don't offer a public API).
Well in that case I disagree with you, too: &gt; for example track the evolution of the amount of daily/weekly/monthly actions, and the evolution of active users. Seems like a perfectly good use of &gt; amount &gt; &gt; /əˈmount/ &gt; &gt; noun &gt; &gt; 1. a quantity of something, especially the total of a thing or things in number, size, value, or extent.
This is great!
The basic idea is like this: 9**1 = 9 9**2 = 81 9**3 = 729 . . 9**1073 = ...3929 You can see the last digit is always (9, 1, 9, 1, 9, 1...). This shows that every odd power of 9 ends in a 9 and every even power ends in a 1. This can be done for each power in the chain and you don't need to calculate the full number.
It took me a few seconds to get it, because at first I was like "hip, hip, hp"?
Can I join too?
I'm going to suggest you try asking this on the /r/learnpython sub, as the bot suggested on one of your lasts posts. While that question and this question are a bit more advanced than a new pythonista's typical question, the breadth and depth of experience of frequent commenters on that sub is pretty impressive. Asking the question there could get higher quality help faster. 
the good ones arent free
Are you still looking for a team member?
I posted something on that topic a year ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/5w9yhw/handling\_failure\_with\_either\_exception\_or\_error/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/5w9yhw/handling_failure_with_either_exception_or_error/)
why did you chose python to write this? something this simple could be done in vb
probably knows python and doesn't know vb, in which case he would have to learn a new language (a horrid one at that).
No. 
Fork it
There's a lot of APIs out there: https://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory
Not my intention. I was wondering if it was worth looking into or if the community had some better suggestions.

I actually hit submit before i got to type out what I really wanted to say.. I dont think I totally agree that programming is just taking API and glueing them together. I get the vector of what you are saying - but I dont think thats the true nature or original intent of programming - I think it muddles the water a bit, but of course using a high level language like python I guess it does just come down to being APIs
It calculates Busy Beaver number 10. 
Homework lol :D
Any good ones you've found? I would like to learn. I am fluent in C#, PowerShell, SQL etc - but Python just never clicked for me. I'm looking to get into it for some work tasks. Every post I made in the PS forums was met with enthusiastic support/guidance and the responses here just left me wanting to use PS instead.
I get where you're coming from, but the way I look at it is...even if you're *designing* a CPU architecture, you're just taking the transistors' capabilities (an "API") and gluing it together into a set of instructions, which is in turn an API. Building a compiler in ASM is taking the "API" of available CPU instructions and gluing it together into a higher level language. And so on as you move into higher and higher levels of abstraction. There's absolutely an element of "creation", but you still have to create your new "thing" out of existing parts, tools, and ideas. Conservation of matter and energy applies.
Building a spreadsheet program isn't using an API?
Spotify new api is really cool it returns a lot of scientific data about music
you are right I think because I started with ASM i got all spectrum about it :)
&gt; It helps here to understand how Haskell monadic error handling with Either works, which requires an understanding of monads and other hairy topics. I don't know that it's necessary at all, [Rust's error handling follows that principle and is quite straightforward](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html) however: 1. while it's monadic in nature, Rust can't express monads, so you're never faced with that cognitive overhead 2. it's a dedicated type which spells exactly what it's about ([`Result`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html)), supported by a trait also spelling exactly what it's about ([`Error`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html)), the lexicon is much clearer than Either/Left/Right. 3. Rust is significantly less confused about its error handling as it doesn't have "recoverable exceptions" (any project can set its panic to `abort`, so you can not ever assume a panic is catchable) &gt; But to sum up: no, both Haskell's Either and the library mentioned in the post do not jam all failures into a single type They do though, to an extent. However that single type is a proper enumeration.
Go absolutely definitely 100% does not do that.
I'm confused, what advantages does altair have over mpl in the way of combining graphs, images, tables, and labels. I can appreciate that it's a fantastic viz library, but I see nothing in the documentation that helps with anything outside of charting &amp; labeling.
np it was a good chat, no harm done
&gt; How is jamming all that into a single failure type which has to be handled at a single place advantageous? First, I want to say that I don't intend to slag on Python's exceptions, I don't think the alternatives are super awesome in a dynamically typed language, especially one without pattern matching (Erlang's own solution works well, but the pattern matching is what really makes it). Now then as to the question: 1. the result being reified is convenient to manipulate it this way and that, even if you don't care that a computation is faillible 2. the compiler can tell you exactly in what ways the code you're calling can fail, and you can decide explicitly whether or how to handle each case (or to just push the entire mess up) The latter is the most common issue I have with exception in Python, `except` blocks tend to be either overly broad or too restrictive, it's often hard to know exactly what the callee might throw, especially when it's itself calling stuff not knowing what *they* might throw in turn. The former is why they're more usable than Java's checked exceptions, you'd assume they're pretty much the same but the difficulty of manipulating and abstracting over failure is what makes checked exceptions so frustrating.
pytest-cov will be easier to integrate into CI and tox, and to allow other developers possibly with different tools to use it, and it works within your existing test framework.
If I \*argue\* with you then I must take a contrary position...
There is an open source project that event gets REAL TIME satellite data from NOAA and shows it streaming on a RPi display! &amp;#x200B;
I think if you're proud of putting a time limit on browser navigation, "just adding a neural network" might be a sticking point.
I work a lot with marketing/creative types in an analytic role and I've been looking for a library like this for a long time. I've never really found something like this. There are TONS of charting libraries, but none that can really achieve what you're asking for succinctly. I'm very welcome to being proven wrong! That said, if you invest the time in really learning Matplotlib, you CAN create an infographic ... but it certainly will take a LOT of iterative work. Naturally anything that can output to mpl plot is a valid starting point (seaborn, for example). The "smartest" way of going about this might be for you to learn some basic graphic design skills and build the charts in a data viz tool, then label and imagery gets added afterwards.
The whole purpose of the ai is just to read the same material over and over again.
I've been screen/web scraping my financial information forever. I read your post and wondered if my bank provides an API to download transactions. They do! There's a nice website dedicated to tracking all the different web APIs out there: https://www.programmableweb.com/

To be honest, I could just make it read this infinite number of times. [https://micronations.wiki/wiki/The\_Nation\_of\_Otwells](https://micronations.wiki/wiki/The_Nation_of_Otwells)

Awesome! If you upload a tutorial (because you definitely should) mention me in the post so I know you made one. Anyone in the comments, upvote if you agree that he should make a tutorial.
Using matplotlib, the heatmap is interactive and you can zoom on any section of the chart, which makes it much easier to read. It's 500x500 so all the way zoomed out, you can't read the chart too well, but zoomed all the company tickers are visible and so it the data
One approach - where it makes sense - is to provide to version of errory functions, one which can throw and one which returns a error code. def fcanThrow(x, y): ... def fcantThrow(x, y): try: fcanThrow(x, y) except myFex: return bool #or packed error resjult type This lets the caller decide what's most appropriate. 
Thank you! Makes sense.

This goes against the EAFP principle that Python has. It is more pythonic to try the execution and just catch the error instead of writing a `can_x` method. To me it seems like you want to implement `contracts`: https://github.com/deadpixi/contracts

Graphical programming languages exist. LabVIEW is very popular among scientists and engineers. I am a labview expert and I hate it. It takes a lot longer to work with a mouse vs a keyboard. But maybe it's just me. I have caught a lot of heat on this sub before when I admitted I program GUIs without a graphical designer. Also, graphical programming languages struggle with representing objects, which is fundamental to most programming today. How do you draw something which is entirely user defined?

Mostide's offer autocompletion, which kinda does what you want
I guess I'm aiming more towards autocompletion maybe with very short documentation. I.e you import a package and you'll have a separate menu from which you can insert any of that packages functions with a quick explanation? Very basic stuff maybe? Open. &lt;-- this opens files Save. &lt;-- saves to chosen filepath Click. &lt;-- imitates a mouse click on object I know you can read a packages documentation and learn but I can't think of a disadvantage to this?

Back before Imgur, there was WEFAX! The coolest thing in the world circa 1986 was following plans in magazines to build your own circuit to hook up to your home computer (e.g. Atari ST) and receive satellite weather map images.
There's no room for programming logic in your example - there's a heck of a difference between getting data and doing something with it. In fact, programmers of my generation often make scornful comments about today's generation. I've heard many suggest that they don't really know how to program, just glue open source libraries together. I've heard many bragging that they're the only "real" programmer at their job and all the kids turn to them to get real programming work done. That's why I don't like the idea of suggesting that programming is just gluing APIs together - it sounds too close to that put-down I've heard before. 
I work with the Apis that that likely make the api you mention possible every single day. Lets just say wow, be thankful for abstraction. 
Also, he may have done it as a learning exercise. Not everything is about maximum efficiency or the right language fit.
What kind of board is that?
That's already a thing. Look at some videos of intellisense.
&gt;and gluing it together into a set of instructions Gluing together is just piping data from one thing to another thing. You're leaving out the entirely the concept of logic/programming logic.
This was actually the first time you gave a name to the api you referred to in your first post. 
It was a long time before I realized it, but I also discovered that it really just is all APIs. Once you have a decent mastery, most of the hard work of programming is researching other people's APIs, whether for REST tools or modules or whatever. And your own programming is very much an API. You present a limited set of functions that are available to the user, do all the hard work in the background, and return the desired results. I think in a more formal language like java this is probably more obvious, but it certainly applies to python just as much.
Go get a bot to make 10,000 temp emails and have them repeatedly subscribe and unsubscribe en-mass. Oh dear lord lol
http://www.drawbot.com sounds like what you need.
The deep truth here is that someone who can glue open source libraries together is far more valuable to an employer than someone who insists on re-inventing the wheel, or just does that because they aren't aware of the tools that are already out there. The former is going to be much more efficient for the majority of roles, even if they can't code to bare metal or whatever, because they will be able to put together a proof of concept for an idea in a quarter of the time.

I'm currently using PyInstaller with Python 3.7 and it works.
Using python in microcontroller is just not practical 
The problem with a online ide is I cant access files on my system and install modules and things like that

Probably best to ask on /r/learnpython. What sort of specs are we talking? Midrange, you could get away with something like visual studio code/notepad ++/gedit or a similar gui editor. At the low end you could use something like vim, with or without some plugins to extend functionality

What websites are you scraping? I’ve done something similar in the past with Zillow but curious if there’s better resources
don't know what you're taking about, pimpscro: &gt; ...services built on top of that like **nominatim** have incredibly powerful...
I was doing multiple website because you know, some people post on different websites so I want all options. I've been looking at Zillow, Rent.com, Trulia.com, Realtor.com, and like Apartments.com. Each on is different so I was trying to make a custom scraper for each website. 
When I was working on my project, I used the Zillow API. The API has limits though. Zillow owns most of those websites so it might pull from the same data. It might be worth looking into. 
Alright, I'll definitely check that out. Thanks for pointing this out! 👍

It’s been said, but I’m saying it again. vim :wq 
it stands for "application programming interface" as opposed to CLI or GUI. It it what you use to programmatically interact with a library or service. When using a library, framework, SDK, etc, the functions, methods, classes, constants, etc you read about in the documentation are referred to as the API, specifically the public API Remote services, like websites, often have APIs. It is not a library you download to use. Instead you connect, via http/s or some other protocol, and issue a particularly formatted request to perform actions on the service

I can't think of many examples in the Python standard library where an easy check to avoid exceptions could exist but doesn't though. Trying dict[key] for a non-existent key does throw an exception, but there are also multiple ways to avoid the exception such as using dict.get() or key in dict. The only time I've really run into situations where a piece of code will always throw an exception for normal (rather than exceptional) cases and I have no way of adding guard clauses to avoid them is in third party libraries that aren't designed well. There are of course situations where there is legitimately no way of knowing whether it will work or not such as trying to contact a remote server but I'm not talking about those.
A benefit with Python is that you can solve linear problems much larger than what you could dream of solving with the simplex method. Scipy optimise is nice, but I think CVXPy is easoer, you type in a convex problem using a very nice syntax. It is then translated to an equivalent SDP which is solved using any number of free or proprietary solvers.
Don't listen to anyone saying Vim. Don't get me wrong, Vim is an extremely powerful tool that I use just about every day. However it that takes a long time to get used to. Just see how many results you get by searching "how to quit vim"... I'd go with sublime text, or if that's too much, notepad++ Ps. This question is better asked in /r/learnpython 
Text game is usually easiest. Teaches you output methods, input variance, algorithms, and a few things. Afterward you can apply a gui to it to learn gui stuff...

So, I think the main thing the author forgot to directly state in his or her article is that the library the author introduces is meant to be used in combination with a static type checker, like mypy or pyre. What this means is that the author isn't proposing replacing exceptions with `isinstance` checks and the like -- rather, the author is proposing replacing exceptions with a more monadic style of handling errors, and rely on the type checker to confirm that everything lines up, that you haven't accidentally ignored an exception, and so forth. Although the examples this author gave to try and support this idea are fairly unconvincing, I think this idea isn't too unreasonable from a high-level POV. Picking monadic error handling over exceptions is a legitimate and somewhat common programming language design decision, and so I think it's pretty reasonable to at least *experiment* with retrofitting this sort of error handling paradigm into Python. And if your entire codebase was written in this style, you could in theory confirm that you've genuinely handled every single possible error case in one form or another by simply running your type checker over the code -- no need for runtime tests or manual human inspection. Having the ability to obtain this sort of guarantee can be very attractive if the thing you care first and foremost about is correctness. Basically, you're trying to push as much of the domain-level logic up into the type-checking layer as possible, so you can take advantage of static analysis. But in practice, I don't think the approach the author is proposing will actually catch on in the wider community -- exceptions are a pretty entrenched part of the Python ecosystem, and alternative error handling paradigms are always going to be a retrofit. I can't really see a large number of people embracing this sort of retrofit/trying to push Python in this direction. I also think this technique has some noticeable weaknesses, even _if_ you 100% commit to it on your own projects. In particular: 1. I think monadic error handling in general is useful mostly when you want to bias towards handling errors as early and explicitly as possible. In that case, it's pretty useful to have a type checker that will get in-your-face and force you to be careful about your types. However, for many other kinds of applications it's preferable to just let your errors bubble up most of the time. I think exceptions are more useful here: the programming language handles this automatically for you, and even gives you a nice stack trace at the end. You don't really get this for free with monadic error systems, at least as far as I can tell. You can "bubble up" your errors pretty easily, sure, but if you also want to capture extra context + a stack trace on each level, you're generally forced into using a library: your language won't handle this automatically for you. For example, take Rust. It has an error system that looks clean on the surface, but gets pretty ugly once you start trying to wrap and bubble errors: you're basically forced into using libraries like error-chain or failure if you want this. (To be fair, I'm not really sure if this is a fundamental weakness of monadic error systems, or if it's just a flaw in the programming languages I happen to have experience with -- but it's a complicating factor either way.) 2. I don't think the type checking ecosystem is mature enough to let you actually use any sort of monadic error handling style in a way that gives you a high degree of confidence while still being usable. Basically, you can configure type checkers like mypy to check your code in a lenient way or in a strict way. If you configure them to be lenient, you end up with a type system that has a lot of holes in it (often by design). With that sort of configuration, it's hard to entirely trust the output of the static type checker (and therefore hard to trust the claim that you've handled all errors properly). But if you configure them to be strict, you end up with a type system that's extremely difficult to work with: you end up with a sea of type errors the moment you try using a library that does not use types (i.e. most of the Python ecosystem). tl;dr: I wouldn't say exceptions are an anti-pattern: rather, I think exceptions vs monadic error handling is an interesting programming language design decision. But at present time, in Python, I think continuing to use exceptions is still probably correct due to the trade-offs involved, with or without static typing.

 Hello, Greetings of the day First of all, I would like you to thank you so much for giving us such information about this Technology. A few years back Python was new for everyone but nowadays people are aware of this technology.2 months back I have submitted my project which was related to Python and score very good marks in that. As I have no prior knowledge in Python before joining the [best python training company in Noida](http://pythonandmltrainingcourses.com/). If you fresher then you should join online classes or classroom classes my suggestion is to join classroom classes for better results.

I have completed my Django training from one of the best institutes of NCR. They provide the best[ Django course in Noida](http://pythonandmltrainingcourses.com/courses/best-python-django-training-in-noida/). Understandably, the community for Django is larger and better organized, having been around longer. Flask has the disadvantage here, but it's worth noting that the Flask community is still growing. I don't expect Flask will ever overthrow Django in terms of popularity, but a smaller community isn't inherently bad. 
That ignores the massive processing power available in ARM chips these days. Not having explicit pointers isn’t a problem when you have so much capacity available.

Sublime, VS Code, Gedit, Notpad++ etc. are the second best option. These are relatively small, but they need a bunch of expensive infrastructure to run, s.a. X-server, display manager etc, which will dominate the resource use. Best option: Vim or Emacs, if you are aiming for the minimal CPU/RAM usage. With these you don't need expensive GUI tools. You could run these pretty comfortably even on an old Raspberry Pi. They'd be snappy on a Pentium too. I think DOS had / might still have environments like NC / FAR, which also came with their editors. If you are running something really ancient, you can try some of those. Back in the days when Pentium I was the best personal computer money could buy, I remember there was a Pascal editor I'd run from NC. I think it had autocompletion or some sort of what later came to be known as code intellisense. But I don't remember what was it called.
Hey Victor, I hate to burst your bubble but there are many beginner-discords out there. Have you surveyed the current landscape of such? 
I think it would be fair to say that by now GUI can be considered a failure in terms of human-computer interaction. Since I'm now actively involved in interviewing process (I'm assessing candidates for QA/automation positions), I've discovered this trend: bigger and older companies used to bet on QA/automation tools with graphical interface. They expected those tools to make it easy to employ less skilled employees and make them productive. Apparently, these companies underestimated the effort of making GUI tools. But it's not just that. GUI tools, even after decade or two of use did not create expert users, instead, they put an insurmountable wall between users and their computers. Today, after dedicating half of their career to a particular technology, these people are finding themselves lacking even basic skills that would make them employable. Another similar trend is happening in medicine. The situation isn't that dire there yet, and the whole field is very conservative so, this change will not happen overnight, but the idea where doctors were supposed to become expert computer users by using expensive and opaque GUI programs doesn't hold water. A doctor who knows how to write an SQL query against hospital database is many times more efficient than a doctor who spent ten years working with RIS. Ultimately, GUI is a kind of thing that seems to be good at initial discovery, when it comes to computers, but it's very expensive on one hand, and it reaches the saturation point of its usefulness very quickly, so, doesn't look like a worthwhile investment in the long run.
python cookbook ☝
Just to show how to do it. Using API is not a scraping. Ebay itself is just an example, a dummy. 
ah ok
Thanks for the vote of confidence! We'll see how it goes!
There are two kinds of utilities you can encounter in system administration business: 1. A decently working utility originally written in C reimplemented in Python (for example: `paramico`). 2. A Python binding to a C library (for example: `pyudev`). Try to never use the first, unless for toy projects. Anything written in Python for system administration will work slowly, won't be able to work in parallel, will require a lot resources and will only have like 80% of the functionality you'd expect. Many a time I told myself: how important can it be? I'll just use this little Python utility here, what can possibly go wrong? I'll have easier time debugging or modifying the code later only -- to get burned some time later for the stupid decision that I made.
Wow! That is really cool. I had no idea that existed. I’ll have to deep dive into that and check it out. 
Sounds super annoying 
Open your eyes
Future looks bleak for you then 
Fun project, have you published the source code and list of components? Does it run micropython?
r/learnpython
Just look at what you do and ask yourself: "can I automate it?" That's your project :)
Crap, I actually had no idea that Medium does this! Thanks for alerting me!! I'm now looking into other free hosting platforms for this. Do you have any suggestions for other providers?
Python exceptions are bad, but not for the reason the authors describes. Python exceptions share global state. For example, consider this situation: You have two threads that read from different dictionaries, thread A tried to access an existing key in the dictionary but then relinquished control before checking the error. Then, thread B accessed a non-existing key in the dictionary, and also relinquished control. Thread A picked up, checked the error to figure out if the key is in the dictionary, and even though the key existed, it assumed that the key wasn't there. Also, by checking the last error, it removed the error, so when thread B came to look for the error, it assumed that the key was in the dictionary. What happened in the end: thread A overwrote a value in the dictionary it shouldn't have touched, while thread B crashed with memory access violation. Since there is no way to kill a specific thread, it basically poisoned the memory of the entire program, and it launched a nuclear missile into the allied country or something like that. The sad part is: there is no way you could have protected yourself against this as long as errors aren't bound to the thread that threw them. But threads don't work in Python, so, it shouldn't really concern you. It's more of a theoretic argument. But, suppose, one day Python would have fixed threads, they would also have to fix the exceptions. ---- There are other bad things about exceptions in Python, but I won't go into details.
I have to be the party pooper here and remind you that every single API dependence you add to your app is a new thing that can break in unexpected ways. Yes, enjoy all the stuff out there, there's a lot to choose from, but always plan for it to go down, or get it's format changed, or just plain disappear overnight. Make your code responsive to this and act rationally when (not if) this happens. Even more so if you're in the embedded and/or mobile space, where internet access is not guaranteed or stable.

A tkinter-GUI toolbox for my work colleagues. It will collect a bunch of network controls, uart comms and harware control lines into one place.

Blockchain or bitcoin implementation in python, perhaps?
anything related to security ?

..... I've been working on the same thing basically. Only mine isn't async rip. Mine is very focused on being easy for user though so maybe they can coexist :)
that's an acceptable defense
Python isn't for fast, it's for fast development, which is USUALLY a lot more important.
May I ask you to share the names? 
Look up to the skies
I’d blur out names personally 
Nah, fuck you. Ethics should definetly be considered
I probably agree. Now the resources of programmers as workers are more expensive than computer resources (processor, memory, etc.) But I think my colleagues chosen python based on their largest experience in this programming language \^) If you need "speed" for a high-load project, do you suggest using another programming language?
Really? Keep making pedo malware you peice of shit. All you fuckers making shit for a pedo company FUCK YOU! All thise assholes taking pics of kids through cameras SHOULD BE SHOT!
Perfectly reasonable logic /s
I suggest figuring out what your actual performance needs are first, rather than making assumptions about what you need.
And a fuxk you isn't? Yes I HATE every last peice of shut making that malware and every last cunt company violating my rights. Maybe if you pussies had a spine this wouldn't be issue. But then again it's easier to sit on your ass then stand up and do something.
I said that ethics should be considered after you said "a Job is a Job, even if it means making malware for apple"? I think you're really missing the point in what I said
I felt like abstracting away the different types would be too much. Both my SimpleObject and FullObject types inherit from a common Object type, so one could still do a general type check. When you say saving the items, are you caching them? I considered doing the same for a few different Spotify Objects, but some of them chang and can't really be cached (at least that's what I think I concluded with last time I looked at it). &gt; not that yours is difficult looks a lot better than spotipy Thanks! I also really dislike the spotipy interface...
Yes, but ANY JOB in making AI or doing anything with shit like JS is gonna be maleware. Yes ethics should matter, but if they actually do you'll be jobless.
Sorry but are you legitimately retarded?
No, I have fact and history on my side. A company making closed source shit is making malware.
I've seen that. Way cool :)
Ohh !! I like. I'm looking at the documentation now. I'm going to want to dig into this a lot more!!
"Fast" and "Slow" when it comes to big applications depends more on how good the code is written, and how fast the db/filesystem io is fast rather than the web framework. You can use the fastest C++ framework and have the same performance as the worst Python framework if the code is not optimized and the db is slow. BTW: here's [some data](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/) you can find interesting:
This is still my first stop when looking for something new. Its like "Google" for APIs if you ask me.
This is the very thing that I never knew I wanted so bad. :) Thank you so much for this. You may have just hijacked my day!
I'll admit, I love my command line. I realize that others don't. I was wondering what was needed to take the API thing to "the next level" 
Build a discord bot, the rewrite branch of the discord.py library is insane. It's really rich. And you can do a lot of great and fun stuff with it. And if you want to, you can then extend your bot with a small api in Django or Flask fetching information for you. - exemple : an Api using PRAW(python lib for the public reddit api) and send a daily digest in your discord channel 
I would love to see some of your work. Do you have anything on Github or something? 
I LOVE this !!! bookmarked for sure !!!
Thanks for the reality check! It can't be all puppies can kittens can it ?
Thanks :)
There's an old blog post I wish I could find now, from like ten years ago when people used to argue about the best HTML templating library for Python and one of the factors always cited was speed. Basically the author made a pie chart that showed typical breakdown of what happens during a request/response cycle. Almost all of it was "waiting on DB" or "waiting on network", with a tiny tiny slice for "rendering the template", and a little note saying "obviously THAT is the part we need to speed up!"
Had this idea the other day where you listen to music and the program ranks it among the other music on the playlist and tries to play music it think you're feeling interested in. It probably already does this, but seemed pretty cool. So if you are listening to Slipknot in a playlist filled with death metal and a few songs that are pretty calm, it will rank the song on a scale for emotions and what it portrays, or even on a scale from calm to chaotic. Then it will try to see what you do next when the next song comes on. Skip a more calm song? Let's try more chaotic. So on and so forth. I'm not a programmer, just a silly idea I had
Not him, but it's not very beginner friendly.
I wrote [this](https://pypi.org/project/cfgs/), a tiny, slick utility for managing configuration, data and cache files properly.
Of course not, all these APIs do in fact make our lives easier, but we need to remember that none are perfect and Murphy has a *very firm* hold over IT. Just this morning [this was making the rounds](https://i.redd.it/13jqfnunqbg21.jpg), and people were commenting that it was absurd that a freaking thermostat would fail because an API was unreachable. Just considering the fact that anything can fail and planning for it (offline data? Disabling online-only features but leaving the core fully functional? lots of options) can make the lives of your users better, instead of leaving their families shivering in freaking february because you wanted pretty temperature graphs or something. Do add the fancy bells and whistles (because there's oh so many and they're so freaking awesome), but don't make them indispensable unless there's no choice, unless you wanna be featured on /r/theinternetofshit. And because i wanted to add some more bells and whistles to the pile, [this site](https://www.apiheaven.com/) exchanges API access for Ethereum.

at least you have the time and can afford a CE degree. im over here just trying to get a job in tech by trying to self-study web dev. id love to work with digital electronics and code (learning python right now with LPTHY and also learning some C). im currently building ben eaters SAP-1 8 bit breadboard computer. dont complain. 
I don't havw the money, I am having to work my ass off and prey I can make it happen. Don't sit there and judge my situation as if you even know it.
And all I fucking said was IOT and malware are fucking cancer. Sorry not everyone is ok with being abused
might i ask why python over C? are there libraries for python that are low level like C?
&gt; which will then switch the thread to execute something else as long as the json is being read. Nope. It will schedule `read_json`. If there are no other tasks, it might as well start executing `read_json`. If `read_json` blocks, then it will block. The idea of asynchronous code is that tasks themselves don't block much. But if they do, you, basically, didn't accomplish anything beside making your code less predictable. &gt; My question is - what thread is reading the JSON Same thread, unless `read_json` didn't start another thread. I.e. it will block.
I would like to join, if you ever do create it my discord is Kalto#0418
I just recommend to watch this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-UcUs7IMIM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-UcUs7IMIM)
What happens if you run `cmd.exe` and then type `python`? Does it print anything?
Let's say that there are three methods executed asynchronously: `read_json(), a(), b()` Now, does it mean that once the `await` in `read_json()` is encountered, the next method in the loop (probably a()) will be scheduled and executed until its `await` is encountered, which will then schedule `b()` for execution, until finally it will return to `read_json()`?
Without thinking about it too much, you could try something like beautifulsoup to scrape the page. The resulting page contents are different for valid/invalid pages, so you could look through the html and find an easy way to differentiate them. 
More sharing is more caring 
Any tips on figuring out those projects and sticking to them? What about the stack you use? I mean I've done some projects but I always end up giving up, learning a new language and switching stacks. 
Creating a Telegram bot which can give you following information as reply • weather update of your current city • quote of the day • image with a quote on it And im planning to add more features I just started this project 3 days ago If anybody is intrested to see code let me know If anybody wants to see it working Hit me up on telegram t.me/darkdestination
So much this. You shouldn't be scrutinizing over ms you might save when the db is still taking 10's of ms. [https://i.imgur.com/2UDASMl.png](https://i.imgur.com/2UDASMl.png) this is an app with real world usage. note how small the blue stuff is(ruby) compared to the yellow(db) and that is serving millions of request per day. btw, the spikes are the vacuuming taking place when it's not busy. You are vacuuming aren't you?

Selenium, use an Xpath to look for video unavailable. 
Twilio is usually the go to for this. If it's just for me or internal office stuff I have my apps send me messages on slack or an email. Slack is nice tho because you can send a lot more than a text and still get the instant notification.
I have been trying to read that, for some reason it feels like I am reading a report rather than a book. 
I had a boss who wanted a detailed report of where all of the tickets in our system stood every single Monday. It wasn't just a matter of giving her spreadsheet from our ticketing system or a link to a report. She wanted to see everyone who had touched a ticket, which ones had moved and in which direction, how many comments were made, who made the comments, and probably a dozen of other things I've forgotten. Most of these things couldn't be sorted out through the ticketing systems interface, since it had hard limits on what SQL queries you could run. Putting it together took me HOURS, and she wanted it in her inbox by 10:30am. I asked the sys admin if I could have a copy of the database, and he set up a script to send me one every Sunday night. I then wrote up a report that grabbed all of the information the manager wanted, summed it up in a nice report, and sent it off via email at some random time between 10:00am and 10:15am. Why a random time? Because I wanted her to think it was still a hand-crafted report, especially after she made a lot of noise about her requirements requiring a 'personal touch.' Also, I liked having my Monday mornings back so I could do actual coding.
Silly question but how are you confirming the number of rows? Is it in excel or by opening the final file with pandas and doing a len on the dataframe?
&gt;amounted to £50 But, wouldn't that still be an example of a mass noun? I mean, it is 50 pounds... /s
yeah. Excel even won't load all the file. I use Anaconda suit and Spyder invironment. Once the file is read, I can see in variable explorer what type it is and its actual size. Truth to tell, I opened both files in Notepad++ where I see number of rows.
Have a look at machine learning. If you work on that for a few months, there are big jobs in the field for experts.
Exactly. You wrap existing APIs, whether it's standard library stuff, filesystem functionality, database functionality, etc, into an API. Then that API is called by the command-line or GUI interface you create which defines another API which is then consumed by a human being!
hats off, cool to know :D
why you got dislikes?...
Typed pandas data frames and series to be compatible with mypy and python 3.6. Project came to mind when building a calculator for a hedge fund. The entire project is mypy typed but everything that goes into pandas is just a ball of uncertainty for mypy. I talked to a few other quants at competing funds and it turns out there's a lot of demand for mypy typed data frames. I've build a proof of concept for a subset of the pandas api. The proof of concept is a thin wrapper over pandas with almost no runtime overhead. I've been really busy this week, so any one who thinks this sounds awesome and wants to help then message me and I'll publish the proof of concept on GitHub. 
I'm betting that's not why It's not about pure speed, it's because Python is awesome language
I'm not exactly sure what you mean by "programming logic" in all your responses. Below is some code I wrote to take a newline separated list of ZIP codes and use the USPS API to fetch City/State details for each. I import a number of APIs, define functions that plug the inputs and outputs of different tools together, then consume those functions in main(). Ultimately, my assertion that "it's gluing APIs together all the way down" isn't a derogatory statement. It's a glorious unification of things people seem to think are different but really aren't. At the end of the day, every program is "Call function X. If the result matches this condition, return Y. Else, return Z" layered as deep the the programmer thinks is necessary. And that's fine! It requires a lot of practice and knowledge to understand *how* to break a problem down to the point where a decent program can be made; "gluing APIs together" is hard. But that's all we're doing, just consuming pre-defined means-of-interaction and folding the resulting data into another pre-defined means-of-interaction to be consumed by a different layer of the application. ```python import csv import sys from lxml import etree import requests BASE = "http://production.shippingapis.com/ShippingAPITest.dll/ShippingAPITest.dll" def FindZIP(zipcode): CityStateLookupRequest = etree.Element("CityStateLookupRequest") ZipCode = etree.Element("ZipCode") Zip = etree.Element("Zip5") CityStateLookupRequest.attrib["USERID"] = "XXXXXXXXXX" ZipCode.attrib["ID"] = "0" Zip.text = zipcode ZipCode.append(Zip) CityStateLookupRequest.append(ZipCode) payload = {"API":"CityStateLookup", "XML":etree.tostring(CityStateLookupRequest)} resp = requests.get(BASE, params=payload) doc = etree.fromstring(resp.content) errors = doc.xpath("//Error") if errors: err = errors[0].xpath("//Description")[0].text return None, None, err city = doc.xpath("//City")[0].text.title() state = doc.xpath("//State")[0].text return city, state, None def main(): pma_id = "XXXX" comp_id = "XXXX" zips = open(sys.argv[1]) good = open("good.csv", "w") bad = open("bad.csv", "w") zipwriter = csv.writer(good) errwriter = csv.writer(bad) for z in zips: city,state,err = FindZIP(z.strip()) if err is None: zipwriter.writerow([pma_id, comp_id, z.strip(), city, state]) else: errwriter.writerow([z.strip(), err]) if __name__ == '__main__': main() ```
Was working on an animated film, and fairly late in the process the environment was changed from under us subtly. This was everything from names to positions. This unfortunately undos a lot of work because we do layered overrides per shot etc... And those overrides were now meaningless. This was over hundreds of different shots with tens of millions of assets. So I wrote a script that would walk through both the old version and new version of the environment hierarchy and try and find matches. First by a name based heuristic, and when it couldn't find something almost right, I would construct a KD tree of the children nodes and try and associate closest points. Took what would have been a few months of work to redo everything, to being something that could run in a minute per shot and mostly fix up everything.
I think maybe people thought they were being sarcastic. I interpreted it as being in earnest, though.
a lot of people use python just as a glue between faster C code...but it gives u option not to do that, making ur development faster. People should stop trying to compare languages, and just combine the best parts
Haven't been a problem for me so far, was there something specific you were thinking about?
Probably it sounds sarcastic. But i was complimenting.
It's really hard. I honestly don't have an answer; if you look at my github ( it matches my reddit username ) you'll see dozens of abandoned projects. I have a lot of trouble following through with them. Sometimes I feel like the utility of the project just isn't there anymore ( perminator was written to replace an in-house utility used at a previous job; I don't work there anymore and I don't do mass file-perm modifications anymore so why bother? ) or I just plain get bored or frustrated because I don't know how to solve the challenges. As for my "stack" I spent 15 years with Python, and now I'm mostly into Go because it's an absolutely BITCHIN language. Don't get trapped in brand loyalty. Languages and libraries and technologies are just tools, they are good at doing some number of things. There are other tools better at doing others things. Diversify, don't be afraid to experiment, fail, or start over. Ken Thompson once wrote "One of my most productive days was throwing away 1000 lines of code."
Can elaborate more about this project? I'm fairly interested to know how Python was used in general for this film. Was it for tools for the artists?
This sounds really interesting! Care to share any more about it? 
I haven't written up blog posts for my last couple films (Smallfoot and Spider-Man: Homecoming) but I had some blog posts from my older ones specifically on how python is used http://dgovil.com/blog/2016/11/30/python-for-feature-film/
If all three of them are scheduled, then they will be executed one after another, in some order, so it could be `read_json, a, b` or `a, read_json, b` etc. The only benefit you can possibly get from this is if one of these methods does something in a thread other than the one running the asyncio loop and that asyncio knows about it, in which case it will use a callback to collect the results from the code running in another thread, while allowing other tasks to progress. But if neither `a` nor `b` nor `read_json` don't do anything in threads other than the one running the asyncio loop, you don't get any performance benefits, quite the opposite, the whole infrastructure of the event loop is very expensive, and, on top of that, you lose determinism in your code execution.
Needed that for xfiles
same. a server to dispatch between our legacy api and the new version so that we have a roadmap for moving off ruby. 
keep at it. the learning goes much more smoothly when you have a concrete task you are working on. 
well as a noob to programming (i mean i know HTML and learning CSS but thats not real programming to my knowlage), python has been interesting so far, and its cool to see how C is relative to alot of languages with how syntax is laid out. i was just wondering if python can work with low level hardware like C does (im assuming a library for python)

While working on an Appengine application in 2010ish. Appengine only supported python 2.5 at the time. And it was damn near impossible to install python 2.5 on a mac book pro. Thus, the company was forced to take back the sleek and sexy barely functional mac book pro and give me a big boy laptop(Lenovo W5xx series) that I could install linux on and actually do my job. it was by far my favorite laptop EVER. All thanks to python 2.5
No. Nothing happens
fwiw I wrote a utility called [nip](https://github.com/RopePy/nip) about a year ago to manage my `venv`s. It's similar to npm in that you can `nip init -y` a new workspace (venv), `nip add &lt;package&gt;` and also run scripts `nip run start` defined in the `nip.json` file (these scripts are run in the context of the venv automatically). It's not perfect but it does work and there's also a VSCode [extension](https://github.com/RopePy/vscode-nip-scripts) to run the nip scripts right from the editor making it that much more convenient. Check out the README on Github if you're interested.
bold move and slow news day.
I've seen Guido play with flames in a lake of fire
@therealfakemoot pointed out that yeah, programming is just mashing up APIs. The next step would be to host program it on a platform - consider exploring the a free tiers of the various cloud providers. Also consider hosting your code on a small computer like the RaspberryPi! 
And seeeeee
TLDR; A constructor in any OOP is something that returns a new instance of an object. There is no standalone constructor function in Python, but rather a constructor expression that calls __new__() and then __init__() 
"Sibling" parent classes - lannister style. Also I don't think that a RightPyramid is a Triangle OR a Square. This is a great poster child for when NOT to use multiple inheritance - Composition would definitely be much better. Pyramid HAS a triangle and square, but it isn't either of those things itself, and if you try to do square stuff with a pyramid, you're going to have a bad time.
not exactly as it is a high level language, although there is MicroPython and Circuit Python. Both got similar goals to run on microcontrollers, although CP is creation of Adafruit, and MP is (in my opinion and knowledge) a bit more ambitious project which got bigger traction. I don't know exact details tho, as I'm quite a noob myself/I didn't read deep enough to the topic. So it can (as you can see on picture) but it is a bit striped down and needs biffier microcontrollers. I got micro:bit and besides others it runs MicroPython, although you can't use Bluetooth when you program it with MP because Bluetooth stack written in MP is too big for the device memory
I’m in class right now so I can’t go through it in-depth but I love the idea! Can’t wait to go through it. 
Nice idea! You could also use an USB with a WiFi SD card like Eyefi or ez Share and have the Raspberry Pi connect to it remotely, acting on new files. Keep us informed on the solutions you come up with! 
yeah me too, sentence in itself is usually sarcastic, but in this context it couldn't

I mean if you're not allowed to use USB sticks, how can a Raspberry pi be allowed?
This is a better answer than the sibling which call an API “an end point” or “an http” 🤣
Good question. I think the raspberry pi solves the issue by having it print the file immediately rather than the "issue" of removing it and transporting it
I haven't read Fluent Python, but I know it's a good one. Serious Python is new and interesting. I also like the project based books, like Python Playground or Module Programming with Python. I also have written several intermediate level books: http://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/buy-the-book/

PyPortal includes: Speaker, light sensor, temperature sensor, NeoPixel, microSD card slot, 8MB flash, plug-in ports for i2c, 2 analog/digital pins, 3D files for custom enclosures / lanyard fastening. Open-source hardware, and Open-Source software, CircuitPython and Arduino. The device shows up as a USB drive and the code (Python) can be edited in any IDE, text editor, etc. [https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/14/pyportal-projects-videos-and-more-adafruit-circuitpython-python-pyportal-badgelife/](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/14/pyportal-projects-videos-and-more-adafruit-circuitpython-python-pyportal-badgelife/) &amp;#x200B;
So you need to print the files, how did you do it before? When a USB isn't allowed?
There is no special constructor expression, however much the blog post may claim that. Let's walk through it. &gt;&gt;&gt; class A: ... def __init__(self, a): ... self._a = a ... &gt;&gt;&gt; A(1) &lt;__main__.A instance at 0x10fc9fb90&gt; Seems clear, right? `A(1)` is a "constructor expression". No. It's just a function call expression. The only unusual thing is that the function in question happens to be a class constructor. &gt;&gt;&gt; pfff = A &gt;&gt;&gt; pfff(1) &lt;__main__.A instance at 0x10fc9f998&gt; See? I can just make a variable containing that function and call it. This constructs an object, but you can't claim this is somehow a "constructor expression". &gt;&gt;&gt; map(pfff, range(10)) [&lt;__main__.A instance at 0x10fc9fb90&gt;, &lt;__main__.A instance at 0x10fc9fbd8&gt;, &lt;__main__.A instance at 0x10fc9fc20&gt;, &lt;__main__.A instance at 0x10fc9fc68&gt;, &lt;__main__.A instance at 0x10fc9fcb0&gt;, &lt;__main__.A instance at 0x10fc9fcf8&gt;, &lt;__main__.A instance at 0x10fc9fd40&gt;, &lt;__main__.A instance at 0x10fc9fd88&gt;, &lt;__main__.A instance at 0x10fc9fdd0&gt;, &lt;__main__.A instance at 0x10fc9fe18&gt;] Here we can't even see the "expression".
Lol we did it via the USB and then found out we technically aren't supposed to. So we are continuing to use the USB until we find a better solution which I'm hoping could be this
And what exactly is the reason for you not being supposed to use the usb? Some weird raspberry pi contraption wont give you any data integrity. If the data is so delicate in terms of change, why doesn't the machine digitally sign it?

I don't know much about this, I just wanted to summarize the post, I probably should've said as much. That being said, I'm a little confused now - wouldn't the function call execute the two methods \_\_new\_\_() and \_\_init\_\_() ? And couldn't that function call be considered the constructor expression? This may be worth digging into the source code
Hey, when I first taught myself to code back several years ago, I lost a girlfriend over all of the hours I spent practicing it (she dumped me) Jokes on her, last I heard, her new boyfriend is front desk at a hotel making like $8-10/hr (in his early 30s). I'm dating a PhD student at one of the top ranked schools in the world. Code &gt; girls
You win some you lose some! I'm completely contempt in the outcome. 
Thanks for pointing that out. I will correct that asap.
Don't let haters bring you down. If you want to be alone it's perfect valid. Being alone by choice is not any sadder than dating someone by choise. It is only sad when you want to be with someone and unable to.

Sorry about the cross post :(. So FedEx tracking numbers always start with the number 7 and are 12 digits long. Is there a way to pull that specific string out of random text? It is formatted like this: &amp;#x200B; Joe Smith 790887898447 Janet Smith 790887898444 &amp;#x200B; I want to pull out all fedex number to see if they have all been shipped. I have to do this manually all the time and it is killing me! &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
The main problem is that you either outgrow the buttons pretty quickly, or you become dependent on the buttons and don't really learn the language, which holds you back. Most of the complicated concepts that can't be described in a button depend on learning the simple skills which can, and so you find yourself not able to get past beginner status until you leave the buttons behind. An "import helper" also gets complicated when you consider the problem of installing modules over the network, which gets into virtualenv management, dependency conflicts, and the like. I've heard that some IDEs have figured this out, but it's not as simple as "click to import". As mentioned, an autocompleting text editor or IDE does pretty much what you want while staying out of the way when it's not wanted.
Oh cool! got a git or something? Love to check out your code.
What's about Flask? It is simple to understand and powerful if necessary. 
Writing a simple web scraper to fetch data from [formula1.com](https://formula1.com). Posted some simple stats to r/formula1 and immediately got schooled: the formula1 stats are not the best (some errors in the data). [f1stats.com](https://f1stats.com) seems to be more accurate.
There is almost nothing in the language that cannot be customized and what happens when an object is called is one of the most obvious. It isn't done often but it can be quite useful to override type.__call__ - the function actually responsible for the process you're talking about. Actually, type.__call__ smushes several functions into one where what it does is selected based on the number and types of the arguments. First there is one argument form which actually looks like type.__call__(type, object) and returns the object's type. However, the "self" parameter must be exactly type in this scenario. Then there is the "three argument" form which is used to build new types in the form of __call__(metaclass: type, name: str, bases: tuple, namespace: dict). Otherwise when "self" is not a type subtype of type is when instance construction is done. In that case the signature is __call__(cls, *args, **kwds) and first it attempts to create an instance of cls by calling cls.__new__ using the same arguments it got. Then if the result is a instance of cls is its __init__ method is called like instance.__init__(*args, **kwds). Finally the result is returned. By overriding type.__new__ with a metaclass you can do stuff like prevent __init__ from being called. 
Cool!
I want to make sure my team members timesheet is checked and approved every Monday before 11:00 AM. I have written a script in Python which login into our time tracking system, find missing time sheet for my teammates and send reminder email before Friday EOD. So they can fill timesheet without miss. Next step was to approve or reject timesheet via script which is in progress and requires many checks.
Why not both?

I pretty new to programming but believe you could write a regular expression using the pattern you mentioned to search your file and return the FedEx numbers.
I would go with Flask. Haven't really heard about Nikola... Flask is dead simple
Have you tried _literally anything_?
You don't even need a regular expression. You just need to check that a string _starts with_ something while iterating over the lines in a file. That was a hint for the OP.
Tbh, flask's examples didn't excite me. I'm sure it's a great framework but it's not *sold* in the right way! Have you ever used it? Do you have some flask web examples I could look at? Ps: si ;)

2/2 for Flask... I might have to give it a second look! Thanks!
Why does nobody ever explain the one argument form which is arguably more useful than the zero argument form. In case you don't actually know what use case it has, which wouldn't be surprising since I've never seen an example in any documentation on super, I'll explain it. super is a descriptor, and like all other descriptors when invoked by accessing it as an attribute of an instance its `__get__` method is invoked. If an unbound super instance is attached to the class it can be accessed on the instance with dot lookup and achieve the same simplicity of the zero argument form while being much faster, since the `super` constructor won't have to be loaded from globals and calling a types constructor is... slow, to say the least. class duper: def __set_name__(self, objclass, name): setattr(objclass, name, super(objclass)) That is a silly example of how to automatically assign the unbound super object to a class, directly in the class body whose `__thisclass__` will be the same as it would when the zero arguments form is used. I've been working on a pure python implementation of super and am almost done. If I remember I'll post the source here.
&gt; I just wanted to summarize the post Which you did, so no worries. &gt; couldn't that function call be considered the constructor expression? No. The blog post says it's a "syntactic construct". And that's my point: this doesn't exist in the syntax. Of course, as you say, the function triggers new and init and all that. But in syntactic terms it's just a function call. You can dig through the Python grammar for as long as you like, but you're not going to find any "constructor expression".

Hi Poland, thanks for your comment. I have looked into and even joined some of those groups. My only issue with them was that they were overpopulated and/or there was no conversation really going on.
Perfect, I’ll get one started and throw you an invite!
Can you link to it? I'm trying to fall in love with Flask but really can't seem to find anything that shows the framework off properly.
I'll DM it to you!
Have you tried? [https://discord.gg/8NWhsvT](https://discord.gg/8NWhsvT) &amp;#x200B; The community is very active, friendly and well moderated.

I'm new to python so I'm teaching myself a lot of things. &amp;#x200B; Last week I created a robtex script for pull IPs and DNS information along with country codes for investigation purposes at work. &amp;#x200B; I'm currently working on making multithreaded for shits and giggles but for the life of my I cannot make multi threading or parallel processing to work with it. Granted I don't really know how to make it work in generally, but I'm teaching myself or at least attempting to. 
I’m pretty new to reddit. Does that include the people who subscribe to that community or are you implying that that is where I should have made my post?
I don't use Flask at work but I use it in my "side" projects. I think the best thing about this framework is that you had always the possibility to expand its functionalities. For example... you need REST? No problem, install with pip Flask rest library, import and go on. The same if you need ie websocket (I used this feature to implement an svg frontend for an ai project). Same logics for everything, one "tool" for do anything you need. I think that's a good framework.

Please also check the dedicated packages for dealing with spatial data such as [GeoPandas](http://geopandas.org/index.html) and [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/documentation/). They can manage cartographic projections and will allow for much better accuracy of measurement (especially over large distances). Citing GeoPandas documentation here: &gt; CRS are important because the geometric shapes in a GeoSeries or GeoDataFrame object are simply a collection of coordinates in an arbitrary space. A CRS tells Python how those coordinates related to places on the Earth.
I don't have one. But maybe I will make one soon.
Composition is covered right after that example as a reasonable (and in this case, better) alternative to multiple inheritance. There aren't a lot of simple examples where multiple inheritance make sense (and, I'd argue, probably not a not a lot complicated examples - I've never encountered any need for it, personally), and since a right pyramid has properties of squares and triangles, _and_ you can derive some things (such as a surface area) from those properties, it's enough to show _how_ MI works despite not being a case where you'd naturally go to MI. In actuality, you're right that you should lean to composition for this.
Yes I have. My post isn’t very clear I just noticed. I’d prefer a smaller group. One were we can get to know each other a little better (anywhere from 5-15 people). I don’t even know where to start with a large python community. Thank you for the help though!

&gt; No. It's just a function call expression. The only unusual thing is that the function in question happens to be a class constructor. It's not a function though, or a constructor. It's a class object, which is callable. 
Yes, I know. *Syntactically* it's a function call. But the "function" is a class object.

Can't say I've had this issue and I have data frames with 12m records+ in them. Here is what I'd do....verify your file counts via: 1) In Pandas via df.shape 2) From the command prompt if you have linux or Mac OS, via the terminal run the following command to see how many lines/rows the file has: wc -l CZ_RMS_upload.csv If you are running windows get the git bash shell and the above command should work. 3) Download Sublime. It'll open the csv file quicker than most apps and then you can validate how many rows the file has. Finally I would suggest removing index=False from the to_csv so you can see if there is a point at which it stops writing - which index rows are missing? Also I would not include the column= in the to_csv(), shape/filter your dataframe before you save it. Good luck! 
Try deleting windows 8 worst os ever. 
yeah that is the most frustrating thing is I can't share what I've tried or what I can translate from the perl scripts. :/ I know its a real crap way to present it. I've gotten it to be able to execute the session now I'm trying to just accept a PW auth. Was looking more into just doing like [subprocess.run](https://subprocess.run)() but I can execute the SSH command this way, but it will expect input for the password following it. Thinking about just trying an auth file with the -W arg in the command itself and not even trying to read/input. &amp;#x200B;
this is awesome. thanks.
&gt; I don't do mass file-perm modifications anymore so why bother? Yes, but I don't think you were the only person in the world that regularly encountered this problem - you were probably just the first to try and write a tool for doing this. So there's value to be had in finishing something like that for others to use even if you no longer derive value yourself from it. Of course, then you run into the problem of motivation - why finish it if it's not providing any value to me? To that question, I have no good response.

Wouldn't furlongs per hogshead be inverse area?
You can learn a great deal from books, articles, tutorials, videos etc. Java will help you familiarise with concepts quicker, so it's good that you've done it. I am primarily self taught, so I can relate, but I would say that asking "how long" will sabotage you by filling your head with false expectations rather than help you. The time required will depend heavily on your own efforts, how much time you put, how you advance and adapt your learning but also external factors that are hard to control. Self directed learning while also holding a job is hard. My advice is to work on small goals at a time, and try to find your local coding groups/meetups, if you live in an urban area, such us the [OpenTechSchool](http://www.opentechschool.org/) or groups on meetup.com. This will help you immerse yourself in your new field of learning. You may also find that learning with other people similar to you helps, and you can find free events/workshops to expand your knowledge. Ideally at some point you also want to find people who can mentor you, even if it's not directly (eg by participating in a group project). It may take some time to find mentoring, as all the people who could mentor are usually also busy with jobs and other endeavours, but if you put enough of your own time and effort you will find people who can give you some guidance along the way. Good luck! 
It's distance per volume which I suppose is a form of "inverse area" if you simplify your exponents.
Thanks for the advice! I understand that asking how long may be a difficult question to answer. But what about the probability of landing a job? Employers will probably favor those who have degrees in computer science, but is it still probable for a self-taught individual to start a career? I say probable instead of possible since Im sure there are those who are self-taught yet are still outstanding.

Exactly. I prefer to measure my fuel efficiency in mm^2 though.
For sure. And perminator is like...95 to 99% complete? I haven't done extensive testing because I don't need it, and because going to the effort of generating test data ( a file system with fucked up perms ) and then *independently verifying* ( e.g. via `ls` or `stat` ) is...well, a fucking LOT of effort. If I want to properly exercise all code paths. it's open source, MIT Licensed. Anyone who wants to use it, steal it, finish it, upgrade it, or submit a PR is free to do so. I'm okay with that
Isn’t this possible in Word already?
You certainly can: I taught myself with a book, a Magazine I read first that showed a project and sentdex on YouTube. I learned the basics of the language in about 4 weeks but still am learning new stuff today. I'd say that my code is actually good since about 7 8 to 12 months. Though these times are heavily dependant on what you already know etc.. I've coded alot of industry Automation stuff (PLCs) and various smaller projects in lots of other languages and had a year of formal C# prior beginning and did further C#, C/C++, assembly, SQL... in the year I learned Python so I didn't really have to learn the concepts and already had the mindset needed.
It is very much possible. Degrees are a bonus, but you see them more as a nice to have than a requirement these days. Employers appreciate self learners because it means they don't have to hold your hand and teach you everything and it also shows motivation and sincere interest in the field of work. However it is definitely hard work. Something that counts a lot is doing your own projects or working on open source projects. This is essentially your portfolio as a junior programmer with no experience. You not only need to learn a programming language, but you need to learn at least one specific application of it (Web development, data science, other...), as well as libraries and tools that are commonly used for those tasks. For example most programmers would need to know a version control system, usually git, and have a good working knowledge of command line tools. This is where mentoring can help, having people to stir you through the ecosystems of tools and practices. 
OK I get it… Sounds like you’re working in some closed area. But if that’s the case, have you considered that telling people you’re working in a secure area is itself more information than is perhaps prudent to disclose? I sympathize with your predicament, but try googling and learning Python before bringing questions like this to python subreddit. 
Oh I see what you're saying now, thanks for the clarification, I dare an interviewer to ask me this question now 😎 haha

lol. i'm not about to spend hours programming inside of a vm. 
If you're going to go down the Django path, give Django+Wagtail a shot, they have a blog tutorial too, it's easy enough, but third party wagtail blogs exist too. But then a static site generator would probably be fine too e.g. Hugo, I've used Wagtail for a couple of years now and love it, I took the time to learn it properly.
We have a database that stores all transactions in this system as xml. Every months a ~1000 line SQL script is triggered from "somewhere", generates a mysterious csv and then some process takes that csv and generates a report. Now, one day, for reasons unknown, this SQL was lost (don't ask) and thus the report couldn't get generated and our clients got angry. We cobbled together a Python script that kind of mimicked the SQL by churning through the entire database dump and managed to get the reports out just a week late.
I've got my HHG, which inherits from both "weapon" and "holy relic". You can HHG.attack("Rabbit of Caerbannog") which will behave exactly as you'd expect it to, and you can also HHG.pray(), which behaves exactly the way you'd expect a relic to.
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar
Awesome. 
If you remove Windows and install a stable Linux Distro on that, you're good to go for the next 10 years.
Assignment in Python is better thought of as "name binding". The set literal (`[ ... ]`) yields a Python object, which you assign to the name 'a' in the local scope. `b = a` causes the name `b` to refer to the same object as `a`. `list.reverse()` mutates the referenced object, it does not change the name binding at all. If you want a copy, you must explicitly indicate a copy is desired: `a = b[:]` This is called slicing. Slices are always unique copies of the original list

Either check for the 'Q' before you convert to an integer, or set up a try block to catch the error. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython.

Thank you for your help! 
Feature. It’s a result of how Python handles mutability and variable names. In a nutshell, when you declare and initialize a variable, you bind a name to an object. Then ``b==a`` binds ``b`` to the same object as ``a``. Essentially you can now access the identical list object via two different names. Because Python lists are mutable changing the list doesn’t affect the bindings. That’s the effect you see in your code. Things work differently for immutable objects, for example strings. Until after you do ``b==a`` things work the same. But you cannot change the single string object both names are bound to. For example ``b=b.strip()`` would create a new string object and bind that to the name ``b``.
take it as a string, if it is not equal to q, use exception to convert to int
&gt; It can be seen that the values from a are assigned to b No that is completely wrong. The line `b=a` means 'b' now references the same list that 'a' does. No copy is made. It's related to [this common beginner's trap](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_why_is_my_list_of_lists_behaving_strangely.3F). Try using `b=a.copy()` instead. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
I have also made it. But another thing that bring my python knowledge onto another level was that fact that I tried to build some projects with Python. So I can highly recommend not only to read but also to build something for your own needs. It will help you not only deeper your Python knowledge but also related fields knowledge. 
What about just typing py into cmd. Usually works for me.
Feature, a list is mutable.
Maybe not applicable anymore but checkout the remote capabilities of Pycharm. You can code on your main OS and run your code on a remote host or VM.
