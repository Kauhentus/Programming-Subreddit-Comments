I think that‚Äôs how IMAP works unfortunately.
And that links to: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#formatting-styles Which explains how it doesn't do what you want: &gt; Note that this governs the formatting of logging messages for final output to logs, and is completely orthogonal to how an individual logging message is constructed. &gt; So you cannot directly make logging calls using str.format() or string.Template syntax, because internally the logging package uses %-formatting to merge the format string and the variable arguments. There would no changing this while preserving backward compatibility, since all logging calls which are out there in existing code will be using %-format strings.
Oh no wonder. I was thinking why would it matter if your DB is dynamic or not LOL.
Damn, imagine bruce lee coding

I'm pretty sure wordpress has an API for what you're trying to do
Author here, I admit it was a shameless attempt to gain a few clicks for something that has an admittedly limited use case. I've been working in closed-source Python for 50+ hour weeks for five years, so this was my first exposure to travis and appveyor and Sphinx and codecov and all those not-behind-the-corporate-firewall goodies. I've been using Ansible and Jenkins and am glad to be out of that ecosystem.
I made a simple Kahoot PIN finder that can locate actual active games.
Author here, The stupid thing is, totally agree with you, I first called it tabbedshellmenus, then I was uncertain about "shell" vs "console" vs "terminal", and I got confused by some contradictory information out there (probably my inability to judge what is credible vs. people making shit up), so literally the day I released v.0.1.0 I was so afraid I'd use the wrong term up I went with the first name that occurred to without that term, which was pytabby. I wish I'd thought a little bit harder and come up with "tabby" like the next commenter said, I got a little too excited when I saw the name was available (which should have told me something!) This was my first PyPI submission, I've been working in a crazily paranoid insurance-industry totally closed system for five years with a private server farm and Ansible and Jenkins, and I was a little giddy to be working in open source. Um, I may have borrowed part of the idea from work product I did for my employer, but (a) I coded it from scratch, (b) they didn't have tabs, not sure how usefui those will actually be. Anyways, I'm rambling, just here to say I won't do it again, it's redundant and misleading.
Only if they're all classes.
Automate the boring stuff with Python is a good place to start. Also if you are interested you can join our community [https://pystudygroup.herokuapp.com/](https://pystudygroup.herokuapp.com/)
Overloading `&amp;` and `|` for a rule engine, so that expressions like: (C0 | C1) &amp; C2 &amp; (C3 | C4) | C5 can be evaluated in Python, C-s being instances of class `Clause` with overloaded `__and__` and `__or__` methods. Would have loved to use `and` and `or` for this, but those cannot be overloaded in Python.

I don't know of any huge controversy. Sounds like this guy just doesn't like microsoft, and microsoft was one of the biggest sponsors this year. Thry had one of the largest sponsor booths which attracted a ton of people because their swag was amazing.

Instead of caching, I'm using timestamp based filtering as caching introduces some overhead.
Good stuff! I'd try implementing some sort of error correction for input. eg. kitchn You could compare the input string and the options and decide if the input is close enough to the desired input.
So just out of curiosity, what is ‚Äútedious‚Äù in this process?
Hetzner, you won't find any deal better than this.
Something like this `from difflib import SequenceMatcher` `a = 'apple'` `b = 'appel'` `print(SequenceMatcher(None, a, b).ratio())`

In caching or the process I'm using?
I suspect it's because you can inject a header while the request is then forwarded. In general, while you can perform any HTTP request, the HTTP request still comes from you. However, if you do that injection, the request could be performed not by you, but an internal server, than then would contain your injected header and operate on your behalf.
I'm sure other cloud providers have similar options, but what it sounds like what you really want is a private network like AWS VPC. You can create the database server with only a private network address, which will only be addressable from another machine inside the private network. Then you create the flask app host with a public IP address within that VPC so it can address the DB.
I didn't change it, they're two diffrrent modes so you can choose whatever you like. The difference is that Gouraud is smoother, while on flat mode you can see the polygons (and it looks bad with many meshes)

Wow, that's too difficult for a newbie in this area. I've just started to learn ML and have found a beginner-level article ([https://theappsolutions.com/blog/development/machine-learning-algorithm-types/](https://theappsolutions.com/blog/development/machine-learning-algorithm-types/)).

Probably just some logical fallacy/missunderstanding from your side. If a company is proven to be corrupted that doesn't imply that company's every deed involves corruption - they could have bought something sometime completely legit (seeing that from moral or law perspective). So, my 0.02$, op is about not standing in every mean against financial and marketing benefits that company could bring at the expense of moral implication of being involved into business with corrupted company.
Oh, ok. My plan to do this is the just copy that code outside of a loop and just test it that way.
People use python for this?
Try playing with the user agent of the request. And also I strongly recommend to use requests instead of urlib. btw: this question fits /r/learnpython

Why dont u just put in a recursive function that checks if the input is allowed, and if not just repeats until u put in the right input?
&gt; What advantage does type hinting give over putting the types in the docstring? - The type is right there, next to the parameter, instead of three or five or twenty-five lines away. - there's *one way* to format your type hint, not three or four different conventions for formatting type hints in docstrings. - tiny functions that don't need a docstring can still use type hints. Just off the top of my head, there may be others.
Could implement both to skip slight human error. Kitchn shows a difference of 0.92. Maybe if it‚Äôs greater than 0.9 it should be obvious what the input should be

Please read the frickin' tutorial and stop digging yourself into a hole. I quote: "There is **another**, perhaps simpler way that you can use {}- and $- formatting to construct your individual log messages." \[emphasis added\] You don't like the method using a custom class? Fine -- use the supported Logger technique instead. I showed the custom class version because it was trivially easy and no more difficult than using I will grant you that it's not trivially easy to find an example for this. It took me all of three minutes on google to track down the Logging Cookbook with an example: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#use-of-alternative-formatting-styles which is two minutes too long in my opinion. But in fairness I'm not a logging expert: if I knew the cookbook existed before today, I would have looked there first.
OP's username seems to suggest it is.
I think the input handling needs a bit of looking at to make it more consistant
Just lmao.
You posted to point out that a hypothetical call for a feature that doesn't exist yet doesn't work verbatim because you neglected to define the variable you are trying to log? Whatever would we have done without that valuable insight.
If your friend is not on your LAN, you need to expose the flask server to the internet and use an external IP address to reach it.
Probably going a little off-topic, this is heading towards **framework** and away from **library**, but if you're interested in automating things, the automation part can involve the task(s), their interrelationships, and the scheduling. A job might consist of a chain or graph of tasks. If cron or similar is feeling restrictive (you want to, for example, schedule a three-step process to happen nightly, and you don't want to dig through a log file to see which step failed, or write a bunch of code to make that less of a pain, maybe even get an email when it fails, or retry a few times because websites have unscheduled downtime) then you may want to have a look at something like Airflow ([https://airflow.apache.org](https://airflow.apache.org)) to handle the workflows and scheduling. Python-based, templating, you can make plugins, etc. Has been a pleasure to work with in my last job. For web scraping as an example: [https://towardsdatascience.com/schedule-web-scrapers-with-apache-airflow-3c3a99a39974](https://towardsdatascience.com/schedule-web-scrapers-with-apache-airflow-3c3a99a39974) Since it is Python-based, bring whatever cool libraries you find, write task scripts that take care of each step of your flow, chain them together, and you get a fancy UI to track and manage your executions. If you want a quick overview of configuring it, from single-node to distributed with workers and a queue,, this has proven invaluable for refreshing my memory over the last couple of years: [https://stlong0521.github.io/20161023%20-%20Airflow.html](https://stlong0521.github.io/20161023%20-%20Airflow.html) Is all of this necessary for automating a single person's job? No. But if you have coworkers doing essentially the same work, writing a plugin that handles a common file type and gets it into a database enables your coworkers to automate their jobs as well, and spend more time on the real work. Airflow does have some limitations and annoyances (what software doesn't?) but it also isn't the only option out there for this. Luigi does similar, I haven't used it personally. [https://github.com/spotify/luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi)
That's for sure. I can not win, either because I do not make the right choice, or because the development of the game is not yet complete :)
I have worked on memory forensics code which replicates the MMU for translating virtual addresses to physical addresses and @lru\_cache is magical for optimizing that use case. Can also use it transparently to avoid hitting the disk (even if its an NVMe, hitting the disk still hurts performance) on many places that would end up going and reading a memory image. But yeah, memory forensics isn't probably the use case most people would have/understand out of the box.
It is clear you haven't looked at the docs very long, because you don't understand a key distinction in the logging module. They don't use this terminology, but the final output has too parts: * a header with information gathered at runtime, like the time of the message, the source code file, the line number, etc.. * the actual body which the programmer wrote as his message. `logger.INFO("this is the message body")` Appears as `10am somefile.py line 8: this is the message body` The header is prepared by a formatter that can use any formatting method you want, but formatters are only defined once so its not a big deal. The body can accept arguments, but those arguments must be % formatted. So where it matters (ie the actual `DEBUG`, `ERROR`, `WARNING`, etc..) the format has to be % based. I do know what inn taking about because I actually use logging.
So let me get this. The new trend is to create tutorials for stuff that's like basic documentation stuff to pump up your presence on google?
`What do I do if he runs away?` You should implement some pause functionality. In worst case scenario you'll have to \`sys.exit()\` or even \`ctrl+c\` him :| &amp;#x200B; `Can I feed him mice that I caught in my backyard?` If there's no something like: if type(food) == food_types.mice and food.source == 'backyard': return False in \`feed()\` then you can. &amp;#x200B; `Should I let him free every once in a while?` You should always keep it under control. Uncontrolled can be dangerous for your enviroment. Make sure that he cannot escape his separated environment.
Thank you for you answer, and i'll definitely check /r/learnpython
I made this centipede robot out of 3D printed parts and programmed it using python. I made a hierarchical structure where a Centipede object creates LegPair objects (for each pair), which each create Leg objects, which each create Servo objects. This makes it really easy to coordinate all the legs at once! Please let me know if you have any tips, feedback, or questions!
Thank you for your answer, I'll try to find explanations on how to integrate this to the code
It also gives the manager / head of IT an opportunity to think about what problems might be of a higher priority. &gt;I would love to explore using code to improve efficiency and optimize our processes. Are there any opportunities for this or any issues that I could help with? That might get a quick **no**, but it also might get them thinking about recent pain points. They have the experience of already working in that company, and should already know of some areas of difficulty / frustration. Better approach than just picking what might be considered a low-value 'issue' and spending company time and resources working on it. &gt;You spent how much time working on this? Yes, it is inefficient, but it wasn't worth hours to solve something that costs a small number of minutes in a given month. If you don't get a warm reception to the question, or don't want to open the door to getting shut down too quickly, give it some time working there to see what problems *you* can identify that feel like good candidates for optimizing with code. Then you can prepare a small proposal for your manager / IT that would explain the problem you have identified, and how you think it could be improved or resolved. But it also depends on the company's culture. If your'e in an environment where 'ask forgiveness, not permission' is the norm, then you might have more leeway to just try things out.
'else' is poorly named. Thoughts?
Interesting advice. Git, for example, gives tips: ``` $ git stat git: 'stat' is not a git command. See 'git --help'. Did you mean one of these? status stage stash ```
It turns out this is possible, although it takes a little bit more effort to get it working. &amp;#x200B; See [https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#use-of-alternative-formatting-styles](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#use-of-alternative-formatting-styles), the section about using `LoggerAdapter` &amp;#x200B; It lets you write logging code like this: `logger = StyleAdapter(logging.getLogger(__name__))` `logger.debug('Hello, {}', 'world!')` &amp;#x200B; Which is exactly what I want!

As per the comment on the page: &gt;Just inherit from object on Python 2 and you'll get the same behaviour. Next time read the documentation I bet if you rewrote the 2.7 code to inherit from object and reran the test on 2.7 exclusively, you would have the same issue. Perhaps there should have been some sort of deprecation warning in 2.7 warning this would happen.
So, rather than supply you an answer, here are some ideas for how you can start breaking down this problem: - if this were a math class, what would be the 4 formulas needed to calculate the coordinates from the width and length? Write them down on paper. Those are the four lines of Python code you need. - what Python function is used to display something? - what Python function is used to let users input their own choices? If you know/look up those pieces, you'll have everything you need. Take the time to reading through it--programming will only get more complex from here.
You are actually right, I also didn't realize what is the difference between Capitalize and UPPER (English is my 2nd language), so next thing learned today :)

I recently just accepted a job in Data Analytics (haven't started yet) and basically what I have seen is that corporations have so much data now across so many ecosystems that while managers know how look into one file in one ecosystem, they aren't very good at putting them altogether to get the bigger picture. The qualifications for the position I accepted were SQL and Excel. Bonus points for Python, R, or something similar. I had to take tests in Excel, R, SQL, and then they just sent me an Excel file to analyze real data they collected. I have a math degree, but just worked in general operations for my first job. I incorporated some automation tools with Python and R and just really transformed how my office views data.
hahah wow that's probably not true but thanks!
So far only tested at work while I am doing a completely unrelated job. Just thoug it needs an else statemen for non prime numbers
This is super cool! Awesome DIY work.
great job, congrats
Yes, check if the input is close enough. It is only necessary to remove extra spaces before comparing. Their presence reduces the similarities. Also convert everything to lower case. &amp;#x200B; If the similarity is small, then you can specify a suitable option: Did you mean kitchen \[Y/n\]?

&gt; It is clear you haven't looked at the docs very long, because you don't understand a key distinction in the logging module. You're right -- I misunderstood the docs. Only the log template itself can be directly specified using {} or $ formatting, not the messages themselves. At least, not *directly*. Nevertheless, as I have pointed out, if you want to use {} formatted messages **you absolutely can** by using a wrapper object as shown in the tutorial and a level of indirection. While it might be true that internally logging uses % formatting only, in a practical sense (the only sense that matters!) it isn't true that: &gt; So where it matters (ie the actual DEBUG, ERROR, WARNING, etc..) the format has to be % based. since there is a simple way to get {}-formatting into your logging messages, as in my previous example: logging.fatal(__("not enough {}", "dakka")) The ``__`` message object is a seven line wrapper class^1 which lets you use braces in your log messages. What more do you want? Oh, you want to avoid having to type the `__( )`? Okay, I sympathize with this, and can't help -- but that's not the same as saying that we can't use {} formatting with logging. Yes, I'm a beginner with logging, yes I misunderstood what I read, but you're an expert and you should know that if we want to use {}-formatting in logging we can. Is that the best imaginable interface? No, but I never said it was. ^1 All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection, except the problem of too many levels of indirection.
This automation sounds nice but did not it kill your job?:p
This is one of the reasons that I heavily prefer Reddit. I've found that, for the most part, the sub-Reddits dedicated to certain technologies have a much more welcoming community. That's not to say that there aren't assholes, but here they are the exception, there they are the rule.
Have you considered any alternatives? I used PyCharm previously and really liked it (also, DataGrip) but since then Microsoft has really come a long ways with their free software. Visual Studio Code is pretty useful at this point. And the price (zero) is a plus. [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)
There was a great article somewhere about how damaging the "RTFM" attitude is to the industry. I find that the r/Linux4Noobs is a pretty great sub, though. In more specific subs, it changes. The Arch guys (obligatory "I use Arch" comment here) can be pretty aggressive to noobs in their sub, though.
&gt; since there is a simple way to get {}-formatting into your logging messages, as in my previous example: And as I said, I consider having to define a custom class to wrap together with its parameters to be the very definition of "not supported". You wouldn't claim that "python supports directly running Java bytecode" but I can certainly accomplish such a thing by simply calling `execv` on `/usr/bin/java`. The complexity of having to write this wrapper is not the complaint, that I have to write the wrapper at all is.
I agree but will disclaim that walking the user through locating what they need in the manual is still preferable to just feeding them commands. :)
People help each other for selfish reasons. If you feel someone is being a jerk, it's probably because you're boring him. Find ways to make people help you, don't expect people need to help you. This isn't a religion, experts are here for nourishment, just like beginners.
thanks for sharing this
But "RTFM" isn't the same thing as "walking the user through locating what they need in the manual." I of course agree that teaching new people how to solve their own problems is very valuable. Reminding them that there exists a manual (one they've likely already tried finding the answer in) is more than useless, it's intentionally unhelpful and condescending, and considerably less valuable than not replying at all. And often times, things like the Arch wiki (the greatest of all wikis) is undecipherable to new users. It's thorough to the point of being confusing. I personally really appreciate it when people help me locate the thing I need in the documentation. I swear, with me, half the time it's not even knowing what to Google! I have this special ability to brain fart on super common and super important key words when I'm trying to Google. The people on the other end collecting our data must surely be laughing at me when I want to find "how to create groups in linux command line" and I search "how make people tied together in typey box on puter"
Something like [fuzzywuzzy](https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy) would be easier to use. raw_input = input() choice, score = fuzzywuzzy.extractOne(raw_input, choices) if score &gt; 85: return choice else: print("Invalid input")
Shit. These damn trolls are the cancer of reddit
Sounds similar to my life. I became the local expert in my industry's predominant CRM tool, and I developed expertise in Excel, then SQL, then GIS, then Python. I use *some* R, but I don't feel comfortable calling myself proficient in it.
You should put the messages and choices into a data structure and then be able to repeat all the common processing that would make the code work better. E.g., I started to flesh out the idea here (though only implemented enough choices and messages to demonstrate the concept): https://trinket.io/python3/1e36947932 From this you can easily add things like error correction and deeper paths (without getting into like 10 levels of if deepness) or loops or whatever.
I have found that *most* data analyst positions grow organically out of a specific need within an office/company/industry based on existing workflows and processes. It started with me showing my boss a couple analyses/reports I developed out of our database, then him asking "x and y are cool, can it also do z?" So I'd figure out how to incorporate that. I basically started floating around different teams solving different issues they had with creating workflows around processing all their data. That work dried up and I figured I could make a lot more money doing it elsewhere.
Not sure this is a new problem. As long as I've been aware of stack overflow, I've hated the place because of its elitist atmosphere. Call me crazy, but I just feel that you only get to pat yourself on the back once you've done something to solve the issue.

It really all depends on what you‚Äôre trying to do. But the more you practice, the more it‚Äôll make sense. Good luck!
&gt; Varying variables provide an interface between Vertex and Fragment Shader. Vertex Shaders compute values per vertex and fragment shaders compute values per fragment. If you define a varying variable in a vertex shader, its value will be interpolated (perspective-correct) over the primitive being rendered and you can access the interpolated value in the fragment shader.

Been working on an auto video colorizer app with GUI, having problems with it, so took a break by updating and improving my Webcam Motion Detector code. https://stevepython.wordpress.com/2019/05/16/motion-detector-update
So Gouraud shading gets the normal at the vertex, does the lighting calculation, and then colours are interpolated for the pixels in the primitive (triangle). Phong shading interpolate the normals and then does the lighting calculation at ever pixel. This would take place inside the fragment shader.
That is so impressive! Beep beep, I‚Äôm a centipede indeed.
Consider the largest possible divisor of a number? Try writing out all the divisors for a few different inputs and see what kind of relationship the largest divisor has to its parent number. How can we use that to increase the efficiency of your prime number solver?
Maybe you missed the first line where the dude said he was just beginning? Also, generate primes misses 2, which is prime.

This should be asked on /r/learnpython, as this is for news about python. If you study economics, how long will it take to understand economics? The answer is the same, it depends. It depends on your learning style, abilities, experience, etc. It depends on what you consider to be your goal, and what "understand" means to you. You could take one course in economics, and if you pass, then you "understand economics", though in reality, you've gained the knowledge of a subset of economics. So there is no one answer to this: maybe it takes you 24 hours to learn basic python syntax. Maybe it takes a week. There is no threshold of hours required to understand python, you just need to evaluate how you learn and plan accordingly. Best of luck in your learning
This will 100% haunt my dreams.

2 being prime is debatable so I skipped it

Requiring a username and password is a HUGE barrier to playing your game and it's probably the reason nobody has played it or commented about it here.

I took this class a few years ago when it was based on Python 2, now they've upgraded it: [https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python-2](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python-2) &amp;#x200B; Now, keep in mind I \*started\* using python with version 1 back in 1994 or 1995, so my expectations were more "fill in the holes" than "teach me python". &amp;#x200B; That said, it more than met my expectations. The material covered is good, and it not only teaches you how to use python, but how to think about datastructures and algorythms. You can get course credit and "verified" for extra money, but the class itself is free.
Instead of just having some generic "useful to some people", can you think of anything that you regularly do (don't think of automating, just things you regularly do, like check email or anything) that we could come up with an idea for? Some projects I'm intending to tackle soon are to get a display that pulls down the most recent xkcd, smbc, and Dilbert comics, as I regularly view them. So I want to make a scraper that pulls them down and shows them together for me in one place. I also regularly check security news, and do so at several sites. So I think I'll make a scraper that brings me the article titles (because so many sites have trash articles) so I can click on the ones I want. What sort of things would work for you specifically?
I love it! Thank you so much. I will report back his reaction when the time comes (assuming we're fertile etc. etc. etc.)
Why though? It's an online multiplayer game. You could use any throwaway password and you don't need any email or similar...
Heard at PyCon it is coming "soon"
&gt;def is\_prime(num): &gt; &gt;for i in range(2,int(num\*\*.5)+1): &gt; &gt;if (num % i) == 0: &gt; &gt;return False &gt; &gt;return True
You only need to check each number's divisors up to its square root, like this: def is_prime(num): for i in range(2,int(num**.5)+1): if (num % i) == 0: return False return True
Hahaha, under what definition is 2 being prime debatable?
Very nice! Did you use a library? Or is this all native python?
I often look at my school site what homework I have for the next day, but I have literally no idea how I can get that info from a website. Btw thx for the reply!
Prime means all numbers below the number besides 1 do not divide the number. There are no numbers below 2 that fit this description, making the first sentence true for 2.
This is perfect! Look into "web scraping with Python," there are a gazillion tutorials out there. I had a Stats prof a few semesters ago that had this habit of assigning online homework with no schedule (we could go three weeks without a single assignment, and then the next week have three assignments that week) and with no warning. After the class ended, I told a buddy about it and he made a web-scraper (in Java, not Python) to go to check the site for new assignments, and if it found anything new it would email him. This seems like a perfect task to help you learn to provide real value to you!
Prime means all numbers beside 1 below the number do not divide the number. This definition fails for 2.

People started using Google Spreadsheets here. Unfortunately I haven't heard anything else.
At my company I don't know anyone who has thrown out Excel but Python is used to do some work previously done using macros and other means. I do not believe Excel is going to go away because for the simply stuff it is still very easy to use.
The non-technical people in my company use Google Sheets, which we then download and parse in Python. Scripting in Google Sheets isn't too too bad either. There's a Javascript API for it. I haven't used it professionally, but I did play around a bit with automating things for a Traveller roleplaying campaign.
Thank you, I found that. Here is the link if anyone need; [Soccer prediction model](https://youtu.be/6tQhoUuQrOw)
Interesting. Might actually get me to use wolframlang again. There are quite a few things I miss from the language, but if I could mix it with python that makes some interesting opportunities.
What do you mean? That definition *would* include 2. Every natural number smaller than 2, other than 1, does not divide 2. Given any natural number smaller than 2, if it isn't 1, then it doesn't divide 2. There is no natural number which is smaller than 2, not equal to 1, and divides 2. These are all true statements. More fundamentally, if 2 isn't a prime then you can't break numbers into their prime factors. None of the useful properties of prime numbers hold if 2 is not a prime number.

Hi, I'm the author. Part of the book is done, but it still has to go through the editing process, and that partly depends on No Starch Press's schedule (they always have a ton of books in their pipeline). I have other projects on my plate too: the 2nd edition of Automate, the 2nd edition of my Scratch book, and some video courses as well, as well as a book on recursion. I think (heavy emphasis on "think") it could be out at the end of the this year. I can definitely say that this book isn't a sequel to Automate but sort of a follow up; you don't have to necessarily have read Automate to read this book and it's made for people who have read a beginner resource but want to find out the next things they should learn. There aren't that many intermediate level resources out there, so I wanted to create something for people who are bored of "Hello world" but not yet at the point of advance neural networks or whatever.
No video of it walking?

Answers evolve over time, because frameworks changes or because the question was non-trivial and thus does not have one single good/best answer. I also feel like those 'RTFM' question generate the most traffic for stack overflow. Every time you close a thread that somebody wanted to answer you interrupt that creative/proactive process stack overflow relies on. &amp;#x200B; I always felt that platforms should only be moderated if really neccessary, not because 'I declare this question has been already answered elsewhere'. Give information about the possible duplicate, but let the user decide if the question is worth answering. Hopefully stack overflow survives it's strict approach to moderation as it's a great platform overall.
So steer clear u/stebox. It's clearly not for you. But it's working well for the &gt; 1/4 million times that people have installed it in the past few months. This Reddit post was from a person that DOES want to try it out, that asked for Reddit users' help with an install. The OP deserves helpful answers that try to accomplish what they want to accomplish. I don't see how it could be read as an invitation to personally bash an individual. Follow your own advice and "steer very clear". Don't bother to read the growing number of posts about PySimpleGUI.
You got any programming background?
Looking forward to reading it.
no I was just wondering how you could think like that
You don't have to be a sociapath to have that insight. I even think that there was an economist or psychologist, that received a Nobel prize for quantifying what cause people to behave altruistic. In most cases because they expect to get something back at a later point in time. Given that a lot of the beginner questions asked on stack exchange and here on reddit for that matter never receives an acknowledgment from the askee, I can see where the animosity toward beginners come from.
I know that everyone is online these days, and that the way we communicate has changed. But I think it's really rude that people ask others questions that they clearly haven't even googled. I know that sometimes it might be harder to look if you don't know all the terminology, but if you read up on the basics of your problem or framework, that shouldn't be an issue. You're asking another human being to spend their time helping you, when you haven't even put in the bare minimum of effort. The entitlement really annoys me. I'm not the only one, how many posts on this sub are answered with /r/learnpython? Bare minimum of effort &gt;:( Besides all that, Stack Overflow is useful because it's heavily edited and moderated. There are high quality answers and you don't have to sift through crap to get to them.

Not happening. More and more people use python, but Excel is here to stay. Too many people are allergic to programming.

Copy of the README for those not wanting to open the link: &gt; All unit classes function like floats. You can add, subtract, multiply, etc. any two classes based off the same unit type, ie two units of Acceleration can be added together and the output will be an Acceleration object with the summed value, in units of the first (leftmost) object used, eg: from PyPhySimUnits.speed import MetersPerSecond, MilesPerHour s1 = MetersPerSecond(10) s2 = MilesPerHour(50) s3 = s1 + s2 print(s3) Speed of 32.35204288731173 Meters per Second print(s3.convert(MilesPerHour)) Speed of 72.36932 Miles per Hour &gt; example.py has an example showing this in action. &gt; &gt; Features I Want To Add &gt; In no particular order: &gt; &gt; Automatic unit conversions. Ie, dividing a Distance by a Time results in a Speed &gt; &gt; Use an UnknownQuantity class to track the results of (currently) incompatible units to store a result and the units used to create it &gt; &gt; Support for classes to behave as numpy arrays under the hood in addition to floats, for faster calculations of larger datasets Nothing super fancy about this. I know myself and plenty of other engineers who have bitten themselves by losing track of unit types they're looking at in code. With a little spare time the last few days I took the time to start this repo to make doing physics calc's in Python a little bit easier to ensure you're not adding meters and millimeters, Kelvin and Farenheit, etc etc. Adding new units is very simple, as they all inherit from the base classes and only require 3 lines of code to create. Hopefully some other people find this useful.

Heh don't worry, everyone does it, I've stopped coming to reddit python because there are so many beginners in the Python community these days that every second post is a help a beginner post, it's getting totally out of hand. It means we don't get quality posts anymore which sucks a bit. Because Python is such a popular language there are lots and lots of people learning it. Lots of crappy training courses etc, things like udemy posts flood Facebook python groups and other programming groups, it's so bad I had to leave those groups.
You'll probably want to take a look at PyAutoGUI
However your question does seem well constructed, so I'll help. Nothing worse than really badly constructed questions :) To be honest I've never tried to load fixture data with one field as JSON, but you could always use the Django admin to insert some JSON data in your field and do a dumpdata and see what it generates. By the way what are you using to store your JSON, what version of Django? Are you using a native json field with Postgres, or are you using one of the older django-jsonfield like libraries that really just stores a text field?
Do it, it's a handy language for general problem solving even if you don't end up purely programming as well...
it's an even number so some people say it isn't prime. If it is, it's the only even prime number. If you want 2's just modify the code or something
 I'm also 37, in software development for 2.5 years, professionally 1 year. Having a blast. I say go for it.
pyATS architect here. pyATS isn't exactly Cisco centric. It's built to be cross-network-vendor-and-platform compatible. True it comes out of the box with mostly Cisco support, but that's because Cisco engineering uses pyATS internally, and builds libraries as the features and new releases gets developed. There are examples in the library for supporting 3rd party devices and etc. The whole infra is built to be agnostic. All platform supports are coming from plugins, extentions and library implementations
I'm 38. I'm down with the cool kids, working as a python developer. I don't feel old, lol!! I interview developers, and I don't feel like age is any barrier at all. Personality and zest for the coding discipline and the enthusiasm for technology is really important. I've met coders in their twenties who were completely jaded and apathetic (that probably included me at one point) and coders in their 60's who love what they do, aren't set in their ways at all, and who I'd employ in a heart beat!
Go for it! There's no too old for learning new stuff. There are a lot of resources and online courses.
2/6. You still have to check 2 factors for every 6 candidates. By eliminating divisors of 2 and 3 you prune a lot. This is called wheel factorization. You can make larger wheels but it requires additional complexity
I also have semiprime calculations in my formula and if it said 2 was prime, i would have so many more semiprime numbers
A Wolfram‚Äôs, that how many. =]

Oh right it has 2 conditionals on that one line. Nice. Thanks! I was just learning how to find primes about 2 days ago. Seems like any reduction in calculations you can eek out goes a long way.
This is actually only good if you are trying to check if a few numbers are prime. If you need to find primes from 1-n. Then Sieve of Eratosthenes is the way to go. You don't even need the mod operator for it. You will need memory though.
Could you elaborate on that?
No, the idea is to use the same five words for everything, and only change the last bit. For instance, your password for Reddit might be: "g3enerAlh2ellOk3enobIth2erE rt6" And your password for Facebook would then be: "g3enerAlh2ellOk3enobIth2erE fb8" And your password for YouTube would then be: "g3enerAlh2ellOk3enobIth2erE yE7" (Keywords are "hello there general Kenobi")
Are coding academies worth the time/cost? Or is a four year degree the way to go?
I‚Äôm rather interested in exploring some of the functions as a way to do some feature engineering in a ML pipeline.
I‚Äôve recently started abstracting a lot of the vba/msquery business logic out of excel spreadsheets (querying databases, performing calculations, leveraging lookups, data frame shenanigans) using python; Pandas and sql alchemy are great! The last step is figuring out how to apply all the fun formatting without resorting to vba after writing to the file. The cynical part of me recognizes that management never trusts an ugly report and never questions a pretty one. Sigh. Alternatives? Part of me wants to try shipping reporting as PDFs or html tables/charts/graphics embedded in emails.
This is just my two cents. I have unfortunately been close to technical support with excel. Most people use excel as a ******* database. And on top of it they abuse of heavy features such as conditional formatting (in a way that optimization is just absent). The spreadsheet engine, what excel is, is the part that everyday is being used less and less. So.. If you / anyone wants to make an "excel" replacement, consider that. Focus on the features that unfortunately people are seeking. Also.. Office integration as a whole. Outlook lync share point.. I couldn't even imagine to make OCSI in python. It would require to do everything from scratch. Everything. I really don't see it happening. At least anytime soon. I bite my tongue when 10 years ago when I said (and pretty much everyone on earth) that windows and Linux would never get along. This summer all Windows 10 users will have Linux kernel with a click out of the box. So I won't pretend to make predictions. But still, unlikely. At least for the time being. Again, just my two cents.
Yeah it has to do with the fact that Python is now seen as the number one "first learning language" which means you get lots of absolute beginners that have done absolutely no programming whatsoever asking the same questions over and over again. Most of which can be Googled like "I am trying to make a web page for my data science script I wrote, where do I start!" or "I'm trying to learn Django where do I start!". All of those can be Googled, which just makes the person asking questions look lazy. Your question seemed more directed which I like.
hahah thank you! It warms this frigid calloused heart.
thanks a ton!
Thank you!
So, right now if I run it, it will scramble on the hard surface of my desk, but it struggles on my carpeted floor. I think I need to more carefully choose the cycle the legs do. But let me try and find a video of how it walks so far!
&gt;conditional formatting This is very helpful and one of the bests things with excel. The closest of this that I know is Spyder variable visualization, but it is not configurable. Would be cool to see some kind of Jupyter Spreadsheet. Or Microsoft could implement python alongside VBA as language to manipulate spreadsheets. This was the [most requested improvement feature](https://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304921-excel-for-windows-desktop-application/suggestions/10549005-python-as-an-excel-scripting-language) in 2015 at MS Office products forum.
`any([])` is false. From a mathematical perspective there's *some* value in concluding that 2 isn't prime. I think it's silly to debate it though. It's the trivial case of primality.
The answer is objective and depends heavily on you, how well you digest educational material on your own, whether your learning style matches to the teaching style and whether the course considers any previous programming or not matched with weather you have had ANY programming experience or not.
Just watched a video on it. I see why memory is required :-D
Yeah, supported python within office would definitely be the first necessary step towards the huge changes we want (and the world needs). I wish we could see it happen.
That's gud to hear.
you can expose the port on your firewall yourself but if you're going to be doing this over and over again probably better to go with something like [https://ngrok.com/](https://ngrok.com/)

Don't give password advice when you don't know what you're doing.
Any prime generation code written in python is going to be inefficient. The point was an exercise for a beginner, not to flex algorithm design

Every new skill learned doubles the value of your skill stack. A good read on productivity is 'How to Fail At Almost Everything And Still Win Big'. Introduces the concept of a skill stack and would absolutely recommend diving into Python, among other skills.

Interesting account, from your perspectives would you say age discrimination is becoming less of an issue in software development? You reminded me at how common it used to be to read about rampant age discrimination in that industry and that topic seems silent today.
Interesting for fun but probably not worth it in real use. Your final password is not going to be memorable so you may as well do something with a hash function on a string.
It provides you the environment to run your app (they offer a managed DB as well which you might be using). If you learn how to Dockerize your application, you can likely use Digital Ocean, GCP (my personal fave), AWS, Azure which are considerably cheaper than Heroku for some workloads and scale. These platforms also have managed databases (I know the big 3 cloud providers do, but I'm pretty sure DO rolled something out recently)
If the website stores your password as plain text in its database and that database gets hacked and leaked online, it would be easy for a hacker to guess the password for other services eg Facebook or Reddit. You should always use unique and random passwords for each site.
What do you mean by "host api"? Here's a way to make it so you can drag and drop files onto an executable: #!/usr/bin/env python import argparse import sys def main(): parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() parser.add_argument( "file_in", type=argparse.FileType("r"), default=sys.stdin, help="The input file to read. Dragging and dropping is supported." ) args = parser.parse_args() print(str(args.file_in.read())) input("Done.") if __name__ == "__main__": main() On windows, you'll have to create a shortcut containing the interpreter you want to use, so that shortcut might be something like `C:\Users\Muhznit\venvs\experiments\Scripts\python.exe C:\Users\Muhznit\gitrepos\experiments\drag_and_drop.py.` But after you do that, you can just drag and drop whatever text files on the file system to the shortcut and and the interpreter will print it to the screen.

Yes, I try to at least outline what I‚Äôve tried to rectify the problem. In this particular case I found it via the python documentation for manage.py loaddata script. Probably a place I should have started, now my challenge is properly parsing the json file so loaddata can accept escaped values as seen in the json object above.
I'm 51 and looking for a new job right now, and yeah, it \*seems\* like age discrimination is A Thing, but I believe it that it has as much to do with: 1. Being in the IT world for a long time, whether as a "IT" guy or a developer, makes you a bit cynical. Ok, more than a bit. You don't get excited about stuff like you used to, and you certainly don't avoid sexytime with the MOTAS, beers with the buddies or a night out on the town just to do a deep dive into some random cool piece of kit like you did when you were in your 20s. 2. You expect to get paid more. 3. You don't dress like, or talk like most of the other employees. As it does actual discrimination on the basis of actual age. &amp;#x200B; At 37, and especially just getting into things, those things aren't as bad. &amp;#x200B; However there is a huge gap between knowing a language well enough to get some stuff done, and actually being a python developer.
You're the CTO and you have a talented team of \*young people\*. &amp;#x200B; How many Grayhairs did you interview for your development team?
Depends on what you want to do. &amp;#x200B; If you've got the time, and making an assumption based on your username, there's a bunch of programming bootcamps in Denver. &amp;#x200B; A 4 year degree will give you a LOT deeper knowledge of programming as a discipline.
Very cool sir!
Some, the ones that applied (not many want to work on a startup I guess), but before that I was interviewed... I do not own the company, I'm an employee.
It's actually free if you have a Raspberry Pi.
Hey, I'm giving it a try. &amp;#x200B; I've got some test config that looks like this. **connections:** **- name: my-sql-server-database** **driver: mssql+pyodbc:///?odbc\_connect=** **connection: DRIVER={SQL Server};SERVER=DESKTOP-C5KASSO;Database=Test;Trusted\_Connection=yes** **url\_escape: False** and my code looks like this **from simqle import recordset, load\_connections** &amp;#x200B; **load\_connections()** Getting the stack trace **Traceback (most recent call last):** **File "**[**testql.py**](https://testql.py)**", line 16, in &lt;module&gt;** **params= params** **File "C:\\Users\\amaninglass\\PythonVirtualEnvironments\\foo\\lib\\site-packages\\simqle\\**[**functions.py**](https://functions.py)**", line 41, in recordset** **connection, transaction = \_load\_connection(con\_name)** **File "C:\\Users\\amaninglass\\PythonVirtualEnvironments\\foo\\lib\\site-packages\\simqle\\sql\_tools.py", line 36, in \_load\_connection** **connection = con.connect()** **AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'connect'** &amp;#x200B; Any ideas?
As some initial feedback, I think a more descriptive error (probably a parsing error of some kind with the file) would help me debug better. Fail loudly, fail obviously, etc. I like the idea behind this, I'd be down to help if you have things you need done

Yes it's less mundane now but it can be reduced further
You can try to the software visumap which provides many visualization services for high dimensional data including a fast implementation for t-SNE.
I started with an app called "SoloLearn" for Android. Really great for learning the basics and understanding the syntax. It let's you choose between many programming languages and has little projects, a forum and a friendly community. Cheers!
Impressive
This is awesome! It came out wonderful and I'm sure it was a lot of fun to make together!
There is about a billion lightyears of difference between calling out to an external application to do something, and writing a minimum amount of code to do it -- especially when you don't even have to write it yourself, just copy it from the tutorial. Using your logic, Python doesn't support "divide by 2 and add 1" because you have to write `x/2 + 1` yourself, instead of having a builtin `half_plus_one`. &gt; They either find a way to make this work and add it to the library, or they deprecate the library and tell me to stop using it. Python is open-source. There is no "they" -- *you* "find a way to make this work" and submit a patch or a PR. They aren't the only two options you know. The options include: - use the logging module as-is - follow the recipe in the tutorial to get the functionality you want - write your own replacement - stop logging. There's no reason to deprecate a working library that does precisely what you want just because the solution isn't pure enough for your tastes. The library supports what you want with the addition of one seven line class and four extra characters on each call, but that's not enough for you, and you won't provide a patch yourself. That is a perfect example of the self-centered sense of entitlement of far too many users.
I guess what I'm saying is yes it is worth the effort
Oh I see, I agree with you then. Need to make time for it now
Very cool project. üëçüèº you gave me inspiration
I believe it would be a lot more efficient to connect to each database and check the wp_options table for the version of each one than using selenium, and much much faster. Just an idea. There could be a faster way that I don't know of.

You can use Python to generate and/or read Excel files in gory detail. I use it to suck in excel data and post process it and sometimes create new spreadsheets with it. Great stuff.
any([]) is false, but all([]) is true. If you were using any([]) for this calculation, every nber greater than two would be marked as prime because they all have "any" smaller number that doesn't divide them.
The deprecation had been warned about for ages. This is a difference between new and old style classes. Deprecation warnings between major versions are a tad ridiculous. Developers should be reading the documentation. Shame on this "news" site for reporting this. Shame on this "systems engineer" for making a post on linkedin without reading the docs **and** getting a response from proper channels.
Of course it's the only even prime. Even means divisible by 2. Every prime number is the only one divisible by itself.
Are you sure that isn't Stephen Wolfram's WolframPython that you use with Stephen Wolfram's Wolfram library? Almost as bad as "By installing Oracle Java you will be able to experience the power of Java, brought to you by Oracle."
Node-Red does. Either you just use the exec node or run python within a node.
You could do web-scrapping goals within your first few days if you put some effort into it. I made my first web-scrapping script/program with the language AutoHotKey in about 4 days and only spending about 4-5 hours on those days working on it, it's not exactly pretty, but it does what I need. Currently working on my next one as well, the hardest part is just starting the process and getting past that framework hump, at least for me it is.
Thank you I edited your function a litttle `import string` `alphabet = string.ascii_uppercase` `result = []` `for letter in alphabet:` `result.append(letter)` To get something like this and keep each letter with separate index: `['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z']` I bet there is more proffesional way, but it works, so I'm happy. Also, the shortcut is very useful, I didn't even knew what PEP-8 was, I need to do some reading :)
Holy damn! This is pretty comprehensive. Thanks for the share!
Oh that is great :D Did you make your scraper using AHK, Python or a mix of both? Also, how did you use the information you scraped?
What's the rate of maximum calls made to the Wolframalpha Api?
yes... that's why i said it...
I used AHK to make the whole thing, like I said it's not exactly complex. The information I was scrapping was from an image site, so I used the images for image related uses, that being a lot of various uses. &amp;#x200B; I could have done it in Python as well, but AHK worked out pretty well for me and was fairly intuitive to understand the code, there were also a lot of tutorials from some cool Youtubers on how to do basic things I needed like reading the HTML from a page and filtering out everything else but specific URL addresses so my program could continue doing its task. Look up this guy Joe Glines if you want to learn some basic web-scrapping fundamentals using something like AHK, it's actually pretty simple when you see what is going on.
I see. I actually used AHK years ago to develop simply scripts when playing games, basically to mine and pick up ressources :D
Yeah, that's what most people know it for, but you can use it for a lot of other things, just like any other language pretty much. When it comes to very large projects, i'm not sure how well it would hold up, but for small to fairly large tasks, I think it can work very well.
/r/learnpython read the sidebar ask your professor for guidance python isn't an interface. You run it against code you've written.
How are you creating the position of the paddle? My guess is you already have variables that tell the paddle where to be drawn. You could pull the tracking info you need from that.
Thank you! Was just looking for something like this!
anyway to make this run while the program continues to execute? like an actual loading gif
Ah... I thought it was a programming language though. So I could use python in pretty much any programming software I have? I have octave installed and also arduino, but I also have the basic terminal app that comes on MacBooks. I would need to write my code in one of those programs then import it to python?
Yea I have that but I really don‚Äôt know how to go about this you know? Like I have a start position for paddles and a start position of the balls but idk how to track that
Just so I understand, you're trying to track the users paddle right?
No I‚Äôm trying to track the balls position. Im trying to make it like a one player game so by tracking the ball position I could set the CPU‚Äôs position to the ball
I mean that it is not something which distinguishes 2 from other prime numbers; it is not a reason to exclude 2 as a prime.

I think not. I don't see a field in the database that indicates the WP version? Not sure though.
This is so cool!
Python IS a programming language. It is not a GUI or an IDE. You can write your code in anything you want - vi, emacs, notepad, etc - python doesn‚Äôt care. Most people use an IDE for writing code. Popular choices for python these days are Atom and PYCharm.
I see. So one of the other programs I have that allows me to create code is where I‚Äôll for my creating, then I‚Äôll import it to the python program I have. I‚Äôm not sure I see the benefit of doing that but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm missing something. Thanks for the explanation. I‚Äôm definitely going to ask my advisor about it.

It's an attempt to remain relevant as Python and Jupyter Notebooks wreck this landscape.
This is extremely interesting, but it worries me slightly that they only show jobs that they state Ray excels in compared to multiprocessing.

What kind of techniques you can do in Wolfram that you can't in Python?
52 checking in, learned python in my mid-40s, although I had some experience of C and Fortran in an academic setting prior Never felt any discrimination, I might not think as fast as I used to but I have WAY more experience to draw on than someone younger, and in coding that's far more important. Go for it!
huh thought this would be a python library that helped me scrape wolframalpha.com data so I can check for trends in the response to "What is the average amount of poop a human should generate on a daily basis?"
s == s[::-1]
&gt; the primes except for 2 are not nearly as useful a set Special casing 2 as well as 1 is a pretty easy optimization to make for a prime generator like the one above. So that's a case where primes/2 is a useful a set.
I would like to see a comparison between Ray and a architecture of 1 queue and multiple python instances consuming it. While this approach cannot (easily) handle statefull problems this works quite well for systems like the last example. Just load the model once in all interpreters (constant time) and consume the queue. Quite good horizontal scale while keeping the code/architecture extremely simple and from my experience this is the most used model.
I died to the pythons
All macbooks already come with python - just open terminal and type 'python' without the quotes. Type 'exit()' to leave python.
I mean both languages are Turing complete so you can do anything in either. I happen to have both, so I‚Äôd be interested in trying out some things from wolfram Lang. One thing I think is incredibly powerful is the way you can convert data types in wolfram Lang. I also think that deriving symbolic functions for tone series data and being able to apply it to different data streams and combine them asynchronously could be useful. Obviously these things are possibly in python, but I‚Äôm curious to see how much easier it would be with the api.
Weird. I guess I got bad info from the interwebs. My apologies. Here's another solution that might work https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20118598/how-to-find-wordpress-version-of-a-site-without-logging-into-the-admin-panel If that works, you could use the python package beautifulsoup4 to extract that information from the html without having to login. Either from that or a metatag somewhere else in your html. I saw multiple articles using that method to include an article from 2017. It should still work. If so, it would still be faster than using selenium.

Thanks for the update! Good to read that you have thought about people with intermediate skills in Python. Now that I think about it, all books really are for beginners or experts. As you're doing multiple projects: please take your time :) I'm sure the book will come out great again!
Is it though? It's hardly a real pythonic API. It just takes big chunks of raw wolfram language strings, passes it to a wolfram engine, and returns the result in some strange wolfram format.
Sure. I‚Äôm interested in trying it out. The wolfram engine has some really great stuff and if you want symbolic work, I don‚Äôt think anything truly competes with it. Plus they have a huge amount of ready to go functionality that usually requires quite a bit more work in python.

&gt;The difference here is that Python multiprocessing uses pickle to serialize &gt;large objects when passing them between processes. Why are they being passed between processes?
As someone who writes too many cli apps for they're own sanity I just adore pathlib though it does have it's quirks (like my most recent finding was that `.touch(exists_ok=True)` modifies modification date which is annoying though inteded). Also some packages don't support it thus you need to cast your paths in `str()` awkwardly. Other than that it's really lovely to work with `path / path` syntax is much easier to read than `os.path.join(path1, path2)`
Excellent point. They're not using the multiprocessing module the way it was meant to be used.
&gt; For users of scientific/numerical computing there is statistics module in standard library which provides common functions like mean, median, stdev etc. out of the box. This is much more important for users that are _not_ into scientific/numerical computing as they probably have numpy or some alternative already. My code has become much cleaner with `statistics` module - it's really great for sprinkling some stats into your logs :)
The major barriers to this is security. If I recall properly, this is one of the main reasons why VBA was abandoned.
Paid for by viewers like you.
i been working on a my first python module for other people to create good looking, easy to use cli menus. They are interactive in the way you can arrow up and down to select options and you can put input in and use your prefered colors. currently only supports linux but windows compatibility will be soon. Let me know what you think of it and stuff you would like to see added! will help me in future creations of mine :) [https://pypi.org/project/menupy/](https://pypi.org/project/menupy/)

Hey! Thanks so much for giving it a go! It looks like the stack trace is coming from the recordset function, does your testql.py call recordset() at some point? I'm on my phone so it might not be rendering correctly
That's a great point - showing exactly why it's failing should definitely be a thing for a project claiming to be the simple way to connect to SQL. Thanks for the suggestion!
I've created an issue in the v1.0.0 milestone for this https://github.com/Harlekuin/SimQLe/issues/32
Very cool! I was surprised it ran on my phone...until it didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm going to have to open it up on pc and give it a shot. I like how type out the text as it goes. Also nice author name. :)
Would be nice to compare and contrast to existing packages like astropy‚Äôs unit or unyt or pint
Magic the Gathering is Turing complete but you don't see me deploying it in production.
I was just answering the question. Python can do anything I‚Äôd do in WL, but the things I listed would be easier to do in WL.
If you are good and contribute it doesn't matter how old you are. There are advantages to being young and advantages to being older. That is theoretical of course. Each company is different and age discrimination certainly exists. When you interview, look around and see how many older adults work there. If there aren't any beware. My old company shifted almost over night when they hired a young person as manager who made it his mission to get rid of everyone over 55. I got fired along with a bunch of others. The company paid for doing that to me. I had real good lawyers.
This is very misleading. Pool.map is not an apples to apples comparison to Ray. That‚Äôs not an analogous use of the multiprocessing library at all. I don‚Äôt think this is better than standing up worker processes (using multiprocessing) that consume a message queue (rabbitmq, Redis, Kafka, you choose). Also, stream processing can be very memory intensive. What happens when the system is stressed? How does Ray do then? Is it like Redis and it just falls over and you loose your data? If Ray is for creating distributed systems as described in the post, how does that work when something is stored in memory on one system that another system needs? Or is that an inaccurate description as well?
This is actually good question.
i think they have previous versions of their courses up for free (or they used to), edX and coursera are other options
Thanks ima try it!
Well done!
Hello u/stebox, PySimpleGUI library is gaining lot of success and is growing in popularity day by day. There must be a motivation for this. Some keypoints: * It is really well documented * It is simple to use * u/MikeTheWatchGuy provides a fast help and support Nonetheless, PEP-8 is not a rule, it have to be intended as guidelines. But software development is a creating/inventive process, and rules guidelines can sometime be disregarded in favor of coding pleasure. The 7000 line of a single module is motivated for an easy portability, especially on embedded systems. This is not a problem for end user developers, instead, it is a plus for special cases where you can't use pip. Finally I suggest to give it a try. Regards.
YouTube, A book called: Automate the boring stuff Books and youtube vids are the best cheapest way. Try this google search, "Automate the boring stuff" filetype:pdf You can pretty much download any book with a simple search query like that.
That's great. Some remarks on the project (some of these might already be in your plans, but just in case): - Consider turning the scripts into functions, so that you can say "to import a meah from an OBJ, just run `load_waveform(my_path)`" - Once you have a bunch of functions, you can turn your project into a python module, and the "usage" part of the README becomes: from rendeer import render, load_waveform scene = load_waveform("my_object.obj") render(scene, "my_output.png") Putting your project in library form also makes it easier to test it, document it etc. - Once it is a module you can put it on PyPI so people can install it super easily with `pip install rendeer`. From this point people can get started in seconds! - A very important remark is that you are doing a lot of operations on vectors and lists in general, and all these operations could be done much easier using numpy arrays. For instance your add function ``[x + y for (x, y) in zip(v1, v2)]`` just becomes ``a+b``. This is not just simpler, it is also 10-100 times faster, because the underlying operations are done in C (if I remember well). Other example for the distance: `` (math.sqrt(math.pow((b[0] - a[0]), 2) + math.pow((b[1] - a[1]), 2) + math.pow((b[2] - a[2]), 2))) `` With numpy: ``np.sqrt( np.sum((a - b)**2) )`` - You are using a lot of "for" loops to build lists and strings. Maybe some of these can be replaced by list comprehensions and ``"".join(['a', 'b', 'c'])``. These are faster than "for" loops, and may make some of your code smaller. - For Python standards, use lower_case for variable names instead of camelCase, and try to limit the line length to 80 characters (one of your lines is 340 characters long!), this will make your code more readable.
The first example is not fair right? If you are on a POSIX system (Linux/Mac) and use a global numpy array in a read-only fashion, it will NOT be copied (ref https://stackoverflow.com/a/37746961/335412). Sending it explicitly to each multiprocessor worker is slow and unnecessary. This is the faster than ray code: ```python num_cpus = psutil.cpu_count(logical=False) def f(random_filter): # Do some image processing. return scipy.signal.convolve2d(image, random_filter)[::5, ::5] image = np.zeros((3000, 3000)) filters = [np.random.normal(size=(4, 4)) for _ in range(num_cpus)] pool = Pool(num_cpus) # Time the code below. for _ in range(10): pool.map(f, filters) ``` So what is really the benefit of ray?
YouTube and books. Sentdex and pythonprogrammer on YouTube are great Books: Just google it
Now the question is does it use jit to compile the core or runs it just native python? Then us it worth it to use jit inside of ray, resp. Should you use things like numba.jit or numba.vectorize inside ray?
If a hacker found this password, would they know to change "fb 8" to "rt 6"? I doubt it
If you remember the system then it's pretty easy IMO
?
I see, thanks for the clarification. In that case I would argue that the algorithm you use should be treated as a secret, too. Otherwise getting hands on one single password plus knowledge of the non-private algorithm would be sufficient to deduce all passwords used with this method. &amp;#x200B; Also, your algorithm produces nearly identical passwords and the difference can be guessed by looking at only one single password, thus while providing protection against automated attacks, an attacker who would actually look at you password would get access to every service where you use that algorithm. &amp;#x200B; If you have not heard of it, there are programs and services like KeePass which solve the problem of handling dozens and hundreds of passwords.
Arrogant much? Maybe because the first thing your write (your `is_even` function) is inefficient? You don't need to do: ```` if integer % 2 == 0: return True else: return False ```` If you _really_ wanted this function (which I'd argue you don't), you can simply do: `return integer % 2 == 0` I know this is r/python and not r/learnpython, but you can still be helpful without being arrogant.
Hehe, I'm just poking fun at the Turing complete part
Thanks for the advice, I'll consider all of this
Nice good to know. Cunningham's Law - "the best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer."

&gt; PySimpleGUI library is gaining lot of success and is growing in popularity day by day. And I weep for that, because: 1. it's not really solving the complexity of UI programming. It's just a layer on top of Qt/Tk. 2. There's already a solution for this: pyface. &gt; Nonetheless, PEP-8 is not a rule, it have to be intended as guidelines Programming requires linters. if I have to disable half my linters' features because some programmers felt creative I lose one important degree of consistency. I've seen code where case was completely arbitrary because of this. sometimes callbacks have underscore, sometimes camelcase. It's _bad_ to code in such environment. &gt; But software development is a creating/inventive process, and rules guidelines can sometime be disregarded in favor of coding pleasure. Special cases are not special enough to break the rules. &gt; The 7000 line of a single module is motivated for an easy portability, especially on embedded systems. This is ridiculous. Please go into details. &gt; This is not a problem for end user developers, instead, it is a plus for special cases where you can't use pip. It is. It gives a clear picture of the quality of the tools and the skills of the programmer. The problem is that these tools then end up on my plate as a professional developer trying to fix the garbage that the average pretended developer produces in my company, and I have to deal with them, and cry. &gt; Finally I suggest to give it a try. Regards. Not a fucking chance.
Marketing I guess.
Why did you reimplement pyface?
Amazing, great job
Im now an octopus! Thanks for sharing. This looks like a fun project. :)
We've migrated almost all data processing to python, then create an excel report of the results. The xlsxwriter library is wonderful.
Think Python 2e, the PDF is free online. Also the book is fairly short.

&gt;Ray leverages Apache Arrow for efficient data handling This part got my attention. Vide [Arrow Website](https://arrow.apache.org/) &gt;The Arrow memory format supports zero-copy reads for lightning-fast data access without serialization overhead. I've skimmed through the Arrow docs, but I didn't find any description of this zero-copy reads. How is this supposed to work between two processes in details?
Your post literally says the script logs in to check the version. It said nothing about updating. Lol
So it's basically like a green threads implementation?

Title: "Has the Python GIL been slain?" In accordance with [Betteridge's Law of Headlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge's_Law_of_Headlines) the answer is **NO**. From the article: &gt; Another change for Python 3.8 is that interpreters will all have individual GILs So not only does the GIL still exist, but now there are **more** of them. And this is a good thing.
A workaround instead of a solution. So sad. Just like async stuff.
That is what the task needs. Processes don't share memory, so data needs to move through queues, so it needs to be pickled.
Of course, the solution is so easy. `rm gil.c`. Why was it even here in the first place? smdh
Or S = s.reverse()
Learn Python. Even if you stay in real estate you will DEFINITELY learn ways to increase your efficiency at virtually any task involving computers. Just be careful not to automate yourself out of a job XD
&gt; So not only does the GIL still exist, but now there are more of them. Who knew that would be the way the GIL would be tackled...
Thanks for that, I am using an online interpreter [onlinegdb.com/online\_python\_interpreter](https://onlinegdb.com/online_python_interpreter) which didn't seem to like it if I didn't use the parenthesis, I will try without when I am at home on my main machine. The challenge you mention, do you mean generate a list of numbers and check each to see if it is prime? Or something else?
What if the solution to a bottleneck isn‚Äôt the destruction of that thing, but instead changing it so it‚Äôs not a bottleneck? The GIL is only a problem because it‚Äôs a performance inhibitor. If that‚Äôs mitigated, then I‚Äôm all for it. And your cut on async is pretty unmerited in my opinion. I would have liked to see something like go channels, but async has been really awesome in its own right. Anything that keeps upping performance in Python is welcome üêç!
How would this work with async? Could this allow concurrent execution?
Sorry if it is a bit shaky on mobile. I only tested that it worked on Chrome. Each time you enter a response you have to hit 'return' similar to how you would press the enter key on a keyboard. Thanks for trying it out!
Just reached a point at which I'm ready to share a project I've been working on for a few months. This is my first big project so I'm pretty proud. It's a desktop application for downloading subtitles for your movie files. Check it out: &amp;#x200B; [https://github.com/lukaabra/SubCrawl](https://github.com/lukaabra/SubCrawl)
Such a vicious trap. A truly terrible way to die... :)
I used to use the Wolfram APIs, but just the free quota. I have my Clojure library in github, my account is mark-watson
Ah! So when I ran the update command package that came with the file, that updated the version I already had on my computer? That makes much more sense. Thank you!
Clickbait 120%
Possible solution: allow data to be annotated as immutable (either in code or internally through code analysis), and allow immutable data to be read without locking the interpreter.
I does not. This is with the load_connection call
&gt;This, in turn, means that Python developers can utilize async code, multi-threaded code and never have to worry about acquiring locks on any variables or having processes crash from deadlocks. &gt; &gt;The GIL makes multithreaded programming in Python simple. &amp;#x200B; Wut? Multi-threading in Python is as difficult as in other languages. You **need** to use mutex around you variables. Just try to increment the same variable from two different thread thousand of times and see what happen. The GIL doesn't protect of deadlocks from the Python developer point of view, only C modules can perform such thing "for free".
It looks like if you, for instance, have a node.js producer and a python consumer, python is going to have to duplicate the data to get it into its own format for handling. Arrow creates a standard in-memory format that all languages can utilize so they can process the data without duplicating it.
I'm 38. I would not apply to work for a startup. Too much uncertainty and probably much lower pay. Obviously, the risk and uncertainty are slightly offset by the potential gains but that's not enough for me at this age. The only startup I'd work for these days would be my own but I haven't found(ed) that one yet. :)
Your experience is terrible then. Yes. People who have conventions, code reviews and a strategy to maintain quality HAVE decent codebases or, at least, benefit from more knowledge
What do you mean by "recognizes the packages", exactly? I've never had any trouble with imports on PyCharm.
To me it sounds like a user error that should be easily identifiable by backtracking through the way you say you fix your issues. That being said: Visual Code Studio is great if you want a less complicated IDE with an integrated terminal.
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'name_of_module'
The Linux kernel (not a programming language) went the other way with fine grained locking when they removed the 'big kernel lock'. Though, for an interpreted language, a per interpreter GIL does seem like a pretty reasonable solution. Especially when the alternative is trying to get fine grained locking correct while not degrading performance too badly.
That sounds like an issue with your environment, not PyCharm. Are you using virtual environments for your projects?
Thanks for the suggestion. I'll check it out.
I'm pretty sure it's a problem with the environment but I'm not experienced enough to know what's wrong. As far as I know I've never installed a virtual environment. Just for context I'm using python to assist with my QA / data analysis tasks in the translation industry. I'm not a developer. I've had this problem with a number of basic packages, but for some reason other packages work fine. The problem is that I've consistently been using pip install... The inconsistent appearance if this error is what I don't understand.
It sounds to me like you're using virtual environments and not realising it. Do you run `pip install` from the PyCharm integrated terminal or from your operating system's terminal/command prompt?
It sounds like something hasn‚Äôt been installed in the environment you‚Äôre in or you haven‚Äôt specified to the IDE the environment you‚Äôre in. Personally it seems VS Code needs a little more hand holding when it comes to recognizing imports, for example having to add django-pylint to user settings after installing it.
From Windows command line
From Windows command prompt
Do you have a project where a module you've installed doesn't get recognized?
I'm a bit confused myself, but still, few remarks, perhaps it helps: * are the `'Votes'` and `NaN` in the first row intentionally part of the data, or were they supposed to be column names? (it seems to me they're part of the data) * I couldn't myself replicate getting two different outputs with pandas 0.24.2 and python 3.7.3 * also, somehow weird to have NaNs (not a numbers-s, i.e. special floats ) mixed with strings in one columns. Or are those NaNs also strings? * consider changing column values with `pandas.Series.apply`, for instance `df['Elected?'] = df['Elected?'].apply(lambda x: 'yes' if x == 'ELECTED' else 'no')` * btw, I'd call them pandas (not python) DataFrames
From the article: &gt; ### What about asyncio? &gt; The existing implementation of the asyncio event loop in the standard library creates frames to be evaluated but shares state within the main interpreter (and therefore shares the GIL). &gt; After PEP554 has been merged, and likely in Python 3.9, an alternate event loop implementation could be implemented (although nobody has done so yet) that runs async methods within sub interpreters, and hence, concurrently.
I am just starting my journey with python. I created my first real script that just does simple math and tells a story with it. I am looking for some resources that gives you a good foundation of learning but also to be able to go through a project or two for practice. Right now my first goal is to make a simple program that will take the input of a user for their name, address, and number into a database. I figured that would be a good goal to achieve before even trying a real project.
I think the idea is that you would use the right tool for a given job. Sometimes it is pool.map, others it is Ray, others it is other things.
I have the digital version of this book. I like that I can put it on my second monitor and work on the first. Do you prefer the physical book, and may I ask why? (Genuinely curious because I considered buying hard copies for night time reading).
I think you're right about the virtual environment. I just went and opened the New Project window, and noticed that the pre-selected option was "New environment using: Virtualenv" I deselected that by clicking on the option below called "Existing interpreter", which points to my main Python directory on C drive. Set up a new project, tried the import statement again and it ran with no errors
If you skipped it then why do you include a case in your branching for it to be prime? ‚ÄúIf even and &gt; 2‚Äù shows that you did consider it prime...
If I were you, I'd avoid doing this, and learn about how virtual environments work instead. Having a set of packages for each project is a much better approach than installing everything globally.

&gt;are the 'Votes' and NaN in the first row intentionally part of the data, or were they supposed to be column names? (it seems to me they're part of the data) They are mean to be column names, had not realised they were being displayed as part of the data. I shall look at this in more detail. &gt;also, somehow weird to have NaNs (not a numbers-s, i.e. special floats ) mixed with strings in one columns. Or are those NaNs also strings? This was scraped from a webpage using BeautifulSoup. I believe the entries in the html table were blank. &gt;consider changing column values with pandas.Series.apply, for instance df\['Elected?'\] = df\['Elected?'\].apply(lambda x: 'yes' if x == 'ELECTED' else 'no') Will try this later. Thanks. &gt;btw, I'd call them pandas (not python) DataFrames Thanks, I always muddle my terminology up without meaning to.
Ok, thanks a lot for the advice. I really appreciate it. Will definitely look into it.
I'd recommend going with a virtualenv (if you aren't already) every time you want to start a new project. [https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) pip install that, and then change into the resulting directory. There'll be a file called "activate" that you'll want to source, and after that you should have a clean slate of a python environment. Makes diagnosing versioning/packaging/importing issues very easy.
Open up the built-in terminal in PyCharm. It will automatically place you in the virtual environment. Then run `pip install` from there. If it you don't see `(venv)` to the left of your prompt then run `venv\Scripts\activate.bat` while in the root directory of your project. What this does is make commands like `python` and `pip` point to the version in the `venv` folder. When you install things through `pip install` they will be placed in the `venv` folder instead of a system wide folder.
Heh, thanks for posting the summary. It seems like a terribly kludgey thing to have multiple interpreters. In particular now they're working out some new serialization protocol to share objects between interpreters. Yuck!
Hi, good work! I haven't tried it out but I have some suggestions based of the readme. * Allow the user to supply the whole url instead of just the id. * Allow the user to load ids/urls from a csv-file. * Pick one output format and use it as default, and allow the user to override it.
Nah. Greenlets run in the same thread. These can run in separate threads. Still there's no point, since you can already do this by running another process. The shared memory bit is the key, but that's still not happening either, so ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
That's extremely weak security.
So it's just like the \[Hydra\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernaean\_Hydra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernaean_Hydra)). Chop off one head, and two grow in its place.
**Lernaean Hydra** The Lernaean Hydra or Hydra of Lerna (Greek: ŒõŒµœÅŒΩŒ±·øñŒ± ·ΩùŒ¥œÅŒ±, Lerna√Æa H√Ωdra), more often known simply as the Hydra, is a serpentine water monster in Greek and Roman mythology. Its lair was the lake of Lerna in the Argolid, which was also the site of the myth of the Dana√Ødes. Lerna was reputed to be an entrance to the Underworld, and archaeology has established it as a sacred site older than Mycenaean Argos. In the canonical Hydra myth, the monster is killed by Heracles (Hercules) as the second of his Twelve Labors.According to Hesiod, the Hydra was the offspring of Typhon and Echidna. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
They're saying that your post makes it obvious that you don't know much about password security. I agree with them.
I agree, this doesn't sound like something a better/different IDE would solve. It's possible the PYTHONPATH is jacked up too, if there are issues finding imports. I suggested to OP that they use a virtualenv to start with a clean slate, and go from there. Once within the confines of the virtualenv, make sure the PYTHONPATH is correct, etc
BRO!!!! Your program literally killed my laptop!!!! The amount of error like log first crashed the idle in a matter of minutes and the windows in 20 minutes!! please do something about it... or show me how to remove that log made in the IDLE...
I‚Äôve never made a module accessible via pip install before but I‚Äôd like to learn - could you tell a little about how you learned that? Sorry this doesn‚Äôt address areas for improvement (as you solicited!)
This is getting out of hand...
I am an avid note taker. I like to read through the chapter, underlining anything important first, then I go through the chapter again with my laptop out. As far as preference, I do prefer a physical copy, but I think that has more to do with the fact that I always prefer physical copies of books. Your setup with the two monitors sounds awesome though!
Nice job
1. /r/learnpython 2. `x` and `z` are different objects. `x is z` can't be made true. Are you sure you don't want `x == z`?
Come for the language stay for the community üòé
Hm, I have no idea what could have caused this. Did you just run it or did you import a mesh?
Wonderful, just tried it on a new project and everything worked. I looked in the new project subfolder 'venv/Lib/site-packages' and the pip installed module made it there correctly after using the Terminal in Pycharm to do the pip install. This makes a huge difference and really helps with the learning curve. Thanks a lot.
So we know how the core team answers the question of fighting a 100 duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck.
It could defiantly be better its more a proof of concept at this point but if you edited the frame\_gen file it could look much better.

It also makes sure the video is over 10 minutes as a little touch.
I'll give this a go when I get home from work. I've had a lot of help over the years professionally and I want to start giving back some of the knowledge and help.
ELI5, what is a GIL? I know, should read the article, but hey, that's why you'd go to reddit, right?
Can you do me a favour and elaborate on the details I've missed?
How so?
I copied the exact same block of text, planning to make the same comment. üôÇ [This pycon talk](https://youtu.be/7SSYhuk5hmc) does a good job of explaining why.
JetBrains has a short 8 part series from 2016. Still some good tips! Here's Part 6 (Productive coding): [https://youtu.be/XOkNJxvNtPw](https://youtu.be/XOkNJxvNtPw)
In your program you make ansList, which is a list of divisors. Google "python list comprehension" it's a language feature you could use to make this list of divisors in one line. It's a bit of an advanced feature though, so don't get discouraged if it's a bit difficult.
So that will fix your problem. There's a huuuge but though and I hope you take this to heart as I do this for a living lol. Look into how to use venvs via pycharm AND command line. Pycharm makes it easy - create your project with venv, and then go to the project interpreter (ctrl alt S) and import the packages you need. The reason this is so important is due to package changes and compatibility over time. If you just run everything off a single source, it will cause problems where you can't identify package versions and updates to packages may break your code.
No problem. I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to work. Those usually don‚Äôt in mobile. It‚Äôs close. It works for a while but eventually once the text gets to the bottom of the screen it won‚Äôt scroll. Solid work either way though!
No problem. Unfortunately the packaging landscape in Python is pretty hectic for newcommers. I had to deal with figuring out what in the world was the 'correct' tools and how to use them less than a year ago so I definitely sympathize.
`x = [1, 2, 3]` Makes a new list. `y = x` Passes list x to y **by reference**. **No new list is created!** You can see this by: `id(x)` `id(y)` You should get the same identity for both variables (objects). You can also see this by changing a value in y: `y[0] = 2` Now, `x = [2, 2, 3]` even though you never changed x. You have to be very careful with this! You should use `y = x.copy()` if you want to change the values independently. Finally, `x is y` is the same as `id(x) == id(y)`. It's not comparing the values, it's comparing the objects.

Yeah, we just covered this in the comment thread. I got it working using venv and pip install in the Pycharm terminal. Thanks a lot for your advice, packages/environment have been the biggest headache for me as a newbie so far. This stuff is never covered in the sandboxy tuttorials I've done (datacamp, etc).
It's ~~turtles~~ GILs all the way down...
Awesome! Yeah, I struggled to find good tutorials on pycharm when I started, but I've loved using it over the last few years for how many options it gives you.
There is no universal method to measure string "alikeness". You need to decide how you're going to measure that.
You didn‚Äôt say what the licensing is for this snippet so I‚Äôve actually taken it and created a PyPi module. pip install quicknumberincrementerv2.0.1.2
Lot of stuff here I've been meaning to get more acquainted with, particularly PyArrow. Thanks for the weekend reading!
Based on your use case, sounds like you should look into some sort of NLP semantic comparison. You could come up with a simple heuristic based on character comparison, but if you‚Äôre trying to gauge the accuracy of a translation, it‚Äôs probably a different animal.
Sounds pretty interesting. You need to define a `requirements.txt` and add the dependencies there. Otherwise one won't be able to run without manually going through each `ImportError` and installing that.
I don't see how special casing 2 as an implementation detail changes the usefulness of the output? If it's merely a matter of how easy it is to compute the set, you can absolutely include 2 in the output and still do this same optimization with no loss of efficiency, as even the author of the code suggests. So the optimization has no bearing on whether you include 2 in the output - that's an unrelated choice. And regardless it has nothing to do with why mathematicians singled out and defined this mathematically useful set.
Thanks for the feedback! Currently am setting up pipenv as someone also pointed it out on another thread.
Yeah, I remember I did a lot of hacking with Threads because I did not know about mutexes, SHM, queues and pipes. Moreover my threads started through eval!!! Because for some odd reason it helped to avoid "variable contamination" (as I nicknamed it)... It was my first python app and it was a web crawler. Unfortunately source did not get saved (dead on a drive in another country). Ah good times.
Doesn't seem like. It's Subprocessing but without forking, separate memory, pipes and queues which is costly in Windows.
I was thinking more in terms of quantitative counts (i.e. word matches, word counts, letter counts, number of consecutive characters without divergences between the two strings, etc). This is the first time I've looked at this problem so I would like to explore these "brute force" options first. Accuracy of the translation is not a factor at all. The idea is to be able to flag human translations that are too similar too Google translate. It's something I do everyday by eyeballing (i.e. when I grade tests for new translators), but I'd like to be able feed it entire paragraphs of A v B and automate the alert for a high level of similarity (I would determine the threshold for the alert after looking at different cases) I think I know how to build up these counts by splitting up the strings by words or letters and doing the counts, but I was wondering if there are any obvious modules that already do this kind of comparison. I'm totally new to more advanced methods.
Given that the 'G' stand for 'global' perhaps it needs to be renamed to 'LIL' (local interpreter lock)?
It is my understanding that they are not independent processes. The multiple interpreters will run within the same address space.
Might be okay for datasets, but how would it deal with mutability and removal of objects?
Are you trying to get your GitHub banned in China? Cause that's how you get your GitHub banned in China
&gt; Your experience is terrible then. I've worked for at least ten different companies and in none I've seen decent code quality or these practices implemented. &gt; Yes. People who have conventions, code reviews and a strategy to maintain quality HAVE decent codebases or, at least, benefit from more knowledge It's worse. I've seen companies that do code reviews and a strategy to maintain quality (better: they believe that they have a strategy to maintain quality, normally through massive amount of word documentation) and have dumpster fire codebase.
honestly just figured GitHub was banned in china anyways. maybe ill make it a little more vague... 'social... credit... l y f e s t y l e . . . . . . pls don't take me away
Take a look at the methods in difflib. import difflib # standard library s = difflib.SequenceMatcher(None, "string one", "string two") # Return a measure of the sequences‚Äô similarity as a float in the range [0, 1]. print(s.ratio())
He said without forking.
Thank you for your words :) Nice ideas. I guess I will implement them.
The async cut is very merited. Do you really use async much? Try to create an interface that works in both an async and sync workflows. It's such a huge pita to work with async outside of toy examples or codebases where everything is async. Even something that should be a core part of async, database access is a nightmare currently. The lack of shared memory space in this workaround means it has all of the disadvantages of multiprocessing with very few benefits except no kernel level process overhead which is far from the lion's share.
In what way?
Thank you! Would love to hear your opinion.
Yes sorry forgot to add it https://github.com/Fedzbar/vm-wrapper
Indeed. Macros are the biggest threat. Every security measure taken so far to diminish VBA execution. But.. I am confident of open source power, and being able to warp in a more secure and efficient way threats that way. There is NO 100% way. There never will be. The safest computer is a powered off and offline computer. Honestly even at a purely tehorical level at first glance I am not scared to death of python replacing VBA. It would have to be turned out a lot. Just like VBA is the very small brother of the fully fleshed visual basic. Again, my main point for confidence is the open source aspect. Look at Linux kernel. 100% open source and runs on aaaall kinds of devices. Security holes? Sure. But how many compared to the windows variant, which is different from every architecture? Just not comparable. This is all just purely tehorical talk.
Interesting idea. You could build a social network into your program, which monitored by the goverement of course. Positive side: If you can build a better network with goverment personel, you can improve your social status Negative side: You going to jail. Build a black market, where you can buy reputation. How do you plan to build it? As a console application? Or maybe you want to build a web app, with multiplayer features? :)
I couldn't even call myself a junior dev at my current level of experience. just a very bad programmer lol. So its looking like a console game using OOP

Just to clarify for all, the GIL was fine and the use cases for multithreading were limited to games and single-machine intensive maths. Having a GIL sped up single threads quite a bit.
Everyone seems to be really awesome. I just feel so lost!
A fine GIL to add to my collection
The only "production" use I have heard MicroPython used for, was for conference badges. I would somewhat hesitant to use it unless you are very confident in your tooling and MicroPython itself. Furthermore, you should expect a significant performance hit which may require the use of more expensive microcontrollers than your device may call for. For instance, I've had it use ~128x more code space than a traditional compiled C program The in the end, there are generally two questions you may want to ask is when considering a radically non-standard language 1. "Why do I want to use this language, what features and benefits does it provide?" 2. "If everything goes pear shaped what are the consequences? Does it cost someone a lot of money? Does it cost me my job?" Question two is particularly relevant in situations where updating and fixing stuff can be difficult, situations like embedded devices. All of this said, I've never used MicroPython in prod, only for some dumb prototypes. perhaps there are people here who have used it in prod an can give you more specific input.
So it still needs to copy the data between processes.
Yes, that's absolutely possible. Be more specific about what you're trying to do, and post it in /r/learnpython.

No problem mate. I am happy if I can push you in the right direction. I went through [https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/minimal.html](https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/minimal.html) Just the \`python [setup.py](https://setup.py) register\` part to publish on PyPI is depricated. Nowadays you use \`twine\` for that.
fuck your hacks, don't be a douche
Look into what's known as "levenshtein distance"--it's exactly what you've described. Though, as others have pointed out, it may not be the best way to measure differences between translations, since this doesn't capture semantics at all.
Put some rubber tips on the tips of the feet. A 3D printer would be awesome to help you with that. But this would only help on a hard surface, probably won't do much to help on carpet. Awesome work btw.
Ah I see from your other comments why you need this. Sorry. You can take the levenshtein distance between two strings and make it a percentage by dividing distance by the length of the longest string.
You keep giving me anecdotal experience as to why "everything is trash" so "why bother". Since I have seen both worlds and I know it's not black or white I'm gonna go ahead an just state that you're looking for excuses. You were the one who initiated with the question but don't like ant answer that suggests anything other than your "why bother" conclusion.
I think this post could use a more descriptive title :) Anyway, it would be interesting to compare your code with [RxPY](https://rxpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rationale.html).

Don't get me wrong wolfram engine is pretty amazing, and it is cool that you can sort of interface with it through python now, but it really just that, a very thin interface.

I agree. But I don‚Äôt really see a difference between tensorflow and wolfram in that regard. TF is straight up it‚Äôs own language with a python api.
This is not that much different than using multiprocessing. The GIL can actually easily be removed, the problem is that there are several internals in Python that make it necessary. Believe it or not, GIL actually makes python faster. The problem currently is that removing GIL and replacing it more granular locking makes python work slower and it is not acceptable. Larry Hastings was working on removal of GIL you can find his talks (titled GILectomy), but looks like maybe he gave up. There was also an attempt (I believe from PyPy developers) using checkpointing feature. This would be the way to go, but apparently it is very difficult to get it right. IMO though perhaps what really is needed (and Larry started also thinking in that direction) is to break some Python API and adapt it to multi threading. What probably needs to be done is to have a compile option that causes Python to work without GIL but at the cost of breaking some of API (this would especially broke C API), then developers would have an option to chose: - compatibility with GIL - no GIL, full multithreading, but broken compatibility If user could decide which python version to use and there was a clear benefit, existing applications would be migrated, people would also make sure their code works with both versions.
I hate GILs. They're interpreting and locking. And get global.
Well I thought about that too but I can‚Äôt make it recognize when the flashlight is on and off I might have an idea but for that I gotta learn how to use micro controllers and that‚Äôs another full headache thing to learn xD
Is it fair to assume that the GILectomy is still ongoing, though?
reddit doesn't actually support full markdown. You have to do four spaces instead of the triple-`
&gt;That is what the task needs. Is it? &gt;Processes don't share memory, so data needs to move through queues, &gt;so it needs to be pickled. Python has more than queues. From Mark Summerfield, "Python In Practice": &gt;Alternatively, for multiprocessing, we can use data types that support &gt;concurrent access‚Äîin particular multiprocessing.Value for a single &gt;mutable value or multiprocessing.Array for an array of mutable values &gt;‚Äîproviding that they are created by a multiprocessing.Manager....
It is never too late to learn something new. I was 29 when I started my first job in the IT industry. And this without any academic background or company training, as it is usual or usually required in my country.

there‚Äôs a whole memory and internal data structure layer that is abstracted by python and the GIL. when you append from multiple threads to a single list python won‚Äôt crash ever. now if you don‚Äôt have the GIL two concurrent threads may decide to allocate more memory to grow the native data structure at the same time and now your program either crashes or ends with corrupted data
It's much much more difficult normally. Thanks to python GIL each statement is atomic (when in reality it's more on assembly level). You need to use semaphores/mutexes/etc when you need to synchronize multiple python statements (Python doesn't know what you want until you tell it to). When a function in C extension is called GIL is acquired and nothing changes until that function completes (unless you manually unlock GIL (some extension IIRC numpy does this for longer operations)). Thanks to GIL when writing C extension you completely don't need to think about multithreading unless you chose so (like numpy).
I'm not 100% on this, but I think mp.Value and Array will also pickle and have similar performance to Queues. Very excited about actor implementation. Have toyed with actors and mp in Python. Queues and alternatives peaked at 40-50k messages a second. Never tried full blown ZMQ or Redis, which Ray will use transparently
What about "Guido"?
18 years ago, I was doing python multiprocessing with fork(), and had mmap() shared memory with a C module for atomic swaps, from which any other synchronization system can be built. Even got to publish some of that under GPL eventually, somebody kept it in freeBSD ports for years. It has been a puzzle to me why no one else ever seemed to embrace that. Or at least why it wasn't more talked about. It was quite effective for me; python code to do the gross structure and cut the bottlnecks to C enabled me to discover among other things that the cache lines on 85Mhz SPARC CPUs could be roasted through overuse.
&gt; no GIL, full multithreading, but broken compatibility That's basically what you get with PyPy already, isn't it ? So the option is already there in practice.
How did you do it?
That's fair.

&gt; ELI5, what is a GIL? you're to young to care
It's the controller that makes sure only one Python thread runs per process, making multithreading much simpler but not faster. This is an attempt to make things faster for when you need it. But yeah, googling stuff isn't terribly difficult...
Good idea. I hadn't seen the `units` module in `astropy` before, but it looks nearly identical to what I was hoping this will be in the future. There's some minor differences in usage, and then the main difference seems that `astropy` looks like it's heavily focused on astro-physics specifically whereas I've been not focusing on any one specific subdomain of physics (not necessarily a good thing, just seems to be the major difference). I'll have to take a look at the other two at some point soon as well.
Hey that's probably a really good idea for the hard surfaces. I'm not sure what material to use for the tips though. I'll probably design around the hard surfaces anyway. And thank you!

Working during the day, learning and practicing in the evening. Either tinkering with my own PC or setting up VMs to practice. Mostly until late into the night. I admit, I already had a lot of friends in the IT industry at that time and hung out in all kinds of IRC channels and asked people about problems again and again. And also my partner at that time was very understanding and supported me to the best of her knowledge and conscience. Sure, it's not easy, but it can work. And it's always worth a try.
Cool. Thanks a lot for the tip. Just checked out the basic definition and it's really nice (minimum number of edits, etc). Will give this a try.
I might be wrong, but it seems that global variables are also global per interpreter. You need to write extra code with serialization to share any data between interpreters.
That's a good idea. Forgot you could return a formula that returns true or false. Thanks for the advice! Have a good day.
Hey man, you too, have a great weekend!
Let me know if you end up on any terrorist watchlists. :)
Hahahahah
This would go further than that though, from PyPy FAQ: http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/faq.html#does-pypy-have-a-gil-why
I've been using the multiprocessing module with success for quite a bit now, and I assume this will give multiprocessing childrens access to the main process objects like it happens with threads? That'd be sweet.
I could not give it a try but the quality of your code is really nice. Kudos! Maybe you would want to share how to write maintainable and readable code.

levenshtein distance as noted by /u/super-ouija-mouse. There is a module that uses just that for string comparisons https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy
They could call it POP - Pickle Over Pipes
what is 996???
&gt; You are somewhere between yes and no but I'm not sure you know where Hmm ...
then again you have the 'model citizens' that have a great score, setting the bar for greatness that will never think twice about the negatives of the system. 'more security makes me more safe'.
Might be, still they can create a proper shm for processes. Like how we write "global var" now we can do "shared var" so that var is accessed directly from both. Of course the upstream interpreter should get notifications about changes. I guess instead of current Pipe,Queue system we could get an easy var pub sub. So a Queue could be made by a simple "export jobs" (to create shared memory object) and in sub-interpreter it can be "shared jobs" to access that object. This automatically atomizes actions on the list. Same with dict and other types of variables and objects we can have. So if some sub-interpreter calls pop on exported list or writes into it it has locks around that action implicitly. Sure some actions could be longer but that is why we don't share all variables but just some explicitly. Another thing that should be implemented is notifications (promises?), basically so you can "string.subscribe(self.__add__)" or "list.subscribe(self.append)" so a sub interpreter is locked until the subscribed change happens. Same can be non-blocking so you subscribe but still run other actions and when you receive notification it is handled by a handler. This way a new type of daemon servers could appear, far more efficient which on accept just drop socket they get into the "jobs" list and a subscribed "thread"/sub-interpreter runs its own processing on the job it gets.
I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a few of us here who would help teach you in exchange for real estate insight. Those skills are hard to learn!
You probably want pyautogui https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
Selenium can do this, should be straightforward
 pyautogui can click your mouse for you, and time works for waiting. Basically just make a for loop to set variables named x and y to the coordinates of your mouse (I believe his can be done with x, y = pyautogui.position()) then call pyautogui.click(x,y) and then time.sleep(7)

Why would it need to pickle is access is concurrent? The documentation says.... &gt;Data can be stored in a shared memory map using Value or Array.... &gt;These shared objects will be process and thread-safe. &gt; &gt;For more flexibility in using shared memory one can use the &gt;multiprocessing.sharedctypes module which supports the creation of &gt;arbitrary ctypes objects allocated from shared memory.
Oh that's interesting. Could you please try with sqlite or MySQL in the interim? There are passing integration tests on Travis CI for those databases so it should work if you follow the test code. SQL Server integration tests are on the works

I think it was partly to do with the columns headers being the first row. What I had not noticed, was that the headers should not have an index. I think I was essentially modifying the wrong indexed value, which is perhaps why the second method using iter worked. Once I reset the index, all was fine, both ways (Except I now get a trying to set a value of a copy of a slice, which I will figure out soon). &amp;#x200B; df.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)

I took a brief look at RxPY. I don't think it has anything in common with my dependency graph. let me know, if I missed the connection. My package makes systems with massive calculations that depend on each other very organized and easy to develop. If you read my README, it may become more clear.
Thanks, a lot. Got it working. This is exactly what I was looking for.
If there's multiple of them, then they're not \*global\*, they're just regular locks. You're being confused by the sloppy use of the term "GIL" and not understanding what is actually being said.
Sure, it‚Äôs fine as long as nobody ever wants a web server with concurrency and a shared database connection pool or anything crazy like that.
btw you can install directly from github too. [https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-use-github-as-a-pypi-server-1c3b0d07db2](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-use-github-as-a-pypi-server-1c3b0d07db2)

How concurrent can those calculations be? Is there result caching?
I developed office applications and integration solutions since the 90's, with Excel being the go to solution for analysis work pretty much everywhere. If your spreadsheet apps are simple, then Google Docs is a great solution with lots of easy scripting and integration with other services and information sources. Personally haven't needed MS Office for 5 years because google docs are free and awesome. But for more complex Excel applications Jupyter Notebooks are a great alternative. Code in Python (or any other programming language), inline documentation for the app, run locally or in the cloud. You can start using right now for free with Google Colaboratory. A more extreme use is with Netflix, they use Jupyter as a primary tool in their data analysis platform. [https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/notebook-innovation-591ee3221233](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/notebook-innovation-591ee3221233)
I think Node.js solves this kind of problem by spawning a number of interpreters instances ? Wouldn't Python be able to do that kind of thing ?
There is no concurrency built in for two reasons: 1. The whole thing is a dependency graph, so in general these are not independent calculations. One calculation depends on the result of the previous one. 2. Python, or at least CPython, is not truly multi-threaded. So even if I could take advantage of multithreading, it would have been just theoretical. &amp;#x200B; Result caching could be implemented in specific systems that are built on top of this package, if applicable. Result caching requires assumptions, that I cannot make at the level of this package.

How did it speed up single threads?
This should be a good start: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-scheduledevents-example.html
Yes exactly. It may help you with visibility (`volatile`) and atomic writes to 64-bit values you don't get for free on other platforms, but that's about it. Besides that, it does nothing for atomicity.
I think the (CPython) bytecode instructions themselves _may_ be atomic, but definitely not Python statements. After all, a block statement is a statement too. Even something like `i = i+1` will compile to more than one bytecode instruction.
Thanks!
Honestly, for what you're doing, Django can be kind of overkill. For this kind of simple file uploading and processing, I'd use Flask. It's a lot lighter-weight and easier to learn than Django, and will let you build a simple site that will process your files without a lot of overhead. (You can always move on to Django later if you need something with a lot more *stuff* included--Django comes with its own database interaction layer, authentication system, admin page...you get the idea.)
Mike Moritz can learn to go fuck himself some more.
My point is, if your algorithm became popular and well known, what‚Äôs stopping an attacker from using that information? Let‚Äôs say the database for site.com was released.

You're right, when I said that I was thinking of C api and individual functions. For statement like you said a multiple C operations are being called. Basically every time python enters and executes a C code operation, first thing is to acquire GIL.
I unfortunately do not have any good resources to point you to, however the community over in /r/LearnPython is awesome. Perhaps try posting there as well?

-1 will be like a wildcard in that dimension, taking up as many rows as (number of items in example divided by 28*28). E.g. -1 will become 2 when example was originally (2*28*28) elements

First, there's usually 2 ways to call a numpy function, they're basically exactly the same. 1. array = np.reshape(array, (x, y)) # This reshapes array into a 2D array of shape (x, y) 2. array = array.reshape((x, y)) # Does the same thing as 1. Second, the -1 means to infer the shape from the other values. If I had an array of shape (4, 4) then reshape it into (-1, 2), the function will return an array of shape (8, 2).

That's some ugly boiler-plate they've got going. The 'big doc string' method of defining the code for the sub-interpreter is gross. There has to be a better approach.

The DB object doesn't really matter, it's the engine that matters and I believe there's a connection pool parameter you can set to make it perform better in a high traffic environment.
&gt; /u/CSI_Tech_Dept, 9 years ago How can you not know the expression "ELI5"?
Bloody grammar Nazis.
What's a controller? what's a python? what's a thread,? what's a process and whatever does it mean to "run per process"? what's multithreading? IMO it's impossible to explain something so abstract to a 5 year old. Not picking on you, just a bit annoyed with ELI5 questions on subjects like this, it's more like ELI15 at least.
"Explain Like I'm 5" There's no way in hell to explain something so abstract to 5 year old, ELI15 maybe.
Ok. So I'm totally down to implement `concurrent.pasts` and `concurrent.presents`. Any ideas as to what they should do? (If it wasn't obvious, the article is a hilarious joke.)
You might want to check out autohotkey. Simple to use and powerful tool, although it's not related to python (as far as I know)
VMware workstation is free
I'll check it out, thanks! I don't even mind paying money at this point - what I want is something reliable that will stop wasting my time.
Actually that is let of a problem for 2 reasons. 1. GIL only affect CPU bound tasks, web servers is primarily I/O bound, same with database access 2. unless you're sloppy, implementing http requests is highly parallelizable, you write WSGI app and then you use guinicorn or uWSGI to spin multiple processes. I personally use aiohttp and then gunicorn with asyncio workers with number of threads equal to number of cores.
Ok so that will work out for you. VMware workstation free and your choice of Linux.
VirtualBox or docker container to get a Linux environment will work. Anaconda is a good Windows py distribution, if a bit large.
(I also find it funny that the advice so far for a reliable windows installation is to eat the time and energy of setting up a VM of linux.)
Thanks!
It‚Äôs caused me enough grief over the years that I give python the side-eye when it comes to complex applications.
I haven‚Äôt tested WSL which may be fine.
Have you looked at codeacademy? Lots of free stuff there. They have a python course but the other stuff would be useful for the concepts too.
That's actually the reason why we still have GIL. After multicore machines became popular and people started using them they multithreading. GIL was introduced to quickly fix it. The problem with GIL removal is what to replace it with, anything that's introduced so far is much much slower and that's what's holding it. The actual removal of GIL and replacing with granular locks works and you can use the python, but it makes python slower not only for single thread but even multithreading. You would think that locks would only slow program when multiple threads are trying to access the same resource. Unfortunately, for locks to to be reliable every time a lock is encountered a CPU needs to flush cache. If there are are many granular locks the cache is flushed more often than when there's single lock (GIL).
Actually there are many workarounds for GIL and TBH GIL mostly affects scientific community that uses it for CPU bound tasks, they have multiple extensions to bypass it. It's really annoying because you can't just write program and not think about it if your problem is CPU bound.
I am rather sore at Anaconda currently as I need to run a piece of code for work and the imports have broken on many core scipy functions (no change in environment or code). Good to have a confirmation on using a VM to get Linux, thanks!
What's the error?
Look in to scoped sessions. My advice would be run away from sqlalchemy though, it is massively bloated and confusing.
that's odd. the only time I've seen problems like that in anaconda are when you try to use the python binary without activating the anaconda environment first (if it's in the path, for example, that can happen pretty easily). having to work inside the anaconda environment is kind of a pain but no more so than spinning up a vm.
MIT‚Äôs online sector, MITx, has an awesome class on Edx called 6.00.2X introduction to computational thinking and data science. I was a software developer for 3 years when I found this course, and it treated me very well. I would not recommend it for beginners, but it was a precursor called 6.00.1X and is an intro to python course. The instructor was great and I would recommend learning from this program any day.
I don't think implementing the event loop with subinterpreters would make much sense, but an executor would make sense (currently there's thread and process based executors)
Had the same thought. gmail offers an email API, I don‚Äôt think it needs to be a business account. I‚Äôve never set it up myself but looked at it for something similar for work

Well nothing strange from my usage - its a clean install from a few months back with nothing else touching python - and the import failure is scipy.integrate, which is a rather standard package.
If each has its own, are they still "global" locks?
It already does, with [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) or MPI.

Windows 10 WSL otherwise Python 3.7.3 and Visual Studio Code. WSL will give you Linux if you want that to run Python. Visual Studio Code will give you an idea/debugging. We do 100% development in Windows and deploy to Linux for production
Lil Gil?
I'd heard that the Windows 10 WSL was working well now, thats probably a better option than the other VMs. I'll give Visual Studio Code a look as well, I didn't realize they had a good python extension. Thanks!
In my experience the groupby way is pretty much always faster than doing the same table with crosstab or pivot_table. Have you tested this?

Great post from a great developer. Probably my favorite point: &gt; You can now use the `async` keyword before every single other keyword in the Python language, and we encourage you to `async do so`. There's nothing wrong with cargo-culting some magic keywords all over the place -- you want to go fast, don't you?

This is great! I always tell people that want to learn programming to make an app to solve a problem they have. I read the README, but it wasn't immediately apparent to me: does your tool check for both embedded subtitles and srt files?
I don't think this works for strings. It works for lists though.
I tried to install everything - iPython, scipy, numpy, etc. - under Windows, and it was a nightmare. So I installed CygWin with X on my Windows machine and *built every god damn dependency from scratch*, and that was *easier*. I was able to do this over the course of one afternoon while I was also attending classes, and used the resulting iPython / SciPy install for 3 quarters. Definitely stable.
I don't know who to put this in front of, but maybe one of you will. With machine learning and AI at the forefront of most developers mind's, I would like to see [`do.it`](https://do.it)`()` implemented. Python should be able to figure out what I want.
Thank you very much. Just what I was looking for.
This doesn't directly answer your question, but will hopefully make your life easier in the near future. &gt;Crosby said that among the big new features that are set to land in Docker CE 19.03 is full support for NVIDIA GPUs, marking the first time that Docker has had integrated GPU support in a seamless manner.

I use the windows terminal and pipenv on windows, I‚Äôve used this setup for at least a year and a half with almost no issues. Numpy/scipy have wheels for windows now so installing those from pip shouldn‚Äôt be an issue. There‚Äôs and env variable with pip env, I cant recall off the top of my head, that will install your .venv in your project folder. I would recommend setting that. I use vscode and it will auto detect virtual environments for conda, pipenv and .venv folders in your current directory by default. Vscode opens files really fast, however it‚Äôs more of a text editor with some ide features. There‚Äôs definitely been a lot of work in making windows a first class dev environment in the last few years and I‚Äôm finding my experience in a windows dev env to be pretty good!
I can run pip install numpy scipy with zero issues, is this a recent experience?

Given your background, I'd say sing WSL may be the best choice. Maybe a second option could be MSYS2. But, if you want to give it a try, you can use [the official Python installer for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). You can install as many different versions you need at the same time, and you'll have no problem, since there's no software using a system wide installation of python. For instance I have Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 installed in my system. If I need to develop with one of the interpreters I just create a virtual environment for each specific project. There I can install whichever module (version) I want. I personally just use Powershell for my command line necessities. And Visual Studio Code as an "IDE". I hear PyCharm is a good choice for a full featured IDE. Just FYI, if you do decide to give it a try, give [this documentation a read](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html) since there may be a few caveats and Windows specific configuration. PS: I've never used Anaconda or Spyder.

I'm guessing this is mnist images, which are 28x28 px. The first dimension is the number if example images. The data however is organized as a 2D array, where each row is one entire image, flattened (length would be 28*28=784). The number of rows is the number of images. Since this is often not a fixed value (we don't know how many images will be presented in every batch), setting the value to -1 allows us to slice up the data into nice 28x28 images, for however many images are provided in a given pass.

A waiter has several tables (threads), and several dishes (Python bytecode instructions) to deliver to each table. Since it sometimes takes time for the cooks (non-Python code) to finish a dish (complete an operation), the waiter can multitask: They can pick up one table's list and fill a few items for that table, then put it down and pick up another list to fill part of that table's list. The Global Interpreter Lock says: 1. The waiter can only work on the dishes for a single table at a time. 2. The waiter can't switch tables in the middle of taking care of a dish. 3. There is only one waiter working at a time. The rules matter because, if we know that only one dish is being taken care of at a time, we know there won't be waiters colliding into each other and getting their dishes mixed into each other ([race conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition)). It works fine when there's only one lane in the restaurant (single core). But if you have multiple waiters (threads), they'd step over each other trying to go back and forth through the restaurant. However, when there are many paths (cores) through the restaurant, there is room to move that isn't being used. You could divide the restaurant up into several lanes (multiple subprocesses or subinterpreters) and have the waiters only interact at certain points. That is somewhat wasteful in space (overhead), because you need to construct a door to the kitchen for each waiter (e.g. load up a `list` class object per interpreter). The holy grail is to make good rules for what happens when two waiters (threads) MAY crash into each other (conflict), and how they should act so that it is the same as if only one was working at a time ([serializability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serializability). --- I need to go wash myself now.

Single threads don't have to think about locks, I suppose. In short, the GIL allows Python to optimize for a single thread.
Yeah, it kind of falls flat in my opinion. There's a couple of good jokes there but overall it just sounds like someone with an axe to grind.
The error is that the packages from local requirements don't exist on pypi.
&gt;GIL mostly affects scientific community that uses it for CPU Not really. We link into libraries that release the GIL or just put the slow bits in C or Fortran where you don't have a GIL. Fortran has a bonus of being incredibly easy to write because it's so limited. Fortran was written for engineers, so it's not a huge surprise. I learned Fortran 77 this year in 1.5 days.
My pain is trying to setup a Python 3.7 environment on Windows 10. I tried with both MSYS2 and Anaconda. Neither will work with all of the packages that I need. I can only get Gtk+3 to work using MSYS2, which is the recommended way for that package. Yet, OpenCV only works on Anaconda. Just trying to copy over packages from one to the other hasn't worked. This all has been rather frustrating. More pain is likely ahead trying to get an environment setup on macOS Sierra, as this app must also run on Macs.
\&gt; I should not have sudden unexplained import errors after no modifications to the system! I've never had that issue with Anaconda. Spyder is also open source, but with Python IDEs, it's you get what you pay for. I like WingIDE, but my guess is given the performance, you won't like PyCharm.

They have improved significantly. Wheels exist now and most large packages have been making them for a while.

I've never seen that. Pretty cool! Thank you :)
No, I've mostly used groupby so far. I like pivot\_table, because I think the code is more readable at times. But I also had some memory issue with pivot\_table, so I want to compare the different possibilities, including crosstab. I'm not the author of the article btw.
I would like to reccomend to take a look at "Python module of the week" by Doug Hellman .It has pretty detailed description of standard library modules, as well as decent code examples.
Equally good as the original article.
It's 89 but a 90th can be tolerated if it's a ligature. You'll need to install ligature fonts on your CI if you want it to work there too.
My answer will not provide you with direct answer, but anyway :) I was able to do this, but only on Linux host, since it is much simpler. There are two caveats in this approach (running GPU powered app in docker container on Ubuntu): 1. Proper configuration of docker daemon on host 2. Proper list of Nvidia devices capabilities. Feel free to ask me additional questions in case you are interested.
Yes I feel uncomfortable though I'm fine. I believe a lot of people will feel uncomfortable with that picture.
Yeah, packaging... I think, I've fixed it: https://github.com/dephell/dephell I really feel this pain in words "python packaging". Otherwise, would I do 1k commits in 1 year of full-time work to fix it?

What are you talking about? Flask-SQLAlchemy implements scoped sessions, so that‚Äôs already taken care of. As for your other commentary it‚Äôs certainly a complex and powerful library, but it‚Äôs hardly confusing. The basics are pretty easy, and additional complexity is there if you need it.
I like the books by https://nostarch.com/catalog/python Really informative. Costly but free downloads can be found elsewhere

Same thing here. Pivot table was actually very slow for me at times. Ans the crosstab notation bugs me because you have to include the df name for each variable.
well a while loop can't catch exceptions, right?

Cool
from retrying import retry, there you go
Hmm it appears as "v" on my screen
That's strange. Maybe try importing a mesh with fewer polygons (less than 2k for example)
To my mind TDD and database schema design are not natural bedfellows. There is no clear benefit in checking if a field that is defined to blank=True, is_null=True, has that behaviour. It's explicitly defined in the model.

I didn't know that existed, I used loops instead. Thanks
A loop could achieve it yeah, that's how I retry, I just thought a function would be neater
Yes, I'd love to see that also!

Yes, because they are global to each (sub)interpreter. Each sub-interpreter runs isolated from any others. Analogy: a typical Python application might load a dozen or fifty modules. Each module has its own, isolated, `globals()`. Nevertheless, we still call them *globals* even though they are local to the module rather than the running application^1, because the global variables in module `spam` are isolated from the global variables in module `eggs`. Nevertheless, they're still global from the perspective of the functions in each module. Do you have a problem with calling global variables in Python global? If not, then you shouldn't have a problem with calling the GIL "global" even though there is one per sub-interpreter. ^1 Apart from builtins, there is no "really-global" namespace where you can stash application-wide data. And don't write stuff to builtins unless you know what you're doing.

The part about Rust hahaha :D great article
&gt; It seems like a terribly kludgey thing to have multiple interpreters. Do you feel it is a terribly kludgey thing to have multiple instances of a class so that each instance can have its own state and run independently of the others? Why should interpreters be any different? An interpreter can be considered to be an instance of `InterpeterType`. Prior to Python 3.8, all such instances shared that same state and had no proper isolation: (by analogy) every interpreter instance wrote to the same global variables. If you wanted to run two lots of Python code at the same time without them clobbering each other, you needed to fire off two separate processes, or use threads -- but threads have no isolation and are notorious for clobbering each others data.^1 In 3.8 or 3.9, each interpreter instance will have its own per instance (per interpreter) state, so that you can run what is effectively separate Python processes (complete with memory isolation) without the overhead of actually firing up new processes. This is great -- sub-interpreters will fall into the gap between threads and processes: - threads are lightweight, but not isolated - sub-processes will be isolated and lighter weight than processes - processes are completely isolated but have a lot more overhead. I really look forward to playing with this new feature. ^1 Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, I'll use threads." Nothey w hapve robtwo lems.
No, I understand exactly what is being said -- they are global to each (sub)interpreter, not to the entire Python process. Do you have a problem with calling global variables in Python global? If not, then you shouldn't have a problem with calling the GIL "global" even though there is one per sub-interpreter. Global variables are global *to the module*, not application-wide globals that are directly accessible in every module. From the perspective of each sub-interpreter, you still have a single global lock (the GIL).
Sauce?
&gt; developers would have an option to chose: &gt; &gt; compatibility with GIL &gt; no GIL, full multithreading, but broken compatibility They already have that choice, with Jython or IronPython, neither of which have a GIL.
Don't know if sarcasm. In C there a string is an array of chars. If you want to read an input as a string you would go through chars and would know it ended when you came to a '\\0'.

You would actually get a better turnout if you told us what the hell you need help with -- some of us like life without the mystery.
I don't know you, I don't know how good a coder you are or if you know what you're talking about, but in my experience 9 times out of 10 when people complain about the GIL causing them grief or making their programs "slow", they're lousy programmers who would have grief and slow code in GIL-less interpreters like IronPython and Jython. I'm certainly not saying that nobody ever runs into limitations due to the GIL -- and especially not saying that you haven't since I don't know you from a bar of soap. But I'm saying that in my experience, 90% of complaints about the GIL are just scape-goating and band-wagoning. ("Everyone hates on the GIL, so I'll prove my bona fides by hating on the GIL too.")

Just sharpening these chisels here.
Nah to be fair, some of the snakes are bleeding and cut
&gt; 18 years ago, I was doing python multiprocessing with fork() &gt; It has been a puzzle to me why no one else ever seemed to embrace that. Because most programmers are, for the most part, conservative, lazy-thinkers who follow the herd. Everyone else uses threads, languages like Java are optimized for threads, StackOverflow is full of people talking about threads, comp sci and programming classes are full of threads -- so we use threads, because multiprocessing is something weird that only weirdos use. If I had a dollar for every time somebody having problems with threading refused outright to even consider multiprocessing because "threads are the standard solution to this problem", I'd be rich.
&gt; There has to be a better approach. Your patch will be appreciated.
You can already farm out work to other Python interpreters running in their own process, using the multiprocessing module. It even uses the same API as threads. The downside is that launching a new process is quite expensive, especially on Windows. Sub-interpreters fit neatly in the gap between threads (lightweight, no isolation) and processes (heavyweight, full isolation) by being (mostly) isolated but much less costly to launch.
You say that, but I would not be surprised to see that idiot line length come true. Onion said it first, as it were.
It's cool, but why do you feel the need to say that you're 14?

Why not? executing = 5 while executing: try: .... # your call else: break # no exception except: executing -= 1 finally: .... # cleanup???
It's a special reserve for end-of-statement semicolon.

Thank you so much!
Forgot to mention that you need to await it üòä
ok so i did await it.... basically i added this: elif message.content == "db!logmein": await message.author.add\_role(MEMBER) But, got an error: &gt;!Ignoring exception in on\_message!&lt; &gt;!Traceback (most recent call last):!&lt; &gt;! File "C:\\Users\\Matthew\\Anaconda3\\envs\\FSDuck\\lib\\site-packages\\discord\\client.py", line 251, in \_run\_event!&lt; &gt;!await coro(\*args, \*\*kwargs)!&lt; &gt;!

Looks good, but how well will it be backwards compatible with previous versions? How well will downloadable modules (i.e. PyPy, PyGame, Numba) run?
My favourite fruit is pears.
Oh oops! It's add_roles! And you need to define MEMBER with a role object
Ok, i'll try that.
Sorry for the double reply, but how do i "define" member?
Both work, though, since parenthesis around an expression don't change its value.
You can use `discord.utils.get(message.guild.roles, name="MEMBER")`
Oh yeah but how old are you?
In some other subreddit someone criticize you cause you specified that you are 14. I'm working on R&amp;D, but when I see people like you that realize this kind of simulation my only thought is: wow, nice job, I have to study (again). Good job. (ps: I'm 41. The "reverse" of your Age :) )

&gt; If it wasn't obvious, the article is a ~~hilarious~~ joke. Fixed it for you. Some of it was mildly amusing, some of it was bitter and ignorant and frankly disrespectful to the core devs (it didn't come across as affectionate teasing but as mean-spirited mocking).

Enough, people, stop mentioning the age on every other post. Really. Nobody cares.
Def random_picker(my_list): Return my_list.pop(random.randint(len(my_list)) Using pop on the list will remove the element from the list. Alternatively, you could add your selected integer to another list and check if it is in that list before returning. The function above does require the list to be copied from the original
You need to add logic in your function to ‚Äúpop‚Äù the selected value out of list. Eg. when function runs and selects first value, remove that value from list and than select again and so forth.
You could have thought that you have to study more even without OP mentioning his age. This is basically farming for attention. Nobody cares about the age, I have seen younger children do more impressive things. Stop farming for attention.

This is a [Big company] attention farm"? Ps: if someone of my age use his time to develop this my only thought is "good but... what a waste of time! "
Thanks so much, finally got it working.
&gt; Why should interpreters be any different? Because interpreters are traditionally very heavyweight objects with many megabytes of state. And in Python's case, significant initialization time. No doubt the folks working on this new multi-interpreter system will try to improve that. Also because crossing the interpreter boundary is complicated. You say "memory isolation" like it's a good thing, but many programs want to use multiple CPUs operating on the same data. With mutexes and stuff to make that safe. I know folks have tried very hard to remove the GIL from the Python interpreter and failed. It's too bad, lots of other interpreters execute on multiple CPUs just fine. I'm not trying to flame here or disrespect the work of the Python team. I agree this idea will be nicer than `multiprocessing` for many uses. Just noting it might be awkward.

Also sudo() which forces anything inside to work whether it makes sense or not.
It's hard to give specific advice without seeing your current code. The primary thing is to make sure you're using matplotlib's object-oriented interface: if you have more than one call to pyplot, you're doing it wrong. That said, using the same figure window between runs is awkward because your python interpreter will stop between runs and there's no way to keep the reference. You may be able to grab it again by explicitly stating the figure's ID, but I'm not sure.

First time releasing a package on PyPI, a small memoizer library: [classmemo](https://pypi.org/project/classmemo/) I've heard that packaging and distribution is more cumbersome for Python than for some other languages, and indeed it wasn't completely straightforward.

As it is stated in the post, the goal is to create a contract for any developer if they want to add a new model or a field to a model and, as I remember, TDD is not only the coverage of lines but also to ensure the internal structure of a unit. So, while only testing the model might cover all the field lines since there's no behavioral operator such as `if-else`, `try-except-finally`, the developer needs to build up the inner structure of a unit and they need to make sure what a model or field needs to look like or *is formed like* as they write tests and they can implement the model or field since it is a contract between the developer and codebase. It is solved via an abstract base class in the post. Another goal of the post is to prevent *regression* in the codebase. So, by writing tests for your models or fields first, you simply *lock* them in their own state. It anything changes in the model or the field, the tests will fail. So you have to go back to tests to what the model was supposed to be and how your changes has broken the contract. At least, that was what was on my mind when I was implementing this pattern.
A waiter has several tables (threads), and several dishes (Python bytecode instructions) to deliver to each table. Since it sometimes takes time for the cooks (non-Python code) to finish a dish (complete an operation), the waiter can multitask: They can pick up one table's list and fill a few items for that table, then put it down and pick up another list to fill part of that table's list. The Global Interpreter Lock says: 1. The waiter can only work on the dishes for a single table at a time. 2. The waiter can't switch tables in the middle of taking care of a dish. 3. There is only one waiter working at a time. The rules matter because, if we know that only one dish is being taken care of at a time, we know there won't be waiters colliding into each other and getting their dishes mixed into each other ([race conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition)). It works fine when there's only one lane in the restaurant (single core). But if you have multiple waiters (threads), they'd step over each other trying to go back and forth through the restaurant. However, when there are many paths (cores) through the restaurant, there is room to move that isn't being used. You could divide the restaurant up into several lanes (multiple subprocesses or subinterpreters) and have the waiters only interact in certain places (e.g. message passing). That is somewhat wasteful in space (overhead), because you need to construct a way to the kitchen for each waiter (e.g. load up a `list` class object per interpreter). The holy grail is to make good rules for what happens when two waiters (threads) MAY crash into each other (conflict), and how they should act so that it is the same as if only one was working at a time ([serializability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serializability). --- I need to go wash myself now.
**Race condition** A race condition or race hazard is the behavior of an electronics, software, or other system where the system's substantive behavior is dependent on the sequence or timing of other uncontrollable events. It becomes a bug when one or more of the possible behaviors is undesirable. The term race condition was already in use by 1954, for example in David A. Huffman's doctoral thesis "The synthesis of sequential switching circuits". Race conditions can occur especially in logic circuits, multithreaded or distributed software programs. *** **Serializability** In concurrency control of databases, transaction processing (transaction management), and various transactional applications (e.g., transactional memory and software transactional memory), both centralized and distributed, a transaction schedule is serializable if its outcome (e.g., the resulting database state) is equal to the outcome of its transactions executed serially, i.e. without overlapping in time. Transactions are normally executed concurrently (they overlap), since this is the most efficient way. Serializability is the major correctness criterion for concurrent transactions' executions. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
You can use `random.sample` for non-repetitive choices: ``` &gt;&gt;&gt; import random &gt;&gt;&gt; l = list(range(20)) &gt;&gt;&gt; random.sample(l, 5) [11, 12, 0, 9, 2] ``` Documentation available [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.sample).
It looks like you just need to randomly reorder the items. from random import shuffle shuffle(items) for i in items: print(i)
I know you asked for something that runs on a server you control, and this suggestion does not meet that requirement. However, if you're already running in AWS their Cloud watch logs service offers up to 5GB of log processing per month on their free tier.

For some reason that is the funniest thing I've all month.
No.
[It's in the documentation.](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html) Basically it will infer what the dimension has to be based on the existing array and the dimension you explicitly specified. So for example, if you had a 3x2 matrix A and you reshaped it with A.reshape(-1,6), it would infer that since there are 6 total values and 6 rows in the new shape, there must be only 1 column.

I just dropped a QTextEdit with some QScintilla inheritance to make it look like an IDE. It even has line numbers. The code has a backup of dropping QScintilla if it‚Äôs not available. Then I just exec the code when the user hits execute.
After I re-read the scoped-session article: &lt;I&gt;a web application is architected around the concept of a web request, and integrating such an application with the Session usually implies that the Session will be associated with that request. As it turns out, most Python web frameworks, with notable exceptions such as the asynchronous frameworks Twisted and Tornado, use threads in a simple way, such that a particular web request is received, processed, and completed within the scope of a single worker thread. When the request ends, the worker thread is released to a pool of workers where it is available to handle another request.&lt;/I&gt; Looks like I have nothing to worry about. Very contrary to how Java works. Thanks!!

Depends on what your client needs. If they want only some simple things like create, manage articles you can do that. But the safest and fastest option to use some PHP based CMS system. Keep on your mind: most web hosting services only support PHP and MYSQL. So if they want to move a cheaper hosting they can't do that or you have to remake the site with CMS.

GIL "humor" is not funny
I started on a project that uses networkx, graphviz, matplotlib and click to create a graph from a given directory structure and output it to png file as well as overlay over pre existing image and set it to a wallpaper on your desktop using feh. I would love some feedback! Any ideas, comments would help immensely. Command line arguments are building up quickly and I'm not sure its a good idea to add any more. I may look into a config file instead. &amp;#x200B; Inspired by [pscircle](https://gitlab.com/mildlyparallel/pscircle), a similar program that graphs the linux process tree. &amp;#x200B; [https://github.com/niveknosredneh/PFSG](https://github.com/niveknosredneh/PFSG)

That sounds exactly like what I need, could I look through your project?
Yeah. But remember, it turns out all these tech entrepreneurs are lying about how little sleep they get. Studies show that the people who actually get the least amount of sleep are poor people working multiple jobs.

There are six that fit into a gauntlet.
WAIT! How did I not know GIL wasn't per interpreter? Is this new? .... my eyes are opened
"The person who we give our code to is in chains under lock and key. We unlock him to run our code, but the problem is the locks automatically lock back up as soon as there is code to run, and can't be unlocked without it finishing". I mean I know everyone including me is an asshole but us assholes have to encourage questions, not shit on them.
&gt; in general these are not independent calculations. Each fork in the graph represents independent calculations: Let's take `A = B + C` ... B and C can be indepedently calculated (in a directed acyclic graph) but it may not be efficient to do so. &gt; even if I could take advantage of multithreading, it would have been just theoretical. There are concurrent libraries and tools for Python that allow for concurrent computing if I'm not mistaken.
Does it have to be a website? Can't it just be a Python script you run on your own computer?
I'm not sure if there's an extant framework for you, but the stdlib contains curses https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html . With it you can have a GUI within a terminal, which isn't done as much any more but might be workable for you.
&gt;#That sure looks like a lot of boilerplate &gt; Ok, so this example is using the low-level sub-interpreters API. If you‚Äôve used the multiprocessing library you‚Äôll recognize some of the problems. It‚Äôs not as simple as threading , you can‚Äôt just say run this function with this list of inputs in separate interpreters (yet). &gt; Once this PEP is merged, I expect we‚Äôll see some of the other APIs in PyPi adopt them. Am I the only one who sees this as a fundamental problem? Threading and multiprocessing are usable because those modules are decent. It took 6 years for the threading module to be implemented after the respective low level API was. We have 0 clue how long it will take to get implemented. This string based API is nonsense and unintuitive. It will lead to both programming and security issues. It essentially gives a gate to allow people to use a form of input as it was in Py2.X. A proper API (hell, maybe, just maybe, a simple function serializer via inspect, if you don't want to pass around raw Python byte codes), would be far better and safer.
Honestly, you'd be better off refactoring to allow passing of multiple values to the script, then iterate over the parameters and plot them to the same figure in a single run. I'm not sure how you can plot to an existing figure once you've lost the figure handle. There might be some arcane pyQt methods to get the window handle and recreate the figure from that, but it seems easier to just wrap the whole program in a loop and accept a list of parameters. Make it interactive (query user for next parameter set) if you need to adjust on the fly.
I'm not super familiar with curses. Does it have a sort of grid display?
Were the talks from this conference recorded?
Another simple way would be to run a [background IPython kernel](https://github.com/albertz/background-zmq-ipython) in your app. You could then attach via any terminal, and get an interactive Python shell inside your app.
This is a question which belongs to StackOverflow or so. You should ask how to compile your app such that it can run everywhere.
You would use a dictionary... simply add new keys when you have new observations. A dictionary isn‚Äôt a matrix, but why do you need a matrix?
I worded things poorly (kind of on purpose). There is only one interpriter per process, that threads, and anything built on top of threads, locks while interpreting bytecode (AFAIK). Hence the multiprocessing module. Non-python people really don't expect that, especially when coming from compiled languages. This PEP is adding more interpriters to the parent process (AFAIK). So, "more GILs", or, subinterpriters, which should be cheaper and easier than multiprocessing.
Look into influxDB and it‚Äôs ecosystem.
I've heard processes are roughly twice as heavy as threads... doesn't seem that bad to me

Mods, this OP is some kind of blog spam account, frequently posting stolen content. In addition to the post being off topic for the sub. Is there anything new that can be done to improve the signal to noise ratio in here?
I wish we could say the same about \`print\`...
You, sir, are capable of being dangerous.
I am unfortunately not a user of curses, I only know the end results. But: Currently when you're doing your terminal driven interaction you're presumably using print and read_input (or the fancier versions thereof) and interacting with that stream of text. Curses doesn't scroll the terminal necessarily, it allows you to redraw the terminal window. So you can create one persistent frame containing the variables you'd like to track while doing your REPL in a second frame, all in a portable terminal interface. OTOH, having not used curses myself I can't speak to the difficulty here, but it's maybe another avenue, especially if you like CLI applications in general.

Related, but I remember it was easier in older versions of VSCode to go to the python path setting or go to settings.json. Now, there isn't a direct way to go to settings.json or maybe a I missed a keyboard shortcut somewhere.

You may want to have a look at OpenAPI Generator ([https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator)), which just released v4.0.0 a few days ago: [https://twitter.com/oas\_generator/status/1128214723260850177](https://twitter.com/oas_generator/status/1128214723260850177) &amp;#x200B; To generate a Python client, please try the following steps: &amp;#x200B; 1. Download the Java JAR ([http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/openapitools/openapi-generator-cli/4.0.0/openapi-generator-cli-4.0.0.jar](http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/openapitools/openapi-generator-cli/4.0.0/openapi-generator-cli-4.0.0.jar)) 2. Rename the JAR as "openapi-generator-cli.jar" 3. Run the following command to generate a Python API client for the Petstore API ([https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/2\_0/petstore.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/2_0/petstore.yaml)): Mac/Linux: \- java -jar openapi-generator-cli.jar generate -g python -i [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/2\_0/petstore.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/2_0/petstore.yaml) \-o /var/tmp/python-api-client/ Windows: \- java -jar openapi-generator-cli.jar generate -g python -i [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/2\_0/petstore.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/2_0/petstore.yaml) \-o C:\\tmp\\python-api-client &amp;#x200B; You can also generate a Python server stub.

ooohh. Spicy!
Well, I'm pretty sure he's just pissed that even near/after the EOL of Python 2 libraries are still being held back by it.
This was a good read. Thanks for sharing

Not having heard the talk itself, Brown sounds totally reasonable. I've definitely noticed a shift in my own preferences over the years to out-of-core alternatives to the included batteries for various reasons.

Create a fully working website in Flask. Write database models (classes) with inheritance and connect them with the views. Nothing is better proof to an employer than an example of a working application implementing the concepts.
&gt; Guido van Rossum stormed from the room during Q &amp; A. Jeez. I get what she's saying but a bunch of pypi packages become stale or break compability as well. For instance I'm using pysubs2 in a project and it generates warnings because it uses invalid regexes and the maintainer is no where to be seen on GitHub.
I definitely understand the frustration of Van Rossum. The bulk of her arguments completely fall apart if Python 2 is dropped. IMHO, rip off the band-aid. Don't allocate the efforts of Python developers to other people's technical debt.
I don't know if it's Python 3 but check out freecodecamp on youtube
Yeah I'm pretty shocked that this can happen, any university I'm familiar with would at least provide the option of working with a different advisor, or working alone remote from your advisor. Not to mention funding bodies, who don't tend to look kindly on throwing away years of salary... OP, have you posted about your situation on the Academia SE site? They might have some good advice, depending on where you're located.
She started with the right idea, that there are too many outside dependencies with Python, but then she repeated the kneejerk phrase I see here all the time, "The standard library is where code goes to die". Her "solution" to problems with the standard library is to eliminate the standard library. The solution is the opposite - move many of these standard outside libraries, or clones of them, into the standard library. And all the stuff about Python 2 is just silly now that Python 2 is dead. And there really *is* a question of what the point of Twisted is anymore. Just like a clone of virtualenv-tools got baked into Python, it's time to toss clones of Requests and Arrow, for starters, into the standard library. The whole point of adding the daylight savings time flag to the Python time type was supposed to be to add Arrow-like functionality, but I remember the core devs balking about something and then the person who wanted to work on it basically abandoned it and it never happened.
