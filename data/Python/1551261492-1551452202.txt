Thank you :)
looking at the pymunk sample i think you could just modify the variables inside the loop.
groupby doesnt change your original dataframe, &amp;#x200B; try this: &amp;#x200B; In [1]: import pandas as pd In [2]: df = pd.read_csv('test.csv', sep='\t') In [3]: new_df = pd.DataFrame(df.groupby('ID').sum()) In [4]: new_df Out[4]: Billing ID #DSTBs Views Avg FF Avg Rew Avg Pau ID 12345 0.0 2 2 0.500000 0.500000 0.000000 23456 0.0 35 52 1.974026 1.232018 1.520979 34567 0.0 8 11 3.633333 0.166667 0.766667 45678 0.0 3 5 0.200000 0.000000 0.000000 &amp;#x200B;
2. [SqlAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) works well with implementing a number of SQL-based databases, including PostgreSQL.
Nice idea!
Great, I have the output now. However, it only displays - Billing ID, #DSTBs, Views - nothing else. Any idea why? Also, why did you wrap groupby('ID').sum() into pd.DataFrama()? Thanks a lot for your effort!
I have been looking for something like this for so long ! Thanks &lt;3

Invest how? Pay you to take a course? Pay you to go learn data science? It’s possibly beneficial to your company, but it’s a lot more beneficial to you, especially if you want to leave. I’d just experiment with that on my open source project. It’s my proving ground. So now I’m good at it and the business case is easy. It’s not your company’s job to get better at areas you don’t do or conversely relearn things you did in undergrad that you don’t use. It’s beneficial to your career if you do it on your own.

Greg Egan mentioned? That's an upvote.
I think personally if someone was going to convince me seeing a working example would work best, especially if I was not an engineer. For example have a sample csv file with raw data and a finished file which has done stuff to the data. Explain how it takes someone 3 hours to make this currently. Then open a python package, hit a button, make file 'bee bop bee bop'. Then you can say "as you can see because of python I just did the task in 5sec! Investing in python will save time, reduce mistakes, and allow this saved time to be put into new tasks etc" 
Get a quote from Mathworks for Matlab, Simulink, and some toolboxes. Throw that hefty number into one slide. Maybe another slide showing some clip art manager slashing $100k+ from their budget by switching. Throw in a yacht or fancy car just to make it cooler. Disclaimer: use matlab for my job, love it and the fact my employer pays for it :) I also use python. 
I find it strange that you cannot do this with git natively (clone a subfolder). 
I just noticed that if I do: `modified = pd.DataFrame(df.groupby(['SAM ID', 'Title'])['Avg FF'].sum())` The results are printed, but they are way off as some are like this: **0.6666666672.30.8461538461** &amp;#x200B;
I agree. Although I doubt they'll remove venv because as you can see from my comment, 1/5 people think this is the "stupidest thing they've ever seen".
But ... why?
from jupyter notebook to production there is waste without any doubt. Do you do analysis only for yourself?
Tell them that you can accomplish more in less time using pythons, you get quicker solutions or fail faster. The better readability compared to e.g. Java will reduce the overall complexity, enabling your devs to focus on solutions instead of technicalities. (It depends on the problem you are working on though)
Wtf do you need higher management to invest?!
\&gt; need to be convinced to invest time and $$ This is key. In my own experience, convincing managements is about cleverly converting it to money. That is, to convert it to financial value. Take a problem and show how it would be cheaper solved with Python.
Does it clone the entire thing and cp to you the subfolder, or is it actually only downloading file by file? 
You could possibly speed it up by doing all the calculations ahead of time and then looping only through the results. You could use numpy.arange instead of range and numpy.sin instead of math.sin because they are faster at calculations across whole arrays at once. 
Fastest way would be a deliverable od some sort. Not just telling them you saved labor hours or improved efficiency, but just roll out a report or conversion that saves labor hours by empowering business users. Frankly, I suspect a global company has an IT analytics stack in place already and it would make more sense to integrate with that

Yeah, I love the way this thing (turtle) can do different geometrical shapes and stuff. It's definitely a fun little thing to play with. It's probably taken me away from learning to code stuff with Python but it's fun!
thanks for the link!
I love the installation instructions: Step 1: `git clone ....` Errr....Hang on a minute!?!?!
It may sound cliche, but the best way to convince management to invest in Python is to convince them NOT to invest in Python. If you really want to get management buy-in to invest in developing Python skills you need to sell yourself. If you really want to make an impression with your senior management, ask THEM what their biggest problems are. None of them will say Python Ask a few of the more accessible managers for 5 minutes of their time - maybe over a coffee or beer. Ask them what problems they have, wished they could solve/reduce/eliminate. Do NOT mention Python. Do NOT mention automation. Do NOT offer/suggest/think about or otherwise consider a solution during your fact finding discussion. Listen. Do. Not. Think. Listen. Thank them for their time. Do not suggest you have some ideas on how they could fix their problems, or that Python or anything else might help. Once your management has provided you a few examples go back to your presentation (and perhaps to this thread). Look at the problems that they're trying to solve (hint: this is what's important to them, not Python). Now you can give some thought to how you might go about solving those problems. - Maybe they're looking to reduce IT spend? - Improve bottom line margin on the advisory services that you offer? - Shorten sales cycles and increase client conversions? - Reduce outages or technology issues that are pain points internally or blemishes when dealing with customers? Consider the issues, and theoretical solutions to some or all of those problems. Reduce IT spend? - maybe some legacy systems in your business are candidates to move to the cloud, or even to be retired / consolidated altogether. - perhaps your network is outdated and the operational costs of managing it have increased for 10 straight years while the performance has declined in each of them. Improve margin? - maybe your managers are trying to deliver their service with 20% fewer resources. - maybe today they're using a licensed product in your service which accounts for 50% of the cost of goods sold (COGS) in a service you deliver. Sales cycles too long? - technical advisory services require a reputation and trust. Neither of these happen overnight. How could your firm demonstrate each of these: faster, easier, and reliably? - maybe you aren't able to differentiate yourself from the hundreds of other firms that are trying to do this. Reduce outages? - Is your CEO still embarrassed when clients bring up the 4 hour email outage your company suffered last week, month, year? - Or your CTO is still closely involved personally with major changes in the environment because of that last failed upgrade that left your internal systems down for the weekend? Chances are your management are going to be struggling with one or all of these issues. Why? Because that's what almost all managers, at all companies are a) responsible for and b) looking for (better) ways of doing/fixing. Now - the EASY part: Come up with a few simple but tedious solutions to some or maybe even all of the problems your management has shared with you. Do NOT think of this like your trying to cure cancer or invent the next patented product your company can sell/license/deliver on their path to becoming the next unicorn/IPO. * Move to the cloud? Sounds great, but someone still has to do the dirty work. You need to map out the system/application/dependencies. Evaluate the costs (soft, hard and overage estimates of each). Then you've got to actually build the new environment and migrate everything over. - How much money would be saved if the company didn't need to purchase the support contracts for those outdated servers/apps/devices next year because the configuration, data migration and validation of the new environment were automated, reducing the project timeline by 6 months? * Improve margin? Everyone wants to do less with more. But first you have to know what you're doing. How much time are you spending doing: planning, design, implementation? How much time doing testing, troubleshooting or DOCUMENTATION - on average? - How much time ($money$) would the company be able to save if one or all of these steps were automated; marginally (10-20%), significantly (50-75%), entirely? What you really want is for your company to invest in YOU! Unless your company is selling Python as a Service, they're not going to be directly interested in investing in it. They're likely selling you - as a service. Or certainly they bought you to support that. And that's exactly what YOU should be selling. Python isn't going to do your job for you. If it can or does, selling it to upper management is a sure fire way to find yourself out of it REAL FAST. Home builders don't invest in tool belts. Home builders invest in: architects, general contractors, tradespeople, sales and marketing teams or products. The general contractor isn't going to get new tool belts for his team by selling upper management on how good these new tool belts are, or how all the other home builders are using them, so they should be to. If anything that's more likely to convince upper management NOT to buy them. Why? Because if everyone else is doing that, NOT doing it might differentiate them. And if they can still deliver the same product and price WITHOUT buying those tool belts, not only have they saved the cost of buying them - they've given them selves a marketable differentiation. Now if the contractor goes out and gets one of these fancy new (and free!) tool belts himself, and then video tapes one of his guys using it to put up the frame of a house safely, and in half of the time it used to take, a different conversation will be had. If YOU can help the company: save money, increase revenue, reduce costs, eliminate bottlenecks and demonstrably advertise and deliver a better product than their competition, they can and will invest in YOU. And if YOU are - individually or as a contributor in a team - doing many or all of those things by leveraging or expanding your knowledge of Python, you can BET YOUR JOB THEY WILL BE INVESTING IN IT. Sell this. Don't sell Python. (But do use it!) And if they don't? You won't care - because you will be gone, starting your own consulting business or practice somewhere else, where they (or YOU) do. 
Python just makes everything faster and automated. I think giving them solid examples of each of your arguments would be ideal. For example, a while ago, I created a 200 page summary (in pdf form, neatly formatted) out of a thousand row spreadsheet with multiple columns. A task that was supposed to take hours was done in about 20 minutes (inclusive of coding and running the code).
The "applets" on that site actually are \*not\* Java applets, it's all JavaScript + HTML Canvas (I noticed because the applets work on my system, where there is no Java installed).

Don’t delete Python 2. Your Mac probably uses it. Instead, make an [alias](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-useful-bash-aliases-and-functions) for “python” to point to “python3”.
pip3 install --user https://github.com/sdushantha/gitdir/zipball/master
Where is the requirments.txt? 
What sort of project?
.
This is good for scaling by bringing up additional instances. To optimize each instance you would still need to find the best level of concurrency within each VM/Container instance. The optimal number may vary depending of the nature and size of jobs. 
When you say 'default' what do you mean? As in when you want to run a program from the terminal? 
messaged you
Nice, I thought all applets where made in Java. I’ll have to check out canvas.js then. Thanks.
Lol, great author
&gt; it would be ludacris to remove someone who (by his own claim) contributed ~40% of the project over online "conduct" I no nothing about the specifics of this case apart from what has already be linked to, but people do ludicrous things all the time. 
I'm on mobile so i can cant quite tell for sure but it looks like this is just doing a bunch of web requests and not pulling meta-data. If that's the case, you can also do the following, from the desired directory, skipping the python and loops entirely. git archive --remote repository branch:[subdirpath] [files] | tar -x I use this to pull files and complete subdirs from other scripts. The tar extract is slightly dangerous as it's assuming the archive comes as a tar, which it always has for me. You can specify tar or zip to archive on the archive request; it's another flag I've never needed to bother with. I don't recall, but this may only work with the ssh format of a repository url, which will require anonymous access via ssh or public keys on the server ahead of time.
You don't want to delete the system installed version of python, and you don't want to alias the `python` command to `python3`. Either deal with having to type `python3` every time, or alias it to something different like `py3`. You don't want to delete it because your computer needs it. Because it's installed by maxOS by default, it means that every other application can expect that Python 2.7 exists in the exact same path for every single computer running macOS. Deleting it means it won't be there, and your computer would most likely break because it expects it to be there. You don't want to alias `python` to `python3` because of the same reason as above. Applications *should* be written in a smart way so that the system default Python is the one it uses, but application developers are people and people make mistakes. It's much easier to just say "use the `python` command" instead of "use the `python` command from the system default location." Finally, to create an alias for Python, you can type alias py3="python3" In the terminal. This change won't be 'permanent' so to make it 'permanent' you need to edit the file `/Users/[username]/.bashrc` to include the same line as above in it. If you do that you can just close your terminal and reopen it and `py3` will be a valid command.
You’re right. But that Wasn’t my intention while making this. I just wanted to play around.
Nice one ;)
Ooops forgot it. But its there now :D
I am improving my website and getting ready to hold a bot contest this weekend.
Good boi.

To piggy back on this comment, as a company leader, I ask my managers and FTEs to provide a set of practical use cases that will be directly applicable to their day jobs. As with all technology investments, including technical training and learning programs, it is always a solid choice to lead with x number of reasons why y will benefit FTE efficiency while also being cognizant of how it ultimately benefits the company as whole. When presenting your argument for the business case (the python training/learning), try to keep it short, clear, concise, and emphasize the *benefits to the company*. Don’t go overboard with buzzword soup but do hit those keywords if they actually are applicable. Good luck. Python skill sets are in high demand. Just about everyone we hire has some level of python experience. FYI: I’m in the InfoSec space. 
I recommend Udacity to everyone. They have an entire catalog of free courses. Intro to programming is python based. From there you can do Data Analysis and Data Science courses, both Python based as well. Udacity literally changed my life!
Why do you need two loops specifically? [input](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input) is your friend for this. 
Why aren't you using requests to download the file? And instead using url Lib module
I am not really sure how to use requests to download files. If you know how to, would you please share? :)
I thought i was on stackoverflow for a second there. Good answer.
Honest question as I havent used Matlab in years. What do you use it for that you find easier to accomplish than via python?
&gt; so guys/gals who have some expierence with physics simulations, what do you use? I use numpy ndarrays to hold my data and numpy math functions to compute stuff. I take math equations from a paper and then translate it into Python code. I then write a script to put it all together. &gt; how could I reproduce the same applet in the example with Python? IMO first you need to understand the physics, otherwise you don't understand what you're doing and why. From your example, does the following make any sense to you? &gt; This applet performs a very simple, two-dimensional particle-based simulation; it certainly does not come remotely close to capturing the actual physics of the real device. The units of distance are such that the outer radius of the container is 1; the units of time and mass are arbitrary. &gt; The particles have no internal degrees of freedom, and undergo instantaneous elastic collisions when they come into contact with each other; the user can specify their number, mass, radius, and initial velocity. If none of this makes sense (specifically the "two-dimensional particle based simulation" part, or what he means by "undergo instantaneous elastic collisions") then you really ought to just start by learning the physics for it.
No need to beat around the bush. Tell them the truth. Python is good for quickly prototyping, gluing components together, automatically running scripts, building pipelines ... the list is truly endless. The ease of use and high versatility alone warrants its use. In fact I would go so far as calling it the best language out there!
When you're doing requests.get() It returns a response, that's basically the webpage being downloaded. You can use this To get() the url of the file you want to download. And write the response.content() onto a file. Something like this R = requests.get(url) file.write(r.content) It's probably content property of the response, or the one which gives you the bytes data.
So basically numpy for the calculations, but how do you go from calculations to actual interactive animations? That’s what I’m interested in reproducing. And of course you’re right, if you want to do physics simulations you should know some physics. Thanks.
You can do this using GitHub’s svn endpoints…
sure

Will try, thank you
Idle isn't an IDE, it's a REPL. PyCharm is nice but terribly terribly slow. VS Code is drastically faster. I prefer fast and responsive and 99% of the crap bloat in PyCharm is stuff I never ever used anyway, so it just slows down everything for literally no reason for me.
First, have the decency to pay someone to do your homework for you. Second d, ask questions about learning Python in /r/learnpython
So it's basically from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor from functools import partial lots_of_funcs = [ partial(func, *args, **kwargs), ... ] ex = ThreadPoolExecutor() map(ex.submit, lots_of_funcs) but wrapped in a deco? It's neat, because you're using dataclasses, but without any built-in rate limiting, I'm not sure it's practical - especially with your example of interaction with something on the web. I would also recommend you include in the README somewhere that this is py3.7+
Is there a name for the geometrical shape? If there is it eludes me.
Don’t think so. It’s just 3 eclipses joint by lines
hey look i am not asking you to solve the whole question and give me the code!! I am just asking you to give any advice possible for any preferable procedure to follow for answering these question!!!
newb thoughts: convert string to all lowers and then check for "orang" [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6797984/how-to-lowercase-a-string-in-python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6797984/how-to-lowercase-a-string-in-python) &amp;#x200B; Also, r/python is for python related news. I think this might belong in r/learnpython, r/pythonhelp, or something similar 
Put up a slide of Matlab. Laugh for five minutes. Say "Seriously?!" Then click to the next slide with the python picture and walk away. 
Click on the image, or open it in a new tab, then you can
Then see my second answer. When you post to /r/learnpython, don't post your homework assignment. Just ask the question.
 # this ansii code lets us erase the current line ascii and ansi mashup? :)
I don't get why you're pitching a language and not a solution. What problems are you trying to fix? Do you have a development team already that writes in another language that you want to migrate from? If I was an executive you'd have to convince me of these things, not about Python itself.
Haha yep. I'll fix that ;)
Sorry! I didn't know this was for news. Thanks for the help.
You might want to look into Pygame for something like this.
Great material. Thanks.

You mention nothing about the company, the tools that they currently use, the industry nor anything else. As such we can’t even be sure Python makes sense here. Second you do realize that if you rock the boat to hardyou could end up swimming for a new job. Also managements attitude with respect to retraining costs is a huge factor. Third before you can convince somebody else of Pythons utility here you need to convince yourself. That requires being very objective and understanding why things are the way they are. Fourth retraining can easily lead to talent loss. This is a huge factor but the reality is some body with 10 years of C++ experience might easily say screw you and leave for another job. Python has a reputation for being a wage killer, which may or may not be true, but the fact remains experience has value. Fifth do realize that Python can be the wrong language in many cases. Do not make an assumption that the managers don’t know about Python. The subject could have easily been discussed before. I would not bother if that has happened less than 5 years ago. There are also many issues with Python that can make it a no go. For one there is no company behind it. Likewise it isn’t standardized by any standards ds agency. As horrible as it is in some circles JavaScipt gets more respect than Python simply because of a standard for the language. Python has a huge number of bug reports outstanding that frankly can be of concern. Then there are Pythons problems with threads a parallel programming. Management may very well have a different opinion on these issues than you. Python has the yoke of being a scripting language around its neck. People may not realize that there are some huge code bases out there with Python at their core. Allot the things mentioned above might sound negative but you really will not be successful if you don’t understand how the company got to its current state of affairs. Knowledge is power here and that knowledge can tell you if it makes sense to go forward. 
I get that. Does VSC still have basic auto-completion, formatting and debugging?
Downvoting a fellow because they made a question? Shame on you /r/Python. Shame on you. Have an upvote so that justice is reestablished.
Yes, every bit as good as PyCharm if you add the Python add-ons.
Got it. And the code can be ran directly? Thanks so much!!! :-)

Do *you* believe it is worth investing in? Why? There you go. Either you have good reasons or you have bad reasons.
Over 4 years old and requires python 3.4 or less, which is EOL in a month or so
Okk i m removing it !!
This is very inefficient since it'll read the entire file to memory. Prefer: response = requests.get(url, stream=True) for chunk in response.iter_content(4096): file.write(chunk)
`F5`to run the code/start debugger. And now with the latest update you can select code and run only the selected code in the Python interactive window.
I'm definitely gonna check that out, thank you!
Thank you for your comment. This explains a lot to me. Unfortunately, I'm still a bit stuck. It's like my system is not sure when to use python3 or python2. For example, I'm following this tutorial. https://appdividend.com/2018/03/28/how-to-install-django-in-mac/ At step4, installing Django, they request me to use pip install. Some other tutorials tell me to use pip3. Could you, someone with a lot of knowledge, tell me what tutorial to follow to install Django? Please let me know and thank you for taking this time! 
Ayo, if you’re running this on Linux, you need the shebang so you don’t have to write python3 *.py Every time you want to execute the script. I think the shebang would be #!bin/python3 Or something similar. On mobile so I can’t look it up.
I work in government, but I'd focus on my Python projects in the past that automated tedious work, and saved time and effort. For example, my last employer bought a software package that was very important, but had a cumbersome process to update map data. We were a rapidly growing city and needed to update the data bimonthly, but spending 8 work hours on it every two weeks wasn't really an option. With python stuff to update the map data, I took the process from \~6 hours down to 2 hours, and made it more foolproof by automating parts where no decisions needed to be made. (I could have taken it down to 40 minutes, but most of the remaining part was through their interface and they wouldn't allow any script tools access it.) I'd also point out Python's applications and how my Python skills are enough for my work, but it can be a bigger force multiplier if training is implemented across all our mapping people, and growing more python-wranglers to help with automating more of our processes.
I would recommend Pyglet or Arcade simply because they have good documentation for beginners. - https://pyglet.readthedocs.io/en/pyglet-1.3-maintenance/ - http://arcade.academy/index.html
The tool `svn` might already be pre-installed on your system. In that case it's simply svn checkout &lt;github link&gt; where in the link one has to replace `tree/master` by `trunk`. For example, to clone https://github.com/keras-team/keras/tree/master/examples type svn checkout https://github.com/keras-team/keras/trunk/examples

Idk, main thing off the top of my head would be something like pursuing the addition of commercial/enterprise licencing as an alternate means of funding the project. 
This is a talk by the author of this blog post from a couple of months ago at a PyCon event I attended. You can see if you like VS Code for Python. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnOPp4DsY2w
If management are not coders, then show them. Bring in your python car and let them drive car w their own cell phone, while seeing the screen. Then get into the PowerPoint 
This doesn't sound like the issue would be programming really, this you should think of just like you would if this were an algebra class. You are really close to the answer in your question. I'm on a phone so I won't give exact code but think of it like this: The only if statement you need is if the time is over 450 or not. If it's 450 or below price = base price. If it's over 450 it would be price = bp + overage. You know how to calculate the overage. 
You can do it if you want to :)
I advise you to use: #! /usr/bin/env python3 It is useful for example when you use virtualenvs 
Thanks so much! :D
&gt; It seems that there is a lack of these types of projects for those who possess the fundamentals of Python, but haven't put together a complete project. You hit the nail in the head my friend! Thank you for doing this!
Do you have GitHub? 
Sure [https://github.com/jet-admin/jet-bridge](https://github.com/jet-admin/jet-bridge)
I'm not experienced in this but for a small tool I wrote a class as a context manager. This would ensure that if the code breaks for some reason the connections to the database are properly closed on exit. I then just made some class methods for easily creating certain types of queries based on a few keyword arguments. 
More of a personal preference, but I like how everything is pre-packaged by one company and libraries are pretty consistent with input arguments and output. The python installation, especially when you have 2.7 and 3.x can get messy in a corporate environment (especially for aerospace/defense where there is no internet access and you are wholly dependent on administrators to approve/install everything). For some tasks, like machine learning, I think the vast array of python options would be a definite benefit, but I’m mostly using simulink and embedded coder and am locked into that environment (I’m the only matlab user in my group, which consists of all hardcore python 2.7 fanatics/zealots). 
I recommend creating a website via Python Flask. But before that I recommend learning Object Oriented Programming (OOP). OOP is the bread and butter of many programming languages and a lot of web applications as well as systems run behind the OOP model. [https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) The link above provides the essentials for OOP in python from what I can see, (I learned OOP from the Java programming language so I can't help you with what I learned with specifically.) &amp;#x200B; After you've got an O.K understanding of OOP and why it works the way it does (e.g. what is means to inherit parent classes, what an instance is). I recommend moving onto the website development I recommended at the beginning &amp;#x200B; This is a great tutorial [https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) The tutorial above is what helped me create my own eCommerce website and develop my own Ticket portal. (I would sell tickets on my personal website that generates a QR code, and then scan them at the door of the event's that I hold). &amp;#x200B; The tutorial above forces you to use a lot of vital aspects of python that are intermediate level; such as importing libraries, file organization, and OOP that I recommended learning first etc. &amp;#x200B; If you follow the tutorial for the first 9 chapters and spend time not just copying the code but also asking yourself "what does this code", "why does this code do this" etc. and find the solutions you will see yourself improve greatly. Also, web development is not of short demand. &amp;#x200B; From this I recommend after the tutorial trying to create a website yourself with logins, email verification, upload and delete images on the website, etc. &amp;#x200B; If you are not confident about any of the above I recommend either [https://automatetheboringstuff.com/](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) or the official documentation. &amp;#x200B; If you need more guidance or have a question feel free to PM me. &amp;#x200B; Best of luck. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Still trying to figure out how to get around Shopify, Stripe etc. and implement my own Interac eTransfers on my website. Fuck paying fees.
If Microsoft supported Python or Java, they would already be included in the Windows installation. Microsoft is commercial and essentially supports only its own products (such as the .NET Framework, EDGE web browser, etc.). If you want to use Python in Windows 10, you just have to download it and install it. Python programming language has long been a Java language level. Maybe at a higher level than Java. The NET Framework does not have a future because it is applicable only to Windows platforms. Python or Java can be used on many platforms.
Thanks so much!!! :D
The thing is... You are not alone and half python modules are already written in C++. Unless you re implementing an homemade CPU intensive algorithm you'd better look a scipy, numpy, gdal....
1. What "Python compilers"? 2. You can't have an empty method body. 3. /r/learnpython
I think you need a `pass` (or any piece of code) as an indented block under the `__init__`. Your formatting isn't showing the indenting, but I expect the problem is the empty code block.
just requirements of the assignment
im working on a cookie clicker bot xD just learning &amp;#x200B;
Oh yeah! Thanks!
Yeah I had missed the pass keyword. Thanks
Yep! I used to do the same thing for the longest.
Use revenue and/or cost. Everything business related is revenue vs cost. Show how a given tool improves revenue (or reduces cost).
 A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. Python interpreter does not found any block code... but the empty "def \_\_init\_\_(self):" declaration. The code block must be at least one line, even if it is "pass". \`\`\`def \_\_init\_\_(self): pass\`\`\`

1. /r/learnpython 2. It's a method of the string type that substitutes the `{}` placeholder in the filename with the value of `year`.
This is a single line of code that will reduce memory usage a hundredfold. It is also right there in the python-requests [common workflows](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#body-content-workflow). I'm all for good enough, but I'm careful to avoid mediocrity. Plus advertising the wrong pattern might entice people to use your code to download files that don't have a size limit like GitHub does. Running this on a cheap VPS, you **will** run out of memory downloading real-life URLs.

Hi guys, I'm learning python and this is my first "completed" project. At work I have to send our client a list of what was done that day, so we create a new list every day where we drag the tickets into. At the end of the day I run this script, and paste it into an email to the client. It totally suits my needs! &amp;#x200B; Github: [https://github.com/DessoCode/pyExportTrelloList](https://github.com/DessoCode/pyExportTrelloList) &amp;#x200B; Please give me feedback of how shitty my code is. But it totally works for me!
Ohh, that makes a lot more sense. Thanks for the clarification
Python can't replace vba in excel. Python can be used to process work books out side of excel using libraries, but can be difficult for new programmers. But you won't get much interaction in excel and it would be another thing users would have to try and install and maintain and it could be a major pain for you. Start with vba. Get good at the basics with vba. Then move on to real programming with python. Vba is so shit once you move on from it you will really appreciate any other programming language. There are good books available for vba. You can also use the skills from vba as visual basic in visual studio and interop with C# as they share a run time. In fact once you master vba. Learn to use vb as a stand alone language, then learn C#. Vb and C# come with native ms office interop tool. Many ms office extensions are written in C#. I love python, it's my first language but c# always pays my bills
Use xpaths. You can target elements really accurately with them. You can even get a home extension that will make an xpath from an element you click
If I understand correctly, you can use C# in excel? If so, why not just learn C#.
How much? 
This kind of thing signals you might not be qualified for the job. Not so much that you don’t know C# but that you can’t/won’t do some targeted google searches to hack it out. Just a thought 
It's odd that you asked that. I just used ctypes a couple of weeks ago to wrap the stauto32.dll functions and it works great. Keep in mind that I suck at both python and C#, so it's probably not done in the best way. I can post it to github if you'd like. The code I wrote returns the current code on the default soft token and the time remaining for the current code. It assumes pinless tokens, but could be made to work with a PIN(ful?) token. &amp;#x200B; This would require the RSA Soft Token 5.x with Automation, 32-bit.
Used for wrapping existing C libs for use in Python, for example. If you'd like to try it, find a C lib that does something useful that isn't being done in Python and build the C API wrapper for it.

Depends what you’re trying to do. If it’s simple, you can probably just find a VBA solution on the web. Pretty sure anyone following this sub is going to tell you to learn Python though. You’d have to create a macro that executed a Python script then attach that macro to the button. So, you’ll have to touch VBA no matter what. And, you’d have to ensure that the Python script you wrote could run on another machine (depends if you’ve installed third party packages, etc). Even though that stuff is a bit of a hassle, Python can do pretty much anything VBA can do plus a LOT more.
You can't run Python inside of Excel like you can a macro (afaik). However, depending on what you're trying to do it may be a good fit. In particular the Pandas library could be a big help. Pandas can natively read .xlsx and load them into a dataframe, which is like a spreadsheet. You can't really see a dataframe like you can a spreadsheet, and you can't interact with it via the keyboard/mouse. Pandas provides tools for many spreadsheet-like activities (grouping, sorting, summarizing, transforms, pivot tables, etc.), which makes it great for automating repetitive actions. Imagine you get a spreadsheet from your marketing guys every Friday morning and need to do a bunch of work on it for a meeting with your boss every Friday afternoon. Using Python and Pandas you could automate the work and free you from spending Friday lunches at your desk slaving over Excel! Learning Python and Pandas may not happen overnight, but the investment to learn is time well spent.

Data science and ML are highly mathematical things. Why do you think you can teach them to managers? At the end what you taught them is just "Very shallow understanding of things" and some buzzwords . They will know name of things but in reality don't understand them. They will interfere to work of actual engineers and make destructive conflicts. I don't know about python in this situation. But imagine you are developer in company with non technical managers who thinks they know your skill. They think your skill is easy and not really serious. If I were in this situation I immediately changed my stack to other Lang/platform. 
You need your PIN number to get dollars out of atm machines.
Stick to vb since not everyone has python installed. In that case, the macros won't work. 
Either way.. What about a dashboard is impossible in django?
Not the actual dash board it just looks better than any Django work I've seen
Probably better to stick with VBA. I heard a rumour that Microsoft were looking to allow Python in Excel but no confirmation on that yet. The issue you'll have with Python is your users won't have it installed (and your IT Team might not allow you too). Plus you'll need to have the libraries to link it to Excel. Too many things to go wrong. I'd still recommend learning Python but for other reasons.
If you need to do Excel (or any other Office application) macros you need VBA. It’s pretty easy to learn. If you want to learn Python on the side, cool, but it won’t help with your job. 
IDLE is a Python code/text editor. And has a Python Shell included.
I just need my PIN, every time I enter the PIN and a number it fails.
Fortnite is okay
Not wrong per-se, but there's a few things you can do to ensure consistency. 1. Poetry (I've only casually tried it, but it's pretty cool and works) 2. Creating a local 'repo' of wheels of packages. It can even be an NFS directory. Then you don't pull new packages even with libraries you have as dependencies. 
Ah, you used the word “compile”. Does that mean you’ve got some code that is compiled into a module? If that is the case, then things are harder in windows. The version of windows and the exact runtime library is important. If you’ve just got python modules without compiled code, then things in windows work just as well as in Ubuntu. This is result of a couple things (speculating). Microsoft becoming more involved in open source and lots of people forced/accustomed to using windows buy want to use python. Either way, the environments are equivalent for simple python code. 
a .we can use s3 for repo, b. I've had to update the docker file (3.6-slim) manually and RUN pip install -U pip. ended having to downgrade the package to 2.5
You use the C-API if you want to call C code that is already available, ie you have the header files and the object code. If you are writing new C code that you want to call from python, and don't need to distribute it as header files and objkect code, then use cython. There are a few other options as well: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6587407/what-are-the-different-options-for-interfacing-c-or-c-with-python
Like everyone else on this sub I’m of course a huge fan of Python. That being said, I absolutely love VBA and have never understood why it is so widely disregarded as a real programming language. Excel and VBA is a super powerfully set of tools, and getting to really master VBA will definitely pay off for you. You will be amazed by how advanced and efficient solutions you will be able to create and have working flawlessly between many different users. But it takes practice and diligence to learn how to create well performing code. That is true for VBA as for any other programming language. When you master VBA and understand the concept of object oriented programming you will find it relatively easy to transmission into Python.

Does anybody know what terminal they are using for this? It looks really nice
Do we allow advertisements now?
A huge part of Python's standard library is made with the C API (in this case, I mean code that `#include`s `Python.h`&gt;). You can also use `ctypes` to wrap around an existing shared library, or the DLL loader for DLLs. This way you can easily create Python bindings for existing code. The former, however, is something you probably won't ever need; most modules you'll ever need have been written already, and fairly efficiently.
ty, and all the rest can be done with pyAutoGui? that's the way of doing it?

This reminds me of a thing I wanted to do one time! I was enjoying sympy and wanted a way to define equations that define interdependent properties... I wanted to also add inheritance eventually so I could have base classes like HasMass, HasVolume, Cylindrical, etc and have properties automatically respond with a solution if one exists based on the governing equations. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22245061/enforce-algebraic-relationships-between-object-attributes-with-sympy
I have had great success using the python-constraint module - it’s very powerful, and ended up being better out-of-the-box than my (most likely poorly implemented) attempt at using the logpy module implementation of kanren. All you would need to do is define the constraints &amp; then supply the inputs. The order in which constraints are resolved matters though, so depending on which one limits the number possibilities more quickly you’ll want to tweak the order of constraints.
The interface reminds me of discord. Great work. 
We have tools with hundreds of thousands of lines of code in 2.7 and it works (debatable at times). In addition, some started using python back when 2.7 was the “in” thing and have built up sets of helper tools using it over years. We have anaconda and canopy installs, but neither of them has the exact mix of libraries needed (more a problem due to how they imported those packages, I’m guessing). 
Wholeheartedly agree, as someone who's IT overlords have made it near impossible to leverage any external programming language than what ships internal to Office...VBA is an extremely powerful tool, and can typically get you where you need to go. +1 regarding learning this language as a start. But what about xlwings (https://www.xlwings.org)? No personal experience, but looks like it allows you to leverage python functionality from inside Excel?
The 2nd and 3rd answers on my SO question discuss python-constraint. The guy said nevermind because my desire was to solve relationships that have an infinite domain where in python-constraint you have to provide a finite domain. I'd like to be able to solve for mass where volume is like `length * pi*radius**2` for example, so the whole domain of floating point numbers would be needed.
Thanks. Not all heroes wear capes
How can you be a zealot for 2.7? More like people being afraid of change and (probably) not even knowing what the effective changes are from 2.7 to 3. I've now migrated a few small-to-medium sized projects from 2.7 and it's pretty easy.

Mm well I can’t speak to all the specifics that you might be looking to do, but for that use-case I would avoid using constraints altogether and (as in this module) use: ‘’’ @radius.linked @length.linked @linked def volume(self): self._volume = self.length * math.pi*self.radius**2 ‘’’ However, if you were looking to find an optimal solution for a choice such as “what should x part be extended to under y conditions to get the minimal a / b and maximum c values”, even a very large set of possibilities for a large number of variables can be solved much faster than expected. Also, you can do funny things by modifying the \_\_eq\_\_ method of the objects you pass in as domains - you’ll just want to be sure that if you have a domain element evaluate as equal to a variety of values (a range) that you are consistent with that. I made the objects I passed in part of a larger class with “possituples” which would evaluate as equal to a range of values depending upon other values in the class. For something with hundreds of variables and 15 possibilities per variable and many (too many) interlocking constraints, I went from ~2min with kanren to &lt;.1 with python-constraint.

Sometimes I convince myself that I know Python and then I see a post here and remember I have no idea what is going on
Thanks for all the feedback, I'll have to try those out!
Right on the money.
Yes if you could put it on github it would be great, Also yes, I need to put a PIN, I hope it will still work. I have the version 4 of the software tough, I hope its going to work too.
Can you walk us through how you made this? Would love to make a Android app using python!!
But how can I download it without gitdir?
No problem - and lol, the comment history below.
Please don’t. The c api is a major headache for moving the python interpreter forward. There are a myriad of other ways to gain speed: cffi or ctypes to call into c code, pybind11 or cppyy for c++. If you must use the c api, do it via cython which will take care of memory management for you. And you can try pypy. [here](https://github.com/mattip/c_from_python) is a jupyter notebook explaining the use of those packages, based on talks you can find on youtube.
pycharm isn't slow. it does a lot. after the initial loading and indexing, it is fast. and the "bloat" you're referring to are tools. if you don't know what those tools do or how to use them, i understand why you would go with vs code, but calling pycharm slow and full of bloat is silly
If you're not putting any code in the `__init__`, there's no reason to declare it at all. By default, all classes inherit from `object` (in modern python), which has an empty constructor, so you don't need to declare one.
Zealot seems like an accurate description, at least to me, since they never give up trying to get matlab tools replaced with python. That’s an offense that should be punishable by burning on a stake. They are far more knowledgeable in python than me and know and what changes 3.x would cause issues. They advocate for keeping with 2.7, as it’s already tested by the government as an allowed product and would likely cause millions to upgrade/test (space environment). I’m sure if the $$$ came from someone other than the government, it would be a far easier task. I still do a lot of work in Simulink 2013a if that tells you about the environment and how it keeps up with all the cool neighbors (thank you Jesus for windows 10 forcing a bunch of tool updates very soon). 
if you're just getting started, a simple editor (as opposed to an IDE like pycharm) like sublime text or vsc will probably feel more natural and less overwhelming. Overtime you can build editors into resembling something more like IDEs by adding plugins for features you need or want. But eventually you'll realize either you're building an intricate, complex, rickety network of plugins for things that IDEs just do better out of the box, the editor will slow down due to all of the plugins, or you'll not be able to find a plugin that does what you need. When you reach that point, pycharm can't be beat
Compared to VS Code, yes it's slow. Right click a .py and "open with PyCharm". Might as well go get a coffee. Same thing in VS Code is nearly instant. And those tools are nothing but bloat. I don't want or need even half of what they've added over the years. Why should I wait while it loads code to support connecting to SVN or Mercurial when I don't ever use them and never will? Why wait while it loads code to do all the built-in crap it does for databases when most of my projects either don't use a database, or if they do, it's entirely wrapped up with something like SQL alchemy, therefore negating any functionality of those tools since I'm not remotely messing with SQL commands. That's bloat. Plus, if I want said tools, they're still just a plug-in away in VS Code. And if I'm not using that feature then I don't install the plug-in and I'm not slowed down by a bunch of crap I'm never using like Mercurial support. 
Definitely a bot... a few hundred posts on random subs over the last 25 minutes
It's very different from a learning perspective, in my opinion. VBA is tightly integrated with Excel (and other office apps) and is script-like. Using the macro recorder, you can quickly discover how to interact with the document, and because of the script-like nature of VBA you can quickly and progressively "build up" a macro through experimentation. VBA (similar to VB) also cuts a lot of slack to the novice programmer. Unless you specifically turn on the option to prevent such behavior, variable assignments can be done anywhere and intuitively; types are essentially invisible to the developer. C#, while providing a lot more "horsepower" under the hood, is a far more traditional compiled C-like language with strongly typed variables and rigid structure that can be confusing for someone just starting out. While it is true that VBA and C# would use the same interop libraries for interacting with Office apps, the additional requirements (burdens?) of writing C# code can be daunting unless you're familiar with the concepts overall. A good compromise between the two may be PowerShell. You can load up .NET assemblies, still use COM interop, but also have the flexibility of a script style language and "easy" variable assignment. You lose the immediacy of working "in the app," but the handy features built in to PowerShell and the numerous modules you can get for it make up for it I'd say.
From git-archive(1): --format=&lt;fmt&gt; Format of the resulting archive: tar or zip. If this option is not given, and the output file is specified, the format is inferred from the filename if possible (e.g. writing to "foo.zip" makes the output to be in the zip format). Otherwise the output format is tar. You aren't specifying `-o &lt;file.zip&gt;`, so what you're doing is safe. Better to be explicit and pass `--format=tar` though.
I like it, keep it up!

Got it... thanks! I've been using IntelliJ for quite some time on my Java projects which is why I went with PyCharm in hopes that everything would feel familiar which it does.
I think that is going to vary widely depending on personal taste and type of application the code is being written for. Personally I just jam everything in one file for one off scripts, but will give even small classes their own file if I am building a library or application.

&gt; Right click a .py and "open with PyCharm". well, if you're just working on single scripts, then yes, vs code is probably a better fit for your needs. I generally work on larger projects, so I don't find myself opening the IDE that often. once it's open, it stays open, so fast start isn't something that affects people in my position and indexing is seen as a value, not as an impedance &gt; Why should I wait while it loads code to support connecting to SVN or Mercurial when I don't ever use them and never will? that makes no sense. that doesn't happen. it will detect your VCS but that is a one-off check and not something that effects load time because it is essentially `O(1)`. and after that it is stored in the workspace meta data the indexing is what consumes the most time when loading because it is analyzing your code to enable refactoring tools, code navigation, code inspection/linting/sniffing, and a bunch more helpful things &gt; Why wait while it loads code to do all the built-in crap it does for databases also crap. that doesn't happen unless you've set up a database. for some types of projects, it can detect database connections, but that is a simple check like above but slightly more complex though also not something that can discernibly slow load times &gt; if they do, it's entirely wrapped up with something like SQL alchemy, therefore negating any functionality of those tools since I'm not remotely messing with SQL commands. the database tools do much more than sql completion. like I said, if you dont know what the tools are or don't know how to use them, you don't have to, but calling them bloat because you don't want to use them is arguably disingenuous, but claiming they are the reason for the slow-down and miss-portraying their intended use is just lying &gt; Plus, if I want said tools, they're still just a plug-in away in VS Code. from a quick glance at the productivity guide, i use 80% of the listed IDE features (which seems to be pretty incomplete), so it makes sense for someone like me to have native support for what you would need a plugin for in Vs code. also, many of the things you're whining about can be disabled just as easily as you could install a plugin. if you don't need or use the functionality of an IDE, then stick to an editor. that's fine. no one is judging you for it

You’re going to want to use a for loop and loop through that list of numbers. Define an int variable before the loop, if the number currently running through the loop is larger than that initialized variable, update its value with the newest value. Do the same thing with min and you can just print out those values.

Use classes when they make sense. If you're just grouping some functions and variables together, use a module. If your code is representing something with state and behaviour, use a class.
Why the downvote? It’s a legitimate question. Besides in OOP classes generally are for grouping similar methods and variables together.
I don't think he made an android app. Pydroid is an android app that allows you to write and run code in your android phone. For making android apps with python you can look into kivvy and I think pyglet but I'm not sure about this one. There probably others that I don't know about

I built a small lib that glue sympy expr on a dict like data structure : https://github.com/locie/sym_dict The Readme is inexistant for now but the sym_dict is a dictionary with a list of sympy expression. When you add a key, it check if there is a value that can be deduced from the known values and the sympy expression, and fill the dictionary according to that. I use that for dimensionless number conversion for my research, but it will fail in a terrible way if you provide complex expression with numerous root, for example...

 Hey there, Im a person that easily freaks out and I feel quite embarrassed for that so please forgive me for using a throwaway. My friends know me for my awkwardness and constantly finding a way to fuck up my first impression with new bosses. (kind of like that malcom in the middle episodes with hal t the company picnic). My problem: I didn’t prepare properly for the interview and procrastinated. The job requires Python and my friend recommended me to the manager and he may have overexagerated on my python skills. I found a list of commonly asked [python questions](https://www.stratascratch.com/) which was incredibly useful. However I was wondering if anyone here has some tips to decrease my nervousity level and perhaps some tips on some personal questions I should prepare myself for. I suck at people skills which makes me very worried.
You wont get very far as a developer asking for help without giving any sort of effort. 
They’re literally only there for the IDE, toss everything in that will help.
&gt;Why should I wait while it loads code to support connecting to SVN or Mercurial when I don't ever use them and never will? Go to pycharm plugins and disable (Database Tools and SQl plugin, CSV Integration etc.) it if you do not want that feature but anyway if you do not use svn/mercurial then this plugins do exactly nothing and you not wait for anything. Pycharm is indexing and reindexing project when stars so this is slow for a while but this is need to have supperior refactoring and auto completion features.
Excellent... Take a bow 🙏🙏🙏
Nice code but most importantly: monokai theme masterrace.
If it was in feet it would print "38.75foot" haha I like it tho this is cool! Maybe change to feet and add a space for the units?

`print(...)` separates args with a space by default
Lovely expansion to my original comment. Cheers
You don't need those unit variables. You can just change your if to if target == 'm' could also handle uppercases.
Colour scheme, double left menu, menu style and a few other things. Don't worry about it though. I just thought it was mildly amusing
I thought that’s where I posted. :/
Thanks for the help.
 You can use computer vision techniques to do this. In the most simple case you can do pattern matching, but likely you’ll have to use more advanced algorithms. The OpenCV library is a good starting point for this kind of task. They have an image similarity program.Or You van join [Best Python training Company in Noida](http://pythonandmltrainingcourses.com/) for more detailed information.
Nope. You posted in /r/python, not /r/learnpython. Also, I'd say that grouping methods and variables is only one reason to use classes. Object oriented programming relies on the principles of [abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance](http://zetcode.com/lang/python/oop/), and classes help with all of these. For example, as /u/tunisia3507 said, classes can be useful if your code represents something with state. This gets especially useful when you have multiple instances of the same thing and you need to keep their state separately without inadvertently interacting with each other Defining them as instances of a class will keep them separate (encapsulation).
Save your first program and then look back on it by the time you graduate. You’ll be amazed at how far you’ve come 
Great job! Your next step should be to learn about dicts and see if you can redesign this program with that in mind
Monokai is THE best
As the 'bot said, this is the wrong subreddit to ask for help with python. Ask again in /r/learnpython. But note the posting guidelines in that subreddit, which say: * Posting homework assignments is not prohibited if you show that you tried to solve it yourself. If you need help understanding how to approach the problem in general, ask for that. Don't just say "help".
True. Sorry for posting in the wrong place. I guess I should look at the whole sub before posting!
Typically if you have that many if/elif/ else conditions, chances are it can be reduced a great deal by taking any reduncy out. 
For instance, you could use switch statements instead of all the if/else's. 
Pandas has an excel writer function too! 
In the First if Statement u set largest to num77
Python doesn't have switch-case statements though.
Wooooooow
switch statements are for languages without built-in dictionaries and first class function objects :)
That's my fault, been working with Spring as of late so my brain is wired to java. I apologize 
Great job indeed! I wish I had my first program (probably BBC Basic ... those were the days :) ) &amp;#x200B; One suggestion: what will happen if someone enters an unknown measurement either as mode or as target?
He could use dictionary though. Instead of converting from cm to target with "if", he could use something like: converter = {'cm': 1, 'm': 100, 'inch': 2.54, 'foot': 30.48} print(distance/converter\[target\], target)

I've been working on a new Python module inspired by Orteil's RandomGen (yes, i played cookie clicker) which has the purpose of helping with generating random text in a readable way. It's called rrsg (readable random string generation) and you can check it out [here](https://github.com/cabralpinto/rrsg). Being my first Python module, tips and ideas are very much appreciated!
The units variables are used more than once each and it's better to have them as variables instead of using magic strings everywhere. Makes the easier to refactor code

`num77` does not exist. Condition `largest &lt; num` is reversed.
Nah, aligned with the code is better! 
I see a lot of good practices in this script already! 
I literally leaned how to code In python on YouTube. I watched this ‘how to make a game’ series by a guy called Sentdex. Hope it helps
 **Desired Output** Invalid input Maximum is 10 Minimum is 2 
And what you are getting? 
actually im confused with inputs :/ how to get the output
You are printing values to stdout, so output goes to console. I'm assuming you are posting your code to some website. Run it locally (Python interpreter is required). 
pandas require xlrd to read excel files, so strictly speaking it can't natively read .xlsx files :O
I learnt by myself pretty much, by looking at w3school etc. Now 7 months later I've written a fairly big project
Maybe it's just me, but I'm having difficulties to understand it. 
What part is confusing you? I know this is very useful for some projects I've worked on, but I can understand that it might be hard explaining its usefulness.
There are several people producing great content on YouTube. For example, but not limited to: * Corey Schafer * SentDex
I am learning several language on an app called sololearn
Nevermind. I just opened the github link and saw the whole project xD Now stuff was more clear to me Nice job :D

Try to make a value type in Java. Seriously, try to (without relying on the JIT's escape analysis).
/r/learnpython and READ THE SIDEBAR
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar
Hey to know regex walt if you don't already. You could use it to validate input and combine the first and second input in this case. 
I would start over and quickly look up lists. Put all the numbers into a list (once they are validated), and then just run functions for largest and smallest in the list.
How is this a helpful recommendation?
I can still remember my first program completely. 10 print "mrunkel" 20 goto 10 quickly followed by the second 10 print "mrunkel " 20 goto 10 :)
Solve problem with regex! Now you have two problems. :)
Thanks for pointing these approaches. Im learning about asyncio, tornado and trying to figure out if I should go with Tornado or Flask for this. Things make a little more sense now

So i am just a month into python and I love turtles. I am in the launchcode program and everyone has loved using it! I actually just made a turtle controller. instead of hard coding the turtles for each move i have buttons you can click! Turtles are some of the most fun I have had in programming.
I was just about to suggest the same thing
A lot of new users don't read the sidebar before posting. What's your point?
Now let's see if you can create turtle "AI" for your controllable turtle to interact with. Maybe you could learn about key events so you can control the turtle with your keyboard too. Lots of stuff to learn and enjoy :)
Just a suggestion, but multiplication by 1 where you convert all to cm (the else part) isn't necessary. 
Personal fan of Kivy
It is normal. &amp;#x200B; My point here is that posts and descriptions are different. I which I see more Python news and less python pet project. Maybe /r/learnprogramming is more relevant for those posts?
You can combine first and second input (and validate it) just fine without regex.
It's one of those things that will *always* happen. Maybe a solution is to join this sub with r/learnpython and make use of tags/filters to find the content a user is looking for? 
Sentdex is a legend for python tuts
Maybe you didn't read the sidebar either. /r/learnpython is the appropriate subreddit.
Thanks!

Yeah that was left over of my first idea. Will be looking at that stuff later.
Yeah will be taking a look. Thanks.
You could discuss what areas/industries Python is used for. I recently worked with my team to prepare a resource about this: [https://stxnext.com/ebooks/what-is-python-used-for/](https://stxnext.com/ebooks/what-is-python-used-for/) It's \~4500 words long and covers Python for web development, IoT, machine learning, fintech and startups. And it also discusses the advantages of Python in general. Maybe it'll help.
Thanks, only took an hour to work out 😊 
I guess that's exactly what "Report -&gt; Breaks /r/Python rules -&gt; Belongs in /r/LearnPython" is there for.
Does reporting really leads to anything, though? Posts like "I'm 99 old man, start learning Python, check out my project" somehow always get a green light.
Source code???
If you all are interested on the concept of turtles like this, check out Netlogo. It is built to do this exact type of modeling.
Thanks, great write up with a lot inspiration to take into account!
Just leave
Sounds interesting. Might use it on a script I have since it simplifies a lot
Will it even compile with wrong indentation at line 25? Anyway, that's a really good start! 
I'm glad! Syntax might still change a bit before I put it up for download though.
You can clear the console a bit easier with os.system("cls||clear")
It looks like poor dependency injection, also this limits to «sync world», so no async factories.
I did a quick scan of the code and I’m not too sure how it all works. It looks like the comment tree (comment ids) is stored in an in-memory cache. Then that is used to query the dB for the actual comments, which have attributes like parent comment id and depth. 
You're welcome. Glad you found it helpful.
I like stereokai. That's the only reason I don't use VSCode. Sublime has it, VS doesn't 😂
Good job, nice practical first program. Like some others said, check out how dicts work next. It will help you simplify this a lot.
this is really autistic 
Kivy is like a problematic ex lover
Thanks! Unexpected benefits I guess.
don't reply to me autist
I don't wanna get infected 
This is why I love Python. Even if there are stylistic differences and a lot of opportunities for a refactor, every single person here can read this code and understand it. I did some Perl at my first job out of college and reading that code is beyond my grasp now. Great job! Keep learning. Python is a language that will continue to grow with you.
Thank you, very much! I'll definitely check it out!!!
Interesting seeing the highest voted comment is a snarky jab which adds nothing. Honestly it’s a good point. The vast majority of posts should either be accepted as relevant to the sub or downvoted.

Do you think sanic would be faster then aiohttp in this library? [https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2](https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2)
Or create /r/pythonnews or something. People having questions about python will find /r/python before any other python sub, and a significant percentage of those will not read the sidebar. Feels like trying to keep this sub to news only is an eternal uphill battle.
Library and blog post author here. I'm curious what other people in the Python community think about this approach to working with sequences and collections. I've found scalaps to simplify my code, improve readability, and cut down on errors by leveraging the generic algorithms implemented in this library. I'd like to hear what other people think. &amp;#x200B; Very much a work in progress and I'd appreciate some feedback before I invest too much time into this library. Once we're happy with the API, I'll go ahead and clean this up, including developing robust tests and some more examples/documentation. Also, I welcome PRs if you have any ideas. &amp;#x200B; GitHub: [https://github.com/matthagy/scalaps](https://github.com/matthagy/scalaps) PyPi: [https://pypi.org/project/scalaps](https://pypi.org/project/scalaps/) &amp;#x200B; Thanks for considering scalaps!
Yeah. It looks better than some commerical code bases I've inherited over the years
We were both home schooled.
"Software as a service service"
His point is in the post, perhaps you didn't read it before posting 🤔
Maybe it should be \`meters = 'm'\` then. Give them more descriptive names. I don't think it matters that much here though, it's readable anyways. I once worked with code that had stuff like \`CONSTANT\_ZERO = 0\` and \`CONSTANT\_MINUS\_ONE = -1\`. Like, what? In what possible universe is the amount of zero going to chance?
Great job! Ffs. When I started to learn Python I got hooked on Python environments and packaging. The dev tool kit for pythonista's is pretty wicked.
Isn't cls a reserved keyword? I'm surprised you can name a function cls without anything bad happening.
That kind of thing is to make sure you're being consistent with precision. If it's, say, Fortran where 1.e0 is single precision and 1.d0 is double precision, then you don't want to write e or d every single time - if you make one mistake, that's a little rounding error that you don't need. But if you start the code with `ONE=1.d0` or whatever, then it'll be consistent.
Peoples first programs should be screen capture software on this sub
That makes sense. In my case it was just integers though.
Beautiful and clean code.
Same here. TRS-80, entering the BASIC from the book that came with it. Then I learned how to connect my cassette tape recorder and save my code. :-)
/r/screenshotsarehard 
Instead of writing \`float(distance)\` everywhere, just cast once: \`distance = float(input('Enter... '))\`. Also, I would recommend using separate variables to store the distances: \`input\_distance\`, \`distance\_in\_cm\`, \`converted\_distance\` (I'm not good with variable names, but you get the idea). Finally, you only need to call \`print\` at a single place: \`print(distance, target)\`
python doesn't need to compile, but I get what you mean
if mode==target: print(“why do you gave to be such a dick”)
This can only be fixed with proper moderation.
How else will you know I'm an amateur?
Damn, I must've write this when still sleeping, you're 100% correct. Of course I meant to say "run the script".

I would be concerned about a rogue `cls` program on Unixy environments...
Yes, since it's still more indented than the previous line.
I don't mind multiplying by 1 there because of consistency.
You might be surprised to learn `self` is also not reserved
Adding new functionalities to my self-written personal assistent. I love how easy I discover, try, implement, build-on new functionality every day. Managed to write some function (within a few hours), that saves me 5 hours per week!

so what is the drawback?
&gt; Dismissing it as "not pythonic" is just stupid. That designation doesn't accomplish anything. It's just another thing for people to argue about. Sorry...the pandas interface is just horrible and overly complicated.
Only statements are reserved (`class`, `import`, `return`, `def`, `for`, ...), everything else can be changed (`print`, `all`, `enumerate`, `int`, `Exception`, `super`, ...).
Definitely go with Pandas!
&gt; Reply Actually, there are plenty of people who understands what it means. People who think pandas is a reasonably well-thought out library are not amongst them.
Not sure. Though I appreciate that you get it, unlike people who apparently don't know much about software engineering.

While most commentators are correct, I still think xlwings is a very cool project and very usable indeed.
Unless you have a good reason not to, always use python 3. 
r/learnpython is about learning the language and is a place to ask questions. It's technically not a place to share python projects or blog articles about how to do things in python. 
You can try gapread.
We have generally decided that showing off your projects falls under "news" even if the project is crap. r/learnpython isn't appropriate just because you decide that the person sharing should spend time learning to be better with Python. There are a number of problems with moving things to the other subreddit because the projects are beginners. It ends up being a judgment call by the moderators what qualifies as a "real" project and what qualifies as a "learnpython" project. I do code reviews professionally and I'm of the opinion that everyone, from the 99 year old who started their first project to the prodigy who writes their fifth million-installs libraries, should learn to be better at Python. I suggest that of you dislike these projects, you down vote them.

Xlsxwriter, only writes. Pandas by default uses xlsxwriter for its excel exports. 
No, if it’s all online tasks then just use Selenium.

How someone can down vote post "I'm 99 old man, start learning Python, check out my project" ? :)
Yes, because "useful" and "well-designed" are mutually exclusive.
Problem with /r/specificsubjectnews is, for any subject smaller than Belgium my RSS reader and a twitter sub or two are, frankly, superior.
Really? I like it better this way. It helps to break up the code into chunks and makes it easier to read
P3 is successor to P2. Since P2 is widely and deeply implemented globally it’s supported but doesn’t have newer features. If you don’t have to maintain and develop for P2 then go P3.
It does if you’re using CPython. https://stackoverflow.com/a/6889798/2893090
I completely agree with the sentiment and I will probably stop subscribing this sub/going here, because I want to get information about Python, not to see "my first Python project" posts. I think it doesn't belong here at all unless it is a library or something that another person can use in their professional work. I see leaving this sub is the only solution for us :/ Is there any other "real" Python subreddit for the rest of us? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Neon-vomit!!
I'd rather see article-sharing, even self-promoted, if they are good than this project posts.
Someone remembered! :')
Oh, the agony of that read error when trying to load a program. The furious cleaning of the tape head, the praying, the hoping!
You didn't try `10 print "mrunkle";` `20 goto 10?`
I was disgusted lol. I was like "who let me write such an ugly thing" haha.
[https://github.com/XanaDublaKublaConch/pysdtoken](https://github.com/XanaDublaKublaConch/pysdtoken) &amp;#x200B; I'm also fairly new to github/git, so hopefully this works out. I edited the get\_current\_code functions to take a pin and the default pin is "". If the dll function gets "" as the pin, it returns identical values for passcode and tokencode, so it should work for both pinless and pin...ful. &amp;#x200B; In the 5.0 SDK docs, they do mention some of the functions I'm using as replacements for old functions, so I have no idea if this will work with a 4.x token. I may be able to work out something for 4.x if I can find the SDK docs, but I wouldn't be able to test it since I don't have my own ACE server infrastructure.
Out of the three, I've only used pyautogui. pyautogui is basically a library for automating mouse and keyboard inputs. It is **cross-platform**, which is its biggest advantage. It's also very simple to use. pywinauto automates actions in the Windows API, so it only works on Windows. It's main advantage is that it can "read" what controls a certain app possesses, and act on them. For example, let's say you want to open an app, fill in a field, and the click "OK". With pyautogui, you would need to know where the field and Ok button are, and enter their coordinates (in pixels) into your code. With pywinauto, your Application object will have an attribute for the text field and one for the OK button (found dynamically, which is pretty cool).
Actually I didn’t have a computer at home for another three years, and one of my own first in 1985. The two TRS-80s were in the math department of the Jr. high school. There were only two of us that used them, but I remember having to hurry to get the one with 16k of RAM instead of 4k!
learn something new every day! I just thought when I did pandas.read\_excel() it was native. But I had a look at the [source](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/v0.24.1/pandas/io/excel.py#L308-L375) and sure enough it uses xlrd... I usually run pandas via anaconda and that probably installs xlrd along with everything else and never hit that dependency.
Ok
Good first program! I remember my first big program. I built a calculator! Now I think back to it and I know I could make it better but I almost don't want to!

Somehow, the sub's moderator can say: &gt;r/learnpython isn't appropriate just because you decide that [I stopped caring] For what it's worth, while I'm subscribed to /r/python, it's one of those subreddits that I unconsciously consider spam (and I hope nobody's feelings are hurt by my saying that, because it's not a value judgement on anyone, but it is still a fact). It is subject to the same lame bandwagoning "I heard we were doing Xyz" bullshit that other subreddits are saturated with. It really comes down to the karma illness, and honestly it drives away people. The response though, is never an iron fisted one. It is that the sub will slowly sink to the bottom and turn into silt. Crucify me with your downvotes: I have one foot out the door anyway.
Rejoice! I have a tip, though. There are some functions you can call without giving them a space in memory. For instance, wait = input("Press enter to continue.") can become input("Press enter to continue.") This is faster, and uses less memory.
r/learnpython
Thank you for this sane answer instead of the glib one.
That's where you're mistaken, and the fact that you think that is kinda part of the problem. Don't we keep banging on about how Python is the shooting star programming language? Are you seriously telling me that the most popular language of the year will run out of topics to talk about? 
I'm interested, but I don't know anything about Scala. That means your example is impenetrable to me. Can you expand on what this means?
I found the 4.1.2 SDK and the functions look the same, so that's promising.
Actually there's compiling involved.
I'm looking into it, and it seems like beautiful soup wants to remove HTML tags from a raw HTML file. Can I still use it in my situation where I'm not using a HTML file?
How to write C: Write the pseudocode for the program you're trying to make. Convert pseudocode to C. Compile and run. How to write Python: Write pseudocode for the program you're trying to make. Press run. 
Sure. Thanks for the feedback. I'll work on revising that blog post to better explain what is going on.
"Oh man, what would be a productive use of my day? I know, let's insult a new programmer on the internet, that seems like a worthwhile and valuable use of my time!" 
I assume we're reading the same sidebar that states: &gt;News about the dynamic, interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, extensible programming language Python Well, excuse me, but people's pet projects qualify as the programming equivalent of "reality TV". It's just not newsworthy or news. 
Then, if you ever get a job in the industry, notice how you feel about code that's even 6 months old. It'll almost always be something along the lines of "what was I thinking, I could have done it *that* way!" 
I don’t see why not. Its been a while since i’ve used beatifulsoup. There are a bunch if examples on google using regexes to do this too.
I semi launched my first django website thats supposed to be a presentation page of me and my projects i develop / host. When i got apache up and running I developed [IpBlacklister](https://github.com/EliasEriksson/IpBlacklister) to help me add firewall rules to absuive http requests. It uses the [abuseipdbs](https://www.abuseipdb.com/) [api](https://docs.abuseipdb.com/#introduction) to evaluate if an IP should be blocked or not. Now its back to the website and launching some projects! I ^already ^^hate ^^^CSS...
Nice.
Awesome! I like how readable it is. I am learning javascript currently but Python is on my short list
Agreed I modify my scripts as I learn new things so I decided to get a GitHub account and add my scripts so I could see the changes overtime. 
Reducing branch conditions usually makes code more complicated to read. You can get really clever with the logic to make sure it performs the same job, but it becomes less maintainable. Better to keep lots of explicit statements IMO.
how would I go to share a Excel File with a colleague using this?
Any reason why? 
I don't know what you're doing but consider that at some point it becomes easier to use VBA either directly or to export information. 
The unit declaration is a bit overboard if you are using the string values always. 
There is no reason for casting at all. This is clearly Python 3.
This is an old sentiment. /r/pythoncoding was created several years ago in response, but it doesn't get nearly as much content as here (even if you factor out the personal projects), so I've stuck around. But, if there are a lot of people who feel this way, I'd suggest posting/sharing more posts over there. Maybe if it were more lively it would be a viable alternative.
ho and any great cours for real noobs :3 thanks

Pretty sure xlwings should do the trick
Can’t believe something like this didn’t already exist. Definitely useful for organizing the output.
I'm talking about specifically Python news. I mean the official Python websites posts a news article on average every like 5 days. I think there is no purpose of having a subreddit dedicated to *news* on Python when people could just go to the Python website to see the news. I'd rather see this space used as a collaborative space.
The title makes it sounds like they are going to talk about more than on "Scikit". They \*only\* talk about scikit-learn
In addition to everything else here, showing them that their competitors are already investing in and benefiting from similar technologies may be persuasive.

The fiddling with the volume knob...
Agreed. Anything that relies heavily on stdoud (scripts that need to provide the user with a lot of information maybe) can benefit a lot from some organization of the prints. I’ve been using this in combination with flushing stdout and it makes for a really clear view of what my app is doing. 
Thanks. If you don't mind answering. Is the tree structure like a simple nested JSON object?
Comments should be aligned with code and have apace between octothorpe and text, as per pep8

If you can do that much then honestly you should go for some small coding contests. There's an AI contest this weekend which offers a starter code you would need to tweak. Maybe it can help you progress since it's a competitive environment, but with low skill entry requirement: [https://www.aigaming.com/Home/Ip?id=22](https://www.aigaming.com/Home/Ip?id=22)
damned if you do, damned if you dont.
`float(distance) * 1` can just be \`float(distance)\` You can also save yourself time by setting \`distance = float(input('blah blah blah'))\`, that way you dont repeat yourself with all the \`float()\`s None the less, great work for your first time!
I know what most of it does but what is os?
FYI: The proposal to integrate this, [PEP 0572](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0572/), is credited with being the controversial straw the broke the camel's back leading to Guido's resignation as BDFL.
wait... are you and /u/lewistrick serious? The first time I saw this, I had flashbacks to my old tech lead and senior programmer giving me shit for code that had too many (3 if I remember correctly?) if branches (like 10 lines total, 3 each) because it wasn't OOP enough. My very first thought here was... well... basically a series of really harsh criticisms, because that's how commercial development is, isn't it? asking because I haven't done commercial development in like 4 years, mostly because working with those guys sucked.
This reminds me of the hypothetical Javascript package used to deploy malware from the story ["I'm harvesting credit card numbers and passwords from your site. Here's How"](https://hackernoon.com/im-harvesting-credit-card-numbers-and-passwords-from-your-site-here-s-how-9a8cb347c5b5). (Not accusing this package of any shadiness; the source seems very readable; there's nothing akin to JS minimization in python; and it seems much harder within a python script to steal secrets like CC# than in javascript often run in the browser. Just this story came to mind.)
Sorry - this wasn’t meant to be an async module, although it could be with some work. Do you know of any modules which accomplish the same goals without ... “poor dependency injection”?
I think it's more a question of why Julia is not a substitute for Numba/Cython. It is often overlooked that while a number of languages are optimised for writing maths algorithms, the biggest feature of Numba/Cython is \*Python\*. Python is optimised for writing \*everything else\*. In any real application, the maths part is invariable a tiny fraction of the overall software system. Python is the killer feature of Cython / Numba. Being good for writing efficient maths algorithms is a happy implementation detail. &amp;#x200B; (being a bit flippant I know).
On my team we don't give too many fucks about branches and complexity (though perhaps we should). It's more about how maintainable and readable the code is.
Hello world is usually the best place to start
I did this with a project I worked for my colleges theater dept, and nowadays, it's amazing how far along I've come 
r/learnpython and read the sidebar
Thanks for pointing out the shared memory feature. Do you know if not-in-use and not-unlinked memory ever gets cleaned up e.g. not used for a certain time period, all python processes exited? Or is it that if you forget (or an error happens) then the memory stays until a reboot?
Oh man. I have to read about that! Thanks for the link 
Haven't had the chance to browse the source yet -- but if your C's good, there's a [linked changeset](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/e5ef45b8f519a9be9965590e1a0a587ff584c180?diff=split#diff-b493d3266238c43ebe153f314182532c) in [the original issue](https://bugs.python.org/issue35813)
https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html
There is [a page in the Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/design.html#why-isn-t-there-a-switch-or-case-statement-in-python) trying to explain why. Basically, you can always replace then with `if ... elif ... elif ... else` in simple cases, or using dictionaries, which is a more *pythonic* way.
Some sourcecode would be nice, because right now we don't have a single clue what you are doing right now (just what you want to achieve).
Sorry forgot to link it &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; import random &amp;#x200B; print(''' Password Generator ================== ''') &amp;#x200B; chars = 'person', 'into', 'year', 'your', 'good', 'some', 'could', 'them', 'see', 'other', 'than', 'then', 'now', 'look', 'only', 'come', 'its', 'time', 'way', 'day', 'man', 'pie', 'cake', 'hand', 'child', 'meat', 'death', 'week', 'work', 'woman', 'tesla', 'musk', 'back', 'mother', 'end', 'my', 'life', 'python', 'smash', 'sublime', 'kid', 'text', 'chrome', 'suffer' &amp;#x200B; number = 20 number = int(number) &amp;#x200B; length = input('password length?') length = int(length) &amp;#x200B; print('\\nhere are your passwords:') &amp;#x200B; for pwd in range(number): password = '' for c in range(length): password += random.choice(chars) print(password)
Well this doesn't make the life easier. I'd rather have another line of code than this. &amp;#x200B; To think of it, this is how probably the flaming started. Half of the community didnt like the walrus addition, other was for it and boom.
But the point of switch case was to replace if elif elif elif else chains with something more readable and concise. Arguing backwards is silly, you can also replace python entirely with C++ that doesn't mean they pack up shop and cancel the project. It was invented for a reason and has advantages
Wow, use this feature in other languages all the time. It saves a line and you don't have to repeat text twice. 
More discussion here: https://github.com/numba/numba/issues/3814
Personally, I think r/Python could take a page from some of the hobby subreddits. They have a similar problem, where they have a population that's filled with people of all levels, from those who are just getting started to those who have been doing it for decades. One of the things that's worked is having days when posting certain types of posts is not only allowed, but encouraged. In one subreddit, Mondays are for posting your works in progress. Any other day, they're removed, but on that one day, everyone jumps in the sub with knowing what's coming. Also, some require flair so that people can filter out posts they don't care about. This has made a huge quality of life difference in one sub where the game came out with a second version, but lots of people had no intention of moving over. Rather than split the sub, the mods added flairs so that everyone could stay together. After all, while we weren't using the same rules, there was still a ton of shared content between our two groups.
You can make an argument for language bloat, but honestly -- the semantic use cases are fairy Pythonic (even if the new operator's syntax isn't necessarily), and well-defined. This _is_ a feature of other languages, including C, though: char c; while ((c = getc(fp) != EOF) { // do some action on each char in a file until EOF }
Okay well what is your `find()` supposed to do exactly? price = soup.find('data-currency-price data-usd=') `find()` expects a tag name as the first argument. So lets look at the actual HTML &lt;span id="quote_price" data-currency-price data-usd="0.00677045538682"&gt; &lt;span class="h2 text-semi-bold details-panel-item--price__value" data-currency-value&gt;0.006770&lt;/span&gt; So I'm assuming you want to extract the `data-usd` attribute from the first `&lt;span&gt;` tag. The simplest approach is probably to pass the `id` name e.g. &gt;&gt;&gt; soup.find('span', id='quote_price') &lt;span data-currency-price="" data-usd="0.00677045538682" id="quote_price"&gt; &lt;span class="h2 text-semi-bold details-panel-item--price__value" data-currency-value=""&gt;0.006770&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="text-large" data-currency-code=""&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; You can then use *dict-indexing* to extract the value of a particular attribute. &gt;&gt;&gt; soup.find('span', id='quote_price')['data-usd'] '0.00677045538682' 
I guess if we take research programming then there is no much need for everything else. We only get difference in where pieces are joined (JIT compilation vs interpretation) and syntax differences.
I think the community wants these posts (why, I have no idea, but here we are). As we speak, the top post in this sub is a "my first project" screenshot with 400+ upvotes and 100+ comments, while a recent official announcement about a *new version of the language itself* seems to have topped out at 75 upvotes. For better or worse, these early projects is what the people want to see. 
Just a note, /r/pythonnews exists now!

I'm.not insulting a new programmer I'm making fun of the post (it's autistic)
Other than using other well established python package managers, why use a shell script instead of a Makefile?
I think it’s always a good idea to at least do a once over anything that goes into your codebase. JS minimization obfuscates so much that it becomes impossible once it’s in your browser though
Just started learning python, and in 3 days I could do much of it. Unexpectedly easy and fun to do!
What font is that??

Python 2 is End of Life in 2020. I wouldn’t develop anything in Python 2 at this point and what I had in 2, I’d begin porting to 3 if needed.

A clear function was one of the first things I wrote with Python. It's in a module of various functions that I still use 7 years later 
 #Credit for the following function goes to Joe James on YouTube. def gcf (num1, num2): if (num1 &gt; num2): #** num1, num2 - num2, num1 #** for x in range (num1, 0, -1): if (num1 % x ==0 and num2 % x == 0): print(x) In the interest of education and the socratic method, what do you think the lines marked #** do?
People coming from go(lang) or going to go(lang) from Python are going to have a hard time. Anyways, we should give this a go in Python. Go!
I recall doing something similar when I got a second hand Sinclair Spectrum around 2010. 
&gt;don't reply to me autist - You, a little while ago. 
Not a big Sanic fan. Yes, it very fast in benchmarks but Aiohttp is a superior framework with better supporting libraries in terms of security and session management. Is just the much more polished framework in my opinion .
We have [`logging`] (https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) for this use case. Subclass [`logging.Formatter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Formatter) to create the desired string for output, wrap it with an ANSI escape code if color is desired, and use [`logging.StreamHandler`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.StreamHandler) in your config to emit the messages to stdout/err.
Lose what?
Idk if im alone on this but books just dont cut it for me. I learn way more effectively through videos and courses. 
Our sidebar.
I'm not saying the script is perfect. But there are some things that I wouldn't expect a beginner to think about: * assigning variables to the units instead of comparing them to new strings * the command in the cls() function with an inline if/else-statement * comments in the right places Of course, there's a lot to improve, but I'm not going to overload a beginner with technical know-how. They can just enjoy programming for now and mind about PEP standards later.
Userbase of researchers that would choose another tool as it would be better for them (assuming now they use Python). The benefits are not that clear for me. But there is a claim that they are.
First one: checks which one is bigger. If number 1 is bigger, go to the next line. Second one... Does it limit how many times the code on the next part loops so you don't check for divisors higher than either number?
I thought Python 3 was really picky about inconsistent indentation? 
Yeah this is way better than anything I could do my first year as a student, but this would not get approved for a merge anywhere I have worked. 
In Geany I find it messes with being able to collapse blocks of code if the comments aren't indented 
Nah, even at 12 I knew how to spell penis.
I was calling him an autist because only an autistic individual would create such a post
Too late, you're already on the internet, a platform *made* by autists :\^)
Hey OP, I thought I'd refactor (rewrite code, without changing its function) a bit for fun and got these two: https://gist.github.com/DutchmanDavid/084ad60e1bf5c984ac2cc0f7ebea0221 https://gist.github.com/DutchmanDavid/25a7cf688409b7fa7ed4d509c84758cd Perhaps you can learn a thing or two :)
Nice! Small recommendation - instead of the many if/elif statements, just make the units into a dictionary like so: units = {"cm" : 1, "m" : 100, "inch" : 2.54, "foot" : 30.48} This way, the only logic you have to do is: distance = float(distance) * units[mode] distance = float(distance) / units[target] print(distance, target) or even distance = float(distance) * units[mode] / units[target] print(distance, target) So you end up with two lines instead of nineteen and you can easily add more units by simply adding them to the units dictionary.
Can someone explain the need for the first couple of lines?
Google : Greenshot
I prefer using default python venv and pip instead of third-party package managers. And that script uses makefile it's just simplify process of using 5 commands to one.
[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) Regarding this case, the relevant section is: &amp;#x200B; &gt; There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. &amp;#x200B; Note that Rust for instance does not have `switch` either, but has `match` which is in some way more powerful but also more specific and fits nicely in the Rust paradigm. &amp;#x200B; Many languages have paradigms, their own specific way of handling things. For waht it's worth I have worked on more than 100 000 lines of Python and never once felt I the need for a switch syntax, but on Rust I use match in nearly all my files. Different philosophies, different designs, different ways of working. In this post' case, a dict would be the obvious replacement for the many if/else, but in many cases you don't even end up needing if/else at all because other language feature handle the problem beforehand.
Yeah, the main problem is (1) pulling projects from anonymous developers, (2) minimization not necessarily matching public code, (3) large packages taking too long to review (can you really do a once over for a package like django or uwsgi with ~100k LoC especially if you update it frequently), (4) subtle hard-to-detect flaws (e.g., [this code](https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2013/10/09/the-linux-backdoor-attempt-of-2003/); granted these are harder in languages like python), and (5) updates.
Best to ask this in [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython). Good luck!
I'm coding a cognitive model using Python ACT-R. It's for my thesis project. It's an agent that is supposed to play a game (also part of my thesis). Im very excited by it but also very frustrated. 
I second this - puts my first python script to shame.
My only point of feedback I haven't seen yet is not to use cls as a function name out of convention. You'll cringe at it when you go deeper down the rabbit hole.
"well defined" and "Pythonic" are not synonymous. 
I am afraid of autism it's so scary

In this case, they're related: "Pandas is not well-designed, because among other problems it violates these Pythonic principles."
It still needs the dependencies to work, but for small teams it should be trivial to manage. I cannot use it because I don't use excel and it's not compatible with libreoffice.

This is such a horrible feature, doubly so as it uses a similar syntax to the new type hinting crap. I would describe all of the examples given in this video as "bad code" that I wouldn't accept in a PR.
Hi Reddit, My name is Paul. I am a software engineer from Ukraine. Currently, I am looking for a remote Job.

I want see to output ):good luck ^^
You don't need a `pass` statement at line 40. That's reserved for "empty" code blocks. Also, do you know about git yet?
Logging is a really great package. It’s what I used before I made PrintTags. I really just wanted something that was a little less involved. Logging definitely provides more control and granularity, but sometimes you want something a little higher level that abstracts away things like ANSI. Thanks for bringing up logging btw! It’s good to have alternatives present for people who may be interested in using PrintTags. 
You’re absolutely right. There’s no perfect solution. I guess it comes down to trust at the end of the day. 
Thanks! I’ll be implementing a logging solution in the app I’m developing with my partner, so this is great for me. 
Thanks! That was a fun read!
Amen to that.
Type hints are awesome and are basically free. Not using them is a huge mistake. 
You’re using `apt` to install dependencies, so your script will only work on a handful of Linux distros. You could mention that in the README. I’d also recommend doing some error-checking — `set -e` at minimum.
Most of the time, the use of a dictionary is more readable than if... statements, and not longer than a switch. My understanding of *pythonic* is "not surprising", and the fall-through behavior of switch statements (without `break`s) can definitely be confusing. That may be a reason why it wasn't adopted. I'm not arguing against switch statements as I used them often with other languages, but I think it make sense that Python does not use them.
Thanks. Will mention that.
I don't mind the concept, I just don't like the implementation. We use them in our codebase and it's.. marginally helpful.
&gt; For what it's worth, while I'm subscribed to /r/python, it's one of those subreddits that I unconsciously have come to consider as spam /r/Python is the only programming/tech subreddit that I regularly need to dig through low effort, low quality, and low in content submissions. To be fair I think the mods have gotten much better about taking care of the help and beginner posts. It used to be that this sub was full of them and they wouldn't be removed. I regularly report and downvote these posts and when I come back a while later they're nowhere to be found. So as your quote indicates the issue isn't moderator activity, it's their stance on what belongs in this sub :\
The issue isn't whether or not the moderators are aware of the offence. It's that they don't consider these types of posts to be breaking that rule.
Паша, это для обьявлений о позициях, а не завявлений на работу.
&gt; FYI: The proposal to integrate this, PEP 0572, is credited with being the controversial straw the broke the camel's back leading to Guido's resignation as BDFL. Just so people do not misunderstand: it was the aggressive pushback on the PEP and feature which stressed him out of involvement. Guido was supportive of it.
From what I've seen the "Newbie Tuesdays, Show /r/Python Wednesdays" style solutions work out well. I think it would help this sub out a lot. &gt; Also, some require flair so that people can filter out posts they don't care about Last I checked Reddit's wonderful mobile app doesn't support filtering based on flairs :\
&gt; pip install -U moderators &gt; &gt; `OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/lib/python3.7/site-packages/moderators'` 
Came here to say this, this also massively simplifies the testing of all code paths as you’re now testing how your code behaves when a unit exists/doesn’t exist in the dict vs every combination of the tree.

You're right zero doesn't change, but imagine for example working in a computational mathematics program and you had a number like zero that you were trying as a constant in different functions. You could type zero out everywhere and hope that when you change that constant to something that is more meaningful you got them all or you place it in a variable use that variable everywhere and just change the value of that variable. That's more what I was getting at
This code seems pretty non-pythonic. Try using comprehensions over while loops when you can (e.g. replace your grades\_times code with a "grades\_times = \[grades\_coefficient\[b\]\*grades\[b\] for b in range(number\_of\_grades)\]. You can also apply using "range" to the first while loop as well instead of incrementing counter "a".
&gt;33ngineer I will try to work on those parts in the future. Thanks for pointing out those issues, it really helps :) 
Heard of switch statements? Lmao that's awesome
This is Right.
An xml config is still missing though. 
This was your first program? And it only took you an hour to work out?.....
It's probably not wise to post looking for a job in a job offer thread. it demonstrates you didn't / couldn't read the instructions, so anyone contacting you is either as incompetent or negligent as you also, dont post your email address on redidt
Yup, that's what I meant. Thanks for clarifying! 
To each their own I guess. I thoroughly enjoy using Pandas at my job and I also find it very useful. I've also never personally ran into any of the problems the author is concerned about. 
Python has dependencies. If you don't have admin permissions on your computer, which is the case in corporate environments, you can't install it other than having a portable python. Are your users capable of getting it going? (Are there even ones? Haven't touched Python for a while.) I'd doubt it if you have to explicitly create buttons to activate the macros. If your use case for VBA is only some data wrangling then there is not much that can go wrong, but as soon as it gets more delicate you will damn yourself for going the python way. I think of Unicode problems, type problems or some other detail you haven't been thinking of in the first place. That really kills your enthusiasm for using Python. Finally, I don't believe that Python would allow you to do formatting on your Excel sheet. VBA allows you to do that and more, and sometimes your clients/users want nothing more than some automated formatting instead of a billion of tedious clicks. 
As a python beginner myself, could you share an example using enum? I have looked at the link but still confused :(
Downvotes aren't dislike buttons. You're supposed to upvote *relevant* content and downvote irrelevant content. 
Thank you. 
I can't disagree with that!
if you are new, just start with python 3.6 &amp;#x200B;
I'm kinda new to python so my suggestion may not be the best or wrong. As far as I'm aware my solution is called brute forcing what might be something you don't want. In the first loop you could take all results from all pairs of two and see if one of them matches. If that isn't the case you do the same with pairs of three. Expanding the pairs by one every time you haven't got a pair matching the given number. The problem with this is that all solutions stay till the end. A optimization could be that you take the pair of two and copy it as many times as the numbers to generate the given number and just add each number out of the given numbers to each of the copies. Correct me if I did something wrong.

I like it! If you plan on drawing any more, I for one would appreciate it :)
Oh come on, we need more. Everyone wants to build their own PA but not many of us do
Pretty much working on the beginners basics of python. I’m only two days in, with not a ton of previous coding experience, so it’s going to be interesting! If anyone has any tips, anything is welcome :)
I really like Tornado’s default logging options, output formatting and coloring. Wish it was available as a separate module.
So I did have print statements, but apparently it was in the wrong place. I added some log calls throughout the script, and found that the issue was due to the names I was searching for not having a table in my database. That led me to a whole different issue, but at least I got that one part figured out. Thanks for your help.
Agree Completely.
1. /r/learnpython 2. What exactly are you asking for? Are you just trying to memorize what every function in the `os` module does?
The os.walk function has saved my bacon so many times I can't even count. It's indispensable if you do admin work.
Fantastic read thank you. As upper management who likes his tech this is all completely true. The tool belt analogy is perfect. I must remember that
Can u not
Ok so I’ve had a read through it. From my understanding, it’s similar to a dictionary but offers more...protection against overwriting values? I could be totally wrong
Bruh, just found out about f"{}" cool

As someone who would make the call i know i would be attracted to cost and time saving. Ask your own managers though what they need. 
As you deleted the original question I assume you fixed your problem. I believe you had a mistake with the indentation, because the code seems fine to me.
&gt; And IMO that's one of the nicer syntactic sugars in C And by that you mean a disastrous design decision that caused untold number of bugs and exploits? This is what assignment inside conditions gets you. https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2013/10/09/the-linux-backdoor-attempt-of-2003/
Be nice of Python would add a case statement. Every language has one dumbass feature that is only that way because the language developers are stubborn. With python it's no case statements. With golang it's shitty dependency management. With Java it's Java.

I've considered using a separate table to store the ancestry data for easy querying. This confirms it. Thanks!
wow, color me surprised
You missed days 3-6. Wouldn't the fellows at r/learnpython appreciate this a little more? I'm not sure exactly where you're trying to go with this to be honest.
I really recommend checking out an IDE (like PyCharm). It provides you with a lot of tools and quality of life improvements in a single place.
1) If you catch the exception, you won't crash. That's the whole point of exceptions. 2) Please read the first paragraph of the [docs for copytree](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copytree). It explains clearly that "The destination directory, named by dst, must not already exist" 3) rsync can log errors. If you can use rsync it, i would just use it. On windows there are existing utils in powershell like robocopy. This question is more suited to /r/learnpython. Please put future questions thre.
`import os` imports the `os` library which allows you to call functions such as `os.system()` `def cls():` defines a function called `cls` which is called later in the code `os.system(...)` makes a system call as if you were running on the command line `'cls' if` [`os.name`](https://os.name) `== 'nt' or 'clear'` this decides what string will be passed to the os.system function. If `os.name` is `'nt'` (windows) then `'cls'` will be the result of the if statement. If `os.name` is not `'nt'` then `'clear'` will be the result of the if statement. This result is then passed to `os.system()` It's equivalent to: if os.name == 'nt': os.system('cls') else: os.system('clear') &amp;#x200B;
The statement above is one I can get behind!
Arbitrary requirements like that drive code quality down. 
Case statements aren't considered to be very Pythonic and can usually be replaced with a dictionary.
The second one has a typo. As written it's dead code that effectively does nothing at all (try it in the interpreter).
Python has to compile to bytecode, so there is a compilation step. 
I guess my first question before I can give you some advice is why you're wanting to use something asyncio based.
What do you call the process of translating a high level language (like Python) into a lower level language (like the Python interpreter's bytecode)?
Ty werry much for this lil 2 number tutorial xD. Nah I cant memorize that
What is your question?
cleaner than my code
Why := instead of ?= I mean the former doesn’t really get across what’s being done and just looks like Assignment, the later is used in makefiles and is pretty clear in that check a condition, assign a value, in this case check if unassigned, then assign.
 print(f"F-strings are really {opinion}!")
Agree Completely.
Any examples of Tornado’s logging style? I’ve been eyeballing adding some different optional “flavors” for the tags and colors.
"challenge"
 conversion_factors = { "m": 1, "cm": 0.01, "mm": 0.001, "in": 0.00254, "ft": 0.305, } def convert_distance(distance, in_unit, out_unit): to_meter = conversion_factors[in_unit] from_meteter = 1 / conversion_factors[out_unit] return distance * to_meter * from_meter while True: in_unit = input("What unit are you converting from?") out_unit = input("What unit are you converting to?") distance = float(input("What value are you converting?)) try: result = convert_distance(distance, in_unit, out_unit) print(f"{distance} {in_unit} is {result} {out_unit}) except KeyError: print("Unknown unit") print("Supported units are:", *conversion_factors.keys()) Think about this version and ask any questions :)

The PHD students helping us told us that we should just get the code from online, and the code isn't going to be part of the final result anyway we're just using it for the simulation. I figured out that the code making the trail fade is somewhere in these lines but can't figure out exactly how to make it stop fading. trail_secs = 5 max_trail = int(trail_secs / dt) def make_plot(i): ax.plot([0, x1[i], x2[i]], [0, y1[i], y2[i]], lw=2, c='k') c0 = Circle((0, 0), r/2, fc='k', zorder=10) c1 = Circle((x1[i], y1[i]), r, fc='b', ec='b', zorder=10) c2 = Circle((x2[i], y2[i]), r, fc='r', ec='r', zorder=10) ax.add_patch(c0) ax.add_patch(c1) ax.add_patch(c2) ns = 20 s = max_trail // ns for j in range(ns): imin = i - (ns-j)*s if imin &lt; 0: continue imax = imin + s + 1 alpha = (j/ns)**2 ax.plot(x2[imin:imax], y2[imin:imax], c='r', solid_capstyle='butt', lw=2, alpha=alpha)
Why would you use this when python's built in logging module does almost every feature mentioned in this post? I mean like literally.
When it’s up feel free to reply it to this comment, I’ll check it out!
let's just turn this into a subreddit about snakes and get it over with
I basically won't use Python with type hints these days. I've been doing a lot of Go recently though so that might be why. 
I don't like the idea of censoring certain type of post just because majority people dislike that. This idea strips away the diverse nature of the sub. If we start voting on what everybody dislike in here, it will turn out that every single post in this sub is disliked by a few. Strictly defining certain type of post takes away a lot of fun. Personally I have found a lot of ideas from amateurish projects submitted here. &amp;#x200B; That being said, I agree that, we might want to find a better way to filter out posts by types. In some other sub-reddits, I have found that one can filter by categories. That might be a better idea to curate to the audience rather than radically censoring certain type of posts.
Don't use IDEs until you know what you are doing. Also, in interpreted scripting languages text editors with packages can fit the bill. 
We got told all these in class and just became a bit of a logic puzzle for me.
Great first go! Be careful and think through everything when learning Python first. Actual jobs will require adopting and adapting to practices both more difficult syntactically and in implementation detail. Remind yourself why each loop is required and what each value should be in both access (private, public, etc) and type (string, int, etc)
Just googled how to clear the console so that it was clean for every input, and that was what stackexchange said I had to do to make it work on multiple OS.
Let's say your array has 10 items in it, and you remove 2 and now there's 8 My guess is somewhere in your code you've "hard-coded" a static number of loop iterations. By that I mean you have a loop that iterates through that array with something like: for i in range(10): do_something_with_array(i) OR: i = 0 while i &lt; 10: do_something_with_array(i) i += 1 In this case, when you removed two values from the array, it is no longer of length[10] it is length[8], so when the loop gets to "i = 9" it throws an index error. If this is in fact the case, what you'll want to do is instead of hard-coding a loop of 10, you use "len()", something like this: for i in range(len(array_name): do_stuff_with_array(i) OR: i = 0 while i &lt; len(array_name): do_stuff_with_array(i) i += 1 In this way, your iterator will adjust to whatever the length of your array is no matter how many items you remove (or add for that matter).
They do have case statements....
Exactly.
Haha I actually needed that explanation! I just copied that function so that I could get cls working.
Whilst I'm not in need of this myself, it's fantastic work!! I honestly believe this sort of thing is why python is so fantastic, and why so many more people should learn it - the whole 'I can fix this problem through some simple coding' is a great feeling.
I think that the mod is suggesting that the downvote button can be used to register a values difference between OP and and the subreddit mods on what constitutes relevant content.
This reminds me of some of the aspects of Swift that I like. 
Well, I guess I wouldn’t! Logging is one area of Python where I know nothing. 
&gt; ?= is even used for the exact purpose of this in makefiles Yea, the canonical standard for great and intuitive syntax. /s
As the bot has told you, these kinds of posts belong in /r/learnpython.
Oh huh, I didn't even think about it that way. Good point. 
I feel like this and some of the more recent additions in python 3.7, while nice, aren't not huge priorities in my book. IMO these little syntactical changes are distractions from what python really needs to address to give huge gains: Multithreading/concurrent structures. Asyncio is a good start, but a true multithreading system would be killer. &amp;#x200B; Maybe we just need to wait for python 4.0 for those as they will probably be breaking changes for extensions. (See previous gilectomy discussions).
Awe sure thing. Thank you :)
Agreed. All those list comprehension examples are the epitome of "clever code is bad." What an awful PEP.
Is `:=` a superset of `=`? Can I just use `:=` all the time instead?
Sorry, I did not want be toxic. The idea of DI is to deliver object by request and have no deal with object creation, passing initial arguments etc. Request "db connection" and have it without worrying of where db is, what type of db it is. AFAIR your lib do something similar.
God bless you for being able to like a language that has "if let" as a possible combination of words to use
Since I'm studying discovering mathematics (again) I had an idea to try and help me out with Pythagoras. Not really useful but it's better than "Hello World". Any ideas what I could do next?
Nice
/r/learnpython is where you should ask this. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
That still does nothing to refute the fact that := is a weird choice. As if they didn’t care what it was as long as there was an option to do this.
Look at the documentation for plot in matplotlib. (Especially the “alpha” argument)
Whoa, thanks for pointing this out to me! I totally forgot about those rules.
This. There is no need for a separate logging package. 
For my purposes so far (fairly small scripts to automate processes), the scripts would be equally useful under Windows or Linux. One was written and used exclusively in Windows. You can manipulate files using Python in any OS, so when it comes to reading, editing files, that would work just as well either way.
So, from a quick google, the alpha value essentially means how transparent or opaque a graph is. So, if i set it to always be zero that should make the line stop fading?
Extract the body of your if statement into a function to DRY it up.
Literally after posting this question, I figured out the error. The cell is not completely empty. When I opened up the data in the dataframe and clicked on what I thought was an empty cell, I had to hit backspace a few times in order to completely empty the cell. When I reran the code, then that cell got converted to a NaN. Is there a way to detect these "spaces" and then clear them out?
That exact thought crossed my mind. I know doing it like that would end up with much less code. I'm looking at def functions now. Cheers for the comment, hashtagthumbsupemoji
- Ceasar cipher encoder/decoder. - Play with some data in Pandas and a Jupyter notebook. - Read Euclid's Elements and do this again, but on something else that interests you.
I once inherited a 1.2KLOC function that was basically a one massive switch that each case had the same three if statements in them. Somehow I was supposed to make unit tests for each branch, and none of the branches returned anything so I had to track side effects. fml
&gt; the command in the cls() function with an inline if/else-statement Op didn't write that function. Read the end of his title again
This is good so far! A next step would be to implement error/typo handling (just in case the user types something wrong by mistake).

The codebase at my last job had one file with ~2.5k lines of jQuery littered ES5 that one guy had written in 2013. There were lots like this file, but that one was by far the worst. It had stuff in like date formatting using `String.prototype.split`, several different implementations of quick sort, a version of fisher yates shuffle copy/pasted from a StackOverflow thread(I even tracked down the exact answer by googling the function). It also had various duplicate functions in that (rather than re-factor the existing implementation) had just been replace by `functionname_v2` or some such. Sometimes, `functionname_v2` itself was unused anywhere in the codebase and it had just been abandoned in this monsterous js file. Often there were functions in here that we used elsewhere, but they were just copy/pasted in rather than re-used in any way. I asked the guy who wrote it (and continued to churn it out) why he didn't remove all the boilerplate stuff like sort, shuffle, etc. and just use lodash. His response was that he felt the inclusion of lodash would "add bloat to the code base". Presumably in such a way that 2.5 lines of ES3.5 didn't... I still have a photo album somewhere of all this guy's..."greatest hits"
Ceaser cipher sounds like an excellent idea! Thank you.
`:=` is used for assignment in Pascal. Also in [mathematical-style pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode#Common_mathematical_symbols)
You could use [f-strings](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/) inside the print() s. For example, `print(f'The length of a is {c} Units long to {rnd} decimal places')`

```python import this ```
just want to throw out that while you're totally right, it was a nightmare for C, it isn't the same in python because it's very explicitly: the colon makes it clear what you want, and omitting it (as in the case of a `==` gone wrong) is, I believe, a syntax error
python -c “import os; print(os.environ)”
A block must be consistently indented, and more indented than its parent.
Right - but that's not really what's going on with properties. All of the behavior is defined in the owning class, but the actual calling of that code is handled by the descriptor when \_\_get\_\_, \_\_set\_\_, or \_\_del\_\_ are called for owning_object.property_name, as the getter / setter / deleter methods for the property have all been replaced by a reference to the descriptor (which in turns stores a reference to those now-replaced methods) in the owning class. I think the intent and behavior is completely different from DI. The only step I've taken beyond properties is that 1. the property's value is calculated and cached (using code within the original class) the first time it is called and (in the case of linked properties) 2. That cached value is deleted when a value it is dependent upon has changed. All of the logic for that property (calculating &amp; storing its value and defining which properties are linked) is still within the owning class, but yes - a couple of defaults are provided (because they are nearly ubiquitous boilerplates for getting or deleting attributes within the framework described).

thanks, didn't know ";" works as a separator for python
you, as the user, don't need to compile it. you can just run it.
Ya know what, spam sums it up for me too.
My inclination is toward functions on generic structures rather than methods on wrappers, but this definitely seems like a cool library. Stylistically I don't really see the appeal of method chaining, and prefer the approach taken by libraries like [cytoolz / toolz](https://toolz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
&gt; And IMO that's one of the nicer syntactic sugars in C (as much as those are few and far between). Not so sure, given you managed to make a typo ;-)
[Relevant XKCD](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/norm_normal_file_format_2x.png)
Nice, cool work and thanks for sharing
could you explain your first point? im guilty of this. 
They're the best thing ever
Not quite. [`:=` is forbidden as the "top level" of an expression statement](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0572/#exceptional-cases) So x := 1 isn't allowed but (x := 1) is allowed.
Not saying you are doing this, but people often cite this in a sort of judging, "look what you people did to Guido" kind of way pointed at the community. Does anyone know if the community necessarily did anything wrong in voicing their dislike of this feature, or was the main issue just that people had strong opinions and were engaged?
I use python as glue to manage batch files or other programs as part of larger workflows. 
While I wholeheartedly agree with your feeling, you ain't seen nothing till you join /r/webdev. You've never seen more vapid posts about "I've been programming for two weeks and now I'm discouraged. Will I ever be smart enough?" Seriously, it is half IT, half emotional support over there. Like you said, though, the posts get a lot of upvotes
Ah so I thought it's a resignation in a bad way, hard to imagine "resignation" in a good way
So how would you rewrite the series of regex match/if statements given in PEP-572? For example: match1 = pattern1.match(data) if match1: result = match1.group(1) else: match2 = pattern2.match(data) if match2: result = match2.group(2) else: result = None becomes: if (match := pattern1.match(data)) is not None: result = match.group(1) elif (match := pattern2.match(data)) is not None: result = match.group(2) else: result = None The second example looks much cleaner to me since the indentation level won't grow with the number of patterns used.
That Fibonacci example is the most obfuscated method of generating the Fibonacci series I've ever seen.
wait holdup, I'm *way* out of the loop, wtf is going on?
https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace
It'll still be compiled by the Python runtime. If you're saying it doesn't count as compilation if the user doesn't explictly type compile, then what about IDEs that compile and run Java or C++ with a single button?
It's a travesty in my opinion

The pushback was pretty severe and I think he started to wonder if had the confidence of the developer community. Anyway, now Python has the burden of decision making spread more widely, and Guido decided to run as a member of the new steering team, and he was elected, so it's a happy ending. Plus (in my opinion) we still get the new assignment feature, which I missed in Python.
What does cls do?
The dictionary meme is dumb. Literally no one else does that. Like I said, I like python but every language has that one dumb thing they do to be edgy.
Clear console
I think you meant: (lambda f, *strings: (lambda are, *really: f(f'{" ".join((f"f-strings", f"are", f"really", f"{opinion}!"))}'))(f"{opinion}"))(print)
If you're doing this and some part of your program is pure Python, I think the easiest way to do this, assuming you're using something like PyInstaller, is to `import re` somewhere else in the program so that it'll get included when the freeze tool does its thing. Alternatively, for PyInstaller specifically, you can add it to `hidden_imports` [in your spec file](https://pythonhosted.org/PyInstaller/spec-files.html#spec-file-operation) I have no idea how to do this if the whole project is Cython, though.
Wow that’ll be useful thanks
*grabs pitchfork*
Put comments in first as my pseudocode, and yeah I just copied the cls function because I was lazy and didn’t like a messy console. Assigning variables, I’m not sure what you mean. Is there another way to do it? Thanks for the input.
&gt; num1, num2 - num2, num1 # Where exactly is the typo, what am I missing? Also I've tested the code and for me it preforms its job successfully each time, so that tells me that perhaps the code for the lines you pointed out may be unnecessary. 
Very cool! Thanks for sharing!
What characters/codes are there ? Empty space ? Or which character ? [http://www.datasciencemadesimple.com/strip-space-column-pandas-dataframe-leading-trailing-2/](http://www.datasciencemadesimple.com/strip-space-column-pandas-dataframe-leading-trailing-2/)
My lecturer is going to lose his mind at how quickly I am learning through self study at this rate! So many comments, never found a more supportive community on reddit to be honest. Thanks for all the comments. I’ve got a weekend of study from all these comments alone!
I often look for an "Effective Foo" book to learn a language at a deeper level. [https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Python-Specific-Software-Development/dp/0134034287/ref=sr\_1\_2?keywords=essential+python&amp;qid=1551409979&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-2](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Python-Specific-Software-Development/dp/0134034287/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=essential+python&amp;qid=1551409979&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-2) They typically prompt me to ask, "why?" I rarely finish them because by about 1/3 of the way in I've accidentally unraveled enough to keep me busy. I don't claim this will be effective for everyone, but it's a habit that's served me well for a few new languages.
Guido was in support of it, while [29/32 core python developers were against it](https://twitter.com/SerhiyStorchaka/status/1014274554452209665). I feel like this was probably just something Guido had always wanted so he just said fuck it this feature is in and I'm out. It's annoying but not really a big deal- I imagine most style guides in 3 years will just say "don't use this".
I do it all the time. Shrug. 
couldn't you simplify it even further? if (match := pattern1.match(data)): result = match.group(1) elif (match := pattern2.match(data)): result = match.group(2) else: result = None 
That's so crazy. I really do wonder if code review would've caught it. Personally I doubt it highly.
Oh good we're LISP now.
&gt; Does anyone know if the community necessarily did anything wrong in voicing their dislike of this feature, or was the main issue just that people had strong opinions and were engaged? With how they voiced it, yes I think the community did something wrong. This was never going to be anything but an optional feature, if you don't like it you would never, ever have to use it. There was no reason for anyone in the community to have been so against an optional language feature that has a valid use case
Can someone explain why we still use makefiles? What do they do so uniquely well that no tool has been able to replace them in who knows how long?
It's not that drastic. Guido resigned as head of Python (BDFL) last year, but he's still reasonably involved and Python will continue.
That's because it's just a variable, you can name it anything besides a reserved keyword. It's just common practice to use self in classes.
👍
&gt; What an awful PEP. Then just don't use it..... 
OS stands for Operating System, and the os module contains functions for interacting with the operating system.
I had no idea something like that was so easy. I've never heard of osascript before 
Sounds worthy of a post
Oh
Empty space.
The issue is bigger than just one developer. People who will be working with you will be using this syntax. The argument that style guides will ban this is just stupid since that indicates this shouldn't exist in the first place.
The first such script that made was a schedule switch. I could schedule the shutdown of my computer. Helped immensely, since I had to stay awake looking at the progress on something I would be doing everyday back then and then turn off the computer. 
I see people using them all over the place, even when there are no {}s. That's mildly irritating.
Given the code above, I'd define the following Enum: (The StringEnum here is something I define once in just about every project and reuse all over the place. from enum import auto, Enum class StringEnum(str, Enum): def __str__(self): return self.value def _generate_next_value_(name, *_): return name class Unit(StringEnum): cm = auto() m = auto() inch = auto() foot = auto() if __name__ == "__main__": print("Unit.cm: ", Unit.cm) print('Unit("cm"): ', Unit("cm")) print('Unit.cm == Unit("cm"): ', Unit.cm == Unit("cm")) print('Unit.cm is Unit("cm"): ', Unit.cm is Unit("cm")) try: Unit("foo") except ValueError as exc: print('Unit("foo"): ', repr(exc)) The biggest advantage, for me, is the Enum makes your code a little more self-documenting. Instead of magic strings that can so easily be documented, you're including a bit of contextual information to help the reader understand the code. In addition to that, a mis-typed member name become an `AttributeError` exception instead of a silent and difficult-to-debug bug. Personally I use string Enums like this *everywhere* I have a collection of magic strings I need to reference. Things like HTTP methods (GET, POST, HEAD) or API response status codes (OK, ERROR, PENDING). It's a little more work to define the Enum and it requires just a little more typing each time you reference them, but I think it makes the code *much* easier to read and has saved me from countless silly bugs.
I don't really get what you want. Maybe that will fit: question = "What is your name" answ = input(f"{question}:",) result = question + " " + answ print(result)
how tf did i miss that wtf
Very cool.
&gt; This was never going to be anything but an optional feature, if you don't like it you would never, ever have to use it. Right, because 100% of the code I interact with is written by me.
Nice!
I borrowed Effective Python from my local library about a month ago and keep renewing it because it's got some great information. I agree that it's a good choice for improving your Python skills.
So it's essentially an expression passthru? I flip between Python and PowerShell, that's been a feature in the beginning that's usually avoided because it's confusing to non-advanced users that `($var = 5)`will return 5.
A few months ago Kenneth Reitz tweeted “all my strings are f-strings.” With the amount of times I’ve tried to convert a normal string literal to an f-string by adding `{placeholder}` but forgetting the actual f prefix, I’m considering adopting the same policy.
I tried to do EVERYTHING with while loops and elif statements in my first program, a year later I still have problems with not trying a function first. I haven't had the time for actual code writting in the past year that I did in the firat 6 months or so but it's so easy to fall back on the first things you learn when you don't have the time or commitment for daily code writting. 
I’m working on a Pong AI. I started out making a neural network, but it took 4 hours to train so I made a program that, for every frame, predicted where on the y-axis the ball would hit the paddle and moved to that point. 
I'm stuck at 3.6 :(
I mean, I'm totally with you on it being totally opaque, but it's really just a memoized way of computing it under the hood. Yeah, after watching that video I am still not a fan.
That's so true. The core Maths of programs are usually dwarfed by the Input / Data Cleaning / UI part at the front and the Reporting UI at the back. At least with everything I've ever made. The Maths is fun and everything, and I enjoy doing all that as it's often the heart of a program and I get to creative problem-solve, but the rest is what makes most of my clients feel like they hired a professional programmer.
Consistency is good coding practice.

It's cool to me that half the presenters are female. A visible effort has been made at python conferences to encourage diversity and representation of underrepresented groups. I don't know if the organizers had to be selective to achieve their diverse cast of speakers, but it's exciting to see regardless.
Kinda reminds me of Algol a little bit?
I hate having to write two lines to do a regex match. This is pretty much the only thing I miss from my perl days.
SS: Can anyone recommend a good resource to learn about about async design patterns aside from the docs? I am developing a selenium scraping app with GUI using pysimpleGUI, selenium and a custom class to make API requests a remote server. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 
Thank u 👏
I agree. This is the proper subreddit for such posts. Unless somebody wants to start a subreddit r/showoffpython, anything related to Python should be posted here.
So creative! I feel like I always wanted something like this but never realized it 
&gt; Not using them is a huge mistake. https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/typing.html &gt; The typing module has been included in the standard library on a provisional basis. New features might be added and **API may change even between minor releases** if deemed necessary by the core developers. Ok 
The fact that it’s 17 parts is why I’m afraid of regex. 
the fact you NEED a 17 part series on regex says a lot about regex. And why I hate it. &amp;#x200B; But thank you, I'll definitely check it out :)
And increase the volume in the morning to wake you up! 
RIP
Completely works fine. But you might consider range: for volume in range(100, -1, -1): osascript.osascript("set volume output volume {}".format(volume)) time.sleep(30)
Well I had to decompose it to 17 parts to make regex comprehensible so that you can approach it step by step. Otherwise, it can be very overwhelming. :)
When you install Python through homebrew you have installed a different version of the python interpreter, one that your system doesn’t depend on and so you are free to make changes to it without repercussions. From then on, you can pretend the system version of Python doesn’t exist. Whenever a tutorial says to use “pip”, translate it in your mind to use “pip3” **unless** the tutorial is specifically Python 2.7. This goes for every tutorial. pip3 just means “pip, version 3+.” It’s a long story, but basically there were a lot of changes between Python 2.7 and 3.0. The changes were big enough that a lot of Python 2(.7) code would break if the pip command would just start installing the new version, so to ease into that they called the new version pip3 and python3, just to give the new versions a separate name/program so that there isn’t any confusion. Nowadays, We are on Python 3.7 and people have gotten time to fix their code. So now, some OSes are switching back to using just “pip” to mean version 3+, essentially making it the default. So tldr, when a tutorial says to use pip, you should use pip3. However, when you installed homebrew python it might have installed pip3 as pip, so the difference doesn’t matter. You can see what versions you have by typing in the terminal pip —version and/or python —version If it says version 3+, then you can just use pip (because it will run pip3). If it says 2.7, then you’ll need to explicitly use pip3 and python3. Same story for python vs explicitly python3.
this is really autistic 
Is there a window equivalent? 
Lots of these post are also really low effort, either "Hey, I bought Automate the Boring Stuff with Python and I know you love this book so give me all your upvotes", photo of the screen (not even screenshot) with basic code or some gif and few lines of turtle code. Yes, all of us started somewhere and we all were excited when we got our first projects or even simple programs working, but this is getting out of hand. Unfortunately same thing happens in all subreddits where '/r/&lt;topic&gt;' is targeted at experienced practitioners and '/r/learn&lt;topic&gt;' at beginners. Beginners search for their &lt;topic&gt; and immediately post without reading the rules and FAQ.
you should not focus on this very implementation...what op is talking about is one loop with wait, easy to do and that part that changes volume is OS specific...just google how to change volume via terminal and use os.system("volume thingy") or subprocess.Popen("volume thingy")...if you run linux there is amixer (amixer sset 'Master' 50%)
Do you play the music on your laptop or PC when you go to bed?
To clarify, technically Guido hasn't resigned. Guido decided to take a "permanent vacation", yet there is no formal system of a "BDFL" model for stepping down. Presumably if he ever wants to come back, whatever goverance model Python has in the time of the vacation will literally just hand him the keys back. Furthermore, this technically has already happened multiple times. Several times in the bug tracker even after the vacation he has shut down discussion and pushed through his agenda, most notably in the whole master/slave debacle, (which I don't really have a problem with in and of itself, it comes with being BDFL), clearly showing he is not going to be giving up Python in any meaningful capacity.
Ah, sorry. But at least he used a function for it :)
&gt; Guido decided to run as a member of the new steering team, and he was elected So in reality, nothing will change. Not that I mind. Just pointing out that the whole "permanent vacation" thing was a bit of a political move rather than an action one.
Because the resignation was a permanent vacation, even that was unofficial, and it [doesn't matter](https://www.reddit.com/r/python/comments/avsw91/_/ehjerj1), especially as he was apparently voted into the steering committee? For all intents and purposes, he has the power of a BDFL but is telling everyone he doesn't want to be called that.
It's best practice to not put constants (strings, numbers) right in your code. In this example, if OP decided to use abbreviations instead of complete words (ft/in instead of foot/inch) or the other way around (meter/centimeter instead of m/cm), he'd only have to change it once in the code, namely at the top. He could've gone further by also applying this in the print functions.
The fact that assignment is an expression in C wasn't a disastrous design decision, it was a useful feature. The fact that it has the same syntax as assignment and is literally a character away from equality checking was.
It should be relatively easily for a static analysis tool, though.
You're on the right track man! Writing pseudocode first is the best way to let code explain itself if you read it back later. As I said in the comment above, you could've done \`if mode == "m"\` and later on \`if target == "m"\`, but you'd have to change it twice if you'd want to change it to "meter". 
It's only a weird choice when your worldview is Python. It's been used in a variety of languages and is common in mathematics for use in proofs and in psuedocode (albeit, I'd honestly rather write Python than psuedocode).
This is what I hate with 3.X. In general they have thrown the concept of forward compatibility (yes, that's a thing) completely out the window, and severely stopped caring about backwards compatibility (which is the same reason why 2.7-&gt;3.X was a killer.
[Here's a comment summing up your comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/avxmf4/python_script_thats_helping_me_sleep_mac/ehjdfed/) 
People coming from language X to language Y will have a hard time.
Fluent python
That isn't listed in "What's new?". Anything else like that? (Significant, like a module)
On Linux you can just as easily use [pulsectl](https://github.com/mk-fg/python-pulse-control) or [pyalsaaudio](https://github.com/larsimmisch/pyalsaaudio) to do the same, or rely on MPRIS to control the player's volume directly.
Thanks man! Yeah, I’ve been figuring it out as I go so far.
that was really autistic
:)
\&gt; assigning variables to the units instead of comparing them to new strings funny, my first thought when looking at this was – defining `inch = "inch"` just looks silly. Why not use simple short string literals in a short exercise like this? I agree its generally a good practice to define constants and not repeat same string literals all over codebase. But it is not an universal rule, and rules are made to be broken ;-) Anyway, a matter of opinion.
I am learning python for the first time
I disagree. There has been a huge change. Python is now run by community-elected members ... Guido is but one of them. So now there is more representation and there is accountability. Whether it makes python better or not remains to be seen.
Something like this should work. os.makedirs has an exist\_ok argument removes the need to check if the directory already exists. If it does, it will just skip it. The range() also needs to start at 1 and end at 101 (technically, it will end at 100 as indices start at zero) &amp;#x200B; `from os import path` `root_dir = "/Users/dmate/Desktop/Folders/"` `for i in range(1, 101): # Will start a 1 and end at 100` `output_dir = path.join(root_dir, str(i))` `os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)`
 `name 'root_dir' is not defined`
oh shit nvm my bad messed up the code
I'll notify r/rust.
&gt;from os import path root\_dir = "/Users/dmate/Desktop/Folders/" for i in range(1, 101): # Will start a 1 and end at 100 output\_dir = path.join(root\_dir, str(i)) os.makedirs(output\_dir, exist\_ok=True) ok I got it to go with no errors by adding `import os` and now it finishes, but theres not folders created so its not working XD
Rules are only important if you know *why* they're there. I think you saw me explain elsewhere why the rule exists. From there on, it's up to the developer whether he wants to apply it or not. 
This regex interactive tester is all I've ever needed to use/Learn regex. You can get it right for each time you use it and you learn more each time
Yeah, forgot to add the import for makedirs. Try this: ``` from os import path, makedirs root_dir = "/Users/dmate/Desktop/Folders/" for i in range(1, 101): output_path = path.join(root_dir, str(i)) try: makedirs(output_path, exist_ok=True) print('Created directory at path: ' + output_path) except FileExistsError: print('Directory already exists at path: ' + output_path) ``` What does the print output look like?
It prints out `Created directory at path: /Users/dmate/Desktop/Folders/1` and does that 1-100 problem is theres still nothing in the Folder
Working on an advanced to-do list/Trello-lite app to better keep track of everything I have on my plate. While the backend part is a breeze with Django and the Django REST Framework, the frontend is proving to be a challenge. I want it to be a single-page web application and am using React and Redux which I have no prior experience with. JavaScript syntax definitely is a pain in the ass compared to Python.
17 part series, with the first part being 29 minutes. I'm sorry but I don't understand why people are upvoting this. Whoever is watching these kind of videos has a life to waste. You can learn regex by following a 20 minutes written tutorial, then just use a cheat sheet and you're good for life.
The first part is just an introduction which covers: 1. What exactly is regex 2. Maths behind regex 3. Uses of regex 4. Brief history of regex 5. Basic syntax of regex The 1st part doesn't talk about the implementation part. It's just for those who want to know some interesting things about regex.
The effort is to make a detailed series just for the sake of completeness. If you think you can learn **all** regex concepts in just a 20 min. video, you might have pressed the 2x button accidentally. ;)

Is Python GO a new AR game where you collect coconuts carried by unladen swallows?
Exactly, and IMO in this instance the rule does not apply.

I agree. I think anyone watching passively watching videos rather than **experimenting in a REPL** and following along with a tutorial is *crazy*. I think anyone watching 30 minute 17-part videos on a relatively simple subject is *insane*. Here's a crash course: &gt;&gt;&gt; import re &gt;&gt;&gt; re.search(r'(not insane)', 'I am not insane').group(1) 'not insane' &gt;&gt;&gt; re.search(r'((me)*)', 'memes are life').group(1) 'meme' &gt;&gt;&gt; re.search(r'([0-9])', 'not wasting 8 hours').group(1) '8' &gt;&gt;&gt; re.search(r'([0-9]+)', 'not wasting 480 minutes').group(1) '480' &gt;&gt;&gt; re.search(r'([A-Z]+)', 'REPL is active learning').group(1) 'REPL' &gt;&gt;&gt; re.search(r'([a-z]+!)', 'good work!').group(1) 'work!' Regex Meaning x* match 0 or more x x+ match 1 or more x [xyz] match x, y, or z s? optionally match s a|b match a or b Now, go practice. In a REPL. Go. Now. Congratulations, you have learned 90% of what regexes have to offer.^1 ---- ^(1 Now learn a bit more. Then practice. Then learn a bit more. Then practice. Then learn the theory behind finite automata and PCREs if you really love this stuff.)
Seriously. No scikit-aero love or any of the 30 other scikits?
Except refactoring any API changes will be child’s play. Your ide will get you 90% of the way there. 
Well the video series is actually backed by complete set of jupyter notebooks where one can play around with the examples. So you do not have to watch *passively*. https://github.com/nikhilkumarsingh/regex-in-python PS: Not every video is 30 min. long. It's just the first video which became unexpectedly long due to lots of theory. :P
Too long
I love regex. And simultaneously, I hate regex. When I was first learning python with ATBS, I first thought that regex was amazing and that it was the answer to every problem. The more programs I wrote, the more I understood the saying: &gt;Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, I'll use regular expressions." Now they have two problems. I still use it, and it's still magic in the right situations. But I'm equally scared of it and look for alternatives where I can. 
You might be having this impression from the first video which went a bit long because it's about some theoretical stuff. If you want to get started right away with the concepts, you can check out the parts after it. Also, as a reference, you can bookmark this github repo : https://github.com/nikhilkumarsingh/regex-in-python Thanks.
the other, more philosophical problem is that python is supposedly about readable, comprehensible code in which 1 line does 1 obvious thing. Assign and check are self-evidently 2. When I came to python "we don't do conditions and assignments here because it's penny wise, pound foolish and smart-ass for the sake of it" was sold to me as a feature, not as a painful workaround related to specific syntax details, now miraculously solved by the introduction of `:`. I could see it being marginally useful in whiles, but I never had much problem with `while True` doing equivalent shit at the top of its body. I don't like the idea of fishing for : somewhere in the middle of a condition in order to understand the logic. I liked being able to ignore the contents of a condition with the assumption that the state won't change there and I can focus elsewhere. Now this assumption goes out the window. Also this new syntax is not narrow-scoped, you can cram it pretty much everywhere and nest the shit out of it to boot. It will significantly increase the cognitive load of parsing an already busy expression and for what? 1, 2 LoCs less? I dread thinking what people will use it for.
Same was the situation with me and that's why I decided to go through it deeply with examples for each concept and now I'm no longer scared :) Hence this video series came up where I have tried to provide ppl with all concepts step by step with lots of examples. You might be interested in checking out https://github.com/nikhilkumarsingh/regex-in-python.
I’m not that far into the book yet, but ‘Python Crash Course’ contains a project making a web app with Django (if you still want to continue learning some python). I started with ATBS but changed to Python Crash Course quickly, I like the style much better.
an idea is only as good as its implementation and how well it fares in the real world.
I think you shouldn't exit immediately when volume is &lt; 1, but set the volume to 0 and then exit. Otherwise volume stays on non-zero value for ever. If in the future you change your decrease speed from 3 to e.g. 7, you will end up with volume 2 when the script exits. So it's a good practice to set volume to 0 before exiting and not rely on the step size. 
I learnt a lot of interesting things (which I never paid attention to before, even though I used it by help of stack overflow) while making this series like boundary matchers, some interesting compilation flags, multiple ways to deal with backslash problems, look around mechanism, etc.
compiler guys did add a warning for that shit, because it's a naval artillery sized gun pointed at the leg.
I looked more thoroughly through your videos. The material is accurate and clear -- for anyone who already has a working knowledge of regexes. Python regexes and all their intricate features deeply. The main issue is that regexes core features and usage could have been introduced in at most 10 minutes, but are instead spread across many hours of videos. Part 1 is itself 30 minutes and unnecessary for a beginner. Specific examples of what took way too long to be presented: - The `r""` notation is introduced after 1 hour. And it isn't even consistently used thereafter. - `|*?+` are all introduced after 1 hour. These are the bread-and-butter of regexes. It took 1 hour to introduce regexes' *most useful and defining features*...! These are literally what you need to define regular languages. ----- But my post was also a criticism of the "learn-intricate-details-in-a-video-series" format itself. Anyone attempting to learn everything at once rather than *ad hoc*. That is, I only look up `findall` when I need to find all. I look up `re.IGNORECASE` when I want to ignore case. I look up `\b` when I want boundaries. I look up how to overcome greediness/laziness when I discover I need to do so. If I tried memorizing multiple hours of video in any subject... I'd be wasting time.
You need to be careful about the step parameter to range (the 3rd param) because you won't always arrive at 0 at the end. Your script works for -1, but if someone needs a faster decrease, like -15, then the last volume will be 10. Good practice would be to set volume to 0 after the for-loop.
Wait so can you explain what the objective of the game is?
Pls there is paste bin in Pydroid 3 . Please put your code there so the code will be indented properly. Thank you. I will be waiting for the link to your code. 
To inspire my 7 years old girl coding can be fun 
First of all, thanks for going through the videos. I really appreciate the constructive criticism as well. I will also like to clear a few things up though: 1. I do not prefer to use raw strings all the time. I use them only when I really feel a need to use them. Hence, they were introduced for the first time in **The Backslash Plague** video and then rarely in some examples if required. 2. I felt I should open the curtains one by one . Hence, first few videos does not talk anything about +?*|. Only in the 5th part, alteration (|) is introduced. And 6th part discusses the quantifiers (+*?{}). The purpose behind this style of making tutorial is to ensure that a beginner is not overwhelmed by a lot of concepts at the same time. Hence, you learn things in following order, one by one, (without knowing if concepts in succeeding parts actually exist): 1. Pattern object + methods for searching(match,search,findall, finditer) and match object. 2. Character classes 3. The backslash problem. How to escape metacharacters 4. Alterations ( |) 5. Quantifiers (+?*) 6. Greedy and non greedy behaviour of quantifiers 7. Boundary matchers (\b^$) 8. Splitting, Substitution 9. Compilation flags (each one of them with example) 10. Grouping concepts 11. Look around mechanism
Your method of looking up things whenever you need is fine. I also used to do the same until a few days ago. But once I went through all the concepts in detail, I feel more confident while using regex. :) In the end, it's all about personal ways of learning. You should do whatever works best for you.
Pls can I get the source code well indented. I would appreciate that. 
Good work! I wanted to try to make something similar myself, mostly because I think the best way to learn things is to teach it. It really forces you to have a firm grasp on the concepts.
That line just produces a 3-element tuple, with the middle element being `num2 - num2`. It is never assigned and does nothing. The subtraction should instead be `=`, resulting in a swap of `num1` and `num2` (in the case `num1 &gt; num2`). The code works either way, but those lines make it more efficient.
The problem for me ist that a lot of these posts have *no discussion*. There are just posts with links to someone's GitHub, or links to someone's video, or link to someone's blog. Without any discussion. Without any reason about why I should use their code, watch the video, or read their blog. The GitHub posts are funny because on mobile all I see is a big picture of the GitHub user's profile picture. There needs to be relevant discussion, and I think that the thread poster should be the one charged to start it. Furthermore, I'm not sure I agree with limiting the subreddit to just news. I mean honestly, how much relevant and interesting news can there be for a programming language nearly 30 years old? At the same time, people post links to their new libraries and *that's it*. Just a link. 
You need to be more specific. What is it about Frappe that you like? What is it about Frappe that means you can't just use Frappe, if you like it?
Iam actually thinking on using the django documentaion first...but it just the guilty feel to dump the atbs 😂
im just gonna go with django because i have a basic knowledge with python rather than starting back from 0 with js...but might learning it after understanding the concept
Hi. I am a developer/data-scientist at [Kiwi.com](http://kiwi.com/) . We are an *Online travel agency* which means we sell airplane tickets, but are expanding our offers to ground travel as well as holiday packages. What makes us unique is, our search engine combines low-cost airline tickets, buses and trains into single bookings/purchase for the customer, this alone come with a lot of challenges. We like to solve hard problems and have fun with it so we've tackled the [travelling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) and created a feature we call [Nomad](https://www.kiwi.com/stories/kiwi-com-revolutionises-multi-city-travel-with-nomad/). Most of our backend stack is based around Python with some parts in C++ and Go. We are looking for fun, skilled people to help our *Search team* in evolving our search functionality and to distribute our product offerings to the likes of Skyscanner and Kayak. We have also open positions in other teams that for example build tools for our Customer support department to improve customer experience when things such us a delayed flight go wrong. To give you an idea of the size of our engineering, we maintain 500+ upstream APIs (data sources), 600+ downstream APIs. Our search API serves 1000+ requests per second and our custom database computing the solution holds 10TB of in-memory pre-computed data. Our main office is in Brno, Czech republic but we have offices across Prague, Barcelona, Bratislava, Split and some remote engineers as well. I am writing this as an engineer to engineers, but of course we have some official job offers at [jobs.kiwi.com](http://jobs.kiwi.com/) I've been working here for 3,5 years and I can tell you, we've come a long way ;-) Any questions?
No, I mean 17 videos is too long. In my experience regex is something you pick up as you go, not something you study formally like this. 
Alright, here's the deal. People are downvoting you because your post doesn't make sense, and your reply to u/K900_ makes even less sense. All I can say is that if you are asking people for help, then it's in your best interest to make it as easy as possible for people to help you. Don't make people who could help you work to understand what it is you need help with because we all have better things to do. OK, that said, I think that you meant to ask, &gt; "What are some uses for the `os` module? Why would I use it?" So that's what I'll answer. If I misunderstood then well, it's on you to reword your post. The `os` module is there to provide a single interface to Python so that you can manipulate OS-dependent things, with the same interface. The way that Windows and Linux and macOS do things 'under the hood' are of course different, with Linux and macOS being somewhat similar, but totally different from Windows. A real world example is that in Windows, if you use the command prompt, the way to list what files are in the current folder is with the command dir This command works in Windows, but doesn't exist in Linux or macOS. The equivalent command in Linux/macOS is ls Now, if you were making a Python script/program for both Mac and Windows, you **could** do something like, my_os = some_function_to_get_my_os() if my_os == 'Windows': change_directory_with_dir() elif my_os == 'macOS': change_directory_with_ls() You could do that, or you could do this, import os os.chdir() The `os` module will just handle that if/else statement for you. It will automatically detect which OS you are running it on, and it will call the proper command. This means you can write one version of the code, and expect it to work on different OSes. Some other examples: (From here on, when I say Linux, I meant Linux and/or macOS, because like I said it's more or less the same in some ways.) - In Linux to rename a file, you use the `mv` command. In Windows, it's the `ren` command. With `os` it's just `os.rename()`. One interface, works with multiple OS. - In Linux to delete a file it's `rm`. In Windows it's `del`. In `os` module it's just `os.delete()`. One interface, works with multiple OS. - In Linux to delete a folder it's `rm -r`. In Windows it's `rd`. In Python `os` module it's `os.rmdir()`. If you didn't use the os module then you would need to handle all of these different cases by yourself manually, which can introduce bugs and errors. By using the os module, you don't need to do that. You tell Python "do this thing, figure out how to do it' and it does it.
Good job Nikhil! Skimmed through your videos. Excellent stuff, I will definitely go through them over the weekend. 
Well I thought it would be a better idea if I formalized it through a series of videos so that any beginner knows the correct order in which they should learn the concepts. Actually, I felt I was done with this **Learn as you go** approach with regex. Every other day I had to google this concept or other. Hence I thought to go through all the concepts in detail. I got to learn many new things which I had not even heard of, in this process. This video series is intended for anyone who want a comprehensive understanding of regex. One can also check out a specific video if they want to learn a single concept like boundary matchers, compilation flags, grouping, look around, etc.
Thanks a lot. :)
Where were empty voids at all? :) Is there a problem with data input when entering data into a table? Just after each data import, clear the spreadsheet. Or only when entering data into a table and when reading data. Using the str.strip() method. This problem has been solved all over the world, just search Google: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33788913/pythonic-efficient-way-to-strip-whitespace-from-every-pandas-data-frame-cell-tha](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33788913/pythonic-efficient-way-to-strip-whitespace-from-every-pandas-data-frame-cell-tha)
Flask?
I admire anyone who can put out 17 videos on something as dry as regex. Keep up the great work. 
Are you developing this on an android phone? Could you please share following information on any of the following you are using: Code/Text Editor SDK Graphics Library
Flask does very well for such projects. Plenty of examples for such use cases on Github.
Very nice! Thanks! An alternative I used so far: [https://regexr.com/](https://regexr.com/) &amp;#x200B;
you don't need 17 part series to become familiar with regex 90% of regex is - `.`, `^`, `$` - character classes like [abc] or \w - `?`, `*`, `+`, `{n, m}` difference between greedy and non-greedy behavior - capturing groups - alternatives using `|` - some escaping rules for disambiguation
That's great, thanks. I'll take a look at flask 
I'm using the android app Pydroid3 IDE for learning the python 
Lol. I myself was a bit surprised when I finished the documentation for this series. I was expecting only 4-5 videos in this series before I actually sat down to work. 
He is using Pydriod3 to write Python codes
I've always found regex is like chess: a mosquito can sip from it, an elephant can drown in it.
Honestly: you don't need a 17 part video series about regex. Read a bit on the basic concept and use a tester when you use regex (Like for example 101regex or something like that)
Well-indented is the only way Python works. 
This site is far better imo. Railroad diagrams make it super easy to understand even really convoluted and long regexs. https://regexper.com/
I still domt understand!
I'd add lookahead conditions to that list but otherwise that's spot on.
What I learned in my [Python training in Noida](http://pythonandmltrainingcourses.com/) Python provides two levels of access to network services. At a low level, you can access the basic socket support in the underlying operating system, which allows you to implement clients and servers for both connection-oriented and connectionless protocols. Python also has libraries that provide higher-level access to specific application-level network protocols, such as FTP, HTTP, and so on. This chapter gives you understanding on most famous concept in Networking - Socket Programming.
Who are these regex haters? Get a regex cheat sheet. It's only one page. I don't remember the name of the website but you can google it. 
So Pydroid3 is an IDE that runs on your phone? I can barely type my name on my phone, I couldn't imagine programming on it. Do you use an external keyboard? device larger than phone? 
Yes, a lot. It's more convenient. Don't really see a reason to use `os.path` now.

You should try listening to feedback rather than passive-aggressively arguing with it
I suspect you'd have to calculate all possible solutions and then work out which one is the shortest - I'd probably look at dumping all results into a dictionary, with length as the key. Then once I've got all solutions, sort the dictionary by keys and pick the value from the first key. As an aside, I don't know if you've noticed but looking at Testcase 2, the only way to get a result of 1 would be to use subtraction. So either you can combine numbers using any operator to get the result, or Testcase 2 should generate a result of 0. Either way I'd recommend reading the competition's wording very carefully!!
Yeah... I have been trying to indent the source code he sent but I am not getting what he posted here. 
Why? What are you trying to achieve by doing this?
Well I actually listened to your feedback and gave you my opinion on why I don't completely agree with your statement about not studying the subject formally.
ok
Hey! great refactor!
phrase = "no u" print("phrase") &amp;#x200B; I'm starting to understand it
Yes, thats the next step! For me personally, I want to mask my roommates noise in the morning, so I'm gonna try increasing rain sounds slowly enough to not wake me up, but fast enough to mask his noise between 7-8 am.
Yup, laptop.
I am taking a dymo scale’s weight from the users computer and reading it into a django application.
No 1 rule of regex: stop fucking using regex. You can replicate the functionality in a sane readable manner. No seriously,you're on a slippery slope.
Just like you can Google any regex to find out why that regex isn't accurate enough for the problem it's solving
regex is here to stay, mate. :)
But why are you doing it with a web server of all things?
I have never used a lookahead. I don't recognize lookahead to be pure regex. Lookaheads allow regex to recognize non-regular languages. And as the name implies, regular languages are what regex is made for. If you need a lookahead, you're probably trying to solve a problem with regex that should be parsed another way.
Thank you. Cool project
Yeah everyone knows all of that,now try parsing any regex expression on the fly while you're debugging code and wondering why the regex matches things it's not supposed to. Regex is good for being lazy about pattern matching,the problem is pattern matching is one domain where even a little change in the problem statement means you have to spend a fuckton of time debugging a regex
Thanks
I need to read data when a button is clicked on my django app, that data is created with a python script from the users computer. If there is a better way to go about this then I am happy to reconfigure my approach.
I'm like you, I tried it and didn't like it. After that I just stick with os.path and it just makes sense to me. I doubt I'll ever switch to pathlib again. I do a lot of filesystem related tasks.
 def extract_some_data(data): match = pattern1.match(data) if match: return match.group(1) match = pattern2.match(data) if match: return match.group(2) return None
Replicate the functionality! Is that a joke? 
 phrase = "no u" print(phrase) FTFY
Added the link to the cheat sheet
Fair enough, I changed the post title. Thank you. As I didn't write it I didn't notice the difference.
How?
What is your script actually doing to read the data?
Probably not, unless the author has provided a WIP implementation. Usually the author of the PEP will provide it in the PEP if they have.
Lame, but thanks for the reply! It \*sounds\* like it's close to ready - I even saw a checklist of things that need to be fixed/done. Maybe my first opportunity to contribute to Python (though that is decidedly not in my scope of work ha!). Thanks again!
Are both of the computers on the same network? Can you just write to/read from a file on a network share?
Yes sometimes I'm use a bluetooth keyboard 
The full story or the code snippets?
If the user is using your web app, then you should think about how to send the data you need from user through the web app. You can create an HTTP API endpoint on your django web app (running on server, not on user pc) and use users python script not only to collect the data, but also HTTP POST request it to your django app.
Wish her very successful life ahead, 
If you're using python 3.6+ you could use format strings, instead of ".format". They're pretty cool. Basically you can put the variables right inside the brackets of the string
Creates a script that bulk downloads github repository. Just search for a term , set the limit of downloads Sit back and relax all the repositories will be downloaded 🙂

I wrote "20-minute written tutorial". Of course you can't do it by watching a video. Anyway, for people that have a lot of time to waste and will become shit programmers anyway, the kind of video tutorials that you're doing are fine.
there are two types of people: those who think regex is easy, and those who understand regex
Thanks, the script gets called from a get request at the moment though so Im not sure how to signal the POST from the django app with an API like this? Maybe I could just make a batch scipt that users could click on their desk tops but the ideal integration would be to not make them click outside of the app.
maybe you should try not being a dick
Ah, I see. Thanks!
Well that's quite true but I'd argue that a good chunk a regex users, if not the majority, wants to match patterns rather than parse regular language, in which case lookaheads come in handy.
Wow some are unbelievable. Here is someone who has done something to improve your understanding of regex. And instead of being grateful or at least be nice why be rude? If you don't want to learn then don't. If you feel it's long then just ignore.Yes even I agree that 17 part is slightly more but that doesn't mean it's worthless. 
Its pypi package for dymo scales that ive made some minor adjustments to. It connects to the usb device using libusb and returns a dictionary containing the scales readout which i parse.
What browsers are your users running? If your users are running Chrome, or a Chrome-based browser, you can access USB devices from JavaScript with WebUSB.
Yep, you can install `typing_extensions` and then do ``` from typing_extensions import Protocol class A(Protocol): ... ``` as mypy understands this. [This is an example](https://gitlab.com/pgjones/hypercorn/blob/master/hypercorn/typing.py#L7) I have written.
I think I could but how would I tell the computer when to write to the file?
They are all 20+ minutes? bless you for the effort, but that’s a lot of time 
 The latest build of the underlying logic that is used for destructible environments and planetary systems in my video games. The latest example of its recreational usage can be found at [GoshFather.com](https://goshfather.com/) The code was written in Python for the Open-Source Blender Game Engine. I am currently porting the logic to C# for use with the Unity engine. From there I should be able to produce physics based games with destructible environments for smartphones like Android and iOS.

Lol no. Most of them are 5-10 min. long. :p
Im familiar with this but last time I checked it wasnt recog izing my device. Will check again though.
&gt; Yeah everyone knows all of that,now try parsing any regex expression on the fly while you're debugging code and wondering why the regex matches things it's not supposed to. well, 17 part series ain't going to change that. Either you can read math or chemical formulas at a glance or you don't. There is no way around experience with a given DSL you have "pleasure" working with. People do overuse regexes, but that's not a fault of the concept of regex itself. 
you probably have the Vedas memorized too ;)
Needing a 17-part series about regular expressions says more about the viewer than regular expressions.
Holy crap, those diagrams are nice.
But what could you possibly fit into all that time?? Do you teach what a regular language is or some other compsci theory or maybe how it's working behind the scenes and how to optimise? I just can't fathom what would take 3 hours of video watching to learn in regular expressions?
Which group do people who can't regex their way out of the paper bag and think that regex is the invention of Satan himself belong to?
Wow, thank you! That worked and now I can use Protocol!! Much appreciated, this will save substantial rework down the road.
I love it, having come from .NET the thing I dearly miss and wish someone would implement in Pyhon is LINQ (Language Integrated Query). This is very similar, and short of it being built-in I'd welcome a well maintained library.
Not sure which "what's new" you're looking at, but the patch notes for 3.8.0a2 do have it: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380a2/
Sure, but given that Python has just adopted (in the interim, if we want to be totally letter-of-the-law about this) a steering committee, Guido *effectively* stepped down, even if temporarily.
Because of the _aggressively_ polarized feedback to PEP 0572 and how much of a PITA it was to deal with it, Guido decided to take a "permanent vacation" (thanks u/13steinj) from being BDFL. Since Python needs a governance model, they had a few PEPs to determine what to do next before [deciding to go forward with a steering committee](https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-8015-organization-of-the-python-community/193), which I believe is the same model NodeJS use 
Heh, good catch. My static checkers have made me weak.
Why not watch a few videos yourself and resolve that mystery yourself lol.
How would you start with something like that? Sounds really cool!!
I integrated your suggestions into the list, as well as a few more books I found, and [published it to GitHub](https://github.com/pamoroso/free-python-books).
