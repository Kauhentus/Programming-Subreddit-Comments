Was looking for this comment! Imo vector, matrix and tensor are the mathematical terms, whilst arrays, lists, dicts, etc are the implementations in certain programming languages...
DSP is digital. Circuit schematics usually mean analog electronics. You should find a DSP or electronics engineer to help you.
If you want to see a real project in action there’s an open source python implementation of alphago on GitHub. 
You cannot do that without help from your router; most routers will display the internet usage per internal IP. If yours does, either use that or if you want it in some other form parse the HTML of the web GUI, and if the routers doesn't have such a feature, you're SOL without buying a new router or at least a switch with that capability.
Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. I highly recommend posting your question there. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster.

I thought it was called tuple unpacking? The PEP calls it `iterable unpacking`, if that appeals to you more :)

I can hear the newer videos just fine. YouTube audio is really not a consistent thing, and I've needed to turn up the volume on some other videos too. If I'm the only one who has issues with them, I'll suggest leaving the other videos as they are.

Without the code that writes to the file it’s just a guess, but it seems that you overwrite the file each time you open it instead of appending to the file. Take a look at the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open)
I used "a" , appending the file

Alright , thanks for the heads up and tips ! 
Sure. I advise you develop more methodical approach for debugging: analyze points of failure, create hypothesis about what went wrong, write tests to cover the case and validate your hypothesis, fix. Repeat until success. Also, use logs with info that can help you debug more easily.
Point noted , I decided to be extra careful and put print "done" after a function has been done , so as to know whether the code went through :)
To me this question is better suited for a post in /r/learnpython 
You could just use the built-in logging module... But yeah, your pattern works. 
Yep, and all matrices are also tensors. Not all 2-d arrays are matrices but "2-d array" will always be correct. I feel like it doesn't make sense to use the tensor terminology, since we're often not really doing coordinate transformations on our arrays.
Anything that isn't already done would be great 😋
I think the secret behind many popular libraries such as requests, flask, wtforms etc. is that their authors design the libs APIs from the perspective of the library consumer. The internal structures of classes, functions, internal module structure etc. may be quite ugly and complex, but the API for the user of that library just feels so natural. I try to do the same when i am building packages for internal usage. I write dummy code with usage examples on how the classes etc. should be called until it feels "right" and "pythonic". Then i implement it that way.
Love this one. I was thinking of making something that's texts me with Twilio. May I ask how much they charge you for a single text, daily?
This was years ago, but in my undergaduate engineering courses, we were taught that arrays can be of any dimension, and that one says the dimension when using the term. 
Have you looked at `%debug` ? Gives and interactive pdb cell for the previous stack. 
Well I have a midterm on Thursday on everything in that email Im in first year college and have been very very behind. It's basically on the data structures; lists , arrays, stacks and functions I believe. I know the very basics however , I do have amazing notes and all the assignments solutions since he provides them. Anyway do you guys think it's possible for me to basically teach myself all this in about 4 days ? What do you guys recommend I do , I have alot of trouble on how to start and choose what to use for each code like for, while loops, etc...
That would seem to jive with the way numpy apparently uses it then. I suppose if you just think of it as arraying numbers/thingmajigs in some order, the exact nature of the ordering isn't implied in the term. 
Was just looking for something like this, thanks! Good write up!
I don't have the source code; this was from years ago. From memory, it was running a function against the Python objects in the array to transform them into different Python objects, short-circuiting if any of the transformations raised an exception. The transformation function varied depending on the type of object in the array.
Making a dead man switch that prompts me for a password every month. I have 3 attempts to enter it. After each failed attempt it sleeps for 24 hours. If the 3 entered passwords are wrong or no password is entered after 72 hours, it sends my wife an email with passwords, etc. Still trying to figure out the timeout after 72 hours part, though.
They could also be considered sets or tuples. This isn't very precise tbh.
Doesn't Python 3.7 introduce natively ordered sets (and mutable, ordered dicts)?
Make one with tensor
I stopped reading when saw the "**The Best Code in universe".**
Computers are not very good at handling lots of decimal places. You should not rely on too may decimal places.
I know, but im not expecting a long decimal im expecting a 1/2/3 decimal place number 
Firstly, I've got to wonder why? As other people have said you'd generally need support from your router to achieve what you want. Mine gives me no support for that, yours might. However, if you've got control of the router and a spare pc, you could set up a proxy that everyone's internet access has to go through. Block the router, give out the proxy Probably not going to be the most popular solution in your flat but you've given no context, so try that if it helps and you want a technical solution.
You can find someone on freelancer.com . There are some local people and some from other countries. 
Isn’t this for R?
Try writing 8.01 in binary.
&gt;lul. It is a reference to your code.
This [book](https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Concise-Effective-Programming/dp/1491946008). It contains recipes on how to write idiomatic python code. 
This is usually referred to as a tensor
IEEE 754 floating point is used to store the values, and binary operations are used for addition, subtraction, etc. 8.01 is `0b0100000000100000000001010001111010111000010100011110101110000101` -8 is `0b1100000000100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` Thus 8.01 + (-8) is `0b0011111110000100011110101110000101000111101011100001010000000000` Which can also be expressed as `9.999999999999787E-3`, or `0.009999999999999787` 
Thanks! Much appreciated :)
This unfortunately is common practice for me now. Forgetting to account for rounding has led to some weird bugs in my experience
Thanks the vars are coming from an URL, like this:?day=201808&amp;tp=income That tutorial might make me finally get a grip around f-string syntax. 
Python does have an array type and module in the standard library.
One note of caution. Allowing users to give you values that translate to raw SQL can open you up to an SQL injection attack. Instead of generating an SQL string, you should use parameterized queries. It works similar to an f string, where you have a placeholder in the string, but then you pass the variables after the string. Most databases and SQL libraries support this. 
Floats simply can't represent every possible decimal value. So you have to get into the habit of accounting for or correcting these errors if you want to use floats in any sort of logical comparison. If you don't absolutely need to use a float I would just use integers, otherwise use "round" as someone else mentioned
Think it’s like a couple cents per text. Quite cheap 
I'm pretty sure I did it that way because that was on the docs tutorial. is there any benefits?
You know you can just change the symbols for templating, in either django or vue?
My guess is false positive but that's with knowing almost nothing here. Let's go over the possibilities of a true positive however. It's almost impossible that Python source code has a trojan, so rule that out. You could have installed an unpopular module that has one. Also very unlikely. You could have an unrelated trojan that's just hiding in the Python directory, which strikes me as relatively more likely But in that case, try wiping out the install and installing again. Make sure you go to the real dot org site, and not like Source Forge or something, and see if that does it. Caveat: this is all total speculation in absence of better info.

This is less of a "Python knowledge" scope and more of a computer security scope. But I'll answer anyway-- Any file can be infected with a virus, any file in and of itself can be just a virus. All a virus is is a set of instructions (machine code or otherwise). What makes a virus malicious is that these instructions do bad things-- say, leak all your data to some bad third party. Or encrypt your data. Or modify the code of your browser to upon any page load inject spammy ads into the page. Or whatever. Keep in mind when I say instructions I don't necessarily mean machine code-- for example, MS Word 2003 "doc" (not docx) files were more or less memory dumps of the MS Word process, and an attacker would be able to artificially craft bad memory that could cause MS Word to do all kinds of crazy things upon opening. You can do this with docx in theory, but it's far harder and far less likely to do because it's xml based parsing rather than a memory dump. The file you specifically referenced was an LNK file, or Windows Shortcut. The normal program these are executed in is Windows Explorer (explorer.exe, the thing you use to see all your folders and documents and also manages your taskbar among other things). While I personally have never heard of someone crafting an lnk file to execute malicious code when opened, it is theoretically possible. It's also possible someone replaced the contents of that file completely with a windows executable and is just waiting for someone to execute it via a cmd prompt. Without seeing the contents of the file no one can say.

math pedants correcting people on the use of the word tensor is really annoying. Although maybe programmers should have picked another word to represent the concept of n-dimensional arrays to just skip all this confusion

It depends on what your code looks like, but if you don't specify a path before the file it should be in the current working directory of whatever called your code (usually the same directory as your code).
If it actually worked, OP wouldn't have posted it.
If you click on the link to the original article, you will see short descriptions of every entry.
It looks like your terminal settings are somewhat messed up.
I think i'll stick to playing on my lonesome. Thanks for the idea though, might get around it to it when I have more time :) Appreciate the help
Do you have a comparison to [PDFtk][1]? [1]: https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/
Tensorflow is the only reason i know what a tensor is lol
/u/Andrew_Shay It's archived.
Source code for Tutorial 1: import PySimpleGUI as sg # layout layout = [ [sg.Text('What is your name?')], [sg.InputText()], [sg.Button('Ok')]] # create the window window = sg.Window('Title of the window').Layout(layout) # read the window button, values = window.Read() sg.Popup('Hello {} welcome to PySimpleGUI'.format(values[0])) &amp;#x200B;
I'm using the terminal in atom IDE, so this probably it.
Source code for Tutorial 3 (window stays open): import PySimpleGUI as sg layout = [[sg.Text('Add 2 Numbers', font='Helvetica 15')], [sg.InputText(size=(8,1) ,key='in1'), sg.Text(' + '), sg.Input(size=(8,1), key='in2'),sg.Text('',key='answer')], [sg.Text('')], [sg.ReadButton('Add')]] window = sg.Window('Add 2 numbers').Layout(layout) # event loop while True: button, values = window.Read() if button is None: break num1 = int(values['in1']) num2 = int(values['in2']) answer = num1+num2 window.FindElement('answer').Update(answer)
You mean in the same document? Sure, as they don't collide.
Don't make it sleep.. instead i'd suggest you make it run often and check some config or data file to see what happens next. Not that I know how to do that, but it means that if your script crashes while asleep.. it wont' work, but in this case it has lots of time to recover. Pun intended.
Careful. That's only true if your field is R. But just because there is an isomorphism of vector spaces doesn't mean you should forget about the coordinate-free definition of a tensor. If you need to change your basis, then your transformation will depend on the order (p,q) of your tensor. https://youtu.be/4l-qzZOZt50?t=4218
Processes (unlike threads) do NOT share memory. So each has their own copy of variables.
Thanks! How can I get them to share memory then? Or am I looking at this problem in the wrong way?
Looks like I used [pygraphviz](https://pygraphviz.github.io/index.html) which is a wrapper around [graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/about/) which you will need to install for pygraphviz to work
What's with the gold in this post?
1. Use threads instead 2. Use some kind of Inter Process Communication (IPC) ex. shared memory: https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/multiprocessing.html#sharing-state-between-processes

If you created a feature to do a "true" crop on pdf files the world would beat a path to your door...
It is not a blog spam. He is my friend and he spend 2 days for that fucking post can’t you be less biased. He is 15 and loves python. Do constructive criticism but don’t be a dickhead
Basically more sophisticated traders entered the market. It had volume and was free money for most Also one thing everyone forgets is the commissions you have to pay the exchange which can explain modern day spreads
To be fair, price imbalances are generally bad and it's in the exchanges best interest to be roughly level so people don't shop around for better prices Most crypto exchanges aren't licensed. The ones with volume are all unlicensed
Are you touting that as a benefit, or a solution? I don't quite get how what you're describing is something that is necessarily made easier by the design choices you've made here, so I'm assuming your comment here is a work-around for the API you've given us. If it is the latter, why have you designed your application with an API that you expect to be worked around? I mean, you're Kenneth Reitz, if there's anyone who understands the importance of good API design it's you. I'm asking what your specific process was that made you choose an API involving mutable state, because I can't really see a good reason for it. I mean, I think there must be some good reasons for it, because I keep on seeing it. It's very popular in Node frameworks (see Express and Koa, which both have variations on this pattern). That said, I have consistently found in my experience that it tends to lead to messy code, to confusion as to what is being sent when, and to errors that take forever to track down because it's unclear where the original issue formed.
what you call a vector is not really a vector but 1D array, and the matrix is a 2D array, respectively. People who learned "linear algebra" through computing write funny things that would be invalid mathematical operations like adding a scalar to a vector, adding a vector to a matrix, doing matrix multiplication between vector and matrix. I mean, it's great that tools like NumPy allow that but it can kind of have implications for students to learn it this way if they don't have prior linear algebra knowledge and maybe put vector and matrix in quotation marks there
Though note that the Earth is not really spherical either, so this method will still be biased - just probably not by enough to matter. You could also ask if hill slopes should be more densely sampled than flat ground to preserve samples-per-surface-area... Ultimately it's a question of "uniformly sampled in what coordinate system?"
I believe that [Stuxnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet) utilized an LNK exploit. I also found [this article](https://threatpost.com/stuxnet-lnk-exploits-still-widely-circulated/125089/) from 2017 that mentions an increase in LNK exploits in the post-Stuxnet era.
You might want to consider contacting either the [Pypi maintainers](https://pypi.org/help/#accessibility) or the [pip people](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/). The Pypi page says there are mirrors; you might want to see if you can access those.
Nice app, thanks for posting it. What are the advantages of using asyncio for this instead of something like Celery?
You should post this to /r/learnpython. There are lots of issues here... you are trying to use a function (that doesn't return anything) as a class and you are trying to use a string as a class. The one thing you don't have is a class. If you did `print(type(userClass))` you will see it is a string.
&gt; To be fair, price imbalances are generally bad and it's in the exchanges best interest to be roughly level so people don't shop around for better prices Of course, I didn't say anything to the contrary &gt; Most crypto exchanges aren't licensed. The ones with volume are all unlicensed Maybe I'm misunderstanding your use of the word volume, but there are two with volumes that are indeed licensed.
you have 漢字, ひらがな, カタカナ, and 日本語 (kanji, hiragana, katakana, nihongo) all correct in romaji and English translation
in line 25, you are only writing the [0] index of the results of findall to the variable. try trashing the '[0]' to get all results. you might also review list.append. Im on mobile, so I cant cutpaste effectively. lo siento!
These reference sheets are not for learning. They are for reference.
&gt; you are trying to use a function (that doesn't return anything) as a class Works in javascript...
Isn't that what Google is for though? What's faster: - Locating a reference sheet on your harddrive and then scanning it for what you're looking for - Googling it (like everything else!)
I just finished a [Monty Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) simulator that can take any number of doors and tell you the benefit of switching to a new random door. Really fun beginner project. &amp;#x200B; With three doors, you have a 66.7% chance of winning if you switch, but I was surprised to learn that it quickly drops to 37.5% once you go to four doors.
**Monty Hall problem** The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal and named after its original host, Monty Hall. The problem was originally posed (and solved) in a letter by Steve Selvin to the American Statistician in 1975 (Selvin 1975a), (Selvin 1975b). It became famous as a question from a reader's letter quoted in Marilyn vos Savant's "Ask Marilyn" column in Parade magazine in 1990 (vos Savant 1990a): Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Just be carful! NumPy has both array and matrix structures. I personally never use the matrix ones and just opt for `array.dot()` for multiplication. 
First, /r/LearnPython is **way** more appropriate. But anyway, check the condition number of your matrix. And double check the equations. I use that often but don’t have it memorized and I am on my phone. Also, unless you *need* the inverse, it’s almost always better to use something like `no.linalg.solve` or `lstsq` (double check that. Again, from memory). Even when I do need an inverse, I’ll often do a chokesky and get it from there. It’s more stable and I can reuse that too. Finally, also check out the pseudo-inverse. See if that works. 
&gt; Works in javascript... Python functions can have attributes as well. But that's not how they are used in python. Try this: def inc_num(num): inc_num.new_num = num + 1 inc_num(41) print(f'inc_num.new_num={inc_num.new_num}')
This is probably more of a maths question, not Python specifically. But aren’t singular matrices in general pretty difficult to invert? I don’t think there exists a unique solution , so you should probably check your matrix to see why you have dependent dimensions, or look at other decomposition approaches such as the pseudoinverse.
Ditto. It's only useful for karma harvesting. I used to have a huge collection of *cheat sheets*, never even I found any one of them useful.
Thanks for checking my work
Why is there someone else's picture on my post? Sorry I'm such a spaz on Reddit...
/r/learnpython
Did you try rearranging it so that it makes more sense (i.e. with just one `isinstance()` check), or are you planning on `arg` to inherit from both `int` and `str`? Anyways, the whole `typing` project is seriously misguided, and this is just another illustration to it. It's also hard to tell which line do you call "second". Do you start counting with zero, or do you mean "second line with a comment"?
Exactly !!
I'm diving into python head first by trying to make a discord bot for my gaming community. It's awesome and scary at the same time.
No, it's not hard and I never took a CS course past high school. I've been writing python for the last 13 years. I just start writing. As I go, I refactor to make things easier to fit my use case. A general rule is if it doesn"t fit on one screen, it's probably too long. That and try not to make functions do too many things. Those two things not only make your code easier to read and more decoupled, but guides you into making useful methods for accessing the data.
Thank you, would you say I should learn flask specifically? I’m sure my question is so vague it’s hard to answer with out really knowing everything but is one easier than the others ? 
You'd have to build tests that would accurately detect the functionality breaking. If you are allowed to be building the API and there isn't a limit to the amount of hits you can do, you could try to have it guess at inputs until the test passed.
I might if I knew flask. Maybe django? They're probably both fine.
Tests would just detect the presence of the element right ? There is no way it could identify the fields without prior hard coding of its identifier ?
You can try making strong rules against minor design changes, but if site owner does complete redesign there's nothing really you can do. My personal tip is if site is using ajax for communication, re-create with network libraries(like requests) instead of browser automation.
It took me entirely way too long to work out that it wasn't HOWDOL
LOL.... that's too funny (and I'm really sorry if it took you a really long time)
Similar situations were reported in the past with AVG and Windows BitDefender. As long as you download from python.org and checksum is correct I think you are good to go. * https://bugs.python.org/issue30944 * https://bugs.python.org/issue33220 * https://github.com/python/pythondotorg/issues/1092 
You could loop through each one if a test fails until it reaches the correct pairing but short of that, yeah you'd have to manually make the change. At the very least, if you're testing you can quickly fix problems. 
In the general sense, this is an incredibly complicated problem, but in the specific case you're describing maybe the problem has a simple solution. For example, if you're really looking for id="tel" maybe you're just trying to find a telephone number. That's likely to match some pattern. Unless you have some more specific information about what you're doing I think the answer is "you can't."
There are a few different approaches. If you dont how to do the things your API has to do (for instance if need to connect to the Wordpress database) you should spend some time experimenting with code related to just doing those things. Dont worry about nice function wrappers, dont fret about having to write a bunch of boiler plate multiple times. Your goal is understand the moving parts under the hood first. Then you should take a "top down" approach. This means doing something like laying out all your API methods how they will be called/used. This needs to be legible and make sense for someone using your API. No one cares how sick that MySQL row generator expression if they have to call 8 poorly named functions with 8 different and lengthy argument signatures, which have no consistency between argument types.
Right. This is why it's not generally advisable to use web scraping for serious tasks—if you manage to reverse engineer the API and it's a *versioned* API which customers or 3rd party apps use, you might have something a bit more robust, but if it's an internal API you're in the same position.
Currently they do not have any public API. I tried reverse engineering it but without any success. Quoting my comment which I made earlier - &gt; Yes there is Ajax requests but I'm not able to replicate it. For example the site is www.paytm.com . Whenever I press login , I cannot see the username and password that's being sent to the server. There is a get request that's made but the username and password is not being sent. Either I'm too noon to get it or maybe they are doing something else there..that's why resorted to browser automation.
Check out the POST request to `https://accounts.paytm.com/oauth2/authorize` which sends a username and password. 
Only get requests are showing up in my console. 
Thanks :)
Ayo hook me up, I'm tryna learn python to get into Django :D

So to clarify youre writing an api that clicks the buttons on someones website for your customer using automation software? There is not going to be a way to future-proof that, and literally any change will break it.
This tutorial may help https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-xxiii-application-programming-interfaces-apis
Actually I'm not making it commercial and I don't have any customer per se. I just want to automatic few payments that I make at the end of the month. I know I can authorize my bank to do that but I want to learn API creation so thought why not ? Besides I was reading up on how the unofficial Instagram API was released much before the official one came by. So figured if I could make something similar to that for Paytm , it'll be useful. But rn, besides browser automation , I am not able to find any other way.
Love these! ggplot cheat sheet was a lifesaver for me.
Mods, please remove. Obvious spam.
Good job, I enjoyed watching your tutorials 
I get that with my IDE. It's 10 seconds. It's just hashing.

Is it possible you have the arguments to the dot product in reverse? To obtain a symmetric (and hence invertible) matrix, you'll want [`np.dot`](https://np.dot)`(X, X.T).` See the accepted answer [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/158219/is-a-matrix-multiplied-with-its-transpose-something-special) for more information. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Saw an job posting for a data manager, realized everything in the daily responsibilities listed were automatable. Applied for the job, arranged a service-level agreement for creating and applying my automation software, netted some nice monthly income. Saw multiple other oppurtunities within the business where Python would be able to wonders. Went from a starting salary of R8000 to R40,000 within 5 months ( as I gradually took over other peoples jobs) All in All, I’d say 4 people were fired because of my automation making them redundant. Sad for them. Happy for me. (R is ZAR, South African currency) (R40k is around 5 years dev experience/ senior dev salary in SA) (I just got out of uni)
There is a character on that line that is not in the UTF-8. Remove bad character. Also ensure you're saving as UTF-8.

While a funny idea that can't be accomplished as long as your brothers internet connection is encrypted (via https) which modern sites like Netflix usually require. And even if it was, you'd need to not run such a script on your computer but replace/modify the software running on your router :/
The documentation part of `odfpy` is very bad. I am trying to convert `*.pptx` / `*.odp` to displaying on the HTML (Jupyter) on the fly. Does anyone know how to do it?
I got replaced by a small shell script...
I automated Cisco IOS backups using Paramiko for SSH, and Pyinstaller to make it run on Windows without installing Python on them. I also made program to fill out tickets for various customers using pyautogui.

Your problem is the fact that the variable containers is a BeautifulSoup element that has a length of one. When you try to iterate over this variable it can only use index 0 (i.e. containers[0] works but containers[1] gives an list index out of range error). The for loop therefore only works on containers[0] and only prints out 1 record.
Well I would only call it half automation but I'm pretty proud of it considering I'm an automotive engineer instead of any sort of software engineer. For our mass production assemblies, each assembly gets a unique label sticker put on it telling us when and where it was made in our factory. For our pre-production event parts, 90% of the time we are requested to put these stickers on the event parts also. The problem is we usually dont have the full production machine available because it's still being designed and built. So for the longest time we were manually printing these stickers by sending a regular text file with the printer commands in it to the printer. Then we would manually increment the data (because no 2 stickers should be the same) and send it again. We would do this up to a thousand times if it was a big event. One day I just started messing around with the pyserial library and I printed a sticker so I thought of the idea to make a program to automatically print the stickers. I made a GUI to go along with it so even the non-technical people can use it. Just type in the number of stickers you want, some of the label information for that part, choose your COM port (we only have Windows computers so I havent dont anything to make it usable on anything else as it's just not needed for our purposes), and print away. It's saved us hours during these events. 
I had a tedious daily task of pinging all of the environment URLs to check that they were up by manually copy pasting from an Excel sheet so I wrapped it all into a python script that would ping them all one go from a list in a text file and tell me the http status code; 200 was good, anything else flag it up. &amp;#x200B; We also had a daily standup where it became a cuckoo's nest every time trying to decide who would update and in which order, so I put everyone's names in a random shuffle function chaired the meeting with. &amp;#x200B; Similar to my first task, we had a list of test customer data that sat in a dropdown menu on the landing page of our application - I wrote some scripts that used selenium webdriver to control the browser and hit all of the sad path customers as part of a set of regression tests ran every week. I was setting to work on the rest of the customer pack before I moved onto my new project where they also use selenium but with Java instead - boo!
figured this out, thanks anyway!
This is quite tricky. If you've got a standard home network, there's no way to add custom code to your router. You'd have to replace the OS in your router with a libre one. Then add a hook. Triggering based on DNS queries would be the easiest, since they're not encrypted. You'd have to have a list of MAC addresses which are his. (Or a list of all addresses which are not his) The hard part is getting a function to trigger based on web traffic. If you do manage that, it will probably slow down your web browsing significantly. So you'd want to use something like C, not Python.
That's a lot of cheatsheets, I don't even know where to start :P
Networking jobs are ripe for automation. Good stuff. 
Why "apart from DFA part" ?
Still looking for help with these: 中文 = Chinese 한국어 = Korean Ελληνικά = Greek кириллица = Cyrillic ไทย = Thai العربية = Arabic 
Sadly the intersection of people that truly understand networking and are skilled enough to write the automation necessary for it are small in number and high in demand.
That would work if Netflix wasn't using https. Injecting HTML/js into an encrypted connection is impossible :/
There’s a weird thing with network engineers; can be an expert of 10+ years of networking but a huge refusal to learn scripting language. I tell everyone I work with you can pick up a decent understanding of python in a week, and build more knowledge depending on what you want to do. And then it takes maybe 30 minutes to understand netmiko. I actually have a hard time finding those kind of jobs where I am at. 
I had a job which was shift work. We worked alone in a basement for 12 hours and we had to monitor stuff on a closed network. If something happened on this system we had to write a report that was formatted in a specific way (for computers to read). The report was released hourly. The solitary confinement was enough to motivate me to automate this job. In the end I turned 45 minutes of work into 5, eliminated typos, and turned the shift work into "send someone down for 5 minutes per hour". I was in a period which I would pay my dues with shift work for a year; I only did it for 2 months and had that deal eliminated for every new employee.
I don't have a job yet and I am a Python n00b, but I use Python to do nitty gritty pain in the ass stuff like wipe file(s). Zsh history *with how I have syntax highlighting it makes sense*, trash, uneeded sys logs *like old Rkhunter logs I don't need, etc*. It's like seconds of spared time, gotta start somewhere. 
I use a script to rename folders based on their project name. Not all scripts have to be complex.
i work at a print/mailing house. A lot of what we receive are PDF's from clients sftp - these are merged into groups depending on file name and made print ready i.e. adding blank pages on any even page PDFs for duplex printing. I have 3-4 scripts which just connect to these SFTP's, download the files, merge into groups depending on file name, adding any watermarks that are needed/blank pages, and create a spreadsheet at the end of the counts of each group type. One day I'm hoping to learn how to produce a 2d data matrix to put onto these PDFs. We currently use a slow piece of software. This data matrix is added for use with our intelligent enclosing machines. The barcode contains page n of m (1 of 1/1 of 2 etc..) and a pack number going up by 1 for each page. I'll get there soon.. I hope. I also have a few things for working with data files and matching on certain columns etc. Most of it is actually very simple and I learnt on the job. I wish I had the time to get better though.

Why ?
I'd say put up your scripts on github. The sheer fear of having to share your code will force you to improve your scripts in terms of software quality, and you will have a short portfolio to show when you look for python jobs.
I did not automate anything on my workplace ( i am a sap developer ). But at home. My python scripts are paying my car insurance automatically ( i get my bills via mail with a specific subject ). With python I control my complete smart home and anything which has to do with my personnel data. E. g. I come home -&gt; my phone connects via wifi to my raspberry pi -&gt; new pictures are getting saved and ordered without any manual step. Even pictures which look similar will be recognized and deleted. &amp;#x200B; This is something I really like. 
Thanks all I'll cross post to the other reddit.

Ethically, I think if your bosses are aware of your lack of experience with the python, and are stilling willing to pay what you're charging, then you're all good. If not, you could make them aware, maybe, with the added info that once you're through this project, you will very likely be able to accomplish future projects much faster because of your growth and experience. Assuming: - your project description is all there's to it - the website is not dynamically loading, and doesn't actively try to hide where the data comes from (hides/protects its API endpoints that is) it sounds like this entire project can be accomplished in around an hour given a decently experienced Pythonista, using libraries built for tasks like this (https://scrapy.org/doc/)
Good book
I feel like I see this thread every week
I work in finance, we use Excel extensively in my team and a few weeks ago we had to go over 500 excel files inside a folder tree of more than 100 nested folders and delete specific sheets which end with a specific text, each files has between 5-20 sheets.. I wrote a script to walk the folders and open xlsx files using openpyxl, delete the sheets that matched the criteria. Saved hours of going through hundreds of files manually
that seems dodgy, you should make sure to check the domain it comes from.
Evidently, a shell interpreter.
My Python automation story.. Using Apache Airflow. I highly recommend using this open source tool to build any kind of pipelines. Airflow is an orchestrator with web UI to track running jobs. Provides good monitoring. I jage used it along with Kubernetes for auto scaling and resilience. Works well for me.
I check a couple thousand results from an API for duplicates because they don't allow me database access...
You're right. It might be a good candidate for a sticky topic and merciless killing of the subject outside of that.
Very new to writing anything other than Hello World tutorials but I managed to create a script for my job that goes through a list of database entries and appends the text to a tiff image so the office ladies don't print out a digital document to SCAN IT BACK INTO THE COMPUTER! It was driving me crazy watching them do that, since Crystal Reports does't export tiffs directly I skipped it and went straight to the DB. Tried doing it in powershell first and while it worked I find working in python to be way more enjoyable. 
Tl;dr - Python helps even non-developer/office workers automate their menial tasks. Quick backstory: I'm not a developer by profession, studied business in university, but have been interested in programming for a few years (efforts have always been trivial). My current job is basically acting as a virtual assistant to enterprise salespeople. My disjointed efforts with Python paid off last week when I was asked to put together a spread sheet of account details for about ~500 companies. The info is already available from an internal website, so I wrote a script to search, scrape, and store the data for each account into a CSV file. Selenium + BeautifulSoup + Python's CSV module helped save me what otherwise would have been 6000+ rows of copy/pasting into Excel. Why a batch-like service isn't already provided, I don't know, but I was thankful for the opportunity to use Python in a meaningful business context - can't wait to do it again! 
Fair warning: I did something similar to my elder sister wayy back. It did not end well for me.
wow, that's epic!
I work in manufacturing too. If you're a tier 1 supplier, then you seem like a large manufacturer and maybe you work in a decent sized plant. I'm curious, do you use anything like an SAP or inforLN system? I've implemented manufacturing software at plants and that might be helpful to you because you could make labels and track WIPs throughout the plant. Just a thought. 
Like https://camelcamelcamel.com ?
Can you mock it with something like https://mimesis.readthedocs.io/ ?
Hey would love to get some more people using the tool. Could you clarify what you mean by true crop?
Could you add a link to the original post? 
I was working at a place that needed to upload people into a security system, and then assign them to a named group. It was being done by hand and took days (over a thousand people to upload), and then there was a second step where someone had to go into every file and assign a numbered ID card to them by hand in a task that was tedious and time consuming. I automated the two tasks, got a nice bonus check, and saved days of my life. 
Hey ccharles, I think the major differentiator with stapler is: \- simpler usage including easier to understand primitives with better naming. \- cleaner and simpler docs. \- modern testing setup. \- recently updated and tested, stapler's last commit was in 2016. I would love any feedback for features/changes that would help improve the tool, please let me know how we can improve pdfcli. I see there is an info feature in stapler that would be nice to have in pdfcli as well. &amp;#x200B;

Python does rock! Your project sounds interesting, are you looking at the data from an economics view point, or what's the end goal with tracking this data? Also, has your project introduced any cool libraries? 
Back when I was doing sysadmin things, $employer decided to move from symantec's Messagelabs product to Mimecast. We had a sizeable archive of messages in the Messagelabs forensic archive, and they wanted fat stacks to export and hand them over (something like 17k if memory serves). They also had a really crappy web interface where you could click in to each recipient/sender and export all the archived messages for that object to a pst file. Enter python and selenium...
Useful. Perhaps it would be ppossible to do this as a Django command? Um. Please do not encourage people to pass a remote url to a shell. Its bad practice and its not a good habit to get into.
There are some services that are trying to use AI to help update locators when tests fail, two I've seen advertise are: &amp;#x200B; [Test.ai](https://Test.ai) \- [http://test.ai/](http://test.ai/) Mabl - [https://www.mabl.com/](https://www.mabl.com/) &amp;#x200B; I'm not aware of an open source framework that is doing this right now. &amp;#x200B;
Sounds like you were covering your tracks 😅
I was thinking about making it something like Django app with command and maybe if I will have some free time - it will be there. Also, feel free to contribute ;)
Congratulations!
So i posted this yesterday but it is a perfect example of how python can help with the boring stuff at work. I'm a jack of all trades sysadmin mostly specializing in Linux. &gt; part of my job is data entry, filling out forms online with outside data. Recently, I made a script that opened a CSV file on my desktop that was filled with hard drive make, model, and serial numbers, and filled out an online form with the information in the CSV and some other unchanging values, such as name and department, and submit the form...times 200 or so
I also added a warning (don't really want to remove that command with wget, it's to handy))
I wrote a script to automate the dB at work that creates a backup snapshot of the dB That’s is why I love python 
I wrote a Flask app that does a bunch of things. Some automate, some don't: * Remote into people's PCs or view their C drive simply by selecting their name from a drop down. * Copy files from one server to another *and* fix the Windows permissions on them. * Format proprietary codes for system access. * A script that pulls all of the user's information from Active Directory, then puts it into an html file that creates a searchable employee webpage. * A script that checks for stale accounts in Active Directory. * A script that read the contents of an Excel spreadsheet and sent out an email with everyone's pin number from the spreadsheet (this one saved *a lot* of time). * A script that checks for locked out accounts. There's more. I just can't think of them at the moment. 
/u/IAmKindOfCreative Got an incorrect response here.
If you're curious about taking it to another level, check out Oxidized and RANCID. We use the former backed up to a local gitlab instance, works slick.
Sounds great. What could possibly go wrong 🧐
With my work, I had to create simple YAML config files for the software to read from and execute. I had to make anywhere from 10-15 of these pain-in-the-butt files per day, which after errors and everything could take me from 15-25 minutes per file. The script I made just auto formatted it as needed based some if-else statements and I was able to semi-automate it down to about 30 seconds per file
Not as fancy as a lot of you here, but I work in Marketing (digital advertising) and I'm a beginner at programming. In my role, there are 3 different type of keyword match types: \- Broad match: buy new computer \- Broad match modified: +buy +new +computer \- Exact match: \[buy new computer\] There are websites that convert one type to the other. However, with Python and Pyperclip module, I was able to do that very fast very easily. All I had to do was copy a bunch of keywords, double click on my module and it would get converted and copied back to clipboard.

Hey, thanks for your response. Awesome to find the right person on that topic. I do like the ideas behind envisage, providing extension points that can be extended by different plugins. This is basically what we need for our software project. At the same time, I just cannot wrap my head around how to implement something based on it. I think the power of the framework lies in its ability to abstract away many things. With this I am missing a bit of the explicit style I am used from Python code. What really stops my from basing the project on envisage is, that I do not trust my colleagues to learn those concepts required for the framework to provide its power. None of us is a real coder, most of what we do are dirty hacks. I would learn the framework, but I suppose the rest wouldn't. Thanks again for your response and the impressive project, that gave me inspiration on how I could tackle the project!
I'm changing careers to webdev, been trying to get solid at it since Feb (mid-life crisis lol) and recently started to look into freelancing. So getting an idea for what things are worth etc .. plus it's a mini project ha. Have it all setup and automated on my mac with a cron job that fires off at 11am via a bash file to curl/download the pages and trigger the python to do the heavy lifting and update my local .csv . All going well so far.
Did you dieded?
Which specific subject is that? ;-)
Why do you ignore Django Girls?
yeah.. I'm a ghost now. \^_\^
Congrats that is a great project. 
This is awesome. I have a lambda function that runs whenever a new codecommit repo is created that currently spins up an EC2 instance, clones a source repo and then commits it to the new repo, so every repo has a consistent skeleton, then the instance shuts down and terminates. I tried and failed to get git installed in a python function, and I will revisit that project now. Thank you!
FWIW, the equation OP put is **is** the (linear) least-squares solution to the problem assuming X is a Vandermonde (aka information) matrix. The `(X^T * X)-1 * X^T` is known as the pseudo-inverse
I needed to do something on a web page more than ten times, so I wrote an automation script with selenium. Rinse and repeat literally over a thousand times.

Not OP, but I was just thinking that. Well, I do *not* think it is reversed but I suspect OP may be doing multiply and not dot. OP: If you're using a later python version (I *think* 3.5 but I may be wrong), replace `*` with `@`. Otherwise, either use `np.dot` or: np.linalg.inv( X.T.dot(X) ).dot(X.T).dot(Y) 
It even has scrapy in the name! Haha I wonder why I never saw it in all of the eternal googling haha Thank you, I actually want to turn the whole thing into one script that allows us to scrape often to check for changes and all that fun, so, I'll look into it when I'm trying to clean it all up! 
I replaced a sys admin with a small shell script.
We use Canonical Landscape to schedule the patching and rebooting of our systems. I've written several python scripts using their API's that will automatically schedule systems to be patched based on tag name (i.e. Development, Staging, Production.) . Upon scheduling the systems, the scripts read the annotation information and email the system owner and business owner of the systems to be patched, the timing of the patching, and the number of patches to be applied. Once patching is complete, another python script looks for systems that were successfully patched and have the reboot required flag set. Systems that are found with this criteria are then scheduled to be rebooted at a designated time. Has cut down on the number of hours managing patches and prevent junior admins from patching/rebooting the wrong group of systems.
Any time a task can be described by a flowchart, it can be automated. Recently, I took a task that took 20 minutes and five programs (data processing) and condensed it into one automatic program. Now it takes 12 seconds. I just killed someone's job. Not sure how to feel about that.
If I understand your question right, you would use logical operators or boolean Operators or however they are called in Python, basically you would say "if 5&lt;4 or 8==8:" that would be true, There are also the "and" and "not" Statement, if you use "and" both conditions Need to be True and "not" inverts the condition so false becomes true and true false. You can use as many as you Need. Look it up on the Internet if it isn't clear.
Honestly I'm not sure how we track the data. We have an IT group and an ITS group that work together on the data tracking from beginning to end. I just work on the equipment so I just have to capture the data with our label scanners on then make it available for them to grab and do what they need to do. They usually tie it all together with other data like any forces or torques that might be used to assemble the parts. 
We developed a portal and had to register 50ish admin users who would then use the portal to register more members. Made the 50 people fill a google form and ran and script to register all of them using the csv abd requests packages. 
TLDR: visual shorthand to understand the orientation of city streets?
Needing to daily process a number of images from a security camera to an H.264. Using subprocess with pipes to spin up ffmpeg and reading JPEGs a binary files and shoving them in the pipe to ffmpeg to act like MJPEG stream. I've started to automate all kinds of ffmpeg with python. Going through a tree of files and see if they are H.264 encoded. If not, trans-code to H.264.
hey there! I wrote a simple unique ID generator: [https://github.com/fgebhart/uid\_generator](https://github.com/fgebhart/uid_generator) What do you guys think?
I have had the same thoughts, although order it think it would be worth it since order of assignment dependence would probably be poor design in the place, not the same as order of evaluation which would be preserved on the right side.
Essentially, yes. From the [blog post](https://geoffboeing.com/2018/07/comparing-city-street-orientations/) I wrote about it: &gt; Each of the cities above is represented by a polar histogram (aka rose diagram) depicting how its streets orient. Each bar’s direction represents the compass bearings of the streets (in that histogram bin) and its length represents the relative frequency of streets with those bearings.
Is that R40,000 annually? How much time did you spend on this per week?
http://getlektor.com
Yes - I had shared my code in \[this github repo\]([https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples/blob/master/notebooks/17-street-network-orientations.ipynb](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples/blob/master/notebooks/17-street-network-orientations.ipynb)) and a bunch of folks re-purposed it to visualize their own countries' major cities and share in various subs. It was really cool to see.
Thank you! The tutorial I watched he did this and it worked, so I'll give this a shot tonight thank you very much! 
It seems you do not trust too much static analysis tools. Can you tell me which are the reasons? False alarms or what? In addition to that, based on your comment, do you avoid to use static analysis tools preferring only dynamic tools (e.g., the ones computing test coverage)?
Oh, that makes sense. :D
BTW the gif will be updated later today. It now follows the function call to print vs the keyword for Python3

Thank you. Just bought it.
Congrats and great job! Now do New Orleans ;D
I hope you love it. That's the course I usually recommend. 
I can't believe how amazing and easy this would be. 
I don't believe so. This is my first python script (I work mostly with SQL) so I tried my best to follow along but got stumped. Here is his ss https://imgur.com/a/xpGwpLU
there is a massive dataset. i was just wondering if someone smarter and a better programmer than me has already done it. I mean the Madden video game, and other NFL video games always have some sort of algorithm to suggest the best/most common offensive plays. 
I did New Orleans in the research paper linked from my blog post.
Sentdex has a great free tutorial on YouTube, like 20 videos Kong’s, pretty well made
Nono, we save the secret info inside model.photo.jpg 😉
Awesome!
I'd love to see one for St. Paul, MN. I'd bet it's way different than Minneapolis.
Mypy detects ret\_val\_2 as being of type int. I'd recommend opening an issue on the pycharm bug tracker.
I'd love to see one for St. Paul, MN. I'd bet it's way different than Minneapolis.
Germany is not a city 
I used Python to delete all the automation scripts in place so I could bring back jobs for the American people.
I have since posting this, it seems like a pycharm issue indeed, thanks. How do I see what type mypy suggests for variables? I've written type annotations in the code but mypy doesn't comment regardless of whether I use int or Union[int, str] for ret_val_2.
Ah, that's exciting. I'm going to take a look when I get back home off of mobile.
Recently I posted this little example here on Reddit: [https://github.com/stribny/flask-api-quickstart](https://github.com/stribny/flask-api-quickstart). Originally, I wanted to add static typing and check it with mypy, but unfortunately I found challenges right from the beginning. I was surprised that only very simple examples worked and once I had annotated code in multiple files, I didn't get errors where I'd expect them. So it is not very advanced yet. And since annotating code is work, I decided not to implement it at that moment. Perhaps some other Pythonistas have similar experience and that's the reason why annotations/mypy is not used more. One point for mypy though is that it found a bug in the codebase (even without annotations), so there is potential. As for code formatting, I quite like tools like black, where the code is formatted automatically and you don't need any linter for this type of things. Generally speaking (outside Python) I had colleagues in the past who just didn't care for any such tooling (nor linting/static analysis/code style) and I had colleagues who cared about those things with passion. So for open source projects it perhaps depends on who is maintaining them :)
Lmao
Done! Thanks for the suggestion... rookie youtuber stuff. 
This is why everyone with a computer job might be better off to know some basics about scripts! Imagine how much time the world would save in repetitive manual computer tasks.
Sounds like you really know how to automate a life!
This is hilarious to me! Good job though. If a computer can do a job then a human shouldn’t be doing it b/c we’re just wasting that humans work.
I remember that post! Pretty cool.
I've heared of something called `Man-in-the-Middle-Attack`. Maybe i could just change the route he is going to. When he wants netflix, i will replace his request to a specific motivation video on youtube. It might not be the same thing i was thinking of in the beginning, but it would be a start. I'm not really familiar with C-Language. Writing an extension for the router firmware wouldn't be an option. Also writing a Plugin for my brothers browser wouldn't be the correct choice, because he know's how to disable the plugin :( I'm really thankful for all your replies and ideas!

You can find Seth Kadish's [original street-network histogram visualization post here](http://vizual-statistix.tumblr.com/post/80468941142/unlike-like-emperor-kuzco-i-was-actually-born) and a [really great follow-up from this technique's rediscovery by MapBox here](https://blog.mapbox.com/visualizing-street-orientations-on-an-interactive-map-1eefa6002afc) for anyone interested in learning the history of this technique.
Yeah, rhetorical and advertising questions mess the bot up. I don't currently have a spam classifier in place, so the bot just sees a question and thinks, "oh they're learning, let me help!", and doesn't think that maybe the post is a spammy ad Really I should just see if there's multiple udemy links in their recent post history. Less of a spam classifier, more of a if 'udemy' flag. But if statements work. 
Well.. Now I've got more time for playing video games,watch Netflix series or do other stuff. :) 
This guy skags
Different tasks, scraping websites for info, comparing gps coordinates for uniqueness, using fuzzywuzzy for name matching, cleaning database entries, reformatting from raw data to excel, access the db automatically, creating automated word reports. 
I use the Pycharm reformatting. No clue what they use for this. Pycharm static analysis tool which is based on mypy. Pycharm coverage which is based coverage.py. Why do I use the Pycharm stuff rather than the standard community stuff? Well... It's usually based on the community stuff, but it's all built in. Works painlessly and I really like the deep integrations they do. Everybody I work with also uses the same tools so now issues with consistency. Particularly with type hinting, it's only partially useful right now, but I'm adopting it across all my code bases because I expect it to increase in utility with time. It's definitely helped me catch a few issues and it's so useful for documentation. Type hinting is my favourite change in the Python documentation world (use sphinx-autodoc-typehints). 
Django official tutorial is great, MDN Django tutorial is also fantastic. If you absolutely need videos then the Sentdex course is pretty great. Coding entrepreneur has an absolutely incredible course but I wouldn't start with it but it covers so damn much. The most important part of learning anything with programming is learning to read the documentation. 
This is awful! Holy shit. Stackoverflow is littered with rubbish top voted answers. You also need the comments since answers may be out dated or less than optimal. The website is the right way about it. 
Thanks!
Beautiful! Congrats
based on your experience, are you saying that python developers are more willing to use static analysis tools because of the nature of this language?
have you considered about using static analysis tools for spotting bugs and/or vulnerabilities without executing the code?
https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners
FWIW, I think you're going about the task a little backwards. At least in my case, I got into contributing to projects by building things myself and then adding to or fixing stuff in libraries I was using. I feel like the motivation to do the work was stronger because I was fixing or adding things that I needed.
PyCharm's static analysis is not based on mypy - PyCharm is 2 years older than mypy and JetBrains strongly prefers to keep this kind of analysis functionality internal to the IDE. They generally only farm out debuggers (via forks of pydevd and delve for example) and generally interoperate with a slew of external tools but don't like to depend on any.
:D
You deserve it - that [post](https://geoffboeing.com/2018/07/comparing-city-street-orientations/) is maybe my favorite data/gis post of the year. 
Congratulations! Sincere question: did you put that `r/` there on purpose? If so, why?
At this time there isn't. I'll look into adding an option to block it, but you'll need to explicitly set that option when you create your window (like you do with no\_titlebar, stay\_on\_top, etc). Give me a little bit... check the announcements on the GitHub so you'll know when it's added / released. &amp;#x200B;

gotta have the output as tiff, first I was going to go from pdf to tiff but learning about interacting with databases directly with python has been a really cool experience. 
I used to do this, but with ARP "pings" instead. I was using scapy to do it. It worked really well. I just needed to know the MAC of the wifi radio and didn't have to bother with static IPs or reservations.

This is a odd use but it is a different way to think about: (if_test_is_false, if_test_is_true)[test] so: (7, 0)[6 == 5] Six is not equal to five so, 7 gets printed -- the true condition.

"Flat is better than nested."
We have a "What's everyone working on" sticky thread. Something along the lines of "What did you automate this week" might be useful, especially if people included source code to be consolidated into an "awesome automation" repository or something.
Fair enough, but its a core part of Django where you have class Meta nested in. Why?
I just wrote a Python For Data Analysis course at my college. I used this [Python for Everybody ](https://py4e.com) as the intro to programming and Python part. 
Mostly to just get rid of the inconvenience of printing multiple things while testing. There's one that I made for JS as well. Makes a world of difference
Have you used a debugger before?
In JS? Yeah I do everyday. Python on the other hand, I don’t 
What a happy cube.
I second that one. Also Introduction to Computation and Programming by Guttag is an option. Think Python is probably better since it's free and has problem sets.

Well, you've set yourself up quite an interesting challenge. If you really want to play, get good at Python, understand list comprehensions, generators, dictionaries. Learn Python RegExp. Then grab NLTK and all of it's resources, text corpusus, etc. Read the NLTK Book. Like twelve times. Do every exercize, expand beyond the exercises. At this point you will be able to do everything you have described, and also really painfully realize how limited you still are (as we all are so far) in this field. The more you learn about how language and understanding work, the greater you can see the task to actually be. There are a hundred ways to say the same thing, and two nearly identical utterances can have vastly divergent meanings. "Why is it that time flies like an arrow but fruit flies like an apple" is a question we can understand, recognizing the different meanings of flies and like in each part of the sentence, but getting a computer to do that is an amazingly daunting challenge. To fill in the gaps, then, we often wind up having to hard-code a lot of phrase chunks for crappy if-then routines, which we jazz up a little with random.choice elements in the Then sections, but it's still lame. The system still doesn't actually understand anything that's been said to it..... And as good as we can get, we're still decades away from genuine, fully conversational AI.
I'm in a Python course and we are using Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science So far, it is really good and pretty cheap for a textbook. 
Actually a very good resource. Especially after a week of banging your head against a wall trying to find a clean, bulletproof, pythonic way to get your system to respond to what seems like a simple utterance without using 50 if-then lines.... :)

I work for a healthcare company. I found out that a department was manually checking to make sure that the correct providers and facilities showed correctly for each of the (now 40+) health care plans we supported. I wrote a python script using selenium that goes to each page needed(including subcategories for most) for each of the plans and tests for the presence or absence of different links and buttons. After getting it working I found out that my script (which takes less than 5 minutes and performs 4000+ tests) kept that department from having to do 70+ hours of manual checking.
I remember this going around and this was one of the posts that stuck with me. Fantastic job!

Oh sorry, that is poorly written. There's a crappy job in the basement, it's an engineering space basically. It's all networked and you don't need to walk around but it's just you...alone...for 12 hours getting measurements, doing math, and writing reports that are specially formatted to be read by a machine. New employees (and some poor souls who never left) would have to start with this job. The deal was, "do a year of this job so you know what's going on and then we'll move you to a better job". I automated the entire process so no one had to work in the basement anymore. Not anyone. Never again.
Great work!
Would you believe I didn't get hired as a programmer but after that I've been doing it for about 5 years now?
There is one called Grokking Algorithms, which teaches basic algorithms such as binary search, dynamic programming, etc... And basic data structures such as trees and etc using python. Of course "basic" here meaning "undergraduate level" basic. For anyone without a CS degree this book should be a mind blower. 
That's cool, but just know this doenst have much to do with the hyper-cube or 'tesseract'.

https://github.com/manatlan/wuy It's done for that. It lets you make an HTML UI, and embbed it your exe, reusing the local chrome. It's light, and powerful, and your users won't see the difference with a real UI toolkit
That's fine then and a great learning exercise. Just keep in mind that as soon as anything changes at all ever, it's gonna break. An API provides an access point and a standardized way to make requests. A UI provides an access point that's designed to provide a good experience for a person. The former relies on normal program abstractions, the latter no so much.
I’ve just noticed a growing trend of people doing that. Trying to research the origins, if I can. Been here 7+ years, and it’s not something I’ve seen before about a month ago. 
If you're using an IDE, maybe it has something to do.with python versions? Try printing them out in the terminal and in a script. Also, if the timing doesn't need to be too precise a loop with `sleep(28)` and your function might be enough.
Looking at the latest commits in the Tauthon project, it seem to me that it have all but ground to a stop. As I recall, there was a quite a lot of interest and support last year when the project forked. But activity decay have set in mighty fast. So what's the deal? Will interest rise as the python clock count toward zero? 
Thank you!
My homework for Learning python the hard way. I Still have 5 more days left to work on it so I will be updating.
What version of python are you running? Exactly what did you do to install the module? If running every 60 seconds is acceptable, use [cron](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/cron.md) which is built in.
3.7 something, via terminal pip install schedule Installation went fine
Do I have to: import time timer.sleep(28) ???
No just use Cron especially if they are simple and maintainable and you are the only one managing it. Airflow is better for numerous robust pipelines that need extra monitoring
It should be (sorry 4 being too dumb for proper code highlighting): `import time` `while True:` ` time.sleep(28)` ` your_function()` This will your your function every 28s + however long that function takes
aww,so cute

If you actually did `$ pip install schedule` then it's possible you installed for python2. Test this by running python2 in the terminal and doing `import schedule`. If that works you installed for python2. Do `$ pip3 install schedule`.
They dont care about it. The sticker labels have to get on the parts one way or another. They dont care if we take 30 minutes or 3 hours to print the stickers.

This week I'm halfway into a six-week project at school. We've been asked to create a real or fictive project of our liking, and I've chosen to create a Python program, together with a Debian live env, that will allow for to computers to boot up, find each other on the network and then transfer user folders between them (Windows/NTFS) automatically. In my case it's for a fictive business who wants to do computer setups and transfers for their customers faster and easier. Nothing special, but it has really taught me a lot about Python so far, and I am looking forward to the next three weeks as well.

Boston is a smaller area though whereas Atlanta's cow path streets are out of the core. I'm not trying to say this is inaccurate, more of an interesting aspect of data boundaries and definitions.

Given that you have the shapefile of the country you could create a grid using geohashes. There you can specify how granular the grid is. Once you have the grid, you could pick random points from the tiles of this grid. To get an idea of this, check out: [https://blog.tafkas.net/2018/09/28/creating-a-grid-based-on-geohashes/](https://blog.tafkas.net/2018/09/28/creating-a-grid-based-on-geohashes/) 
That is a great idea with a couple of considerations. Actually, I'm writing this library in case anybody (including me) might want to write an application for any desktop environment in Linux except Gnome and KDE (these can easily connect) to integrate their Android devices with their desktops. I think what you are suggesting is an application behavior rather than a library behavior since this kind of operation will surely block and brick the current thread a lot. However, this can be implemented in library with a function so that any application built-on this library might use this function with async in mind. Thanks for suggestion. :)
A simple timeout should do the job. You could also launch a process / thread that automatically handles disconnects. (And keeps the requests in a queue)
No, not at all. I don't have data for that. &amp;#x200B;
&gt; I think what you are suggesting is an application behavior rather than a library behavior since this kind of operation will surely block and brick the current thread a lot Well, that depends on your definition of library 😁 For example, zeromq automatically handles disconnects and whatnot, but still retains its non-blocking behaviour, with the aid of a seperate thread.
Actually, you are right about that case. 😁
AFAIK, there are no other git.io clients written in Python, so I made this. It can shorten any github.com or github.io domain URL to a git.io link. You can also customize the shortened URL with a custom string to get `git.io/&lt;yourCustomText&gt;`, if it hasn't already been taken.

Reminds me of my attempt at a basic 3D animation library, which I named PyShapes. I never ended up translating my math to numpy, so the code is a bit obnoxious at times, but here it is: [shapes.py](https://github.com/SerpentChris/PyShapes/blob/master/shapes.py) The repository is full of old and unfinished code but that little demo is kind of neat imo.

Spent 30minutes a week logging my work-hours on project and customers. First browsing bugzilla to find what I had worked on, then estimate hours, then create project tags in the web-application we used called IFS and attached my hours to it. Found something new called selenium. The perl interface was rather buggy, while the python interface was smooth running (this was 2009 on very early version of webdriver). It was my first venture into both python and selenium. 
That is one very good reason to use Python. Take a look at pandas specifically. It creates table-style data similar to Excel spreadsheets in many ways (but not identical). 
Thanks, I'll do a little research in this API. :D Generally, I need a data about a land and terrain near to cellular network's transmitters. I need it for a project to my college. I am aware that some of transmitters are really far away from any man's land, so it would be awsome if it can give me even a basic knowledge about a land near a transmitter. 
Combination of Python and SQL daily and it's fantastically useful. Python is flexible enough to be a tool in any analysts workflow, but how you use it can differ greatly based on what you're actually tasked with. I still use Excel to quickly pivot/share data once I've pared down a data set, but that is mostly because others in my group ONLY use Excel, so a common format is required.
Our shop mostly works in SAS EG, but I started working with Python last year to handle a projection project which needed the results to be accessible to stakeholders. I ended up building a web-based tool which displayed the results with chart.js served through django. Though most folks would probably look at my code in horror, it did the job and it's stable. Since then I've been working on automation of datasets and more data-sciency projects. The packages are all quite mature now and more and more people are moving to Python for data science. I think it would absolutely be an asset to you. Let me know if you have any specific questions. I'll try and answer what I can.
I'm busy scheming [cutelog](https://github.com/busimus/cutelog) into our workflow at work. Currently my colleagues are using the debug-print antipattern, which makes for horrible tool use. 
Take for example the sin function in numpy. Import it as `from numpy import sin` or any other way that you can think of. The check will despite numpy being installed because numpy does some black magic when you import the module, so it does exist at runtime. So, if my code runs, those errors are wrong. If it doesn't maybe I typo'd. You can ignore the import, but maybe I thought sin should actually be spelled sine (it is), so it's an actual error. If I use the the style `np.sin` in my code, I could have 50+ import errors (many of them repeated). It seems like pylint should know numpy does that with their imports or define a syntax to say these are created at runtime.
While I like the animation, this code isn't written for sharing. Some quick points: * As /u/Sosewuta points out, you're variable names are obscure, or lazy * You define constants amid function declarations * You don't take user input, so anything that needs to be edited (`Sname`) by a new user should be defined right at the top (with your constant declarations) * Same with comments about dependencies -- put that in a docstring at the top not as the literal last line. * Your functions all have zero explanation, and when combined with your variable names, the whole thing is pretty opaque (This is especially true for `init()`) * PEP8, etc

Basically you're asking when does the computation involved with importing a module happen https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3095071/in-python-what-happens-when-you-import-inside-of-a-function
Every time you call input it takes the code from that module and drops it in place of the import statement so the interpreter reads it as one long file. So yeah it happens when you call import. Hence you have to import before use because python is interpreted not compiled.

Oh yes, definitely! I find it easier to pivots in Excel because in my case, it's typically used for exploration and/or sharing. Since the output format will almost always be Excel so others can use it the data themselves, it's just a more convenient method. I make **heavy** use of `pd.to_csv` and `pd.to_sql` - to a lesser extent `pd.to_excel` because I'm lazy with the formatting, which makes it equivalent to its csv counterpart. But there's some [really cool stuff you can do with `pd.ExcelWriter`](https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/working_with_pandas.html)!

Indeed sometimes you want to do everything using primitives to demonstrate they've understood the logic you are trying to teach them. When I was in my first year at university, we had one lecturer who made us code almost everything ourselves. Even banned us from using more complex syntax for loops, until we knew how they all derived from while loops, and not before we'd understood how while loops were implemented, etc.
The code in a module is executed once when you import it. That's why you sometimes see this code inside a module: if __name__ == '__main__': # some code That ensures that `# some code` is **not** executed when the module is imported. Importing the same module twice or more times does nothing after the first import.

Can’t help you getting the file back. But this is the time you should start using backups and a SCM tool. Git is popular. To make sure you don’t have this issue ever again. 
None of these work currently with my application, and I think I’ve traced it to a problem with trying to use pandas. Am I alone here? I designed a GUI with pyqt5 and can’t get it to push to an EXE with any of these.

First, this happens to virtually everyone at least once and *it sucks*! Sorry it happened to you, but don't feel bad. You're not alone :) Did you run the file before?

Python is fantastic and definitely be an upgrade from Excel. There will be some adjustments to be made, but overall you will definitely be provided with a plethora of libraries that will be super useful. The trade-off obviously will not having the What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get editor like in Excel where you can see everything. With Python you will be able to consolidate and aggregate a larger amount of data much easier and efficiently once you get used to it. It will also provide a better learning foundation into other types of data formats like CSV, HDFS, databases and algorithms or workflows to manipulate and make sense of data. Definitely on the right track and hope you enjoy your journey!

The .pyc file is created alongside where ever you saved your file. So if your file was named "foo.py" then the pyc file would be "foo.pyc".
I agree that the easiest way to learn will be to jump into solving "close" to real or real problems, but always remember that the academic/structured learning materials such as documentations are always important. You can find many datasets here: https://www.kdnuggets.com/datasets/index.html Start with learning how to load them, understanding relationships, and how to constantly improve on how you write good code. I remember all to well the excitement that ran into me when I finally was able to load data into a pandas DataFrame and do aggregations. You can also explore the csv module from Python and learn more bout the data structures within Python itself.
I hope it isn't. I mean, no offense to the creator, but that thing was at best a distraction.
Thanks for mentioning pycache. I forgot about that change.
Working on a dynamic text parser that tries to estimate and qualify delimiters and a machine learning model that allows users to correct it and improve the algorithm. Working with tons of unstructured data encouraged me to build a solution.
What operating system do you use on your work PC?
Yes, you literally download the installer from python.org and select the installation folder you want. This folder may very well be on a USB drive. You can also install PyCharm on your drive - and now you have a fully featured portable development environment. I’ve been using this exact setup (Python from python.org and PyCharm) on my USB for some months now, and it works like _charm_ :D

I'm a Jr Data Analyst at my company, a position created for me after I built scripts in Python to automatically create reports and do analysis formerly done in Excel. I rely heavily on pandas, with it's CSV functions and indexing and slicing I can automate or semi automate pretty much anything they do manually in Excel now. I used to use Excel but it's so slow for massive data and often crashes. The difficulty starting use python is not being able to visualize what's happening, but the more you do it the easier it becomes and then you'll wonder why you ever did these things in excel haha.
"aa".join([c for c in "The fox"]) I think thats the easiest and fastest answer
wait that will not serve "".join(c + "aa" for c in "The fox") will do fine
Create two functions.
Using pandas has become the most common way for data analysis at my workplace (by software engineers and some product managers). That and Numpy allow you to do pretty much all data transformations you can think of. Visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn are very useful as well. Finally, Jupyter notebooks have made it easy to share your analysis which allows others to easily rerun all your analysis steps and tweak them if they want to. 
So is Brainfuck lmao
I have finally finished refactoring my IRC bot system. I now have a robust plug-in system, TUI and GUI management interfaces. It was a lot of work, but I think it was worth it.
It’s extremely useful. One of the most salient non technical things I’ve found working in various organizations, especially those where these skills aren’t prevalent is that coding is almost self documenting. I’ve seen countless business practices where you get an extract from a system and someone may fiddle around in Excel to change some features here or there and never document it. That person invariably leaves and creates a gap for future members. With Python or other programming languages the mere act of coding creates an evidence chain. Aside from all those mentioned I’d say if you frequently have consumers of data who only use Excel and limited IT infrastructure, think about how you might use Pandas as an output to a preformatted workbook to synthesize your analysis. The result may be less fancy than building a Bokeh dashboard but getting your results to decision makers in an impactful way is is the most important thing. 
I also need response status code, accesible only from a response object (not body text ou binary body)
Definitely less than half a minute. It’s a very simple installation, tho: it doesn’t have many 3rd party packages installed (like numpy, matplotlib, etc). They may take a long time to load. 
The example doesn't have "aa" after the white space.
If you want something like Anaconda take a look at this: https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/ It is designed to be completely portable and has the most common libraries and tools built-in like Anaconda. It comes with IDLE, Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, etc... and took up about 2.5GB when I last installed it. 
Anything created by /u/sentdex is worth an upvote. If anyone is ever interested in learning concepts with Python. Always start on his videos.
Uppercase constants are PEP-8
Strings are iterable so this works too: "aa".join(list("The Fox")) + “aa” 
Look at his NAME, I think he might be in on it. 
\&gt;&gt;&gt; import re \&gt;&gt;&gt; re.sub(r"(\\w|\\w )", r"\\1aa", "The fox") 'Taahaaeaa faaoaaxaa' &amp;#x200B; Boom, now you have two problems!
yeah but I dont like to have to add the extra + "aa" so I replied to my coment with an updated way
I'm a quantitative researcher - if you want to stay in financial mathematics, I would suggest just trying to do all of your analysis in python (try to not use excel when don't have to). R and by extension RStudio (great tool) are more heavily aimed at statistics and are great tools that I use when iterating on my models. Although most of my experience is in Python, I do find myself just going back to python when I can get away with it (rather than using R). Run away from MatLab if you can. In terms of what statistics you should look at: you should understand things like mean, median, mode (sounds basic, but you should know when and where to use them), standard deviation. Understanding the covariance function, and by extension how correlation works. More advanced topics can include linear regression models (I've not really used any clustering models in finance yet - doesn't mean there isn't a use case though.), multiple linear regression models, moving averages, time-series analysis (ARMA, ARIMA). A great book to read is Elements of Statistical Learning, it's quite dense for someone who isn't mathematically inclined, so I'd suggestion the precursor book to it Introduction to Statistical Learning, same authors.
I think /u/pep8-thyself going for [this sentiment](https://twitter.com/raymondh/status/486247110870695936?lang=en); that is, don't needlessly harass others about PEP-8 compliance. I agree being persnickety about PEP-8 compliance is silly, but being needlessly intolerant of people pointing out gross PEP-8 noncompliance is well, being persnickety about being persnickety. 
Also joining a list is better and faster than joining a generator.
well then you put some square brackets there asking for myself, why is that? it is only better for performance or are there more reasons?
So is Age of Empires map editor
Oh that doesnt really matter, in the post I forgot that [space] was also a character but that doesnt really matter
There needs to be an extra processing step to deal with the space. def appender(string, suffix): if string.isalpha(): return string + suffix else: return string &gt;&gt;&gt; "".join(appender(c, "aa") for c in "The fox") 'Taahaaeaa faaoaaxaa'
Not quite true, MatLab will drain your soul of all emotion until you're a hollow shell of the (wo)man you used to be.
Isn't there a library for that?
Source ? 
Worked as a data analyst during my internship last autumn. A combination of xlsxwriter, numpy, pandas and scikit-learn really helped me solve a lot of complex tasks - plus xlsxwriter was super good so you could integrate VBA/Excel workflows into your python scripts.
Just got assigned a cool project to use python to RDP inti two other windows machines and trigger a shutdown, and send me a notification that it did that succesdfully or not. Never knew anything about python until today, super fun so far!

I've been doing data analysis for decades and have pretty much 100% switched over to python. Using python is usually much more sensible than Excel since python code can be rigorously verified as opposed to Excel [https://www.businessinsider.com/excel-partly-to-blame-for-trading-loss-2013-2](https://www.businessinsider.com/excel-partly-to-blame-for-trading-loss-2013-2) Also Python is largely platform independent and can be readily modified to adapt to new data set formats. I recommend Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists By Andreas C. Müller, Sarah Guido It provides a very good overview of common packages including numpy, scipy, pandas, and seaborn. 
What library did you use for the animation?
:P please do it again and up the frame rate. That hurts.
yeah i have it at 100 but the code is built to handle any framerate. i was worried it would get too unwieldy.

You can remove those `continue` statements at the bottom of your for-loops. `continue` moves execution to the end of the loop, so having them there is redundant. Thanks for sharing

welcome to epicyclic, Joseph Fourier awaits you
Unfortunately I have no experience in banking, I work for a small company in the healthcare field. I have no experience with R, we don't use it here. As for Python and SQL, Python: those libraries I mentioned before. Pandas and numpy being the most used. Being able to sculpt your data in dataframes using apply, lambda, and list comprehension are important foundations. SQL: being able to make basic and intermediate queries to pull your data in. Nothing fancy and no real DBA tasks should be required, but it never hurts to learn some simple DBA tasks. That's mostly for a Data Analyst. Data Scientist is a bit different, all of the python from above as well as machine learning and how to create models, for training and testing. Not as much SQL, you can stick to basic queries for the most part. A lot of times I'm helping the Data Scientists with harder SQL queries and doing preliminary exploratory data analysis for them.
&gt; Often Iterators and Generator are using (sic) interchangeably. For a narrow person this can be true — when you use them, it looks like they work the same way: you can loop over, _slice it_ or get an element. You can’t slice a generator, that is, you can’t do `(x for x in range(6))[1:3]` or something like that. Yes, there’s `itertools.islice`, but that isn’t really slicing. You also can’t get _an_ element of a generator: you can only get _the_ next element, if it exists.
Hey in still a huge newbie, so forgive me, but what does the "-m" mean?
"And make it in a week for $100" - 8/10 clients 
it's self explanatory #rimshot ps: serious explanation, methods are function with an extra first arg named self so they can read/write the object they're applied to, nothing more; python probably did this as a convenience, in Java for instance (NPI) this can be ommited and variables will be resolved using the locals and the object instance by default; you'd only need `this` (equivalent of python self) if a local variable has the same name as an object field in which case it's used to remove the ambiguity. cheers
do you know any good books on epicycles?
Thank you!
Yeah, the gimp interface is lacking. I'll look into this.

doing it now
I mainly use Python for data cleaning/formatting, SQL for basic data pulls/counts, and SAS for modeling and inferential statistics. you can do all of this in Python but it's more of a pain to code - SAS will immediately give you your ROC plot, your betas, etc with a proc logistics for example, but you've gotta do a good deal of coding to get the same out of Python. that said, if you want to do any really specific in depth customization, you're much better off using Python (you're not likely to run into these situations if you're just starting out as an analyst though).
You should look at the overpass API 
Wow. You're popular having so many requests. Frame rate needs to be divisible by monitor fps to be smooth. Monitors tend to be at 60fps, so 30, 60, or 120 (or 240) are all acceptable to get it to look smooth. 25 looks like an old timey movie, where the frame rate is off but you can't quite place how. This is because movies run at 24fps.
Hi, thank you so much for that response. That was what I was looking for. :) Have a nice evening!
there is no "-m" for pip (or pup :P ) but there is for python itself. It is used to run a specific module. so for instance python3 -m unittest runs the unit testing framework, which automically looks for tests in the current directory. from the help text : &gt;-m mod : run library module as a script (terminates option list)
yay :3
Trying to get a local python server set up with breakpoint support on a VS Code project using an `attach` configuration. I'm slowly becoming convinced it's not possible without physically coding in the breakpoints I want to look at using ptvsd or pdb. Can anyone prove me wrong?
that's one topic I know no books about, ask quora or r/maths :)
sure thing.
How long have you been doing Python and/or programming? 
`self` is just a name of the the first formal argument of a class’s method. This actual first argument of the method is the instance of the class the method belongs to. It’s used to let the method use the attributes and methods of said instance. The name `self` is not mandatory as it’s just another variable, so you can call it the way you like; however, calling it `self` is a popular convention.
It certainly helps a lot to have a PhD or at least a Masters. But it depends on where you want to work and what kind of Data Science you want to do.
self is there to differentiate between instance variables and non-instance variables. This is pretty much mandatory for object oriented programming. If an object can't tell the difference between its variables and everything else's then the whole concept of object oriented programming and abstraction would be pointless. Life without the self marker, is life without object oriented programming. Think about making a game without classes like back in ye olden days. `player_name = 'Mark` `player_pos = (30, 30)` `player_lvl = 0` `player_items = ['sword', 'magic hat']` `items_in_game = ['sword', 'wand', 'shield', 'magic hat']` `for item in player_items:` `player_use_item(item)` &amp;#x200B; Because there's no abstraction or classes due to the inability of differentiating between object and every other variable, we're forced to create our game this way. Whereas if we had our self operators and with it, abstraction, things can become a little less garbled. `class Player:` `def __init__(self, name, pos, lvl, items):` `...` &amp;#x200B; `player = Player("Mark", (30, 30), 0, [Item("Sword"), Item("Magic Hat")])` `for item in player.items:` `player.use_item(item)`

I like it. Now play with Processing to do the same.
Shit, the program runs for about 30,000 cycles, then becomes too memory bloated and seg faults the runtime environment.
You have a point. Mine was about functions like `range`, which is a generator, but you can loop over, slice it and get an element. Fancy stuff is hidden, so `range` behaves and looks like a itarator and generator, it is easy to mix them up.

Eli?
What you are calling a generator in examples like `SomeGenerator` is not a generator. A generator is the iterable produced by calling a generator function, but `SomeGenerator` is just an iterable type that happens to use a generator to define `__iter__`. Generators are a specific type of iterator formed by generator functions where the iteration state is basically a stack frame. Iterators are a specific type of iterable where `__iter__` returns self. 
Thank you
I'm learning class and python. I think comments would make it really helpful for me to read your code :(

Pandas is known to cause issues (from my experience).

Unfortunately, especially with a purely digital market aligned with a digital currency, the markets are incredibly efficient. The price discrepancies you are seeing are because of various risk factors. You have to account for the actual fiat liquidity the exchange has, time for you to actually withdraw, shuffling your money around the globe, and the fact the exchange could vanish overnight. There are extreme reasons these price fluctuations are there and I discourage anyone from trying to exploit this to make money. You will lose your money, period.

If you are planning on using ESRI’s ArcPy, you can use esri’s modeling tool to build a model and then export the model to python. It doesn’t always create the best code, but it will work.

I am Working on sentiment analysis on Twitter social network. Currently I have built a script (mostly with the help on stack overflow) to filter the tweets and save it in a file. I am looking at logging feature to create a rotating log (of filtered tweets) this week.
OP likely started his code, with z being a parameter, instead of a constant. Maybe it was a list of colours (or enums). You're advice is sound, but assumes all the code was written in one sitting. This is a friendly reminder, that the dev we were 6 months ago, is not the devs we are today. Our constraints, requirements, understanding and skills have likely all changed.
in 2.7 maybe not.

I initially thought this language would prove to be useless when I was learning it but it has been extremely useful (because every company has data!). &amp;#x200B; I use Python but only once every few weeks. I mainly use it to format data into something usable (such as parsing through nested JSON), clean data, or perform cross database joins. I don't use it that often but it definitely is the skill to learn if you want to be a data scientist. It opens up options for me when solving problems that I cannot perform in SQL or Excel.

A django app to present stock data. Btw, How do you create an interactive chart with slliders and zoom? I'm not there yet, still learning how to structure the project but I remember using d3.js many years ago. I am following corey schafer's blog creation using django right now.
Hmmm, the Earth is flat.

That is awesome, thanks! Feel free to ping me if you get stuck on anything, I'm more active than I should be on here. 
Type Where python At the command prompt and make sure the correct python is being run.
I actually don't know shit about Python or even physics, but I'm very interested on all kinds of articles and tutorials, and yours seem pretty good. I very much appreciate your availability to answer any questions I might have, though. Maybe someday I'll actually learn to code (and also how to do proper math/physics) and use your tutorial to learn something new. I mean, that's why I saved your comment, so expect my DMs, hahah! Thanks again!
I think d3 is still a pretty good choice for interactive plots. Bokeh is another option.
Learning python and tensorflow. (machine learning, ai, deep learning etc.) Difficult stuff but I'm determined to learn it!

Okay I just started learning python and I'm like 75% through [this](https://www.youtube.com/watchv=rfscVS0vtbw&amp;list=PLPGGbChYDHrkWSpw8U0G-yRxlJT9Iums3&amp;t=0s&amp;index=3) video,but how can you make a moving object like this using python? o.0 
I've never had any problems with auto-indenting Jinja2 templates in PyCharm. But, I use `.html` as the file extension.

I had some luck with pdfminer i think it has what you are looking for.
Python is what I used to code the logic behind the motion. So, theoretically, the ‘shades’ as I call them, are just projections of the underlying data. In this program, janky as it is, it stores the positions of equal slices of a circle, starts a loop to draw each frame, in each frame: draws the shade where it should be according the next place in the list, outputs that frame into an image file, in this case png. and then *I* used gimp to transform those frames into a gif. In order to output the data to an image you have to find a renderer that you like. I used Cairo which makes svg files, so I also had to learn how to code svg stuff but it was simple enough. I like svg because it scales really well and I wanted to use vector graphics.

There is no other explanation, either the python is not installed or it is not in the sys path :)
You're gonna be "new to python" if someone else is doing your work. Just write the code in a language you know (C or Java) then try and find out how to implement each part of your code in Python.
I am attempting to use google maps to find local parking lots within a specific area. I know that some type of satellite image analysis can be utilized, but this is somewhat new to me, so I don't know where to start. I need the code to be able to recognize multiple parking lots within a designated area, and the be able to create a dataframe that will output the coordinates and sq ft of the parking lot. Since most parking lots are dark gray, I believe that I would need to use a Google Maps API, then use satellite image analysis to scan and filter for images on Google Maps that look like a parking lot, such as square and rectangular shapes with dark gray color. It will also need to differentiate between other images in Google Maps such as the tops of buildings that also have a dark gray color and rectangular shape. Could someone give some advice on the best place to start learning how to build out this code? I believe that OpenCV and Tensorflow can be used to solve this proven, but how? 
 Your `Positions` can be greatly simplified: angle_step = 2 * math.pi / frame_count angles = (angle_step * i for i in range(frame_count)) coords = [( center[0] + radius * math.cos(x), center[1] + radius * math.sin(x)) for x in angles] self.final_coords = coords[phase:] + coords[:phase] ...but it's really strange that you made it a class. It looks more like a function to me! ----- Actually, there's a lot of redundancy, unnecessary computation, and confusing organization. Here's a first attempt at fixing it: import cairo import math class CelestialBody: def __init__(self, radius, orbit_radius, orbit_center, fill): self.radius = radius self.orbit_radius = orbit_radius self.orbit_center = orbit_center self.phase = 0.0 self.fill = fill self.update() def update(self): self.center = ( self.orbit_center[0] + self.orbit_radius * math.cos(self.phase), self.orbit_center[1] + self.orbit_radius * math.sin(self.phase)) def draw(self, context): context.set_source_rgb(1, 1, 1) context.arc(*self.center, self.radius, 0, 2 * math.pi) if self.fill: context.fill() else: context.stroke() def clear_screen(context): context.set_source_rgb(0, 0, 0) context.rectangle(0, 0, 1000, 1000) context.fill() surface = cairo.ImageSurface(cairo.FORMAT_ARGB32, 1000, 1000) context = cairo.Context(surface) FRAME_COUNT = 100 bodies = { 'blackhole': CelestialBody(125, 0, (500, 500), False), 'planet': CelestialBody(25, 300, (500, 500), True), 'moon': CelestialBody(5, 50, (750, 500), False) } for i in range(FRAME_COUNT): clear_screen(context) bodies['planet'].phase = i * 2 * math.pi / FRAME_COUNT bodies['moon'].phase = i * 4 * math.pi / FRAME_COUNT for key, body in bodies.items(): if key == 'moon': body.orbit_center = bodies['planet'].center body.update() for _, body in bodies.items(): body.draw(context) context.stroke() surface.write_to_png(f'out/frame{i}.png') This is a good start. We've eliminated `Positions`entirely and converted it into the `update` function. We're now using a data structure to keep track of our celestial objects rather than explicitly holding named references (variables). But it has some problems still. Inside our main loop, we still have to do some case-specific handling: bodies['planet'].phase = i * 2 * math.pi / FRAME_COUNT bodies['moon'].phase = i * 4 * math.pi / FRAME_COUNT for key, body in bodies.items(): if key == 'moon': body.orbit_center = bodies['planet'].center Ugh! It'd be much nicer if we could encapsulate this functionality. Perhaps one idea is to *bind* our celestial bodies together: class CelestialBody: def __init__(self, radius, orbit_radius, orbit_center, fill): self.parent_body = None # ... def bind_body(self, body): self.parent_body = body def update(self): if self.parent_body is not None: self.orbit_center = self.parent_body.center # ... Now, after defining `bodies`, we may bind them: bodies['planet'].bind_body(bodies['blackhole']) bodies['moon'] .bind_body(bodies['planet']) Now we can finally cut out this horrendous if statement: if key == 'moon': body.orbit_center = bodies['planet'].center Yay! I'll leave encapsulation of the following as an exercise to the reader: bodies['planet'].phase = i * 2 * math.pi / FRAME_COUNT bodies['moon'].phase = i * 4 * math.pi / FRAME_COUNT ---- See [almost-encapsulated code here]().
I think this is done using a neural network, sadly I cant tell you anywhere to learn, as I havent found such a site
Wow thanks.
`range` objects are not generators: py&gt; import inspect py&gt; inspect.isgenerator(range(100)) False py&gt; inspect.isgeneratorfunction(range(100)) False Nor are they iterators: py&gt; r = range(100) py&gt; iter(r) is r False They are lazy sequences. 
Your question is better suited for /r/learnpython. When you post there, please add the code in question, either formatted per the [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F).
yep, you are right
I did think about that while going through the process of refactoring. One idea would be to create a tree/graph structure of epicycles: class OrbitNode: def __init__(self): self.parent = None self.children = [] def update(self): if parent is not None: self.orbital_center = self.parent.center self.center = (..., ...) for child in self.children: child.update() And construct a tree as follows: blackhole.children = [planet] planet.children = [moon] planet.parent = blackhole moon.parent = planet Then, to compute positions of all the orbits: blackhole.update()
Fine.

Probably that Python is difficult to sandbox, while JS was built with sandboxing as a priority.
It's flat in the animation too, I'm sure the poster could have easily made it a 3D oval shaped object if he believed it would be more accurate...
When asked to visualize how learning a language feels, I could come up with this. First you look at a great number of unknown concepts, that you then look at and study one by one. Then you look at a great number of familiar concepts, until you realize that many concepts are really just a special case of another concept. So eventually you just look at a small number of familiar concepts. For me some key realizations are: ### Everything is an object. Functions, Types, Classes, Iterators, .etc. all are objects in Pyhton. Wich means they can be passed around, be assigned to variables or be tampered with by monkey patching. ### Variable lookups and scopes When and how a variable is available at what time can be a bit confusing at first, because it differs a bit from language to language. So make yourself familiar with [how Python looks up variables](http://stupidpythonideas.blogspot.com/2015/12/how-lookup-works.html) and how [scope works in Python.](https://python-textbok.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/Variables_and_Scope.html) For example: A variable defined in an `if` block can be accessed after the `if`-block because, unlike in other languages, `if`s don't have their own scope. ### Virtualenvs/Pip/PyPi This is not really a language aspect, but knowing how the ecosystem for Python works (How easy everything is, really) helps you liberate yourself from fiddling with dependencies and the like. Learn how to use virtualenvs directly or via virtualenvwrapper or pipenv or whatever and never again run into dependency hell. 
This is my first pip installable project. I was trying to build a command line tool to monitor remote ip's in my machine. 
Perfect! Now improve the model by making it 3D and an elipse [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Moon\_apsidal\_precession.png/220px-Moon\_apsidal\_precession.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Moon_apsidal_precession.png/220px-Moon_apsidal_precession.png)
stackoverflow is leaking, unfortunately. 
That was fast! It's working. Thank you!
The day I discovered metaprogramming, or David beazly in general xD. 
If you need an empty "sentinel" object, just create one with `object()`.
&gt;It's very popular in Node frameworks[...] I tell myself that it has _something_ to do with Node's async nature. But what do I know...
[removed]
Well, this seems way more canonical than my empty list! Thanks.
It could be that too. I see planes or people. Could be lots of stuff.
So he IS australian huh?
Can you change it to an ellipse?
You should put it on github! People could send you pull requests, you could re-use it, people could find it in searches...
I might do something like that in the future once I start getting it more structured.
A new Aurora implementation?
What do you mean by flatten? 
Correct answer. Super simple too. What does suck is that QT Creator is a shit Python IDE. Kdevelop is actually pretty fantastic for Python + QT. I actually made a number of apps with Kdevelop + QT Designer and it was a wonderful experience. Kdevelop had some ridiculously good Python intellisense back in the day, but I don't know what what it's like today... I use Pycharm now since I rarely do desktop development anymore. If you want to do fancy GUIs the QML is pretty awesome. 
Very nice.
After you get yours hands dirty from amateur web scraping, hosting a web app with Django/Flask, deploying a package on PyPI, having fun with building Raspberry Pi robots, simulating the physical world, getting PEP8 all right without using a linter, touching all edges where Python is inappropriate, and eventually writing a Python compiler, then you know about mastery.
A lot of people use PyCharm, but be aware that if you need to do full stack development, the community version does not support javascript. I think PyCharm is a great IDE for python development, but it's a real pity that they went for a design focused specifically on languages. I often use multiple languages at once in one project. The should have had one IDE and pluggable support for the languages you paid for, instead of forcing me to start PyCharm on the python part of my project, and CLion on the C++ part. 
May I see your code?
Ok thats awesome, thanks for helping!
I always thought that these medium articles were submitted to an editor who approved them. Guess not. Any discussion of generators that mentions neither generator functions or generator expressions is leaving out so much as to be useless. 
How would you compare your skills in analytics then (before using Python and pandas) and now? 
what is Jupyper notebooks?
Is it flat or not? Can't see i properly from this angle. 
Use ellipsis! Syntax: ... Ellipsis are only used in the standard library for slicing, so unlike None which could be a valid value, ellipses are safe to use. Plus the look really cool
This is a nice toy project. A couple of notes: * Would be easier to follow and focus on functionality if the code stuck to PEP8. Here are some obvious ones: * Long lines * No need to import entire modules when you could do with explicit objects (e.g. \`from requests import post\` vs. \`import requests\`) * An needless abundance of whitespace * These issues can be solved with a linter like \`flake8\` * Now, the actual logic: * \`while(True):\` is bad for all kinds of reasons. In this case specifically, I can imagine an uncaught error leading to pegging \`github.io\`'s API and leading to a series of sad failures * The two success cases are redundant and you could benefit from some DRY to unify them (L63, L68) * No need to re-declare \`custom\` and \`url\`, redundant * Things to look into and learn: * f-strings are cool * \`entry\_points\` in \`setup.py\`, preferred over \`if \_\_name\_\_ == "\_\_main\_\_": ...\` * PEX * Branch naming * Release strategy and versioning * \*tests\* Good luck!
No. It's just a blogging platform that for some reason everybody started using (and I don't understand why, the format is really unpleasant to read, especially if you read from a widescreen monitor)
http://jupyter.org You can write and execute your code in there. People love it because it allows you to write and test code quickly. Eg: in a big script, you don’t need to run everything, you can run cell by cell and see results d you go. They are very visual. Very good for presentations and sharing. 
Have you looked at Visual Studio? I am on a Mac and use Visual Studio Code for all my Python work. Prior to that I was an Eclipse guy using the PyDev plugin. best of luck to you whatever you choose.
I got that, I need to learn how to make my own Haar Cascades, which I see may be pretty challenging to do.

Working with connectwise API to present a forecast on resource availability and work load
&gt; The should have had one IDE and pluggable support for the languages you paid for You're describing their main IDE, IntelliJ. Some QoL things won't be available IIRC, but the core support for other languages is literally just a plugin. 
You misspelled the url in `setup.py`.
Still too far away. Knowing the core language (includes obscure (but supported) meta-programming features) doesn't tell you about your mastery over the language. Knowing good usecases and design patterns for each of those features make you an expert. But then there's so much more to a language than just knowing the core features and syntax. - Standard library, for all (broad) usecases - Knowing how modules are found, how concurrency works, how memory is managed. - Then there are the implementation details. Different types of python interpretters, and when to use which. - Oh, and the "actual" implementation details. CPython internals, implementing DSLs in python, embedding python interpreter inside something. And then you might call yourself an advanced Pythonista, but still a useless one. For being useful, you need to know one or more frameworks inside out. Things like full stack development using Python, or knowing the scipy-numpy-spark-pandas-matplotlib-numba stack. And even if you are somehow done with all this, you can still watch a couple Pycon talks and be humbled. I'm nowhere close to have mastered Python, but I wanna point out that if you think you're close because you know Generators, then boy are you wrong!
I might be wrong, but ai think OpenCV provides you with the Haar cascade system and you just need to train it -which is where the trickiness comes in. For training, you need a dataset to train it on, which I assume you do not have?
 alias pip=pup
&gt;When this big gap is filled in there will be GUI and off the shelf scripts (to call them so) to deal with most of the regular stuff we are now struggling to work with (ex I wish I had the TextSFM module two three years ago when I needed. I had to spend some good months writing the equivalent code, not so smart and neat but it did the job) GUIs are fundamentally unsuitable for so much devops, sysops, etc. work for several reasons but largely because it's impossible to version and diff a gui and tracking is hard. Using a language that can be committed to source control solves all of those problems and is easier to build to boot. Far from being more common, I reckon that YAML/Python will end up encroaching on even more domains where a GUI used to run things, with YAML covering the core use cases while being able to drop down in to python for custom work where flexibility is required.
I am not an expert on Visual Studio, but a colleague used it seamlessly between python and C++. This is currently not possible with PyCharm, and I am unsure if it's possible with IntelliJ (which is, apparently, Java focused). 
So, I was hoping to reduce the size by taking the “layers” out and just returning a graphic based file. As an example, I’ve got a 100 page pdf with layers, and it is 70mb. I “print” it from adobe and select Microsoft pdf writer, and the layers get flattened out and it’s size reduces to 30mb. 
I have used python professionally for a couple of years now and I wish I’d found this website when I was first starting out. Great recommendation! I only wish I could give you more than one upvote.
oh! never seen that before. Looks pretty handy! thanks mate!
Anvil might be an option for you: https://anvil.works/ (But it is for web-based apps, not for creating desktop programs)
I was not very clear on that There will be a GUI like Ansible Tower and lots of REST/api/screen scrapping scripts in the background. My point was that you writing code most of the time will not be necessary as it is today when the APIs are there but we are still writing scripts to use most of them 
I have their "All Tools" pack so I have all of their IDEs. In IntelliJ IDEA I have JetBrain's official Python and PHP plugins as well as a 3rd party Perl plugin, among many others. There's no issue jumping between any supported language in a single project. I personally rarely touch Java.
This looks fun. I have been trying to install pycairo for a bit now I have installed Python 3 but I'm having issues to install Cairo vía pip. how can I get it working? 
Score. Always good to convert.
TIL something new, thanks!
yes i have installed visual studio c++ and now i gues this error error: command 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\Community\\VC\\Tools\\MSVC\\14.15.26726\\bin\\HostX86\\x86\\cl.exe' failed with exit status 2 
I have no idea what that is.
Lol my slogan is "get shit done", and yes I already use PyInstaller with it. I remember posting an issue on your git with the os.fork problem in Windows causing issues with multiprocessing using pysimplegui. I've since moved my code to multi threading instead.
how you got Cairo to install?
Visual Studio is nice. I have used it mainly for C but it also works well with Python. If you get the community edition it will be free but Microsoft will invade your privacy by requesting you to log in with your microsoft account.
I told you I downloaded the package and used setup.py with pip. I couldn’t download Cairo just from pip
I downloaded the package from the site I linked.
Yo OP. I'm a Senior Data Analyst who's doing the same thing as you! I'm about a month and a half in. And OH. MY. GOD. I'm never looking back. At this point I save \~4 hrs a week with my munging scripts and climbing! As the top post recommends, take a look at Pandas (and Numpy). With that said, there's a LOT to learn. Keep the mindset "marathon not sprint" or you'll get burnt out fast. "I can do this in excel, no problem, why the heck am I wasting time trying to replicate this in Python?". Ignore the thought and stick with it! Get comfortable with your code not working, banging your head against the wall, passing out, waking up and then using resources online to find solutions. &amp;#x200B; In my short time, here's what I've found useful: \-A very popular Python help-themed discord: [https://discord.gg/8NWhsvT](https://discord.gg/8NWhsvT) \-StackOverflow I use everyday for solutions as well: [www.stackoverflow.com](https://www.stackoverflow.com) \-Pandas Bible: [https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html#module-pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html#module-pandas) &amp;#x200B; Excited for you! 
I also would like to see this applied to other fields, I'm attempting to make a game bot with just image processing, and need to find where monsters are with just screen captures.
&gt; My point was that you writing code most of the time will not be necessary Nope, but predicting where the code *will* be necessary and building a means of allowing its use in those situations is very, very hard. This is, I think, why we're often writing scripts today to do things we used GUIs for in the past. Those GUIs were useful up to a point and then you needed some kind of custom behavior and it was simply impossible to do that with a GUI.
I think Ctrl+Shift+L formats files according to the format

I think learning functional programming in Haskell, never using it, then coming back to Python and start programming functionally was definitely one of those moments that made me feel like I'd understood the language. I do remember the joke where writing tests is a better sign of python mastery than decorators
I've had a few tbh, the most recent is actually AST manipulation to change python code on the fly. I finally understand all the libraries like py.test and others so I feel very accomplished. I've never really used it anywhere
I’m a network engineer/architect turned software developer at a major cloud provider. We basically no longer interview or hire network engineers that can’t code. It’s a hard job requirement at scale. Python is very popular in network management. Yaml and assorted implementations (ansible, etc) have proven not expressive enough for complex networking control. We still have dedicated “compiled JIT language” programmers with CS background for some big hard problems (graph stuff, simulation). We have done a lot with python though (netmiko, celery, textfsm, Stackstorm etc). 
So how do you feel about your feature in coding ? I must say that a major cloud provider will allways be on the edge and have work for its programmers. not everybody will work for such an outfit though I know it is difficult but what would you say it is your level of knowledge in programming ? How deep do you Python ? 
Just for clarity: You don't need to buy the all products pack for this. AFAIK you only need IntelliJ to use the other language plugins. 
I remember a pycon talk in which this lady wrote a preprocess to covert all python3 syntax (including classes, imports) to a single line lamda expression.
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should.
Any language that offers the possibility to send serial command could be used to control that device. So if Python has PySerial to do that, and that allows you to send serial command, then yes, you can use Python.
I’m a senior developer and technical lead, so I mentor our junior developers etc. I personally see plenty of interesting work and opportunities as a developer with domain expertise. I also like to switch it up and do new things every few years and having solid Dev experience makes you more portable. More and more businesses are moving into the cloud. even if they don’t go all-in, you may end up supporting a hybrid of on-prem and cloud, with associated network complexities. Good to have Dev skill set in that environment too.
That’s what was probably used to onelinerize the code in this kind of series of posts (like MD5, SHA one-liners). I’m not sure one can be genius enough to write such huge one-liners themselves. 
Sounds like you have people who work for you (they will do the coding) and you give them directions You did not answer the questions regarding the skills level you expect from your engineers or even from a new hire in your team
Important to note that VS and VS code are very different things.

Are you saying that your project depends on external libraries/packages?
I figured it out, I needed to use input for rate, not hard code it.
This would be an amazing clock widget that I would want on my phone. 
I’m not a manager currently. I write code every day. I thought “senior developer, technical lead ” answered your question about skill level but I guess I could rephrase as “expert in python”...? We hire at various experience levels — minimum bar would probably be a working knowledge of basic types and data structures, object oriented programming, and commonly used design patterns. New grads have slightly different expectations due to the lack of experience and domain knowledge — typically looking for high drive, passion for learning, solid fundamentals in CS.
VS Code has become my goto.
I'll wait until he abandons it before trying it. All of his projects get better once other people start maintaining them.
To clarify, I am entering like 20-30 of these a day sometimes. Not just trying to duck out of 5 minutes of work ;)
Good job. If you need to do something that cant be done with key presses, look into Selenium for browser applications and pywinauto (windows ui atomation and win32 apis) for desktop applications. With these you can locate the actual elements and interact with them. So you can automate basicly anything.
Thanks for the info! I wasn't sure if Python would be the easiest or the best to use for what I needed but I decided to give it a shot. I'll look into something a little more streamlined like you suggest in the future. 
Python is amazing, I use it most for automation. Both Selenium and pywinauto are Python frameworks.
This is getting lots of downvotes but it is a real python curiosity, thanks for sharing !
You rock man! I really appreciate your comment. I'll definitely take a look at all those materials. Anything worth mentioning you now do differently at work that you could point out for me? Just a couple of examples would be nice to hear about!
Pycharm allows you to reformat code trivially and if you let it, will do so on each commit. I remember seeing something about having Jinja2 automatically being the default assumed template language thus you don't even need to specify it. Can't quite remember how. Regardless, it definitely requires enabling django support for the project. Then reformatting all the code in the project is as simple as a right click and reformat. 
This is what Python is all about. Great work and I can't wait to read more success stories. Also, I've been doing Python for years now and this is the first I read about the package you used for key presses. I'll be checking it out now!
put the else on the same level as the if. ``` if name == 'alice': print('hi') else: print('bye') ``` 
wow, congratz
The "else:" should to be on the same indent level as the "if" You'll get used to it don't worry :)
I'm not a PEP 8 nazi or anything, but this makes me start twitching a little bit.
[PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org)was recently released is great for beginners and can also be used for more complex GUIs when you're ready. It wraps tkinter, providing you with all of the tkinter widgets. It's a lot simpler and more compact than straight tkinter code. Take a look at the [Cookbook](http://cookbook.pysimplegui.org) and you'll get an idea of just how small the code is for a custom GUI layout. You can copy and paste a recipe's code and be up and running in 5 minutes. The window code that defines the window resembles the window's appearance. There is extensive documentation should you want to get into the more complex applications. &amp;#x200B;
Testing is damn hard tbf
&gt; The files are not included in the package Why not? The way I see it there are 2 choices. - If they're small/simole enough to generate, just include them. - If they're simple enough to generate, you don't need to store them. &gt; it's just an egg file Use a wheel. Eggs are deprecated. &gt; Where should I put these files? I'd put them in the wheel or not generate them.
 I’ve got this relatively big (at least for me; I’m doing a bigger one right now, but it’s currently a total mess) project called [PyVM](https://github.com/ForceBru/PyVM) that lets one execute flat x86 binaries in pure Python and no external dependencies. So, a while ago it had a completely different structure, and after some struggling with it (cuz it was hard to add new implementations of instructions) I decided to roll a completely new structure of the code. I wrote it down on a piece of paper and then carefully implemented it while being unable to test whether it works while doing this because it brought _huge_ changes to the very core of the project. Then I hit the Run button. _IT FREAKING WORKED!!_ Right after some hour of just writing code and not testing whether it worked. Yeah, that’s how you understand you’ve mastered anything: when what you created works as expected without “debugging on-the-fly”, a.k.a. testing if smaller pieces work before launching the whole thing. Not saying that one shouldn’t test the smaller pieces, of course. 
Ah you want to rasterise it. I'd honestly just use something like popen and make use of imagemagick's `convert` or `pdf2ps`. Easiest by far. 
check out /r/learnpython
This is one of the main problems I have with python.. Scope is determined by invisible characters. 
Outdent the else to match the if
This is solved guys I'm trying to mark it solved on mobile but eh idk
Cool idea! Update us on how that goes, I'm interested to see what you can do with it.
I've successfully scraped the times for the games, now I'm just working on getting a list of the games I own on steam which is a pain. On another note howlongtobeat. Com already does this if you import your steam profile, but the learning aspect of this project is the reason I'm doing it. And oh how I've learned a lot. 
Nice job, I like to play with python stuff too. But sometimes, I should have used a spreadsheet as Excel or Libre office. What kind of processing do your app? (yes. I'm an Excel and vba enthusiast). 
The list we are working with is a list in a list. So I need to access a list for one player inside the list representing the entire roster.
Tbh, Excel macros can make it work 99% of the time, and you can deploy it easily. If you send your python code to someone else, he must install python. Everyone have Excel, but not Everyone has admin rights to install python 
freezing tho. 
Yeah I came upon that realization after the fact. In reality, no one in my (small) local office has to enter the same data that I do. There would be no one that could benefit directly that I would trust. I'm not sending this to our corporate office haha. Only for personal use. I was considering trying to convert to an .exe file somehow. Still, the user would have to have Python installed on the PC at the very least right?
My two bits here would be python in itself is a very unique language and the reason why it’s becoming so popular is because it’s ‘almost pseudo code’ and it supports literally everything in the fastest way possible. As far as the GUIs are concerned, I think it does have a huge gap when it comes to user experience which imhowever can be bridged by using a framework of your choice. Everything else I believe is super helpful, there’s a little bit of learning curve though but if you’re really willing, you’ll be amazed! P.S. I’m a Software Developer and I’ve been using python for Web Development, Data processing and automation scripting! 
if you're entering 20-30 of these a day it may be better to build a list of values for each entry and then pass them into your program all at once 
Good job. I love the comment at the bottom :P
Meanwhile I can't even finish the python tutorial on sololearn. At this point I'm willing to sacrifice a limb to have better understanding of the python language. 
When I, a self taught tester, was asked for advice by a lead developer.
the beauty, the zen, the easiness and the complexity of python makes me stuck with it and unable to learn any other language because...it is so easy in Python ... Not sur ehow we ended up discussing GUIs here, they lost the battle with CLI and REST APIs and the likes. I mentioned GUI as a interface to launch scripts based on the above, premade by vendors ...you will enter just the params via a GUi (ex: what set of devices to run the script on and what vlan number to create) but the scripts will be there no need to write them for most of the things we do 
Instead of that sacrifice a few hours a week man. There are no blood rituals IRL, if you cant even finish basic tutorials you need to figure out what youre doing wrong.
I think my problem is that I'm trying to fit it in where possible which is too small a period and by the time I get back to it I've already forgotten what I've learned. Wish I could take time off just to learn but I don't even have a practical use for it yet. Just something I want to tick off my bucket list to learn a programming language. I feel like once I am confident in python I'll try to apply it to all sorts of scenarios day to day. 
Still learning and very new at Python. I created a simple script that creates a "DNA chain" with a variable length and complexity. Figured I could make some interesting cell biology simulations with it. Without getting too complex on the biology end (my field), the user picks a length for the DNA chain. It's randomly generated and effectively cut into segments, which each code for a simple trait of the "animal". Right now I have speed, maneuverability, color, complexity and size. It's a little pointless right now as the animals don't do anything. But I was able to convert it to another platform I'm more comfortable in and [have some pretty basic visualizations now.](https://gfycat.com/UnfinishedCanineArieltoucan) I'm wondering if I can do the same in pygame? It was pretty cool to lean back and see all the various cells being created. Now I'd just like them to interact a little bit and have some basic functions. Then I might move onto another project. But right now, I'm having fun with it!
It's basically impossible to get accurate measurements for usage of programming languages. Any statistics that simply claims a number without a *huge* disclaimer in front of it should automatically be treated as made up bullshit.

I frankly feel GUI should be mostly we based because mostly every machine where you have a GUI will have a browser so might as well go with a web framework and make your user experience better! 
Fantastic! You know what exciting code is? Code that makes you happy. You have created exciting code. Well done.
thanks, I hate it
Why the mogwai meme? Just stop
The thing is, each value will be unique to each entry. So the 15 or whatever variables on the gui will all change each time I run the code. Unless I am missing something? Could you give me an example maybe? Thanks for taking a look.
Good effort lad, I remember being at the exact same stage when i started out.
Hi, I just find that image very deep and the track 'Take me somewhere nice' is also beautiful. Didn't got what you imply by 'Just stop'.
He means that you're getting variables or text to put in from somewhere so why not read that data in instead of bothering to type it into this at all. (I think)

I believe if you use pyinstaller to create the executable, it will come with a bundled python interpreter. 
Ah. The variables are coming from printed documents. So that's not really possible. It would be nice though...
Of course I don't know what your priorities are but in general doing incredible things has nothing to do with mastering a programming language. You can do great things with mediocre or even basic knowledge of the language. And that's what usually actually matters. What's the deepest knowledge good for if you don't know what to use it for or how to apply it and, sometimes even more important, *when* to apply it. In most cases you don't want to write clever or genius code, you want to write code that other people can quickly understand and change. So, I'd argue focus on approaching problems and knowing when and how to apply general concepts is much more important than "mastering" a programming language. 
Until you called it BOL I genuinely thought you were someone at my company and I was going to take offense, as I haven't tried to streamline our data entry of the same information yet so you would have beaten me to it 
I approached it from the opposite way. I had a problem and I was determined to find a way to solve it. To be honest, I got pretty bored with some of the codeacademy lessons. They do a good job of presenting a problem and having you find out how to solve it, but the tedium of solving these fictional issues was lost on me. The bigger picture of syntax, variables, functions, and all those types of basic understandings of the language itself are what was really helpful. It was hard, not going to lie. But I took a lot of reference from other people's code to help me. The hardest work was already done for me. All I did was make it work for what my needs were. I'd recommend trying to find a problem that you know you can solve with coding and working from there. Take a practical approach, instead of trying to learn code for the sake of learning code, thinking "Oh yeah I can do SOOO much with this" but never actually produce anything beneficial. My 2 cents as someone who is only starting out. 
take a picture, OCR, python-magic more time for reddit.
Thanks. I'm always happy to receive advice on this type of thing especially from a fellow beginner. 
A 2d gravity simulator (newtonian laws) with Pygame. Every movements are ruled by the gravity and inertia, absolutely no body has a scripted path.

It's applications are constantly evolving, as I learn more code, but right now I've rolled out two things: (1) I work in a department where I'm constantly emailed .docx files...lots of them...containing data that I need to report on. Previously, I had to go into each file, tediously search for the fields/cells I needed, and copy/paste them into excel for calculations. Now, whenever I receive a new .docx file, I just dump it into a directory I have tied to a py script that does everything for me. everything. Literally hours/days of work over the year, reduced to typing "&gt;&gt;&gt;Python kick\_ass\_script.py" a couple times a month. Eventually, I plan to ask my department to just "drop-off" the files into the directory I'm using (to get rid of the email component) but I haven't worked out the kinks on that just yet. (2) I regularly pull data off a huge SQL database (via a web app) clean it, and report on it to stakeholders. Previously, I had to spend hours and hours cleaning the output for errors (human/machine errors) and then aggregate it based on my department's classification system. Now, I have a py script now that does 100% of the cleaning and 99% of the aggregation. Hours per week saved. Eventually, I'll automate this further (connecting to sql via python, pulling data, that-1%, reporting, etc, etc) but tackling the biggest time-suck of cleaning that darn mess needed to be taken care of first. Oh, and when new human/machine errors surface? That's just a couple more lines of code my friend. \^lots of head-banging (behind closed doors) but worth every second.
Python has a lot of branches where you can freelance, here are some examples of the libraries you will need: ## Web development * Django * Flask + plugins * SQLAlchemy * aiohttp * HTML, CSS and JavaScript (if you want to do front end aswell) ## Desktop development * PyQt / Qt for Python / WxPython * Requests / websockets / aiohttp * SQLite / other DB API 2.0 libraries ## Data Analysis and Data Mining * Requests * BeautifulSoup / lxml / selenium * pandas * matplotlib / seaborn / other viz libraries * NumPy ## Machine Learning * scikit-learn * statsmodels * Tensorflow
&gt; Relatively fast I'd argue it's slow, relative to other languages. But it is fast enough for most use cases.
now is your time to shine!
But I'm soooooo busy *reloads the same page for the 500th time* I'm free now though, so I guess you're right haha 
Would be faster to tab/type through the values on the GUI, no? Really there are only 15 variables (less are needed depending on what I am entering). And the information I need is on like 4 different printed out pages. Scanning and pulling the info I need from them sounds worse than what I was doing before ha

Each document could be a row in a spreadsheet, and then you run the program against the spreadsheet.
My only advice is stop using TKINTER and learn to love the command line. Half of your code could have been replace with just a few lines from `Argparse`.
flake8 wants you to give back the bits used for this.
You could use a .csv file to pass to your program. Use excel and dedicate one row for each document. Save your file a .csv and pass it to your pysthon program. 
Yes, I wrote this and all the other one-liners myself (SHA1, SHA256 and TOTP) without using this or any other "one-linerizer". Of course it's not very easy and takes some time to do something like this but if it is possible to write a program that does it automatically then it must be possible to do it yourself when you know some tricks.
A lot of my work stuff takes a nicely formatted spreadsheet as custom input. It's a nice and familiar place for a lot of people so it's really easy to train out: "your spreadsheet should contain x, y, z, then save it and click this button"
Pyautogui is great. Like OP, I have to deal with clunky software on a regular basis. Not for data entry, but for data retrieval. I have to get four huge csv's and one huge pdf out of this software pretty much every day to feed to one of my main reporting scripts. Between these five files, it takes over an hour for the software to export it all. So I wrote a script using pyautogui to automate the process and then set Task Scheduler to run it every morning at 6AM, and now the files are already there and waiting for me when I get in in the morning.
Try: import divinity 
dude, use pastebin
WTF? Did that guy write a decision tree for every single possible move and just do a bunch of print statements for each one??!!
&gt; Still, the user would have to have Python installed on the PC at the very least right? i'm kind of confused on that part. So there's no way bundled with the language to convert to an exe, but there are 3rd party tools to do it. The tools basically package a copy of python in with the executable to provide the runtime environment encapsulated within the exe. So no, they wouldn't need python installed. I've used pyinstaller before. It's pretty easy to wire up.
When you need to go really fast. But, more likely, you'll know when you need something else. Until that time comes, keep working to find that limit.
I have in the comments. :)
Thank you!
Unfortunately the entry data comes from printed documents. So this was the most practical way I could think of to pull the data.
Hey, here's a useful tip: Save locations on UI as an array and then use the array name for click functions, this makes the code more readable and if a button changes its location, you just have to change the array and not every instance of its coordinates. Like so save_button = [1089, 568] And then click it using pyautogui.click(save_button)
If you are already using Poetry, please read carefully the release notes since there are some breaking changes in dependency resolution process. Other than that, here is what's new: * Brand new installer which will improve the overall experience of installing Poetry. * Improvements in the way Poetry resolves dependencies, especially conditional dependencies. * Poetry now provides a PEP-517 compliant build system. * Multiple constraints support. * Renaming of the lockfile from `pyproject.lock` to `poetry.lock` for clarity.
Wow, so proud to be in your list :)
I'm new here... sorry!
And what use in the meantime ?
'From tiny acorns, and so on...'
I'm new to reddit and it's great to see you here. I learned a lot from your channel. I'm hoping you can do a video about threading. It would help a lot :)
Your post was very informative. Thank you for writing that one.
Bottle, Flask, and Cherrypy come to mind just looking at the documentation. Django and Pyramid are also options if you want something bigger.
Tested and works. I'm not sure what to do with the knowledge that something like this is capable of existing.
Have you tried `cpdf -compress` ? cpdf is a free tool available at https://community.coherentpdf.com/
I'm adding my voice to OP's. the way i've learned it was picking one of the problems i'm facing on daily bases, and try to solve it by searching: "python for loop", "numpy array transpose" .. etc. with time, you'll gather more python vocabulary, your searching will get quicker, and more direct. you'll get the hang of it with time. and the euphoria you get after solving a problem on your own gives you a good motivation to carry one. i'd also advise you to use jupyter notebook / jupyter lab as your coding medium, the interactiveness of writing something and running it, and seeing the results in the same spot helps you comprehend your work and bugs in a visual way that's quite easy to follow. never watched a video, or followed a tutorial to the letter .. i don't find it useful or motivating, your own stuff, your own problems that you can solve with a python code brings you closer to understanding and "feeling" the language. good luck!
when performance is the key factor in your software. or i personally think you should not build the web with python, not because python sucks, but node is superior in web
Thank you. I'm taking in all the advice I can get. I really appreciate it. 
Java not being popular for IoT devices? That really depends on the definition of devices I'd say. 
Awesome. I'm sure you know this already but the csv package is pretty dope too
I guess he generated the decision tree, but yes, that’s the code. 
How do you get the values that you type in manually into your gui? Could these be exported by whatever other program generates them? If you can get them easier in a spreadsheet or text file then you could feed it in as a dictionary or list into your current program. 
I second this. There are a few catches, like executing on the same OS as packaged, but overall it is pretty neat and works! 
How did you find the correct pause times? When you start working with selenium, I think you will like expected conditions and the implicit waits for elements the program interacts with.
I freeze the script then send it to a virtual machine (which has no python installation) to run the exe file. Works like a magic.
Correct me if I’m wrong, but pyautogui.PAUSE = 0.1 Sets a wait time of 0.1 seconds for each pyautogui call, which means you don’t have to write it that many times. Just re-set it to another value when another block of code requires a different wait time. 
As someone with strong protan, thank you!
I can't believe they passed on calling it QtPy.
On the official site: http://python.org
It was just trial and error for the most part. I am so familiar with the software I use that I was able to estimate how long to pause. I would run the script, and if I did not get the intended result I would modify it. I didn't fully understand the pause command with pyautogui when I started. By the time I realized it just used the last pause value, I had already blown up my code with pause commands every other line. I started cleaning it up, but it doesn't affect the performance so I just said screw it. I think the longest wait I have in there is 5.5 seconds. There is a lot of room to streamline the pauses so that it is more fluid, but like I said it is all trial and error. Sometimes the system hangs longer usual and I have to take into account when the software is being slow. 
Thank you! Yeah I didn't fully understand how the pause command worked until I was pretty far in. Hence the mega redundancy throughout.
Thanks!!
The thing that sucks is that these values are not listed on every document at the same location, or even on the same page. There are hundreds and the information I need could be in a completely different place on each document. [They are import shipping documents like this.](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GGRV_enUS751US751&amp;biw=1422&amp;bih=686&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=oazHW5rpAoPT8APf5pu4CQ&amp;q=import+bill+of+lading&amp;oq=import+bill+of+lading&amp;gs_l=img.3...0.0..1867...0.0..0.0.0.......0......gws-wiz-img.pTi0Ic2SsBM) Not exactly the easiest to automate, I would think. Some of the info is internal also, like shipper_num. It isn't listed anywhere on any document, I just have to type it in.
That genuinely deserves an award for the least efficient code ever written
Thanks for the help! I will definitely make note. I initially had each function written as a different script to run individually. Decided to throw it all together to make this monster. There is a lot of code optimization to be had, and I am taking everyone's input.
Thanks! Tkinter was a pain. Making GUI's is fun though. I like the idea of it being something anyone user could potentially benefit from without being saavy with cmd or scripts in general.
I'll look into it! Thank you !

It sucks because the info is not in the same place on every document. They aren't standardized. And some of the info, like shipper_num, is not printed on the doc but comes from an internal# that can only be looked up in our software (after navigating through like 5 windows). Everyone is saying I should use OCR and the like, but I can't imagine it would save me any time. I can type these values into the GUI in about 10-15 seconds. 
go ask your TA during office hours
/r/learnpython may be of help, but this looks more like a Stack Overflow question. And actually it looks like homework. Terms such as "relative error willing to accept" are not common knowledge and might need some explaining. 
Thanks :) I am blown away by the positive reception I am getting. Everyone is so nice, and I feel very proud of what I was able to do. It makes me excited to keep on learning!
Genius. Working when you're not even at work.
Bug? &amp;#x200B; `vector2.append(float(input1[k]))` I think you mean to append to vector2 the *values of input2* given the *keys of input1*, not the values of input1, because the latter makes vector1 and vector2 trivially identical. As a side-note, you are missing out on a lot of the nice Python stuff. For example, Python is dynamically typed, so you don't need to initialize input1, input2, vector1, for example. And at some point you might want to check out list comprehensions to make some stuff more compact.
That is like asking "When should I not use a screwdriver". 
If it's machine written, ask whoever prints them to give you the file? 
Oh I see what you are saying now. I am considering doing something like that now based on your and others' advice. Do it all in one go so I don't have to even look at the screen through the lot of them.
Got it. Yeah that might save some more time. To work!
How is SQL obscure? :S
Thanks! I'll look into it 
Everyone else is recommending something very similar. It is hard in my case because the info is pulled from printed documents [like this](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GGRV_enUS751US751&amp;biw=1422&amp;bih=686&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=oazHW5rpAoPT8APf5pu4CQ&amp;q=import+bill+of+lading&amp;oq=import+bill+of+lading&amp;gs_l=img.3...0.0..1867...0.0..0.0.0.......0......gws-wiz-img.pTi0Ic2SsBM). They vary wildly in where the information I need is stored on the page, and every one is different. There is no standardization to tell the computer where to pull the data from, even with using something like OCR. Some of the data (like shipper_num) is an internal# that is only unique to our system. There wasn't even an easy way for me to pull that info from our system. I see what everyone is trying to recommend to me and I wish I could think of a way that it would benefit. There are too many inconsistencies in the docs, though. 
I really enjoy using generators for scraping paginated content from a webpage. This way I could iterate over the entries until all pages are exhausted def get_items(): page = # get first page while True: my_item = # get the item yield my_item if next_page_exists: page = # get next page else: return

Wing IDE in tha house!
I feel like if I have to do that for every shipment it would take less time to enter into the GUI. I can do it in about 10-15 seconds. I have plenty of time to dwell on it though and think of what I might be able to do. I can't see myself leaving this job any time soon. Thanks for the input!
/r/learnpython and reinstall or check your environment variables.
Fair enough. You have to stop somewhere right? 
Seriously, the sooner you start using virtual environments for everything, the better your life will be. I've see so many coworkers over years up against deadlines, and they get everything barely working on their local machine, and when it comes time to deliver the product (deploy to a server or put scripts where they can be used in production or whatever) and the whole thing is fucked because everything depends on their personal system being set up just so, and it's been so long since they set it up, that they've completely forgotten how things even work anymore. &amp;#x200B; I had a job where my first task was to work on an app that had been broken-ish for months, but even though the team had the fix for the actual application code, no one could figure out how to deploy a fix to the server. Man, that server was messed up. Took me a couple of months to unwind the tangle of dependencies for that. &amp;#x200B; One thing I wish someone had done for me much earlier in my career is break down exactly what the virtual environment is. I just started using them as magic that made my life easier, but boy when things go wrong it sucks to not understand them. &amp;#x200B; Here's the deal. Python is no different than any other command on your system. It's a compiled executable that you can call by typing its name. It's just like ls (on \*nix) or dir (on Windows). At the system level, you can always use these commands because they are located in a directory that's in your PATH variable. That's just a list of places to look for programs to execute when you type in a command. No magic there either. In fact, you can create your own commands if you want. Like, I have a bash script that I use to create a new project. It does a few things like configure a Vagrant file, sym link to a data folder, create some code folders, and other stuff. And if you write your own such thing and make it executable and put it in a folder that's in your PATH, then you can have magic commands anywhere on your system too. &amp;#x200B; Python is just another one of these. It's a little binary that sits in a folder where the whole system can call it because certain core parts of \*nix system are developed in Python and need to be able to run Python programs anytime, anywhere to keep your computer running. &amp;#x200B; Python itself, can have lots of plugins and modules. That's what you are using pip for in the first place. The only thing that happens when you pip install something is that it puts another little binary in a folder that Python can see while it's running. Python has its own concept of a PATH variable. It looks for a folder called dist-packages and another folder called site-packages when your code tries to import a module. Those are all just little binaries that Python can call the same way you can type ls anywhere and see what files are in your location. &amp;#x200B; So, as I said above, Python isn't just there for convenience. It's there because the system needs it. And it needs exactly the modules that it ships with in exactly the versions it ships with for system processes to work. So when you pip install with sudo, you're messing with a key set of executables at the core of your OS, and when something breaks, it's not often easy to understand why. Because the OS doesn't just come out and tell you, "Oh oh. You've wrecked the system python, so now you're screwed." It will manifest in lots of really small ways with no explanation. I mean, I guess if you really hosed it. Like this one person I knew at a job that was trying to deploy an app that had a module that needed a newer version of Python to work. So he went and sudo'd everywhere and upgraded the system python from 2.6-something to 2.7-something. That was fun. &amp;#x200B; So what is a virtual environment? When you create a virtual environment, all you are doing is creating a copy of the Python executable, some core modules in the dist-packages folder, and (usually) en empty site-packages folder. That it. It's just a copy of some executables stored in a place where the user has permission to edit them (often in your user folder somewhere.) So then you don't have to sudo to do anything with it. Your user created that copy of Python and its bits and pieces, so you own it and can modify it willy nilly. &amp;#x200B; But what about the rest of it? How does your system magically know which python to use when you have a virtual environment running? The different virtual environment managers do things in slightly different ways, but it all boils down to changing your PATH. When you type a command, the system looks at your PATH for a list of places to look to execute that command. And it looks for them \*in order\*. So your PATH pretty much always has /usr/local/bin in there at the end. And your system Python is in there (probably?). But if you put /home/bill in the PATH at the front of the list, and /home/bill has python in it. You will run the Python that's in your home folder instead of the one that's in /usr/local/bin. &amp;#x200B; Anyway, that's all it really is. Copying executable files to locations where you have ownership and write access and then manipulating your PATH to execute those first when you type a command. So if that's ever seemed like a mystery to anyone, I hope this helps.
I'm going through selenium now and wow this is going to save me a lot of time with my unit tests
I love it! It's like that Calvin and Hobbes cartoon where Calvin is daydreaming about his school being simultaneously hit by a runnaway train, a crashing plane, and an earth quake all at once. Have an upvote. I especially love your comment about randomly changing the very last True to False to fix "weird looking output".
I've been pleasantly surprised as well. It has improved a lot over the last year, and the Python plugin works great.
I took the [MITx CS6.00](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.00.1x_7+3T2015/course/) class. Super worth it. You will struggle, but you'll come out with solid understanding much faster than just floating through a bunch of random tutorials (in my experience). Struggles are incredibly awesome for really learning the stuff. Hopefully you are on a Mac (or linux, even better). My anecdote to newbies is that 90% of my energy early on was burned getting tutorials and hello worlds to work on Windows. Come up with a super simple idea and build it. Give learning this stuff a fighting chance, you'll find out (somewhat) quickly* if you want to keep going. * There will be countless nights where you think "F this, I don't ever want to do Python again" and then maybe a day later you will get over whatever obstacle was in your way (good chance it has something to do with that Windows machine you're on haha) and your motivation comes back a little stronger
[https://github.com/therealrobster/randomFileCopyTool](https://github.com/therealrobster/randomFileCopyTool) I needed to fill a photo frame with photos every now and then. It was massively boring, but now it's done in about 2 minutes with this script. No more nagging from the better half to update the photos. Code is there for critique and improvement. Fork away if you wish. I hope someone finds it useful also. Can be used for any file type, not just jpg.
No problem! I think the biggest problem with envisage is that it is hard to explain what it \*isn't\* :) It isn't a way to model or design your applications, it isn't a UI framework (although the tasks stuff kind of is), it really is just a simple way to allow you to have a standard, discoverable way to make your applications extensible. Some day when I have time, I will right a traits-less version and some better docs! :)
&gt; Seriously, the sooner you start using virtual environments for everything, the better your life will be. I've see so many coworkers over years up against deadlines, and they get everything barely working on their local machine [...] and it's been so long since they set it up, that they've completely forgotten how things even work anymore. And then: &gt; One thing I wish someone had done for me much earlier in my career is break down exactly what the virtual environment is. I just started using them as magic that made my life easier, but boy when things go wrong it sucks to not understand them. Right, so let's see... everyone should use virtual environments, because they're a magic bullet that fixes dependency problems... until they go wrong, and you have to fix dependency problems in the virtual environment, and then they really suck unless you understand them in just as much hairy detail as you would need to understand a local deployment. I'm glad that virtual environments work for you, but dammit there is **nothing** I have read or experienced with them that makes me think they aren't just another version of [It's The Future](https://circleci.com/blog/its-the-future/). 
None of those are async by default. Are easly \*async\*able...
calm down, satan
Ah then from now on I'll be using sudo sudo sudo sudo pip install
For what do, web development and data analytics they work wonderfully and an essential part of my workflow.

&gt; Pyautogui is great. perhaps you could save me some time and tell me if you happen to know: - can it work with full screen apps? - can it interact with apps that run in another workspace in Linux (not the currently active workspace) A simple yes if you happen to know will suffice, if I can get a positive answer, it'll motivate me to bump the priority of diving into its docs

See if swap is enabled. If not, enable it.
A year from now you will hate your former self for all those three-letter function names, `oif` etc. Name them `for_what_they_do()`. You are by now ready to appreciate the [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) principle of software engineering! Make yourself some functions like def do_n_tabs(n): for i in range(n): pyautogui.press('tab') Calling `do_n_tabs(5)` will make your code more readable and easier to edit. When you have built up a little set of similar functions you have, in effect, begun to construct a [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) for this particular application domain -- which you can then save as an independent module and import to use with other programs! 
Basically rehashing what others here have said but I would put it this way, when there is a better suited tool for the job.

OCR can be a red herring; it's rarely accurate enough to leave unattened and needs manual checking and correction, which can be just as much work as was required in the first place :)
