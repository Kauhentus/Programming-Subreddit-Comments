I'm trying to use a Fortnite API to send me stats to a dashboard so I can keep create a cool visualization. I'm struggling currently because I can get a JSON object return when I put the API endpoint in an address bar but when I try it with my code I get an empty object. I'll figure it out eventually!
It’s only disappointing to someone with (possibly reasonable) expectations. Python already has an enormous ecosystem of re-usable code that can be combined and used however you want. And as I said its ecosystem positively dwarfs that of Julia, and will for likely a decade at least. Now you want Python to somehow retroactively apply a design goal of Julia’s as if it were a design goal of Python’s, and so you’re disappointed. Well that’s silly, in the same way that it’s silly when people are disappointed that Python isn’t statically typed or isn’t a purely functional language. Speed of execution is not Python’s goal... if anything Python’s goal is to make development iterations faster, and it serves that goal very well. Python inspired Julia... and that’s great. But the two languages now exist to fill different niches. Will Julia displace Python? No... it almost certainly won’t. It may take _some_ of the scientific programming work away, especially as it matures, just as Go has taken away _some_ web service work. And that’s because it’s more elegant at a more focused task. That’s great, not disappointing... new specialized tools in the toolbox are good, doesn’t mean you toss out the old generalized ones that still work for more jobs. Believe me people were more “disappointed” that C never adopted OOP from C++ then will ever be disappointed about Python not taking all of Julia’s ideas to heart. Lots of C still around. Lots of C still being written. If you like Julia, write Julia.
I'm teaching myself to code (again) and trying my hand at python this time around. Gotta get it in where I can. 
You mean index match, right?
Not sure how index match works on panda. I was referring to the end of the article that mentioned there’s no VLookup

Sometimes! For example, psycopg2 (a popular database driver for Python) recommends that you install it from source, and will print a warning on startup if you installed the wheel. However, you might not be able to compile from source for some packages, because they only compile in certain environments. It depends on how complex the build process is and how careful the maintainers have been about building the wheel. 
if it's that easy to copy then how will he sell it?
Yep. The most probable outcome is that there won't be neither need for py2ju transpiler nor the transpiler itself. But compiling Julia to Python modules would appear some day (nothing like that now). As well as easy installing Julia for Python (there are still some problems there).
Oh cool! What type of roguelike are you making?
You're killing it!
Forgive me for not understanding the CPython internals well, but couldn't it check the refcount of the result of d1 + d2 to see that there are no other references to it when adding d3, and take the "fast path" of doing an update instead of copy-then-update?

He want, that was my point.
People don't buy software. People buy **service** for software. Why would a business pay Microsoft hundreds of dollars for every workstation that runs windows instead of running Linux for free? Because if something goes wrong they can call Microsoft for help. why would someone pay an anonymous internet person for a command line tool? Unless the tool does something absolutely remarkable and unique, they won't. the main reason is, If the tool stops working then they get no help. If you really want to make money selling software, you need to service and maintain that software. The money is in the service. 
Yeah I'm trying to turn them into a Networkx Graph, but I'm having a hard time figuring out what in the GeoDataframe is supposed to represent the streets (going by the assumption that the points in the Geometry attribute are the intersections).
Ah! no need for machines to learn how to build machines, it's easier to teach them how to vote for themselves.

Guys, It's going to be $1-$2 piece of software. It cannot be difiicult to copy
Is there really a market? I've never found a piece of windows software that I'd pay for that isn't a game.
I'm writing a blog/static site generator using mostly [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [cmarkgfm](https://pypi.org/project/cmarkgfm), inspired by [Thea Flowers blog](https://blog.thea.codes/). The aim is to design a blogging website that is easy enough for my wife to use, while still being customizable enough for use by everyone. For my own blog, I need code blocks. cmarkgfm supports them, but doesn't handle syntax highlighting. To handle that, I have a few options; [Pygments](http://pygments.org/), [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/), [Chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma), or [Syntect](https://github.com/trishume/syntect) (and probably a few more that I am unfamiliar with). I'd really like to use Syntect as it's insanely fast, lets me cache grammars that are used frequently (such as Markdown and Python), and it supports most if not all grammars that Sublime Text supports. However, I would have to write a binding for it and that will take a while. So unfortunately, in the interest of time, that leaves me with 2-3 options; Pygments, highlight.js, or Chroma. I haven't looked at Chroma enough yet to even know where to begin with using it, so I'm leaning towards Pygments. I'll probably use Pygments to start with as I have experience with it, though its not my first choice. After syntax highlighting is handled, I'd also like a way to easily customize the design and layout of the site such that someone with little to no experience with web design can easily do it themselves. Same thing for writing and editing posts, I'd like that process to be streamlined as well. I'm a bit on the fence about whether or not I should support themes, like Jekyll themes. It's been suggested to me, but I see a few potential significant headaches attached to idea. I'd much rather configuration be made specifically for my application, rather than trying to shim Jekyll themes for my blog. I'd like to keep everything as small as possible, while still being responsive, so as few external sources (such as scripts for analytics, bootstrap, etc.) as possible should be used. To address analytics and whatnot, I'd like to roll my own solution (only other "good" option is Google Analytics *shudders*) Deployment should be **super** easy because I'm already targeting non-programmers, making it hard to start would do me no good. Which leads me into managed SSL certficates via [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), managed Nginx/Apache configs (mostly Nginx, though), etc. Big ideas, and it's shaping up to be a *really* fun project. Only thing I really struggle with is web design, and that's half the work. I'll be sure to make a post here about it (including the source code) as I'd imagine something like this could be pretty helpful for both new and old developers that are interested in starting their own blog.
When I tried and I followd the manual it gave me "[arn11s04-in-f14.1e100.net](https://arn11s04-in-f14.1e100.net)." from "[216.58.207.206](https://216.58.207.206)"
No need to vLookup when pandas lets you filtered_data = dataframe[var1 &amp; var2 &amp; var3] for index, row in filtered_data.iterrows(): array.append(row['Whatever_you_want']) At least, that's how mine looks, but its part of a script to find a specific value in the excel based on 3 criterion. So, a faux-IndexMatchMatch
Does it need Vlookup?
&gt;nihilnia Thank you Adam
This is fighting the symptom, not the cause. I don't really care what the complicated solution to an overly complex, badly thought out situation (versioning and importing in python) is, I'd rather fix the underlying problem. Switching one solution that doesn't address the issue for a slightly better solution that doesn't address the issue is really a lot more effort than I'm willing to invest.
It has indexes and filters, it does not need vlookup
What's the difference between this and argparse?
Using requests to log into OBIEE to automatically run reports. From there, some of the data engineers can go grab the SQL logs for those reports...I hope. 
 import socket print(socket.gethostbyaddr("your ip here"))
Ansible... lots and lots of Ansible
I wouldn't make the assumption that the Point objects are intersections because sometimes lines in shape data can get broken up in weird places. If you're working with a specific dataset, it might be worth sending your question over to /r/gis, since the people there are much more likely to have the domain knowledge needed to address your issue.
Basically, just because google.com resolves into 216.58.207.206, doesn't mean that reverse look ups for 216.58.207.206 will resolve back to google.com. It all depends on how their admins configured their DNS servers. Reverse look up records (aka PTR) are separate from A/AAAA records. On my DNS server, I can make mydomain.eu resolve into 123.123.123.123, and reverse look ups for 123.123.123.123 can either resolve to nothing (no PTR record at all), or to myotherdomain.net, etc... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types#PTR So, reverse DNS is not suitable in your case.
More wikipedia processing. Should be a nice boring week
If you're only trying to track a couple users, listen to the network for transactions/blocks mentioning a given address and increment/decrement based on those events. You should only have to iterate the chain once, then create an index of information that you access frequently. 
(c) 2018? :)
This looks good!
Not my app? Just saying windows developers exist.
What does that have to do with anything?
There is no suggestion here to switch away from pip.
Noob question as someone who's been working a lot on Flask lately...Did you also do all the front-end/CSS stuff yourself? Your website looks really great. I'm starting to feel more confident with my python/Flask abilities but since I have 0 front-end skills making a good looking application seems super daunting to me.
wow! that must have been fun to build. =\]

Great work! I suggest to add Google auth. It may simplify registration part.
Should I store the incremented values in the database that also contains the user's login details, or does that defeat the purpose of my implementation of the blockchain?
I'm very new to Python but it recently helped me get my foot in the door to IT and my Dad needs help with his job. So these are both probably very simple tasks I'm trying to create a program that enters how many people apply for a job, out of the ones hired how many of them pass or fail the test. Then for it to store the information so they can come back to it later and to show a percentage of pass to fail rates. And I'm also writing one that automatically fills in the blanks on a template for a letter. 
What login details are you keeping? Also, no. 
This is awesome and very extensive. I think something that a lot of educational manuals lack is practice problems with validation. Free-code camp does a good job at solving this with their practice problems. If you could add this type of functionality to your book, it would add maximum value to the already great resource you’ve developed! 
Since I'm creating a wallet system, I'm creating a database that stores the user's (hashed) username, passwords, id, etc
This has almost nothing to do with data engineering
Argparser does command line options and does those very well. I just looked at Bullet and bullet does interactive prompts. It actually looks really nice and interesting. I just might use it for some terminal based interfaces.
Sounds like malware. What is your use case

Quick background on DNS forward and reverse lookups. &amp;#x200B; When you want to use the name to lookup the address, under the hood the DNS query is for a record of type A (for "address") indexed by name (the query name, or "QNAME"). The answer contains the IPv4 address in the record's resource data field (RDATA). $ dig +noall +ques +ans www.google.com a ;www.google.com. IN A www.google.com. 206 IN A 172.217.10.132 In the DNS it is impossible to query for the contents of the RDATA field\*. Therefore, in order to be able to lookup a name given an IP address (a "reverse" lookup), the computer is actually has to construct a special QNAME from the IP. The query is for a record of type PTR (for "pointer"), and if a record set with that name and type exists, it is totally independent from any A records for that IP. $ dig +noall +ques +ans -x 172.217.10.132 ;132.10.217.172.in-addr.arpa. IN PTR 132.10.217.172.in-addr.arpa. 86400 IN PTR lga34s16-in-f4.1e100.net. \*Instead, you have to have access to an auxiliary database built from so-called [passive DNS](https://www.farsightsecurity.com/technical/passive-dns/passive-dns-faq/#q11) observations.
I personally swear by `conda` these days, and only use `pip` for simple packages that aren't available on `conda`. `conda` does have a package dependency resolver, but it's been getting slower and slower over time. Likely because tree depth just keeps on growing.
Thank you! I will certainly add Google auth in the near future.
It was!

I did all the front end stuff myself, with the exception of the homepage, which I created by modifying some code from [here](https://cruip.com/).
Thank you, good catch! Fixed now :)
Thank you! I did most of the front-end stuff myself, and my skills are still developing in that realm :)

Try using a proxy to see your requests vs the browser's requests. I'd try [MITMProxy](https://mitmproxy.org/). This could help sort out any issues you're having.
Upwork May be the spot for you. It may be hard to get jobs without experience but I’ve started out with a pretty low wage and I’m trying to climb my way up now. Just apply for the real small jobs and build experience that way. I would suggest learning some java as it seems every posting wants at least some of it. I haven’t yet but maybe in the future. Lots to do and little time haha 
hey, im trying to do something similar with django. I have some questions * how long did it take you start to finish? * did you do it all by yourself? What parts did you do yourself vs what did you outsource? * How did you go about designing the site and coming up with a landing page? * what did you use for your database? 
I would suggest keeping that information separate. Just create a new `index.db` to store chain info
I think your best option would be using the [blender api](https://docs.blender.org/api/blender_python_api_2_77_0/info_overview.html)
The development took about 2.5 months, with development interspersed between other projects. I designed and built the entire site myself, but for the landing page, I tweaked the source code from startup homepage templates [here](https://cruip.com/). The design, features, and layout came out of some personal goals for the project, along with the feedback from very early beta testers. The database is simple SQLite, utilizing the sqlite3 module.
Interesting read on python internals. More content like this on r/python please!
I've had that question for such a long time now, just didn't ever got around to looking it up. Thanks for posting dude! 
Ahh yes, another post I will save and completely forget all about.
Excellent post, thanks
Consider setting up new environments as much as possible. You'll avoid fucking up and conda will stay fast.
"Chronos provides a clean hompage for each meeting with status (...)"
oh wow those templates are really useful. Thanks! this sounds very like what i'm doing, and a similar timeline for what i'm building (which is a different product though). 
Best advice for new people to Flask is to put it down before you build an app on it. It's not maintainable and you'll regret not having written your apps with Django.
Fascinating
It depends on what your app does, but Semantic UI is great for a quick, elegant front end. I built this in flask and semantic: https://dex.vidoardes.me/user/vidoardez The app isn't very interesting in view only but you can see how the filters work. The source is here: https://github.com/vidoardes/dex
Trying to get through my online crash course on python. So far its going great and I'm solving problems adequately. My code is still really bloated with logic and i havent quite figured out some sleeker methods for obtaining the same results. I did however find an easier and more compact form to one of the more difficult assignments in my course and I'm pretty proud of it. There is a long way to go in my course and am incredibly excited to see what my code will look like by the end. Im saving snippets of my code while I am learning to see what differences there are with my future code. 
For your second program, template engines like Jinja are very useful for stuff like this, but It's probably more than you need.
Yes I got that. A self-replicating program that overwrites any and all other python programs in a directory tree is malware imo
Thank you, I don't need to be running blender to use the API right, I can just import bpy and use it right?
As someone who’s very new and just looking for a framework to adapt a script into a simple webpage, would this also apply? Essentially, I’m only interested in learning, not in creating a large-scale project, and Django seems a bit much...

den wat
Interested in why you chose Flask over Django - personal preference? As someone who is getting into Python development and wanting to build websites, im unsure as to which one i should learn, Flask or Django.
OpenCV shipped with more than 2200+ algorithms. I don't know about pillow. But the important part about the support and large community behind it.
Hmm... I just got strange pictures that made me tingle.
urllib2
It looks bad on mobile :/
Update: Working version with GUI (and available in binary (.exe) format) [here.](https://github.com/PureAsbestos/Image-palettizer/blob/GUI-dev/README.md) It is still being polished a little, but will be merged with `master` soon.
Pillow is an image manipulation and processing library whereas OpenCV is for computer vision. There is some overlap, but you would use OpenCV if you wanted a program to be capable of parsing an image on its own (versus resizing or cropping in Pillow). OpenCV can be a bit complex so if regular image processing is all you need, it may be better to stick with Pillow.
then reeeeeeeinstall 
Sadly, yes. I am, however, working on a mobile version of the platform.
It's a promising idea, but I have yet to get it to do anything in the browser anyway, except upload an image. Changing the slider or clicking the buttons does nothing. At one point, there was a long delay, but then nothing happened again. I'm on Chrome, MacOS. 
I googled "positions" and "team" and "anal."
Started a project where I am trying to make a command line tool for finding information about Pokémon based on the Minecraft pixelmon mod. So far I have grabbed all the info off of the wiki and parsed it into manageable pieces. I have also designed the layout of the database I am going to use to store the information. I built a test db and started imputing information. Starting to run into problems managing all of my files and scripts. I need to find a better way to manage my files so that it can be easily understood.
I actually had the same problem, but managed to get past by adding —user after install. Try that?

Mostly personal preference. Flask really stays out of the way of the development itself, due to its minimal nature. Django, however, has more "out of the box" features (Flask has a number of smaller packages as well, but not nearly to the extent of Django). If you are looking to get started, I would recommend Flask to help you gain a better understanding of the overall structure of web apps, in a more flexible manner.
Small typo in first paragraph: "negotation". Looks good though! Are you planning on charging for the service? You might want to consider a pricing section on the homepage if you have that sorted. This is not essential obviously but it would be awesome to have a streamlined on-boarding process: the "get started" link could actually throw the user into the app without signing up, so they can try creating an event etc. Then, if they want to save what they've done - they need to create an account. Maybe it's not the "real" app, just some sandboxed environment that showcases the service and gives users a really good reason to sign up. 
Can someone explain the advantages of Django vs Flask? I've used flask once or twice and it seemed pretty straightforward and robust, and every time I look at Django it seems like this massive, intimidating, overengineered module. I'm sure there are reasons for both I just don't understand the use cases.
This is awesome! I’m trying to learn flask myself. Any tips ? And what resources did you use when you were learning? 
Thank you for pointing that out :) It is corrected now. I do plan on charging for certain tiers on the site (a fee per month to create a private meeting/event, etc), and would definitely mention these prices on the homepage. Thank you for the suggestion to create a "try it now" feature, I will certainly design something like it!
Check out BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Selenium. You might have to use Selenium if you can't do it via requests, but those are the tools that you can use to log into a website and do some automation. Once you have things downloaded, you could generate a dashboard using something in Jupyter notebooks, or just via some HTML - you could use Flask to serve your information and then one of the many Javascript charting libraries out there.
Yeah, i've been constantly hearing that Flask may be a better route when initially starting. I have experience doing front-end development work in HTML/CSS/JS and have recently started learning Python. I think i will go with Flask
Afraid I already do! Even in a fresh install, it's notably slower to resolve dependencies then it was, say, two years ago. One thing that I found helps is installing packages one or two at a time. It's tedious but it at least feels faster...
No, you don't need to have blender running, as far as i know.
IP ban or rate limiting? If you're rate limited, then obey their rate limits, just do something like ``` rate_limit = 100 requests_since_start = 0 for thing in things_to_request: requests_since_start += 1 request(thing) if requests_since_start &gt; (rate_limit - 10): time.sleep(100) # or however long to let things reset requests_since_start = 0 ``` That's a *super* naive way to do it, since it's not counting the actual request per time period, but that's a thing that you could do.
Do you have a repo with your sample code and test data? I'd like to take a look.
I really hate the idea of Google telling me who can or can't send me email. Using aiosmtpd I created my own email inbound and outbound server. I also love the command line and doing things in text vs Gmail's web composer. I wrote a tool that lets me compose my email in whatever text editor I want (vim) and then will take the text and render an HTML email from it and send the multipart email. I kind of like it a lot.

You're in luck. I just watch this a couple days ago and it explains the pros and cons of both. https://youtu.be/UY2JMZjQspY 
Flask is awesome. Great work!
Interesting article. Little feedback: I think it would be useful to put a link to part 1 in part 2 and vice versa.

Tried this—doesn't appear to to work. From the `ipdb&gt;` prompt, I'll type `b 42` (a line in function `foo()`) followed by `foo()` to call `foo()`, and the function will execute and return without stopping at that line.
Thank you very much! Flask is indeed very powerful!
Thanks! I suggest starting with the examples in the [documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/), then building a small app with different routes that you link to with hrefs in your templates. Then, you can progress with [sessions](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/flask/flask_sessions.htm), and start taking in user input to store in a simple database.
Thanks,I dont take that as rude its just being informative!
might want to generate that dynamically :D
Good thought! I will certainly do that.
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board.

Timeshift?
they solve different problems. django is more opinionated but more fully-featured and is designed for large database-driven apps with multiple tiers of users (regular vs. staff vs. admin, for example). flask is smaller and leaner and therefore inherently simpler. because its smaller, if you want to build out something more complex you have more of your own custom work to do. this is both a good and a bad thing. it's good in that you can make your choices specific to your problem domain and not have to deal with the framework developer's opinion on them. it's bad in that you end up having to re-implement solutions to problems that are already provided by a more opinionated framework. they have different kinds of learning curves associated with them. the django learning curve is mostly about learning django. the flask learning curve is mostly about learning how to integrate third-party components into a flask app. 
i like it. the design ain't mobile friendly, otherwise it's pretty good!
Sounds good thank you! 
I want to start a competition reward £40. AM I allowed? 
After watching about half of it (I don't have time to watch the rest at the moment), it seems like flask goes with a more modular, minimalist approach, following the pythonic mentality. On the other hand, Django went with a more out of the box, production ready, prepackaged design. Interesting. Thanks for the good watch!
thank you! it is really hard to design manually from 0 for me :D
How much of this is specified behavior of Python, and how much is internal implementation detail of CPython?
Agreed it can hang on 'solving environment' way longer than it used to

For my first Python project i'm automating filling forms using pyautogui and so far its working but whenever python opens up the form it scrolls all the way to the bottom of the page.
Crystal Clear tutorial ! I have been reading plenty of articles regarding Neural Networks claiming it is easy etc. But too few of them were this clear with 'from scratch' code plus completeness. Most of the articles hide behind packages that automatically optimize your network without telling what happens while this is where the real magic lies. You also put forward the math, this is necessary to fully grasp the mechanics behind training a network. Was long time since I worked with partial derivatives on paper (hopefully I end up with the same results !) Keep on going ! Looking forward reading your next articles ! 
`rm -r ./env`, `python3 -m venv env`, `source env/bin/activate`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`
I know this was already explained, but I’ll give it crack for people not wanting to watch a video. Flask is very minimal, sort of the bare bone components needed to get an API up and running. And that’s really where it’s key usecase is to me, running an API, it can do more, but that’s where it shines. Django, on the other hand, is really the full package. If you’re doing a full-stack website, it provides several of the layers. It’s really designed to be used with multiple moving pieces. If you’re doing something big and complex, with lots of user-facing elements, Django has a lot of tools for you. 
My experience with Django is limited, but what I can say is that it seems like it's much more fully-featured. If you know it well, you can very easily create things quickly, and I feel like that's the advantage. If you don't need all the features it supports, something like Flask is totally appropriate.
What is python?
Dude! Much thanks! I appreciate it, will help me A LOT!
you have some code that is not properly formatted/included in the example, see "import zmq from time import sleep" +1 for doing a real application. Far too many toy examples are available, nicely done.
Does it support CalDAV?
I used winpython (python without having to install it to the system) on my work computer and made a script to move the mouse a couple pixels every 30 seconds and toggle numlock to keep the computer from logging out. Can't change windows settings on the computer.
Currently no, however, I plan on implementing features to enable users to import their Google Calendars, etc.
Thank you! I am working on a more mobile friendly interface, and will update the forms shortly.
I have a script that scrapes a careers section on a company for a job I'm waiting to open up. It checks all pages of results(usually around 19 pages) and opens up each individual job page(like 120 total) to scan it for a specific keyword. Then it will notify my phone using the pushbullet API when its listed. It scans once an hour and about 6 seconds in between page so it's not constantly scanning.
Nice. 
You just inspired me to do something lol. Thanks. I have a script to show realtime submissions coming in from reddit in terminal. I'm gonna use a python package to open and show a new window to display every new image posted to reddit in real time. It will close an image and display the new image every time a new one is submitted. Thankfully there's a pre-existing way to filter out NSFW which I already have in my code lol. Don't need to see a bunch of guys junk.
I do security at the moment, so I used selenium to open up our security portal in chrome and automate my logs for the whole shift. It logs me in, goes to the logs page, clicks add log, and figures out the date info automatically and does all my activity lines(one for every hour) and then saves it. Whole thing takes like 10 seconds.
Personally I'd use beautifulsoup to scan the page for all image URL's and fetch them that way. If that's possible. Selenium avoids IG bot detection so there's that too.
The Django tutorial will take an hour to complete and teach you about Python along the way.
Oh also I made a python script that can automatically order me pizza through a pizza API. Dominos and Pizza Hut both have pizza API's. You can make it store your payment and house address info. Then I got to thinking, you can buy an arcade game button and hook it up to a raspberry pi and press the button to have it automatically order you pizza. Haven't made it yet but it's on my to do list.
Thanks. I'm trying to clear python advance topics now. This helps get updated tutorial
Flask is a URL router. It only forwards URLs to your view functions And you are responsible for everything else. Django is a full featured web framework with "batteries included". You have everything you need with Django including URL routing, database management, webpage templates, an auto-generated administration page, an authentication framework, a rest framework with self-generating documentation. Django has been being developed by massive foundation and corporations since 2004. Flask was made as an April Fool's Joke on April 1st, 2013.
What are you using to host the app? Is it just the built in Flask HTTP server or something more robust like Gunicorn?
Sounds like you can get more done well and faster by knowing Django rather than by knowing Flask.
Ty
Thanks. Though I know it, but reading again keeps me updated.
I also made [shrt.email](https://shrt.email) with Flask!
That's arguably true. On the other hand, getting good at Django is not a small time investment, and there's also a lot of cases where it's going to be totally overkill.
What do you mean adding --user?
Python decorator tutorial in 10 seconds: `x = d(x)` Same as `@d` `x` Where x is a function or a class
have you tried the Requests module? I've found it incredibly useful and easier for doing API calling

Great article! How are wheels handled during development? If I want to do 'jump to definition' for instance should I always prefer sdist's during development? Also, do you have any thoughts on how poetry might affect the landscape since it's bringing a resolver to the table?

What? You asked me what my app did. I said it's not my app. How is that not related to your exact question!?
Total Python noob here, but trying to handle my taxes with it, specifically my 1099s seeing as I dabbled with daytrading last year. &amp;#x200B; Scraped .txts from 1099 .pdfs and organized the data, figured out how to write it all to template .pdfs from the IRS site... only to realize I can't e-file directly with the IRS. &amp;#x200B; So now I'm looking at trying to write some code to interact with the FreeFillableForms site and upload all of my trades to multiple 8949s there. &amp;#x200B; ...thankfully everything else about my return is straightforward and I'll just do it manually... this will end up being a task in and of itself. Great learning opportunity though!
Interesting question. Module loaders and finders are part of [PEP 451](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0451/). However, having never used the other Python distributions, I'm not sure how well they conform to this.
Wtf. There are literally so many open source github projects to learn from. Book is shit in todays time. Even shitty YouTube videos are better nowadays. Just take any repository and pick code snippets &amp; try to make ur own tools. Tweak around &amp; you'll learn.
Why? There's already a ton of freely available information online and in open git repos.
How'd you learn the front-end? Also, how long did it take for you to make the project?

To develop the front end, I simply made many different mockups of my design, and chose the ones I liked the best. This project took about 2.5 months, with sporadic work between other endeavors.
Great tutorial! Could you explain more on how shifting the height and weight data makes it easier to use?
"At its most basic level, list comprehension is a syntactic construct for creating lists from existing lists." Well, that's at the most basic level. But of course you need an iterable for comprehension to work, it doesn't have to be a list. 
I presume you would have been able to ship it more quickly had you focused more? Also, any paying customers or lots of users yet? How are you marketing and selling your product?
Its a safe choice. I went from web to python too and when i started looking into doing flask or django i tried them both and personally for me flask was much easier to understand what was going on and get started with. I still plan to go back and learn django at some point but so far flask has worked so well i havn't needed to yet.
I like telling newcomers this. Learn Django if you want to learn how to make websites with Django. Learn Flask if you want to learn how to make websites. The skills are transferable. Django is great, but it also abstracts a lot of things away from the developer. This is good in a team, but if you know how to put the pieces together in flask, you'll better appreciate what Django does for you. And by then you won't need Django because you'll have several cookiecutter templates that do what you want it to do. Not to dissuade someone from learning both, of course. You should, if you want to. But learn what both offer and make the choice.
Thanks! Shifting the data (more or less centering it around 0) makes it train faster and avoids floating point stability issues. For example, think about f'(200) where f' is the derivative of the sigmoid function: f'(200) = f(200) \* (1 - f(200)) which will be some insanely small number because f(200) is 0.99999999..... Normalizing the data by centering it around 0 and/or making the standard deviation 1 is a somewhat common practice.
What resources did you use to learn Flask? I personally learn best through building a project 
Certainly, however, I am a university student, and my time is generally quite limited during the semesters :). I have yet to add payment tiers for certain features, as I have just released this first version of Chronos, and am attempting to grow the current user base. 
Awesome! Looks great so far. Thanks for your thoughts :)
Yeah, that's my point exactly, I don't think there's any operator that would be both consistent with the other, preexisting uses of it and free from implications that it does something it doesn't.
Thank you very much! This current version is just the start, I will greatly improve it shortly!
How did you use the HTML landing page templates? Like did you just repurpose them to your needs and Flask? FYI: I'm learning Django, which is somewhat similar.
den catch exception, throw computer, and try again.
How does it compare to [prompt_toolkit](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit)?
I googled a few "getting started with flask" articles and then scrolled through like three of them at the same time seeing how each one did each part and using them as a reference while i worked on making myself basic template. Then once i had an idea of what was going on i just kept adding to the template i got started and googling whenever id get stuck at a part. So i guess my resource was just googling and trial and error until i figured it out. The [Flask Quickstart Guide](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/) should be enough to get started in just a few minutes. The rest of the documentation there is very useful too. 
Really good. Been trying to get my foot in the door recently but struggled to find a tutorial that was easy to understand. This was really easy to follow, thanks for sharing!
thanks for the feedback, means a lot!
IDLE ain't exactly beautiful but it's made in Tkinter
Find out after the jump!
I used a template garnered from [cruip.com](https://cruip.com/) (the site has been up and down lately), and I kept the basic structure and most of the styling, put it in the /templates direction, and the css and js for the landing page template in the /static/styles folder, and then just pointed to it using flask.render\_template.
Good project. I have glanced through parts of it, but what I see is `_run_appscript()` function in the code checks for return code, stderr, stdout. That's a good coding practice. I had something like that for running code on Linux. However, in this particular script I don't see the application caring about the `stdout` or `stderr`, nor checking the exit status. I think it would be simpler for this particular script to just use `subprocess.call()` or `subprocess.check_output()`, depending on what's important - exit status or stderr for `osascript`
Remembering when I had almost no web development experience and little JavaScript knowledge, I wish people hadn’t told me “don’t bother learning a framework before you learn web development using only JS, HTML and CSS”. Learning how the very opinionated Django framework structures a website was massive for my understanding of web development. I really like how logically structured it is because it separates the different parts (Model Template View) so that the different areas that must be in sync when working on websites or webapps (data/backend devs, business logic/client, design/user experience) has a place.
Kind of like waaaaaaat?
Really a good tutorial. Looking forward to more tutorials from you: D
Check out /r/learnpython
I read this as Implementing a Neural Network in Scratch at first and that’s something I wanna see. 
Will do!
looks so fucking good, i wish i had the skills to do that . i know some simulations are really heavy to process , maybe you should convert the heavy parts to C or C++ so it can run faster than native python (like a future proyect)
I wrote a command line tool that downloads historical FX trading data, and another tool that can populate a Postgres database with the same. Includes a hashing function to ensure you don't load the database with the same file twice ( even if the filename is different ). It's my first 'real' program, so I was pretty happy with it: [truefx-downloader](https://github.com/Sebastiaan76/truefx-downloader)
Yes, pip download will build the package, and in order to do so it will install any build dependencies.
Personally I use PyCharm and mark the root directory of the source files (usually src/) as "source root", which it handles gracefully. I like poetry, but whether it's resolver will make it into pip is an open question. And pip is not going away as the default way to install packages.
&gt; OpenCV can be a bit complex so if regular image processing is all you need, it may be better to stick with Pillow. This^ My first big job after undergrad was in computer vision and most of my ramp up time was spent learning OpenCV. She’s a beautiful beast but goddamn is it a massive library.

Your blog and communication skills are amazing. Do you do web programming? Or is it something you picked up for this blog specifically? If so, where?
Hey I like your python channel too :)
I like pip-tools.
Thanks! I do a lot of web development - if you check out my homepage [https://victorzhou.com](https://victorzhou.com) you'll see that I blog about web development too: &gt;I blog about [web development](https://victorzhou.com/tag/web-development), [machine learning](https://victorzhou.com/tag/machine-learning), [programming](https://victorzhou.com/tag/programming), and [more](https://victorzhou.com/tags). &amp;#x200B;
Awesome post and blog!! Definitely subscribing 
I recommend [You read this book.](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) It's Free, and From 4 lesson it gives a programme to make By yourself to do a particular task As a homework &amp;#x200B; and again, *if You need any help learning python ask me*
I knew I'd find you here. Interesting choice or syntax. Readability always matters. :) we as Pythonistas are getting spoiled with these goodies.

Oh, I misunderstood your comment. "optimizes it into a loop" suggested something like this to me: result = {} for dct in (d1, d2, d3, d4): result.update(dct) I haven't poked much at the implementation of CPython either, but that sounds reasonable as long as weakrefs are tracked too.
what if there are multiple inputs and buttons.. how pywinauto handles that? Thanks
thanks subscribed!
Thanks mate
So I would want to learn flask if I purely want to do a blog and/or some simple ui? I don't want a career at all in web programming. I have one. I just want a blog to put up cool projects and stuff, especially if widgets and such can be implemented.
 OP you should definitely do it. Post the project link so I can take a look, maybe even participate when possible. ** maybe op can benefit from the non-constructive comments and think about how this book will be different from all the noise currently available online. Possibly document it as tech writing design goals. There are a ton of books about everything you could possibly think of. That is not an objective valid reason not to write a new book. If your not interested, move along. Putting someone else down, and discouraging someone is not very constructive. Personally I cannot commit to such a project. But it has a lot potential. 
Thanks for looking at my code! For some reason I thought only Popen could handle stdin piping, but thanks to your suggestion, I changed from Popen to run(check=True,...), which is equivalent to check\_output(): [https://github.com/kylepw/wikiwall/blob/master/wikiwall.py#L218](https://github.com/kylepw/wikiwall/blob/master/wikiwall.py#L218) &amp;#x200B; And yeah, if you'd like to contribute, throw me a PR anytime!

If all you want to do is make a blog, I would recommend just using WordPress or SquareSpace. Can’t say I’d recommend reinventing the wheel there. Gun to my head, though, I think I’d prefer Django for making a blog.
Great!
I'm terrified of mixing * yum / apt install &lt;python-package-x&gt; * pip install &lt;python-package-y&gt; I'm afraid that the two package managers won't play nice together. Is my fear (un)founded?
Why didnt you list the cons? * It does not save the most vertical space. You can move all args one line up. * If you want to add an argument, you also have to move the `):` * Horizontally, you indent way more, and in my opinion that makes it even worse to read if you are already some indentation levels deep.

Your fear is completely founded--there is often a yum/apt package which will install some python package(s), but these do not always play nicely with packages installed via pip. You should always use a virtualenv when installing python packages, which means you won't run `pip install` as root and so you won't be able to make this mistake.
Sharepoint (at least used to) expose a SOAP API over which you would be able to do something like that. I've consumed Sharepoint lists this way.

This package boasts some other features such as multiple choice lists, scroll lists, and etc. It also has extensive support for styling and formatting. You can also inherit an existing prompt class for more customization. You can take a look at the demo in the repo, or refer to the documentation. 
Flask is a URL router. It only forwards URLs to your view functions And you are responsible for everything else. Django is a full featured web framework with "batteries included". You have everything you need with Django including URL routing, database management, webpage templates, an auto-generated administration page, an authentication framework, a rest framework with self-generating documentation. Django has been being developed by massive foundation and corporations since 2004. Flask was made as an April Fool's Joke on April 1st, 2013.
flask_oauth module makes this real easy to implement
I'm not saying Django isn't good enough. I'm just saying the sort of people who favour flask are not looking for batteries included. Sometimes you want to customize things. Flask shines there.
I switched from `argparse` to `click` for my latest project, but this looks really clean. Can you bypass the interactivity? I.e. If I want my user to select a fruit like in the example, is there a way to run `foo --fruit=apple`? 
Have a look [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/axw1vy/balance_a_fantasy_rlrpg_with_a_focus_on_world/) :) &amp;#x200B;
Or not have it at all, it doesn't mean anything. 
Pip install —user Numpy , like that
"Customize" you mean dependency hell when have your dependencies and your dependencies' dependencies don't get updates when the amateurs maintaining it get bored, and then you have to try to "customize" your dependency requirements list so that you *only* have to worry about the endless deprecation warnings coming from maintained apps instead of the more likely scenario that your app just stops working? No thanks, I appreciate having the Django Foundation handle all that for me and then kindly maintain extensive and up-to-date documentation helping me get things done right and fast.
when I learned BeautifulSoup I found that these basic tutorials are only bringing you as far as finishing the tutorial. The real task comes when you try getting the data you actually want while getting around javascript or website access limitations or using onpage navigations like product searches etc.. But yeah, your explaination looks good.
Not that, the fact that Windows developers exist. 
I understand your question, but since I figured argparse already handles these one-liners quite well, my initial aim was to build an interactive prompt package. What exactly do you hope to add to this package (non-argparse features) ? 
Interesting. Keep us posted with how it goes!
Thanks for the feedback!
I'm using a Raspberry pi with a camera and motion sensor. When it detects movement it records a short clip and stores it in a database. Then you can login to a Django based web app and watch the clip. If it works well I'll try and use image analysis to determine if the movement was caused by a cat or a person. 
It's heresy
Great work

I do understand where you're coming from. I can see why having a foundation behind it monitor PRs is a good thing. I'm happy with flask but if I see a need for Django, I will use it again some day. For the foreseeable future though, flask suits my needs more than adequately.

Bluetooth... As in Classic Bluetooth not Bluetooth Low Energy? You can have it occupy a Com port and send serial data through it like a USB Port. Bluetooth LE is a whole different story, completely different methodology and setup. 
Django is the Symfony of Python. It is extremely opinionated and it wants to get into your whole workflow: authentication, database access, database migrations and setup, etc. Flask is simpler. It allows you to have a simple app or, if you need, you can add a lot of functionality on top using extensions, blueprints, etc. There is one more advantage of it. The next gen frameworks which use async, like Sanic have exactly the same semantics as Flask. Moving from one to the other is immediate.

I'm not a fan, here's why: I think a closing brace/bracket/parenthesis/etc stands out more when it gets its own line, and it's important that they stand out because they tell you what context the code is currently in (i.e. partitioning lists/arguments/function bodies from each other). Knowing what context each bit of code is in is crucial to understanding how a program works.

I can't believe how much grief the author received because he uses uvloop and hiredis for speedups. What's wrong with it? If he used msgpack, are we to claim it's unfair because the msgpack Python module is written in C? What about the standard Python library, which contains lots of modules written in C, for speed? The mind boggles. This is the Python way: write 90% of the code in Python, but write the the 10% of code that is responsible for most of the slowdown in C. This is not unfair: in the end, most of the code you write is still pure Python, and the extension modules are typically written once and not touched anymore. &amp;#x200B; You have reach the same conclusion as me, the past few years. The implication for me was that I would rather make a small Python server that receives some data and stores it as normal Python object, in memory, then sends a reply (using aiohttp in my case), rather than the prior approach of (1) client process stores data in redis, (2) client process sends a pubsub notification, (3) server process listens to the pubsub notification, retrieves the data from redis and processes it. Also, keeping things in redis means that the server process needs to fetch from redis and deserialise the data every time it needs to do something with that data. Wheres if the object is already in memory then you don't pay any more the cost of fetching and deserialising data, it's already a Python object, will probably be just a simple dict lookup. &amp;#x200B; Yes, redis is plenty fast, but sometimes doing things in a simple Python client/server architecture allows you to actually be faster in the end, because you have fewer network round-trips and deserialisation and, consequently, lower tail latency. &amp;#x200B; The point being that your benchmark demonstrates that, if you can achieve 60% of performance with Python, then maybe you can do this sort of client/server design optimisations, and in the end achieve better overall performance, while keeping most of the code in pure Python.

Alas, this is not entirely correct. The GC runs every N object allocations. When it runs, it has to visit the entire object graph, just to check things, even if in the end there are no object reference cycles to free. This I have observed (thanks to monitoring via Prometheus python client, which under Python 3 reports lots of GC metrics, I just added \``len(gc.get_objects())`\` as another metric: 1. The more frequent object allocations are, the more frequently GC will run; 2. The higher the total number of GC-aware (container objects, things with dict, not numbers or strings) Python objects exist in your process, the longer GC takes to execute each run. I have observed that if you keep the total GC objects below \~ 150k, then the GC run takes less than 100ms; 3. And, of course, the whole Python process freezes while the GC runs: no asyncio coroutines run, not even Python threads, only C-level threads will survive.
Just FYI for readers getting into Flask: I have seen a number of questions about what to use for reference and where to start. I believe the [Mega Flask Tutorial ](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) is a awesome starting place!

Ah that's a shame. It'd be nice if it only kicked in once reference cycles happen and then only for the objects participating in the cycle.

Currently working on a discord bot. I've got it running on a raspberry pi so that it can be online all the time without having to leave my PC on. Currently it can give you the weather and your apex legends stats. Along with a leaderboard of all the people who have checked their stats using it. My current to do is to refactor the API calls to the apex legends tracker. And then add in similar functionality for other games we play. 
yep, I once had a page where for some reason all the tables were commented out when you inspected the page source code but it was sucessfully rendered in browser. So bf4 couldn´t find it, took me an eternity to figure this out and how to read the correct comment.

Congrats on getting a full project up and running with documentation, etc. But going forward you'll want to be able to answer "why do we need this wrapper for re and nltk?" At the moment, textcleaner doesn't seem to add much utility (this if coming from someone who uses nltk/re on a daily basis). Heck, some functions like `.lower_all()` are even more characters to type than the built in `.lower()` function that it wraps around.

Hmm ok worth trying thanks!
Because there is no single library for all platforms
Then answer this why is it that everyone always asks where to start? because there is to much out there, it's to chaotic
Thanks for the feedback! It's good to get some constructive feedback that I can use in my next videos.
SEO tools? I want to learn how to make SEO tools using python. Do you know any resources where I can learn?
I just tried this and got it to finally work!! eeeeee!!!!!

AAU :)
You can stick to regular functions. You can also ignore iterators, hell, you can also forget the += operator and list comprehension.... /sarcamOff Lambda expressions are a nice quick and lean way to define short functions in a (usually) readable manner. They become even moruseful when you want to program in a functional (look up functional programming fo more info) 
A udemy course from Jose Portilla called "Zero to Hero" where its a full crash course on python. I would say im like 1/3 through the duration of the course. I know there is a ton to learn in any programming language so im trying to decide if Lambda expressions should be something i try and actively introduce to new code.
Dude, i think You should be posting this on r/learnpython And, You Can Learn Python by video on youtube by TheNewBoston: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAcbMi1sH6oAMk4JHw91mC\_](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAcbMi1sH6oAMk4JHw91mC_) Also there is nice book for free i really like :[https://automatetheboringstuff.com/](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
Udemy online course by Jose Portilla. "From zero to hero in Python". So far its inredibly detailed and dense. Im like 1/3 of the way through and im already solving problems with functions.

Is there a reason you picked 135 and 66 as the numbers to subtract or did you just grab these arbitrarily? I understand why you would need to reduce the values but I didn't know if there was a method you used to get to those two numbers.
Interesting! Never thought this was possible
Cool, Thanks. I have started with some udemy course already which focuses in network programming with python. I will have a Look at that course afterwards, If i want to broaden my knowledge.
Haha awesome thanks!
nope it was arbitrary - i just wanted to keep the numbers nice looking. Normally you’d subtract the mean
Lots of websites populate information on them using public API calls, which you can look at, replicate, and modify. Sometimes these are locked down but often the sites either don't know or don't care as long as you throttle your requests to some extent. One example of a time when I did this was for a site which hosted esports event schedules. I noticed I could just tweak the parameters in the API call and filter the results by game, time, etc. So I set up a discord bot which called that API and got events within a certain time range whenever a user said !events. Pretty straightforward, only like 150 lines of code, but also surprisingly useful.
&gt;If you’re looking to get the source from sites relying on JavaScript (e.g. React frontends) you’ll need to use Selenium or some equivalent to fetch &amp; render. Not necessarily. If you can figure out exactly what server request the JavaScript is making by following the sequence of requests in DevTools, you can mimic it in `requests`. Sometimes these sites end up being even faster and easier to scrape than traditional sites (once you've put in the work to figure out how all the server requests work). A lot of the time these sites are returning an HTML page template, and then some JavaScript is executing a subsequent request which returns the actual data as JSON. If you can make your script mimic that subsequent server request you can now get straight at the data you need in nice, tidy, lightweight JSON instead of in a wall of HTML that has to be parsed.
Mee too 
If you find an answer to this please let me know. I am also looking for something similar. 
Exactly, I was going to put off down voting you but decided to get it done /s
Thanks
Right? Seems vindictive.
We need wrapper because you use re and nltk but you can't copy your code for cleaning on every machine, well you can but it takes time. I think you got the idea what I am doing here. Just saving a bit of time. Your welcome. Will try to name new functions responsibly. Thanks for your review. :)
You shouldn't take things personally, pico indent style isn't your identity is it. Your example in Python isn't how it would normally be written, with parameters in the function definition on newlines. Just use whatever is most employable. If everyone here is negative about it, just think how your boss and coworkers will feel. Other than that, do what you want. I don't think anyone here really cares what you do or like. If you like that do it.

If you are starting (and try to do anything more complicated than really simple site) I'll recommend to go with Django. Reasons: \- lot's of tutorials \- awesome doc's \- battery included - most of the things you may need are already in the package (in flask you either will need to know what you are doing or will be wasting time with researching proper module that solves your problem) \- opinionated - meaning there are established ways of doing things (once again, if you are starting this is a feature - you don't waste time and brainjuice researching what's the best way for solving something
Lambdas are useful when they're useful. Insightful, I know. Probably the #1 place they get used in Python is for the \`key\` parameter of \`list.sort\`. Say you have a list full of these \`Person\`s. &amp;#x200B; \`\`\`python class Person(NamedTuple): first: str last: str \`\`\` &amp;#x200B; How do you sort the list by last name? &amp;#x200B; \`\`\`python people\_list.sort(key=lambda x: x.last) \`\`\` &amp;#x200B; However, some people have a tendency to overuse lambdas. Just because you \_can\_ doesn't mean you \_should\_! Lambdas are limited and hard to document. Err on the side of regular ole' named functions.
I find the easiest way to do this is to take a picture of the text, write what you see down on a piece of paper, fire up IDLE, then assign what you transcribed to paper into a python variable. Then just print it.

Spark is such an overloaded term in software engineering. * [apache pyspark](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/) * [Spark java](http://sparkjava.com/) * [robinhood spark](https://github.com/robinhood/spark) * this I'm sure there's more.

In general: very useful, especially if you program in a style that makes heavy use of higher-order functions (that is, functions that take functions as arguments and/or return functions). In such a style, you often find yourself writing lots of tiny single-purpose functions that aren't important or complex enough to be named and pulled out into a full blown statement. Lambdas are also super useful with functional programming techniques like partial application (supplying only some of the required function arguments, to return a new function that takes the remaining arguments). In Python, lambdas are a bit crippled, and the aforementioned techniques are a bit awkward at times - but they're still worth knowing about, and if used tastefully, can make code much clearer sometimes.

Congratulations, you made me finally give up and unsubscribe from /r/Python. Cheers, mate. 
Im not taking it seriously at all! Ive switched from allman, to k&amp;r and now i find this more readable. There are cases when either you've indented too much or you have a lot of function arguments, and you need to place some on new lines. Plus there is also assigning variables to long lists. If you wanted to do the allman method, you'd have to escape the enter key, and K&amp;R leaves dangling closing brackets. The reason i say im really going to use it is because so far, ive found no cons that actually hold water, and everyone else is voting me down because of things like &gt; Its heresy and &gt; It looks like crap None of which are actually decent reasons *not* to use it The pico method uses the indentation of the block to show the scope and control flow, just as python does. it also saves the most vertical spaces without having awkward hanging closing braces on a sole line. Ive come to my decision by logic, not because my indentation style was my identity. hell, i just changed to this method last night! 
I've been getting into math and computer science in my 30s. I'm also really into genetics and genomics so I've been doing problems on rosalind.info to learn python and finding them really enjoyable. Anyone else use that site to learn PY? How has your experience been?
You're welcome lad.
so a company who implement an engine which cannot render css properly (as the standard describe it) release a python module ? ohh and one more thing, the pep8 is not the hardest readings in the world (I think), but this snippet of code is give me a lot of answer "def streamToPowerBI" really well named python function :D
Note that map() and filter(), and the use of lambda's in them, have become less important since the existence of list comprehensions and generator expressions. seq = [1, 6, 8, 4, 15, 2, 7] # Filter even_numbers = filter(lambda n: n % 2 == 0, seq) # Generator expression even_numbers = (n for n in seq if n % 2 == 0) # Map squares = map(lambda n: n**2, seq) # Generator expression squares = (n**2 for n in seq) # Map + filter even_squares = filter(lambda n: n % 2 == 0, map(lambda n: n**2, seq)) # Generator expression squares = (n**2 for n in seq if n**2 % 2 == 0) # Bit awkward because n**2 appears twice That's not to say that you should stay away from map() and filter() and lambda's. Just remember that sometimes there are other options that are just as clear, or sometimes clearer.
haha very true, this refers to the same Spark as the first link.
Don't worry, we don't work with those browser guys. And for the python methods we follow Spark's Python notations over pep8... It keeps the method names the same for Java, Scala, Python and R (and makes Python developers eyes bleed)
Spark is an ecosystem with components in Scala/ Java/ R and Python. This naming convention follows the remainder of the Spark and PySpark ecosystem See this except from PySparkML docs: https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.mllib.html#module-pyspark.mllib.linalg This project aims to be as compatible with the whole of the SparkML ecosystem as possible, so you will have to yell at them for that choice!
Trying to decipher an ancient API to control a piece of software which controls a piece of lab equipment. The problem is the equipment and API are both discontinued and I am relying on using the API documentation bundled in with the only example of code using it I can find. The equipment is expensive and seems to be built with the same mindset as python regarding assuming the user is a reasonable consenting adult and therefore has very little by the way of protective hardware/API features. Final issue the equipment is in fairly constant use 10-5 every week day so I don't even get much time to practice and try and figure out what is going on either. The alternative to this is sitting for 7 hour stints pressing the same series of buttons and changing filenames. I have actually debated if it would be easier to avoid the API altogether and just to find some form of auto clicker and just automate the saving to a temporary filename and write a small script to copy and rename this file. 
Ok, tl;dr PEP8 and PEP20 In python is nearly the same as the 42 in the universe

Your best bet with Python is to use the graph API: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/sharepoint?view=graph-rest-1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/sharepoint?view=graph-rest-1.0) &amp;#x200B; Otherwise, accessing Sharepoint is best done using a .NET language so that you can take advantage of some of the other tools.

(for interested readers) If you want to take this one step further, faster, and a little closer to how mathematicians treat neural networks, you abandon the idea of a node, and treat all the nodes in a layer as a single array. This enables you to use faster linear algebra. self.w1 * x[0] + self.w2 * x[1] + self.b1 Becomes W.dot(x) + b Where W, b and x are arrays of the values [w1, w2,... ] at that layer. The dot product, above, is simply the same multiply and sum equation as above, but it's faster because it's numpy. If you substitute these layers into the original article instead od nodes, you've got something that looks exactly like how PyTorch really looks. 
are you one of those spammers? 
see? my point exactly. you could have answered this question for yourself very easily by looking at my reddit profile, but instead you asked a stupid question. #millenials

Very good video, thank you
I'm not able to compare perl's and python's text parsing abilities, so i'll skip on this one. Regarding the GUI, Python includes Tkinter, that allows to build simple (and not so simple) GUIs easily. Tkinter is included in the default windows' python distribution, so no need to install other modules beside basic python.

Ok sorry I thought this would be the main place but I didn't read the description
Could you specify what you mean with "windows interface"? If it is a graphical UI you mean, what platform do you want it to run on? (Windows/Mac/Linux ...) Also, what kind of parsing is it you want to do?
!remindme 2 days
You can do it with PySide2. Also, it depends of what those forms are, pdf files? websites? html? docx? But pretty much anything like that can be done.
Awesome, thank you for letting me know. All these files are PDF as when i came i decided it was better to standardize it instead of having here some excel files or there some Word docs. Have you tried yourself? if so do you have any guide i can use to start this coding? Thank you.
I've been trying to create a bmi calculator in python, however everything seems to work except the formula which has previously worked before hand. Does anyone know what the problem is ? Thanks the original code is below. &amp;#x200B; name = input("What is your name?") weight\_kg = input("What is your weight in KG's?") height\_m = input("What is your height in M's?") &amp;#x200B; bmi = weight\_kg / (height\_m \* height\_m) print("Your bmi is: ") print(bmi) &amp;#x200B; if bmi &lt; 25: print(name) print(" is underweight.") else: print(name) print(" is overweight.")
Looks like you are trying to do a math operation with a string. If you give a keyboard input, the input is a string, so you must convert it to int, so that the multiplication should work.
Get user input in an int() userInput = int(input())
all you need to do is this: int(string_to_convert) 
Exactly
Awesome! Thanks for sharing!!
C or c++ if speed is a concern. 
Windows GUI. Platform = Windows (10). Parsing is just taking a line of tab-delimited text from an input file and turning it into a different format/order and saving that format to an output file. e.g. Start time, end time, text into Text, Start time, end time &amp;#x200B; basically
Speed is no concern
Thanks for your answer. I allready tried with absolute path but in doubt I tried again with this : file = open(os.path.abspath("C:/users/maxime/desktop/testfile.txt")) and i got this, again : Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;pyshell#5&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; file = open(os.path.abspath("C:/users/maxime/desktop/testfile.txt")) FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'C:\\users\\maxime\\desktop\\testfile.txt' I also tried with Pathlib to get the absolute path in another way but same situation.
You're still not being clear about what you mean by "Windows GUI". Python can do that easily. I'd imagine that it'd be a cinch in any programming language in common use.
Huh - seems interesting.
Well the text processing seems simple enough. The GUI part is probably gonna be the biggest part of your project. Perl seems to have bindings for Qt but it seems a bit outdated to me. Python has [PyQt](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt). Qt gives you a very "native" and is cross-platform. &amp;#x200B; I'd personally choose Python over Perl for this, but if you're willing to branch out, I would suggest you have a look at .NET which plays really well with GUIs in Windows: [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/desktop](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/desktop)
Educated guess: any CPython-compatible code which doesn't use C extensions should work fine under Jython assuming Jython is spec-compliant. Any CPython code which has C extensions will break under Jython. This includes things like Numpy, Tensorflow, and a few other performance-oriented libraries. Conversely, any Jython code that calls out to the JRE will most likely not work under CPython.

Windows GUI means when the program is invoked a GUI pops up, on the left hand side there is a load-file button which opens a file of your choice using the file dialog box, and then once opened it is processed and an output file is saved. Then a pop up comes up saying, "success" or failure if the file is not deemed to be valid.
thanks , would you recommend using Tkinter or PyQt ? I ts just going to be a windows app, not linux or windows. I guess in terms of ease of use/complexity they are both similar.
Use `float()` instead of `int()` if you are expecting decimals.
Because any decent template engine will be way faster for the usual use cases, and rendering speed actually matters for some people. Also, this is not really any easier to write or more readable than html in a template.

For something very simple I would recommend you take a look at [appjar](http://appjar.info/) for the GUI
Because unless you plan on being the only developer of the project it will be easier to allow your most certainly better ui designer to focus on its html while you made sure such html does what it is intended... 
I think Jython is quite far behind CPython version-wise, I think Jython only targets 2.6 or maybe 2.7, so anything using new, Python3 features will not work. Jython obviously won't run C extensions, but it can call the JRE. Other than that, Jython is very close to CPython and is a fully compliant Python interpreter. There are some performance differences, for example Jython uses the Java garbage collector, so open files aren't closed until the process exits unless you explicitly close them yourself using `file.close()` or a `with` statement. Jython uses a compacting garbage collector, so objects can move in memory, Consequently, code which abuses `id` by pretending it returns a memory address (it doesn't, it returns an abstract ID number) will break in Jython, since object IDs are sequential integers 1, 2, 3, ... There is [a page on the Jython site that documented the differences between implementations](https://www.jython.org/archive/21/docs/differences.html), but it hasn't been maintained for many versions and many of the things have changed. Otherwise, Python code that doesn't use implementation-specific features should run fine on Jython. 
You could do two windows side by side with any videos and jupyter
I love your energy. 
.Net would probably be easiest, just because that's the easiest to make a such a GUI in. The rest of the problem is dead-simple - the GUI and making a distributable installer/exe is the only difficult part of the problem.
Nice ones, thanks!
And this is why I hate dynamic typing. Not that I don't understand it, but for the single reason that people new to programming will remain largely ignorant of *typing* until stuff like this happens, then comes running to stackoverflow or reddit for help. Granted, if people weren't so reluctant to pick up a book and actually read a bit about what they're working with, we wouldn't have this problem either.
While I love the idea of interactive prompts, most of the time software I write is called is _non-interactively_. I just think it'd be really cool to have interactive prompts for users directly running the software and a way to provide arguments when called non-interactively, i.e. by a script, batch system, etc. That way you'd have the best of both worlds!
Looks good! Clear use case, nicely-written code, thanks for sharing! &gt; convert images of tabulated data to tabulated data Good luck! This can be *tricky*. &gt; I'm open to your suggestions and critiques. Just some really minor things - `Path("whatever").is_file()` already checks for whether it exists, so you don't need a second check - I'd recommend instantiating a logger (`logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`) so that if someone wanted to incorporate this into another project, you know where the messages are coming from - On a similar note, you may as well just instantiate your `data` list inside the function and then `return` it - mutating globals is rarely the right choice - `logging.basicConfig` needs to go in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block - To be a little safer, you could use `name.endswith(".png")` instead of checking for the substring somewhere in the name
I am by no means an expert but I've always been very impressed with the [Bottle SimpleTemplateEngine](https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/stpl.html). It is very lightweight (as is all of Bottle) and for my simple needs, it has worked well. I actually extended it for helping to parameterize complex computational simulations since it is pretty robust and easy to understand.
Even a modest amount of external requirements are going to balloon the size. Good tips though, upvoted.
I usually go with python when the subject is interoperability, heck, I usually go with python for any automation task. It does what you want, but it’s way way more than what you want. Its endless supply of libraries is what makes it shine. At the end of the day though, go with what you’re comfortable with !
That's true, but i guess there is no way around that. Thanks for the upvote, people seems to be downvoting, but no idea why.
TL;DR: Poetry is faster for common dependency management tasks, except for an initial installation (\`poetry install\` v \`pipenv install --dev\`). Poetry v1.0.0 should add a feature that addresses this, and it adds \`requirements.txt\` export support, which are the two areas where I felt Pipenv had the upper hand. I'd be curious to hear from other people who have used both to see if your experiences lined up with mine.
looks like a stripped-down [Mako](https://www.makotemplates.org) which is what Reddit actually runs on.
I'd create the GUI with PySide2 ([Qt for python](https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python)), then use the [reportlab](https://www.reportlab.com/docs/reportlab-userguide.pdf) library to deal with PDFs. First just create the GUI in qt designer, then export it to python with pyside2-uic, then code the logic of your gui and add the PDF part on that logic. Then test it and if you want you can use pyinstaller or fbs to make it a .exe file.
&gt; uplevel &gt; matplotlib ...if matplotlib is a step up, how were you visualizing your data in python before?
:) you have to start somewhere! 🤷🏼‍♀️
Congrats ;)
Message me as well please!
Awesome. Thank you for the info, I will give a try, hope I can get it working 
try... pythonanywhere.com
I've looked at them before, My script uses firefox (geckodriver/selenium) and needs to open/close windows in order to get its info. Correct me if I'm wrong, but [pythonanywhere.com](https://pythonanywhere.com/) doesn't support that
Why not pip?
Edited! Thanks a lot. &gt; `Path("whatever").is_file()` already checks for whether it exists, so you don't need a second check Yeah, why didn't I think of this? If the file doesn't exist, it won't work. Fixed. &gt; I'd recommend instantiating a logger (`logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`) so that if someone wanted to incorporate this into another project, you know where the messages are coming from Good idea. I'll fix it once I give a proper read to the logging documentation, since I just read it quickly and used the basic configuration for now. &gt; On a similar note, you may as well just instantiate your `data` list inside the function and then `return` it - mutating globals is rarely the right choice Fixed! &gt; `logging.basicConfig` needs to go in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block Well, what a dumball I am, I already knew this. Fixed. &gt; To be a little safer, you could use `name.endswith(".png")` instead of checking for the substring somewhere in the name Done. I didn't know about this method at all. I guess I need to study the standard library all over again. Extra thought: * Is the creation of a temporary directory even necessary? I decided I'd do it, but now that I've looked at the code and used the script several times, the creation of temporary files are there just to increase the size of my script and to create unnecessary files.
I wrote a 106 character matrix multiplication script. It's intentionally short and hard to understand because I was golfing. I'd really like to get it under 100 characters if possible. [Check it out](https://github.com/0x424D/messy/blob/master/cg_mmult/src/main.py)
Pygame
&gt; Is the creation of a temporary directory even necessary? I don't think it is - you can use the `path` argument to `my_zipfile.extract()` to output the file directly from the docx to the target directory. A couple more things: - try to avoid using `file` as a variable name - it clashes with the name of a built-in - rather than re-instantiating a new Zipfile for every operation, you can just open it once using a `with` block. That'll probably save some time and it'll make sure it gets tidied up afterwards. - you could unzip all the files you want in one go ```python from zipfile import ZipFile IMAGE_EXT = ('png', 'jpeg', 'jpg') src_file = "path/to/whatever.zip" tgt_dir = "path/to/somewhere/else" def is_image(filename): return any(filename.endswith(ext) for ext in IMAGE_EXT) with Zipfile(src_file) as my_zipfile: image_names = [name for name in my_zipfile.namelist() if is_image(name)] my_zipfile.extractall(tgt_dir, image_names) ```
The last half of the post, particularly the section pointing out that for sublist in nested_lists: for element in sublist: element is equivalent to [element for sublist in nested_list for element in sublist] by merely taking the desired result `element`, putting that in front, and then concatenating the for loops in their original order.

Ah i'm an idiot i'm sorry.
yes you are correct. I worked around it by populating the PA database remotely. an easy option is subscribing to a paid cloud service, aws, digital ocean and run all those in one go.

This is the approach Haskell dev’s usually take. Although Haskell has the advantage of being a much more expressive, flexible and performant language, making these EDSL’s much nicer. But take a look at Lucid, Blaze, Miso or Reflex for examples. 
Do you count whitespace as characters? Why make it unreadable?
Good luck! Hang in there!
We have GitHub enterprise at work, and so we have to train new users in git. To be honest, the thing that works the best to get people up and running is teaching just one command: `git clone`. From there we recommend people use the web interface for branching and PRs, and then we teach using a tool like VSCode for commits. This is the easiest path to a working setup. Once they get a little more advanced and have some experience, then we can introduce other commands like: - git push/pull - git add . - git status - git checkout -b - git stash Most tutorials out there move too fast and assume a lot of familiarity with the Terminal. I have yet to find an approach that works better for getting new users productive than what I outlined. 
The Pro Git book is a great resource, and available online for free at [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) . This will teach you all the ins and outs of using git. The nice thing about it is you can do all of that locally. Git doesn't require some remote repository set up. Having a remote can be helpful for having off-site backup and for collaboration with others, but it isn't actually necessary, especially if you just want to maintain version control over a personal project. The book does have a whole chapter devoted to GitHub though, so you'll have that part covered.
So are you a wayscript dev? Looks dope I'm definitely going to have to check it out tomorrow
Of course whitespace are characters. They mean something syntactically in Python. I might be less strict about whitespace in languages like C or JS though. 
Oh I thought you meant deep writing guide xd
Thank you for your answer 
I've also thought of implementing something like this and using [Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) to create an online dashboard to share with the team.
Sure, you can scrape APIs as well.

Pip requires 3 installations (a specific python distribution, pip itself, and then the app you want to distribute). Being able to generate a single standalone binary is useful in a variety of cases.

Plotnine is worth the learning curve; it’s more declarative and prettier, IMO. But I learned R before python, so I have a bias for ggplot. 
in this case it doesnt appear to matter the order, so you could just increment with a loop and do for pick in $options: print xPick then increment pas
Try printing the current working directory (cwd) from your script, before you attempt to open the file, and see if that matches your expectations.

Rewriting a program I wrote that analyses a couple of csv files and pushes out the analysis into a new xlsx file. It saves about 8 hours of work. My original version is un-reusable garbage, and I'm trying to reformat everything into classes so I can re-use the tools more freely. 
This really needs a design review though. Since I don't really understand what's this doing, all I can suggest is that you take the input param as a string and split them based on commas. num, y1, y2 = input().strip().split(',') Check if y1 and y2 are set to 'y' Pass them this function and check the value of num Instead of having separate X1, X2 vars, you can put them into a dict of type (num, value) and track the num to value mapping there.
Any advice on. How to handle login tokens for hidden API that require authentication? I have a special use case in mind and don't know how to handle the special put requests with the data I'm trying to push
I don’t know the rest of the code and hence I don’t know how to call the right variable, but what about: smart = pick.split(‘,’)[0] if int(smart) in range(3, 11): pas = pas + 1 If the X are stored in a list exes=[X3, X4, ....] you add print(exes[int(smart)]) before pas = pas + 1
r/learnpython 
Ok this helps a lot thanks. And I'm just kind of messing around and trying to learn.
Technically yes, but it is not worth it for this few string comparisons. When you have more comparison, you can use something call hash. You store all your responds in an array and your string hash is the index of your array. Not worth the effort when you only have 7 comparison. If you want it to be fast, you can run c code there with switch table, which is more efficient when interpreted to machine code. This is [how to do it](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-run-C-code-in-Python) 
Didn't know about Black, can't wait to try it tomorrow in the office. 
 exes = [X0, X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, X8, X9, X10] smart = pick.split(‘,', 1) if int(smart[0]) in range(3, 11) and smart[1] = 'y,y': print(exes[int(smart[0])]) pas = pas + 1 If you put the X variables in a list, this should work
This is amazing. Thanks!
Some other really useful tools for making and maintaining Python packages: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/ https://github.com/warner/python-versioneer 
This looks like a job for a simple dictionary to me. The keys are the “10,y,y” and the values are the thing you’re going to print. Like others have said, there’s probably way more to it for a correct design, but this is how I’d start.
You could create a dictionary. Use the outcome strings as keys, and the objects in the print statements as the values. For example: `pickdict = {"10,y,y": X10, "9,y,y": X9, "8,y,y": X8, ...}` &amp;#x200B; Then, just print the value from the dictionary using the `pick` as the key: `print(pickdict[pick])` &amp;#x200B; If the value of `pick` is `"10,y,y"`, the print statement will print the value stored in `X10` You will need to know the possible combinations of outcome strings and the X\* values you want to match up with each. This dictionary approach would avoid the lengthy run of if...else statements &amp;#x200B;
For basic authentication, you will need to create a requests session object. Maybe this will help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmf_y8zpOgA If you are using TokenAuthentication, you just need to generate it using login api and then pass it in header for every request.
Yes. This video has mentioned this webapp as a tip for generating python requests code from curl command.
Alright I'm gonna try that. Thank you
Come on Python community. Don't be a bunch of toxic asshats. This person is asking for help. ```python X5 = "IT WAS X5" pick_mapper = {"5,y,y": X5} pas = 0 def pick_it(item): global pas picked = pick_mapper.get(item) if picked is not None: print(picked) pas += 1 pick_it("5,y,y") pick_it("5,y,y") pick_it("5,y,y") print("pas after 3 calls is", pas) ``` 
Yep, solid suggestion. Dictionary is the way to go

Quoting pep8 here.... A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds A style guide is about consistency. Consistency with this style guide is important. Consistency within a project is more important. Consistency within one module or function is the most important. However, know when to be inconsistent -- sometimes style guide recommendations just aren't applicable. When in doubt, use your best judgment. Look at other examples and decide what looks best. And don't hesitate to ask!
This is a great write-up for a beginner. Thanks. 
Learning python is my project !!
How can I integrate tests in a pyqt5 application?
I ran those benchmarks so many times using slightly different `time` formatting and after wiping and recreating the virtual environments that they were bound to be cached. Thanks for sharing those pip-tools numbers. I hadn't used it before, although I have used a couple other jazzband libraries. It looks pretty speedy, too. It's interesting that it can generate a `requirements.txt` file from dependencies specified in [`setup.py`](https://setup.py). One of Poetry's goals, via [PEP 518](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/), is to be able to specify requirements in one place (`pyproject.toml`) instead of two (`setup.py` and `requirements.txt`). It looks like a great dependency management option for package maintainers who aren't ready to implement PEP 518.
This is the best solution IMO
I'm trying to get through the Pandas library cookbook - check out my progress on my sizlet here [https://sizlets.com/skillets/4150804e-57c3-452d-bd29-fbdd253cf398](https://sizlets.com/skillets/4150804e-57c3-452d-bd29-fbdd253cf398). It's kind of a dry book for me but I am powering through it because I love the in depth analysis I can do using the library. 
Been looking for something like this. Thanks!
You could look at Spyder if you want to see a super complicated example using PyQt widgets to implement an IDE with all the bells and whistles. There's also the QScintilla widget you can use to get a lot of Scite/Notepad++ features out of the box. I'm using it in a project. I also remember looking at qutepart and pyqode, but neither worked well for me for some reason.
I have a package for which I maintain requirements separately in a flit-generated `pyproject.toml` and the `requirements.{in,txt}` files with pip-tools. No tracked `setup.py`, though one is generated by flit during the package build. I figure the txt files are good for keeping things precise and up to date in the context of development, testing, deployments, git-checkouts, etc. while publishing to PyPI is really a different case, targeting the widest possible version ranges. (How) does the `pyproject.toml` spec or poetry handle alternative version specifications for PyPI?
Using a multi-stage build where you build wheels of the requirements and copy them into the next stage would let you install the dependencies that require build dependencies prior to the requirements.txt copy operation. That should further optimize build times without sacrificing space. A good reference for that: [https://www.merixstudio.com/blog/docker-multi-stage-builds-python-development/](https://www.merixstudio.com/blog/docker-multi-stage-builds-python-development/)
Thank you! I've never been happy with the crappy job I did rigging things together. Starting a new project with my kid and this will come in handy
Those of us who tried to use pathlib for everything on 3.4 for a few years before the pathlike protocol (or whatever it's called) got really tired of putting str() around every argument to every file related stdlib function. I don't think enough people are using sleep and timedeltas together for that to be a major pain point worth supporting.
You're not alone at least! Here's the very reasonable rejected patch request: https://bugs.python.org/issue5788 I wouldn't be shocked if it could make it in these days as opposed to 10 years ago.

Hint: you can get it shorter if you take the transpose and do the dot product &gt;!\[\[sum(m\*n for m,n in zip(i,j)) for j in zip(\*N)\] for i in M\]!&lt; Also, I don't think the input is typically part of the byte count

Why use Jython at all? Unless you were using it before, you can try Graalvm instead! It's pretty new and probably still evolving, but AFAIK it [can run Python](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/getting-started/#running-python) with ease. Graalvm is a polyglot JVM so you can interact with other JVM languages and the sort, bu I'm not experienced enough to say how.
Thanks, I really appreciate your help!
&gt;automating cool! didnt know about pyautogui, thanks!
ctypes doesn't really work.
Am looking to use/adapt a Java application for stock trading marketcetera.com which is able to run java &amp; ruby strategies. Application intended to run Python strategies using Jython, but later dropped the idea, probably due to lack of demand, as Python developers probably preferred command line Python apps. I am looking to use the infrastructure for managing strategies by non-programmer traders. But as our own skillset is Python based, looking to adapt this app, rather than code a parallel application, if possible.
It's so annoying At work the functional tests are on python 3.6 but the build scripts have to be on python 3.5. pathlib isn't great on 3.5 (no / operator) and no fstrings
I'd try, but I'm having trouble interpreting the question/problem.
Thanks for this. I knew that Travis existed but my package keeps failing. Now I know it's because I don't have any tests. Thanks for showing me how to get those made. Cant wait to get the Travis green light
Vineet, do your own homework
I'm not interested in an ide or an editor but in qt example applications. 
I was on 3.4 for a long time and I thought / worked for pathlib on 3.4 and it was just the better filename handling across stdlib that didn't come until 3.6. Maybe I'm remembering wrong. But, oh yeah - loving my f-strings for sure. Almost all of my old code has format() and it always looks way better with f strings.
Thank you! I learned a ton from this article and it was easy to read and well-organized. 
easy to learn and it has a lot of data science packages, making it ideal for machine learning experts that want to get started quickly 
Thanks for the answer, but do you think that being easy to learn is a sufficient criteria itself to justify its use in an entreprise ?

Yes, because companies are often unwilling to provide sufficient resources for the learning process, and this is less of an issue for easy to learn languages.
More to say, it is a good idea to make stage where you create working env and then just copy this env to clear runtime on next stage. This approach makes you free of this hard to remember «no-cache» arguments.
Unfortunately this is a misconception. While Python is certainly easier compared to languages like C and C++ (mostly because it has less traps) I've seen the consequences of a low entry barrier to coding. The language ease of use is just one element, but then come a whole host of techniques, convention and practices that go beyond the language itself. I am not trying to do any gatekeeping here, but my point is while there's probably a lot of self-claimed python developers, very few actually make the cut for people you want to hire for a complex or medium complex software product. 
Threads are good for waiting, not for doing. If you want numerical operations done fast, where you do have a multithreaded runner, then you can certainly use python libraries that use threads. Only they drop to C and relinquish the GIL. 
How about using [https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-scm/](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-scm/) instead of python-versioneer? Can someone please provide some feedback on the versus between these options? Both take the package version from git tags.
yes Python is one of the most popular coding language in the world. It is used in various of fields like web designing , software development, graphic designing . We can also create a website using Python . Python is a major coding language used in Data Science too. But why is it becoming soo popular ?? The main reason is because it is user friendly, open sourced ,variety of libraries etc. This is the reason why people are Pursuing [Course for Python](http://pythonandmltrainingcourses.com/courses/best-diploma-in-python-course-in-delhi/) in great numbers. For knowing more about why Python is soo much used you can refer to [Quora answer.](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Python-a-language-of-choice-for-data-scientists/answer/Raj-Shivakoti) **python code for printing hello** print('Hello, world!') **C++ code to print hello** #include &lt;iostream&gt; using namespace std; int main() { cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, World!"; return 0; } 
Machine learning, AI, data science, neural networks hype. It'll die down again: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter
**AI winter** In the history of artificial intelligence, an AI winter is a period of reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence research. The term was coined by analogy to the idea of a nuclear winter. The field has experienced several hype cycles, followed by disappointment and criticism, followed by funding cuts, followed by renewed interest years or decades later. The term first appeared in 1984 as the topic of a public debate at the annual meeting of AAAI (then called the "American Association of Artificial Intelligence"). *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
True, but the top comment was about taking a non-coder and upskilling them, rather than specifically seeking out self-claimed Python developers.
Exactly this, it's also amazing for quick prototyping and design. Plus it's simple enough that someone who has never done any programming before can get up and running relatively quickly and with that aspect it's a great first language to learn for understanding programming structure and concepts. It also has a whole ecosystem of libraries people have created for it, making it very powerful and intuitive for a more advanced programmer. With the power of computers nowadays the overhead is relatively trivial, although it does depend on the type of project you want and if you absolutely *need* that extra overhead. I don't come from a programming background by any means, but Python has enabled me as a musician to create my own hardware controllers and custom synthesizers, if Python didn't exist there would be no way in hell I would be able to actually do any of that stuff without devoting weeks, if not months or more to do what I want. It allows other "makers" like me to implement more advanced projects that we wouldn't otherwise be able to do. I'm positive the maker community isn't the sole reason that Python is the most popular, but I'd be willing to bet it makes a decent impact. Lower barrier to entry means more people are going to use it, be that good or bad. We see that with digital audio workstations as well.

Define "works with Python". Normally, you would: - Create 3D models in the modelling software - Export the models in a suitable format - Load the models into your Python application The modelling software and the Python part don't need to know anything about each other, you only need to make sure both ends use the same 3D model format. OBJ and AC3D are easy to work with, and supported by most modelling software solutions. The best-of-breed of free-software modelling software is probably Blender; it takes some serious effort to get used to it, but it's the most polished and featureful one I know of, by a wide margin. You may also be interested in checking out FlightGear and its ecosystem; I'm sure you can find a lot of useful aerospace-related information there, as well as fairly decent 3D models of various aircraft, published under open source licenses.
Documentation is a huge omission here; Sphinx and autodoc make it so straightforward to document your code, and encourage good practice in maintaining relevant docstrings.

I would suggest that most Python "developers" are like me - less developer and more scripter. I've written an awful lot of code in my life (both in Python and Perl before that), but rarely more than a couple of hundred lines for a single piece of work. Personally I never call myself a developer/programmer, merely a scripter (or maybe coder).
Pretty lame, I do it all the time to hack away on sites. This is how you can steal content from websites if they do not protect their API's with one time hashes
Yep. It's coming in the next article!
Does this explain why Jython's been trending in the subreddit recently? Years of no-one having heard of it, and suddenly several posts all at once. So, some big edu has started using Jython?
Jython is a really odd choice since it basically has no future. What kinda course is that?
Blender uses Python for scripting.
Do you go to NKU?
if everything else fails, you can get a full computer with a desktop &amp; GUI on the cloud from Amazon Workspace - but it's expensive so try to find another way. I know someone who uses that for video game bots that read the screen. He just runs the game on the cloud machine. (Why the game server allows that IP to connect, I'll never know)
Thank you. I have always been very upfront about the status of a codebase and management decisions. This gig is a valuable lesson in lying.. Want me to further destroy your database? Of course Sir! What a great idea! Will do! o7 
I have not seen that package before, but after doing some digging, I can see why we did not use it. `setuptools-scm` is a plugin for `setuptools`, which means you need to add `setup_requires` to your `setup.py`. `pip` takes extra manual configuration to tell it where to pull packages for `setup_requires` (see https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#controlling-setup-requires). `versioneer` gets installed directly into the repo and has no external dependencies. When making personal open source packages, this is not too much of an issue, but once you start getting into larger companies that have internal PyPi repos, this is a lot more work to maintain. And if someone wants to setup a project that uses your package that has this, you know how to add those configs manually, will attempt to pull from the public PyPi, which make be against your security policies, especially if you have an internal one. That being said, it does look like `setuptools-scm` is better maintained, so it may be a good choice as well, baring the things I mentioned above. 
Why isn't switch-case an option?
Do you really have to scrape PuTTY, or can you just run the program yourself and find the word in the output?
Thanks I'll check it out today at work
Unfortunately it has to come from putty. The string I'm about to scrape comes from a program that I dont have access to the code.
Yes, but does the program launch PuTTY, or does the user launch it inside PuTTY?
&gt; if a string is found in the desktop application You mean like a screenshot of the desktop app and you ask for tool which could find a string in the screenshot?
Thank you for the resources! I started out thinking I would write this series of articles with [cookie-cutter pypackage](https://cookiecutter-pypackage.readthedocs.io) as the base. What I learned is that it's tricky to modify the structure or understand what's going on without first building the parts step by step. Tox, Travis, and code coverage can be configured quite a few different ways. I plan to add an article on Tox to the series. It's a super powerful tool that could use more tutorials. I plan to address pyenv in the same article. Versioneer, [bump2version](https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version), and [incremental](https://github.com/twisted/incremental) appear to do the same thing. The next article in the series will cover versioning (and bump2version) and docs. pip-tools looks interesting. Thanks!
WinAppDriver, here an example: https://github.com/Microsoft/WinAppDriver/blob/master/Samples/Python/calculatortest.py It can be used to "spy" on other windows application to scrape the content. I believe it only works on Windows 10, that being said.
That is not hard at all. The only hard part is remembering this monstrosity for[ installing dependencies before there is multi-stage build.](https://github.com/ultraauth/django_openidconnect_starter_app/blob/5a98a37d00719d2e95218da355653f4480e54f11/Dockerfile) scanelf --needed --nobanner --recursive /usr/local \ | awk '{ gsub(/,/, "\nso:", $2); print "so:" $2 }' \ | sort -u \ | xargs -r apk info --installed \ | sort -u \ | xargs -r apk --no-cache add --virtual .run-deps &amp;&amp; \
Excellent!
My background is the inverse of yours (bunch of Python knowledge, zero genetics), but overall my experience has been really positive. One giant complaint: they should abandon the "unlocking problems" functionality and enable users to solve any problem they want. Project Euler does this and imo it's way better...if you're not familiar, PE is basically Rosalind, but strictly mathematics. If you're math-inclined and trying to level up your Python skills, it's another great resource
hey, can I message you about this?
Check out OpenVSP. It has a python API and can create meshes/run some aero analyses. 
I remember using jython for one single lab, looking at something multimedia (WAV file manipulation maybe?). Terrible environment, I understand the premise of using java, but outdated and slow. I'm happy that they cut jython the next semester!
Should be `from pyside2.QtMultimedia import QSound`. For future reference when reading the docs, they provide the class name in the docs, &amp;#x200B; [https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/PySide2/QtMultimedia/QSound.html#PySide2.QtMultimedia.QSound](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/PySide2/QtMultimedia/QSound.html#PySide2.QtMultimedia.QSound) &amp;#x200B; See how it says, &gt; class PySide2.QtMultimedia.QSound(filename\[, parent=nullptr\])[**¶**](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/PySide2/QtMultimedia/QSound.html#PySide2.QtMultimedia.QSound) That should be an indication of how to import it.
Absolutely. Even if the company is willing to devote resources to train employees in a language and its environment, it then comes to the actual usage of the language. Most things in python are *extremely* easy to do, and a huge amount of libraries are available to accomplish so many tasks. Employees have to learn less: for example, why learn how to do permutations or combinations when itertools does this for you? Why create a CSV parser when this is in the standard library? Sure, other languages provide niceties too, but python seems to have an edge in this regard. Plus, python is easy to manage. It reads close to English so it can be fairly easy to understand. What I'm trying to say is, companies don't usually care about *good* code or code that's novel. Companies want a minimal amount of time spent to accomplish the bare minimum. It's like any job: do the most in the least amount of time. Python often lets you get the most done with the least amount of time and effort, so bottom line, the employee gets paid for less time while accomplishing the same task

The user launches it inside putty
Is there a reason your program can't launch it directly? 
With `d.join()` you are waiting for the subprocess to complete, which it never does.

Ah, I've been looking to do this as well with a discord bot I have. It seems there is no official API but glad to hear you're getting it to work with what I assume is the [API from Apex Tracker](https://apex.tracker.gg/site-api) . 
Can't be automated using python?
That sounds awesome. yes I want to do a bit of both and I am math inclined, or have been recently.

You are making the math too hard. That might make it easier to write the code. Every row starts with 1 Then walking across the second value is (rowNumber - 1) divided by 1. The third value is the second value times (rowNumber -2) divided by 2. The fourth value is the third value times (rowNumber - 3) divided by 3. and so on. That should help you write easier code. You don't need to worry about factorials. I'm guessing this is homework so I'll leave the coding details of how to manage line lengths, numerator and denominator increments and decrements up to you. 
We do this with cron jobs on (embedded) Linux systems and run our Python scripts as daemons. 
it was a seatwork earlier today and I have already submitted the code without it working properly. I just wanted to learn how to do it properly is all. Anyway, thank you for the advice!
I’d use the tools that Linux supplies. Cron is one choice but you could also consider services. 
With Threads you can set a daemon flag for the thread, bet you can do the same for processes

I'd recommend `cron` for simple stuff and SystemD timers for complex stuff if you're on Linux. The timers will seem like a pain in the ass, but they have some really powerful features that make them worth it.
You could use`itertools.cycle` to cycle the list. I’m not sure how it works while removing list elements.

Um... you put a return statement outside a function, which isn’t allowed (and also makes zero sense). This may be due to inconsistent or incorrect indentation.

Making an ssh connection to another computer and issuing commands is well within the python wheelhouse, maybe take a look at paramiko ([http://docs.paramiko.org/en/2.4/](http://docs.paramiko.org/en/2.4/)). I too am "fuzzy" on what putty brings to the table that you can't do straight up with python, maybe the connection information?

Airflow or Luigi?
Interested in this comment - why does it have no future?
I think this works as you describe. It uses \`% len(seq)\` to do modulo arithmetic after incrementing the index, so that if you run off the end, it returns back to 0. `def do_josephus(seq):` `index = 0` `while len(seq) &gt; 1:` `# get dropee` `drop_index = (index + 1) % len(seq)` `drop = seq.pop(drop_index)` `print('drop', drop)` `# advance to next` `index = (index + 1) % len(seq)` &amp;#x200B;
You need to write Process(target=NoEscape) (see, no parantheses after the function name) Because with () you are already calling the function yourself and not with the help of Process
nope, you use requests and it's 100x faster than selenium
and gui callbacks where you need to provide a parameter less function and you use the lambda to create appropriate call with 'hard-coded' parameters.

use systemd-run for transient services
Depending on what's needed I either launch directly from cron, or have another python script that cron fires to make decisions about launching/ checking on other processes. Basically my own home made watchdog complete with an config file to make changes on the fly 
I'm just referring to the fact that it hasn't been updated since 2015, and it only conforms to Python 2 standards, which is end of life next year.
Only if you are going to write a supervisor. Not a fun task.
Cron bad
systemd, supervisord
Systemd is definitely the way to go force services, but if you want to do dynamic things you may want to create a supervisor yourself. I will strongly suggest doing in asyncio. I made for a customer an API controlled watcher with autorestart feature (crap code, was done in an emergency do workaround shit Java app crashing in production), but you can check it here: https://github.com/eLvErDe/asyncio_process_watcher
cron ?
Cron is past. Better use systemd timers !
I am working on immersing myself in the language since I know almost nothing at all. I bought a book that teaches basics of Python to kids, and wrote my first version of Hello World modified so that my computer negatively responds to my inputs with rude comments. I know Im a complete noob, but I'm just happy to be starting and hopefully can make some friends in the community since I don't have any friends that are in the field. 
Sounds like a cool project. I'm majoring in Accounting so seeing people combine the two is pretty cool :)
Hi, I don't want to waste your time, but I'm new to the field and was wondering if you wouldn't mind giving a brief explanation of why this is all so bad? Thanks, and good luck with the job!
why? I have a bunch of scripts that have been running for years with no problems so am really wondering why you say this.
Pretty much everything is bad. &amp;#x200B; What daemon library do you guys use? There are lots of choices. We like daemonize but have also patched it a little for our own use: [https://github.com/thesharp/daemonize](https://github.com/thesharp/daemonize)
&gt;cannot render css properly (as the standard describe it) release a python module strawman aaaaaand let's see &gt;"def streamToPowerBI" &gt; &gt;really well named python function basic ignorance of the spark ecosystem
What is the competition?
This sounds like a fun project , post cat videos when done please.
You specify version ranges in the toml file e.g. \`black = {version = "&gt;18.9b0", allows-prereleases = true, python = "&gt;=3.6"}\` which is akin to your \`setup.py\` abstract version; and when the lockfile is generated, records the concrete version that the recursive constraints resolved into (as far as i can tell, per supported python version ranges that you/your recursive dependencies claim to be compatible with).
Don't know for before/after request but for the global g object, you get app in the request object so you can store anything there. I usually create a factory to build the app and store the additional services here. Aiohttp provided callback to start/stop services too. You may want to check some of my code here: https://github.com/eLvErDe/bosch-dome-rcpplus-ptz-api/blob/master/api_factory.py
Switch to Elixir 
As stated already, you can make the ssh request using python itself. Inside of the ssh environment though it barely makes sense to use putty at all given that windows and all other operating systems support ssh from their respective terminals. Worst case scenario, you could pipe that into your program and mess with it that way if making the programatic ssh connection doesn't work for you. 
I have switched a few apps from Flask/gevent to Quart and the experience has been very good.
AHA that seems like a viable option...I'll try it right now...thanks!.
Look into Flask.
Yep, that's where the article linked, without mentioning [this issue](https://github.com/google/grumpy/issues/406) and the subsequent repo :facepalm:

the answer of 0x256 is still true aswell. you'll need to get rid of `d.join()` or the main process will wait for the endless-loop again. 
Web Application can be developed using Django a web application framework that uses MVT ( model view template) Architecture. The reason to choose Django is you can scale up with you Idea easily without rewriting major part of your code to fit in new functionality. Having said that Django has a very steep learning curve to master. Flask on the other hand is a quick and easy way to develop and deploy small web applications. Hope this helps.
I'd check that you're consistent in tabs vs spaces first.
Nice, but &gt; Known Issues &gt; &gt; * Debugging extensions doesn’t work. 
hahaha
Left is Visual Studio Code.Right is IDLE 3.6 64Bit. Any explanation of why this is happening and how to fix it is appreciated.
You have to use commas to separate args of a function
I could be wrong, but Python born in Leningrad during the Soviet Union. He studied law at Leningrad State University, graduating in 1975.[6] Python was a KGB foreign intelligence officer for 16 years, rising to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel before resigning in 1991 to enter politics in Saint Petersburg. He moved to Moscow in 1996 and joined President Boris Yeltsin's administration, rising quickly through the ranks and becoming Acting President on 31 December 1999, when Yeltsin resigned.
OP-- Are you familiar with the http protocol? "get" and "post" "requests"? and "responses" from the server? These are the ingredients you'll need: * A web server. * Some web app code-- * A. Takes request. If the user sends data with the request, you'll likely use a 'post' request. If it's a request for data, then a 'get' should be fine. * B. In the web app "route" which intercepts the request, it runs your python script (after setting up your server, you'll need to install the software that your script uses, such as selenium, etc.) * C. Upon completion of the script, the script passes the final dataset over to the webapp. * D. The webapp then delivers the final data to the user. * On the frontend, where the user is, the data is received. Here, you might want to use some sort of graphing framework (javascript?) to display the data in a meaningful way (in a graph or chart, etc.) So, I suggest getting started with some sort of web server framework. Flask is a nice one to start with, especially since you're familiar with Python. ExpressJS is also quite user friendly, but it's in javascript. You'll need to do a bit of reading/studying and experimenting with coding a web server though. I suggest checking out some ebooks and tutorials on web servers in python or javascript.

Adding commas worked, now I fell and look dum. But why did each editor act difrently? 
What's not to love about something this simple &amp; used by so many distributions + Yocto/openembedded: [https://github.com/cronie-crond/cronie/](https://github.com/cronie-crond/cronie/)
known programmers: never use a debugger (
... the error is the same. They look different cause they are separate editors....
It is just their separate ways of highlighting syntax issues.
If you need more than what cron can provide, you may want to look into something like airflow.
Are you referring to why the left gave you a squiggly underline and the right highlighted "input"? If so, it's just different editors will notify you of the line the error is occurring in different ways. Some editors could be the same, some different. 
God no. Check out [http://pyviz.org/](http://pyviz.org/) 
Could you post a snippet of your code? The general format should look like: def homepage(request): return render(request=request , template\_name=index.html, context= )
I’d rather not send my complete files over to some entity on the internet. 
Why are ppl using reminder bot downvoted here? lol
Not sure to understand correctly but why don't you juste run "whois" command and parse output (check subprocess.check_output) ?
Debugger is probably the single most useful tool you can have. Not using a debugger is like running with your hands tied behind your back. Sure you can run but once you fall you are falling hard. 
I started do that yesterday ;) 
(rhetorical) what is it about "web dev" that seems to inevitably lead to framework spawn-rate-explosion? its not a js thing, its a web thing.

Atlassian has a solid beginner tutorial if you're someone who prefers reading material while learning: [https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud) &amp;#x200B; If you're more of a visual learner, I found this tutorial series to be great - he's very clear and concise in his narration and it's easy to follow: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyuRouwmQCjlxyO-45o53YCWjBCM-fA7L](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyuRouwmQCjlxyO-45o53YCWjBCM-fA7L)
Yes
Cron. If you want something a little more featured, [runit](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Runit) is nice and lightweight.
There are WAY too many reasons to put into a comment response so I'll try to summarize the most common (note: not using cron is a recommendation from pretty much EVERYWHERE you can ask about it). 1. What happens when a cron job fails? Are you sure? What about if a system is down when a cron job should've run (for a reboot or something)? 2. Cron itself doesn't log jobs. That makes things real fun when the problem isn't the application but cron itself. 3. The environment and path of a cronjob is quite different than the default for the system. This leads to all kinds of fun. 4. There are different formats for script names and cron entries between /etc/crontab, /etc/cron.d, and the cron.daily/cron.hourly/, and it varies based on options and distros as well. 5. Every restart the cron daemon while a job is running? What happens? Again, are you sure? 6. What happens when you change the timezone on a system? Does cron notice or does it need to be restarted? What about jobs running currently? 7. Cronjobs don't get a STDOUT by default. If your application outputs to the console, expect trouble unless you modify the cron daemon options or can silence the application 8. Any password expirations will cause a cron job to fail silently by default 9. If you don't notice a cronjob is having an error, you can quickly eclipse the TasksMax setting and silently fail to launch upcoming cronjobs Cron just has so many bad defaults, gotchas, and exceptional behaviors that it is a poor choice for a mission critical job. Sure, you can have success with it, but there are more appropriate and reliable choices (that also have a simpler scheduling format). 
yo dawg, we heard you like browsers...
Thanks for the comment - mention this post when you sign up and I'll send you a beta key right away. Also, here is a link to the flask server source code I am running in the tutorial: https://github.com/wayscript/code_snippets/tree/master/flask_demo
Thanks for the response, it is very helpful. I guess I am of the feeling that my scripps are of simple enough use case and are doing their own logging that if ain't broke why fix it. In the future though I will consider this carefully when I need to implement new systems.
yeah unfortunately i have to use aiohttp
awesome ill look into that thanks
So you're telling me that `console.log()` is not the ultimate debugging tool? /s
/r/whoosh
Are there any issues with Quart that means you cannot use it? I ask as I'd like to fix them :).
Why? 
We use monit, it works ok. Haven't dicked about with its scheduling much, but if you want something to maintain persistent processes it's pretty solid.
Luigi is a great choice.
Ok, I have a feeling that this is going to be a very stupid question, but what about the python library schedule? I only know about cron a bit, and I heard of systemd and supervisord (want to look into those soon), but I want to know my options. 
Literally supervisor(d)
Disappointing, was expecting: import flask my_framework = flask &amp;#x200B;
My opinion: aiohttp is the only mature async server at the moment. Everyday new framework are created, saying they are ten time faster than yesterday framework. Just like JS ecosystem. At some point most of them will disappear or stop being maintained. Until this day comes, I'll stick to aiohttp.
Thanks for the in depth response! I have used requests a little before actually, I will have to read up on the documentation. I have a webserver and know a little JavaScript so everything you told me is helpful.
Thanks, I appreciate the insight. I will look more into both frameworks.
This was my assumption, just wanted to make sure there wasn't a more simple answer that I was missing. Thanks!
Of course not: PRINT statements are!
Dude this is Great. &amp;#x200B; Any more ideas how to read more about Machine Learning and which course to register. &amp;#x200B;
Run vs Code? Id go with Run.
I agree that it's a bit clunky, but you can always directly alias the import to be more clear to you `from X import Y as Z` I think the cleanest way is to not do your import until right before you need the thing, although it is nice to have all of them at the top of the file
Sounds like homework...
If memory overhead is truly a concern, Python might not be your best choice, or if you absolutely must reconcile your need for namespaces, try \`from flask import Flask as flask\_Flask\` [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3591962/python-import-x-or-from-x-import-y-performance](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3591962/python-import-x-or-from-x-import-y-performance)
No problem. It has it's use cases, but there are generally better options. In the case of it ain't broke, well it ain't broke - don't fix it. Mainly don't use without your own logging and never with "must happen or else" type stuff, or "can't happen twice" type stuff.
Blender has a python API 
 Hello my spirit animal. 
The answer is yes! In all honesty, what have you tried so far and why isnt that working?
should i read that as "debugging doesn't work" or "debugging custom extensions written for VS code doesn't work"? to me there's a large difference between the two, as i don't write extensions and don't need to debug them. but if it's the former, then yea this is basically useless.
Hmm. Something like... count = [] for word in words: count.append(set(word.split(''))) print collections.counter(count) That's untested - on my mobile phone...
Not homework. If it is against the rules to post this kind of question here I apologize and I guess should just go to SO? Or would r/learnpython be more appropriate?
I mean the most basic way I can think of is to just do something like {letter: sum(1 for word in my_list if letter in word) for letter in unique_letters} where I'd have to find a way to get the unique letters in my_list. But I'm thinking there is a better way than that...
&gt;I think the cleanest way is to not do your import until right before you need the thing ◔\_◔ I'm not downvoting you, but I would like to strongly disagree with you on this one. Quoting the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/): *There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.* PEP 8 is a well defined standard (which is a solid baseline as a coding style), and there's a section about imports :-) [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports)

I checked that, and it seems to be ok, but i'm not sure that it will be work for 500 website
To explain... We run through each word and split it with into its individual letters and apply the set function which removes all duplication. These are then added to our list and finally printed with the collections.counter you already mentioned. 
Why not ? Check multiprocessing.ThreadPoolExecutor to run calls parallelized
You do not use namespacing to avoid memory utilization. Consider the following: # X.py def Y(): return __do_it() def __do_it(): .... Now, if you do this: from X import Y It is *still* necessary for the entirety of the module to be loaded, even if you only have a reference to a single name from the module. Python has no way of knowing ahead of time what that item's dependencies are in its containing module, so the entire module is loaded. The *only* advantage you get by using the from X import Y syntax is that you don't have to repeat the name of X in your code to access it.
No problem I use vscode but printf is enough for me for debugging. 
It's not about that, i just see "request limit exceeded" promt :(
Let's say I have a bunch of `return None` in 5 different `except`'s. How do I write this more concisely? The following is an example: try: f = open('myfile.txt') s = f.readline() i = int(s.strip()) except OSError as err: print("OS error: {0}".format(err)) return None except ValueError: print("Could not convert data to an integer.") return None except: print("Unexpected error:", sys.exc_info()[0]) return None # some other code return None The first thing that comes to mind is to use a dictionary, but are there better means to do so?
use a set to get the unique letters, use collections.Counter to tally them
Both methods use the same amount of memory. The only difference is the access. For example: &gt;&gt;&gt; import sys &gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import date &gt;&gt;&gt; date &lt;class 'datetime.date'&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; sys.modules['datetime'] &lt;module 'datetime' from 'C:\\Python36\\lib\\datetime.py'&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; sys.modules['datetime'].time &lt;class 'datetime.time'&gt; Even though only the "date" class was explicitly imported, the entire module has been loaded, and is accessible via the sys.modules dictionary. Conclusion: do what makes sense for your code. "import module" gives you access via the module's name. "from module import xyz" gives specific access, which is still traceable and explicit. Just don't do "from module import \*", which pollutes your namespace with implicit imports.
Is there a number of years of maintenance that you consider equals maturity? Or is there another metric?
Neat. Will make Chromebooks even *more* relevant. This + Jupyter Notebooks = GG
You're fucked then. You obviously querying some remote whois server and they blacklisted you. Check the manpage, maybe you can specify which server to query and find additional ones. You may also want to figure out when getting blacklisted and implement rate limiting in your app...
``` import X ``` is generally preferred over ``` from X import Y ``` Because explicit is better than implicit. However, this is just stupid: ``` abcdefg.hijklmnop.qrstuvwxyz.ABCDEFGHIJKLMN(foo, bar) ``` And that's where practicality beats purity. When met with the situation above, I tend to do one of two things: A) ``` from abcdefg.hijklmnop import qrstuvwxyz ... qrstuvwxyz.ABCDEFGHIJKLMN(foo, bar) ``` This is an okay but not necessarily great happy midway point between stupid and lost and you can still retain an appropriate level of name-spacing here. or (if I am okay with the side effects...) B) Add code into the `__init__.py` file to bring the functions up to the top of the folder... ``` # __init__.py from abcdefg.hijklmnop.qrstuvwxyz import * ``` The problem with the latter above in a larger project is that it's not clear what really executes underneath and this approach impairs maintenance long-term for the more immediate reduction in developer overhead short-term.
This is not a hw assignment. This is me trying to learn data science on python on my own. I did not ask any question that would have been asked by any hw. I am simply asking what one part of a function does from this code.
One thing to note is that there’s another option than lambdas for simple keys like this, attrgetter and itemgetter in the operators module. The above example would be: from operators import attrgetter people_list.sort(key=attrgetter(“last”)) (Please forgive formatting, written on my phone.)
Have you actually measured a difference in memory consumption between one technique and the other? I kind of doubt you could detect any difference at all. When you import a module, Python creates a namespace and then runs the code of the module inside it, some of which create names in that namespace as a desired side-effect. For example, running a block of code that starts with `def myfunc():` creates a callable object and the name `myfunc` that is bound to it. The alternate form of an import statement, `from X import Y`, still imports X, but instead of binding the name X locally, it finds Y in the module's namespace and binds it instead. The module is still loaded. &amp;#x200B; To illustrate this point, consider this module. # example.py def spam(): print("hello") def eggs(): print("world") Now we use it in the REPL, showing that the eggs function is still available, just not in the same lexical scope. &gt;&gt;&gt; import sys &gt;&gt;&gt; from example import spam &gt;&gt;&gt; spam() hello &gt;&gt;&gt; eggs() Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; NameError: name 'eggs' is not defined &gt;&gt;&gt; example.eggs() Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; NameError: name 'example' is not defined &gt;&gt;&gt; sys.modules['example'].eggs() world
Not sure it's kinda subjective. I'd say its rather related to a consensus in the community. In sync world, there're flask and Django and you probably want one of them. In async, you'll see quite a lot people using aiohttp and dozen of other framework that *looks* (again subjective) used for nothing else than developing a new framework.
``` print("I am here.") ``` Still works.

It is not true that "import X" is preferred over "from X import Y". The latter is no less explicit than the former. In fact, one could say that "from X import Y" is *more* explicit than "import X", as this implicitly imports all its attributes, such as X.Y.

Yes I think that works. I gathered the set of each word to get the unique letters, so that my list above became my_list_unique = ['cat', 'duck', 'el'] Then I did a collections.Counter("".join(my_list_unique)).most_common() And that looks like it works. Couldn't do it in one line but I think it's neater than what I had above. Thanks!
Alright! Thanks! 
Did you try running that? It gets an error saying join expects a string but received a set
Fixed. instead if `str.join`, do `''.join`.
Take a look at [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) and its Python interface [SolidPython](https://github.com/SolidCode/SolidPython). It allows you to programmatically define a 3D model.
Personally I use `as X` in two situations: 1. Actual naming collision 2. The true name becomes horribly misleading when used in a particular context
Ah gotcha. Looks great. Thanks!
I'm not sure if there are more ways to do this, there probably is. But I've good experience with the message broker RabbitMQ for multiple projects, working with RPIs. Talking back and forward between client(s) and server. It's easy to send a command and do something based on that.
As a case and point, the exact scenario above is that "Y" has lost its namespace and it's harder (especially for someone unfamiliar with the library X) to trace where "Y" actually came from. In general, `from X import Y` is best used with `X` is long and just having `Y` actually makes the code more readable. But on average, `X.Y` is far clearer. We'll just have to agree to disagree.
This seems like a post that exists purely to push Kite and their honestly-not-suspect business model.
Can you tell us more about the dynamic stuff? What do you want the supervisor to do? 
Flask will probably easier but you can use the standard library. https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/http.server.html#module-http.server

So, the producer would be my server. Can my server also be a consumer and have a queue? So they can talk back and forth? 
Of course!

of all the languages i've used in 25 years, python is the easiest to import shit in. 
how about vim + ssh
So, stenography? 
yeah not clicking that. Share the source via pastebin or GitHub. No one wants to click on an executable, even if it is just sitting on your Google drive. on topic, it is really important to know how you are deciding to break up the plaintext, and how it is being distributed into the image. For the former, you need to provide sufficient complexity that it cannot be undone by brute Force, while also making sure that if someone encrypts the exact same thing, the result will be completely different. For the latter, it is easy to tell when an image has been modified, especially if that image is readily available in unmodified form. Look into steganography.
Sure, if that's how the 'from' syntax works under the hood, then just import X is clearly better. Thanks for the comment!
Good stuff, thank you!
Way I've always done it.
I'm planning on using a pi! Thank for the link I'm check it out. 
It doesn't work very well with python...
you must really love your browser.

That's gonna be super useful! :)
Idk why i did google drive instead of github, ill change it right now, also i store it in the image as base64, and i'll look into steganography.
Most libraries are simply the author having a need, fulfilling that need, and then releasing the code so that others who have a similar problem in the future will have a solution. Then there's the sponsored libraries, developed by individuals working for companies that make use of the library, but want to share the library with others, for one reason or another. And then there are libraries that exist to complement a proprietary product, maintained by the vendor of said product to make their product more appealing to people that use the language. There's lots of reasons to share code, not all of them have to do with money.
Now they need to make an Android app

That's cool that it has an API. What language is the code in? I have a somewhat similar situation...I was trying to get into a program I use that controls a GC. The program has no API tho.

If you you are looking to OCR the PDF, you could always use an open source binary package such as [tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/). If you are looking to extract textual content (e.g if it has already been OCR'ed which some PDF creation utilities do automatically) then I would recommend poppler utils or an API based solution such as [this](https://rapidapi.com/sam.koucha/api/pdf-to-text) Alternatively there are web-based tools for such as [this](https://pdfsoftware.net)
&gt; That's not normal, is it? Yes, it is, kinda. If you open `C:\Users\DAN~1.SMI`, you should get `C:\Users\dan.smith`. Windows still keeps short names for compatibility.

depends entirely on what you need to do - you might not even need a database depending on the scenario.
Good question.. 
because some organizations has powerBI as corporate tool, and have blind faith on it, so it's easy to introduce thing s like this. 
&gt;crossbar.io wamp Any good tutorials for crossbar with python? 
What else have you checked? Is pip itself up-to-date? Tried disabling antivirus (even if Windows Defender)?
Postgres. Rock solid and sane.

There are good reasons for not returning a default for missing key - the key being missing is often *meaningful*, and such implicit creation of empty keys can lead to bugs. But where you do want it, you can ask for it - the relevant syntax would be: [dict_obj.get('propertyname')] for object in objects] Which will return `None` if the property doesn't exist (you can pass the default to use as a secondary parameter to `get` if you want something else). You can also use `defaultdict` which will allow you to create a dict that'll do this by default.) &gt;Which is an absurd amount of code for something that used to seem so simple TBH, it doesn't really seem so simple - why would you *want* such a diverse set of returnvalues after all? Maybe it makes more sense used interactively, but really, I prefer python's behaviour here of always returning a consistent type, rather than automatically converting singleton lists to single objects etc. After all, the code that needs to consume these would then need to handle all 3 results. But if you want something like "Return the first item if there's any results, else `None`), then you could do: l = [obj for obj in objects if obj['property'] == value] return l[0] if l else None Or if you **really** want a 1-liner: return next([obj for obj in objects if obj['property'] == value], None) Here `next` returns the next item from a generator/sequence, and can be given a default value to return if the sequence is exhausted/empty, so the above returns the first item, or `None`
If you want to keep the nulls. [object.get("property2") for object in objects] If you don't want the nulls. [object["property2"] for object in objects if object.get("property2") is not None]
Definitely not a python pro, but you could try iterating though dict.values() and then checking if those match what you want. As of python 3.6 dictionaries are ordered to you can just enumerate through dict.values() to get the key when you need it. 
Up arrow
Always use alert()
Or runsv/runit when you don't want to use python
Some options: # no need for the call to .keys(). "in" checks keys automatically on dicts. [object['property2'] for object in objects if 'property2' in object] Or: [obj['property2'] for obj in filter(lambda x: 'property2' in x, objects)] Or: [x for x in [obj.get('property2') for obj in objects] if x] Secondly, PowerShell is just what you're more familiar with. I can imagine even more succinct syntax than what you show with PowerShell. Here's my new language doing the same thing: wo objects Succinct-ness is not the same thing as good-ness. Every language has a balance to strike between verboseness and clarity. I don't have a real problem with the python method in every one of your examples. In fact, even though I'm pretty familiar with powershell, I actively dislike the fact that powershell has so many implicit behaviors. Thirdly, I think multiple possible return value types from a function (your last example) is a code smell. However, what follows is some python I don't really like, but I wrote it anyway. I'd rather do it in multiple lines somewhat like what you illustrated. # Python &lt; 3.8 result = [x for x in [obj.get('property2') for obj in objects] if x] result = result[0] if len(result) == 1 else None # Python 3.8+ result = None if not (result := [x for x in [obj.get('property2') for obj in objects] if x]) else result[0] if len(result) == 1 else result
I’ll take it into account, thank you!
You can get a free cloud python interpreter and bash shell from pythonanywhere.com. It's heavily rate limited for the free tier, but it's usable.
That’s right, but I’m practicing for the time being and i would like to be capable of operating a database needed it be, or maybe isn’t as important as I thought it was, idk
Ok, I’ll search it up, thanks!
For part 1, you don't need to call `.keys()`: &gt;&gt;&gt; [o['property2'] for o in objects if 'property2' in o] ['special'] For part 2, you can do it in two lines using `dict.get()` in your list comprehension: objs = [o for o in objects if o.get('property', None) == value] result = objs[0] if objs else None
Can you change where Power BI looks for the python installation? Can you find the location, run python from there and install packages? I'm potentially in the same boat as you and would love to know if you figure it out. Any tips at all would be great actually. 
I love using VSCode on my HP Chromebook x360 14. Linux apps on Chromebooks is a true game changer.
Hasn’t this existed for a while in CodeSandbox?
I'm more of a #working block print('hi') #broken block print('go away') kind of guy.
I looked where powerBi is searching for python and it seems to be ok (anacondas directory). In fact I can code in every IDE, is just powerBi the one messing with my sanity xD. If I find a solution i will post it :D
Did you have to set that directory in Power BI or was it just detected as the same location as used by the PATH?
&gt;`l = [obj for obj in objects if obj['property'] == value]` This throws a `KeyError` if 'property' is not in one of the dicts in the list. `obj.get('property', None)` would handle this case.
Else: Print(‘shouldn’t see this’) One day I’ll set up a real debugger.
To be fair, it doesn't help that most debuggers are shit (for C++ anyways). 
Crostini also has you covered here. Personally I'm running PyCharm and Jupyter Notebooks inside of Crostini
Well if it fits your needs, or doesn't, I'm happy to get feedback on my s6 wrapper [essex](https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/ahpyq6/essex_a_high_level_command_line_frontend_to_s6/).
Postgres
It can run the binary elsewhere serve a web UI. Good for running vs-code on headless beefy servers.

As someone who just had to do an calculation intensive GIS operation on my laptop while away from my home computer, color me very interested.
Cron is a great way to keep running something five years after you've left the company, and all your former coworkers have no idea why a user with your name keeps running a process on the build server.
Yes, I mentioned that above for the part on using a default, but for that line I was just duplicating OPs code as-is with the only change being the "first or None" bit that it was about.
How about coverting the string to a list and passing it to statistics.mode? I’m not sure it works with characters but if it doesn’t you can always convert it to a list of the corresponding ASCII values,
This could be incredible.
One missing notes in this thread is that both `import X` and `from X import Y` have different semantic with respect to monkey patching, and when the name resolution is done. Dummy example: ``` In [1]: from numpy import array In [2]: import numpy In [3]: numpy.array = 1 In [4]: numpy.array Out[4]: 1 In [5]: array Out[5]: &lt;function numpy.array&gt; ``` This might be critical if you want to hold on the initial value of a function; say for example to wrap it and track how many times it has ben called. The above example is dump, but the replacement may happen in another module. The memory consumption will not differ, but if you do `X.Y` in a tight loop, `X.Y` is actually changes to a `getattr(X, 'Y')` whcih is recomputed everytime and may add up. Regardless, You usually don't care about this kind of issues. The question is more about readability. With namespacing you can keep naming short without having to worry about conflicting, and that what namespacing is about. You have to think "readability". The way I distinguish between `import` vs `from ... import ...` is the following: - use `from ... import` on everything you will use often, almost everywhere in the module and it will be unambiguous where the thing comes from. - use `import ...` when you happen to occasionally use one object from a module. For example on a HPC code, I would use `from numpy import random`, `import cryptography`. Now when I see `random` in the context of numerics, it is likely numpy. If it needs to be secure, I would then explicitely use `cryptography.random`. Vice versa on a TLS implementation with benchmarks, I will use `import numpy`, `from cryptography import random`. In this module it by default random is secure, but where it needs not, I can be explicit and say "numpy.random" which is faster, non-secure but explicit. 
I have some videos explaining how to use AWS lambda, which seems like a good fit for this project. Let me know if you’d like to learn more.
Staring other python script (with different argumets) from one that handles rest api, so starting/stopping and keeping them running/restarting.
So the script runs via task scheduler on your laptop but not on the server? Is it on a domain? Check if there's a GPO preventing it from running. It's always group policy...
lol, neanderthal! :) PYTHONBREAKPOINT=ipdb.set_trace python -c 'x=42;breakpoint()' 
Postgres for sure if you are just starting and based on the other comment that you want to learn a DB. Postgres is more common now and you will find more current tutorials and docs that pair Django with Postgres. MySQL if you have to deal with legacy DBs that are already MySQL. I am slowly migrating all our MySQL to Postgres and will never look back.
Looked at your history. We're definitely kindred spirits.
Well, good luck with that.
I once had an error message from some lib that read: "This is not supposed to happen."
Thank you for your time and feedback, I really appreciate it. This is weird, while editing I remembered I added the creation of a temporary directory because the extract function from zipfile creates a directory tree if the files happen to be inside some directories (for office xml (docx), at the /word/media directory, for example). I'll probably change it again so I can extract individual files without the function creating these directories but for the moment I kept the temp directory creation and the copy to destination processes. I used parts of your example above (thank you very much) as inspiration to refactor the whole script, since you were right about using the `with` block with zipfile to perform several tasks without calling zipfile every time. Now my code is better and I'll find time to refactor it again if needed. Thanks again.
I kind of know the answer but. Can you use matplotlib using this?
Fusion360 is free for hobbyists and has a full python API.
Honestly, if most of the devs of the libs I commonly use had a patreon, I’d donate some.
This is a really weird subreddit... I've seen people get voted down for promoting the virtues of python and upvoted for comparing Python to Go unfavorably. You're right about regex. I like this example, a regex that [implements the official RFC 5322 email address standard](https://www.regular-expressions.info/email.html): \A(?:[a-z0-9!#$%&amp;'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\.[a-z0-9!#$%&amp;'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)* | "(?:[\x01-\x08\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x1f\x21\x23-\x5b\x5d-\x7f] | \\[\x01-\x09\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x7f])*") @ (?:(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])? | \[(?:(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.){3} (?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?|[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]: (?:[\x01-\x08\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x1f\x21-\x5a\x53-\x7f] | \\[\x01-\x09\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x7f])+) \])\z There is no sane reason to ever write a regex like this rather than in human-comprehensible code. On top of that, no human can see this and know that it's validating an email address. Even if you *do* know what it's supposed to do, it's an act of unholy translation to gauge what it's actually doing. 
No I won’t. The gd browser doesn’t get to be my UI base for every f’n thing I do. FFS.
Just you wait, Python 4 is right around the corner.
It’s pretty powerful, I’m new to it and been learning it for about 5 months. I really wished you could optionally use brackets and not have to rely on indentations. Other than that lambda is still a concept i struggle with. My IQ needs help. :-)
&gt; Python supports regex by default through re module. It's in the standard &gt;library. There are more than one thing that made it into the Python standard library that are, upon reflection, unpythonic. Heck, even all the different formatting options now run up against "one obvious way in which to do it". This would make a good PyCon talk actually. Let's recall that Kenn Reitz has stated in a Pycon talk before that he believes several of the standard modules violate several tenets of the Zen Of Python. &gt;So I don't think Python is somehow against regular expressions. The organization might not be against regular expressions. Guido Van Rossum might not be against regular expressions (although [maybe he is](https://twitter.com/gvanrossum/status/1072535194131984386?lang=en)). But the philosophy that gave birth to Python is against regular expressions.
I came from a language that used "Begin" and "End" instead of braces, so I welcomed the newfound brevity! :-)
Google colab covers that really well now too.
thanks guys :D tomorrow's a new day and a new script...!

Why do you like Postgres more than MySQL? I have a project where it would be easier to use MySQL (as the data is already in a MySQL db), but if it’s a major value add, I might be willing to convert it over

I think it's awesome, great work! I'm working through a python course and am slightly ahead of you in the curve, would you mind if I refactored your script with what I've learned so far and send it back to you? Sometimes the best way to learn is to try and explain what you know to someone else. &amp;#x200B; Cheers and keep up the great work!

Hey good job on sticking on with it! It’s not easy for most people
Great work dude, it's a great feeling that not many people experience to create like this
systemd on embedded? I’ve not seen that before. 
If you already have everything in MySQL and it is working fine I say leave it be. In our use case we ran in to trouble with our MySQL datatypes not being good for our needs so we would have had to refactor (is that the term for databases?) or move to another DB and I chose another DB. If you want to know the details I will give them but another thing that moved me to go to Postgres was PostGIS as we have geospatial data that is better served (literally) with it than MySQL was.
do it!!! :D 4 chapters today... that script took me about an hour to complete (believe it or not lol)

I’ve talked to other programmers, like actual way more professional programmers, that think lambda functions are just razzle dazzle.
Dude, I get python is everyone’s holy grail but PowerBi is going to be much more powerful as a BI tool in a corporate environment.
