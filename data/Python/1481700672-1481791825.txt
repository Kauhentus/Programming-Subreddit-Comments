Yes. Your demise has been scheduled for [redacted], please make reservations at your favorite funeral home accordingly.
The website tells me that my most negative content is about how I think Star Wars is ok but not great. Taking offense for my indifference towards Star Wars is what i expected from a redditor, not a website lol 
My most positive ones are mostly sarcastically quoting other people haha, #3 is me calling Bernie supporters degenerates.
This is really neat! How is nltk? I haven't used it but have heard good things
Pretty cool stuff! I'm not qualified to provide any additional comment but I'm sure it's valuable to have more options and flexibility in the procedural audio module, so thanks a lot for your additions! Side note: I had a look at the [commits](https://bitbucket.org/pyglet/pyglet/commits/branch/default) and it looks like you forgot to setup Mercurial (user name and e-mail) ;)
Most negative sentence: "I can't stand middle-upper class liberals who pay in black money, buy houses when the economy is bad and are complaining about the crisis all the damn time." LOL
LOL more accurately it has pointed out that I'm a sarcastic prick (most of my 'positive' comments are sarcastic). 
The most positive person out of 2641 users is a guy doing cum-tributes. Sounds about right.
&gt; -0.4767 Can I still change to being an Apache Attack Helicopter? Your site doesn't like Apache Helicopters.
I take offence to this program. I am totally a dick. I am not 'slightly positive'. It's a very good idea and an incredibly neat implementation, but I have to share this for it is simply wrong. Can I request an honorary loss of points somehow? (Nice program. I found it funny how my best and worst comment are either from the same thread or from technical discussions about games. Also, "So, no worries" is a very negative thing to say. So no worries!)
redditor with username 'maniexx' not found huh
I see the /s but sarcasm detection is actually a really interesting problem in natural language processing. A majority of the accuracy in doing this has actually came from a deviation in tone between other pieces of writing (60-80% accuracy), and detection without any context is lackluster at best (70-50%). Citing my sauce(s): http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/papers/bamman+smith.icwsm15.pdf
Just rename Home Assistant to **H**ome **A**ssistent with **P**ython. 
lmao at least you keep it real
It doesn't do well with sarcasm, but it's still cool :)
Nice idea! Took [this list](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words), and found immediately 638 matches, with some more good words: * ato.py * cam.py * chap.py * chop.py * chum.py * cree.py * cris.py * crum.py * do.py * flap.py * flop.py * hip.py * hum.py * isoto.py * jum.py * loo.py * mop.py * nap.py * plum.py * pup.py * scrum.py * sna.py * snoo.py * soa.py * sou.py * s.py * stri.py * tram.py * tri.py * um.py * wee.py Has potential. But now I need an AI to evaluate filter words for good matches, because it takes time to do it all manually.
You're a brave person, trying to quantify the nuances of the English language is a seriously difficult thing to do. Makes for some amusing results though.
That is exactly why ML/AI is hard, and also the sort of progress Google Assistant, Siri, Cortana, Watson are making.
need help, please
Appears to be working as desired.
But are they learning Python 2 or 3????? I'm just messing with you, sounds like a great initiative, I hope you'll keep us updated

This is a really cool project! Just one detail. One of my most negative comments, according to the tool, was part of this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/ContagiousLaughter/comments/4ukgh7/michael_richards_kramer_doesnt_like_when_his/d5relpf/ Not the whole thing, just a part that said: "You're a n*****"
This is a very good example of why such things are not so easy as they seem. When I look at the rating of some of my comments, they are completely off. Negative ones are rated positive and vice versa. Because a) the system doesn't understand context, b) it doesn't seem to understand quotes and c) it doesn't understand humor/irony.
Also the /r/learnpython sub is best for questions like this.

Thanks! If you want to subscribe to the [mailing list](http://www.pygame.org/wiki/info), I'm hoping to do a call to arms soon. We're probably going to have to build a new site from scratch, because we don't have access to the source code of the current one.

It looks like you didn't install the requests module. Type pip install requests at the command line and enter. There are tons of modules that come with python but requests is not one of them. Pip is python's package manager. Use it like above when you want to install libraries outside pythons standard libraries.
&gt; What happens to my code while using Kite? &gt; As you type, we send your code to our servers as a query. Our backend analyzes your code and generates a response by querying it against terabytes of data, i.e., all the source code publicly available on the Web. This index is simply too large to ship with each client. still no change I see :(
`cd` to the project directory and run `pip -V`. That should tell you whether pip is running from the global location or in a venv.

I'm kind of a dick. Turns out people don't like it when I point out the USA would lose a trade war with China due to the electronics market.

It seems like a really naive classifier, but it's an interesting idea. I wonder how it could be improved. Maybe training more complex model (neural network, maybe?), using the upvotes/downvotes to creta a training set.
This is super awesome!
Just curious: does this work for languages that are not English?

Oopsie.
I mean when I run command: source /var/www/mysite.net/MyProject/MyProjectenv/bin/activate and my promt changes and after that running pip -V shows: /var/www/mysite.net/MyProject/MyProjectenv/lib/python3.5/site-packages (python 3.5)
TIL: commenting in German makes you a dick. 
Heh that's funny. Hilarious "inception": https://sc-cdn.scaleengine.net/i/cfa6a13affc0fdc6996d9ca1c2297d02.png the model does not like my statement.
However, the above has become one of my most negative comments. 
Good? Not sure what you want me to do here... do you have a question? You're running a Django web application from a venv using uwsgi. So when you run uwsgi pass the parameter `-H /path/to/venv` which in your case seems to be `/var/www/mysite.net/MyProject/MyProjectenv`. See this SO answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18417823/how-do-i-run-uwsgi-with-virtualenv EDIT: Or set the venv location in the uwsgi config
[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/5cc9ea/world_chess_championship_showdown_in_new_york/d9vmbbc/) is my most positive comment? I don't think that's right.
According to the project rules, these 2 pull-requests with +20 upvotes should be already merged or at least commented why not. https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python/pull/765 https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python/pull/694
Almost half of my negative sentences come from a single comment that's a quote from Dr. Who.
I never understands the reasons to use JOOQ (except for the static compilation checking). It's just an SQL with inconsistent rules for operators and a lot of redundant punctuations symbols. It's much simple to use just plain SQL.
And name it dictiona.py! ... wait...
You could be a bot.
No, problem!

You probably don't want to use a separate named variable for each square. Think about using either a list of lists to make a 2D grid, or a dictionary keyed by square names.
you having hello.py on the python 2.7 bang and not on the python2.6 one should break things
Yay! I'm slightly positive! I see one problem. The algorythim seems to be looking for trigger words such as "Hate, war, panic, beating" and marking them as negative without context. Such as "I hate cancer" would be treated as negative. Still, as long as I'm not a dick, I'm happy! 
&gt; Analyzes your comments and lets you know if you are a dick A couple of these exist already! - `/usr/bin/true` - `/usr/bin/yes`
Sorry, it must be my limited English, but I don't understand your comment. Can you explain what you mean? I tried my hello.py with and without additional lines, to the same result.
python 2.6 starts with "#...python2.6" python 2.7 starts with "#...python2.7 hello.py" that extra "hello.py" is bad
And interestingly enough, for comparison, humans don't have amazing sarcasm detection themselves, even with context.
&gt;i don't give a fuck cunt, fuck off How on earth did this get rated positive?
You might as well have just randomized comment selections and sorted them in positive and negative.
Automation is taking all the jobs, even the job to call out people for being a dick. With all the free time we'll have we can do so many things...
I am SO HAPPY FOR YOU! (mwuhahaha)
My worst &gt;-0.9037 Jesus christ, no one on this retarded ass website has any sense of sarcasm or irony. Pretty solid analysis

Please consider posting learning related questions to /r/learnpython. Thanks!
Python makes for a great learning language, especially nowadays with things like Jupyter. Certainly better than the language they used to introduce us to programming when I was in High School, [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language\)).
yeah. some CEO's making 100's of millions is insane to me! 200k isn't too crazy imo, just very upper class
Thanks MrMagaw.
Alright, thanks.
more like: `return isinstance(sentence, str)` What a pleb you are. /s
IMO, the reason why people don't want to write SQL is because typically because it doesn't feel integrated with the language. You don't have autocompletion type checking out is declarative and feels out of place. The ORM tries to fix that by making OO code generate SQL, but there is impedance mismatch and while it might work fine with simple examples (like CRUD) it causes issues with more advanced ones, you are also missing the power of all advanced queries. I think SQL is not really an issue, and having autocompletion and type checking would be useful. I don't care about SQL being declarative, because that is what it does you tell database what you want not how you want it. 
Awesome, will have a look! Thanks
"What makes a man turn neutral?"
&gt; Wow you truly are a piece of human garbage That is one of my most positive posts. 
I am slightly positive. Nice.
So I found a sentence that the NLTK Sentiment Analyzer Vader Module thought was negative, but was actually meant as a positive. -0.6115 I am totally stealing this term. I only steal the terms that are perfect, or I'd likely not be able to devise a better one. 
I'm apparently completely neutral. It's some of those things that is listed as negative seem to be just because they include swearing
I have a django "microservice" with django-excel, which first validates the integrity of the file according to data specs stored in a configuration object (expected headers, formatting, encoding etc), and then sends it to a pyspark job that checks for specific business constraints and sends a notification back to the user. Just today more than 2000 excel files were handled and parsed successfully. in my case it's then 1 file integrity tool and some spark scripts. I don't think there could be a package covering all the business needs, and in the end it would be a lot of work to do that really. If you find something please do let me know. 
Interestingly, most of my "worst comments" are math explanations... and not really that negative.
My most positive comment was me complaining about Joe Buck, which is the best outcome I could have asked for. 
 -0.8627 bepis only disappointment and other for all a problem is not see it good to aM no used gARlic of things of those 0.7003 Sheeewp wep soup NUgGET over WATer bEPIS good very good manhy whole drinks I appreciate this.
ROFL 
You forgot to put ":" after the if statement bruh! If Cat&gt;Dog: Print("hello") Don't forget to indent (tab) the print line. Hope that helps 
I don't think it used the right comments to determine that I'm kind of a dick but it wasn't wrong. Most of my negative comments aren't really negative even without the context (which either makes them jokes or not negative at all). One of my positive sentences is actually kind of negative. Also, like aposter said, have it ignore quotes. Oddly enough two of my most positive sentences is a quote and my response to it. In total 3 of my positives aren't from me.
This is an interesting idea. I just wish the analysis was improved.
I would try using `csv.DictReader`, with colander and a few custom validators
My top 8 negative sentences are all from talking about wow lore, Sylvanas specifically. I didn't realize how rude that was.
Not at all! The word 'die' is in there too much. 
Looks like you forgot to add the `uploads` directory when you open the file. Not 100% sure that this is it but you have two places where you don't add that part to the filename.

I'm researching APIs / AI libraries for text categorization for https://www.findlectures.com, to improve the category hierarchy on software development topics. I'm looking to build a tool that can find programming languages, frameworks, etc mentioned in transcripts.
Would it help if i provided the traceback?
My second most positive comment: Imagine the joy of walking up to your friends and having the option to "Stuff into crate" on the interaction menu. I'm conflicted. 
Probably but figuring this kind of stuff out is one of the things of learning to program. Go figure it out and learn! 👍
I'm kind of a dick
Mind sharing the code?
Hey I'm "slightly positive"!
There is a problem with your Updog.
Wait is that sarcasm? I have a hard time recognizing sarcasm.
Haha, my most "positive" statement: &gt;0.9217 They're free to have their fun, but I'm also free to make fun of them.
Re: the prebuilt modules: Can you run $ pip install pygame In a virtualenv in windows, linux or mac and expect it to "just work" ? I have run a workaround "vext.pygame" that lets you use system pygame from a virtualenv, I'm hoping the prebuilt modules will make this unnecessary :) 
My second most negative comment: &gt; "I killed your cat, you druggie bitch." Lol. Thanks for this tool, I'm going to use it in arguments on Reddit form now on. "Well http://ruadick.com says you're a dick, so your point is invalid" How's that for an ad hominem attack?
Luckily for me it doesn't detect sarcasm. One of my positive comments: &gt;I find your ideas intriguing and wish to subscribe to your newsletter, because I assume it's free, poorly xeroxed, and I need to train a puppy.
Most negative comment: -0.6808 "Doot doot motherfucker" Alright yeah, I can see that. I'm blown away that you did this in half a day. 
-0.8442 was my most negative comment that said "She put together a shit load of 'goodie' bags for people in a small city who suffered loss from the recent tropical storm in Florida."
Hao dew i kil mself?
Just means you've evolved from a hydralisk, and are therefore more advanced. :)
&gt; -0.872 For example, don't go by the "every driver is out to kill you" - this provides an innate hatred towards drivers. My most negative comment. Funny! :D
&gt; -0.9473 That is fake as fuck, but here's my response if it wasn't. If I was the owner/CEO of said company, and it did cause $250M in damage, I would pay to have the guy killed. Can't really argue that one.
This is pretty cool!!
Curious what the memory footprint of your NLP model is. I'm working on a problem that's tricky to scale because the model is about 2GB in memory. I'd like to wrap it in a DRF api, but it's not at all scalable. Are you just putting your model into memory when Django starts or did you come up with another solution?
I don't save the comments or their rankings to the database. They are regenerated / reanalyzed every time someone searches a new user. I do save the user name and their overall pos/neg/neutral/compound scores to the database which I use to make the lists and rank users. I hope this helps!
I build a javascript version of this soon.
Thanks! I'll definitely have to check this out. 
/r/learnpython will get you better responses.
Various ways to achieve this. For example you could have separate programs for f1 and f2 then use cron to schedule f1.py and f2.py to run at their intervals. Alternatively you could have a master scheduler program which always runs and periodically it invokes f1() and f2() according to the schedule. 
Awesome! Thanks for the heads up!
Not that it matters here.
At one point I created a troll bot that would find the most negative sentiment comments and then quote them and reply with some randomly generated asshole remark like: &gt; ... LOL that's just not true And if they replied, it would reply back with continued negative phrases. It was hilarious to see how upset some people got, and some people wrote books in response trying to convince the bot how right they were. Found it: https://www.reddit.com/user/tobllort ~~sentience~~ lucky rolls: https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/34qk47/in_celebration_of_arizonas_first_100_day_of_the/cqxgq8f/?context=3
On the other side of the spectrum, my most positive comment was: &gt; We should encourage the alt right to devote all its efforts to this important story [*pizzagate*] - their last best hope to finally triumph over the forces of rationality. I guess I'm just naturally a positive person! 
Ah I misunderstood what was said then. Thanks.
I got very positive with a score of 26, pretty proud of that :D
Yes, e.g. "I'll spit on you, you dirty bitch" in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/comments/5e45mz/hillary_or_blood_democrats_and_postelection_angry/daa0sy9/)
You could have a endless loop with a sleep statement for f1: while True: sleep(600) f1() For f2, I would go for another enless loop that occasionally (say every second) checks the current time: from datetime import datetime while True: sleep(1) if datetime.now().time().hour == 6: f2() (the sleep(1) is technically not necessary, but it prevents the python program from taking 100% CPU power). However, I would strongly suggest cron or similar techniques over this. This is inefficient and you need to run the script as a daemon, with all the headaches that brings. It's not for nothing that in a framework like Django, it's standard to use cron or Celery for tasks like this.
Take a look at [Schedule](https://github.com/dbader/schedule).
Python standard library - sched https://pymotw.com/2/sched/ Job scheduling for humans https://pypi.python.org/pypi/schedule/0.4.2 In-process task scheduler with Cron-like capabilities https://pypi.python.org/pypi/APScheduler/3.2.0 Old StackOverflow thread http://stackoverflow.com/questions/373335/how-do-i-get-a-cron-like-scheduler-in-python
Cool. One of my negative comments: &gt; When the Child is destroyed, the future is destroyed. Sounds pretty ominous, eh? I was talking about a data structure that uses a future/promise mechanism. :-)
The undetermined number of functions isn't really a problem with cron: just let it call the python function that sorts out what other functions need to be called. But the X is also undetermined? You're sure that's absolutely necessary?
I edited the question to add the solution I found. Have a look.
Thank you, it works as intended now :) I have just to ask to user 4 inputs instead of a single one (function(args)) but it's ok. Now I will try to find a way how to launch multiple time the function without closing the script each time. Thanks again :p

Pretty low, to be honest. I had a lot of trouble doing a lot of what seemed like really basic stuff related to downloading and saving some pure-binary non-image content. The docs are really vague about how to save scraped content to a file.
Almost all my most negative comments were quoting people who were being dicks and copypastas, haha. Other than that, the website is very impressive. It would be great though if you could make quoted lines be ignored or give users the options to have them ignored since other people's words shouldn't really factor into your positivity rating. Edit: One of the worst/most negative comments I've made on reddit by far (stupid argument over Insurgency) has one of my highest positivity ratings, lol. 
I'm going to see if I can install this in blender. prior attempts: https://youtu.be/ulk1_UtNqPE 
What are those trailing question marks in `parse_isoformat`? I'm not familiar with that syntax. It it the equivelent to `try!`? Does it return an error if the expression doesn't return a successful `Result`?

Python is fun to learn and a good exercise for your brain, but I wouldn't encourage 31,000 employees to do it. The inevitable end result is going to be a lot of shadow IT that ends up causing your real IT a bunch of headaches.

&gt; /u/5225225 is slightly positive. Clearly I need to be more of a dick. Also, on the most negative comments, nearly all of them are sarcastic and not actually hostile.

We're learning C++ in my course. &gt; It's best, actually, to learn all five of Python, C/C++, Java, Perl, and LISP. Besides being the most important hacking languages, they represent very different approaches to programming, and each will educate you in valuable ways. &gt; http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html Python is a great language, but you shouldn't just learn X language, for any value of X. There are some tasks for which Python isn't suitable (or the best language), and trying to use a language for something it was not designed is a bit stupid.
Maybe this is optimization being the root of all evil, but I'm imagining that if I use cron to do this then specific functions are bound to specific machines. That doesn't scale well.
I've used validictory, which is a json schema validator for csv files in the past. Here's an example of a program that accepts a json schema config and applies it to csv files: https://github.com/kenfar/DataGristle/blob/master/scripts/gristle_validator
Visual Basic is still relevant as long as Excel exists. If you really take to it, you can be an Excel wizard for companies as many use Excel macros, which are VB based, for reports.

Sorry, I worded it wrong. I didn't mean that your case failed so much, it was mine. With my user analysis I could mostly agree with it, the same with your subreddit analysis. But I tried scraping twitter comments in Spanish, and It failed so much. That may be because people use too much irony or whatever, but I reviewed lot of outputs and I didn't feel it was accurate at all. In fact, I had the sensation that the scores tended to be neutral when I was using cases where it was obvious that the tweets were going to be really angry or something similar.

My high school didn't even have a personal computer back then. Eventually I got myself into college and took some CS courses, majored in something else, anyways they started us on with Modula2. Then we did assembly on a PDP11 emulator on a Sun workstation. At least with Fortran there are still a few jobs out there. I still don't understand using the emulator when there was perfectly good solutions running on the Sun. In any event for CS students I think Python is a stupid move and I'm a Python user. The problem with Python, from the CS standpoint, is that users don't develop and understanding of the hardware.

&gt;I finally got my bot /u/Simulate_Me_Bot off my computer and onto a server Where'd you host it? The reason I ask is because there are expensive options and cheap options. AWS is awesome for large infrastructure but you can find cheap as hell cloud computing from [lowendbox](https://lowendbox.com/) that will be close to $20 a year for something very limited. Something like this doesn't need that much resources at all. I'd consider running it off of a dirt cheap 512MB to 2GB memory instance.

SimulateMe! Jahames1
it doesn't matter what it evaluates to, the result is thrown away anyway. The point is to use shortcircuiting to only run the function under certain circumstances. A || B will return TRUE if A is TRUE, regardless of the value of B, so many languages will check the value of A, and if it is true then they won't evaluate B. The same thing for A &amp;&amp; B, if A is false, there is no reason to look at B. so the code variable &amp;&amp; function() will only run function() if variable is true. and variable || function() will only run function if variable is false. The return value of function isn't important, we never cared what the result of the logical AND/OR was, it's just a hack to only evaluate function() under certain conditions. And this soft of confusion is a perfect example of why option 2 is the correct answer.

SimulateMe! JesterOne
In my 30s. I only know Python and mainly just the standard library and things to deal with data which is what I do day to day (pandas, sklearn, statsmodel, sqlalchemy etc). He is actually younger than me by a year.
As soon as you said "the book I'm learning from says to use [Python 2.7] rather than 3.5" I knew you were using LPTHW. Do not buy into the author's bias against Python 3. I think his biggest heartburn is that you have to relearn to use "print('Hello World!')" instead of just "print 'Hello World!'". 'raw_input' is another deprecated thing you have learned already in your first 2 days, which no longer exists in Py3 (replaced by 'input'). Have you learned 'xrange' yet? That too has been dumped in favor of a revamped version of 'range'. This book does a disservice to anyone just starting with Python. Pick up any of the resources in the right hand panel here on /r/python, and start using Python 3, since you are a new learner. You will have much less unlearning that you will have to do later.

Nice! You might be interested in the /r/learnpython subreddit, if you don't know about it already. It's a great place to share your progress like this and ask questions. Keep in mind that Python 2 will not even be officially supported after 2020, and all the new features are added to Python 3. Learn Python the Hard Way is widely criticized for its insistence on the use of Python 2, among other things. The /r/learnpython subreddit maintains a list of other resources you can use [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index#wiki_new_to_programming.3F). In fact, that list doesn't even include LPTHW anymore even though it does have several Python 2 resources. You don't need to switch to Python 3 now. If you find LPTHW helpful, continue using it. You can always learn more about the differences between the two major versions later on, but it's something to keep in mind. The biggest differences you'll likely run into at this point are that `print` became a function so you need to do `print("hi")` instead of `print "hi"` and that Python 3's `input()` is Python 2's `raw_input()`.

Welcome. Beginner questions are best suited for /r/learnpython, but I will do my best to help. If you want to loop indefinitely, use: while True: [your code here] Now, let's say you want to loop until you've printed "hello" ten times. That would look like this: x = 0 while x &lt; 10: print('hello') x += 1 I hope this helps :)

Edit: /r/learnpython is the best place to get answers for you questions. The problem is with your conditionals. a == b or c is the same as (a == b) or c and because any string that's non-empty in python is 'truthy', all your if statements always evaluate to true. To express what you want to express it's either a == b or a == c or ... or a little more succinctly a in (b,c,d) For the input function you just have to massage your data so it's all in one string, input("you want to convert {0} to {1}".format(units_from, units_to)) is probably the most modern way to write that you have access to.

It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community can get disenchanted with seeing the 'same, repetitive newbie' questions repeated on the sub, so you may not get the best responses over here. However, on /r/LearnPython the community is actively expecting questions from new members, and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. Whatever your question happens to be getting help with Python, you should get good answers. If you have a question to do with homework or an assignment of any kind, please make sure to read their sidebar rules **before** submitting your post. If you have any questions or doubts, feel free to reply or send a modmail to us with your concerns. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!

Default Requests libraries won't be able to do what you want. If the request is being generated via javascript, that javascript needs to be evaluated first, and then executed. Requests has no functionality to do this. My two suggestions would be: 1. Selenium + BrowserMob Proxy: Selenium will use your browser (or a headless browser like PhantomJS) to load specific URL. It loads everything your browser does (as it uses it). BrowserMob Proxy tracks the network activity, and allows you to generate a HAR file. The HAR file can then be parsed for specific requests. 2. Scrapy + Splash: The outcome is very similar to the above. Scrapy makes the requests for all of your URL, and routes them through the Splash HTTP rendering service. Splash requests can be configured to return HAR data. In both cases, I'd also recommend implementing a white list (into BrowsermobProxy or Splash), to avoid loading a majority of irrelevant content, which should drastically speed up the entire process. Good luck!
