Are you using Python 3.7 (Newest version)? Last I saw, TensorFlow doesn’t yet work on 3.7.
Zope! I’d nearly forgotten. That and Plone were really cool.
I'm hard. 
Camalot, tis a silly ~~place~~ package :)
Requests, then shortly after, grequests. Built a tool like Brickseek that finds the lowest price for a product across all stores then outouts the page to submit a price protection claim on my credit card. Brand new GoPro $99, $700 60inch smart TV, $200. One of many of my scripts that have truly benefitted me.
I’ve done it for some libraries that take a while to import like Pandas. Or, if there is something super specific. But in general, it’s not ideal
Hot damn, I think you just solved a major kink in a document automation project I did, this could allow for full automation. At least I hope. I'll give it a test run tomorrow. 
There are libraries that I use that hit the network on import (why? Poor design) so for them I use this. Also if you're running in a constrained environment it can be worthwhile to optimize.
Here is the code btw https://github.com/theriley106/outCaptcha
There are lots of good code editors out there, but if you're new it's worth noting that any text editors will work. All you need to do is put some valid python code in a text file and run it with python. IDEs are great, but it's good to know how to write/run code without them too. 
Code please? Lovely
My reaction is the last line of the screenshot. 
crime data, tax lots, marriage/birth stuff, contract stuff, public meetings, pretty much everything is online - or should be if you are in a major populated area
Can you explain a bit why the description is misleading? And I am not sure what ads its showing, do you mind pasting a screenshot of what you see?
The arguments there are that other languages provide more bugs earlier, so therefore better. &amp;#x200B;
&gt;"There's a good language to solve a problem and it's never Python". It depends what job. If it's to get something up and running very quickly, the answer is almost always Python. If it's to have the fastest data acquisition from a device, your better off in a specific library but then wrapping Python around it. Python is slow to run, fast to develop. Most of us don't need the speeds of a corporate software. Even in a corporation, prototyping faster provides significant gains.
I don't have an answer for this but it might be better suited for r/learnpython 
I'd limit it to libraries that are slow to import. This is usually the companies internal library in my experience, so it's generally ok to do lazy import. For systems and open source packages, this isn't an issue and should be safe to import at top level. Overall, if there's no real benefit, it's a bad idea since it does make it less obvious what you're using in a file. However, if the imports are slow lor used in only a single function, then it makes sense to reduce the number of forced dependencies
Also, you should use conda for tensor flow, it's about 30% faster due to it's usage of compiled CPU routines (at least definitely for Intel)
No api token is needed for this api. Not sure why tho 
Flask 
oh okh. can u also tell me what is the use of "argparse" library in this code . i am just a beginner trying to understand ur code.
\&gt; So they can throw their temper tantrums, as far as I'm concerned. I'll be over here living my life. As long as they don't bleed too much into the Python communities and code, ruining what makes it worthwhile.
&gt;Just like you wouldn't use a hammer on a screw I would use a hammer on a screw, if I didn't expect to have to undo the screw.
I assume people think it is best form to have all the imports at the top of the file just so that it is clear what packages are in use in the file. That's the most likely answer I can imagine. I have wondered this as well, as I'm sure importing a library must take some minuscule amount of CPU that could be saved by using this "import inside of definition" pattern. Also I use tqdm sometimes as a metrics like progress bar and i often just import it in the same function definition that the loop i'm tracking is in. But then I take it out when I'm done with it so idk its not a standard pattern lmao
You would need then to be more specific about the code you run. Also, while highly unlikely, it is still possible that somehow Anaconda installer got mislabeled and regardless of your effort you are running a 32-bit version. Another, very unlikely explanation, is that your Python process starts another process that uses some 32-bit application, which does the actual work and then that application crashes.

Mine was tkinter. I made a recipe book for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. You checked what food items you have, and it said what dishes you could make with those items. Then, it linked you to the Zelda wiki page for that dish. I never added every dish and in-game ingredient. It was for a class last school year. So, I can't say it's gotten me hooked. But, it was super fun and I learned a lot.
I am no expert but have used Jupyter notebooks for creating some Python scripts in the past. My understanding is that apart from the Jupyter's magic functions (the ones starting g with % and %%) everything is 'normal' Python. Once you wrote your Python code in the notebook you can actually copy and paste the Python code into a .py file and run it outside of the Jupyter environment.
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html that sits right there at the link you have. However, if you planned to use it to convert into a grammar file for something like `yacc` or `antlr` etc, you are up for a disappointment...
Thanks will do 
sorry you had to learn matlab btw lol
I started to use this book someone suggested and I can say I haven’t actually had fun like this in awhile when it comes to academic almost feels like a really good book where you want to finish it in one night. https://www.souravsengupta.com/cds2015/python/LPTHW.pdf 
I use `hypothesis` for unit tests. It automatically generates arguments after your specifications.
Additionally you may be looking at a different rotation for each page depending on scan quality. I have used a cli tool called [deskew](http://galfar.vevb.net/wp/projects/deskew/) in the past for doing the rotations since it does a good job of guessing.
The "export" function even exists in Jupyter Notebook for this purpose :)
Yes and no. Phantom is no longer supported and uses an outdated version of Webkit but is compatible with Selenium which makes using it very easy. The Python port of puppeteer doesn't have the easiest to use API. But provides you with a powerful and much faster browsing environment. Though if you don't like writhing async code, you might not enjoy using it.

Pdfrw is a cool library. It wasn't entirely clear from examples, does it handle non-90° rotations well?
This is really something! Thank you for sharing this!
Any luck?
Could have put that in the description
For me it was pytorch! I was a C/C++ guy and always thought python was a slow and inferior language. I got into the field of deep learning last year and noticed a lot of libraries were python based (tensorflow, pytorch, etc) I thus decided to finally get into it, and boy that was the best decision of my life! Once you understand the numpy paradigm of not writing your own loops but rather working with vectors, matrices and tensors, python becomes this blazingly fast language, both to develop and to execute! &lt;3
That would be me :-)

It's just an internal project for syncing payments, calculating work hours and such. It's called Hydra because of the station from Lost. Some of our other projects are called after Flame and Swan. 
Pipelines might be a good idea though. I learned a lot of transferable knowledge building a pipeline - mostly because I decided to make the whole thing stream data to the model and augment it heavily, so there was a lot of playing around with a heavily functional approach. 
Don't call it my code @_@ you hurt me.

I think it is sensible in a function that supports a library if that happens to be installed. E.g. I've done this for objects that have a special representation when accessed in Jupyter notebooks (it has an API for this). I don't want to make my whole project depend on Jupyter, and I don't want to load Jupyter unless necessary.
I once had to use it for resolving a circular import 
Hello everyone, following [this post on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53164538/4999991), [Eric Wieser](https://twitter.com/EricWieser) was kind to implement a prototype [here](https://notebooks.azure.com/eric-wieser/libraries/numpy-integration). you may also follow the discussion [here in numpy mailing list](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2018-November/078935.html) if you will. Plus [here](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/issues/1370) I asked the Variable Inspector guys to see if they can add anything like this to the Jupyter Notebook extension.

Cool! How about when ndim&gt;2? Or for very large 2d arrays? 
First of all I should clarify that this is not my implementation and I have raised [my issues here on numpy mailing list](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2018-November/078936.html). my suggestion can be seen in [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53164538/4999991). In short the nested lists can be shown horizontally or vertically based on their dimension, even or odd respectively, contained within vertical or horizontal brackets using unicode/LaTeX/Markdown/HTML...

Again, _read the docs_ (of `bytes`, in this case)! 
that thingy that I posted is called fragment shaders, it maps 2d image to another 2d image. and because shader has access to time I can make it animated. Check out shadersbook about real glsl shaders. 3d objects mapping to screen is job for vertex shaders (as far as I know). And will try to imlement them next (this weekend probably) to create some kind of controllable 3d cube. &gt; is it hard to write? no, as long at it's naive implementation for demo purpose (I'm talking about fragment shaders, vertex are probably hard, but I don't know for sure) &gt; render game - create full blown ascii game engine, which is hard but possible. And also it will be useless) no one will want to play in ascii games. But it's still good project for portfolio (probably) or - open any game in low resolution mode and stream rendered images to image2ascii program. Streaming part might be challenging, but overall there is no fun in such approach
I use jupyter lab and vscode.
Might be amongst `openpyxl` and `sqlite3`, but I rarely use either nowadays, as I have alternatives. (Like `pyexcel`, `Xlsxwriter`, `peewee`, `TinyDB`.)
nice thanx
Scrappy.py but it's not for slowing down a site.
You have to sort this for work? Awesome. Can you do me two favours. First, can you send me some random data I can feed this for an approximation of the intended result. That way I can try clean it and check my results against the approximation. Second, can you pm me your solution and how long it took to complete? Both these favours go towards the goal of either building my confidence in my commercial skills or dismissing any fake confidence and showing me where I stand. Hope I am not asking too much. And heck, if I rise to the occasion, I will let you rip my code as payment. :P
actually i know it by using ruby...but actually i want to do it using python...actually python gives me lots of pleasure🙂
Do tell! Does Ruby have modules like python? Again though why do you want to take this site down. Consider the fact that any site hosted on a service provider is going to be resilient to basic level attacks like this. You're going to have to get a little more creative.
I think that example is a 3d array
This looks great! Unfortunately many use cases for numpy are huge higher-dimensional arrays so I'm assuming this wouldn't really be useful for that? Is there any way this can show the general structure or shape of arrays?
What would be the point in scraping data if you're looking to ddos? And yes some nice people have done this before: https://github.com/JamesJGoodwin/wreckuests
scraping data is very important...it can help me a lots of thing before doing a ddos attack🙂
OK
It's better than that: the mapping function takes two arguments, as expected for two passing two iterables, but it *fails to use the second one*. Also, the entire `reduce` call appears to just be: {'reportedTime': [*item['reportedTime'] for item in items]} I think we can safely ignore the calls to `get` in the original, since returning `None` instead of raising a KeyError is a trivial difference where you would just immediately get a `TypeError` for trying to do arithmetic with it. I'm *guessing* what `merge_dicts` does is to turn dicts `{'a': 1}` and `{'a': 2}` into `{'a': [1, 2]}`, with some detect of "lhs value is already a list".. something like this: def merge_dicts(lhs, rhs): result = {} for key, val in lhs.items(): result[key] = val if isinstance(val, list) else [val] for key, val in rhs.items(): result.setdefault(key, []).append(val) return result But it isn't smart enough to detect rhs val is a list, *or* there are other keys in there that should merge into nested lists (... with the first item not in a list, so maybe not). Unless this is overthinking it, and the `reportedTime`s are just numbers (which aligns more with them being given a keyname that isn't plural), in which case its `{'reportedTime': sum(item['reportedTime'] for item in items])}` - but.. why would you *add* (what I presume are) timestamps? And `merge_dicts` in that case could just be doing `dict.update` and expecting non-overlapping keys.. but I also can't see a situation where that kind of aggregate would make any sense at all.
Ah, I see, thanks for the info. My search for somebody using Hydra API in a serious project continues. Good luck with the refactoring!
I also do this to first start the logging in case the imports fail.
[Here in this reply on numpy mailing list](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2018-November/078933.html) I tried to adress that issue. basically in terminal one can measure the width and height and then show 4 corners and unicode 3-dots in the middles. Plus there can be U(n), D(n), L(n), R(n), UL(n,m), UR(n,m), DL(n,m), DR(n,m) to show different sides and corners. Inside IPython Jupyter one can use HTML functionalities to add vertical and horizontal sliders. I think Pandas guys have already figured most of it out. 
I think the docstring just said 90 degree increments. But I don't have the source code handy to confirm
Fully agreed. The project is for school and intended to show similarity across a large dataset (comparing each value to all other values). For now, I have just looped it to run one comparison at a time and dump the records to sql server.
Wow that’s pretty
Your ability to slow down a website is going to be limited mainly by the number of requests you can send to the target site, if you want to scrape too you can just use the normal requests library with beautiful soup 4. What did this website do to you that makes you want to slow it down?
Hey, I created a package called \[messages\]([https://github.com/trp07/messages](https://github.com/trp07/messages)) that allows for easy email creation and sending via python that could easily fit that bill. 
I’ve been working with Django for about 9 months now with my startup and have our site deployed on AWS, hmu if you’re having any trouble. A lot of the little quirky errors I’ve run into in Django seem to have outdated guides for previous versions that no longer work.

People love to shit on the languages they never bothered to learn. My view is this: if professionals are using it to develop enterprise grade products then clearly as a programming language it has a lot of value. There’s just no denying the languages usefulness, even if you don’t like it personally. Like I’ve programmed C for an extensive period of time because that’s the language we learned at my computer science degree, but I personally don’t like the language and coding in it. It’s so hard to get things done that I could do in a single line of code in python. Does that mean that C language is bad? No, obviously not, because professionals use it for enterprise grade software. If it were bad, professionals would not use it. If I were in a position to hire developers (I’m not), I would make sure they realize the usefulness of every popular language before hiring them. If they don’t, it can only be some personal vendetta against that language or just plain ignorance. 
Please, for your own sake, don’t throw python out the window because some boobs on the internet told you too. Python is an incredibly powerful language and can be used to solve a huge number of modern day software tasks quickly and effectively, anyone who tells you different is a boob.
I for one don’t love these, that said I do present coding questions when I interview so here is a list of what I am looking for when I ask an interviewee to write code live. 1. Listen carefully to the problem statements 2. Don’t get clever unless asked to 3. Hold off on explanations until you are done or asked. 4. Recognize where you are making assumptions and state what they are (ex: I am assuming the text file is ascii or utf-8 encoded to simplify reading it into a string) 5. Don’t argue the assignments. These people have watched many people do them and have likely done them themselves. 6. Do ask questions. 7. Assume you are allowed to use pretty much any standard or common tool, library, etc. Remember: these are usually more about seeing how good you are at problem solving and listening to requirements than how you actually write your code.
If you don't know another ask questions about it. It helps show you want to learn
EXACTLY! And it’s going to be completed faster in python than everywhere else
Lol “write C to improve python knowledge”. An interesting approach, but since python is built on C it makes sense!
This is subjective and just based on my experience, but I would give the following advice: As a first point: I wouldn't sweat it too much. You have a PhD and used python extensively during said PhD which probably means you are already way above the requirements for a junior position. It is also good to remember that during the interview they are not necessary interested in good and optimized or even correct code, but rather they want to know how you think and how you approach a problem. Try to talk a lot about what you are thinking when solving the problems they are presenting to you. Off course it would be better if you at the end have a clean and correct solution, but it will probably not be a huge deal if you don't. Clean is a good keyword there as well. From my experience people coming from academia often times don't write clean and nice code. Correct and fast maybe, but rarely clean. This probably comes from the fact that software in academia rarely needs to be supported long term whereas outside of academia the maintainability of your code is much more important. If you have not read the Book "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin I would recommend it. There also have been a number of blog posts written about Clean Code that summarize the book which might be enough for you. Algorithms, frameworks and libraries are also a good thing to review before the interview, but it probably only really makes sense if you already have a rough idea which frameworks and libraries they might be using or which algorithms are relevant in their specific field. If you don't know what they might be using it could just be a waste of time since there are so many algorithms and libraries out there. I would probably review some general design patterns instead if you don't know which algorithms you might expect since design patterns can help with a wide variety of problems. &amp;#x200B; Hope this helps.
I do this all the time when coding tools for 3D Software. Some coworkers dislike it but in reality this can save you from a lot of problems, for example avoid crashing the Software at startup because of one bad module import. It also avoid importing tons of custom and third party module that might never get used if the user doesn’t actually use the tool during his session by only importing when the tool is launched by the user. If it saves me problem and speed up the user experience, I do it. Coding conventions are more a guideline anyway :)
Thank you for your time! I got a bit worried as during the online interview I was asked very simple comp-sci stuff I'd never heard about, and while I feel my python skills are solid I used it alone on a specific problem, as opposed to in a larger commercial software development context. In short; I'm not so confident :) A few other things if you'd be so kind: Any opinion on the common talked about coding challenges like fizzbuzz etc? I also have information on their full stack, most of which I have no experience in. I'm now somewhat familiar with how these different technologies interact, but that's about it. Should I spend some time learning more technical details about them? Thanks again for your time! 
Logged in specifically to say what /u/tomz17 said [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9ujma0/is_it_commonacceptable_to_have_an_import/e94x8ma/), but he beat me to it. So I'll just say, "wot he said" and give him an upvote. (And one for you, for asking a good question.) Oh, and he didn't mention circular imports, which is another reason to do this. (Module A imports B, but B has to directly or indirectly import A.) But better to redesign your code to avoid the circular import, if you can. 
I put the clever in quotes to mean what you meant. They write the most cryptic code on one line instead of writing simple code over 5 lines. They think they're being clever. 
Before I waste a bunch of time I can't afford to lose on another dumb video on something I don't give a shit about, how about you tell us what the KNN algorithm is and why we would care about it? 
Well, this post is specifically about the @property decorator and not about decorators in general. However, I stand corrected if the description tried to imply that the @property decorator is something that is always 'needed'. I have rephrased that bit.
I’m sorry, would this be better suited on r/learnpython?
Its not misleading. I don't understand what /u/metaleverlconsulting is trying to say. The sentence is talking about ``property`` which is (typically, but not compulsorily) applied as a decorator. So the sentence is correct: "the property decorator lets a method to be accessed as an attribute instead of as a method with a '()'" is correct: - `property` **is a decorator**; - and it does exactly what you say it does. I cannot imagine anyone reading that and concluding that "all decorators, no matter which one, let methods be accessed as attributes without the parens".
&gt; Quick question Quick answer. Downvoted for lack of sensible title. 
No, there is no standard for Python like there is for Javascript or Java. Python is defined partly by its documentation, and partly by its "reference implementation", CPython (the one you almost certainly are using). Just don't ask what happens when the behaviour of CPython contradicts the documentation... (That could be a documentation bug, or a software bug, or both...) There are alternate implementations, like Jython, IronPython, Nuitika, PyPy, Stackless, MicroPython, and others. You can implement Python the language in any way you like, so long as you follow the documented/reference behaviour.
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
What version of Python are you using? In 3.5, the value of the string is printed: py&gt; float('a') Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'a' Even Python2.7 does similar, but it doesn't show the quotes. So it could be that you have a bunch of whitespace: # Python 2.7 py&gt; float(' ') Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; ValueError: could not convert string to float: 
Selenium WebDriver is the tool for the job. Should be very easy!
&gt; This version is indeed faster than yours at larger sizes. I started to see a difference around 10,000 elements. I don't. I ran your merge function up to two x lists of a million elements each, and `sorted()` was still significantly faster. At two lists of 10,000 elements, `sorted` blew your merge out of the water. At two lists of a million elements each, the difference was closer, but still significantly in favour of `sorted`. Which is what I would expect... I wouldn't expect anything written in pure Python to beat `sorted` until you had millions or tens of millions of items. (Unless the comparisons between items were unusually expensive.) But of course, YMMV.
Now there's a name I haven't heard in a very long time. How many people use it for *new* projects?
How do you assert against specific results without dogfooding? Or do you just assert against features of the result, like the range of the function?
Trying to figure out how to put together a program that would retrieve data from separate access databases based on my input. Any people experienced with that topic? any links/readings would be appreciated
First, select the level of performance you want to hit, and profile your code to see if you are far from that level. I wanted one of my CLI tool rewrites to work as fast as Bash version of same tool and I noticed that if I'm just printing help and exiting, the "import ssl" statement took bulk of my time, so I moved it to the function that actually did work. In CLI tool that runs once and exits this is fine, not sure this would be a good idea in a library. To conclude - select performance level you want, see if you can reach it and profile to see if imports take up any significant time :) 
you can begin with videos, that help me a lot
&gt; I feel my python skills are solid I used it alone on a specific problem This is what I expected. I hired people that came from an academic context in Physics, Linguistic or Philosophy and they where solid hires for the (non junior) Developer positions we hired them for. They all worked (mostly) alone on specific problems during their time in academia that where not related at all to what we do (aviation software), but that was never a problem really. When hiring a Programmer of any level a certain amount of learning and familiarization is absolutely expected. Possibly months if there is a significant large or complex codebase that you need to familiarize yourself with. The fact that they might have gaps in there CS knowledge was also not really a problem. That is (mostly) my job as the Lead Developer with a purely Programming and Software Architecture background. &gt;Any opinion on the common talked about coding challenges like fizzbuzz etc? Fizzbuzz and Binary Search and the like are very simple challenges. They are used to test if you can program at all. It could be useful to try Fizzbuzz or other "[Code Kata](http://codekata.com/)" style challenges once just learn that these are not difficult, but I would not prepare for these specifically since there just are too many possibilities they could ask. For these challenges the comment from tletnes above applies: Listen to the problem carefully, ask questions, recognize and communicate any assumptions you make. &gt;I also have information on their full stack, most of which I have no experience in. That is great. Depending on how much time you have to prepare it can be useful to do some tutorials or try their stack out on some small project. I wouldn't necessary jump into deep technical details, but I would try to learn how to use the central technologies of their stack in a basic way. 
Flask is installed system-wide, and you're using a virtual environment. Install Flask in your virtual environment.
That's not how it works. Your first argument should be a list of command + arguments.
Recommend this. When using \`docker build\`, it can speed up the process by a lot. 
Do you have your testing code? I provided a link to a comparison of the two approaches, where you can run the testing code online, so people could see an objective comparison. You can see it [here](https://repl.it/repls/ThankfulAcceptableCodegeneration). Here's what I got just running it there: list length: 10000 iterations: 50 merge_sorted_1 1.1992929430016375 merge_sorted_2 1.6238001860001532 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- list length: 100000 iterations: 5 merge_sorted_1 1.4770410110031662 merge_sorted_2 4.59858641900064 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- list length: 1000000 iterations: 1 merge_sorted_1 3.301110747997882 merge_sorted_2 13.742783189001784 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Of course, most things written in pure Python will be pretty slow, but we're talking about a linear traversal verses a sort. `n` vs. `n log n` is still a factor of ~13 difference for 10,000 elements, not even including the hidden constant factors (which are going to be much higher for a sorting algorithm than a merge). If you provide your testing code (ideally on [repl.it](https://repl.it/) or something similar so we cut out the machine differences) then we'll have more to talk about, but with what you've given I don't know how you got those numbers.

I don't think the metric of "professionals use it to write enterprise applications in" is terribly useful. Perl used to pass with flying colors on that metric. Now nobody uses it and everybody looks down on it. Strictly speaking you can write enterprise software in lots of languages. It doesn't mean it's a good idea.
If I understand your comment, kdialog is a valid executable command on this Arch system with KDE. The three arguments shown are each enclosed with a single apostrophe and followed by a comma.
You're passing your command as multiple arguments. It should be a single argument, which is a list containing your program name _and_ all the arguments. Like this: `subprocess.run(['kdialog', '--title', 'Test Dialogue', '--passivepopup' ...`
Appreciate your time! I'll have to take it slow and hope I manage to come across as somewhat competent :)

If you are using IPython you can [register your own formatter](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/integrating.html#formatters-for-third-party-types) so you don't have to call `make_pretty` yourself. This is for example what [`disp`](https://github.com/ipython/disp) does for some core objects. One of the advantage is that it does not need to be implemented in Numpy itself, you can choose between representations, and it will work with old versions. In JupyterLab I would suggest a custom mimetype and mimeformatter, for high flexibility.
You are still doing it wrong. All of your non-named arguments need to be inside a list. 
I would start by giving CHMOD the root folder to 777. Then I would change your line to: os.makedirs('to_upload/'+nome_immagine, exists_ok=True)

I've tried both options, but because i have to run python2, exists ok doesn't work, i also tried making folders 777 but nothing...it's weird because it throws this error only when i run it as a service
I really appreciate your POV. There's somewhat accurate - I worked in statistical genetics and am now applying for a job developing software for a data science company. I haven't really had a look at these coding challenges - I tried a few which were fairly simple, but maybe I'll try some of the harder ones! My big worry is coming across a problem or concept I have no experience in, and as I said my knowledge is somewhat narrow. I have two days to prepare so not a great deal of time, but I'll have a good look! Thanks again for your time. 
Yeah, I think it was a bunch of whitespace, but the error was in the feature, not in the label, which is what was throwing me off as I was looking at the labels given the error was saying it was in column 6 (which is where the label was). I was able to find it, but it took a while. Thank you for the response though!
I appreciate your patience. I had not included the brackets [ ] before. I think all of the non-named arguments are inside the list, shown below. Now it has a syntax error: &gt;&gt;&gt; import os, sys &gt;&gt;&gt; import subprocess &gt;&gt;&gt; subprocess.run(['kdialog', '--title', 'Test Dialog', '--passivepopup', 'This is a test message in KDE...', '10', shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)] SyntaxError: invalid syntax Sorry, I am not understanding why this will not work, or why I am not understand your directions.
I see, I have done something similar before. It was a simple python script that needed to run 24/7 uninterrupted, I used supervisord, which can be easily installed using apt, this tool allows you to run your scripts automatically on boot and restarts them if they crash (very useful for discord bots). It is very easy to set up, it will require that you create a config file.
Okay i will try this solution if i can't get rid of this error, anyway thank you! :)

There are a quite a few Companies that are still basing their core business on TurboGears and a few relatively big opensource projects that recently moved to it: That I'm aware of - The Kallithea SCM https://kallithea-scm.org/ - The Virgilio Monitoring Framework: https://www.vigilo-nms.org/ - Fedora Packages https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages It's probably not as famous as Flask, but has it's great place as a more flexible Django and has more batteries included than flask. I think it's still one of the few (if not the only) framework that has an autogenerated Admin for MongoDB. 
Non-named arguments go inside the list, named arguments like `shell=True` go outside the list, and the closing paren goes last, not before the square bracket. 
Just got to work on this. And all of you were right: IT DOES NOTHING
This is name mangling. It is done to prevent overwriting conflicting names on subclasses. It is still there. Try: print(p._Person__born)
&gt; not even including the hidden constant factors (which are going to be much higher for a sorting algorithm than a merge). Your assumption about constant factors is probably wrong: sorted does all its work in highly optimized C code, almost certainly one or two orders of magnitude faster than the interpreted Python code you have, so its constant factors are probably 10-500 times *smaller* than your merge function. As far as the test code goes, I did the simplest thing that could work: build two lists, start a timer, merge, stop the timer: from merge import merge # your merge function from random import random a = [random() for __ in range(10000)] b = [random() for __ in range(10000)] a.sort(); b.sort() with Stopwatch(): c = sorted(a + b) with Stopwatch(): d = merge(a, b) assert c == d The Stopwatch context manager can be found [here](https://code.activestate.com/recipes/577896-benchmark-code-with-the-with-statement/?in=user-4172944).

You're still doing it wrong. You need to have your arguments separately from their names, as I posted before.

By the way, `O(n log n)` for sorting is *average case*, not best case. Best case for Timsort is `O(n)`, and it is highly optimized for sorting runs of partially sorted data (which is precisely what your merge function requires to work), so we're going to get `O(n)` here. Given two runs of sorted data, Timsort will effectively merge them, but in C code instead of Python. There's some overhead which your function doesn't have: - we have to build a single list, which is `O(n)`; - Timsort has to find the runs first, which it does in `O(k)` time per run, where k is the length of the run; (and in this case, there are exactly two runs); but since both of those happen at C speed, even with the overhead, merging via Timsort is likely to be faster than merging in pure Python until you have a lot of items. I don't doubt that for "sufficiently large" N, your merge will win. But I'm suspicious about any test showing "sufficiently large" is as small as 10000 as that doesn't match my experience.
What do your Perl scripts do?

Can you run the same command in the shell and get the expected result? Is the `'10'` at the end part of the command?
Thanks
Thank you, appreciate the tip
This command in bash correctly launches the dialog: kdialog --title "Test Dialog" --passivepopup "This is a test message in KDE..." 10 Yes the 10 is part of the command arguments. There is no manual for kdialog, but the kdialog source code lists this for the parser (if that helps): parser.addOption(QCommandLineOption(QStringList() &lt;&lt; QLatin1String("passivepopup"), i18n("Passive Popup"), QLatin1String("text&gt; &lt;timeout")));
Make it pass the Turing Test. ;)
Not going to write the app for you but: To get input from terminal: `name = input("What is your name?")` `age = int(input("How old are you?"))` To repeat something 4 times: `for i in range(0,4):` Arithmetic: `ans1 = 2*2 #4` `ans2 = 3+2 #5` Out: `print("Hello, Monty!")` 
Remove `shell=True` from your arguments.
Sorry, I meant "constant factors" in the sorting algorithm, not the implementation. "Constant factors" is actually probably the wrong term: I was referring to the hidden extra linear and sub-linear terms not included in the big-oh complexity, of which timsort (which is the algorithm used in CPython, AFAIK) has several. In the merge algorithm, the extra terms include a few steps inside the loop, and the array resizing (with the appends). For timsort, you've got several expensive steps to find runs and so on. My guess was that the differences here would *outweigh* the difference in speed between C and Python (which I would put at like 1000-ish). Anywho, I'm surprised (and a little disappointed, to be honest) to see that I'm wrong about that, and that `sorted` is so much quicker! I suspect that the function call overhead of `next` might be a big cost centre, but I don't have time to check other implementations right now. I suppose there's also a large chance I could never beat `sorted`with a merge in pure Python. Ah, well. Just to be totally pedantic, I should also point out that your implementation isn't the same as OP's (which is what I was comparing mine to). Also, I assume yours is much faster than OP's, for a couple reasons. Firstly, you don't construct 3 sets, and merge 2 of them. This saves some work, but also it doesn't remove duplicates. I'm not sure if OP had to remove duplicates (the question isn't super clear on this point), but the `merge` function I wrote did (well, it removed duplicates between the two provided lists, but not within them, if that makes sense). Secondly, your `sorted` call is on two already-sorted lists concatenated together: timsort actually just performs a single merge in this case, recognising two runs. So it actually ends up being linear thanks to that! Another sorting algorithm (introsort, as is in the C++ std lib, for instance) wouldn't be so lucky.
Its assigned to the special member `__doc__`. However if you place it elsewhere (not below a function, class or module definition) it will be dropped right after being picked up as you described it.
Yeah, all of that seems spot on. I am curious to see if I could leverage the `sorted` method *and* remove duplicates while keeping the same speed.
Not just any C... you need to know C to understand what problems where CPython authors trying solve, why those problems existed, this will also explain the motivation behind solutions.
For large 2d arrays, I'd hope it would follow the same rules as np.set_pintoptions. For 3d, well loadtxt fails for that, but my hope would be, something like when arrays print, so: (a, b, 0, 0) ... (a, b, 0, 1) ... (a, b, 0, 2) ... then just stick the table into ...
Don't post /r/learnpython stuff here. I just answered your question.

Digital forensics? You will need to know programming and scripting, as this field uses them heavily. I wholeheartedly suggest you seriously get into it instead of asking for help with trivial things online. Read course notes and materials, find some Python tutorials and practice. Programming is very important in forensics. If you neglect it, you will not be able to do anything later on.
I don't know how many people use it. My personal reasons for choosing it over its competitors is that it's at the sweet spot of flexibility and "batteries included". As a bonus, it happens to include batteries which I like rather than inventing its own, e.g. SQLAlchemy as the ORM and Genshi/Kajiki templates.
Do you know how it compares with Pyramid?
Yup. It is. Sorry.
Lol the edit sounds like sth from Rick and Morty! 
That is not a good way of validating. Greylisting will reject after RCPT TO or maybe even reject the connection after HELO. Also, you have no guarantee that the address is associated with the user that just entered it.

I have indeed issues a feature request on Jupyter extension variable inspector and you may see it [here](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/issues/1370). I was not aware of Spyder's variable explorer. it seems like a great toil and it already has some table visualization for numpy arrays. I will try to ask them to looking into this idea. Thanks.
&gt; but then you added the explicit event loop nonsense out of place making zero sense Note the quotation marks. It's from the Zen of Python.

When you run your script as a service current working directory is automagically changed to / during double-fork, unless defined otherwise. With relative path like yours, script will try to create a directory `/to_upload/+nome_immagine` and regular user have no write permission to /. Use absolute path. 
&gt; why it was implemented this way Because Python is an explicit language. "Explicit is better than implicit" is from the Zen of Python. It's why we have to manually pass `self` as the first argument to every method instead of the language doing it implicitly. 
I was shure i was missing some stupid point. Thank you so much sir! :) Should i delete this post or?
First, try if absolute path works. Maybe the problem is somewhere else. If it works, say it's OK and leave the post for other people with the same issue. BTW, think what happens when `nome_immagine` contains `/../` or `/../../`, then read about `os.path.abspath()` and maybe `os.path.join`. Validate inputs.
I just started experimenting with Docker yesterday and `pipenv install --system` worked fine. No need to generate a requirements.txt.
I just finished making a program to automatically download and upload my files to google sheets from any computer that I use. I did this because I have a cheap laptop and like to use my school's desktop computers for heavier tasks but don't like transferring files.
Thank you very much 
Can you please explain more what you mean by validating the address and what do you mean by deliverability 
It is a very good idea if you have an internal variable that should never ever be accessed from the outside, because it clearly documents that this variable should not be accessed that way. In the case of your example, you should turn __born into a property ```python @property def born(self): return 2018 - self.age ```

I made a quick program using MoviePy that combines clips together quickly, allows for trimming and adds background music. It's most useful for replay montages for gaming or fast video editing. Just gotta figure out how to make it to an exe, since it's being a little difficult.
Are you thinking of something like [this](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/)? Even if there's something already out there, it might be a fun and useful exercise to go through yourself anyways. I always find I learn better by doing rather than reading. 
Cool idea! there is always a lot of boilerplate code with UI modules, so this is nice :) keep it going!
&gt; So the sentence is correct: "the property decorator lets a method to be accessed as an attribute instead of as a method with a '()'" is correct: it's correct but not complete: the property decorator also allows one to program arbitrary behavior when assigning to an attribute, e.g: myobject.age = 42 # and behind the scenes the decorated attribute does whatever it pleases.
Any of the O'Reilly books as well as The Quick Python book published by Manning.
&gt; to a function a decorator is a callable that returns a callable - this is the most general definition.
Obviously, there are modules that do this for you already, like PyCrypto and PyCryptodome, _but_ it’s still a lot of fun to look into the implementation of crypto protocols and stuff like that. There are RFCs for RSA, for example, that you can read and implement an RSA cipher of your own! Good luck!

It's interesting to know the alternatives to the standard `json` library. I'll admit that I rarely second-guess using it, sometimes to run into performance issues later. However I feel like this article is a missed opportunity, because it does not address the issue of _safely_ using that JSON data in the code. Assumptions leading into `KeyError` and `ValueError` are the bane of my work life, so it's a pet peeve of mine to be strict about validating and de-serializing that data. IMO, that makes a world of difference when maintaining that code much later.
Yes, right! But my thinking was you would have to install pipenv on the container which is unnecessary overhead, when the `--system` flag just uses pip under the hood.
The last number in range() is not included in the list. I think you need to use range(0, 1+1) in your inner loop.
The official tutorial is a good starting point. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html
Can you make a video about your project and then use the project to make a montage of it? :) Sounds cool
This past weekend I was part of a hackathon team, we used a RPi0w to connect to an android phone over Bluetooth and talk to an Arduino over USB. Pretty cool to get working and I got to teach a first time "hacker" python! List comprehension is always fun
https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/generator https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/04/07/improve-your-python-yield-and-generators-explained/ Read through that second link specifically, it may give a little bit insight into how you could do this. 
&gt;Hi Cedric, &gt; &gt;thanks for the Advice. I Altered the Code accordingly: &gt; &gt;for i in range(0,3): for j in range(0,i+1): print(j) print(i) &gt; &gt;Unfortunately this does not work. Now the result looks like: &gt; &gt;000110122 &amp;#x200B;
I didn't know [an entire website](http://stackoverflow.com) could be created in Python simply by recursively calling a function 1000+ times with or without tail call optimizations . Awesome. ;) &gt; Which your phone will always want to correct to "memorization" LOL 
Can you check your indentation? I tried your original for-loop and got the answer you were requesting: Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48eceb, Dec 19 2017, 06:54:40) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(0,3): ... for j in range(0, i): ... print(j) ... print(i) ... 0 0 1 0 1 2

I wouldnt trust anything asyncio in production. 
Looks interesting, thanks!
You are Right, that there was an error in my indention. And that was it. Thank you very much, I was a stupid person. But still there is much to learn and the next thing are generators ;) &amp;#x200B;
I’m guessing he means whether the address has valid syntax verses actually able to receive messages 
That's OK... I'm willing to wait. And, yes, the contact_list sample on master has been updated to use this feature, so you should just be able to run it.
What module is calling sqlite3? Also you can just change your PATH to whatever you need it to be.
It's a script I'm writing. I have sqlite 3.25.0 binary in /usr/local/bin/ AND in my local venv/bin folder. sys.path shows the local venv/bin folder first. But when I open the python shell with the venv activated, import sqlite3 print(sqlite3.sqlite_version) outputs 3.11.0.

Any specific reason?
Important note: '*could'*, not '***will***'. It also adds overhead, which may slow you down by more than what you've gained through parallelization. &amp;#x200B; There's already a bunch of numpy in there, so taking advantage of vectorization may be an option (I noticed there's a nested for-loop in set\_pixel, which seems like something that could be replaced with a vectorized operation on a 2D matrix just at a glance), and something like Numba might help as well.

When you're asked a question in an interview, there are actually two questions. The first question is what they're asking (e.g. how would you do this), the second question is "How easily can I see myself working with this person?". Answering the second question is probably more important than the first. &amp;#x200B;
I'm very confused about this workflow, why wouldn't you develop with docker too? I feel like most of advantages of docker is lost by workflow like this.
"Fluent python" could pick your interest. 
It's not a link. It's the Discord python API
I have my python programs that I'm working on uploaded on it, to my knowledge Google won't run these program on their servers for free so I would need to download it to run it anyways. It also allows me to view the code in sublime instead of as plain text.
KNN is like one of the most widely used nearest neighbor algorithms...why don't you google what it is and see if its relevant to you? 
The default mode of asyncio is "footgun" (see: protocols making it incredibly easy to DoS yourself, requiring specific care when writing to streams to make sure you actually wrote stuff).
Some dithering would help a lot.

Pandas has already absorbed a lot of spreadsheet workflow. Seeing it integrating w/ some cool excel features (PowerMaps comes to mind) would be a boon!

The easiest way to use a non-system-wide installed module is to use a virtualenv. http://charlesleifer.com/blog/compiling-sqlite-for-use-with-python-applications/ 
Some things I noticed: You used camelCased variables. Since this is not the default for python you should not do this in a tutorial. You don't explain why the "A |B" is used for unions (elements either in A or B). So this might seem quite random to the reader. Your examples for set comprehensions don't show anything useful. Perhaps take an example from mathematics. I would actually refrain from using discard. Explicitly catching the error and reacting to it is mostly what you want to do. The disadvantages of e.g. frozenset are actually advantages, since you can't accidentally change the values. Using mutability without knowing the repercussions is a common cause for hard to find errors in code. Especially amongst data scientists. One can also use them as dictionary keys.

True but when sharing with non programmers excel is the go to programs as it let the non programmers easily edit the data themselves for example graphs pivots etc.
I honestly don't see any use of excel!! R is a WAYYYY better option
I completely agree for the most part, but excel is still the go to program to share data with non programmers! Therefore, being able to manipulate excel through python before sharing it with non programmers would be great!!
True that. Guess i just demonstrated how selfish and self centered programmers can be lol. 
This was never an Alembic issue but rather SQLite not supporting all schema changes. Thankfully there are workarounds, just requires a bit more code.
A couple of years ago [I looked at JSON alternatives in Python](https://nelsonslog.wordpress.com/2016/01/10/a-better-python-object-for-json-take-2/) to deal with missing values. I tried `ddict`, `easydict`, `dotmap`, and `attrdict`. In the end I didn't really like any of them. I just use the stock `json` module but am sure to call `data.get(key, {})` instead of `data[key]` solely so I'm always controlling what value I get for a missing key.

* You should name your `pixelate_main.py` `__main__.py`. then `python -m pixelate` will work. * Why a main function? Can one call this in any meaningful way? Just put the arg parsing in the `if __name...` block. * Make a function you can call with arguments `file_path` etc. instead. * Put the functions in `__init__.py` instead.

&gt; how to implement a decorator with arguments specifically an instance-binding correct one - way too many decorators around only work on either unbound functions or bound methods, the latter usually just tacking a self arg on the wrapper whether or not it's a method and the former getting more args than expected when used on instance methods. a single impl can do both, either manually via descriptors or already done for you through a lib, but it's tragically uncommon (and hence imo a decent detail for your list :)
Way back when I used to use vbscript to populate excel spreadsheets for various tasks -- like device inventory.
Your token is still in your commit history. They’re looking at past commits to get the token. You need to eradicate that string from your entire git history (BFG can do this) or delete this repository and create a new one, this time using environment variables like others have mentioned. 
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
Hey Al! Just FYI if you use shortlinks, your posts go automatically into the spam filter. No way for moderators to get around it. If possible, we recommend not using them. (I'll obviously approve them when i see them, but if you wonder why things might look removed sometimes, this may be why)
Ack! Thanks for the heads up.
For me the thing that really changed how I understand python and programming is - playing with other languages such as Go and Haskell. Go because it is a clear static imperative language without OOP but with high level features such as concurrency. and haskell because it is beautiful functional language that python and other languages have borrowed from. - reading design patterns book by the big four, practically most of OOP languages just integrate this into their standard or most popular libraries. - reading language specification of python, they go into great detail and some things can surprise you. Also the docs in general have many great recipes by this point, see zip and decorators - reading cpython on github for specific built ins can be very illuminating. You will notice that everything in python is an object and object composition and reference/dereference are how things are done. This will in turn explain the mechanics of weird syntax in python. - you can find practical guides on abcmeta and decorators easily. Frankly they have a bad interface in python, even JavaScript does this better. If you want to play around with types Declaration and function composition I would suggest another language, such as JavaScript to play with closures etc - check scope and namespaces, nonlocal global keywords.
Only think I can think is to set up an Android phone to run Linux and then a cronjob to run a python file. Maybe it tweets whenever it stops charging? You need to have internet when you have no power (cell network) and you need to have some sort of sensor to recognize when the power has ACTUALLY gone out. 
Hey, thanks! I appreciate the encouragement :-) Trying to bring GUIs to everyone. Perhaps now beginners can get in on the Qt fun. 
Documentation being a first-class part of a language is a beautiful thing.
huh, TIL, thanks!
Can you go into a bit more detail about this process? This is super interesting!!! Some of my project ideas involve cross communicating like this so I'm really interested in how this will worked out for you.

Hey Good Folks! I’m new to Python, currently learning by reading ‘The Self Taught Programmer’ and working through Pluralsight’s Python path. I feel I’ve gotten comfortable enough with Python’s syntax, Functions/Methods, Classes, etc. to try my hand at a personal project. I want to make a simple personal finance app that will keep track of all my subscriptions/bills, and remind me when which bills are due, by displaying the amount of the bill and the logo associated with whatever company is billing me. I want to start by making this program run on my PC, but I’d like to eventually develop this program into an iOS/Android app, so I can use it on my phone. I’d appreciate any advice from my fellow Pythonistas regarding how to attack creating that functionality, or tools/libraries this may be a good time to learn. 
Oh my bad guys

Wrapping up another Flask project. It’s for my clan in Destiny 2. I pull data from the API from every pvp match our members have ever played, and I use database queries to display things like: total kills for each weapon(and the amount of kills each player contributed to the total count), top weapons for every weapon category, etc. 
Reading or watching anything produced by Raymond Hettinger provides entry points to a deeper understanding of Python. He covers lots of topics and provides lots of code examples which have inspired design decisions toward developing python into a more capable language.

Hello r/python! Ariadne was created at Maumee (of [Saleor]([https://getsaleor.com](https://getsaleor.com)) fame) to scratch our internal itch and making Python dev experience for GraphQL more familiar to what our frondend/node.js crew is doing with Apollo, making it easier to share knowledge, and tap into an existing body of resources and We are already dogfooding Ariadne internally at few projects and microservices, we've also got plans further improving Ariadne based on internal feedback that we've turned into [Github issues](https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne/issues) for everyone to still and be able to chill on. Having Django as a tool of the trade, we'll also be following up with sister project offering Django view and utilities for working with caching and ORM, but there's no concrete timetable or roadmap yet. We love to hear what you think about it! Thanks!
This site is a goldmine! I haven't seen articles with such eloquence.
I've been a fan of what I've seen with PySimpleGUI! Since I'm a heavy Qt user, this gets me excited! If I can make some of the simpler portions of my GUI's with this or maybe use this for prototyping something quicker that'd be great. There's always a bunch of boilerplate when building simple Qt stuff. Only hangup I have at first is that I'm on PyQt5 rather than PySide2.
While tools like PyCharm help a lot, a project also needs organisation and documentation and tests and conventions to help understand. We use a [table of contents to organise tests and Puml diagrams](https://www.reahl.org/docs/4.0/devmanual/sourcecode.d.html#making-sense-of-code) for us to make sense of our own code. I once played with the idea to write diagrams using Python, in such a way that what can be inferred from code **is** (like inheritance), but that you can omit classes that aren't relevant and augment a diagram with relationships and perhaps planned classes that don't exist yet. We wanted a text format so we could diff versions. The idea was also to run them as tests that break if they get out of date. It looked something like this (assuming classes from your code are A, B, C, D, BA and BB): Diagram( 'omitting classes from a tree shows up in greyed out edge', BA, BB, (A, '1..* &lt;-- 1..* : label of a relationship', C), (D, '--', C) ) The first line is a text description of what the diagram is about. It is followed by a list of classes you want included, augmented by tuples representing relationships. I would then generate a visual diagram with graphviz. Unfortunately I did not have time to pursue this. &amp;#x200B;

Been working on my toy language project, Akilang, using Python and LLVM: https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang The whole thing's basically an experiment to see how much of a language, and to what degree of success, I can implement by way of those tools. I'm finding the main limitations aren't Python or LLVM, but my own understanding -- but hey, enhancing my own understanding is also what this is all about. I've made only marginal progress in the last month (many other things going on), but I'm slowly figuring out details of how to handle things like automatic memory management and exception-style error handling. If you're on Windows, you can pull and try out Akilang right now, with some demos (e.g., Conway's Game Of Life). I'm also working on a "Robots" game demo, which is now playable.
I've been working on a framework for executing commands cross- platform on remote hosts. run_cmd(server, 'hostname') would auto detect platform (unix/windows) and SSH/WinRM the command on the host and return stdout and stderr. We have pre-defined credentials we store encoded based on a unique salt to each user and decide when attempting to authenticate. We cache encoded creds for each server to skip this step later.
Search in the comments, it must be there :) 
Example? Tacking a self decorator as in a class?
oh no
&gt; This is source code I got from my high school teacher. How about you ask the teacher then? Or check that you copied it correctly? You probably have a class full of people who got the same code, does it fail for *everyone* or just you? I see three problems: SyntaxError: `selection%` is not valid. NameError: "INPUT" should be spelled in lowercase "input". TypeError: you are passing two arguments to the input function, but it only takes one. I predict that you copied the code wrongly, and it should be: selection = input('Enter your selection') 
Yes, docstrings are special: string literals that immediately follow a class, a function (or method), or appear at the top of a module are copied into the `__doc__` attribute of the object. It was surprisingly hard to find documentation for this fact, but I found it here (only because I already knew about `__doc__`): https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html?highlight=__doc__ Or at the interactive interpreter, you could call `dir()` on various functions and classes, notice that they have a `__doc__` attribute, print `obj.__dir__` and draw the obvious conclusion. Don't underestimate the power of interactive exploration at the REPL. 
........What do you want to automate?
Sorry, you're complaining that *a single introductory sentence* isn't "complete"? What, do you expect the poster to explain every single nuance and feature of both property and decorators in general in a single sentence? &gt; the property decorator also allows one to program arbitrary behavior when assigning to an attribute That one sentence doesn't explain the complete behaviour of property, you didn't mention that you can also program arbitrary behaviour when deleting the attribute, or that you can specify a docstring, or explain the various helper methods that property objects include, or the way to use property as a function instead of a decorator. Total fail!!!1! /s 
Why should I have to google it because the poster is too lazy to include a description to go along with the title? They don't have to give a full, comprehensive explanation, but they can explain just enough so that readers can tell if they're interested or not. Of course they are entitled to be as lazy as they like, and I'm entitled to bitch about it and down-vote the post. 
The arduino library runs on the side of the arduino. You compile it with the rest of your arduino code and upload the whole thing; the python code doesn't need (or want) to know about what libraries the arduino is using.
uhh, it's already avaiable in powerBI so should be fine
I’m trying to do this exclusively in python, not arduino. 
I don't know of a way to upload Python code to the arduino, but GL I guess. Mostly a noob too :p
As far as I know, you have to create binding between Python and C++. There are tools for doing it: [Boost.Python](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_67_0/libs/python/doc/html/index.html) , [Swig](http://www.swig.org) , [ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/ctypes.html). For one class, using only [C/API](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/) may be enough.
There is no good use for private variables. It's a mistake in language design. Once people thought it was a good thing, but they learned it's worthless (as in has some downsides and no upsides). Specifically, people thought that objects could represent program modules and to allow some sort of separation between different domains, but then they realized that there are problems with inheritance: it is not always clear whether you want to inherit private properties or not. It also prevents one from creating federations of entities that all share something that the rest of the world doesn't.
The problem is, the library was meant to run on the arduino, so just porting the functions to Python won't work. OP needs to call these functions on the arduino, not his PC
Yeah, I'll put it on my list of stuff to do, hopefully can link it here within a couple days. Here's the github for it: https://github.com/joncady/highlight_generator for now. Thanks for commenting on this!

You probably want a Micropython board instead, because I don't think what you are trying to do is possible. Python (AFAIK) can't be run on Arduinos, and Arduino code typically can't be compiled for PC usage. Probably with some tweaking you could make it work, but it might be easier to just find another implementation.
Been tossing around ideas about doing some more work on a CRUD app I made in Flask to brush up on best practices or making a web scraper to get details of some jobs on Indeed. I think I'll probably go with doing a little more work on the CRUD app since it seemed to impress some recruiters when I was looking for an internship. I'll just be brushing up on my Python skills in general since I'm using it in my internship! Hopefully it's not 2.7 :)
Gotta love the irony here of the bot chiming in
Pyramid is a non opiniated framework. You bring all your own batteries. TG2 with its gearbox toolkit brings faster but more opiniated bootstrap. 
Its a question, I was wondering so I could refer him to what I used depending on his age, as it uses a lot of technical language that I took a while to understand.
have a look at micropython and Zerynth ;) 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPiWg5jSoZI Nothing else even comes close.
Yeah, the vibe I'm getting is that it's between Pyramid and Django in terms of flexibility and opinionatedness. 
K thanks
What's the difference?
Ok, you got a point. ;) In this case, isn't the pyfirmata only a connection and communication protocol between Arduino and Python code running at host computer? If so, wouldn't it be sufficient to write an Arduino function, which does something (using linked class) when Python host sends specific command? Or am I missing something again?
As an author for the blog this makes my day. We have a very strict process to ensure that we continue to meet that quality. 
This is a great website. I used it to learn how to use the argparse library to a relatively advanced level in a matter of hours recently. I imagine the book would be pretty handy to own.
I recently read 'Python Logging' and 'Python socket programming'. Implemented in one of our projects which expedited and improved the whole thing. The site is real quality, real python! A big thanks to you guys! Keep up the great work!
Well what I’m trying to do is get the values from a gyro (MPU6050) using python. I know it’s wacky with python, but I’m trying it anyways.
Okay. I get now. 
I'm using it but what would you consider "ready"? What requirements does it have to meet?
This doesn't seem like python at all
A rather basic reddit clone, it has some of the basics (profiles, posts, upvote/downvote, comments and some more) and I was thinking of adding more features to it. Probably subreddits, sorting by vote count, and other reddit like features, as well as automated testing to make it a more fleshed out project. I initially made it with the intent to just be a CRUD app (like a blog) but it ended up becoming more like twitter at first and then more like reddit.
This is literally the implementation of `load()` in Python 3.7 (minus the docstring): ``` def load(fp, *, cls=None, object_hook=None, parse_float=None, parse_int=None, parse_constant=None, object_pairs_hook=None, **kw): return loads(fp.read(), cls=cls, object_hook=object_hook, parse_float=parse_float, parse_int=parse_int, parse_constant=parse_constant, object_pairs_hook=object_pairs_hook, **kw) ``` No chunked loading (although it is conceivable that future Python versions optimize this function).
Totally agree. I love realpython 👌🏻
I just wanted to run it on my computer. The creator said it is possible.
Hey, I am involved in a project where one of our next tasks involve setting up some GraphQL endpoints. I was looking at [graphene](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene). Any idea how does graphene compares to Ariadne? I am rather new with GraphQL, so sorry if that's comparing apples and oranges (:
Thanks a lot. Would be kind to elaborate how is it diffrent from what Eric has already implemented [here](https://notebooks.azure.com/eric-wieser/libraries/numpy-integration/html/pprint.ipynb)?
https://adventofcode.com/ is also a nice sorce for problems to solve. Its where I learned a lot of Python as I switched to it.
Mirumee Dev here. We currently use Graphene but are not quite happy with the amount of magic that happens under the hood. Its declarative syntax uses metaclasses to register types in a global state which makes the resulting schema depend on the order of imports. All resolver methods are silently changed to static methods which means you're not actually getting `self` as the first argument. As your classes become the schema there is often no way to tell how a small change affects the client. Ariadne was born from out appreciation of the simplicity of Apollo Server's explicit API. We prefer writing schemas in the GraphQL Schema Definition Language, we prefer separating resolvers from the schema to allow resolver reuse and make API testing easy (just use mock resolvers for some of your types). Graphene is not bad but we like how explicit Apollo Server is.
Thanks for the ressources, it's very helpful for me too to improve my Python knowledge ! 
Interesting approach! Although I think (correct me if I am wrong) your custom tool would need some kind of long term credentials to be able to generate short lived credentials, right? 
It seems that firmata supports I2C communication management. Connect gyroscope to Arduino, setup I2C from the Python and read values.
Most people say *peak* when getting this wrong!
Yes, this in combination with Google Style Docstrings (also a Sphinx autodoc extension) makes for human readable and parsable documentation.
R in the python subreddit? Let's gettim boys!
I might be missing something here, I'm new enough to docker. How would I go about developing with docker without mounting the development directory (which makes the development container equally inconsistent as using pipenv) or rebuilding after every code change (which is super slow)? 
Well the site certainly looks amazing - but what's the advantage of Poetry over pipenv? Pipenv seems to be more popular. 
&gt;It's interesting to know the alternatives to the standard `json` library. I'll admit that I rarely second-guess using it, sometimes to run into performance issues later. Try ujson. It's a drop in replacement for json except implemented in C.
Got used to the 88, simplifies my life and layout is still fine.
I truly don't get the logic of Black's default. The sole remaining reason for the 80 char limit (79 in Python to allow for a single char pad) is to allow the code to be read in a standard, fixed-with VT100 terminal or emulator, ie over SSH. At 88 you've already decided "screw the people with that constraint", so why not go to 100? Or 120? Or for that matter just not have a line length restriction and have everyone set up soft-wrapping? I know they vaguely wave a hand at some research having been done into the arbitrary choice, but it's still arbitrary.
I use Pyinstaller to create .exe files, its relatively easy to set up and works for Windows and Linux. Check it out. :)
As I said above, sometimes you send data to generator on each step with `send`. More to say, strictly, generator is not iterator. And if you want final generator result you can't just call it like function, you must evaluate it. If sync and async functions will have no difference in calling style, then this will be a hell for developer to find blocking code. Why you accept `yield from`, but decline `await`? They are exactly equal.
Pandas, of course!
No offence, but I thought this project is about to make tkinter human friendly. I mean, whats wrong with pyside2?
This is a great idea but there are already [gnumeric](http://www.gnumeric.org) (which [does support Python](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnumeric/stable/sect-extending-python.html.en) and Freeoffice's [Planmaker](https://www.freeoffice.com/en/freeoffice-planmaker) with some more functionality on pivot tables. The point is how is this done. If full access to the application was given, a "programmable spreadsheet" could even be the basis for various standalone applications.
You could run python inside the container, and then mount the source code. This way you don't need to rebuild every time you do changes to the code. The development container is similar to the production container because dependencies are installed inside the container.
Well, that's not my experience. R takes a while to load packages too, and Panda's dataframe querying outperforms R's subsetting by miles. And of course there's always numpy for very large matrices. But whatever works for you. Excel shouldn't even be on the radar.
I can relate.. From my experience it's much better to release the imperfect project rather than try to make it all ideal but never actually deploy :)
Pycharm even does all the formatting and stuff for a person. Makes it essentially as easy as can be. I will admit though that I don't use the Google Style Doc strings although I do find them far superior. Because Pycharm does everything for me I rarely ever look at them and Sphinx does magical formatting so my docs just look great regardless.... Definitely a superior style over the default one. I also think the numpy style is very good, possibly even better... 
My experience is that Black safely ignores long strings and comments when formatting. 
So, you’re looking for a CMS..?

Upwork
I wouldn't expect that at all. There are many inconsistencies currently between the different office programs, and there doesn't seem to be any effort to align them further. I suspect the move to subscription selling will mean less improvements...
There's a Talk "Beyond PEP-8" or so from a Python core Developer, watch it.
I use a 34" Ultrawide screen at work, so an 80 chat restriction just doesn't make sense for me. I understand that some other folks are doing a lot of terminal work, but my code gets pushed though a CI pipeline, logs are extracted to an external system, etc. Having longer lines suits me; 79 char line breaks doesn't help my readability
Agreed. And well written.
Do you strictly need to use i2c? Why not serial? Other ways around, if you need to use i2c to comunicate with multiple devices: 1)use an intermediary device (arduino nano/micro) that translates serial to i2c. So you use pyserial to that device. And then that device uses i2c to comunicate to other decices. 2) if your idea is to use some kind of master-slaves you can use pyserial .. and then use usb/serial-rs485 .. and connect your slaves via rs485... 
Oh, cool. This one? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M
There is a case for width limitations: diffs. Imagine yourself doing a three-way merge with 180 char long lines, even if it fits into the screen, it might still be uncomfortable.
I hear ya. In my particular workflow, merging diffs is about a once-a-month event (and even then it's usually only 2-way). Reading my own code is a daily event, so I optimise for the thing I do daily. I understand PEP8 for teams that have to use SSH and terminals, but it's a style guideline rather than a requirement of the language. If your tooling doesn't require it, you can ignore it and *that's okay* If your code is later used elsewhere, many IDEs can format to PEP8 automatically

If I have for example in my html page: ` &lt;a href="contact.html"&gt;contact page&lt;/a&gt;` When I click the link, the app closes. How can I do something basic like this?
How exactly would I do that? I don’t have the I2C class in python.

I tried to pick or eat both the apple and the bread but all I got was: # eat apple!? What do you mean by that?
A few months ago I tried to build something that read PST files but I didn't have much luck. I ended up building a little python wrapper for some powershell commands but it was *really* slow so I abandoned it. If you can get the e-mail addresses some other way, sending emails through SMTPlib is not difficult, and if you can connect with IMAP using imaplib to the account you sent it from, you can have Python parse the receipt messages. I would probably store all of the results in a database with the text of the body as a unique text field so that each message you received would only be stored once. That way, you *should* be able to go through them fairly quickly and determine how the response should be considered as each service that I've encountered has many different, and often unique, methods of indicating that the email wasn't delivered.
Yep, it's absolutely worth the time and covers linelength
Yes. We give our CI/CD platform credentials that we automatically rotate every once in a while. The thinking is that in this set up the long term credentials exist in one place and so can be audited and rotated vs living in Docker images that could end up in our (private) container repository or on our servers if we accidentally ship a bug with how those images are built.
Use the python logging module. The [format strings](https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes) support filename, function name, and line number
r/learnpython
Thank you.
That's interesting. For me, it's just working out where the program ends and where i can pick it up. For example, if i can send emails to all those recipients and then return a csv file or something, it will only populate with dud email addresses because the others wouldn't bounce back. I am nowhere near educated in Python to understand the nuances between what is easily achievable and what just isn't worth the time/effort.
If you don't get a bounceback, then you can assume that the address is still valid. I wouldn't use a CSV file for this, you are tracking too many elements. I'd have one table for e-mail addresses, one for the return responses, and one for the date that you sent e-mails. That way, you could keep track of when you sent something, if they responded, if the e-mail was a bounceback, etc. In other words, a small subset of this is a Python solution, but the majority of your work will be designing how the data are oriented.
Indeed, this would create tremendous potential!

That's a pretty good idea, specially since I see many people who test the game, fail to guess the right "word" to use when using commands, It will be kinda tricky to highlight specific words, but indeed its doable!
This is just so crazy. I have been feeling the need for that as well for the last few months. To advance my understanding of python deeper I’ve been implementing some of its features in js and lately in bash. Yes bash, try to write a few things in it and you’ll see why :)) It would be great to get a daily or even a weekly dose of curated topics.

None taken. Nothing wrong with Pyside2, Qt SDK. However, sometimes you want to quickly produce a 'simple' window to use for a utility. Given the choice, some people would choose PySimpleGUI for the simplicity. I view the question more of a "why not PySimpleGUI?" If someone is just beginning and is struggling to understand classes yet wants to produce a GUI, why not have an option to create one using a simple, easy to learn set of APIs? Looking at the end result as a gauge of success, if I manage to create the exact, pixel for pixel, version of a Qt window, that behaves in exactly the same way and I do that is 20 lines of code instead of 80, does that not seem like a logical path? I'm not talking about building production products. PySimpleGUI wasn't created for that. There's an appropriate and more obvious use of PySimpleGUI for projects and there a good number of them. 
I like reading Dan Bader's web site at [https://dbader.org/](https://dbader.org/)

I think a great place to start would be by laying out the ground floor of the program. Specifics of its parts, what those parts need to function, and how you're going to achieve that. If you don't know how, come up with your best guess, make a note that this section is a bit hazy, and move on until you have an outline for the entire project. From there, you can begin coding IMO. 
Love this! Will make some of these into flashcards for myself. Thanks
Can you smoosh cake on a target's face yet? Oh come on, you MUST! Cake as a weapon? Of course it makes sense! And Pies as a throwing weapon, of course. &amp;#x200B;
If you are interested, we are building \[a collection of python topics\]([https://www.flashcardsfordevelopers.com/collections/5bbff5e1320599b4453230e1](https://www.flashcardsfordevelopers.com/collections/5bbff5e1320599b4453230e1)) into flashcards for bite-sized studying. It's not extensive but we are hoping to add more advanced topics soon.
Well that sounds cool, I thought about a kinda simpler solution that goes like that: using a start string and an end string in the description GROUNDDESC: ['A loaf of', 'lies on ground'] and then I can do like that for all descriptions: item = ITEM['bread'] print(item[GROUNDDESC][0] + C.Fore.MAGENTA + item[NAME] + C.Fore.WHITE + item[GROUNDDESC[1]) A simpler and more convenient workaround (I didn't quite understand what you did here, my brain is laggy :3)
To add to that a really big distinction should be made between "supporting python usage in excel" and "integrating python with excel." You can already manipulate excel via python with ODBC calls, and most of the excel engine would be exposed via those... but it would be insanely unpleasant to do such a thing. A proper integration would expose a spreadsheet as something like a pandas dataframe, but there is no way in HELL that is what the excel team would do. It would make it way way way too easy to allow people to migrate away from excel. So what you would get is the same crappy OOP interface into the spreadsheet that you have with VBA, but with the flow control and syntax of python. I'm not sure how or why that is really desirable. Python isn't just about syntax, its about concepts and a style and approach that is unique to the language. There is a great presentation where Hettinger takes a bit of Java code and converts it into valid python code... and its complete dogshit. A few modifications later and it actually becomes pythonic and nice. If you want to write VBA code with the python language you can do so today. Nobody is stopping you... they might stab you, but they won't stop you.
You have to download the python interpreter to work with it the way you do with the JavaScript interpreter in the browser console

Install linux, move from Windows. Use an IDE like Atom and start with python. There are many resources to learn from here are some good starter ones: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python https://www.learnpython.org https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/ https://docs.python-guide.org/intro/learning/ Don't forget to: - never give up! - be patient. - rethink and relearn some principles you have inherited. - keep it simple. - learn the PEP8 by heart: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
That would work too, but only as long as GROUNDDESC is a list of exactly two elements. This is generally ok, but might not always be what you want. &amp;#x200B; as for my code #this is a flag about whether to use normal text color of a different color #when true use a special color #when false use default color color_word = false &amp;#x200B; split turns one string into many breaking them up with a separator #this takes line and turns it into a list of string when each item line.split('%') so 'A loaf of %bread% lies on ground' turns into ['A loaf of ', 'bread', ' lies on ground'] We can than iterate over that list with for token in line.split('%'): We then use the color\_word flag to decide to print token as regular or a special color, toggling the flag for each token
There ya go... I use OSX for work, but when I have a little bit more money I am going to buy a windows laptop to install Linux on.
Mac is also fine. As long as you dont run Windows. By the way... there are no Windows computers, only unfortunate hardware on which Windows is installed ;-) 
Damn! didn't think of that, and add an AoE dmg since the whipped cream affects nearby enemies and a status effect: Your enemies are mesmerized by the deliciousness of your cake, they won't attack you for the entire battle!
Yea that's what I thought, but I hate online tutorials because it seems that they are all for beginners. It can get pretty slow and cancerous... I also don't know where to look for the 'good stuff'.
Ah! Got it now, that is more beautiful solution, I will keep your code in case I need to implement - I think I will need that feature for some of the longer paragraphs - but for now I believe a list split into 2 is just what I need to display my GROUNDDESC, check it out I updated the repo
Build a website using Django and Postgres, and then replace standard Django templates with DRF and your own react front end. There are tutorials to get you going with Django. If this isn’t what you’re asking for then I’m at a loss. 
No this is what I am going for, I have lots of experience with web development so this is a good place to start!
Don't put yourself on the high chair at this point. When you start with something new.. you have to embrace the fact that you are a beginner. There is a reason why certain steps have to be followed at early stages. If you feel the pace is too slow then just skip and scroll further but don't pass on any items that may be usefull at later stages. After a while you will start doing your own stuff and pace from there on with real world stuff.
Have you played around with openpyxl?
No. I'd prefer Python to be attached to Excel as in [https://www.xlwings.org/](https://www.xlwings.org/) &amp;#x200B; But, POWER BI would be something that uses Python as a scripting and data cleansing language (instead of the horribly bullshit M language). I'd vote for that.
Yes, the python community does have some tools that are good. The point is that MSFT is highly unlikely to actually adopt that tooling. We aren't going to get pandas_excel, which somehow integrates excel with everything else. It would be awesome if we did, but its too dangerous to the golden goose. I don't expect Microsoft to go for it. Instead we will get a modestly cleaner ODBC python interface. So it might be valid python, but it won't be pythonic.
Thanks, I get what you mean. It's the same thing when I learned JS, I had to learn all the boring shit in order to accomplish the real world uses. 
Good luck in your endeavours! May the force br with you.
Thanks for the recommendation! I've actually been trying to use it, but since I use virtual env including libraries in it is a little messed up. It creates the exe but when I launch it, there's a Moviepy import error that doesn't occur in Pycharm. it's pretty frustrating
I'm guessing "Python nmap" is really just python executing a system call to run a separate nmap binary. Take a look at nmap's command line arguments or do a search online for "man nmap". Nmap gives options that let you modify the number of threads, max RTT times and # of ports searched among a zillion other things. Tweaking those settings will surely help you speed things up.
Dido my friend, be sure to look out for my questions here. It took me 3 years of programming to realize how great the Reddit community is for learning people.
Thanks mate for the effort in the reply! This seems just perfect for my next step, when I start to save the dungeon state which will be stored in the form of dictionaries probably, I can do it that way, more efficient and convenient, Thanks again, I appreciate it :)
Chiming in to say I understand 0% of what you are talking about.
After learning Python, you may look into django.
Pretty much all my stuff is hobbyist development, so there's little in the way of "working in a team" or code reviews etc :)
Power BI is already getting some R integration - at least for graphics, which is pretty nice.
Well, I don't need anything fancy, I checked PyYAML's docs and it seems like it works just fine, Is there anything specific that PyYAML is short of?
Yes, that is what my colleagues at work tell me and what some of the people who answered this thread said.
Ahhh good to know, thank you. i'll look into it
Using Linux actually is nicer for Python development imho BUT I'm also using Windows at times. There's a balance :D Also if you're looking for ideas and like maths maybe take a look at project euler :)
Yes - security! It's unsafe to use PyYAML; if it doesn't have a security bug now, it will in the future. ruamel.yaml was started as a replacement for PyYAML, since nobody was taking care of it.
So why is BriteCore not buying Reddit ads?
gotcha
Maybe you'd enjoy something like "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"
&gt; How, and where, can I define for my virtualenv that /usr/loca/bin/sqlite3 is what I want used? You cannot. You have to create the venv with the version of python that has an sqlite3 module which was linked against the version of sqlite you want to use. And /usr/loca/bin/sqlite3 is presumably some executable frontend for sqlite, and not the library itself. So you actually want to link against /usr/local/lib/libsqlite3.so (again, presumably... I'm not a mind reader and I don't know what rando thing you did to "install sqlite" that created this mismatch, because I can virtually guarantee that the ubuntu package managers handed you consistent binaries) Either way, the sqlite3 module is compiled along with python. So recompile python and ensure the compiler is pointed at whatever sqlite library version you do want to use. Then use THAT copy of python to create the venv.
Run some asyncio services in production and we are very happy with them. Asyncio takes a while getting used to but once there it definitely a good shout in certain cases. 
Dude, you haven’t investigated at all. On the python docs, there is literally a link for more advanced programmers coming from other, especially C-type languages like JS. I rarely say this to anyone but myself when I’ve wasted time, but: **RTFM!**
Why is it better out of interest?
https://github.com/sdispater/poetry#what-about-pipenv https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/8jd6aq/why_is_pipenv_the_recommended_packaging_tool_by/ I was just wondering if you had looked it and weighed it up, but I think it is probably going to be a bit much for your needs, as it is more project management than dependency management.
Found this to go off of for just doing a test async run with PortScannerAsync but getting a crash soon as I start: import nmap nm = nmap.PortScannerAsync() def callback_result(host, scan_result): print '------------------' print host, scan_result nm.scan('192.168.1.0/24', arguments="-O -v", callback=callback_result) while nm.still_scanning(): print("Waiting &gt;&gt;&gt;") nm.wait(2) An attempt has been made to start a new process before the current process has finished its bootstrapping phase. This probably means that you are not using fork to start your child processes and you have forgotten to use the proper idiom in the main module: if __name__ == '__main__': freeze_support() ... The "freeze_support()" line can be omitted if the program is not going to be frozen to produce an executable.
It will give you projects you can build as a nice little introduction. 
My good sir, I work a full-time job. I'm sorry that I didn't read the documentation in more depth, it's a lot easier to have people who are more experienced than I am to guide me in a more focused direction. The internet is great, but it is easy to get lost.
This is an awesome answer, so many great links!
Thank you, I will take a look at this.
Ah. I had actually watched it some time ago. Watched it again. I think the talk is worth watching and the tl;dr of it, as I interpreted it, is; to look beyond the design guides of pep8 when writing code and not be blinded/distracted by it and forcing your code into fitting into its rules/guidelines. Makes a lot of sense (like when treating most guidelines or rules like this) but it gets a little sensational halfway through when he goes on rewriting/refactoring very specific code which is not really on topic (just my opinion).
Err because they are ASCII, each being one byte, and python has bytearrays... foo = [ 104, 116, 116, 112, 115, 58, 47, 47, 101, 110, 103, 105, 110, 101, 101, 114, 105, 110, 103, 45, 97, 112, 112, 108, 105, 99, 97, 116, 105, 111, 110, 46, 98, 114, 105, 116, 101, 99, 111, 114, 101, 46, 99, 111, 109, 47, 113, 117, 105, 122, 47, 105, 112, 108, 115, 106, 102, 107, 102, 107, 114, 111, 100, 115, 101, 101, 103, 103 ] res = bytearray(foo) print(res) # for extra fancyness removing the bytesarray-repr # print(bytes(res).decode()) Even faster than a list / map and simpler (assuming one knows about bytearrays).
It's like doing dabs for the first time, /u/dabbingDeveloper. You may cough a lot at first and you may get too high, but eventually you get used to it and then you begin to enjoy it a lot more

If you use cryptic "puzzles" that will never be used in the real world, not even remotely, tests of engineering competence, you're not ready for me yet. https://i.imgur.com/52rC0eN_d.jpg?maxwidth=640 Not to mention suggesting inperformant list comps / maps on a "puzzle" that can be solved with a single built-in.

Contemplated even posting this. Been around stack overflow forums and how a question like this would go down for me lol. Thanks though 
Excellent book - as an experienced python developer I learned a lot just from the first chapter alone. Turns out some obvious stuff wasn’t obvious to me until someone spelled it out.
Try `python3 —version`
Reminds me of old DikuMUD...pretty cool!
Look for programming challenges! It's the best way to learn a programming language quickly. To practice, go to websites like hackerrank, uri, spoj, codeforces
But would it be wise for black to not have a default line length at all? I think back when I started out with Python and had no idea about what pep8 was. I tell you, my code is a lot more readable today, not only thanks to pep8 but pep8 sure helped out and especially because of its line length guideline.
Why not?
Thanks!
Package it using shiv! https://github.com/linkedin/shiv
Yes.
What OS? In Unix, you should have a symbolic link "python" somewhere in $PATH, that points to "python2". Switch it to "python3". If it's not a symbolic link, just copy it to "python2" and make a link to "python3". This may break system scripts made for older version of Python, so make sure everything is OK after that. 
Hahha you're so right. May god forgive me.

I feel you though. It was a great analogy.
&gt; it doesn’t work in the same way as JavaScript, where when you type it you see it. What? If you're a ReactJs programmer then you probably know node.js. Python has a very similar workflow. For Python: $ echo print('Hello, world!') &gt; script.py $ python script.py Hello, world! For node.js: $ echo console.log('Hello, world!') &gt; script.js $ node script.js Hello, world! You write a script and run it. You can also use the repl, it's very useful to quickly try things out. This is also similar to node.js. For Python: $ python Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48eceb, Dec 19 2017, 06:04:45) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. &gt;&gt;&gt; 1+2*3 7 &gt;&gt;&gt; exit() For node.js: $ node &gt; 1+2*3 7 &gt; .exit You already are into web development so you can start creating an website backend in Python. https://demos.aiohttp.org/en/latest/tutorial.html
That's precisely why black -- which after all is meant to format Python code -- should default to pep8's line length until it can make a convincing argument that 88 characters is _better_. An argument which _I hope_ is better than "it's good luck in Chinese" or "it's a common neo-Nazi abbreviation for Heil Hitler". As an aside, my code has evolved, but without a doubt it's become its _most_ readable since I started using Vim in a window that's exactly 80 characters wide. That line length constraint doesn't hurt you at all, in fact I'd argue it leads to better, more organized and beautiful code precisely because it doesn't encourage you to use variable names that are run-on sentences but with underscores instead of spaces... but the key point is that a standard set of style constrains ends up just being a benefit, a benefit that an auto-formatter should most likely adhere to until there's a well understood reason to deviate from them.
More efficient. I'm using linux Mint for the most part and the UI just allows for a more efficient workflow imo. (Small stuff like for example I save a new file from VS code and want to make a new folder for it, I may want to look at the other folders in the folder for a naming scheme. On windows I have to go to the context menu and then it shows the name of the folder I'm naming somewhere in the list and jumps to the end - with linux there's a create folder button straight away that pops open a small text box to plug in the name) Also console commands. And Windows just is a bitch sometimes ("you can't do that", "why would you remove that file extension?!", "why are there multiple dots in this filename?!?!?!?") I started out only working with windows and tried linux time and time again and tried to love it but it always felt like a massive WIP - with mint it feels much better than windows. I also recall some python packages (zbar?) not being available for windows. &amp;#x200B; And the biggest reason to use mint is the matrix-numbers screen-saver you get... :D
Python Linux out of the box will work and should be reasonably up to date, depending on the disto you use. Apple's python is old, and so is their TCL/Tk libraries, [which can cause crashes](https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/) if you don't update them. You either use the 64 bit python and its built in library or you have to update TCL using something like ActiveTcl. tl;dr: less library stuff to worry about.

If you think it's bad you might want to put a legit disclaimer in there warning people of how insecure it might be. Kudos on the effort I guess.
Mac and Linux both run on Unix . . . Unix is better. It is honestly just preference, Windows can do a lot of the same things as a Unix based system, but having a PC that is set to run Unix is just that much better.
Thanks for the reply! I like that approach. Mapping out my goals first and breaking the program down into pieces makes it seem a lot less daunting. I made a spreadsheet last night to have the information I need at a glance for when I start coding. I'll get started mapping out the program as you've suggested. Thanks again! 
Of course you can run multiple instances as long as Instagram sees multiple accounts coming from the same IP. Each account will have its own instance, pass it as a parameter. I’m not familiar with instabot. RaspPI should be able to handle few hundreds or more such scripts since they are super simple instructions. Time them appropriately.
Thank you, when I get started with python I will try to do accomplish some of these.
CentOS? You have to enable it every time. I use venv 
I appreciate this comment, I don't know who downed it.

Either improve it until it has sufficient quality by your own standards or stand by the quality of your own work. Sharing low quality work which you're not proud off or talking down your own work which you actually think is good enough to be shared and used by others will get you nowhere.

I can't figure this out because I missed two lectures on turtle. I am full time employed and struggling currently with simple task. If there is anyone that could help me out finish this project I would appreciate it a lot! So I can't use absolute position of turtle so the movement must be relative. Drawing must start from the beginning of red square and after red shape it needs to draw green and yellow, than blue and lastly purple one. Again, if there is anyone that has a bit time to spare and help me out I would appreciate it. I am familiar with basic principles of turtle and functions so even a minor hint would be great. Thank you!

They don't run on Unix at all, they run on Unix-like kernels. Unix is its own OS.
Go to https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp, it's a page that will teach you the basics of python, for youtubers I recommend Derek Banas, which has about 26 python tutorials that are high quality. And if you want a cool dark themed IDE you should use Pycharm. I'm a begginer in python as well so these sources I mentioned helped me the most, I wish you good luck :)
"Resolver one" is an interesting concept, that I think hits on what you describe. I don't know how similar it is too some of these tools you mention. Unfortunately I believe it is commercial and not free. 
My bad.
Thanks, wasn't aware of [it](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolver_One).

I was looking for something to work on for my final project for my python class. Cloning the repository now, off to learn how this thing works.
I've never deployed a web app. Have you ever discovered any bad bugs after the fact?
Tried there. 90% of replies are "I have a Wordpress portfolio, what site would you like me to scrape?" or, "I can do this. £10,000 please". :) Thanks anyway. 
Cheers, I thought that was for full/part time rather than one off projects! 
At least you’re eventually educable. Have a good time with python, man!
Thanks for being civil, this is the reason I love Reddit!
Also a nice one! :-)
Exposure? You think the IT field is full of those offers - you should see the number of tight bastards who try that line on in the photography field. "You spent £20k on camera equipment, insurance, years training, three days on location, and two days on photoshop but if you let us use your image for free you'll get great exposure." Mind you, I graduated in Comp Sci in the 90's (diving instructor from 2003 so I'm well out of date and forgotten most) so I know what both fields are like. I was IT Director of a live streaming media company in 2000, we were taking and filtering live questions to celebrities. So I expect anyone working to get paid for their efforts and expertise. And I'm always mindful of the Charles Steinmetz story :- ================================ Ford, whose electrical engineers couldn’t solve some problems they were having with a gigantic generator, called Steinmetz in to the plant. Upon arriving, Steinmetz rejected all assistance and asked only for a notebook, pencil and cot. According to Scott, Steinmetz listened to the generator and scribbled computations on the notepad for two straight days and nights. On the second night, he asked for a ladder, climbed up the generator and made a chalk mark on its side. Then he told Ford’s skeptical engineers to remove a plate at the mark and replace sixteen windings from the field coil. They did, and the generator performed to perfection. [Henry Ford](http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/hf/) was thrilled until he got an invoice from General Electric in the amount of $10,000. Ford acknowledged Steinmetz’s success but balked at the figure. He asked for an itemized bill. Steinmetz, Scott wrote, responded personally to Ford’s request with the following: Making chalk mark on generator $1. Knowing where to make mark $9,999. Ford paid the bill. ================================= Problem is, I'd never be interested in someone whose only question is, "How much?" &amp;#x200B;

Uh with respect you're overly defensive here for no reason. I wasn't making a dig at you, nor other fields-- just describing my personal experience. There are many people who would rather pay $2/hr for Indian "developers" (not that there aren't good indian developers, but many that I've seen accepting such rates are absolutely horrible) than pay even $10/hr for people with proper experience (and IMO those people should be getting at least $40/hr minimum when starting out, according to UpWork).
My god. Thank you! I was strugling doing thos in functions (made it possible with step by step) but now I understand!!! Thank you!!! Dear reddit, sorry for posting this in wrong section and appologies to mods!
I agree with this sentiment. You basically don't need pipenv if you use docker as your dev and prod environment. If you get creative, you can merge dev and prod into a single image using either a multi stage build or an entry point script which performs the final steps to run the code, reducing parity between the two environments.
Why not JSON?
AWESOME Sorry lol let me clarify, so just from a processing standpoint, you’re saying I can run the simple script for 100s of accounts off of one Pi? 
Public records
Depends on the requirements for the virtual currency. It could be as simple as just creating a database table and updating it. Or if you want to process cryptocurrency payments then CoinPayments is a good start - https://www.coinpayments.net/ You might also look into the APIs for gaming cryptocurrencies like Gamecredits, etc.
good point. Then a better introductory sentence would be along the line of explaining that property allows one to overload the various actions possible on an attribute, such as accessing, assigning, deleting.

“Press 1 to be connected”?
Similar to that but pressing more keys. Can that be done using python?
Sure, ask user some question with specific answer, that human knows instantly, even "one plus two" is something person knows instantly, yet simple bot doesn't (some more advanced bots might).
Thank you 
Tnx for explaning to me how to use search function. Its not like there is milion projects over there..... very useful comment! 
As someone who fights robocallers daily (professionally, among other things) I can tell you that a simple “press 1 to be connected” will stop 99.9% of them dead in their tracks. If it’s human solicitors you want to stop, you can do a dead simple “using your number pad, please type the first three letters of the person you are calling’s last name.” That will neuter cold callers dead in their tracks. If it’s a human and they know your name you probably aren’t stopping the call easily. You can use a blacklist, which can be defeated by caller ID spoofing. You can defeat caller ID spoofing by “trapping” the call by remote forwarding it through an 800 number to get the ANI details and running your blacklist against that (though a too aggressive ANI blacklist can block legit VOIP callers from getting through). Seriously though, as a general rule robodialers can’t at random push a single number. No need to complicate things.

Really interesting to know. It's good hear from someone with real experience. I wonder if the type of "attacker" makes much difference. e.g. if lots of people want to call *you* it's a bit different if people want to call *everyone*. 
what do you mean your python skills plateaued long ago?
This is looking really cool. However as I am playing the game I am having difficulty seeing highlighted lines of text after I interact with them # pick weapon!? What do you mean by that? As and example this line is almost unreadable because of its red highlight. I can still see by highlighting the whole line with my cursor but just a thought.
From the nmap manual. So yeah... you could pick something between T4 and T5. "The main effects of T0 are serializing the scan so only one port is scanned at a time, and waiting five minutes between sending each probe. T1 and T2 are similar but they only wait 15 seconds and 0.4 seconds, respectively, between probes. T3 is Nmap's default behavior, which includes parallelization. -T4 does the equivalent of --max-rtt-timeout 1250ms --min-rtt-timeout 100ms --initial-rtt-timeout 500ms --max-retries 6 and sets the maximum TCP scan delay to 10 milliseconds. T5 does the equivalent of --max-rtt-timeout 300ms --min-rtt-timeout 50ms --initial-rtt-timeout 250ms --max-retries 2 --host-timeout 15m --script-timeout 10m as well as setting the maximum TCP scan delay to 5 ms." 
As an aside, I would suggest posting this on r/linuxquestions replacing "python nmap" with nmap since this might be a more "unix-aware" crowd. 
Append is 0(1). I imagine extend is faster (when compared to looping and appending) as you are doing stuff in C. I would very much doubt much of the time is outside of networking time. You could throw a `python -m profile --sort=cumtime test.py` to do some profiling (or you could use "C-c profiling :)" 
You can see it that way if you want to. Or you could think "damn maybe I should have done some searching around before asking for handouts". Either way I don't give a shit.
Don't think i've ever used profiling before, i'll have to look into it, thanks
If your sole goal is to find employment I would suggest you do a research on what companies in your area are looking for and then mold your learning path to fit those requirements.
P.S C-c profiling works by pressing C-c a few times and see where the thing is running most of the time. 
Might be better to ask for help than answers. The problems will only get harder and more open ended from here. 
Same here. 80 chars hinders my code readability, so I set it to 120 and can still have two panes side by side if I need it.
You have different necessities for different projects. Maybe some projects needs Django, others needs flas, and other need tensorflow. It would be good to isolate each project environmen, like garage for tools, kitchen for foods etc

Quit any job where some asshat makes you write a Fibonacci function. 
My friend and I were discussing generator functions vs. generator expressions. Then this happened :) 
What if you've already been working on a lot of different projects and didn't use virtualenv at all -- is it possible to go back and set up virtual environs for existing projects? I'd assume you need to start with some sort of minimal environment and then set it up from there? TIA.
Yes, it does. People who want to call “everyone” typically use a dead simple to set up programmable VoIP service and don’t bother to even spoof caller ID. You can use a service like Twilio to do a lookup by phone number on the telco to see if it’s one of these providers or not (coincidentally Twilio is one of the largest programmable VoIP services I see abused this way, but if it wasn’t them it’d be someone else). Chances are if one of these telcos are calling you you don’t want the call. That’s not to say they won’t spoof the caller ID but it’s not super common. It’s usually a person when they go through that trouble. Coming soon to a phone near you is a standard called SHAKEN/STIR. Long story short it’s basically using certificates to validate the origin of calls and makes illegitimate caller ID spoofing easier to detect (if it works as advertised you’ll throw up all sorts of red flags spoofing a number you don’t own).

Agreed, there are numerous resources a google search away. Visit stackoverflow and even reddit to ask questions about particular sections of your code. Once you get the fundamentals down then the rest of the projects will start to fall into place and you’ll be the one helping others get started. 
`img2pdf` is what you want. 
I def second this opinion. I also like the following post if you are still working on gaining experience with Python. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2573135/python-progression-path-from-apprentice-to-guru

You can write a non-ugly generator without the use of yield. Look at the [class-based version](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators)
Not yet. Been looking into netmiko now to see if it address the issue.
So I tried extend and got a funky thing where instead of appending the full IP it appended each digit of the IP into a single element in the array haha
Telegram has support for bots, I think.
Only had 1 project where client asked for a virtual wallet (name is whatever you fancy), not sure what you wanted but here's how it works: We have a table called UserWallet containing the details of the current balance and some other metadata like token, created, updated. Another table to record transactions to and from the wallet. We use Payment Service to allow users to "top up" i.e. increase wallet balance (imagine Wallet as a special merchant item that user can buy). Now users can use the wallet's balance to purchase services/merchandises from the site directly (there are benefits to attract users). When user buys something, decreases the balance from wallet and creates transaction record. It's pretty much straightforward.

Just wanting to make sure... You are referring to a Python virtiualenv and *not* running the entire OS virtualized in VMWare, VirtualBox, etc. No disrespect intended, but from your verbiage it sounds like you're just starting your journey and getting terminology wrong is really easy to do.

Is this reddit only syntax/coding issues? I think I assumed people knew a lot about Tweepy and pulling data from twitter. My issue is with the amount of Twitter requests allowed to be pulled through Tweepy. My thought is they are limiting the amount of tweets I am allowed to pull. So when I scale out with a for loop, it starts to freeze. According to documentation I am allowed 900 tweets every 15 minutes. https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/timelines/api-reference/get-statuses-user_timeline I appreciate your help.

I've studied typography. At the time, computers weren't yet used for book publishing, more towards the end of my studies, some discrepancies have been resolved (the size of a point / vs typographic point etc.) So, I have to tell this to people claiming how 120 or 180 is the "most readable width for them". Well... that's kind of bullshit you convinced yourself of because of how your Pycharm shows your code (single panel on the left and the rest--for code); because you cannot configure your editor to be more useful, you feel that there's "unused empty space", and you are trying to make some use of it, even if it's not really a good use. Another problem with this design is that, probably, your code has a lot of indentation, so that if you were using 80-character long lines, you would be effectively using only about a half of available space, meaning you organize code into meaningless classes, write a lot of nested ifs instead of function calls, have too deep hierarchies of things, and then have to access them from the very top of the hierarchy to the very bottom, or, perhaps "fluent" interface etc. In this case, yeah... having more screen estate would have improved your condition, but it is a wrong optimization technique. The 80 characters isn't random. Earliest screens were designed with industry standards in mind, which, in this case, came from typography, this is also how typewriters were designed: 80 was the maximum number of characters you could print on a standard A4 (or for those who hate international units: letter) sized paper. Industry had to standardize the paper sizes and typewriters so that there be a comfortable way for humans to read the text, and that was the number it arrived at. There are all sorts of reasons to it, but they are mostly biological properties of an average human: how much text can one see w/o having to move their eyes / head from a distance from which the text is readable etc.

Is it must be in python? I'm using `convert` utility (linux) and it is pretty awesome

I've never used it, but I hear pysoundcard is a good and extensive library used for on the fly audio generation. I'm hoping to have a look at it in a future project of mine

Let's test those codes 😊
I'm working on object tracking from above a drone to have the drone be able to void objects
Any part you’re specifically interested in? * Flask: this is used at a very basic level. I use Flask routes to render html pages, and I pass in data to said pages m from python functions that query the database (I.E “show me all clan members that own this weapon, and how many kills they have with it, and sort by most kills to least kills”). The end result is an html table with this data. To get this Flask knowledge, I used Miguel Grinberg’s tutorial. Can’t recommend it enough for anyone looking to get into Flask. I can expand more on the other parts of the project tomorrow. 
I don't know the answer to your question, but if you won't find it, you can use that screenshot to make your own colorscheme. Just copy syntax file to ~/.vim/syntax and replace colours. 
Hi thanks for the comment . I will make the changes you suggested and release a new version. About it being device independent, I have seen terminal apps on windows that support true color but I haven’t tried them out. Let me know if you have tried it out. 
Awesome man! Nice project :) I love OC.
https://overiq.com/django/1.10/intro-to-django/ 
Thank you, to be honest, the idea isn't actually original (is OC "original content"?), but the explanation and code are :)
Awesome man!!! Loved it 
I don't know of anyone who makes videos about their "large" python projects, but Corey Schafer has about 20 hours worth of full python web dev content with flask and django. Some projects follow really good git guidelines which should allow you to follow a dev's thought process for individual commits and pull requests.
I always wanted to write a program that added Ben day dots to images... guess it’s about time to get round to it.
`n += 1` desugars to `n = n + 1`. So, the value of `n` is fetched first, then 1 is added to it, then it's written back. Depending on the ordering between threads, which is not deterministic, it's possible that two threads read the same value, then write the same value. If you want deterministic behavior, you have to use a lock around your value, and have each thread take the lock, update the value, then release the lock, which will be slower than doing things in a single thread
Isn't this GIL job to promise that only one thread can access to a specific memory section to prevent race conditions like this?

How do you print the mask?
&gt;\~/.vim/syntax thanks!
I don't have syntax folder tho.
# Can you explain me how to do it? I am new to vim and linux. 
Got it, Thanks, one more question, Why the same function won't work with multiprocessing? after running with Process the value of n is 0
Because in multiprocessing every process has its own state, so neither of your workers actually accesses the value of `n` in your main process.
You means It's dumb to use \`global\` keyword in that method when using multiprocessing?
You need to print it on a transparency film.
have a look on radiant-voices https://github.com/metrasynth/radiant-voices/ It is a python library that uses very powerful multi-platform sound engine sunvox. Library comes with a few scripts for playing or exporting to WAV. 
The poster isn't using multiple processes, they are using threads not multiprocessing.
Indentation matters. The problematic line, as well as the two above it and the one below, need to be shifted to the left by four whitespace characters (or one tab) for the compiler to parse it. I think.
The error message just can’t be clearer. Is there an indentation level that matches that matches that of this `else`? No, there’s none. 
Yes, I noticed that now. Still, the same idea works.
1. Locate default colorscheme file. Usually it's in `/usr/share/vim/vim&lt;VERSION&gt;/syntax/python.vim`, where `&lt;VERSION&gt; is a major version (i.e. `80`). 2. Copy this file to `~/.vim/syntax` directory. If directory does not exist, create it. 3. Edit file and link colour categories to keywords (look for `hi def link` lines). You can find categories and their colours in `/usr/share/vim/vim&lt;VERSION&gt;/colors/*` (choose a file for your colorscheme). You can also make our own colorscheme by copying `default.vim` from `/usr/share/vim/vim&lt;VERSION&gt;/colors`, but that will change colours for everything.
Uhm soryr mate but i just started pyhton a good weke ago with having to learn everything from the internet , I dont know what an indentation level is. 
Indent the second `if` statement and you're good to go. `if` `else` statements that belong to the same 'choice point' need to be on the same indentation level. In other news, you can replace loop=True while (loop == True):` with: while True: # do a thing # when you want to break out of the loop break

oh i see, my apologize i will re do
https://docs.python.org/2.0/ref/indentation.html Your code looks something like that: ``` if stuff: doStuff() else: doOtherStuff() ``` This is indented incorrectly because the `else` is just hanging around, not _aligned_ with the corresponding `if`, so one should _dedent_ it. 
If you already use matplotlib, this is a pretty easy way to serve your graphs up as a SVG or png over the web.
I am not completely sure if I need this library
Ikr, I always loved the style of those games
Looks beautiful, I guess?
That letter is â, It can be fixed by adding # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- However as u/Conan776 mentioned, 2.7 is dying and I am not intending it to be 2.7 compatible, why for?
It means "repeat forever" using `_` as a name for "who cares, we don't use it". As a statement, you would use `while True` but in a generator comprehension you can't use `while`, only `for`.
Upvote for remembering the two-argument form of `iter`.

This is a great thread and I love reading through the comments in topics related to this because they have historically been able to shed some light on projects, libraries, and new thought processes that I have been able to apply in my personal and professional career Currently I am working width py odbc and teradata libraries in conjunction with pandas to establish open database connections to various database types, iterate through servers and databases to extract all available tables and samples of data contained for further investigation as to whether or not the data is relevant to my department If anyone reads this and has experience exploring unknown databases specifically in teradata, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL, feel free to share your experience and tools used in your traversals
You need to understand that tests should never depend on another. While it would help you write a better organized integration test, the headache that comes from tests leaking data is just too much. You can either: Combine all the tests into a single function that has all the steps for the integration testing, organizing with comments, or you could create the user on a fixture and then try to login. 
It is not a library, it's a build tool that outputs a binary. The binary will run on any machine, as long as the target has a compatible python version 
Started working seriously on a cron manager CLI: [Cronbat](https://github.com/Hrabal/Cronbat). In my plans this will become an extended version of crontab: with cron imports, analysis and improved cron readability. At work I have to deal with 300+ lines crons, and those are a pain to read and edit. Plus several apps are on the same server on different users so I always have to look into other users's cron to not overlap too many scripts and saturate the server. If anyone is interested helping/collaborating... be my guest! p.s: while working on the cron manager I ended up building a mini-framework for command line interfaces that I'm planning to distribute separately: [ClassCLI](https://github.com/Hrabal/ClassCLI)

FYI r/learnpython is the place for "learning how to do the Pythonz". Anyway... The script you linked uses some modules that are not part of Python's standard library. You need to install them using `easy_install` or `pip`, both of which are bundled with Python (at least if you downloaded it from [python.org](https://python.org)). All you need to do is to run e.g. `python3 -m pip install &lt;module&gt;` where `&lt;module&gt;` is whatever third-party dependency is used. I will also recommend [repl.it](https://repl.it), among others, which allow you to run code in the browser. It downloads any packages the script needs, though its Python version lags behind the current one.
Arch linux and the default Python is 3.7.1.
The first two lines in the code are **import** statements. As you can see, the code is importing 4 items: 1. **requests ** 2. **bs4** (its full name is Beautiful Soup 4) 3. os (this comes with python) 4. html from **lxml** So, you need to install these 3: *requests, bs4, lxml* It is simple to install them. Open command prompt and type **pip install requests** and press enter. It will do its thing. Repeat the process for the other two. The commands are * **pip install beautifulsoup4** * **pip install lxml** If it says pip is not a command, just follow these steps: 1. Open command prompt. It is already open. :-) 2. Open Windows explorer and navigate to your Python folder. Open it. Inside you will see **Scripts** folder. Open it. Do you see *pip.exe*? Then you are in the right folder. 3. Now copy the path to this folder. How? -&gt; If you look at the top in the windows explorer, you can see the path in a bar. Just click on *white space inside the bar*. This will highlight the path. You can press Ctrl+C to copy. 4. Now that you have the path to this folder copied, go to command prompt. Type this command **cd "path-comes-here-press-CtrlV-as-you-already-copied-it"** and press enter. For example, the command looks like **cd "C:\Python36\Scripts"** 5. Did the folder that is shown to the left of the cursor change to this folder? If yes, then you can do pip install. After installing the three, you can just run the file.
Quandl is a good service with an excellent API [https://www.quandl.com/](https://www.quandl.com/)
Yes I use it but it does not have movmax or rollingmax supported in Python.
These days, I think you can't just slot someone into being a 'beginner' / 'intermediate' / 'expert' programmer because the term 'programmer' is too generic. I know people who are absolute experts on certain frameworks or within certain areas of expertise, but if you move them to a different area, they struggle. For example, I'd bill myself as intermediate / expert on web frameworks, but if you put me in front of big data libraries, I'd struggle. Now, someone who's an expert in one area will likely be able to get up to speed faster than someone who had no expertise at all, so they're not always a bad hire. With my current job, I walked in knowing almost no Javascript. I got up to speed quickly, though, and had a web app deployed fairly quickly. A better way to discuss skill would be to talk about what you expect, as a company, to see in someone on a day-to-day basis. I know some companies would see me as an intermediate JS developer (I can write JS and debug it fairly reliably), while others would put me more in the 'beginner' category (My CSS is crap and I don't know all the frameworks), and others would make me an expert (The frameworks I know and the skills I have are highly valuable to them and they don't really care about the other stuff). 
I'm not sure what exactly you're doing above. You have your LocalHost, TargetHost1, and TargetHost2. LocalHost needs an SSH key. Its public key needs to be added to TargetHost1 and TargetHost2. [Add your key to ssh agent on LocalHost.](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/) Add your public key to the authorized_keys of TargetHost1 and TargetHost2. SSH to TargetHost1 using ssh -A which will use your local SSH agent for forwarding. Now when you're on TargetHost1 you can ssh to TargetHost2 without a problem. You can accomplish this with just SSH. If you try to use Paramiko you won't be able to do forwarding. Fabric wraps Paramiko and may work for this. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7729301/how-to-forwardagent-yes-using-fabric
`black` is sent by gods since it also reformats files while alternatives do not. Also, yes, running unit tests before each commit can be draining, CI already does that job. I've been trying Git hooks for a day now, trying to find a way that will make me productive. That's why I asked what the community does with Git hooks. :)
&gt; what should I focus on next if my immediate goal is employment? Applying for jobs. Seriously. You can study until you're 110 years old, but you ain't going to get no jobs if you don't apply for them. 
I'm a new programmer in general and I have no professional experience, but I'd like to think I'm almost at the intermediate stage in python. I'm capable of taking an idea and getting it to work the way I intended. I'm now in the process of taking the apps I've built and trying to make then run more efficiently with fewer lines of code. To date I've built a battleship game from Automate the boring stuff, but I changed it to have the capability of handling multiple ships, multiple players and has a save/load function. I've made an app to automate getting my news and weather in the morning with a nice GUI. I also made an app that gets my steam games list and returns how long each takes to beat and spits out a file with a list of games that have less than 5 minutes of play time (have to get through my backlog haha). I'm now just starting my most ambitious project. I work as a mechanic for a school bus company and I am working on an idea to make a raspberry pi device to connect to the CAN bus and retrieve data from the engine computer while a bus is on its route. I'd like to get each bus it's own device and have a notification on my phone any time an engine gives a diagnostic trouble code. Could you guys give me some insight on where I'm at and maybe some things to study to get closer to being an intermediate programmer? Thanks! 
Are you sure this is a good place to post basic language explanations? 
Like /u/tunisia3507 I just use CI to run tests and other commit/push appropriate tasks. If need be I can run unit tests locally easily enough.
Much needed, I appreciate the share immensely, thank you! 
Yeah, the main reason I use hooks for linting is I always forget to do it, push, and then bitch about it when my build fails for an over-long line :P

Hmm... I really don't like the concept myself. It kind of feels like "false certification" in a way. That said... I guess it is necessary to work out what people know. This post probably is quite similar in nature to kcunning's below, but I would be tempted to "explode" the notion of python programmer into different parts. Many of these are relevant to most sorts of programming. Like... expertise in python obviously *does* exist. This like the weird details of libraries, language features, metaprogramming etc. For example... I just wrote a library that can take a class hierarchy clone it and switch out one of the classes in the mro - that isn't really something I would expect "intermediate" python programmers to know... but then I'm not sure it really lets me write better code! (It might help me debug weird python features). So yes, I would encourage you to explode up the skills you might need. At a guess these skils might be things like * Unix * Web technologies * Debugging * Algorithm design * Knowledge of the python infrastucture * Git * Python libraries / certain libraries * Niche python features You can then assess these skills one-by-one. Hiring is hard! 
I am just gonna live it there &gt; PyCharm is overrated. #spyder #jupyterlab #vim
Nice approach for the local check before pushing. But IMO it should be done on CI anyway. It has several advantages such as preventing merge/pull requests if the pipeline fails. Also its not required for every user/developer to set up locally and is already 'built-in' to the project. And its executed always and always the same independent of any user specific local messups ;)
&gt; I've started working black https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ for convienience
I used to have git hooks but is always a problem to force all the team to have them, also people have different version so make it hard to make it work on every computer (if everyone uses linux would be easier...) CI make sure that you run everything and everyone is aware ... and there is no chances that you in your local skip the hooks because "it is urgent"...
It’s called [Prolitfic](www.prolitfic.com), it’s a writing community for aspiring authors trying to get their work published. We have a blog, workshops, analytics, and contests where winners can get one on one interviews with publishers/editors/published authors/agents. It’s still in early stages and we’re going to transition our community from our facebook group to our website at the beginning of next month. Anyways, I manage the backend for it and learned Django/AWS on my own, so I’d be happy to mitigate someone else’s learning curve by means of my own painful experiences.

I normally don't care what other people's editor preferences are, but those hashtags are cringe, man.
Wow. That's a lot of hate for a default setting that matches the standard for...pretty much everything, as far as I can tell. I've literally never seen control-Y mapped to redo in any application before. It's always control-shift-z (command-shift-z on Mac). I just went into half a dozen programs to confirm I'm not taking crazy pills. This is baffling to me. I guess this is a Microsoft thing. But should Microsoft really be considered the standard to which PyCharm should conform? Whatever. I'll stick with the old way.
Considering the number of people who come through here who have experience with Python but want refreshers and help, and the disdain expressed toward/on r/learnpython, I think this absolutely helps here.

Depends on the payment I guess, but gratitude is unfortunately not a valid currency.
Thanks kumashiro !
You have a CI. You should use it. What's wrong with committing a test that fails anyways? It's not like your machine includes the 8 build environments (e.g., 4 different versions of python with a range of packages). I sure don't want to wait that long and maybe I'm fixing a bug someone needs. If it's a problem that builds fail, push to a branch and only then push to the msster.
Looking forward to the next one! 
IMHO Beginner is someone who is learning the language. They can create basic scripts, and modify some more complex programs. &amp;#x200B; Intermediate is someone who can write more complex programs. They can teach others what they know. They follow PEP-8 reasonably close. &amp;#x200B; Expert is someone who can write complex systems. They can mentor others in their learning. They follow PEP-8 and PEP-257. They can write dunder methods which make sense and can write subclasses of builtin types and know when to avoid doing so. They choose the right data structures for the right tasks, and are proficient at optimizing for code readability and for speed. &amp;#x200B;
Thank you for this presentation I think it's the good place :-)
One more thing, some of functions are bolded, how can I make them normal? can't find anything on internet about that.
It was just a quick question but someone already helped me
Why don't you just use testing mechanisms DRF provides? Also, you should avoid whenever possible to create dependencies between tests. Ideally, all test cases within a test suite should start executing with the same state. from rest_framework.test import APITestCase, APIClient from rest_framework.status import HTTP_200_OK, HTTP_201_CREATED from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model from django.urls import reverse_lazy User = get_user_model() class AccountTest(APITestCase): TEST_USERNAME = "user1" TEST_PASSWORD = "giggity" TEST_EMAIL = "wtv@giggity.test" def setUp(self): # Executed before each test case self.user = User.objects.create_user( username=self.TEST_USERNAME, password=self.TEST_PASSWORD, email=self.TEST_EMAIL) self.client = APIClient() def tearDown(self): # Executed after each test case. Remeber: all test cases should start with the same state. User.objects.all().delete() # test cases def test_success_sign_up(self): payload = {"email": self.TEST_EMAIL, "password": self.TEST_PASSWORD} response = self.client.post(reverse_lazy("api:signup"), payload) self.assertEqual(response.status_code, HTTP_201_CREATED) self.assertEqual(User.objects.all().count(), 2) def test_success_sign_in(self): #TODO pass

Although I’ve seen both on every data analyst jon I’ve applied for, my work has remained 99% in excel except for data viz tools like Tableau and power BI. I think for huge companies like Blackrock they would be more used, however I am yet to need any of these to solve something excel cannot so far. 
You can also copypasta the code into idle and click run module.
Chrome and Firefox both use it. Atom and VSCode both use it. LibreOffice uses it.
It's a great idea. I keep a "secret work blog" that is published publicly but not promoted, where I write up all the things I've learned. It's super helpful to me. Making it public is a little scary, but sometimes I get good replies that are helpful or make me feel good because I helped someone else. The best thing is occasionally I'll search Google for how to do something and find _my own blog post_ about how to do it from years ago, a technique I forgot.
&gt; It is already open. :-) XD
Any book with design patterns should be sufficient, they mostly aren't language-dependant.
*Yes*. I do this, and loads of people I work with do this. What I have personally found useful writing this: * Make it searchable and search it. (I do this by using an emacs binding that starts searching "titles" in an outline file - you needn't do something so complicated.) * Keep it brief. I view this file as a "list of where to find stuff" rather than complete documentation. I tend to link to more complete documentation. Also there is this weird effect where you write notes to yourself where you remember what you meant regardless of your notes. 
Glad you figured it out, next time ask specific questions instead. This sounded like you wanted to outsource your homework.
It's a colour attribute in colorscheme (`cterm=bold`). Either remove that attribute or see if you can disable bold in your terminal settings. The latter is IMHO a better choice, because bold text looks kind of unreadable in terminals with font ~10-12pt. Your choice. 
You could use pexpect 
An excellent idea. I use a personal wiki for organizing stuff like this (see: Tiddlywiki), since it's searchable and far more freeform than a flat text file, but to each their own. Experiment. As someone else noted downthread, blogging about your experiences is also helpful, since it functions as a kind of diary.
[Design Patterns: Elements of reusable object-oriented software](http://www.worldcat.org/title/design-patterns-elements-of-reusable-object-oriented-software/oclc/31171684) is a very, very good start. As is [this one](http://www.worldcat.org/title/data-model-patterns-conventions-of-thought/oclc/33013426) for data modelling. Although a bit outdated it still contains a huge amount of useful information for certain common use cases. Also good reading is anything coming out of the [OMG](https://www.omg.org) group in your domain (in terms of standard models). Hope this helps 
I’m a complete beginner and I can tell you that you can find this stuff with a simple google search. Don’t be lazy. 
Well I guess everything is in my first comment &gt; so you don't have to call make_pretty yourself And you can also read the linked documentation for more informations. It is the blessed way to register function to handle displaying object in IPython. It mean that a user does not have to call `make_pretty` themselves, it will automatically be called when a numpy array is the last expression of a cell. This also mean that the user will not have to learn about `make_pretty`, and can just go about their normal workflow. 
You have to run it from bash not within your python interpreter. Type `exit()` and you go back to a user@machine shell prompt, then type `python &lt;your_file.py&gt;` and it will run the python binary, which the file as an argument, so python will run the file instead of going to its own shell (the `&gt;&gt;&gt; `).
First off, exit the Python Shell "exit()" and do "ls" to see if your in the right folder, if you're not, do cd Desktop and then just hit "python labfile_1.py" 
My work is 90% automated in excel already, I could use python for data scraping but it would save 5 minutes a day and take a week or so of figuring out most likely. Though I’m learning python anyway just in case.

Only by a gentle nudge to point peeps consistently to r/learnpython
You're trying to run the file from inside the python interpreter. To run a file with `python labfile_1.py` you need to exit python. 
2 things I spotted: 1) You are already Inside the python console. In there there may be a way to run a python script but I don't know how or if it even makes sense. To exit the python console you can type "exit()" or "quit()" or just hit ctrl+d 2) Your command line is at your home directory (the ~ represents the home folder). Your python file is on the Desktop so you would need to do `cd Desktop` and then `python labfile_1.py` Or `python Desktop/labfile_1.py`
No. By definition these people are new to Python, so it makes sense that they don't know the rules of /r/Python.
Also just wanted to let you know about the very good /r/learnpython subreddit, better suited for questions like this, in the future. Good luck!
Are you trying to cut the 'Score' column or are you just trying to order the animals within their species?
Hey thanks for replying so this is what I’ve done, typed exit(), then typed python &lt;labfile_1.py&gt;. The reply from the computer was bash:syntax error near unexpected token ‘newline’. Don’t really know what this means. Thanks again though I really appreciate the help 
convert is part of https://imagemagick.org/ -- for almost all platforms
I'm having trouble with all of them. I want to rote learning the answers for tomorrow but learn the concept right after the test.(fyi I swear I'm not cheating you. I sincerely don't know these and I just had my subject changed and got this so....)
I swear to god I tried but I cant. I swear dude. Just suggest one good website. And I swear I'll do everything my self
True to some extent. Data scientists prefer to work in R and they are extremely proficient at statistical mathematics and have experience from working in many projects. R in itself isn't a very difficult language though and in the end it's just a way to implement their models.
Sorry, I didn't make that clear. The &lt;&gt; are used to generalise something, in this case the file name, I said `&lt;your file&gt;`. You replace everything including the &lt;&gt; with the name of the file. So in your case `python labfile_1.py`
I swear I cant find this on Google. If you think I'm being lazy just tell me a good website. And I'll get this infobmyself
Thanks so much I’ve done it now, loving reddit more than ever
Thanks for the help I’ve done it now 👊🏾

I gave up on doing this years ago. I never found it helped me remember stuff, and if I was going to search the stuff I had noted down, I could just as easily Google the stuff and find where someone else had wrote it down. &amp;#x200B; That being said, if the process of writing/typing stuff will help you remember stuff that it's useful to remember, then by all means do it!
I tried running your code. I had to make the following changes: 1. Fix the indentation error in the toString() function of Node 2. Change the print statements to the python 3 syntax However, once I'd done this I then added the following lines at the bottom: triangle = PascalTriangle(5) print(triangle.toString()) ...and it didn't give the errors that you described. I mean, it didn't give the correct answer, but it certainly didn't give any errors about NoneType.
`TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'str'` Clearly you're trying to concatenate an object of type `None` and a `str`, and I'm guessing it's happening in this line `returningString += self.findNode(x,y).toString() + " "` since it's the only place I could find where the `+` operand is being used with an object and a string. That must mean that `self.findNode(x,y).toString()` is returning None, which according to your `findNode` function should return None only in the case where `return self.triangle[row][col]` throws an IndexError. &amp;#x200B; I only copied your `Node` class and tried to make an instance of it and it gave me all sorts of errors during instantiation. Take it step by step, fix your `Node` class first to work as intended, then figure out the rest.
This looks like python2. First of all you are using the old class system. New style classes must inherit from object. ``` class Node(object): .... ```
This is likely not what's causing the issue, but instead of defining a custom to\_string method you can use the magic method \_\_str\_\_ which is called if you do str(object) \[\_\_str\_\_ must return a string\]
Okay thanks! Also any other site I can get the answers from
Haha. Don't worry. No need to watch me talk :). I understand your comment such that you see a tension between reproducibility and the effort that goes into ensuring it and ask whether reproducibility matters in practice. Regarding the first part, I think the key here is to make reproducibility as cheap as possible (for me: pipenv will automatically document the versions of packages, I try to not modify data in place to make processes easier to understand, I embedded unique tags in important results that tie result to code and setup, ..). However, I have to admit that random numbers are still quite tricky. Regarding the second part, I think this effort pays of. Two scenarios in particular come to mind: First, I often want to extend something and need to make sure the thing I build upon is still sound. Typically, I do so by reproducing the old result. Second, I am sometimes asked to explain the results I produced in detail. In this situation being able to trace the different steps that transform inputs to outputs comes in very handy. However, this process boils down to being able to reproduce the results step by step.
What does the value do here: `self.findNode(placeX, placeY).value`
Which version of python are you using because my node class instantiates fine
Yeah I had to tweak the pascal constructor because I saw I set it up differently than my CPP version, but also I'm using python 2 and I'm not getting an indentation error so that might be a reddit thing?
Thank you for reminding me about that, sorry I sometimes default to C and Java habits
It seems strange that reddit would randomly break the indentation in that one specific place. Try just changing the implementation of that function to: return str(self.value) ...and see if that makes any difference.
Hi. I read your question and understand that you understand what patterns are and you probably have already read about them but you are specifically looking for a book which gives explanations using Python as the language to demonstrate them. I have seen a book like this but can’t think of the name off hand. I’ll use this comment as bookmark to return when I find it. I did want to mention that when patterns first came onto the scene in the 1990s the programmers of the day had to implement them themselves, often in clunky ways. As a result, to alleviate this, several patterns influenced the design of Python and became part of the core language. e.g. iterators and decorators. Java which also came to prominence at that time was also influenced by Patterns and, in my opinion, became too unwieldily because of the complicated pattern based object oriented design of some of the libraries. I just wanted so say that your question was clear that you were specifically looking for a Python based explanation.
That bot exists as I’m sure you are aware :)
That didn't but I did the \_\_str\_\_ thing someone mentioned a few comments down and did `returningString = str(findNode(x,y)) + " "` &amp;#x200B; After converting both toString(self) methods to \_\_str\_\_(self) and it works now I can't say I learned why it broke but it works now 
That fixed it, I don't understand why but that did it
Currently working on it with my colleague Ellis Shannon it's a ww2 based adventure following a young conscript it is a little bit of both 
Here’s one more that specifically discussed Singletons: [Python Design Patterns: For Sleek And Fashionable Code](https://www.toptal.com/python/python-design-patterns) 
Could we add something obnoxious for first time posters to go to learn python if they have a question for it?
Highly doubtful, but wow are there some seriously bad posts with way worse code lately. It's also interesting to notice that a large amount of them are asking questions about scraping various sources.
Sounds good. I'm doing a statistics project and the multiple layers of menus are getting a bit messy lol. I can't imagine how you'd manage a text adventure in Python. Gotta be a challenge! 
I made a test harness, make instances of PascalTriangle and compare them/print them out
Finally getting serious about learning to work with data using libraries like pandas, matplotlib, requests, stuff like that. What sucks is that many of the tutorials use deprecated methods, in addition to using API request methods that worked perfectly - back when Yahoo Finance API was a thing. Also, there's a lot more literature on advanced pandas than basic pandas. /endrant It's still super fun though. I'm spending several hours of my free time per day experimenting. 
Actually it's not that hard just a bit awkward 
Also, for whatever reason, deflated fruit's suggestion fixed it
In my experience Excel doesn't come close to pandas or R. The only reason I do any type of analysis in Excel is when I need to collaborate with coworkers on something. If that's what you're using and works for you I ain't gonna bring you down brotha! 
Yeah I mentioned in another comment that same thing
Exactly. An email address has a set syntax and if it's valid you then need to check if there is a server that responds to that address.
No I realized this was weird and I asked a question in another post lol. I just thought DMing someone would be more helpful
Make us proud! 
Look over your toString function. It doesn't seem to actually be doing anything.
I wish this existing for /r/django too. For a while I tried to point people to the /r/djangolearning sub, but it is never ending so I gave up.
Oh damn. I missed the #PYTHON2, my bad... I'm on py3. Sorry about that.
Everyone learns differently. Try it. If it works for you, great! If you feel it's tedious and you never reference it, then stop. There's a wide variety of choices, from a plaintext file (maybe in dropbox for basic version control and syncing) to a commented plaintext python file, to interactive ipython notebooks, to a full blown markdown editable wiki (e.g., tiddlywiki) or full-blown blog (e.g., wordpress). Personally, most of the time, if I learn something unfamiliar as a coding technique/software library **and actually use it to program something with it** -- I can recall that I've done it before and can quickly remember where I used it in my source code and that's where I can check (possibly helped by a quick `grep` search). So I won't say write a blog post on how to write a `Memoize` decorator, or writing a django management command, or creating a fabric file, or [...]; I'll generally know where I've done it and can consult that if I need to do it. (That said, in my source code if there's something weird or some documentation I based it off of, I'll leave that as a comment/docstring for my own later reference). That said on some big complicated long-term project where you have to do some experimentation with different ideas, I did find a lot of benefit from keeping a personal work blog. But this rarely would be about programming language pitfalls; more of I realized ideas A, B, and C didn't work because reasons X, Y, Z, so that's why I'm going with idea D and I have it clearly documented so when someone asks why I didn't try reason B in two years I can go back and show the argument I wrote up. The blog would mostly be posts -- tried idea A and got these results. Trying to find why they don't make sense or how to improve.
Data Science is an interdisciplinary field and requires a strong statistics background, knowledge of pandas (python library similar to R), R, SQL, various tools to display or interactive with your analysis- typically flask in python, shiny in R. You'll find resources in /r/pystats and /r/rstats
Well that's odd
Perfect thank you!
Report them as unsuitable for this subreddit. From time to time, that works; at least if a post is reported enough. However, it is unclear to me whether a post gets an automatic grace if people start discussing it here? Can we get a clarification from one of the active mods? /u/aphoenix or /u/Andrew_Shay 
I can concur about keeping a notebook. Lost an older one a month ago, remaking it, but it DEFINITELY helps.
Yeah, Jupyter in the form of a personal cookbook is a really neat idea. I have a small personal cookbook and using `ag` (the silver searcher, just to make it explicit) makes it really fast to grab some functions or for quick reminders on some notes. I would've surely done Jupyter if it wasn't an overkill for my use case.
Oh man that sounds like a lot of fun (weird definition of fun), I’d love to need it at work so I’d learn it quicker, but we just don’t have enough data to bother, or the analysis is always fairly basic stuff. Hope one day I’ll be doing the stuff you do! What type of data are you analysing if you don’t mind me asking? Like what are you finding out? 
Dude. asking people if they know interesteing projects that need contributors isnt a hand out. Either way, you are douchebag. Go take a zoloft or something. 
&gt; Also there is this weird effect where you write notes to yourself where you remember what you meant regardless of your notes. So true. What a weird phenomenon. When I'm fuzzy and start re-reading my notes on a certain subject, it usually clicks before I even finish the first sentence.
Here's what I recommend: * **Be polite** * Report the posts. We try to clean up frequently, and if they are reported they are much more likely to be removed. * Point the people to r/LearnPython. * Point the people to the discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7
I'm an engineer at Wallaroo labs. I've done a lot of work on our Python API and I wrote the blog post. If you want to discuss stream processing, or Python, or Pony (the language that the core of Wallaroo is written in), I'd be happy to do it here.
I'm a fisheries manager so I'm always looking at how many people were fishing, what and how many they caught. Looking for the amount of fish returning based on environment conditions etc... I did do a small project for a friend that demonstrates the power of these libraries. I didn't come up with the model but I was able to automate it with flask and pandas. It retrieves temperature data for a location then runs it though the model to see how close trees are to blooming. Running on a dockerized flask container on an AWS EC2. http://pnwdouglasfir.ty.codes/

Congratulations i am so happy for you.. But i have a question about digitalocean If i get a droplet on do i have to pay more for the domain name??? 
Btw your website has to be responsive (for mobile users) considering that your targets are mobile users and 😢your game is not available in my country 
I don't know. We spent several days debugging a production outage in our Python app because some request was blocking the event loop by spawning thousands of tasks; this would cause the health check to time out and the load balancer bounced our service. We haven't found a good way to debug these issues, since it could be any request on any endpoint that is causing the problem. We've also seen this with libraries that do sync I/O under the hood or just CPU-bound workloads in tasks. None of these would have been problems for Go. 🤷‍♂️
How much zoloft should I take?
PyCharm does let you use custom keymaps. &amp;#x200B; The thing people are complaining about is what the default key is. You've always been able to change it in PyCharm.
Do it already.
I am interested too! Let me know 
Could posts with a question mark in the title be flagged automatically somehow? Yes, there would be false positives (such as this post), but it would be a start. &amp;#x200B;
Or maybe just every post that has a question mark in the title.

You have to pay for a domain name if you want the .com or .org like mine. &amp;#x200B; You could maybe get a free one with a shady .tk or stuff for free from freenom. &amp;#x200B; Digital Ocean themselves don't charge you for the domain name.
As an obsessive journaling fan I will always tell people to try it. For me, writing in journal, is a rubber ducking taken to extreme. Works for programming, design issues and life. My ~~two~~ three starter tips: 1. when you'll get your notebook of choice imminently write some nonsense on first page. Many people get hang up on "how to start properly", once you break the invisible seal you won't be afraid to make a mess of it 2. if you want, you can check out other people setups and methodologies of keeping a journal, but don't get married to them, do whatever feels natural, with writing, as with everything, finding your sweet spot takes some time. Steal concept, make them your own 3. get good writing instrument, something that you enjoy using, it's important to never feel uncomfortable with a tool you need to free your thinking
Thank that was helpful because i am about learning django using corey yt channel .. And i am planing for lunching my own website soon.. 
also thank mr skeltal for good bones and calcium[^*](https://www.reddit.com/r/tmsbmeta/)
Once you get into hooks and start using several of them in several projects that need to be kept in sync you might want to have a look at a way to tame them with the pre-commit framework: https://pre-commit.com/ - works also nicely together with [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (tox is using it for its own linting - see [here](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/blob/4116de9e34b1ee13d3d8959b4b357d4da4649534/tox.ini#L61) for an example - all hooks are defined in a [.pre-commit-congig.yml](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/blob/3.5.3/.pre-commit-config.yaml). The basic workflow is that devs do whatever they like locally (e.g. having the hooks installed that pre-commit offers or running lint env though tox or not bothering at all) and CI makes sure that linting is always enforced by running the tox env as a first stage in CI and aborting the build if the linting stage fails.
I believe so, try taking a look at [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/help-me-point-domain-to-my-droplet)
I am reading lot of nice blog posts and collecting different techniques at a single place. Till now I have got 384 entries and my (unrealistic may be) target is to reach 1,00,000 entries. ( [link](https://github.com/kuroop/python-notes) ) But it's very satisfying. Learning something daily about Python.
I mentioned something about making REST Api's. Flask has a framework for that. Also I simply just followed a recommendation from someone on stack overflow.
Thank you so much This is a much way better than baying a one.click.up and a dns from another provider.. So i gonna bay a ubuntu or centos droplet and configure everything by my self ... 
I just followed a list online of English speaking countries. Sorry about that. The update should be live by now. Thank you for trying the game if you play it!!!:)
Haven't checked it, but from my experience, collecting files in python isn't trivial as you might think. Python doesn't support import by file path. It must be in a package in the PYTHONPATH (sys.path) Try to run it with profiler, you probably find interesting things.
For sure i gonna play. It seems nice one.. Is it a unity or ue4 game .. Btw have a look at this web freamwork (materialize.css) it.s gonna help you a lot to build nice and responsive webpages .... If you have any problems with it feel free to txt me☺ 
With python especially, I think the point at which this classification is useful is like, maybe the first month or two of learning; beyond that, it just becomes more a matter of knowledge and experience with utilities and specific domains.

I love using Evernote for my study notes. I can quickly search through my different “notebooks” and they also include a code block option.
I'd say for easily responsive Web pages look at a front end framework like bootstrap, there's a python library to easily integrate it with jinja2 and flask. And if you use it right (which isn't difficult) you'll get Web pages that look at least good quality on most screen sizes

It's developppers now m8
For me my journal is my github. But instead of entries it’s full of various projects. In each I lesrn something new or write something that inspires me later down the lane and I can reuse it, or reuse the idea behind it.
That's just my opinion and you are probably well on your way to expert.
unittest?
What is it?
That's a very weird restriction. What about countries like Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands? Virtually everyone speaks English there.
I discovered that running Pytest for something that is not a package is a terrible idea. So, I make sure to remove current directory from PYTHONPATH before I run it, and I only put on PYTHONPATH things that are relevant to the project. It means that I install tests as a sub-package of the package they are meant for, but this way I make sure the imports are correct, native extensions are found, setup.py does package all the sources I need etc.
I didn't know what I was thinking in my 17 year old self......
It's a classmethod for sure. You just have to subclass TestCase
Yeah, I use unittest.TestCase almost daily, I just don't see any methods that do what I've described.
Yep, my current project is mostly intended for desktop use, so I haven't put any real effort into making it work on mobile. But since I used bootstrap, I get basic responsiveness for free, and when I check my pages at mobile size they look pretty decent.
How so?
Don't focus on the Dutch market. Your website name has a certain meaning here ':) Out of curiosity, did you enable HTTP 2 if you used Nginx?
If you’re making a CLI program to download the whole Internet, you probably don’t want to download the whole Internet on each test.
Hey Tom, Love the framework so far ... but is there a way to get autoreload working while developing a starlette app on my local machine? I got everything running in a docker container but can't figure out how to configure the app to autoreload changes as I'm working on it.
... and you’re being nice!
Ugh.... what does it mean? I know it can mean a cancer sore or a district in Africa. &amp;#x200B; I think I just used normal HTTP, but I really don't know to be honest.

Import/export notebooks into Python files, to get the auto-complete and other language support from Visual Studio Code, then execute blocks of code (demarcated by comments) against an IPython REPL and build up a notebook-like result window. So it's like Jupyter but with more of a code editor experience and the artifacts can be plain Python, avoiding some of the issues with git and JSON.
It seems that this discussion is about client-side hooks. Is anyone using server-side hooks? That would fix a lot of the problems people are facing and enforces code commit policies like commit message format and the like.
These are some great notes. Might I ask how you go about writing all of that? Do you set some time specifically for writing them or do you write a little bit as you go while doing your research? What is your process?
nice!

Calls that do not require an operator giving instructions to the caller are usually routed to the local jurisdiction/police department/dispatch center (smaller 911 centers like in a city or non-911 call centers) where the caller is calling from. The transfers aren't always due to misrouted calls. Calls can only go into certified call centers with certified operators to be determined the location and nature of the call. The other reason may be telco/internet line maintenance or an outage at another center or even all operators are busy at that particular call center. While the dataset will not lie, the reasons for the transfers may not be clear. Call your local call center (direct number) to see if you can observe the activity and get an explanation of how it works before reporting on data that may not have reasons. -Certified operator
It's explained very nicely in the github: https://github.com/ets-labs/python-dependency-injector
Hah, no I pegged myself as a beginner so you've given me a nice ego boost. Thanks!
Huh, yeah. I blame the guy I copied it from (see link in the script).
If you want a more batteries-included solution, there's a python tool called [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) which might be up your alley. I'm not a big fan because it's an extra config file, it downloads and runs scripts for you which doesn't feel right, and the docs seem sparse for what it does.
I got this to work. Now I need to return an array filled with arrays in the format [latitude, longitude, viodesc]. How would I do that?
Thanks, I’ll call my local call center. Do you think a call center would provide information that specific to a student? Or is stuff like that kept confidential? 
 return [ [d['latitude'], d['longitude'], d['viodesc']] for d in data if 'latitude' in d ] 
[removed]
The only thing that is confidential would be call content. How the operation work, is pretty much public knowledge (aka, not secret) Do not use 911 for your phone call. Look up the call center's business line and ask to speak to the shift supervisor. 
this! i kind of feel bad in context of global warming to have instances powering up and running the whole test suite just to find out that there needs to be a fix because some line of code was over the 80char pep 8 recommendation
Constant network issues, noisy neighbour problem is really bad during peak periods, when they have outages you find out about them 30min after they happen. When they have planned maintenance, you find out an hour after they happen. My initial comment was hyperbolic, but after 6mths of this shit I can’t wait until I’m off of them. 
I use wikidpad for my journal needs.
Thanks you for the input I’ll try to get an update to the article soon, along with a Creative Commons license on my blog content, simple attribution, nothing fancy. 
Main tip for the sub reddit: *Always report learnpython posts* I'm usually really active in moderating. I try to get posts during the day and try to remove throughout the evening but I haven't done much in the last 2 weeks so there might be a higher volume than normal. I have taken some steps to help reduce the learnpython posts since I have been a mod - There are account age restrictions to auto remove posts. This does get a lot - I have a script that runs every 10 minutes and posts on a Discord server if reddit thread seems like a learnpython post, based on different attributes of the post. That's how I sometimes remove posts that are only a few minutes old. I just haven't been moderating much recently. Ideally I would create a new script that tries to determine if a post is a learnpython post, then autoremoves it. And allows a mod to manually approve it. But it's just an idea and I haven't tried implementing it.
I responded above

Glad you like it! It's becoming really popular in the data engineering community. It's definitely better than writing your own scheduler.
Hi there, this post has been removed as it is not directly related to the Python programming language. It might be more topical on /r/programming, /r/coding, or /r/technology. Cheers, /r/Python mods
&gt; In Python 2, a string can contain any sequence of bytes, but in Python 3 strings are explicitly UTF-8 sequences. No, Python 3 `str`s are sequences of *Unicode codepoints*, which need not be possible to represent in the UTF-8 character encoding system. This kind of blurring of concepts is why people find it so hard to handle text correctly, especially under Python 2 :-(
I have 2 enterprise clients on DO and have never experienced any of these issues. In fact I usually get outage alerts before my real time metrics even feel the effects.
A good developer is always looking to be an expert in some things, intermediate in a few more, and a beginner in a whole lot. How good is based on how quickly you can go from beginner to expert in something.
I just gave a couple of tech screenings for Python recently. Generally here are where the junior devs and the more experienced ones differ: 1a. Junior devs [cargo-cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming) more; advanced/experts write according to first principles and DRY. 1b. Advanced/expert knows when to optimize and when not to ("real world"); they'll also profile their code using `timeit`. Sometimes this goes hand in hand with the cargo culting. For example - common beginner pattern I see nowadays is to always load a pandas df regardless of the input file size. Whereas for 80% of use-cases you can just iterate a regular file, openpyxl or sql cursor - which is more easily scalable. Beginner pythonistas don't know what the GIL is. Intermediate pythonistas worry about the GIL. Advanced pythonistas have made peace with the GIL. 2. Advanced incorporates unit-testing. I've interviewed junior/beginner devs who never even bothered checking for exceptions. Beginners use `print()` for debugging; more advanced uses `logging`. In terms of specific language features, for Intermediate I look for: * list comprehensions * understanding argument unpacking (`func(*args, **kwargs)`. There are like 3 IKM test questions involving permutations of `zip(*zip())`) * tuple unpacking (intermediate-free value swapping: `u,v = v, u`) * using dictionaries to store "[variable variables](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1373164/how-do-i-create-a-variable-number-of-variables)". * `dict.get()` and `dict.setdefault()` vs `dict[key]` * `object.getattr()` instead of `object.attribute` * `vars(object)` &lt;--&gt; `ObjClass(**vars(object))` * applying `functools.partial` * use of `map()`/`reduce()`/`filter()` where appropriate; gather-scatter with `multiprocessing` * writing decorators (maybe advanced) For Expert I look for: * written use of `yield` (generators vs. iterators) * manipulating the MRO (`super()`, `object.mro()`) * class composition through overriding of `object.__getattribute__()` * use of `__slots__` * overriding `object.__getstate__()` and `object.__setstate__()` for pickling/unpickling stateful objects * New for 3.6+: use of `async`, `await` and `Futures`. * metaprogramming with the abstract syntax tree 
that's even better!
yes, sorry- I wasn't being critical. I was trying to understand the concept so I read the code and noticed it. 
Is this basically folding the [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.jupyter) into the Python extension and adding a few extras like Markdown cells?
Let me translate: &gt; I have no idea how to use mock so it's bad.
I'd say there was room for improvement on both ends: You're correct, Timsort is way faster and more efficient than anything you could possibly come up with on your own. More efficient sorting algorithms are the stuff from which PhDs are made. b = list(sorted(set(a+b))) Is actually the best way that I'm aware of to do what they asked for. However, as others have mentioned, many times when someone asks a question in the interview they might be looking for something different. If I were in this situation, I'd say, "Well, my first approach would be this" (and then throw up the aforementioned code on the whiteboard). Then I might ask, "Is this what you're looking for, or would you like me to take a different approach?" Because maybe what they want to see is how you solve problems. Now what's interesting is that you mentioned that "it's not a good idea to hash the items because the input arrays are already sorted". If that's the case then it *might* actually be faster to do some kind of interleaving manually, but I don't think that a for loop would cut it, unless there are some assumptions that you can make about the input lists. If I was presented with this problem and someone told me, "Sorry, that's not the best approach," about my first go, and given the assumptions that the input lists are sorted, I'd write something like this: loc_a = 0 loc_b = 0 output = [] while loc_a &lt; len(a) and loc_b &lt; len(b): if a[loc_a] == b[loc_b]: output.append(a[loc_a]) loc_a += 1 loc_b += 1 elif a[loc_a] &gt; b[loc_b]: output.append(a[loc_a]) loc_a += 1 else: output.append(b[loc_b]) loc_b += 1 output.extend(a[loc_a:-1]) output.extend(b[loc_b:-1]) I wrote that code in here without trying it out so it's possible that it's got some bugs. But operating under the assumption that `a` and `b` are both already sorted, and of potentially different lengths, this should produce an output list that's sorted, and it *might* be faster than `list(sorted(set(a+b)))`. But you can use `timeit` to find out.
The whole point of the "awesome" lists is that they give you at least a little tagline of what each item is about. Then you can see what interests you and dig further where you want to. This isn't even a listicle. It's just a list.

We at least now have the auto mod bot remove any post that’s just “here’s my Stack Overflow post, answer it for me”. Working on other ideas too. 
You can use jupyter notebook with code executed in Python and theory or summaries in markdown....It looks so elegant, believe me.
This needs to be higher. Precommit hooks done right. 
it's never a waste of time
Auto mod or any other bot could be configured to post a comment if certain conditions were met, such as certain keywords or account details. Another thing I plan on implementing in one of the subs I mod is to have automod remove and tag a post for manual approval if it reaches a certain negative score, like - 5. This allows the community to sort of self-moderate. 
lolwhut? Java is an insane mess compared to Python. Have you actually looked at Javadoc generated API pages for a Springboot + Spring MVC app? And speaking of throwing a bunch of code at you, the first guide on [bootstrapping](https://spring.io/guides/gs/serving-web-content/) a Spring MVC app is just [listicles](https://medium.com/@gustavo.ponce.ch/spring-boot-spring-mvc-spring-security-mysql-a5d8545d837d) of code anyway. Every time I have to go deal with broken deps in Maven I have to stress eat before and after.
This is sweet! I love your pysimplegui project. Can’t wait to try the Qt version. Thanks!
&gt; the first guide on bootstrapping a Spring MVC app It looked fine for me. But the introduction page of Flask is just a hello world app which, of course, didn't say much. But I did made an app with Flask. I don't use Maven, that's unhuman stuff. I use Apache Ivy. 
&gt; Why do you care about this guy's website? I have an app in progress which use Flask as backend, now I want to add security and came upon this. The documentation does not look fine for me. Maybe the guy is a nerd, and I expect he say more to reach human communication.
Hey, nice bro! Just some comments i) Some print are missing the parentesis; ii) At line 24, input is getting a string value, but at line 25 you're asking if story equals an int. Change it to story = int(input()) Cheers
&gt; How new of a thing is that? Seventeen years. Literally seventeen years: python 2.2 from 2001, according to [this article](https://unspecified.wordpress.com/2010/11/18/pythons-new-classes-vs-old-classes/). Can we stop saying "new style" and "old style", and say "correct style" and "neanderthal style"?
Stop using python 2.
Jupyter Notebook is a great way to learn Python. You are learning actual Python; it's the same language, with a different method of execution. Rather than executing entire programs, either by calling them from the command line or running them with the main method in an IDE like Pycharm, Notebooks allow you to to run small cells of code and chain the results together, allowing you to experiment with ease. Jupyter Notebooks are great for many tasks, but you should still consider learning to use an IDE. The community edition of Pycharm is free and has some great features that make developing software faster and smoother. Highlighting shows you bugs, typos, and style problems on the fly. It'll even suggest changes, give you auto-completion, and a bunch of other stuff. These features will make you a better developer. You'll want to learn the import system to separate programs into multiple files. You'll want to learn to debug. And you'll want to unlock the time-saving keyboard shortcuts and other features that Jupyter Notebooks/Labs don't have. I'm not suggesting you switch immediately. These are things you can learn over time. While you're using Notebook, I recommend using Jupyter Themes and nbextensions-- the Chesterish dark theme with the Table of Contents enabled makes Notebooks awesome. Congrats on starting your Python journey and good luck! 
Because this is /r/Python and not /r/learnpython, it's worth noting that python has a well-defined style guide, and it benefits the entire community for code to be written in compliance with that style guide. It's no extra effort for you to choose one style over another, but it makes your code more readable, more portable, more maintainable. The obvious things here are `snake_case` for variables, methods and functions, 4 spaces for indentation instead of tabs, and no unnecessary brackets around conditionals. `range` automatically starts at 0 so there's no need to tell it to; `itertools.product` is better than nested `for` loops; and if you're absolutely set on using python 2 you should `from __future__ import print_function`.
Don't worry the redesign is more IOS like (I had a different approach then I use for IOS)

about the `main()` function inside `__main__` .

Hello there. Thank you for reply. Good point. I will sort it by categories. 
Lol I think the 90's called and said they wanted my website back :)
Honestly, this sounds like you’ll need pandas and numpy for quick calculations, as well as a detailed set of equations. Hit me up with the equations and I’ll see what I can do for you.
I have written some algorithms to handle accelerometer data solely. The location trajectories I've produced are inaccurate due to integration causing so much error to propagate. These algos extensively utilized numpy and pandas. I believe scipy may offer something of value but I will need to study more.
Thanks! I will take a look at this at dawn. Will update if I learn something useful.

This is what I do for a living. It is fucking awesome. Also (it pays insanely well) I'm trained as a dev, but i currently mostly do BI stuff. The SQL component is less so relevant. Pandas is a great library to start off with in python, though it is probably the least python like library I have ever used. Ignore R frankly python is a much more versatile tool. The other piece people will leave out is you tend to work a lot closer to the decision makers. This is awesome and awful. One if you screw up I can be really damaging. Two if you do well you feel amazing. It is an immensely rewarding field to work in. 10/10 would recommend.

Nice work OP. It's a little disheartening to hear the criticism of the UX of the site, especially as I don't think that was the focus of the exercise, but don't let it get to you. That said, [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/) is one of many CSS frameworks, and it's not at all a PITA to use. Once again, nice work!
That won't work unless IDLE now automatically downloads and installs any dependencies.
I think that's probably where **integration** testing comes into play. I think mocks are incredibly useful to do unit testing and move forward with a project. But, yes, to be absolutely sure the code works as expected, you need to use real data at some point. And, that's where I think integration testing can come into play. You can then write some full-scale test cases that will actually test the code using real data, or even just test data that's been saved for testing purposes.

My current setup is: &amp;#x200B; \- use black to autoformat \- use flake8 to run formatting tests (black doesn't fix everything) \- have CI separated into 2 workflows, 1. to run flake8 and pytest, 2. to publish \- have CI enabled on pushes to open PRs, with workflow 1 running on any branch (sometimes using approval or filtered branches) \- have CI tests pass to be able to merge to master \- have CI on commits to master perform deployment (ship package to a repo like PyPi) (workflow 2) &amp;#x200B; someone mentioned Travis, I personally have only used CircleCI as my CI tool of choice so far and love it.
Attempting to learn web scraping using requests and Bsoup. I'm fairly new to python so it's been a somewhat frustrating learning experience but overall it's definitely keeping my interest.

Let me save you a click: the author doesn't understand what assert is for and used it to raise an exception on password auth failure. Optimization in Python removes the assert. There's nothing wrong with assert. The author misused it.
Every single function carries a None in their consts, so that doing fn() where fn doesn't return will return None. 
When do you really need to use an assert statement ?
Show this conversation to psychiatrist, he\she will decide. Hope you will get well soon.
`uvicorn.run(..., debug=True)`
To expand your comment: if you find yourself mocking 27 different things for a single test, it might not be specific enough. The tested function/method might be too big or does too much, or test checks several unrelated conditions. If you are sure the test should look like that, then it's also possible you've written an integration test, not a unit test.
I believe it's to be used for testing.
Do you have a file called time.py in the working directory? 
Asserts are great for unit tests. They can also be used to verify the state inside an application, or method/function arguments. The assert statements will be executed while you are testing / doing QA, to help you verify everything works as expected internally. When the application is deployed the assertions can be ignored as a performance optimization. As a rule of thumb, assert should not be used in a way that affects the behaviour of an application.

I think you want r/engineering or similar. From my experience, I doubt very much that you can get an accurate position from accelerometers. "Dead reckoning" is very sensitive to noise. You are trying to do it two levels deep, which is even worse. Kalman filters aren't noise-free.
Thanks
Hi, that’s an interesting problem. My experience is that if you have the funds it is far easier and better to buy better sensors with these things built in and calibrated for you. However if you don’t want to do that try to search for Attitude Heading Reference System (AHRS). I have used Madgwick AHRS for estimating angles, not position, in real time in a similar project and it worked well but took some time to set up and calibrate. It is typically used in flying drones to tell which way the drone is going. I don’t think it uses Kalman filters but it is still useful to read up on.

The format command in addlightgroup function does not have {} you had a () instead. Thats what I can see in so far
I agree with everything that has been said here. What I mean is that the syntactic sugar provided by `assert` is a lot more bitter than `for` loops for instance, for two reasons: \- it is not that more concise than the alternative (`self.assertEqual`, `self.assertTrue`, etc in unit tests) \- developers learn to code by reading other developers' code: when you read an `assert` statement as a Python beginner, it is likely that you'll find the syntax neat and that you'll miss the most important thing about it which is that it is for **debug purposes only**. If `assert` was rather named `assert_debug` the story would be completely different. The bug reported on github on this topic is a great illustration of this problem. It is more about best practices and anticipating what could go wrong if a usage becomes widely used.
Nah, it's missing`&lt;blink&gt;` and "designed for" .gif files
I never understood why we make mocking so complex in python, &amp;#x200B; What do you guys think about that ?

Awesome! Looks like an even better version of the Jupyter extension which was already useful to begin with.
Correct me if I’m wrong, but this means .loads and .load do the exact same thing right
pytest supports it. It's just `pytest --junitxml=test_report.xml`

Most of the criticism is going to focus on the UX because thats what the clients see.
Take a look at NLTK. It's a Python library for natural language processing. AFAIR it needs external dictionaries, but most of them should be easy to acquire. 
`assert` statements are of primary use for [contract programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract).
Basically, `assert` (when used not in tests but in library code) is an "impossibility catcher". E.g. "in this situation, x should NEVER be zero, but let's assert it in case we have a bug (otherwise the following code will break violently)". It is a part of "defensive" code style, where some internal invariants are checked "just in case", even if the code's author is almost sure code works properly. Of course, it is a really inappropriate tool for testing invalid inputs, environment state and other things that are "external" to the code, that's what exceptions for.
It's also useful when scripting. Say You leave some global variable You want the user to fill later (like API key, or a password, or a path to a ssh key, whatever) and You want to make an explicit check for it.
And since the Python assert statement is completely ignored when the program is run in optimization mode, then it cannot be relied upon for contract programming. Which was the very point of this thread - to warn people of this behaviour. Many do not know this. 
Incredible
It’s not natural language, though. It’s random strings of text with words inside.
I used a Kalman filter for a University project and let me tell you, you need to have a pretty good understanding of statistics, especially Bayesian, to know how to apply them correctly. That being said, I used [Kalman and Bayesian Filters in Python](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python), which is an excellent Juypter book that builds a Kalman filter step by step from basic statistical filtering methods. It also comes with a companion library that implements all the code in the book, and even explains more of the advanced mathematics used. It's also numpy compatible.
Wordninja package does exactly this very well
You need NLP to distinguish words within words. 
You cannot know what environment your code will run in. It should work regardless of what environment variables or command-line arguments Python is given. 
Warning: Link farming ahead.
Some of the comments in this thread illustrates perfectly why using 'assert' is not a good practice: it is misleading, and not everybody knows they should never rely on it in production code. My primary goal when posting this, was to raise attention on this matter.
Aweosme guide, thanks! 
But this is the wole point of "contract programming" in opposition to "defensive programming". The `assert` allows to catch wrong function usages during development, and once your program is bug-free and ready for production, you can safely remove them to maximize performance.

Lol the first 200 words or so in that list are super questionable. Really cool code though! I wonder how it works for compound words like “sometimes” or “sunrise.”
Just run the notebook server on the server itself and connect it to it from your machine. 
You can export your changes to a ipynb after you're done making your edits. 
When I teach beginners, I tend to teach a concept, then make sure that the next thing reinforces it. My general order (off the top of my head) * How to run Python (shell and script) * Variables (ints and floats only) * Operators (using ints and floats) * Strings * Errors (Try adding a string and an int) * Builtins (print, type, and help) * Booleans and boolean statements * If statements * Lists * Loops Dictionaries and objects are things I do if time permits, with dictionaries being the first thing I tackle. If I take on classes and objects, I first start with pointing out that we were already using objects (showing off some attributes and methods for strings / lists / dicts), and then constructing a few simple ones. I generally don't do this until the students are pretty comfortable with everything else, though.
&gt; You can use the -O or -OO switches on the Python command to reduce the size of a compiled module. The -O switch removes assert statements, the -OO switch removes both assert statements and __doc__ strings. Since some programs may rely on having these available, you should only use this option if you know what you’re doing. “Optimized” modules have an opt- tag and are usually smaller. Future releases may change the effects of optimization. As the documentation, which the issue creator linked, says indicates: This isn't a problem with assert, this is a problem with using the optimize switches blindly.
Reporting works folks. During my morning news crawl I report and downvote shitty bloigs and /r/learnpython posts. Very rarely do I come back later and see any downvoted posts remaining. 
If anyone is actually interested in how asserts were designed to be used and why they are great, buy a copy of Writing Solid Code. It was written for C programming many years ago, but it is a fantastic read for any language and presents a different mind set. If you are reading this and assertions are new to you or if you think unit tests take their place, get a copy of this book. 
Good correction, I misspoke. I confused contract programming with defensive programming. Python's assert in its current form is indeed a perfect fit for design by contract. 
You will never get a trajectory from this set of sensors (BTW, together they are called MARG or [AHRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_and_heading_reference_system) ) They are used, as the name AHRS suggests, to provide *attitude*, not trajectory. You can indeed use a Kalman filter to fusion them and get a non-drifting attitude, but there are several hurdles along the way: - calibration that you already mentioned (it can be particularly hard for the magnetometer if the sensor is in an embedded system with a lot of hard and soft iron perturbations) - acceleration not due to gravity (the Kalman filter works by assuming the acceleration always points at the vertical, which won't be true as soon as your system accelerates substancially) - magnetic perturbations from outside the embedded system (it's an extremely noisy field) I can suggest this reference paper (from what I know, it's what's implemented in Android for example): [indirect kalman filter for 3d attitude estimation](http://mars.cs.umn.edu/tr/reports/Trawny05b.pdf)
Done. Please check at repo
It's the same as this: alist = [] for i in range(4): if not i%3: alist.append(i) else: if i %3 == 2: alist.append(2*i) else: alist.append(3*i) You should ask these types of questions at /r/learnpython.

Would be cool if there was one for google home..
Woo. New tools!
Meh... Tis the first dict list I found (hence "It seems to work").
Thank god, this has been such a pain in the ass for me. The current selection of jupyter type extensions just hasn't been great.
also thank mr skeltal for good bones and calcium[^*](https://www.reddit.com/r/tmsbmeta/)
In the meantime, Alexa play Despacito
Make one. 
You can use something like gunicorn inside the virtualenv. https://medium.com/ymedialabs-innovation/deploy-flask-app-with-nginx-using-gunicorn-and-supervisor-d7a93aa07c18 this uses nginx but you could sub that out for apache if you must. 
Is Omaha the Paris of Nebraska? Are slamming parties the new Eleusinian Mysteries? Does turning Betteridge's law of headlines into a rhetorical question cause it to land in the lap of George Boolos? As Java is to JavaScript, is a shark to a shart?
NLP processing with Python3 :)

In progress... :) I built also couple apps for Google Home and it was fun! :) 
Bracket syntax throws an exception if the key is missing; `get()` returns a default value.
