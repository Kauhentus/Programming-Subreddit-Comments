I create software libraries for Raspberry Pi add-ons (known generally as HATs for hardware attached on top) and- for better or worse- the canonical language on the Pi is Python. It’s seen generally as a fairly friendly language for beginners and since the whole community is involved with projects, examples, guides and tooling there’s no reason to go against the grain. But that’s not to say I don’t enjoy Python. It’s quite probably my least-hated programming language on reflection. I’ve just released Python libraries to deploy fonts for use with example code that drives LCDs, OLEDs and eInk displays- working with namespace packages and entry points has been interesting and has allowed me to solve the font problem in a way that can be shared and built upon by the community.
Because it's more fun than any other language.
great input
For the exact same reason you said. Additionally I use it to process data into a database. So then I can either query the data later through SQL client, read it back in to python into a DataFrame, or build a web app on top of it. I am imagining that people have to come to you directly to get data, but you could look at building “workspaces” for you or them to access and interact with data using webpages (check out DataTables and Highcharts). The only time I don’t use python is when I know I will be relying on a database to do the processing for me. You could have tables in flat files and do the “join” yourself, but I like the process of coming up with the right data model in the DB and using built in functionality to get my results. 
I've been using those daily or weekly for more or less the last 10 years in all manner of different projects and I haven't missed XML once. I'm thinking either you're wrong or the intended use cases for XML documents (I was always a bit hazy on that - as, I think, were they), just wasn't one that there was ever much call for.
Most of the GUI libraries can do this (wx, pyqt) at some level. The pycairo rendering library may be a good option if you don't need the rest of the GUI stuff. For serious font-rendering features, you need the pango and pango-cairo libraries. If you just need basic text (simple helvetica font), cairo's basic text api can do this. You may also be able to use the FreeType python bindings to render font glyphs to bitmaps and composite using cairo.
If you want to learn Python from scratch, I recommend the [official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html), which is not only the best programming tutorial I've seen for any language but also the only good one. Some, like LPTHW, are [actively harmful to the learning process](https://sopython.com/wiki/LPTHW_Complaints).
I'd be fine doing that. how do I post or share my code?
I will use pandas for this. Put the data into pandas's dataframe and print it with style.
The waiting pauses the current function, so it must be async too. Try it. import asyncio def wait(): await asyncio.sleep(1) On Python 3.6.6 I get a SyntaxError.
Upload it to pastebin or paste it here and [use styling accordingly](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/ref/faq/formatting_guide)
You are iterating over parts of a string, substrings will always have the same type you are iterating over. Although that would be true as well if your code would iterate over a list of strings, since you convert the value of i but never do anything with it. Think about it this way: you take a thing out of your sequence for every iteration of the loop. You put this item in a box labelled i and output the type of the content of said box. You then convert the content to int, put this integer in the box and inspect its content again. Afterwards you throw this box away and the next iteration of your loop starts. If you wanted to exchange those strings for their integer value you would have to: a) use an appropriate data structure (list) and b) actually put the integer value somewhere that survives your loop (in the simplest case: targetlist[index] = i)

The reason is that `Number`s in JavaScript are in fact [64-bitfloating numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format). In this format numbers is stored as combination of significand, exponent and sign. Sign uses 1 bit, exponent uses 11 bits and significand uses 52 bits. Since numbers are stored in normalized form (ommiting special cases like NaNs, actual infinities and denormalized numbers), significand's value lies between 1 and 2, and in order to calculate an actual value of number you need to multiply significand's value on 2^exponent_value. You cannot add numbers directly which are written in normalized form, you need to transform a lesser value so it would has the same exponent value as the greater one. Since number is stored in binary form, it is just a matter of shifting significand right to the numbers of bits equal to the difference exponents. When you try to add one to 2^54 in JS, the significand of one is shifted for 54 bits which is more bits than significand can actually have. So this significant number is lost, and thus 2^54 is added with zero, resulting in, of course, 2^54. In contrast, Python has the difference between floating numbers and integer numbers. AFAIK Python holds integer values in fixed-width integers in case it is possible and switches to long numbers if calculated value is too bog to fit in fixed width integer. Thus Python has no precision loss. I also want to emphasize that this error occurs purely due to the way of storing numbers, so `2.0**54 + 1` in python would yield the same result as in JS.
**Double-precision floating-point format** Double-precision floating-point format is a computer number format, usually occupying 64 bits in computer memory; it represents a wide dynamic range of numeric values by using a floating radix point. Floating point is used to represent fractional values, or when a wider range is needed than is provided by fixed point (of the same bit width), even if at the cost of precision. Double precision may be chosen when the range or precision of single precision would be insufficient. In the IEEE 754-2008 standard, the 64-bit base-2 format is officially referred to as binary64; it was called double in IEEE 754-1985. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Why? Cells are declared by comments of the form `# %%`, so they don't require anything fancy in your files. Besides, they are not only used in Spyder but also in PyCharm.
I have no formal training and it's really easy to learn especially for what I need it do which is run daily SQL queries starting at 6AM, dump them into excel and save them. Just looking at Java code makes me nauseous while I can follow python code. 
Hm, I appear to be talking or of my ass. Don't mind me...
 Thanks for the warning
I think you're missing the point. Again, see TEI.
There a lot of good networking libraries. That the syntax is easy to learn for a beginner is turning out to be a bonus.
&gt; Couldn't "why do you use X" be generally answered with a list of advantages of X, and "why don't you use X" with a list of its disadvantages? No. Common reason for using X is because I already know it/it was first result in google/people I know use it, and for other people neither of those may be seen as an advantage over Y. Similarly, main reason for not using X is "because I already have Y" and "because I never heard of it", which again for someone else is not usable argument.

Good explanation, but op is using a list after `test = test.split(", ")`
is your book filled with pictures of ipython notebooks? That's how it looks for me on safaribooksonline. If it is, then that's a big bummer tbh (looks kinda bad and makes copy/paste impossible).
Number of possibilities. To generalize, if by abrupt reboot you mean crash, your file system could have corrupted and then failed one way or another. Or for some reason python was compiling your code and the system rebooted before the compiled bytecode was flushed to the disk. Either way if that's the only "issue" you have, it isn't an issue. If your fs was corrupted, you could have lost other things as well.
Sounds like r/learnpython would be a better fit for this question.
if you haven't tried it, kotlin's pretty fun 
I like having a reserved instance micro EC2 and dockerizing the flask apps. Pretty cheap.
Basically you did not even change type. You can do following: for idx, i in enumerate(test): test[idx] = int(i) &amp;#x200B;
I got into python for the automation/pipelines, stayed for the machine learning. Plus it's super flexible and the online python community is very active. Really makes almost anything python-related feel quite accessible. 
You can try one of the Talk Python to Me [https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/all](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/all) courses. I recommend the "Python Jumpstart by Building 10 Apps", but if the company is paying, why not just get everything bundle. Then you can show completion to the company of the 10 apps, and have all the other courses for you. I like Michael Kennedy's podcast [https://talkpython.fm/](https://talkpython.fm/) if that's something that interests you as well. He made the above courses. If you have a lot of money to burn, I had a colleague participate in this training [https://www.enthought.com/training/course/python-foundations/#/schedule](https://www.enthought.com/training/course/python-foundations/#/schedule) and we both thought it gave him a really good jumpstart into Python and programming. (He had a PhD in Biomedical Engr and did the scientist/engr one.)
Whenever I use flask in a vm like AWS I have to set... app.run(host= '0.0.0.0') because http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or app.run() is set for localhost.
Your Client Credentials json is available to public. Might wish to remove this from git for security reasons. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; This is great for classroom project, but in the real world and from a security perspective, passwords should be salted and not visible to anyone. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
If you have PyCharm Profressional (you can get it for free if you're a student), I'd highly recommend using [its remote deployment tools](https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2017/10/connecting-to-deployment-servers-and-remote-interpreters-with-ssh-agent/) for projects for working with Python on remote machines. You can run your program/server on the remote computer *through* your local IDE, allowing you to easily see output or use a debugger. Running your program automatically uploads it to the remote and runs it there using its interpreter.
Thanks a lot! This is very helpful
Yeah I asked to make sure it was OK public, since it isn't going to be the published/used version it was fine (hence me being able to post the logins up above). I will definitely salt them as well, thanks!
My suggestions: * Don't expect it to come out perfect. It won't! * If you can really separate the UI from the rest of the game (which will be a challenge) then I'd opt for test based first. But I think that is much easier said than done. I don't love PyGame (I'd recommend Love2D!) but I think starting there is probably a safe bet. You'll find some nice example games too.
&gt; Cannot "dynamic column creation" in vanilla Peewee? To be honest, I have not used `peewee`. However, migration using it has [come up before](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/8zxiu8/any_opinions_on_migration_libraries_for_peewee/). In terms of "dynamic" column creation, I think the [Dataset "clone"](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#dataset) portion of `peewee` can do that: &gt;We can now insert() new rows into the table. If the columns do not exist, they will be created automatically 
I use python for my side hustle, but not at all at my regular job. Which means there is no question as to whether I've stolen any code from work.
Anaconda released a patch! if you re-install numpy 1.15.2 (on linux at least) you should notice that your build number goes from 1.15.2-py37h1d66e8a\_0 --&gt; 1.15.2-py37h1d66e8a\_1. Those builds aren't available on PyPi.

Oh, wow, didn't realize that was in the standard library! Cool, thanks for that. I do use 3.6 for the most part. Looks pretty solid, certainly a better choice than manually using os.urandom then.
I used to be a Perl programmer doing web development but moved over to Python while waiting for Perl6. In the meantime I've moved over to being a broadcast tech/real-time graphics specialist and I use Python because it's a good fit. I can use pure Python to manage basic file ops, use it to control any of the image libraries for simple image manipulation, have it control [Substance Automation Toolkit](https://www.allegorithmic.com/products/substance-automation-toolkit) for more complex image manipulation, then go deep and use it to automate both the [Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/) for VFX or procedural modelling, or to automate tasks in the [Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog) game engine. A few years back I made a point of learning a new language every four months. Now I've focused on just three which cover my needs- JavaScript, Python, and C++.
The post above me is correct, but I want to add some commentary about the converse. It may not be immediately obvious, but when you do the following: for i in test: print(type(i)) i=int(i) print(type(i)) each time through the loop you're implicitly setting `i = next(test_iterator)`, or taking the next item from `test` and giving it the name `i`. At this point, the variable `i` is just storing a single value, with no connection to the list `test`that it may have come from. To make a change in the "source" list `test`, you need to refer to that list somehow, as the parent comments illustrate.
&gt;Flask Webapp for calculating your total anime watch time myanimelist.net already does this and they have an API. You can just pull the anime watch time from any user's account page.
This is probably more suited for /r/learnpython 
That may well be true. In truth I no longer use it. I use rstudio for where I want the to be really interactive with the repl and small changes to scripts for rapid development of some piece of functionality. I use pycharm for other stuff. 
Because why not
Perfect interfacing language for GIS/Remote Sensing work.
I'd say work on the mechanics of the game as thoroughly as you can first, and then deal with the assets later. TBH I would play a game like this even if the graphics were dead minimal!
I guess I need to try it in Pycharm. The experience with git and Jupiter notebooks and diffing is pretty weak.
I agree with u/genjipress \- work on the mechanics and worry about the assets later. If you must absolutely use different assets right now, I would just use 2d pictures/drawings of current naval vessels until the mechanics are in place.

&gt;I'd say work on the mechanics of the game as thoroughly as you can first, and then deal with the assets later. Yeah, I feel like it worked out because I could have spent a lot of time on creating assets for something that might not have panned out. And thanks! That's actually really encouraging!
Okay, thanks for your answer! I didn't knew about asyncio, good to know about that!
I'll definitely be doing a more detailed analysis at some point. The main issue of speed I was having was due to keeping a `field of view` dictionary for each ship with up to a 15x15 grid of the surrounding area (225 items), and iterating through it to detect enemies, etc. This would happen for `n` ships, so you could see how this would get out of hand. I got this switched over to be mostly just math and a small list of found objects in the field of view, so it's a lot better. I tried implementing a threaded queue for doing some processing at one point, but to my surprise that slowed things down way more than handling the same jobs within the main game-loop.
With I/O you mean the sending of packets back and forth? Didn't even thought about that, lot to learn yet. Thanks!
Well the problem with Go is, is that it isn't as much used as Python or C++ for example. That means that there is less information to find and so when a problem occurs that I myself can't figure out, it's harder to find people with similar situations on the internet. So as a beginner, Go wouldn't be the best option in my opinion.
Welcome Mr. President
You should define a new message inside each loop. for i in results: msg = MIMEMultipart() msg['Subject'] = i['name'] msg.attach(MIMEText(json.dumps(i, ensure_ascii=False),'plain')) text = msg.as_string() server.sendmail(fromaddr, toaddr, text) 
Thanks. This would work, but I actually just figured out my mistake. According to the MimeMultiPart documentation, you need to delete headers manually as they will not overwrite. This will also save me a few lines of code :) https://docs.python.org/2/library/email.message.html#email.message.Message
Been doing a hardware deals scraping project (for Russian shops). Is fun but on way I actually spotted a good deal which I missed coz had to tide the project up and add some features here and there. I collect all the data to an sqlite db which I then render with SQL.js inside a browser. Was hard to figure it out (pretty much zero background in web tech), but now I can just get everything from the page JavaScript and it feels so good not to put any web framework into the project. I know it's kinda trashy but hey it works
If only Go had the same mathematical modules Python did.
pylint thinks you have a tuple, and it doesn't realize you have a dataframe. I'm not sure how to fix it (I'm sure there are comments or something you could place that would tell pylint to ignore it. But you don't need to use pylint - pylint is just a tool to help you find problems. You can run that example without it. I would never use pylint on interactive data anlysis, only on libraries that I'm building. &amp;#x200B;
Is your script expecting to be run from a specific working directory or making assumptions about being able to access files without fully qualified paths? You might gain some insight by redirecting the output to a log file with ‘&gt; logfile.txt’
You can pay someone $5 on fiverr to make some simple pixel assets. Coding and graphic design are universes apart as far as skill sets go, so I would learn the basics of one so you know what to expect and master the other.
The script is being run from a specific path. 
Threading can speed some things up, but keep in mind that it doesn't actually run your threads in parallel -- threads take turns executing sorta like how Windows 3.1 did it. If your threads are not I/O-bound, you'll probably see a performance loss.
I can't give you a complete answer on that, but this sounds like a use for [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/). The [page](https://avbw48ujsh.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev) should be working now.
Instead of a dict for `field of view`, could you instead use a 2D Numpy array for the battlefield? It's pretty easy to scan a 15x15 square inside a larger array for whatever you want. This would be at least 10x faster than using a dict if I'm understanding you correctly.
Well I was using the dicts for `field of view` but I stopped and switched to doing a single array containing the arena's objects. This is the entire method for updating the field of view: def _update_fov(self): self.field_of_view = [] for bot in self.arena.bots + self.arena.supplies: tr = self.target_range(bot) if tr &lt;= self.fov: self.field_of_view.append((tr, bot))
Ah, I see. I am using `threading.Thread`. That is probably why it caused such a slowdown in my project. Thanks for the heads up!
Did you use PRAW? If not how did you use a Reddit Bot?
Often when people say "Python is slow" what they mean is "there are a lot of people working in Python who don't understand fairly basic CS ideas, and write slow inefficient code." 
This script looks great. Thank you for sharing.
Nope, the tutorial is the same. I just changed the name of the database.
What? This isn't the case at all. When people say Python is slow, they mean it is slow. It is well known that Python is slow. In the sense that the same algorithm, same data structures, etc, are far more inefficient and slow than C, than Java, than JS, than other languages. Python is *usually* slower than Go as well. However, this article is also true-- it's not *too* slow for economics in most cases. And even when it is, C extensions are your friend.
It's just `pygame`'s shape drawing functions. `pygame.draw.rect`, etc.
Again, this still seems problematic and it's cleaner to just start with a new EmailMessage than modify one mail object (where you may forget to delete a header that's only sometimes added). Assuming results is something like msg = MIMEMultipart() results = [{'name': 'person1'}, {'name': 'person2'}, {'name':'person3'}] for d in results: del msg['Subject'] msg['Subject'] = d['name'] msg.attach(MIMEText(json.dumps(d, ensure_ascii=False),'plain')) text = msg.as_string() print(text) You should note that the last message (with subject 'person3') contains attachments of all three messages: Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="===============4266011278681363323==" MIME-Version: 1.0 Subject: person3 --===============4266011278681363323== Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit {"name": "person1"} --===============4266011278681363323== Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit {"name": "person2"} --===============4266011278681363323== Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit {"name": "person3"} --===============4266011278681363323==-- 
It's definitely slower than something like Java, or C++. No argument at all. My point is that in most people's use cases, they don't need to raw speed that using a statically typed, complied language provides. It's like people who think Python is easy to learn. It's not. It's easy to get started in. And it's easier (or at the very least less verbose) than Java/C++, but that doesn't mean that it's easy.
The article is also showcasing the benefits of the Numba JIT compiler. If Numba can compile your code then it runs freakishly quickly, without having to turn to C extensions.
Irrelevant to my response but wtf is going on with your spacing. The raw text has a newline in "C++". And perhaps, but this post is response to a paper that compares benchmarks of languages and says "given these benchmarks Python is too slow for economics". And this response says "this paper doesn't make any sense, by their own data it beat a Julia benchmark. Furthermore, such delays are insignificant in most cases for economics. But when people call Python slow, they don't mean it due to implentation stupidity.
Didn't know about Zappa. Thanks for the pointer.
&gt; This isn't the case at all At all? It's at least partly the case.
Good, a grid is much better here than a bunch of dicts. But perhaps you might consider updating FOV differently. AFAICT, you update each bot's FOV one at a time, so you end up calculating n*(n+m) distances where n is the number of bots and m is the number of supplies. So instead of looping over all of the other objects (bots + supples) and getting their distance, you might be able to improve things a lot by just looking at the array cells in the FOV around the bot you're updating and adding any objects you find there to the FOV list. So instead of looping over objects and seeing if they are within distance, you might consider looping over grid cells within distance to see if they contain any objects.
This is why people use Python, and also R. I do think that Julia is promising, but it will take a lot of time for it to come even close to the ecosystem the other two languages have.

I'm working on analyzing Jenkins Job failures and using collection distance to determine how alike errors are. This will hopefully allow me to group similar errors together. 
I will still have to calculate distances somehow. Are you saying a structure like: grid = [[], [], [], []] then using coordinates to search the specific lists? Wouldn't slicing the lists create a new copy of that part of the grid to search resulting in n*(row_search_space*rows) where `row_search_space` is the length of the array slice? 
I'm not an expert at the performance of packet transmission so I don't know how much of a bottleneck it is. What I have in mind is database access. It's basically all about reading data that is stored on a hard drive and managed by another application (database system). If you're going to create some complex sql queries and expect them to be run often, then the programming language you have chosen will not have a meaningful impact.
I'm hoping I did this semi-correctly. As I mentioned before I'm pretty novice, I only wrote my first line of code around a month ago, so take it easy on me please, I know it's at least a little rough in some places. from bs4 import BeautifulSoup # Imports HTML File from desktop with open('C:/Users/sunga/Desktop/102.htm') as html_file: soup = BeautifulSoup(html_file, 'lxml') # Grabs the Table Rows from website and puts them into a list of lists containing all information about tables data = [] for tr2 in soup.find_all('tr', {'class': 'cc_h cc_g skin__table-row'}): values = [td3.text for td3 in tr2.find_all('td')] data.append(values) # Filters the tables that have seated players # Here the 4th element of every list in the list contained Players/Flop (Always less than 100 when active table active) not_empty = [] for x in data: if len(x[4]) &lt; 3: not_empty.append(x) # Deletes some miscellaneous information from table lists that I didn't want. # These were things like a spacing row, Hands/Hr and something else I can't remember, deleted here in first three 'fors' # The 'if y' section adds a new element to each list of table information, (It assigns a BB value to the table) # the X float section directly below converts the Average Pot Size to a float, rather than a string element in the list # The final section here divides the AVP by the BB element we created, and adds an element that is BB/Pot to table lists for x in not_empty: del x[0] for x in not_empty: del x[1] for x in not_empty: del x[2] for x in not_empty: y = x[1] if y[4] == '2': x.append(2) if y[4] == '5': x.append(0.5) if y[3] == '5': x.append(1) if y[4] == '4': x.append(4) if y[3] == '1': x.append(0.2) for x in not_empty: x[2] = float(x[2]) for x in not_empty: bb = x[2] / x[4] x.append(bb) # sorts the lists of tables by their BB/Pot in reverse order and prints them. not_empty.sort(key=lambda x: x[5], reverse=True) for x in not_empty: print(x)
Well, you did format it. So far so good. But it would be more pleasant to read if you’d just indent your code with 4 spaces. #Then it looks like this import this def this_is_readable(): pass
Like this?? from bs4 import BeautifulSoup # Imports HTML File from desktop with open('C:/Users/sunga/Desktop/102.htm') as html_file: soup = BeautifulSoup(html_file, 'lxml') # Grabs the Table Rows from website and puts them into a list of lists containing all information about tables data = [] for tr2 in soup.find_all('tr', {'class': 'cc_h cc_g skin__table-row'}): values = [td3.text for td3 in tr2.find_all('td')] data.append(values) # Filters the tables that have seated players # Here the 4th element of every list in the list contained Players/Flop (Always less than 100 when active table active) not_empty = [] for x in data: if len(x[4]) &lt; 3: not_empty.append(x) # Deletes some miscellaneous information from table lists that I didn't want. # These were things like a spacing row, Hands/Hr and something else I can't remember, deleted here in first three 'fors' # The 'if y' section adds a new element to each list of table information, (It assigns a BB value to the table) # the X float section directly below converts the Average Pot Size to a float, rather than a string element in the list # The final section here divides the AVP by the BB element we created, and adds an element that is BB/Pot to table lists for x in not_empty: del x[0] for x in not_empty: del x[1] for x in not_empty: del x[2] for x in not_empty: y = x[1] if y[4] == '2': x.append(2) if y[4] == '5': x.append(0.5) if y[3] == '5': x.append(1) if y[4] == '4': x.append(4) if y[3] == '1': x.append(0.2) for x in not_empty: x[2] = float(x[2]) for x in not_empty: bb = x[2] / x[4] x.append(bb) # sorts the lists of tables by their BB/Pot in reverse order and prints them. not_empty.sort(key=lambda x: x[5], reverse=True) for x in not_empty: print(x)

I'm actually looking into that a little bit. Currently unfamiliar with which languages would be useful (I've seen only a little bit of Javascript, haven't actually written a single line of it.) I've started watching YouTube tutorials though, so would love direction to any useful information. 
Beginners class - know nothing about python and how it works so take it easy on me
only if they import uuid1 from my package. If they want the original implementation they should import it from uuid. Unless you're wondering about the "import *" people, which is not a best practice.
You’re calling “pygame.display.update()” over and over and over again in an unbounded loop. Pretty good recipe for an unresponsive app!

You probably want to handle input in some way: for event in pygame.event.get(): if event.type == QUIT: return
So what do I have to edit?
 cd to that path before running the executable.
Side hustle? Go on....
So that's kind of the part I've been apprehensive about trying. I've done some limited work with request trying to scrape webpages; however some of the webpages (reddit to be exact) were sending a message that said that it looked like they were being contacted by a bot (the python program) and to wait two seconds yadda yadda to retry, so I was hesitant to try to use requests on the actual poker website, in fear that they'd detect me, I have no idea what their reaction would be, but I assume they'd think I was being more nefarious than I am being.
&gt; Python combined with its scientific libraries Those libraries written in C and Fortran, for some mysterious reason?
What browser are you using?
Chrome
Is it really? I check it out, and looked like chaos. A language the runs in jvm but also transpiles to javascript and can be compiled to a single binary too. Woah. Checked a simple hello world and it's syntax looked ugly/pointless to me with a Python/C point of view. :(
Eh IMO it's Java with some C++ and Scala syntactic sugar.
Wait, it transpiles to JS?
When you go to the network tab and submit your loin data you should a new request appear. Click on it and navigate to the `headers` tab. 
You are probably actually looking for multiprocessing. It is also built in to python. Threading in python is not as you would think.

This is kind of inspiring actually. I've been contemplating doing something similar - less strategy and more simulation. Wanted to try to simulate shipping routes in a solar system, accounting for positions and planets and delta-v minimization and such. Wanted to figure out exactly how unlikely it was that piracy could occur in the solar system. I've only ever gotten as far as populating data structures. :)
Nicely done so far! Minimal can have its charm. 
alright, I think I've almost got it, my brain feels a little fried though. Can you elaborate a little bit on the 'res =' and 'token =' lines? So for the res =... this is the site that I used to login in order to get all my post information and yadda yadda correct? On the token section I think I'm lost. How do I scrape the token from the original site? as for the rest, I've got a dictionary set up with my login data, (and the token to be scraped token.) and then I've got the URL that we got before that was under the Post Header, is this all correct so far?
I suppose you read into the requests documentation a bit. `s.get` returns a response object, so does `s.get`. `scrape_csrf_token()` is just a placeholder for a function that scrapes the token. To see where the token is on the page, you could load the login page, view it’s source, login and then look for the token from the post data in the previously loaded source. Then you know where to look for it.
Dislike that it can’t give you exact measurements on where you went wrong in your code but still gives you an area
TBH, this kind of arguments are only relevant to puritans. People are going to use the language that they feel comfortable with. It does not matter whether the language is written using itself or something else. Fanboys are going to be fanboys. No matter what martian technology a new language is based on, if it's not easy to work with, people will not use it.

Glad I could help :P That would be an interesting simulation for sure. It would be fun to know how much traffic there would need to be for there to be an actual risk of piracy.
I added stderr support to [arepl](https://github.com/almenon/arepl-vscode), my python vscode extension. I'll be at pygotham if anyone is interested :)
I think it is more of a delta-v problem. In order to intercept a ship, you need to be moving at the same velocity as it. So hijacking in transit becomes a very expensive endeavour. So, assuming you have a small ship that is cheap to match a course with, you have to grapple, dock, invade a cargo ship. Then, because the cargo ship likely only has enough fuel to brake at its destination, you'd only be able to redirect it someplace if that place had a lower delta-v than your current destination. Or you'd run out of fuel and be stranded forever. So the optimal place for piracy is probably at the docks where ships are being loaded. Steel the ship fully loaded, with full fuel, and take it somewhere else where the delta-v is less than the original destination. So, ideally, something in the asteroid belt bound for an inner planet, or similar. But there might be ways to do it in transit for certain origins and destinations. And it would be fun to try to figure that out. Anyway, I don't know if I'll ever finish the project - just a pet project :)
Soooooo... git link? :)

Crash Course in Python and Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python. Granted, I just have a problem I need to solve that requires in-depth python knowledge.
Awesome! And great job! One question... inspired by EVE?
Instead of IPs, use MAC addresses since they're unique to each device.
I feel like I might be misunderstanding something here, but in your code sample field_of_view is a `list`, not a `dict`. Adding to a dict object and checking if something is inside are both `O(1)` operations in Python, which is about as fast as you can go. Checking a list is `O(n)`, which is going to be significantly slower. Additionally, adding to a list can vary from `O(1)` to `O(n)` depending on what operations you are using (I see you are using `append` which is O(1), so thats good). You could quickly scan the dict for object in field of view using something like: self.field_of_view = {"ship": set(someShip1, someShip2)} for obj in ["ship","supply","mothership"]: self.field_of_view.get(obj,False) Also, if possible use `set()` over `list()`, as sets of an O(1) lookup when using the `in` operator. This will be much, much faster than iterating through a list of items and comparing them for whatever youre looking for. Heres the numbers: https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity
Will you put the code on GitHub?
Will you share the code?
Every device on my network has statically assigned IPs, so in my case that *shouldn't* matter. But you're absolutely right. In a case where I was using only DHCP then MAC addresses would be better. In either case I guess it's possible to IP and MAC spoof, so in all reality I guess it wouldn't be too difficult if you really wanted to get on unnoticed.
Open-source the code so others can help
you could squeeze even more speed out of the @jit function by typing inputs and outputs. It can be tempermental, but when it works you can get decent speed increases.

Alright, so I've now written a regex that finds the csrf on the website. key = str(re.findall(r'loginToken\s=\s.{38}', str(res))) token = key[16:52] This took forever as I was originally using BeautifulSoup however the token is buried beneath a script tag that is a bunch of places on the page, so I wasn't able to get it that way. So unbelievably frustrating. Anyhow I just tried to run this program import requests import re s = requests.Session() res = s.get("https://loginwebsite") print(res) key = str(re.findall(r'loginToken\s=\s.{38}', str(res))) token = key[16:52] print(token) and I'm currently getting a 405 response. Note that this site is just the site that has the login page. So I was just really testing to see if I could connect. Anyhow I really appreciate your help. For now, will probably read through the requests documentation like you said, and watch some more tutorials. Can't believe how mentally fatiguing it is to try and figure this stuff out and continuously hit brick walls. I'm gonna go have a beer and play some live poker. Thanks again, I'll try to touch base tomorrow. 
yeahp. pm8k explained it. `2 * * * *` This means it will run at 00:02, 01:02, 02:02, .... 23:02; this is to run "every minute", it means everytime system clock "minute" ticks, it will execute `* * * * *` to run it every 2 min should look like: `*/2 * * * *` 
Yes this is part two and follows on from the last article.
I just finished off making a web scraper for work, so that we can collect data from a website that doesn't have an export option.

Since programming isn’t an everyday thing for me I like that Python is easy to remember and has few gotchas to forget about. Given that I’m really thinking that Swift has long term potential that Python will never have. Of all of the “new” languages out there Swift seems to have the best potential to be the easy and fun language Python is. It doesn’t hurt that Swift borrows much from Python. In any event back to Python, one biggy that leads to Python happiness is the large collection of libraries out there. Literally a solution for just about every need. This is a huge factor and is precisely why I choose it for a number of projects. Need to write a CAD file of some sort, no problem there is a lib for that. A lib for everything really, even for things I don’t understand. In any event I have to agree with the thought that Python is fun. Fun comes from simplicity that allows you to focus on your application. The only thing that I hate about Python is the delimnating program block be indentation. That has lead to some serious bugs. Frankly my IT courses started with Modula2 and as such I’m a begin and end sort of guy. If not text labels at least good old “{ &amp; }”!! For me anyways indentation is Pythons weak link. 
The right answer is to speak to your manager about getting permission to install it.
Try `concurrent.futures` instead, with `ProcessPoolExecutor` for CPU-intensive tasks.
You don't need admin access anymore to install python. I think that's in 3.4+. There are admin protected folders though (e.g., programfiles and C), so make sure it's under your user directory, so C:\\users\me\documents\python36 or similar.
You can also "freeze" the application into an executable, like an *.exe on Windows using cx_freeze, pyinstaller, py2exe, etc, and then make that executable accessible with a network location.
I mean, if you're not writing machine code, you're just just not living

Worked on automating my mornings at work by opening the monitoring dashboards i normally go to and logging them into my time tracking...I hate time tracking. I'm also working on a script to fill out a form that normally gets filled out when a hard drive gets sanitized. I have over 200 drives of different makes/models and serial numbers that i would need to enter manually over the course of a week or two, that should be cut down to about 30 minutes once the script is complete.

I just Googled "python tor scraping" and this is what came up https://github.com/bdheath/pytor
&gt; from the things i've read, javascript in node.js is faster than python, is this true? Faster than CPython, (a particular, but very popular, implementation of Python), when doing certain things (but not other things). PyPy could be faster for doing other things (faster than Node.js). There are some technical things that Python can do, while JavaScript cannot, but they aren't very important. For example, objects in Python implemented in such a way that you can inherit from multiple superclasses, while, in JavaScript, prototype must point to a single superclass. But, is this difference really important to anyone? -- Well, no. All modern popular languages gradually converge to some middle-ground inconsistent feature bloat. So, whatever the distinctions between Python and JavaScript are today, a year from now, there may be 10% less of those, and in 10 years, maybe 50% less. --- The question you really should be asking is: I want to write X-kind of program, are there any good libraries that will help me to write less code (solve less problems in order to achieve the goal)? Sometimes JavaScript will have those, other times Python, or maybe both, or neither.

Oh
One line functions aren't separate logic.
Specifically in Python? It's a clutch. Because Python has no real parallelism, but it wants to have one, people have been struggling to come up with workarounds which would prevent them from changing the core of the language. But, technically, there aren't any "async functions" in Python. `async` makes a function into a future / task / generator / blob of goo, whichever terminology you use, it's not a function anymore. So, a better question to ask would be: why cannot you await any function, not just the one declared to be async? And the answer would be: bad planning / lack of foresight. But, this has been done repeatedly in Python, so, at least, in lack of foresight, Python is consistent. It is very similar to how you cannot use any function as a generator: it must have a yield keyword in it, or return a generator created by another function. Same, as you cannot use any function to create context manager and so on.
This recommendation is of the highest quality. It menaces with spikes of FUN.

Yarp! https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/javascript/kotlin-to-javascript/kotlin-to-javascript.html
It currently has a small but dedicated group of people developing libraries, including some really impressive ones for numerical computing. If it wants a mainstream future it should probably work on its libraries for data science, machine learning and statistics, as that’s where the user numbers are. So it needs its own Numpy/Pandas or Tidyverse libraries. It has good interoperability with Python and R though so you can dip into those ecosystems relatively easily for now. So far it’s looking like interest is growing slowly but surely, but only time will tell if it can keep up interest of developers.
I'm sorry you don't like the bots action, and I fully acknowledge it makes mistakes in some cases. But in this case, I agree with the bots decision to post a comment, and I stand by the words in the bots post. 
Oh, but this isn't part of the standard build process-- just an option? That I can understand-- Kotlin compiles into Java bytecode generally and that's not *too* different than Java source code, and generally speaking any language can transpile into another. The bigger question is why is it an option right out of the box...
urllib, urllib2 or requests are all packages which can be used for webscraping
That may be the opinion of a few short sighted people. However if people evaluate the language objectively they will realize that at the moment Swift is the best of the modern language solutions. To look at it another way where would Python be today if programmers closed their minds to the possibilities of a well designed scripting language?

The TEI covers many use cases in the fields of digital humanities, research, linguistics, science, etc, many of these cases needing a fine qualification of parts of the text... and this is something which needs a rich vocabulary of elements and attributes (no, html is not enough for this). Do you have anything substantial to contribute (i.e. a real alternative) or are you just in a "I don't need this so nobody should need this" mindset ? You don't have to answer, at this point you already made the point about your ignorance.

We're talking about three different build processes to put it simple: * building for JVM * building for system (standalone) * building for browser (javascript) These targets are independent from each other, but once again, I'm no expert at Kotlin, just interested in new languages. If you compile kotlin to Java bytecode, I'm pretty sure it'll look similar to something compiled from Java. Why shouldn't it be an option? To me, it looks like a great simplification for full-stack developers. Basically, you can use the same language to build both the backend and the frontend. That's a massive advantage. And if you can (I'm not sure about the limitations) build a desktop client for your web-based app with Kotlin, you're absolutely winning. Oh, and Kotlin is natively supported on Android.

So is the issue that your script fails to run when you schedule it in something like a cronjob for whatever reason? Maybe your environment isn't set up correctly and it can't load your dependency 
This is a nice change as it makes the collections namespace clearer. While they're at it,they should also: * move typing.NamedTuple over to collections.NamedTuple * move types.SimpleNameSpace over to collections.SimpleNameSpace * Move types.MappingProxyType over to collection.MappingProxy In this way, all the important collections types would be in their logical location, IMO.
If the database isn't implemented properly, the API may fail. If you don't have it at all it can still work.
I made a script that binds python scripts and executable files to hotkeys of your choosing. It's got a gui and everything. It comes pre-loaded with two scripts I made, one that automates mouse clicks and another that checks if there are any new xkcd comics since you last ran the script. I'm planning on making the xkcd one check other stuff too, and if anyone has any ideas for webcomics or websites I should add functionality for I'd love to hear your suggestions, not just on that but also if there are other handy scripts you think it should come with. By all means, give it a try and if anyone has any ideas on how I can improve anything, please tell me!

Nice! For what it's worth, I recommend to always use the [ISO 8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). 
**ISO 8601** ISO 8601 Data elements and interchange formats – Information interchange – Representation of dates and times is an international standard covering the exchange of date- and time-related data. It was issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was first published in 1988. The purpose of this standard is to provide an unambiguous and well-defined method of representing dates and times, so as to avoid misinterpretation of numeric representations of dates and times, particularly when data are transferred between countries with different conventions for writing numeric dates and times. In general, ISO 8601 applies to representations and formats of dates in the Gregorian (and potentially proleptic Gregorian) calendar, times based on the 24-hour timekeeping system (with optional time zone information, e. g. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

To get it to hex: ``` 'python'.encode('utf-8').hex() ``` Or if you want it exactly: ``` print(''.join([f'\\x{ord(c):x}' for c in 'python'])) ``` But it's always better to ask these kinds of questions on stackoverflow.

Yes, I used PRAW but forgot to add it to the list.
Haven't read your project in detail, but it comes to me that `sqrt()` would be an unnecessary extra step when its use is only for comparison, especially if you are performing `sqrt()` repeatedly.

How would you define layers.yml in Django? I can't get it to check that no app imports from another app lower than it. I currently have: &amp;#x200B; Django App Layers: packages: \- app1 \- app2 layers: \- urls \- views \- forms \- models &amp;#x200B; I can only give one app as argument, like layer-lint app2, but I want it to check all apps. How to do this?

interesting, but I would be worried about using normal filesystem tools to manage the files afterwards. how would you copy all your image files for a year into a single dir if you wanted to do that in future? with a lot of images you ru nthe risk of filename collisions. I would have kept the original filenames as well as moving them into the illustrated structure.
I adapted something similar (although it's in JS) from matt.stumpnet.net, but it may give you some ideas on how to do graphics in a minimal fashion: [http://quickmind.co.uk/tank.html](http://quickmind.co.uk/tank.html) &amp;#x200B;
I just started learning python using the Python Crash Course book, along C in class. Am also taking trig at the moment. Made a tiny script that runs in terminal to quickly find co-terminal angles.
An option would be to normalize them to a common format you're sure won't result in clashes. Since 'VID_' and '.mp4' seem to be redundant, you could remove the prefix. But definitely keep the year and month, and you might want something beyond the minute level if they come from different sources and might clash. 
Slick tool! I like the presentation and the cleanliness of its interface. &amp;#x200B; One thing I would definitely recommend is putting the calls to copyerino() in a block that will only execute in the main namespace (like when you run it as a script): &amp;#x200B; if \_\_name\_\_ == '\_\_main\_\_': \# main runtime here copyerino('images', \*structured\_collection(pictures)) copyerino('videos', \*structured\_collection(videos)) &amp;#x200B; The reason you would want to do this is in case you decide to extend this tool, you may want to import pictory into other places. When python imports a module, it will execute anything in that module that it can so you should hide main runtime stuff in an if statement (or separate the logic from the script running into different files). &amp;#x200B; If you really really want to share it with the world, make a setup file! If you've never done it before, it's a good exercise... plus after you do it, you'll be able to upload it to pypi and tell people to just pip install it.
Are you pulling the repo into `..\Lib\site-packages\` with git/source-tree? Is your goal to edit the backtrader package? Then I think what you really want is to pull the repo to some place you can work with it (usually under `documents` or `projects` or something) and then ask pip to install that directory, maybe even editable so your changes are available without asking pip to reinstall: `pip install -e .`
I like it, way faster than python is. I AHK the "generics" and go about my day. 
I use pyinstaller. It's trivial to hook up to github release and have automatic updating that checks for new releases and installs the latest. If you write your code to be cross platform you can release Mac + Windows + Linux binaries.
What do the directories taste like? 
if you're on a mac, you can use crontab.
Yeah, if you are comparing to a fixed distance it is faster to compare to a precomputed distance² than doing the sqrt().
Are you just organising the pictures and videos by date? I have manually sorted all my photos (still a working progress) but I sort them by event. So this wouldn't work. Still not sure what method for sorting is best since often I'm left with un-event-able pictures (pictures that don't fit into any event). I'm also about to start working on a program that finds duplicate pictures based on the pixels and not filename. 
I will eventually, but right now it's still full of bad code and hardcoded credentials.
Does crontab require my computer to be on when the job runs?
Well, that's a lot of what doesn't work but not much better at helping to understand what you're trying to accomplish. From what I understand you don't need help with anything Python. What you need help with is scheduling the execution of a working Python script? It seems your Google Foo needs some work. There are answers to each of these questions. Just one quick one is: - AWS Lambda and Twilio: https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/05/send-sms-text-messages-aws-lambda-python-3-6.html If you want to go the AWS route you could also use their SNS service instead of Twilio. For using your Mac there are plenty of results on setting up Cron to run the script. If it's not working you need to make sure your script has been made executable (chmod +x) and that you have a shebang line at the top telling the system that it's Python and which Python interpreter to use. See: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/appendixb/ I hope some of this helps.
Nice points. Yep, maybe if I make the tool more robust I can evolve it into a pipable package.
Tase like folders.
This helps me to organize pictures by event cause having them in separate month directories would be easier to split daily ones and store in different "events" directories. But yeah, it simply organizes the pictures and videos by date.
I've noticed while organizing my own photos that there is a discrepancy between when a photo was taken and when it was sent to me. So let's say 2 people (me and a friend) take a photo on the same day, my friend sends me his photo the next day, itll come up on my computer that the pictures were takin on different days. Have you come across this issue?
I sort them by their names.. Usually photos (at least the ones from my phone) are saved in a specific name pattern.. This pattern has the full date (from year to seconds) of the moment the photo was taken.
ayy!
Ok, this wouldn't work for me, since many of my photos are raking on different devices and shared. They do not share any naming pattern. Thank you though and nice job!

The login page returns a `405` when using `s.get`? If it does, you could just try to get all the request data your browser sends in a fresh request (all cookies deleted etc.), including headers and paste it into your request. Another last option would be to login from your browser, get the session data (session-id cookie and what else is stored after the login) and is this data to forge your requests. Not a great solution for automation, but if this works it would narrow down the scope of where the bug is
I wrote a similar program for my DSLR photography and iPhone photos. I used the EXIF data instead. You might want to look into the Pillow Module if you want to expand your program. Here is a link to the Module. https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/5.3.x/
&gt; Well cpython is written in C too. What's your point? Python is too slow for CPU-bound software. &gt; Focusing on the implementation language of the python modules you use doesn't really make sense. It does, when you're discussing Language implementation performance and efficiency. &gt; You as the end-programmer are writing python regardless and that's what matters. You as the oblivious end-user are writing shell commands to launch those Python scripts, so Bash is the greatest interpreter ever.

There's a video on how to learn python in 5 minutes on youtube. It hits the nail right on the head of how to get started. It's pretty good. The biggest hurdle is not the exercises. It's just getting started. Even if your the perfect teacher and had the best material covered every little thing their not gonna remember it. The lesson they need to learn is how do I solve a problem that I don't have answers to. There is always a lack of answers but there is always a way to make it happen.
So how do I find the distance between 2 coordinates given the information? I do have `Arena.grid` where `grid` is a `dict` containing `x` `y` coordinates like `grid[x][y]`. Should I just use subtraction and absolute value to find the distance instead of `sqrt`?
Let the flamewar on 2.7 start

Sweet. Thanks! 
the result is a string. any way this can be done to bytes?
Absolutely. I think it's interesting that so many tests run Julia code once, when it is clearly meant to optimize for multiple runs. The first execution includes compilation time. Subsequent runs just run the pre-compiled code. Now, in speed tests, does ANYONE include the compilation time for any other language? Anyone? Comparisons of compilation time are pretty few and far between, right? Now, I don't know if this article or the one its responding to committed this error and misrepresentation, but to sit back and complain that Julia is "as slow as Python" on first execution is omitting that it's generally as fast as C on those subsequent pre-compiled runs. Amortized across a large number of executions, Julia gets closer and closer to C on average/overall runtime. Reminds me a bit of those proud Matlab developers who'd re-invented memoization over the last few years. 
&gt;the result is a string. any way this can be done to bytes? &amp;#x200B;
Is lice? Ha
So I assume that when you run the thing it generally does what is expected. By breaking it you are attempts Ng to make it not run. I.e that variable superSillyString = "Stringy Thingy" that you declared earlier and are manipulating in function def stupidFunck() : superSillyString = "changed" print(superSillyString) well change the stuff in the function like the name etc. Sorry for the crude reply I am using the app.
The reports contain mostly charts and tables and are used by management to track their budgets throughout the fiscal year. For a laundry list of odd reasons, prior to the web app they were manually created in excel each month. In the web app a template is created for each type of chart/table, and those templates are combined into a report template. Then a filter is applied to the report template so that it displays the info specific to each department and account series or whatever combo the user wants. All filters are stored within the urlConf so the user can bookmark or share their report. Since all the data is provided on web app instead of select high level info on a static report, the user can also investigate granular budget issues without needing to request additional reports. All the reports can be saved as pdf and the tables can be export to excel. So now each month we just need to update the reporting database with the new data and everything else is automatically uodated.
The distance between point A and B is calculated by d = sqrt((Ax- Bx)² + (Ay-By)²). So to find if d1&gt;d2 is the same as computing d1²&gt;d2², therefore you can omit the sqrt(). There is no need of absolute value because the value inside the sqrt will be allways postive. 
Curious about what your purpose here is? If you only want a view of the table every Sunday night (for example), then you could write a statement for that and run it on a cron job. If you want to be able to look back at any given time (snapshot at 2018/09/27 08:38:00 AM), then you would need something like sql-continuum which tracks all changes to a db. I've not used either library myself, but contiuum looks to have more support. Our history tables are implemented on a scheduled basis in-db as opposed to by sqla.
&gt;Languages are tools, get over it and stop being fundamentalist orthodox programmers, Jesus. This is true.
2¢: The regular old `array` functions built into Python may work well too, depending on what you're storing in them. NumPy is useful but it adds a lot to the size of the program's redistributable.

Technically yes, however etymology is not a well paying profession
&gt; &gt; dynamically typed &gt; &gt; Is a meaningless word combination used by people who know very little about types. That's simply not true. Certainly people often confuse dynamic typing and weak typing (and I've no idea what point OP was trying to make), but dynamic typing really is a thing, both in the programming language theory community and in the (connected) type theory community. See, e.g. [the dynamically-typed lambda calculus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167642394000042). 
Unicode is unicode. Also, how do you propose one write a program with an emoji menu without using emoji?
&gt; a program with an emoji menu How about a program without an emoji menu?
Why not?
Could you provide some reasoning or justification for your seemingly silly and incorrect statement? Because I'm pretty sure you absolutely *should* write code with emojis
Yes 👏 I 👏 could. 👏
It basically means test your program with inputs that are at the boundaries of what it can handle. Try to find "gaps" in your logic. It might work for the specific case you've tested, but there could be conditions under which the program would produce the wrong result. Part of writing a good program is anticipating thr ways it could break. Some examples: If your program asks the user to input a number, see what happens if you type in text. If your program reads text from a file, try providing a file with unicode characters. If you are iterating through files in a directory, what happens if the directory doesn't exist or is empty? Can you find some set of conditions that would cause a variable not to be set? 
something something datascience
&gt; etymology is not a well paying profession What does this mean. You're a professional "etymologist"?
Programmer convenience. async definitions + event loop creates more readable code. The point of this stuff is just to not have to wait for your database or network connection to get back to you. Gevent is great if you don't have a lot of these connections in my opinion, but if thats the whole point of your module, then async labelling makes it clear what futures you're waiting for and what should be processed linearly.
I think the real question should be: _are these scientific libraries flexible enough for all use cases of computational economy?_ If they are, then one could pick Python for their computational economy needs, knowing that these libraries got them covered and they can do anything with decent performance using these libraries. If these libraries are not flexible enough, picking Python means you risk encountering cases where you have to either settle on performance or write your own extension in a faster language. This may or may not be acceptable, and you need to know it beforehand when deciding what language to use.
IO is a bottleneck for python due to the GIL. Asyncio helps you escape that by letting other code run while youre still waiting on IO (ie no new incoming data)
Any security concerns with this change? 
It's always good to test if 💻 is 🐧 and return 💩 otherwise. :D
Officially or third party? I couldn't find anything on the website, but I know of a github repo of python bindings.
Wallaroo was already all "source available" so that everything was open. There shouldn't be any security concern from this change. If someone had a security concern before, they'd still have it now. There shouldn't however, be any new ones.
I guess you wouldn't need emoji for that. I'm beginning to think you're not expressing an opinion about programming so much as you're expressing an opinion against emoji in general... Do I have that right, grandpa?

Don't use emojicode then
&gt; In every Alembic codebase I've seen, people don't bother with reversions. I believe you just stated more than you realize. In one wave of the hand you justified your position by rejecting significant features of value to many others. &gt; Really? I find that when I'm developing new features, database changes are often involved. Yes, really. Frequently developers who are making changes to the schema either have their own instance. Others don't require those changes until it's time to merge the codebases. Which in turn requires a merging of the schema. Thusly the value of Alembic. I could keep going and going but the differences appear to be one entirely predicated upon a vast difference in development, management, deployment, and support. Along will all of those corresponding workflows. It doesn't mean you're doing something wrong. But it does mean you preaching that everyone is doing it wrong is, frankly, invalid. 
I don't see any problem with it. They're built-in functions, intended to be used. Only options I know of for that getattr usage are: * You wrote the class definition. Set the object to default to None in the definition. * You didn't write the class definition. Use getattr as you are and be happy. With setattr I'm pretty sure you can just do: obj.attr = value They're both valid though.

You should be able to modify the file like that without an external library. I haven't messed with PowerPoint file internals though, so I can't say how difficult it would be to figure out what exactly needs to be done.

If you want bytes in python 3 do: ``` &gt;&gt;&gt; 'python'.encode('utf-8') b'python' ``` The [https://docs.python.org/3.7/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals](python 3.7 docs) says: "Bytes literals are always prefixed with 'b' or 'B'; they produce an instance of the bytes type instead of the str type. They may only contain ASCII characters; bytes with a numeric value of 128 or greater must be expressed with escapes." So all ascii characters are always displayed whereas others are escaped: ``` &gt;&gt;&gt; '€'.encode('utf-8') b'\xe2\x82\xac' ``` Is it clearer?

But this dynamic typing has absolutely nothing to do with whatever OP could possibly mean. It is just a coincidence that the same word combination was chosen to denote something completely unrelated. &gt; Well, nitpicking, but your example allows me to add an integer to an istr, not to a str No, it allows you add to a particular case of `str` to integer. This is ensured by the mechanism, in OO world known as "inheritance". The contract of inheritance is that `istr` **is a** `str`. &gt; Wrong in that the standard library is not part of the language No, you are wrong. The language is defined by its standard. Standard defines what things are part of the language. Therefore the **standard** library is part of the language. That's immediate from definition.
I just tried running the repl (https://repl.it/@MikeShi42/CartPole), but the hammer doesn't move much (it just jiggles :/ )
It looks really good, but I would say that you should look into not having all the code in an \_\_init\_\_.py file - split it up into files for clarity, especially as it grows and gets larger. &amp;#x200B; The code is well written and clean. I think that there is a lot of good that can come out of it! 
I had the same problem with AWS Lambda and external dependencies. Finally, I found this [Serverless Plugin](https://serverless.com/blog/serverless-python-packaging/), which lets you run a script with dependencies on AWS Lambda.
So a list up to 65536 would cover numbers up to 2\^32? Also, some of the numbers just were primes, so would you deal with numbers that are themselves primes?

&gt; t there's also no real upside to it IMHO (i.e. anaconda only kinda made sense on windows prior to binary wheels), but plenty of cons[1] to using it on Linux/OSX where it's always been easy to install from source or a package manager. As an aside, I also haven't used anaconda on windows since binary wheels were allowed on pypi. Anaconda is compiled with GCC 7.2 and 7.3 in Linux, we also have GCC 8.2 in testing. We also take extensive care of performance, stability and compatibility across a range of OSes and distros. You can read more about some of the advantages of Anaconda on linux, macOS and Windows here: https://www.anaconda.com/blog/developer-blog/utilizing-the-new-compilers-in-anaconda-distribution-5/ .. and here: https://www.anaconda.com/blog/developer-blog/tensorflow-in-anaconda/ .. we also jump on critical bugs as quickly as we can, most recently: https://www.opensourceanswers.com/blog/you-shouldnt-use-python-37-for-data-science-right-now.html .. so our millions of users can happily take advantage of Python 3.7 and numpy without running into this problem. Please stop spreading old information.
&gt; doesn't link system-level shared libraries Incorrect, we link selectively to a known range of CentOSt6 system libraries, in particular your system X11 and graphics stack, however, given our mission to provide the latest software for data science we like to provide our own well built versions which we know to be compatible with the rest of our stack. &gt; conda envs superfluous with venv, etc. Conda envs are superior to venv, supporting mixing of e.g. Python and R in the same environment as well as being able to handle C/C++ (what you may call 'system' libraries) and now also rust (here we provide our own toolchain activation script so that rust will find and link to our libraries).
Maybe this wrapper will make things better: class ObjAsDict: def __init__(self, obj): self.obj = obj def __getitem__(self, key): return ObjAsDict(getattr(self.obj, key)) def get(self, key, default=None): return ObjAsDict(getattr(self.obj, key, default)) def __setitem__(self, key, value): if isinstance(value, ObjAsDict): value = value.obj setattr(self, key, value) So, instead of: getattr(getattr(my_obj, attr1), attr2, None) You could write: ObjAsDict(my_obj)[attr1].get(attr2, None).obj And setattr(getattr(my_obj, attr1), attr2, my_value) Will become ObjAsDict(my_obj)[attr1][attr2] = my_value 
i don't know that this is what you're looking for, but i've used toolz (particularly toolz.flip and toolz.curry) to just define a getattr one-liner for commonly-used attributes.

This is the second time in a weeks span that this bot replied because 'help me' was in the title. This, (and the other post) are the first two posts in the span of a bit over three months (the period the automatic response has been active) where 'help me' was used in the title but the post was not requesting help. Good to know. Please downvote this bots comment, it makes metrics on my end easier, and hopefully will make the bot function better in the future. And OP, solid project! I especially like the explanation below most of the functions. It's a tough habit to maintain, but it's a really good one, keep it up!

Python is not specifically web focused. You can do web stuff with it. If you're talking about jobs, then it's data science, build configuration, and research focused. 
First, these are two very different things. Python can be used for the web but can be and is used for almost anything else. Look into it’s applications and modern uses in programming. You can’t go wrong with learning python. 
They both do the same thing though, why would one be preferred over the other? 
Debugging the site is the first challenge. &gt;:D
Pretty cool, just did it. Hopefully i win something

With respect, that's a fallacy. To claim something has problems while knowing nothing of it is a very strange claim to make
Another tip which doesn't completely solve this problem but helps a bit is to use the DuckDuckGo `!py` or `!py2` bang when searching for documentation. For example, `!py math` searches the Python 3 documentation for math, and the `math` module is the first result. Sometimes the Python documentation search can be a bit finicky though, for example 2to3 documentation tends to be the first result if there's a 2to3 fixer for what you search for.
Okay, yeah, no. I mean i kinda agreed with you here, but you just whipped out your dick as if it was to impress anyone without realizing not only does no one care, but you somehow have shit stains in the front of your underwear. Metaphorically speaking, of course.
I hate web stuff. I used to loathe web developers. But I recently started using Django (Python's web framework) and I've fallen in love with it because it's web development without feeling like I'm making web sites. It has a very heavy 'back-end' feeling. Python can be anything you want it to be. Video games, predictive analysis, data modeling, robotics and of course web development. What are some things you are looking to do? 
Ah ok that makes sense. So I just have to have the list be as big as what the biggest prime being tasted might be. Thanks.
I tried SymPy and you can't import it unfortunately.
Trying to find a book that covers less about Python syntax and a bit more about the theory, good practices, etc around Python. Why, between two methods, would one method be considered better than the other (in some or all circumstances). Something along those lines. Proficient in bash, but just getting into Python in the past six months, so I’m thinking it might not be a bad time to look at things like this. Open to suggestions.
Ooooooooooohhhhhhhhhh
&gt; They both do the same thing though, why would one be preferred over the other? `def` provides better tracebacks and string representations. See [Pep 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#programming-recommendations) (search for 'lambda'). &gt; Also good luck using `def`s in `sort`, `map` and such. That's why /u/EJOtter said 'named' functions. For anonymous functions, use the lambda. 
Backwards compatibility, probably.
MariaDB seems a bit mainstream to not be in the DB list.
I'm confused...
Have you heard of python 3
&gt; In one wave of the hand you justified your position by rejecting significant features of value to many others. This is getting tiresome. I didn't reject the value of reversions, I explained that the diff-based approach is *good* for reversions, while alembic often makes reversions too annoying to bother with. &gt; Which in turn requires a merging of the schema. Thusly the value of Alembic. I have no idea what you mean. I merge migration scripts all the time, and alembic is not required for this. They merge the same as any other file. You seem to be one of these people who has got used to a shitty process, and resists a better one of an inherent fear of change rather than any practical objection. &gt; But it does mean you preaching that everyone is doing it wrong is, frankly, invalid. If you think testability, automation, and simplicity are bad, then sure, keep doing it your way. I'll keep on automatically syncing my dev database, deploying well tested schema changes, and never thinking about schema version numbers again. Good luck!
They already show the use of numba's jit in the article.
Good point. Don't get me wrong I use `def`s primarily too, but I find the flexibility of `lambda`s very versatile too, that's why I was surprised there's a consensus the prefer one over the other.
Good point on the traceback, didn't think of that.

Use that as the first argument when you write the .cmd file and the path to your script as the second.

Ability to search stack overflow should be tested imho. Jokes apart, how you research informations about what you don't know and how fast you learn should be considered as great part of the interview
Sounds a bit like coderpad.io. 
This block here: for i in range (len(Movie)): if Movie[i] == "A" or Movie[i] == "E" or Movie[i] =="I" or Movie[i] == "O" or Movie[i] == "U": output.append("*") Words.append(Movie[i]) elif Movie[i].isspace(): output.append("/") Words.append(Movie[i]) else: output.append(" _ ") Words.append(Movie[i]) You repeat Words.appean(Movie[i]) 3 times. You can just include outside of the if else statements. Also instead of the block of code here: for i in range (len(Words)): if guess == Words[i]: #poping the index for the guess_words one output.pop(i) #appending the letter output.insert(i,Words[i]) Instead of iterating over an array and checking each index against the value you can use the [.index()](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/list/index) function to find the index of a string in a list. Also, I would put this into a function just so it can be called later, and maybe add arguments for number of lives also.

I am on my phone so it is a little hard to answer. Over all items: 1). Read about pep-8 and adhere to it. Pep-8 describes the syntax of the code. Spaces, capitalization, etc. It is confusing to other python programmers if you don’t stick to this standard. 2) Since you are practicing make good code you should break your code into logical functions where possible. For example make a function called get_user_input() and put the related code into that function. 3) I know this is overkill but it is good practice to write a unittest for your new functions. I am only saying this because you should get used to it. It will be required for any real development. 4) write your unittest first and then write your code. Specific to code: 1). Never do this: for i in range( len(movie)): m = movie[i] Instead do: for m in movies: Or (rare case) for i, m in enumerate(movies): I have some more suggestions that I will write when I get home.
You sometimes mix uppercase letters to your variable names, and sometimes you don't. And you sometimes separate variables and operators with whitespace, when other times you don't. This is inconsistent; I'd recommend reading PEP 8. You're also using for-loops that take the form `for x in range(len(y))`. Why not simply do `for x in y`? Oh, and string formatting is something you should learn. Instead of pet = "cat" print("My", pet, "is very cute") this is often preferable: print(f"My {pet} is very cute")
SPeaking from years of experience as a recruiter, now programmer, many times the issue isn't bad interview technique. It's not like if they only knew they'd change ways. It's an ego thing. Egos play a huge role in the tech workplace, and they are basically all you see in the interview. They want to find reasons to say no, no the other way around. Excellent work, though. Very impressive.

How do you create a function? A video link would be quite helpful. &amp;#x200B;
it is relevant as showing up in search results very close to the top, but I definitely never go there explicitly anymore whenever I'm looking for an answer to a programming related question
Hm, I am pretty sure I saw somewhere a way to directly (without recursion) convert index into coordinates x, y, but I can't find it right now, so I guess I'll write it later. Nice usage of Hilbert curves btw. 
I will read PEP 8. Thank you &amp;#x200B;
For most purposes, you define functions using the `def`-keyword: def my_function(number, another_number): return number + another_number Here, `my_function` is the name of the function, and `number` and `another_number` are positional arguments. `return` returns the value that follows it, like so: print(my_function(13, 37)) # prints 50, because 13 + 37 == 50 and my_function returns 50 You may sometimes run into lambda functions, which basically work the same way but can only consist of one line. But only use them if you **really** need them. my_other_function = lambda number, other_number: number + other_number That's basically equivalent to `my_function` in terms of input and output.
Newcomers to computer science shouldn't look at stackoverflow. It's not meant to learn the basics. I find it still very relevant and I'm glad it isn't filled with copies of the same questions about basic stuff
I absolutely hate landing at a top result for my question and it happens to be stack overflow, then I click it and the top answer is "this has been answered a thousand times, why don't you Google it before asking such a simple question" -.-
pretty cool way to generate abstract wallpapers
Damn, I do not have on GitHub. :/ I have lost it when I was changing my job. It was written in Python and Selenium. Simple class with few selectors and methods. Really simple piece of code. For sure you are able to write it. One problem that I had was with the password to Jira. How to store it or how to pass it. From command line as argument I was passing the password to Jira. I used sys library (I think). Selenium was finding the elements, inputs, fill them. In Python I wrote template for description field (steps, etc.) I am sure it can be improved more than my code. But, It was a pleasure to write. Damn, I have to write it again for my actual job :)
So lets say I want to create a function to get an input from a user def get_user_input(x): x=x.strip() # for a cleaner string return x #later somewhere in the string get_user_input() is this the correct way?
Be carefully if you want to do that you must compare with the fov\_distance², because you are moving the sqrt to the other side of the inequality. As the fov\_distance will not change you can precompute the square and compare: (Ax - Bx)² - (Ay - By)² &gt;= squared\_fov\_distance &amp;#x200B;
Your code looks nice and modular. Have you considered adding async support as well?
If you want to get input from the user, you'd usually use the built-in `input` function that reads from stdin. Function arguments, like `x` in your function, are only visible to the programmer.
Suppose you have an array that is of size [X][Y] and any given coordinate is (x,y) starting at (1,1). To "unravel" it such that the order is preserved left-to-right, your 1D index would be i = x + (X-1)*y. 
Mate, you're just embarrassing yourself now. Dynamic typing isn't about not having type declarations: you can write Haskell without type declarations but that doesn't make it dynamically typed (it's statically typed but capable of type inference thanks to our friends Roger Hindley and Robin Milner, both of whom I've met btw - Hindley was famous among the undergrads at Swansea as "that maths lecturer who always lectures in white gloves", because he had a reaction to chalk dust - but I digress). Dynamic typing is a well-defined term which is to do with having names whose types can modify over the lifetime of a program. Now, in parts of the type-theory community this is a controversial idea (Bob Harper in particular has argued that what we're really dealing with there is programs where every value has _the same_ type), but in terms of current programming language design, it's pretty well established and python is one of its primary exemplars. When you dismiss it as "promotional content" you are doing the language designers a disservice, and your statement about "whatever OP could possibly mean" is mystifying to me in its arbitrariness - OP mentioned it once, as part of a somewhat word-salady paean to python, but I see no reason to believe he meant it to mean anything other than what it does (it really does, sorry, I know you don't like the term for some reason but it really does have a meaning). Thanks for explaining the is-a relationship to the guy who mentioned the dynamically-typed lambda calculus. I'd obviously never heard of it and now I am enlightened. /s &lt;- in case it's not obvious. &gt; Standard defines what things are part of the language. No, "language definition" defines what things are part of the language. The clue is in the words "language" and "definition".
I have something similar, albeit more simplified. It's merely a bash script with a menu and interfacing with some .tex files used to generate invoices and estimates. It also generates a history file which can be used to pre-fill client names and regularly-appearing line items. The majority of the information is already baked in to the .tex files, so there is no need to input it at runtime. The script is used merely to assign the client name, account name, and the quantities and rates, which are obviously the most variable part. It seems like your implementation has quite a lot of overhead for what is (in theory) a simple task. Most of the heavy lifting is done by LaTeX, which supports variables and substitution and if statements.
Thanks for a detail reply :)) have a nice day !
OP here. &amp;#x200B; You tried to access to an interview as a candidate but you were authenticated as an interviewer. Do that again, but open the interview-link in a tab in incognito. That'll work.
&gt; A *master* and an apprentice Please refrain from using offensive terminology
:-) &amp;#x200B; Looks like a bug when indeed it's not. We should definitely render a different display error.
Goddamn, @ was just a first example I have thought of, turns out it stands for matrix multiplication, TIL, and you really went ahead and did it, actually setting the parameter as an instance variable ([self.name](https://self.name)) and using an overridden binary operator after that is something I never thought of, very creative Forbiddenfruit part is also very interesting, but I think the people I code with would hate me :D Thought it looks awesome. Thanks! 
I think I saw this in a PPCG question. 
The white board is your outline, it is not your code. If you have to wonder if your code is well written, it probably isn't. Rule of thumb. Well written code should be appropriately documented, do the job, be reusable, (relatively)easy to understand, and most important, maintainable. Pretty much anything that might be quality appropriate for a package or module.
As someone who loves coding and is an artist, this blows me away 
Nice
One-based arrays are what they teach you in school, boy? We ain't no FORTRAN lovers, you hear me? Gitcher MATLAB out of this house, and find a home in BASICtown.
First I thought there were only 32*32 pixels in the image. That way the path between colors doesn't look very continous. With the full resolution it is much more complete.

Oh, I see. Don't know what I was thinking. Tired brain is tired. 
TBH I can't remember a single time when this happened to me, I'd just scroll down to the next answer. In this regard the SO community is adequate and will rather bash such an answer. A bigger problem is when questions just get brigated by high karma dudes and closed for "not being on topic".
Hey you. I like this. 
The best solution is to use other IDE
Thank you :)
You're welcome baby! 
Yes, however your claims of a bad product, as I mentioned, were mostly double edged swords and "it's Py2 hurr durr". Those double edged swords aren't a problem for many people, and all the "it's Py2" problems are proven solved.
As a Scientific programmer / Engineer I always have problems choosing my main role in surveys like this. I mainly work with data generation (simulations), not data analysis. Machine learning even got their own category... Oh, well 😐
Thank you – appreciated.
I have been working on automating this task for a month now. Pfsense firewall has no cli for firewall rule changes in the format I need. And no API.
Spotipy does if you have a premium spotify account, as you need to get oauth2 validation for spotipy to play full songs. Look here for how to do that: https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#authorized-requests
Yeah that's understandable. Last year we asked only 2 questions What activities are you involved in? and What is your primary activity. Now we ask some more questions to refine the results and take into account various cases. When you select several options to the first quest... Let's say Data Analysis, Machine Learning and something else... As the next step we ask you to estimate your involvement in these activities primary/secondary/hobby and we additionally ask if you consider yourself as data scientist. Having this combination of answers we'll be able to build a better understanding of what respondent uses Python for. I think data simulations could be a separate option for a multi-answer question, or we could introduce "Scientific use" option and then ask specifically what it's about like "data analysis, machine learning, simulations, etc." 
Thanks we'll take it into account. I hope you've put it under "other"
It is off-topic, but what would you think of a candidate that showed little or no ego? 
I've been interviewing heavily lately, and I have to back this up. In particular, I've had two interviews that were very similar in terms of subject matter, the offer and the role, and I think my answers at company B were possibly slightly better than at A. Despite that, from the get-go I got the sense that the interviewers at B were looking for a gotcha, for a reason to reject me, and backfilled the reasons why afterwards - sure enough, I got a rejection. In A, it felt more like they wanted me around, but wanted to feel out if I had what it takes to pull my weight in the team, far less adversarial. And in the end, even though I may have answered less smoothly, I did get the offer.
[Here is a link](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/22144/images-with-all-colors)
IDLE is not really intended for production use. It doesn't have features like recovery. Your code is gone. IDLE is a neat toy, but if you're working on a serious project, I implore you to switch to a different code editing tool.
I still find most of my relevant answers in SO.
selenium is one way to go. You could also use Burp as a proxy and watch each step as you manually fill out the forms. That will show you the data that's actually being passed back and forth. Then you can use Python with requests (or similar) to make those same get/post requests. Once you have that, you should have a stable and fast solution. It takes a while to get it right but once you've mapped the api you'll understand your code and you can trust it. At least that's been my experience doing pretty much the same task.
That might work. Thank you.
Jesus dude...may I ask why they are so reluctant to upgrade to Python 3? And FWIW I've seen scripts on github that will convert Python 2 to Python 3.
thanks! I will check it out
Python 3 has them....? 🤔 
I don't know man. They have been in the industry for almost 15 years now and they still don't see the benefits of having a up to date structure. "It's too costly and to dangerous" they say. But I know the real problem. They never documented their product and now there's a lot of features, mechanism and business logic in the code that they don't know anymore how it should work. So they're afraid to change something in case it breaks something that they don't remember how it works. It's honestly a very good job experience (I'm in my second year on the professional market) because I work hard to transform this cancer in good and readable code, but I'm out of here before 2020! Haha
No, Python 3 has a print function. If you run `print 73` in py3 it's going to syntax error, whereas that works in py2.
I am working on a new design for my #AntminerMonitor
I suppose just to throw in my 2 cents on the subject, I prefer \`def\`s to \`lambda\`s. A while back I had a project where I had \`lambda\`s scattered throughout as common as waffle houses in the south. Turns out this causes a memory leak fairly quickly lol. Had to get the help of an expert online to help me solve it. The resulting code worked, but was so drastically different from what I'd written that I had little to no clue how the different parts actually interacted with each other, though this was mainly due to me not understanding objects and why you would split a single file into multiple files at the time. At this point I avoid \`lambda\`s like the plague haha
Yep, was afraid that would be the case. Luckily its easily rewritable!

Perhaps I don't understand Pythonicity, because I disagree. In fact, I think there should be more keywords, like assert.
HIRE THEM. HIRE THEM THAT SECOND. I'm only half joking. But a solid dev who is humble, slow to speak, admits mistakes, and is aware of shortcomings. You hire that person right there and then. Most don't know. They look for the "gotcha." I'm convinced a good portion of the "hiring" that goes on is just an act to get out of work. These people obviously don't **need** anyone. They one's that do make the hire. Most of the time it's "eh, we could or we couldn't." So they wait till they interview 20 people over several months, then finally make a decision - and many times not. A peculiar world out there. My advice: go FREELANCE/Consulting.
I agree, that seems more readable
It's still early.
Cool
My parents told me what you told him and i started working first as mover at 16, then as an Electrician. The pay you talk about is nonsense, no one would hire you at that hour rate lol. If you browse python subs at 17 you should be in college and doing what you like best.
These are great tips! I am not a windows user so I forget about some of these things. I'll do what I can after work to get this fixed and re-release with your recommendations. If you want to open an issue on the github even better, but either way I'll get to it :P Thanks!
You were working the wrong jobs, or being screwed by your boss. Again, if you own the business, you set your own pay. People still have to be willing to pay for it, but within those confines, you can make a lot of money.
Ahhh, I see what you mean now. I'll have to tinker with that concept to see if I can get it working. I did some code profiling and `sqrt` doesn't seem to be causing any slowdowns, however I'll take what I can get wherever I can get it! Thanks for the help :D
I read it as: "I'm worried college will sink me into debt for the next decade." I just wanted to let someone know there are other options.
Thank you :D
Can you elaborate on this? The advantages that the wiki page on cooperative multitasking lays out are ease of implementation and performance. That said, I think I understand your point.
Thanks for the tip!
This point confuses me. It's impossible not to wait for results from db or network if you want to do any work with that data. 
Don't want to be mean, but you are unlikely to get a clear response if you phrase your question like this. It's still very much unclear what you are trying to accomplish and what your initial layout looks like. Do you get emails from Amazon and want to auto-forward those to the team? Auto print? Etc. Also, if you are just beginning with programming, first get into the basics, maybe head over to /r/learnpython Pretty sure everyone here loves to help, but first you need to get some groundwork done :)
Really? You don't care what order the operations happen in?

Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. I highly recommend posting your question there. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using. *** ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)
So... EVERYTHING is used to get either an asterisk (chr(EVERYTHING) == '*') or a space (chr(EVERYTHING - 10) == ' '). ARIADNE contains bits that define the printing options: - bits 0-3 (the mask 'r &amp; 15') define the number of a char repetitions. - bit 4 (the mask 'r &amp; 16') defines if it is '*' or ' '. - bit 5 (the mask 'r &amp; 32') indicates that the character ends the line. Only the left part of a line is generated this way. The right one is added symmetrically in reversed order. Is it correct?
That’s dope
I considered trades (and a bunch of other careers) for a long time and worked some stupid manual jobs, until it became apparent that I just organically new so much about computers that it started to become obvious it would be stupid *not* to get into that field.20 or so years later here I am. Never finished a degree and know even more trade skills now than I did before, but none will never beat the money of working in tech. I will say though, the most important thing is the ability to learn. With trades that helps for sure but you often still need hours and hours of practice to nail down the manual skills. With computers you can read about something new and be using it to solve your problems the same day.
For what it's worth, this is brilliant in theory. I've always wondered why any tech company would ask you to code on a whiteboard when they could hand you a sandboxed laptop and see what you can do in a more comfortable environment where the results could actually be tested. I guess though a lot of it is just mind games and trying to trip you up. Making people use skills they have in a way they aren't prepared for or something. And to be fair, it's valid for an interviewer to want to find out how someone acts in stressful or unfamiliar scenarios, but I think it's become so common that employers don't always weigh that people are never going to actually show their full potential in such a situation.
Don't see any error. According to the output you provided, "requests" is already installed for current Python version. Also there is a warning from pip about the cache directory access, but it just means that it can’t use cache and rather every time download the packages. It recommends using 'sudo -H' to let it use cache. Also, a couple of recommendations: 1. Looks like you’re using Anaconda, so it's better to use `conda install` instead of `pip install`. Chances are it works without "sudo". 2. You could use `pip install --user requests` without "sudo". 3. Rule of thumb: create a virtual environment for any new project. Install packages globally only if you're going to use them independently (like "pip", "invoke", "thefuck" and so on)
Thanks a lot! I will give it a try on virtual environment. Thanks!
While I admit the concept is clearly not original (as evidenced by the mentioned link as well as the [PPCG question](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/22144/images-with-all-colors) I would like to say I came to the same conclusion mostly independently; I was contemplating how to traverse colour space without overlapping for a completely unrelated application and the idea to use space filling curves struck me (also undoubtedly inspired by the [3b1b video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s7h2MHQtxc) on them).
what's that? 
Really really cool. 
Consider using string.ascii_lowercase and string.ascii_uppercase, etc for all your character lists. Import string library to access these.
You can iterate through strings like you can a list. I did want to suggest that, but didn't want to over whelm you :3

[https://github.com/GhostofGoes/get-mac](https://github.com/GhostofGoes/get-mac) Cross-platform tool to get MAC addresses of system interfaces and remote hosts on a LAN. Works on Windows, Linux, and Mac with Python 2.6+ and 3.4+, as well as WSL as of a week ago, and several alternative interpreters. It uses a combination of parsing (regex or string processing) the output of system commands (e.g. ipconfig, arp), built-in modules, and third-party packages. The current state of operating systems is incredibly diverse (just look at a Linux distro family tree!), which makes selecting a particular method to use complicated. My approach to deal with this has been to try all the methods known for that general platform and type of information, in order of likelihood of success. This week has been mostly Hacktoberfest. Tagging issues with Hacktoberfest has actually been really successful! I've merged 4 PRs already that added something substantive to the project. I'm working on adding some more issues today and over the weekend, with at least a few more beginner-friendly ones.
Thanks ofedorov! I have solved the problem! It is caused by 2 versions of python installed on my Mac. I deleted the older version (2.7) (and the python 2.7 folder in the anadora2 folder) then I reinstalled the requests module again. This time, I made sure that it is installed into the python 3 folder. Then everything becomes fine! 
What's the processing time?
Of course I would recommend having a look at [the library I wrote](https://github.com/ariebovenberg/snug) for this purpose ;) Probably best to check out several other toolkits like [uplink](https://github.com/prkumar/uplink) or [tapioca](https://github.com/vintasoftware/tapioca-wrapper). You should be able to find a pattern you like, if only as an example.
I haven't automated these (yet!) but downloading new podcast episodes, newly released songs on YouTube or anything similar. Simple. 
Everything listed so far is awesome! I'm Working on a project for school on financial trends in the film industry and for my own projects I'm working on a raspberry pi that makes music based on the orientation of poi.
My light goes on automatically. Both as a soft wake-up light when I need to wake up, as well as when I get home. This saves me literally seconds a day! I'm using home-assistant (hass.io) which is python.

Love it. Very useful. :)

Don't beat yourself up, learning CS for the first time is a nightmare, especially if you grew up tech-illiterate like me. I went through my first month of Java classes in high school just turning in blank quizzes because I couldn't figure out data types. That teacher was a saint for being patient with me. &amp;#x200B; To address the questions in the post, a loop is a section of code that repeats itself over and over until something happens, that something is defined when you set up the loop. A string is just text, as opposed to numbers. You can call letters and numbers both "text", but the computer needs to think of them separately. It sees numbers as things to do math on and "text" as something to treat like words. (It's more complicated than that, but this is a simple intro.) &amp;#x200B; "Hello World" is a string. So is the entire content of my post. Numbers and letters can both be strings, it's just a matter of how the computer knows how to treat the information. This is less clear in python because python is a "dynamically typed language". That means that the language can mostly figure out what's a word and what's a number. &amp;#x200B; In any case, don't get discouraged! I was in the same boat you were in, and now I program for my job. You'll get through this eventually.

My "always on" Python code at home is monitoring the water level in my sump pump pit. A tape sensor converts water level into voltage, which an A/D provides to a Raspberry Pi via serial port, where a Python script reads, logs, and heavily filters the very noisy input to detect the "edges" (decreases in water level) indicating that my sump pump is running. I've got it setup to provide web-accessible view of the recent history of pump activity, as well as text messaging alerts to my phone if it detects various failure modes (sharp increase in pump frequency if the drain gets clogged and water is "cycling", sharp *decrease* in pump frequency suggesting that the pump might have failed, etc.).

4 years ago I could not program anything at all. I went on project euler and went to the first problem and just stared at it for like 10 hours trying to think how to solve it. I kept at it though, and now I have solved over 40 problems on project euler, and have built a lot of different programs and websites. If you are persistent and keep with it, you will get better. There is a hump for beginners in programming which is hard to get over, but once you get over your progression is a lot more linear and you can see your results. If you are really struggling with python, I reccomennd learn python the hard way, I have recommended before on here, but I will recommend it again. It is really good. Beyond that I recommend reading a lot of peoples code, and going on sites like [project euler](projecteuler.net) and trying to solve their coding problems. Start with the easiest ones, and don't have an ego about it. If it takes you 100 hours, it takes you 100 hours and you will become a better programmer because of it. The most important part is that you don't compare your success to other people. There are people who will be able to learn how to program good code in a few months, some people take years. Move at your own pace, but work hard. It may sound cliche, but you just have to belief in yourself and stick too it. I know, because 4 years ago I was in the exact same scenario and I was ready to call it quits, but I kept going and I am eternally grateful because of it. Just keep doing what you are doing. Keep pushing yourself, and you will get it.

Feedback! of the opinionated variety. You probably want to be aware of anki if you aren't already that does a similar thing. As well as the word spaced repetition. I'm not a fan of spaced repetition, but I think this is a personal matter. The thing about anki is that you need to actually open it and go through a set of tasks, having something that interrupts you have some benefit here, because it means you don't have to do everything in one go. I personal find *a lot* of context when learning something stops me from getting bored and depressed. Which space repetition can me to do this I like to find how a word is related to other words, in terms of spelling of usage, or related words. Here word lists can be pretty useful. In practice you might find the random interruptions problematic. Again this comes down to personality, I try to avoid this by letting me delay reminders like this. Though then you can into a habit of repeatedly delaying actions. An alternative to this is "batching" up tasks, which is kind of what you do. When I have done similar things I've made lots of use the "leo" website and a command line tool to scrape it. ---- I feel like there is a tension between "batching to avoid interruptions" and "spreading out to avoid work". Like I have a reminder app that tells me about things to do, and one of the actions I implied in was something called "fan" that takes all the queued reminders and spreads them out over a period of time. There is also this tension between meaning and order when learning. It's like... if you make everything neat and ordered it can be very orderly and efficient and you can have a plan and make progress, but I just get so bored. Whereas meaning and structure and learning things together is really fun, but kind of difficult to plan or order. Well I mean you can just read for half an hour a day for example and play with a dictionary I suppose. Anyway that's a lot of muttering. I hope it's useful. ------ Regarding the code itself. * You might like to be aware of mac users if you are interested in people using this app * If you want people to use this app you will probably need to distinguish your app from anki. I think the fact that it interrupts you does make things different * I would personally like to have a plain text / json versus of the data because it is easier to edit. When I've written similar tools I have implemented a mini language for storing vocabulary. * If you want a bunch of people to use this you might like to setuptools and put this on pypi. * People will judge you for defining process in the middle of code, they will say that it makes the code unordered and difficult to read * People will judge you for not being pep8 compliant (formatting standards) the big point here is "=" versus " = " * See datetime.date().year/month/day * In add_item I would would sample_sentences = [] inside the while loop. I think just because there is "less state" in doing this. Hope that's not too much feedback! I'm brain dumping a bit. 
Neither - Telegram is a fantastic WhatsApp-like instant messaging service which provides the most amazing API ever. I really cannot recommend it enough, you can even deliver custom keyboards to the chat window, and so emulate a rudimentary UI for your bot (in my case, camera settings and buttons for video and night capture mode). There are several projects which provide python bindings for the API, I personally used [telepot](https://github.com/nickoala/telepot) but I have heard good things about [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) too. 
Meh, just getting information from wikipedia. They don't actually block scripts, so I can just use requests and search from the search box. 
Every Sunday morning a grocery list is generated based on a generated meal plan for the week. My girlfriend or I can add a specific meal to the upcoming week if we want, otherwise it pulls from a list of previous ones we like. I would like to have it order the food necessary too where it asks me to check and ensure i have sufficient amounts of some stuff then orders what I need but none of the grocery delivery services have an API.

The remote filename is predictable with the date as part of the name........as my code is currently (to get every one available) and because I am too lazy to change it.........it generates a list of remote files and then does a requests.get and writes the content to a file of the same name. I don't get ones I already have. About 30 lines of code
I want this. Got a github? Groceries/meal planning/etc is the bane of my existence
This sounds awesome! Do you have to add things manually, or can you set messages remotely (like say, via text msg)?
I'm surprised your firewall doesn't do that automatically. Or do you mean you're scraping stuff like US-CERT bad actor lists and blocking them?
I made a flask app and a crappy bootstrap js app to be able to switch between audio devices on my computer and control the volume. I put it on an old ipod touch and mounted it by my computer. That way I can switch between headphones, desk speakers, and my oculus without having to exit the game I'm playing or right click on the stupid little sound icon in windows
My firewall is blocking everything fine, but I have some open ports for services I run. Security Onion network IDS with full packet capture throws alerts in elastic search when it detects ssh brute force attempts or sql injections and such. I am secure enough in general but I wanted to entirely drop everything coming from those IPs. I wrote a script that queries elastic search and returns those then adds them to my blacklist. 
There are so many automation tools and programs I can't think of anything I have to automate by writing code. Besides, automation is pretty dull and I have more interesting things to spend my time coding just at work alone.

But who else has an API?
Lol man I've been barking up that tree for years. She just cries and asks why one thread isn't enough for me :-/
I assigned all the phones, including my teenage daughter's friends, static IP's. I have code that pings through each of them once a minute and log it to mysql. I can then go to a web page for my house and it shows me who is home and the last time they were there. It is most handy to know if one of my daughter's friends and an impromptu sleep over. (Happens often) &amp;#x200B; Also have a Python Rest API for my house, has a few things including an endpoint that smartthings pushes all events to and then logged to mysql.

i haven't run into this particular problem, but as much as i love pipenv, i will admit that i have occasionally run into somewhat abstruse bugs and edge cases that nobody else seems to hit. one alternative you may find appropriate is poetry. i haven't used it quite as much but it does seem to have a lot of the same features (in spirit if not in practical use).

Yo Spotify marketing guy - hire me.
ive got lights, blinds, thermostat, and plant watering all running on python, then i use hap-nodejs to get it in ios homekit. im working on a tornado web server for data vizualization. so far it just displays temperature in a few different spots, and how long its been since i watered the plant.
I do something similar, though instead of pinging each device, I just scrape the data off of my routers status page. Means I don't need a list of IPs, and the router already has hostnames to identify as well as uptime stats to know how long the devices have been connected. 
This sounds awesome. I want in

Pygame doesn’t come with many functions aside from just showing an image, so you have to do almost everything yourself. Also, Pygame doesn’t use hardware acceleration with a lot of GPUs, so rendering is pretty slow.

that's not a python specific problem. You're just not understanding programming terms, something you would have encountered regardless of the language. a string is just a bunch of alphabetical / alphanumeric sentence. doesn't have to be a sentence you understand, it could be a bunch of random things of any length... "asdnijcd82je3nr" is a string a loop is a sequence of code / program statements that repeats itself until something happens. You have 3 types of loops (from an intro to programming point of view): while; do while; for... \&gt; While loops you can describe them as "do the following as long as the condition remains true". Think of it like this: a kid can continue to play minecraft as long as his/her parents continue to not tell them to stop. Once they say "Stop" or "You can't play anymore", then the kid stops playing minecraft. \&gt; Do While: noone really uses this thing, but for some reason it's still taught. I'm sure there's a reason for it and it is used somewhere, but I've personally never encountered it. It goes like this: Do this sequence of code, then check if you need to repeat it or not... Think of it like this: take out the trash and take only one bag, then check if there's more trash to take out and keep doing this until no more garbage bags to take out \&gt; for loops: this is used very heavily everywhere. For python, the common way of using this is a foreach loop. For loops are structured like this in other languages: for (start point, condition to exit, iterator). a common way people describe this type of loop is to say "you have the loop repeat itself 10 times" and I personally don't think thats a good way to explain it. It's still like the other types of loops i explained. Repeat until a condition tells you to no longer repeat. anything that you can do in a for loop, can be done in a while loop. &amp;#x200B; if you want me to explain more, let me know.
You know those banners where the letters are strung together? That's a good mnemonic for strings. [https://i.imgur.com/gonDVYT.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/gonDVYT.jpg)
Fake girlfriend Telegram bot that automatically asks how my day is going at random from 9am to 4pm (Maximum of three times). It also has a random selection of after-work activities and after-work plans that she asks if I want to do, what we want to have for dinner etc. It's a pretty good help with my depression.
My apartment's dryer does not have a buzzer to indicate when its done... To avoid the clothes wrinkling, I bought a USB microphone for my raspberry pi and set it up to monitor when the dryer stops running. When it does, it sends me a notification via Pushover to my phone. That way I can go unload it right away when it is done, and avoid some ironing.
I wrote a script to take a directory of music, some times and text, and it knits it all together to make a workout routine. As in, I make a list of times and intervals, like (500, 'Run for 500 seconds'), and at 500 seconds in my music a computer voice will say "Run for 500 seconds"

Here's the idea of the future improvement - some messaging bot. You can run, for example, telegram not from the same raspberry and send messages directly to it. This way, you won't need vpn connection or browser, so you can set messages more easily.

I mean so many things. But one of the easiest (and my wife’s favorite) was our windows and shades. Developed a custom home control system and it interfaces with pretty much everything. Can control my doors and locks, indoor/outdoor lights (I cheated here on the indoor lights and used hue lights everywhere, but there is a python library to talk to the bridge), windows, hot tub control &amp; maintenance, sprinkler system 6 zones + garden, indoor and outdoor stereo control, video surveillance and security system (I also use a third party for simple security monitoring), and a number of other systems. But for the windows and blinds I used Nema 23 steppers, I ended up with a ton of extras from some other projects I didn’t finish. Nema 17’s would have most likely been more than fine. If you need any help working through ideas or code let me know. 
Are you using it for the AC/ heat system as well? 
Does amazon fresh serve your area? If so it’s very simple to automate any orders through amazon, or in your case amazon fresh. You also don’t need an API to automate this, but clearly it would help. At the worst case you could use selenium and have everything added to your cart, and then manually adjust cart or checkout to eliminate concerns. 
Pretty cool!!

I think you’re a bit out of your wheelhouse doing this. But I’ll give you some guidance where things are breaking. You need to make sure you install virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper. You’re tell bash (in .bashrc) to startup the virtualenvwrapper and it’s giving you an error. So, either ensure virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper are installed and setup properly. Or don’t use a virtual env if this is the soul purpose of the machine (still better to use it) Also in your .bashrc source usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh Should be on one line, no ‘ at the end. 
Come visit us on /r/homeassistant. It's a full home automation suite that's pretty much the best out there (open source or proprietary). It's all built on Python. You can add your own compenents and even write automations in Python (using Appdaemon).

Choose something you like and are curious about, this will likely make you excel in whatever path you choose. It seems you are very proactive to run after yours goals, so keep it up Whenever a person search me for advices to get in data science field, I say they have to be curious to understand and solve a problem, Also, my work is related to digital marketing so I always says to not see the data as numbers or strings alone, because it was probably generated by a person/client interacting with your technology. So how you plan on using this data is how you are treating your client

I do something similar. Instead of static IPs I have DHCP reservations based on MAC address. When your device DHCPs you always the the same IP. This way you don't have to mess with static/DHCP settings. Long ago I moved from a 'regular' router to pfSense. pfSense has tons of monitoring tools to do some of what you're doing... I like bandwidthd. I think Homeassistant can do some of this device tracking as well. I don't run it often, but I did write some python to read the log files from my pi-hole. Running a proxy server in the age of https everywhere doesn't tell you much. I create a csv with requesting ip and trimmed domain. I used to load that into Tableau for heatmaps, but I may rewrite that in Pandas... too many projects!
It's a WIP but I've got a script that captures a few seconds of webcam video, timestamps, and converts to mp4. When parts arrive from ebay I'll have a reed switch on my doors that trigger record() and maybe a PIR sensor that tells it when to stop recording. Right now it points at the dog's bowl and I start it from cron several times an hour while I'm at work.

I know not directly answering your question but I have been using NGINX and uWSGI. uWSGI is just an implementation of WSGI. you wouldn’t run python manage.py runs ever in production (staging or similar) environment. This is where your uWSGI conf/ini or wsgi.py configuration comes into play. I don’t know if I am helping or if I fully understand your question. But basically apaches mod_wsgi would talk to open a socket to wsgi which would in turn talk to Django. You wouldn’t also run manage.py runserver. I suggest reading this or something like it, and take it slow if you have to, so you can really understanding what is actually going on. https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/howto/deployment/wsgi/modwsgi/ 
Why not just manage the firewall directly from Python? Firewalld has an excellent Python interface (3 &amp; 2 compatabile). 
No, you really did answer a lot of my doubts!

Very light-weight programs who need only Table display. I made first versions of this library in 2015 just for fun and to practice my (in that moment) recently adquired Python skills.
This is awesome! If you are using selenium, this means you have to have your computer open for this to work. Do you have a work around for when you are offline?

Logs of my router are being forwarded to a Splunk Instance. From there when it notices that my Phone hasn't reconnected yet it sends an alert to a python Script turn off all my WeMo connected devices (which are all lamps). When I get home a log is made and it issues a command to turn everything back on. 
You can also use a power monitor (wall plug) to check for power usage instead. 
Thank you. It took me a day :)
Experiment with different projects. You’ll find what you like and you can use what you learn to apply it to other languages. In regards to jobs, if your background is engineering and you already have a job, start thinking of ways to automate some of your work in python. Then talk to coworkers or your boss about getting out on a software team. Best of luck.

I imagine a lot of that comes out of Tor, you might be able to save yourself some time scraping Tor’s published exit nodes periodically and blocking them.
Amazon doesn't require CAPTCHA at login ?
No, but even if it did, doesn't really matter. So, using the selenium example, you can just copy your cookies from your normal browser, and use them in selenium (so it wont require you to log in). &amp;#x200B; I normally export my cookies manually into a json file. Then do something in python like this: ```python driver = webdriver.Chrome("./chromedriver") driver.get("https://google.com/") with open("creds.json","r") as file: cookies = json.loads(file.read()) for cookie in cookies: driver.add_cookie(cookie) driver.get("https://mail.google.com/mail/u/4/") ``` There is a python package to do this automatically: https://github.com/n8henrie/pycookiecheat ```python from pycookiecheat import chrome_cookies import requests url = 'http://example.com/fake.html' # Uses Chrome's default cookies filepath by default cookies = chrome_cookies(url) r = requests.get(url, cookies=cookies) ``` Also, for un-avoidable captcha, I've been using this for a looong time. lol http://deathbycaptcha.com 
I am not on any social media. But I have to make sure that I know about my girlfriend's Instagram post. So I have set up a script that downloads the images she has uploaded or when she changes her profile picture. And sends me the picture along along with the link via a Telegram bot.
Makes total sense! I can see where it would be beneficial. I am a fan of your line charts. :D 
Bahahaha!
My sister runs a small school and she asked me to place an ad on a site which is somewhat equivalent on Craigslist. Using selenium and cronjobs I automated this entire process... so everyday at about 5:34 an advert is placed. All I have to do is click on the confirmation link in mail at 5:34. Any idea how I can automate this 100%?
Okay glad I could help. lol Let me know if you need more assistance :)

You should talk to her about your trust issues and get then out of then way to build a foundation for a more long term relationship. Or not... being a bit creepy is cool too. 
I might add comments, clean up the codebase and fix the wonky package structure (it was my first usable project after all :D) and put it on github at some point - but basically, the bot parses messages sent to it via telegram, and responds accordingly (e.g. with a picture or a time lapse series taken with the PiCamera extension module for the Pi, or with the stdout of the passed on shell call if the command was not recognized). I also hardcoded a list of times downloaded from the web with sunrise times for my location, and each day it sends me a picture taken at sunrise.

Learn by example is the best way, start small and get comfortable with functions etc. Then start to create bigger programs. Find a small project you can follow along on the web and just copy it, but type the code don't just copy and paste. Maths isn't entirely necessary but the basic algebra can't hurt in terms of understanding manipulating data as you may want to access certain bits or set conditions on a length etc. 
You're going to run it problems if you install and use virtualenv into the system path (/usr/local) which trying to use Anaconda which is installed into /home/Jak. How did you install pip? How did you install virtualenv? If you comment out the "export PATH" line, you're no longer using the Anaconda python executable, but instead whatever one is installed in the system.
I mostly listen with apps, but if I want to grab a particular audio file and save it. Then some automation should be done. 
I was looking into making something like this a while back. You basically get some soil moisture sensors, feed that data into the pi, and if it needs watering then it can power a servo to open up a valve to allow water into a soaker hose for a given time. 
Why not host it on a public accessable webserver instead? Your stack looks perfect for a SaaS setup. Do you really want people to: install something, run it and then be able to view it in a webbrowser?

I wrote a script that takes a list of torrented tv show files. It then parses out the name of the show, the season number and episode number. It uses this to lookup up the properly formatted show name and episode name from The TVDB's API. It then renames the files to a standard format (Series Name - S00E00 - Episode Name.ext). It has saved me a lot of manual work, and has been relatively reliable.

Most topics in maths that you learn in middle school and higher will almost never be used in python. However, there are exceptions to this such as scientific computing with python. Python is a really great beginner language, perhaps the best. You don't need to learn another language before python. &amp;#x200B;
I wrote a script that takes link to my YouTube playlist of music videos, downloads them, converts them to mp3s and store it in my music folder. I have it scheduled to run on every boot. So if I like a video (liked videos also form a playlist) or added a video to a playlist today.. I'll most definitely have it downloaded for me to listen to.. tomorrow..
Most nights I watch an episode of a tv program from my bed before I sleep. I type in the running time of a tv program I'm watching and the python will shut down my pc when it finishes so I don't have to get out of bed.

It's doable. I have a similar set up and use it to book recreation rooms on my campus 28 days in advance from my raspberry pi 3.

A bot that checks email at a server for an email address with login credentials, and waits for a confirmation email and confirms it. Maybe even connected to the bot that creates the ad, so that it knows to only confirm emails that were a response to the created ad (for security, in case someone tries to phish your bot somehow).
Automation is boring? Automation is the reason I learned to write code, it is very exciting to me.
You're hired.
&gt; I figured I'd give Pipenv a shot despite a lot of negativity here. Well, you said it yourself. Do you like spending time solving problems created by other people while creating software which they allege is intended to solve your problems of the kind your are already solving? As someone who does mainly infrastructure-related stuff as a day job, I see no merit in using `pipenv`: it creates far more problems than it solves. Wherever it solves a problem it is not through its own effort, but through using other tools, and whenever it creates a problem, it's through its own code. Hence, my conclusion: it's not worth the time spent on it for projects I'm going to be paid for. But, if you are doing it as a hobby, and you just like picking apart horrid code written by others... `pipenv` might just be a great opportunity.
Oh, you married a hand-me-down barely working Roomba

I suppose the code is written in Python and the output in French, right? :D
I absolutely does not.
Probably, but it misses the point of the thread. How does someone utilize Python, not "how are you using this wrong".
Maths that will stand you in good stead for programming - in increasing level of difficulty. - arithmetic (order of operations) - Boolean / formal logic (and, or, not, for, etc) - discrete maths ( graph theory, set theory, game theory) - stats, linear algebra and multivariate calculus - this will enable you to understand and program machine learning and AI.

A program that hits the Google calendar API and spits out conflicts between my kids baseball games so i know if I need help getting them to and from the fields. Nothing spectacular but it helps me. Hosted on a Django site as well
Hmmm. I don't think so. I investigated several approaches to doing this, including the ultrasonic sensor mentioned by /u/broccoligold, as well as the "Tweet-a-Watt" approach of modifying an energy use monitor to detect pump operation by current draw instead of changing water level. I'm not very good at building electronics, and this approach seemed simpler (and thus, for me, safer). A more detailed description, and links to the source code and hardware used, is [here](https://possiblywrong.wordpress.com/2016/05/14/sump-pump-monitoring-with-a-raspberry-pi/).

Something is wrong with cock and potassium
I've made an element dictionary {symbol : element name} Then a convert(word) function tries to rewrite the word using keys from the dictionary, and returns a list of elements if possible
Would you care to share this?
Potassium's symbol is actually K, don't ask me why \^\^
I'm just going to go ahead and reject that PR.
Since you write potassium in Latin as Kalium (many parts of the world use that). 
I actually had it checking a PasteBin page at first but it was disconnecting so I used the web server. The issue wasn’t the pastebin code though. It was the firmware version. So maybe I’ll go back to that. It’s a project I play with when I get stuck on real stuff I’m building. I find it helpful to have several little projects I can tweak and improve so I can code every day.

Added to [the new Python OOP wiki](https://gitlab.com/metaperl/python-oop/wikis/home) ... the old place has [quite a few DI modules](https://github.com/metaperl/python-oop#dependency-injection). 
Best excuse to automate something. :D
That is cool. I hope that one day I may achieve that....:D Newbie here
Oh yeah! Mycroft is super easy to get started with and also to extend its feature (*skills* in Mycroft lingo). The one thing that might act as a caveat is the TTS (the speaking function). Currently, the Mycroft implementation is focussed on making it work on embedded, underpowered systems as well. So, their TTS is constrained. One of the most irritating things is that the TTS works on a 1:1 timing ratio. So, if the audio is going to be 5 secs long, then the audio generation would also be 5 secs. So, it can feel sluggish when speaking back to you. I have worked my way around it though. I have excellent internet connectivity in my home with MPF *et al* since I have a lab. I use google's TTS. The high bandwidth ensures that it is as responsive as Android Assistant. I come from an AI background with lots of experience in Watson and Tensorflow. So, I have interfaced a lot of YOLO9000, tensorflow models and a few of the AlchemyAPI stuff with Mycroft. One of the cool things that I do is, once the webcam picks up my face, it plays YT content via those puny ass speakers on those cheap tabs. But, here's the catch, the tab *nearest to me* will be playing the content as I keep moving around the house.
I guess that makes sense
You can check it on my github @vaebhav
&gt; esp8266 May I please ask if you could explain this to me?
disgusting yet beautiful 
Would you be willing to share. I am kinda looking for something like this, but I would like to use it on multiple websites.
https://product-details.mozilla.org/1.0/firefox_versions.json contains the latest version numbers of Firefox's various release channels
This sounds great 
inam trying to make a like button for my flask project but nothing i do is working and i onky have a week to get this done
Only the English and the French still call it Potassium.
It is a pfsense firewall.
Same for Spanish. Sodio y potasio 
I like this one. You're my kind of person.
Morning coffee maker, alarm, your lights, something to remind your lights are on, check to see if garage door is open, check to see if the front door is locked, heating pad for your bed, (it's about bed time, maybe warm the covers) there are a thousand things that could be automated, and make life easier. You can do it, too.
Writing automation is boring.(Unless it's challenging) Using automation is convenient. 
Yea i wish it was that easy. There is no cli for firewall rules with pfsense. So for now i got the automation script working. Supposedly in the next version of pfsense we will have a better cli. 
Same with the gold, which is Aurum. 
And Italian, sodio e potassio
&gt; Morning coffee maker I use an aeropress, and I don't want to build a robot. &gt; alarm A clock. I get up the same time every day, even on weekends. &gt; your lights What on Earth would I automate there? It's a goddamn switch. On the rare occasions I want light, I turn it on. I mostly use natural light in my house. &gt; check to see if garage door is open I just use a habit. &gt; check to see if the front door is locked It is, because I never fully unlock it. The door locks when I close it. My life is already pretty automated, it just didn't require much code. 
Oh ok, you are using the symbols It's Kalium in German so I'm not surprised :)
For work I use a Macbook Pro, which isn't going to be any help to you. What else are you going to be using the laptop for? Are you strictly learning Python right now? Going to be doing any VMs or running Docker? &amp;#x200B; I'm not generally beholden to any specific brand these days. My completely generic suggestion: Find any i5 or i7, with 16GB of RAM, maybe an SSD, with the screen size you can handle.

Yeah I've just started learning. Done a few tutorials online and start reading a few books. My current laptop is shot and takes a long time to do anything hence the reason for getting a new one. Forgive my ignorance but I don't know what VM or docker is so can't answer that. That generic suggestion actually helps a lot. Gives me a good basis to start from so thanks!
Make it emit a series of markdown images references. I'm sure there's a collection of atomic element 'emoji' somewhere.
It spits out a new audio file.

Remindes me Breaking Bad.
I wasn't trying to use Anaconda at all, that was installed a while ago. The Anaconda install just hijacks the path, IDK it's caused problems like this since then. I was unsure about changing it because I've read that changing the $PATH on a system can cause problems with the OS. Anyway I installed pip with Anaconda, and I think since then I've changed it to be a regular install, and virtualenv was installed with the steps in the OpenCV walkthrough listed above. Everything at this point seems to be working. Do you still think I will have problems?
Il found this tuto to get started with printing on python, but depends on how work your printer with Windows. http://timgolden.me.uk/python/win32_how_do_i/print.html
Ignore the VM and Docker references then. Stick with my generic specs. Personally, if you don't regularly hook up to an external monitor, I'd get a 15"+ screen. Good to see newbies that are hungry for learning :) Good luck!
Is this on GitHub? Or could you point me in the direction of how to build this myself?
English is a Germanic language and it uses potassium.
Yeah, I know it's stupid. Just one of my friend wants it, but as a desktop application. So, I thought why should I have another code base, why don't wrap everything in one pack and just give it. 
SIR! You should not go around bragging your code base is small.... it leads to innuendos.

why not use their API's and requests module
Here's it is in turtle (not an entry, just for fun). import turtle turtle.speed(500) def slice(side, level): if level == 1: for i in range(3): turtle.fd(side) turtle.left(120) else: slice(side/2, level-1) turtle.fd(side/2) slice(side/2, level-1) turtle.bk(side/2) turtle.left(60) turtle.fd(side/2) turtle.right(60) slice(side/2, level-1) turtle.left(60) turtle.bk(side/2) turtle.right(60) def main(): slice(200,6) main() turtle.mainloop(1) 
Awesome. Could you implement a solution using object oriented programming and Matplotlib? That’s the challenge. I’ll post my solution later! 
Three options: 1. Use one of the python freezing tools. I did this a long time back for an organization that didn't allow data to go outside the firewall. It worked ok, but there were quite a few things to work around. 2. Ask him to install python, then have a setup script he can run which will do a pip install, Django migrate, create superuser, and runserver. Probably the best option for casual use. 3. Get everything installed into a small VM / docker image. He installs Virtualbox / docker and runs your app.
Used macbook pro 13 2015.
I usually just run it every Wednesday to book the following week. Haven't gotten to/thought about automating the process. 
Nope. Business school in Boston. 
Not sure. Mind explaining why? 
You don't need to run an actual browser if you're just scraping a page. Interacting with javascript is harder and why most people use selenium instead of beautiful soup for example. 
I am blind, thanks. 
If you are a Hollywood tech reading this, I would love to get employed to develop this kind of useless stuff. Please.
Probably. I'll have a dig when I get an hour spare.
If you are running it on your personal machine... you can create a cronjob for this script. Maybe maintain a database of all the schedules, with a script which checks if it has already been booked for this week. One can go into a deep rabbit hole for this 🕳. 
Raspberry pi 3b+ 34 dollars. 
Hmmm I can share the code but I think you may have to write a customs script for your work. Which website do you have to automate?

Unfortunatly that does not work for static ip mapping by mac address and single port to single ip rule addition. 
&gt; Will those who use Linux for a programming job be mocked like those who use Windows? No.
Thanks! Really appreciate it.
Uhh, what. Who the fuck mocks people for their preferred OS?
Linux is arguably the best programming environment depending on your language of choice C was created *for* Linux

I've heard many stories of people being made fun of for "not being a real coder". Some stupid shit about how Macs are better for programming
I've used Linux for the past 20 years and almost all of my career. Never had any issue.
No idea who you've heard that from. I'm on a team that's like half Mac users, one fourth Windows users, one fourth Linux users, and everything works fine for everyone.
There are always zealots out there championing some unnecessary allegiance. However, for the most part I think a little ribbing is all in good fun. My co-workers and I often slip little jabs in at each other about our OS preferences. I tease the OSX and Windows guys, and they give it back to me. At the end of the day it's just an OS and I can be productive on any of them. &amp;#x200B; To answer your question; Yes, Linux is a good environment to develop on.
I use python-telegram-bot and can confirm it's awesome, too
Code like `for _ in range(5)` is pretty standard. The `_`lets the reader know it's a variable that is not used elsewhere, like this instance, where it's only used for iterating over something 5 times. 
It will pick Silicon
My best effort for describing a set of best practices and tooling to be used in Python development. Is there something you’d add/remove?
It's a single file, super short. Two text files, one with the text from the page to save it between runs of the script, the other has my IFTTT API key. [https://pastebin.com/e5ZdECb5](https://pastebin.com/e5ZdECb5)
English is 100% a Germanic language (a West Germanic language, the closest extant language to English is Dutch). Its vocabulary might have a lot of French words, that doesn't make it Romanic. Armenian's almost entire vocabulary is borrowed from Persian but it's not an Indo-Iranian language (it's an isolate language in Indo-European family) (fun fact for about a century linguists thought Armenian is related to Persian because of its unusual vocabulary). A lot of Turkic languages (like Turkmen or Uzbek) borrow a lot of words (more than English borrows from French) from Arabic and Persian. Language family is a genealogical classification, vocabulary doesn't change it (unless we can talk about creolization but English is not a creole language). English borrowed French words after the Norman conquest of Britain, almost exclusively through writing. If you were to make a non-West Germanic case for English, your best bet is Scandinavian, as Old Norse hugely influenced Old English (some authors even thought Middle English being a creole but this is not much evidence of this). Source: I studied linguistics.
Thank you. 
I prefer Linux for programming 100% of the time.
Good idea, I'll try :)

Thanks, I understand what it does. It, however, does not change the fact I had to look very carefully for what h was, and what \_ might contain each iteration. for \_ in h, could mean anything. Shove it into anything that needs a for loop, rename the variable to h. So horrifically non descriptive, it's almost a study in beauty through horror.
but the flask also can use the SQLAlchemy as a ORM 
You guys are absolutely correct, English is a Germanic language. I'm just saying that its modern version has strayed far from its roots, which explains why you have the massive Romanic influence in English, as in Sodium -&gt; Natrium. *Every* other "big Germanic" language uses Natrium (Swedish, Danish, Afrikaans, Dutch, Norwegian, German). 
check for: Dataquest homepage In a short time 3 to 5 months, you will a very good level not only in Python but also in Machine Learning.
No worries. Now you too can be a lazy shit in and not get out of bed to turn off programs. A couple of pointers for using it: - Make sure you use full stops between hrs, mins and seconds. I did it this way because shift and semicolon is too much effort to type. - Current time is the current time into the program if you need to start it from the middle of the program. Set it to zero if not. Let me know if you have any problems with it :)

suck it java
Only partially in python and it all requires additional hardware, but - * I have an aquatic turtle tank - the lights turn on at sunrise, and off at sunset (Wemo + RPi) * It has an aerator, that turns off during my expensive time-of-day hydro billing period (TP-Link smart plug + RPi) * I have a humidifier/air purifier, that only turns on during the 2nd lowest, and lowest time-of-day hydro billing periods (TP-Link + RPi) * I have a couple huge air purifiers, they only turn on during the lowest time-of-day hydro billing period (Wemo + RPi) * When I turn on the TV in the living room at any time of day, all the noisy things in my living room (humidifier, air purifier, turtle aerator) all turn off, they turn back on when the TV goes off (Bravia API + previously mentioned hardware) * *If* my windows are all closed (Insteon Window sensors, old Insteon Hub with a PLM interface I can read via TCP with a script), my temperature is adjusted (Nest) automatically through the day - nice and cool for sleeping, warmer through the day when the hydro is more expensive * If someone opens a window when the air conditioning is on, the thermostat temperature is automatically set very high to cut the cooling (previously mentioned hardware) * When the windows are closed, my furnace fan runs all day and night to keep air fresh and filtered all over the house, when the windows are open, it runs 15 on, 15 off, 15 on 15 off from ~9 PM to 11 AM when people might be in their bedrooms with the doors closed - from 11 AM to 9 PM the fan stays off (all previously mentioned hardware, though I'd love to have additional window/door sensors to actually tell if doors are closed and people are in bedrooms) * Insteon motion sensors all over the house relay their messages to the Hub which are then picked up my a monitoring script on my RPi (perl) which then uses a Python script (yay!) to turn on Hue bulbs in the corresponding area. Brighter through the day, a little softer in the evenings * Additional scripts monitor those lights and turn them off if they've been on too long, in case a "motion cleared" message never made it to the Hub (not uncommon) * When the previously mentioned living room television routine runs, if it is after sunset, it also turns on the Hue bulbs in the lamps flanking my TV. It turns them off (and all the noisy stuff back on) when the TV goes off * I have Hue light strips for a night light in the kitchen, along with a bulb in the range hood - if through the day the kitchen is dark and motion is detected (darkness threshold on the Insteon motion sensor) the lights come on - also at night when they're already on anyway, if someone comes in to the kitchen the brightness goes up a bit - enough that they can actually see what they're doing and don't need to turn on the bright overhead lights That's all I can think of at the moment, hopefully there is some inspiration there!
That's wonderful! I'm inspired haha, I can't wait to be good enough at programming to help people out like this.
How the f*ck is java still on top. IT FRICKIN SUCKS... I’m being forced to learn it for university and every second is excruciating, especially after already knowing c#. The generic type system is flawed, the use of primitives is mind-numbing, the forced package structure and inability to shorten names is irritating, the lack of import aliasing is stupid &amp; the whole language feels badly engineered. Death to Java ┻━┻ミ＼(≧ﾛ≦＼) 
Serious question, what do people use Ada for? From what I can tell, it's the most hipster language one can use. 
Tooling and ecosystem around it. When working on multi-year projects with multiple developers, access to tools (debugger, monitoring, linting, IDE, etc.) and mature (i.e. stable and feature complete) libraries can affect your productivity more than the programming language itself. There is also a ton of inertia from when Java was the hot new thing.
open your mind a bit. it has it's place. 
Yeah, I use a very basic Samba configuration to serve files in the local network, with a 3TB external HDD for storage and a 128 GB external SSD for torrent caching, both mounted at the root. To stream directly to my TV without taking the network detour NAS -&gt; smartphone/laptop -&gt; chromecast (which, in my experience, led to bottlenecks while streaming well encoded 1080p video - should probably upgrade my router), I additionally use [minidlna](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MiniDLNA) to serve media files directly to my TV. All in all, my experience with setting this up was really positive, all of Samba, deluged (for torrenting) and minidlna are basically plug and play and require very little tinkering to work.
Tell me more about the Armenian language. 
Linux is great since it has many Linux Distros have built-in features such as a C compiler (gcc), python interpreters, built-in text editors with syntax highlighting (nano and vim), etc. I am beginning to learn Python but I have been a Windows person all my life. However, I switched to Linux (Debian and Arch) several months ago and never looked back.
&gt; Sad to see where ADA is. Why? 
I guess it started like "I bet you can't write sha-1 implementation in one line"
I want to vnc to my Mac from away. My router won't pass a wake on lan packet. My raspberry pi runs a server listening for a different packet, which can pass through my router, then sends out it's own WOL packet locally.
I would guess these days it's mostly about maintaining legacy code (same with Fortran). 
What would you expect when it is the language taught the most now? It was Java first but now universities are teaching Python. Happy to see C is still up there outside the US. Beautiful.
&gt; how Macs are better Mac are definitely not better, unless "more expensive and lower specced" means "better". Macs are premium priced Unix machines that you cannot upgrade. Unless you specifically want to run Photoshop while "being creative" in a fancy cafe I see no reason to buy a mac. My creative GF has a Mac,it's seriously underspecced and nothing to do about it. She has waited 5 months now for a replacement keyboard from Apple. I bought a thinkpad keyboard for her while she's waiting. My personally preferred tool is a top end thinkpad with linux (kde + *buntu, usually).
It mostly hear about it in DOD and aerospace projects.
Does anyone know why Lisp dropped that much in only 5 years?
&gt;Serious question, what do people use Ada for? From what I can tell, it's the most hipster language one can use. Ada's definitely not a "hipster" language. Taken from Wikipedia (which I agree with): &gt;Because of Ada's safety-critical support features, it is now used not only for military applications, but also in commercial projects where a software bug can have severe consequences, e.g., avionics and air traffic control, commercial rockets such as the Ariane 4 and 5, satellites and other space systems, railway transport and banking. &amp;#x200B;
`{x:x**2 for x in range(1,11)}`? And if you're going to throw list constructors in where they're not necessary just to make something look longer, why not {x:x**2 for x in list(list(list(list(list(list(list(list(list(list(list(list(list(list(list(list(list(list(list(list(range(1,11)))))))))))))))))))))}
I know a lot of scientists who still code in Fortran. It baffles me.
programming languages are tools, not tribes there are things python is good for that java isn't, and vice versa 
Not sure about that source but looks different from the actual site..: [https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) also I don't think TIOBE is trustful at all... because they ignore frameworks and stuff like that. &amp;#x200B; I strongly believe TIOBE only exist to say Java and C are the best, ignoring if they are doing a good job representing the popularity of the languages.
Maybe I’m the minority opinion here but I find that one liners are good in certain occasions, but I prefer readable code almost always so that I’m not the only one that can use the code 
I use a MacOS X laptop because I really like iTerm2, and because I have some Microsoft dependencies for work (MS Office and Teams, mainly). But I do the vast majority of my programming for a Linux environment, for high-availability, computational clusters. Most of the time, I'm using iTerm2 to SSH into a Linux box to get the best of both worlds. It might be different for people working on GUI applications, but at least for the kind of server work I do, the idea of programming **on** MacOS X is laughable. I would probably be in better shape (and my python environment would be less messy) if I could eliminate the MS dependencies and install Linux on my laptop. I *would* miss iTerm2, but the more I think about it, using python and git in their native environment would just be so nice.
Golang conspicuous by its absence

Nothing baffling about it, Fortran has excellent support for high-performance numerical computation. Even numpy and scipy use LAPACK, the linear algebra package written in Fortran.

Since you're listing best practices I would reference PEP 8 coding standards. [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) Even if they are not followed 100%, it deffinitly increases the readability of code.

Cool. Not looking to go there.....just yet, was just curious. Thanx
As someone new to python, is there a way to determine which of these are easier than others? 
Anything to do with security
Cool, I would appreciate it. **First: A disclosure.....I am not a "Programmer" (But, then again, does a programmer ever stop learning?) ....yet, still learning. Currently I am on the Boolean and Condintion Tutorial of python which the -- not -- operater is confusing me a little. Anywho....* So, basically what I would like to do is for the computer/website to "Re-Post" the previous AD's at a certain time on for example....OLX, JunkMail, Gumtree, etc automatically Let's say the post Included a Photo, Location, Ammount, Product....What I want the script to do is just run at say.....09:00AM everyday and post the AD from the previous day.
Ok, so gonna have to back to you on that. I gotto go learn what you just said.....:D
All in favor of AP Computer Science teaching kids python 3 instead of java say I
What is your output for the following commands: *`python -V ` *`which python` *`virtualenv --version` *`which virtualenv` and to see your anaconda installation `conda info`

Let me be the first telling this: would you consider adding [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/) to the list of dependencies management tools? 🧐
Anything code that has to do heavy numerical processing, especially on multiple computers simultaneously. Numpy is great and all, but it's never going to be used for a serious CFD or FEA code. Real CFD codes are not thread safe as that would take too much overhead. It operates on driving the error to 0, but it never gets there. That doesn't mean you can't have a python interface, but just that the work is done in another language.
Anything interactive on the frontend.
This reminds me of those "here's what your teens mean when they say" type slang dictionaries that go around the Internet from time to time.
Wow, this is amazing! I once made a CSS animations library in a similar vein. [Here's the homepage](http://antrikshy.com/Tinseltown.js/) with demos and links to docs etc.
Pretty sure it has more to do with its ubiquity in data science.
Yeah I noticed too
There are often ways to dramatically speed things up. Binary files can get you read speeds at the limits of your drive. Numpy requires say 20 MB of RAM to import, but it gives you easy access to make matrices that take 5x less RAM vs lists with no loss of precision. If your data is really float32s vs float64s or say int8s, you can save even more RAM. Now that you have numpy, you can do math operations 500-1000x faster. Any heavy computational package is written in something like C or Fortran, but many of those are wrapped with Python. People have a tendency to say a popular package is complex (say numpy) or I want to minimize dependencies, so I'll reinvent the wheel, when it would be a better option to add say numpy as an option.
On mobile, so sorry if I miss anything. First, use pandas. It will allow you to do everything your used to in Excel and then some. It looks like once you’ve read it in pandas.read_csv you need to do a group by or a pivot table. Either of these are aggregation functions that should get you most of what you need. If you need to do any filtering you’ll need the .loc function. The dataframe construct is very powerful, try to use it to your advantage! Feel free to pm me if you have questions. 
We are just guessing. From what I see Python is now the default language to teach and has this stigma of "Easy to learn and fast to get shit done". That explains the popularity among users that studied careers that do not focus completely on electronic circuits and programming but that still need programming/computers like data scientists. 
1995.
A second hand thinkpad from one of T400-series, T500-series, X200-series would be fine. I've been very satisfied with x220, w520, x230 - all for quite demanding jobs, running intensive R jobs and several VMs.
Simply Brilliant.

Python, and R. Matlab is dying
Pyqt is pretty good. If traditional apps are what you want.
This is my single complaint.
Python is pretty good though, not without it's flaws, but industry is choosing a right language for once
People stopped using Emacs because they realized that apart from being a great OS it still lacks a decent editor. /s
You just listed everything that C/C++ is good for
You should look into compilers and interpreters, some of them are a lot faster than the others. It again depends what you want to do
In general it is good to know C/C++ for that, pretty much everything else you can get away with on python. Writing web backeend is a breeze on python, I fucking love too much
Java and C# are still the best at handling vast, sprawling codebases and large teams, but these are less common with the advent of microservices and such. Type annotations go a long way in helping the tooling situation for Python but its static checkers are still unusable and you still lack the performance of Java and C# generally required to make those vast codebases realistically runnable. Even under pypy's jit you can't share any of the frequently significant per-process footprints they tend to have between parallel threads.
How does google know that they weren't searching for Python, the snake
Take vs code. It's free. If you need a full IDE there is PyCharm.
My guess is the previous uptick was clojure, which is almost dead now.
Eclipse should not be a consideration for anything ever.
Go Vs Code all the way. 
My vote is for VS Code. I’ve had nothing but luck.
Learn vim!
Thank you sir!
Even the things python is well suited for, say web/api backend development, break down at large scales. Not because of performance, but because the lack of static typing makes managing large code bases increasingly difficult. Large systems are still built in statically typed languages for this reason. 
Yeah I know for a fact some teams at Raytheon uses Ada still for this exact reason. 
Or you could also just use an incognito window
Matlab is alive and well in neuroscience from what I can tell.
Use pandas to read in your dataframe as df. Then try something like: df.groupby('testtitle')\['stepinstruct','stepresult'\].agg({'stepinstruct': regex, 'stepresult': regex}) &amp;#x200B;
Wow, this looks cool
Yes.
Readability &gt; Complexity
It cracked 3rd last month for the first time.
Yup, I work on them. I'm a systems and toolchain engineer and work on a C++ project with a swig wrapper to python. Python is nice for making the tools easier to use but it's considerably slower.
Yeah, that's just interpreted languages in general, but again they are created for different purpose
&gt; which is almost dead now wow, when did it get that bad for clojure? It seemed to be in a good trajectory adoption-wise when I looked at it years ago, but I haven't been keeping up with it.
Getting the exact same answer on say every computer on every OS for a numerical code seems overly picky. I moved the 1/3, so I get a different answer is just builtin to IEEE. It's still the "right" answer to almost machine precision. I'll take the compiler optimization. CFD codes don't get the exact same answer on the same base hardware with a different number of processors even when written in C. They're not thread safe because it's not worth the overhead. They're trusted though.
It's changing, at least from what I've heard from my friends in that field. It will take some time before old tools are ported to Python, but that's an excellent job for new PhD students to understand the underlying algorithms. 
Ever figure out how to get swig to work with 64 bit python?
{}
I use sublime as my permanent tool. People say it's not IDE feature rich - but that's because they haven't looked at the plugins. And it handles silly enormous files. And multi-cursor... and hot start - crash proof. There is no need for Eclipse or Pycharm or any of these full-fat every-button, boxes of bug.
I use a MacBook air for personal projects. Definitely not as nice as the MacBook pro I got through work, but it gets the job done and was relatively cheap.
Drop box is built with python, but then again they use static typing a lot with mypy and function annotations. Also Guido works for them.
Nano is also good option for beginners
Well, Reddit, YouTube, Instagram and a lot of Amazon AWS's backend are all written in Python. I think it has it's limits but massively scaled web/API is not really one of them imo
This is more about how file paths are a pain. Unicode unfriendly and not portable. Unix paths are technically defined as bytes, but no one expects to receive bytes, so python does what it can. Don't think any other language does a fundamentally better job, sure they could just force feed you the raw platform native format and let you sort it out yourself, but that really just shifts the burden of solving the problem to individual devs. Most people expect that when they access a file with e.g. Japanese characters in the name, they will see and manipulate Japanese not a mess of bytes. 
* Speed * Memory requirements * The environment doesn't support python well because it was built by Apache.
Nearly all high school computer science classes are taught in Java. I dont think attributing this trend to schools is quite fair.
I like pycharm, it has excellent refactoring tools. I haven't been able to replicate that functionality on VBC yet.
Yeah my biggest thing with MATLAB is it's just already such mature software. They have functions for everything I want to do.
You will learn to simplify as you go. Sounds silly but if you are gonna keep repeating things even if it is 2 lines I like to make a function to call it helps me a lot but everyone is different 🤷🏼‍♂️
[How greedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm) ;)
Well that’s an oddly specific field.
Dropbox uses Go and Rust for a lot of their backend systems. They used Python originally, until they couldn't.
I'm a bit confused about your GRP and Daynum and the purpose of this, as you either set grp to 0 or it doesn't exist, but this should work for you. &amp;#x200B; It accepts a date, classified as the input now and returns the 3 results you want. Then you plug them into you function for even options to get the position. It should do everything you need. &amp;#x200B; import datetime &amp;#x200B; Oddoptions = { 0 : ( "a","b","c","d"), 1 : ("i","j","k","l"), 2 : ("q","r","s","t"), 3 : ("x","y","z",0), 4 : (4,5,6,7) }; Evenoptions = { 0 : ("e","f","g","h"), 1: ("m","n","o","p"), 2: ("u","v","w","x"), 3: (1,2,3,"\["), 4: (8,9,"&lt;","&gt;"), }; &amp;#x200B; def colnum\_calc(now = [datetime.datetime.now](https://datetime.datetime.now)().date()): if now.weekday() &gt;= 5: daynum = 0 grp = 0 else: daynum = now.weekday() &amp;#x200B; wk = now.isocalendar()\[1\] lowers = \[0, 10\] + \[10+x\*8 for x in range(1,5)\] uppers = \[x\*8 for x in range(1,7)\] + \[50\] bounds = \[1, 4, 8, 13, 17, 21, 25\] val = 0 while True: val += 1 lower = lowers\[val\] upper = uppers\[val\] bound = bounds\[val\] if lower &lt;= wk &lt;= upper: colnum = wk-(wk//2+bound) break; return colnum, daynum, grp
CFD codes do no have randomness at least not that I've seen. Turbulence is typically done using a Spalart-Almaras model. That one is not random and very standard. I'm not clear why it's it's not thread safe, but from some googling, it's seems to have to do with face based methods vs cell vs node based methods as well as CPU vs GPU. I thought the issue came down to how the sparse matrix is solved for.
Existence of vast sprawling codebases does not make a language best for project. Rust is winning systems programming at the moment due to memory and multithreading safety without giving up low level control. Nothing will ever beat sexp-based languages for metaprogramming. 
Things like air traffic control and avionics. Stuff where a bug will cause death and destruction.
That's not a string...
Kinda surprised how low JS is
That's a list, right? 
Yea, sorry, I have the same question for both strings and lists and mixed it up
Yes, that's what I meant, mb
 It's 'all in favor say "aye"', by the way. 
I don't think its particularly readable, no matter how common.
I'm in einem/electrical engineering and while we learn C# at school I think Python is far superior (learning Python privately).
it is growing fast. I'm not seeing crazy growth on the web though, like it still seems Wordpress is far and away more popular then Django CMS. If something like Django CMS could really start taking market share from Wordpress/PHP I think that could be huge for growth. I read that Wordpress powered sites recieve 22 billion page views/month and Wordpress still powers 27% of the web
&gt;Python 3 Haha
I like Lisp's little uptick in 13 probably because of Clojure then boom straight into the dumpster. 
It's not. Python's bytecode is basically shortening the language while Japa compiles to a lower level language which could be compared to the assembly of an imaginary machine. 
Since Dependency Walker was not updated since 2008 and I had some problems with it on Windows 10, I decided to build my own Dependency Walker in Python, trying to improve on it while also learning many aspects of Python. 
Thanks a lot for your reply! I will probably be setting something up like this in the near future and much appreciate the advice.
Java uses JIT compilation, you could compare it to PyPy but not really to CPython which is a pure interpreter.
Hoorayyy my skillset is saturating in the job market!!! 
No, it’s not. Those .pyc files you see are compiled bytecode waiting to run on the CPython VM.
You dont even need actual programmers to manage wordpress, meaning its really easy. Thus it is also really cheap to use wordpress. Because of this it is really popular.
I think the guy above you was referring to compiling as in compiling to object code and then linked into some machine code rather than compiled to byte code and then run on a VM.
how to live without generics?
As an engineer I see them everywhere, and I'm still trying to get myself to learn it.
Ah, yeah, if it uses an iterative solver, that may also explain why the results depend (slightly) on number of CPUs and how the mesh is partitioned. But please note that this algorithmic feature is not the same as a lack of thread safeness! Thread safety is a property of a piece of code (typically a function), which means that it can run in parallel with itself. This basically means that it must not modify any global state of the computing system, or do so very carefully. An example of a not thread-safe function is a RNG that stores the current seed in a internal static variable, or the standard POSIX function for retrieving the error message corresponding to an error code, which writes the result to a global buffer. A thread safe variant of these would take the address in which to store the current seeds, and the buffer in which to write the error message, as input arguments, or only work inside it's own stack space.
Which is why "compiled languages" refers to C++. Python tends to be [slower](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/faster/python.html) than Java due to dynamic typing more than anything else. I say this as someone who **hates** Java.
I love how VB.NET is more popular than JS. 
Actually my current job with the Navy is doing C++ stuff in the backend, with Java for the GUI front-end.
Granted, it's quite the hyperbole.

They all seem difficult to me.
A professor at my university decided to teach Python 2, it hurts.
I'm working on my first project after learning python through a udemy course. I'm making what I am calling GM Notepad, a program that helps GMs/DMs generate NPCs, calculate encounter difficulties based on average party levels, and some other stuff. Hopefully going to turn this into a cross platform app!
Exactly
Programming in Python is like writing a recipe, and the Python interpreter is like a cook slow at reading. So if your recipe is like this: 1. Take carrot 2. Take knife 3. Chop piece of carrot 4. Goto 2 while carrot left It will take ages to perform that. If your recipe looks like: 1. From madskillz import carrotChopper 2. carrotChopper(carrot) It will be super fast. Especially since the carrotChopper function was written once and for all by a chopping genius using some crazy acceleration methods your average programmer joe can't even comprehend.
Tell that to academia. 
Obviously people are just looking to see some Monty Python sketches. 
What’s wrong with python 3
Nothing at all! It’s great. It’s just a shame that industry adoption has been so slow, which is the premise of my poorly conveyed joke. :^]
