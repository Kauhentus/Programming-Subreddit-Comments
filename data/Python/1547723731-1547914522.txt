Consider also if non-technical users should ever see an error message. Error messages are fine for libraries as your consumer is a developer. If your product is a facebook app or a computer game, it may be better to do something else instead.
Beyond the examples willm gave, you could think of the context manager as not a resource context, but a security or capability context. A program written exclusively with pyfilesystem and without os or other libraries, could not write outside the designated directories in the designated contexts. As I said I don't like either pathlib or pyfilesystem, but I respect that pyfilesystem has this opinion. Pathlib just seems utterly pointless to me and I've yet to see any explanation for why I should use it instead of just os.path.
Ok, that makes perfect sense. Thanks for the explanation!
Numpy, my boi, what did you do this time.

many tools used to use `python` in scripts and shebangs. gyp was a [particularly](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/pull/527) stubborn [offender](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/1030).
The explanation of timeit library for showing effectiveness is really very good
Meh. Backwards compatibility is overrated, IMO. As long as you can pin versions somehow, that's all that matters. Sometimes it's good for software to die. Glad that Python2 is getting sunsetted. 2020 can't come fast enough in that regard.
Oh yeah 100% lol
You don’t understand. When people use `python` in scripts and shebangs, the software depends on the global `python` binary to point to `python2`. Version pinning doesn’t help, only horrible hacks like prepending to `$PATH` or so.
Thank you !!
Found out the answer... I had in my `nginx.conf` file set `user nobody nobody;` set back to `user nginx;` and everything works... Don't ask me why and why this was the only app that had a problem with this...
My first real Python/programming project! Last week I started experimenting with while loops and conditional growth. &amp;#x200B; I'm now building something resembling a city simulator. [https://github.com/idealase/CitySim](https://github.com/idealase/CitySim) I'm trying to follow best practice as I learn, but I'm using wildcard imports and the namespaces are a little janky. Any thoughts on structuring are appreciated.
Who still *does* that?
I did! (Well, 9 years) It was a little rough back then, since there was so little stuff ported!
I know, I wasn't arguing against that point...
 #useful_tools.py import useful_tools # you're importing yourself here Python will look in the current folder first for import targets. Rename-something to fix this. Questions of this type should be on /r/learnpython.
Thank you, I’ll post in there.
What you're looking for is a Fourier transform.
Thanks for commenting, I will take a look at this code today. Unfortunately, the only time I need to access a tab is when it's created automatically when I click a button so simply accessing those new tabs as I selector.click() buttons will be key.
I wish I couldn’t answer to that question, but the list is long
nope, the remainder of a path object and a string. You can still regard that as silly, but portraying the types as other than what they need to be for it to even run is disengenuous.
Could you not just set the username and password as environment variables to save them being stored in the python file?
&amp;#x200B; Is this the kind of thing i am looking for? &amp;#x200B; def plot\_data(in\_data): \# get and convert the data to float audio\_data = np.fromstring(in\_data, np.int16) \# Fast Fourier Transform, 10\*log10(abs) is to scale it to dB \# and make sure it's not imaginary dfft = 10.\*np.log10(abs(np.fft.rfft(audio\_data))) 
Yes, but you need to understand it, not just copy/paste code from Google.
&gt;since Python doesn't allow operator overloading Surely you'd already seen examples like `17 % 5` &amp; `"Hello %S" % 'world'` and `2 + 3` and `[3, 4, 5] + [6]` ?
yeah, I was just finding something to base my code off of. Thanks for the help!
Used decorators blindly and extensibly while developing a parser using RPLY. Now I know it inside out. Thanks a lot. Cheers!
It's not the code that you need to understand, it's the math behind it.
Have you tried generating the URLs which are generated via the button click? This would likely simplify your task somewhat. 
Thanks. I just downloaded this book and scroll down to puzzle section. All puzzles in this books are for beginner and very easy to solve, anyone who doesn't know about programming can understand this book content and can solve the puzzle.

 rmvirtualenv math_venv_name &amp;&amp; mkvirtualenv math_venv_name &amp;&amp; pip install numpy &amp;#x200B;
Numpy doesn’t follow semver; not even close. Don’t you remember the great array class refactor of 1.10? Also, in my mind, install is not part of the API, so it would still be no. You can swap out a dependency and leave the API and the capability the same. The fact pip can’t do it does not affect numpy’s release notes.
I would but the URL remains the same, from which an embedded pdf must be downloaded before closing that tab and moving on to the next button click on the main page, which generates the same url but presents a different file.
If you ever would like some assistance or anything on this, I’d love to work on it! I’ve been looking for a project to contribute to and I think this is brilliant!!
If it's any consilation, when they python developers released 3.0 it was really more "3.0alpha" in SEMVER speak. 3.1 was "3.0beta" and 3.2, released in 2011, was the first version really encouraged for public use wholesale.

As a side note, I noticed something interesting. $ alias python=python3 $ which python /usr/bin/python $ ls -l /usr/bin/python lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 9 Jan 1 01:23 /usr/bin/python -&gt; python2.7 $ python --version Python 3.6.7 Looks like the *which* command doesn't obey aliases. TIL.
I’m using the apps SoloLearn and Encode, they’re pretty good for the basics
I would reconsider forking this library just to change one specific thing. IMHO, it seems to me to be in bad taste... I am in the single quotes camp but there was an issue on the issue tracker that discussed this extensively, eventually they added a `-S` flag to avoid converting quotes to double quotes as a compromise.
conda ftw
Can we ban people who have been caught reposting stuff multiple times? It doesn't happen often here, but reddit is becoming 90% reposts as people race to get meaningless karma. I am sick of seeing the same memes with may be a few words changed everyday. 
For some reason I though that MKL supported GPU. Apparently it doesn't. So, you are right, you'd need something extra for that. That's why I mentioned `conda` on Windows: iirc, it installs it by default.
hm, i started with C and C++, which both have the concept of scope. The only language before python, that i somewhat used that does not have the concept of a scope is assembler, but that is something completely different. Also, Python wasn't my first dynamic language. Before i learned Python, i worked with Lua. And Lua does quite a few things different than Python. If we ignore the fact, that by default all variables are globals in Lua, variables defined as local have the typical C style scope, so it is doable even in dynamic languages. But on another note, i maybe should not have called it retarded, although i myself have some notes for most languages/libraries i use there i mark things i think are retarded, but naming it "significantly different than the usual approach to a problem" would be better i guess.
When I read the title I was certain this post is on r/ProgrammerHumor.
Apart from my other comment about scopes, i think there are a few more things to note that should be included: int: it is not a type with a set length, but a type that can store any sized integer and thus overflow does not happen Division: int / int -&gt; float contrary to any other language there it would be the same as int // int in python
Posts like these make me curious how many people rely only on `pip` to handle their installation of popular packages and libraries. `conda` is slow but it works much better for me than `pip` alone.
Thanks - I hadn't stumbled upon those. 
You need to configure an HTTP/proxy server. As you have a ”domain.com” already you need to modify the server (eg. Apache or nginx) configuration to listen to port 80 and serve your location with the port 8888.
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; int main () { int x; printf("Number?"); scanf("%d", &amp;x); if (x == 0) printf("zero"); else if (x % 2 == 0) printf("even"); else printf("odd"); } 
Makes sense to me. It's elegant. I find coding in Python the most fun out of any language. Javascript is a mess. Java is heavy, and while it is good for enterprise projects, it isn't for lighter stuff. C# is similar. C and C++ are too low level for most development these days, unless you **need** speed (but then, the part you need speed for you can always write in C and wrap with Python...), PHP has gotten better, but it's still nowhere near elegant. Ruby feels like Python without the cool libraries associated with Python.
Thanks for the explanation, that's a good way to store data! BTW, when I said I wanted to store it with minimum space(without compression), I meant, if I want to store a byte, say 0100 0001, if i create a string "0100 0001" and write it to a text file. I'm actually saving 8 bytes of ASCII characters 0 (0x30) and 1 (0x31). So I'm actually wasting 7/8 ths of the space. I got it now.. thank you very much!!
Will try this one! Thanks!
Don't write strings. Construct bytes using above method (google "bit shifting" and "bit masking") or any other, then write them in binary mode as bytes.
You should do your own homework. I had the “privilege” of getting colleagues who passed school like you and they expected that other will do their work at their place of employment, too. Was not fun. 
good news - python is popular now so I don't have to use perl anymore bad news - r/python is full of homework now

C++ is actually quite high level if you use all the "modern stuff". You can often avoid raw pointers and memory management.

I've switched from Perl to Python recent years also. But for small text processing tasks I may still use Perl. 
C++'s learning curve is insane compared to almost any other language out there, though. It combines concepts from Java/C#, Python, C, Perl, and others -- so nevermind newbies, it can become an architecture decision obstacle ever for veterans.
I mean, that's just as secure. If they can look at your source code they can probably look at your environment variables, right? Unless your thinking sometime just emails the source code out or something?
But if you are developing pretty large projects (e.g, more than 50K or even 100K LOC for one person projects), you may be missing the strong and static type in C++ and Java.
I see thanks for the tip I’ll definitely add that 
This is fairly safe (really only open to threats that would already be inside your own network) but if you want to take it a step further you could encrypt the passwords and store the key. At the very least you should have them in plain text.

It is to be expected as more and more companies are starting to realize the importance of data analysis. This also explains the rise of R, which has been sitting on the bottom and is now "threatening" other popular languages such as PHP and Ruby. Also, as other user mentioned, Python is elegant and fun to write and this definitely plays a big role too. At first, I thought every high level programming language should have this very same feel, but turns out even amongst other languages of its kind, Python is still quite unique.
Glad to help man. Cheers!
I mean, for example, monitoring system, attendance system, etc. going to make a software for the good of others. just for my project in school. 
Fair comment.
Perhaps he is trying to justify the standardization protocol of the standard library when utilizing the block chain to create a more immerse 3D microservice experience. 
And what exactly you want know? Whether Python is good for this matter?

Thanks! :) I will let you know once I push wip changes and come up with list of clear list of things to do. (ETA a week or two). 
As far as I can tell, no. 
That's why I said that Java was fine for enterprise stuff. I suppose large scale personal projects would fit into that same frame too.
And running them on a CI system that uses both.
Trying to gain back my momentum at learning python. I document my learning at for anyone else to see: [https://github.com/kuroop/python-notes](https://github.com/kuroop/python-notes)
Check the documentation for that application, the answers to this question are related to that application and networking. This isn't python related. Also, questions go in /r/learnpython or the python discord. Please consult the sidebar for more information.
That's what originally Perl was created for, so no surprise it is better at it.
Thanks. It was just new to me, and at the time I was focusing on getting PyQT under my belt. I’ll definitely give it a try now though, thanks. 
Python was the first language I "learned". &amp;#x200B; First language I tried to learn was C. Second language was C++. &amp;#x200B; Coming full circle, I feel comfortable w/ C/C++ now that I understand the underlying Computer Science. &amp;#x200B; Learning Rust now.
Been coding in C# for a couple of years but find myself using Python more and more. Might just be me but I find that I get things done quicker in Python than in C# and I also enjoy it more.
these are good! what about the sprites?

Your second post asking people to do your own homework. This sounds like a GCSE/high school task, why pick the subject if you rely on others? You won’t learn if you don’t apply yourself and do your own research and development, and if you don’t learn - you fail the exam...
I first learned C++, the took a run at C, then Scheme. Python is the best parts if all if them. Emacs is my IDE, which really helps. 
Well... what is a file, and what is the smallest unit you can write, and from whose perspective?.. you cannot really answer any of these questions unconditionally. The conditions are: who are the programs handling your data all the way down to the actual storage. Here's an example, which tries to illustrate complications, but is not the general case. Say, you have a VM in a cloud from some popular cloud service provider, then this is what may be happening: 1. When you write to the file, the guest operating system gets called. 2. It then finds that the file is handled by VFS module of the kernel. 3. VFS delegates the work of writing a file to EXT4. 4. EXT4 delegates the work of writing a file to JBD2. 5. JBD2 delegates the work to `multipathd`. 6. `multipathd` delegates work to `iscsid`. 7. `iscsid` pops back into kernel and delegates the work to `ip` module. 8. `ip` module sends your data to the host operating system. 9. Host kernel gets the data from its `ip` module. 10. Host `ip` module sends this data to `iscisd`. 11. `iscisd` sends this to `vmfs`. 12. `vmfs` sends this to SSD driver. 13. SSD driver sends this to the controller on the disk. 14. Controller actually writes the data to the disk, somehow. Now, the fun part: every entity in this chain may have different buffer sizes... It is really difficult to find the appropriate buffer size that will incur least overhead. But, in this scenario, it will never be a single byte. Most likely it will be 4Kb. But, different entities in this pipeline will pretend to accept different buffer sizes, and will do all sorts of merging and caching, however, they can also often can be instructed to not to engage in this monkey business. So, whose perspective is important to you? If it's Python and operating system, then they will pretend that you can write single bytes (but in reality you cannot, and if you will insist, the system will read the remaining X-1 bytes from the device and then write X-1 + your byte to the device, which, as you can guess, is extremely inefficient.
I made them if that's what you're asking.
"Python is the second best language for any application" &amp;#x200B; I take that as a compliment, not insult. 
You're probably right. I assumed accessing the source code would be easier but I'm a bit of a noob 😅
I still love Perl. Get off my lawn.
When I first started coding many people said Javascript was the way to go and that object oriented programming was the thing to do. They made it sound like that was the one and only way to code and the only paradigm to adopt. I learned that coding is similar to basketball. There’s a lot of different players in the game...but it’s how you play the game that sets you apart. I feel like python has that flexibility. I’m not too experienced but that’s just how it feels so far. It reminds me of algebra. I always liked it in high school but in python I really see Algebra shining. And I mean just the basic parts of defining variables. The next language I want to learn will be c++. But before all that I want to make sure I have most of the programming paradigms understood. It seems that like the nfl, certain playstyles may be trendy one year and not so much the next. But knowing the fundamentals never changes.
Cool! I'm not very experienced with Python but I'm experienced with dying in Dark Souls. A cool addition would be to extend this so that it works with modded death messages.
The term you want to search for is "deploying". There are a lot of possible approaches. One common way to deploy python web applications is to run them behind a reverse proxy server like nginx. In this scenario, nginx is running on port 80, and proxies requests to your application, which is still running on port 8888. Usually, the nginx server would also be configured to serve static files, as it is much more efficient St this task than your python application will be. You can also use nginx as a load balancer to multiple running instances of your python application. 
you're pretty good and i wish you luck with your ongoing projects ^^
The scikit-image 14.1 package statically imports __array_function, and completely breaks with new versions of numpy! Don't import hidden variables folks.
See also [oitnb](https://pypi.org/project/oitnb/) for single-quote Black, which also adds some nice features like meld support.
Are you running in ipython or jupyter? Try running your application from the command line. Most interactive Python systems will inline generated plots with code.
I'm still looking into machine learning but I think it shouldn't be too hard since they often share colour or position on the screen Thanks for the suggestion!
Any guidance how to do that please?
Not sure if it's a possibility for you since it's a class project, but why not pursue this as a reinforcement learning task? Your inputs could be the position of the snakes head + rest of the body on the board as well as where the mouse is (is that what the thing you're eating is called? idk). Then let the game play itself and learn over time. &amp;#x200B;
&gt; As well as speed, memory usage is often a factor with datascience or scientific Python. What are you arguing here? Python has a lot of datascience and scientific librairies that have C/C++ backends so you never actually has any C/C++ yourself.

What I forgot to mention is that even if the company hires me for this internship, I'm gonna \*have\* to build something before I start working for them, because, well, it's been 2 years since I used Python. But anyway, I really need to apply first thing next week so it can't be a super big project.

For what my 2 cents is worth, nginx is probably your best bet if you've never done this before. Their [documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/) is pretty good. If you have enough knowledge to get as far as you have, you should be able to install and configure nginx to serve your app with little trouble. For further help you might want to hit up r/learnpython to see what they have to say.
Has search engine popularity been demonstrated to be a reliable metric of actual popularity? 
A lot
Why does the company care about your skills if they aren't paying you? :/ But, generally, hiring process is very random, so, any advise is a kind of voodoo magic... Will any of your strategies make a positive impression on the person reading the resume? -- Who knows... And even if one is more likely to make a positive impression than the other, the difference is probably no more than a single digit percentage points. If they likely to ask you to write something in Python, I think it's a good idea to work on a project beforehand, so that, at least, you'll have your working environment set up.
Thanks for the answer. The reason why I think they care about my skills is that they maybe will have to train me on other technologies related to Python. Btw, do you think in the interview they'll ask me to write some code or did you mean when I start working for them ?
Nice little project, I doubt that you'll get better results with machine learning. You have no variability in the death message ('YOU DIED'), so your simple cross-corrélation is the best solution.
Is it stopped working? I try to "ask frame" and nothing happens. Chrome.
no

Very quick to bang out some code but a major pain in the ass to maintain. What is this "table" argument, ohh it's a map. What are the keys? Let's see "table_name" is the only one used in this function, what function do I call to get a map of table attributes? In Java the parm would be a TableMetaData and searching for all uses of that class would yield the answer quickly 
I’m learning Python right now. I’m really enjoying it. Such an easy to read language and super flexible. If only it could replace JavaScript. JS would be the second language I try to learn but I really don’t care much for it’s syntax.

I would say (from my experience, obv) that learning curve with Python (any language really) flattens in about 3 years - I mean, after that you really stop learning new things by yourself and rather just discover things other people do/did (and this stage last forever.) If it is your first language, though, you should add some start-up time to learn to code in general. Forgive me for meaningless use of figures, but I would say 20-30% of trv Pythonista(TM) in a year.
C and wrap in python, is that Cython?
Thanks!
Not for low to mid level machine learning. Most ML libraries are only available in Python, so good luck using anything else.

JavaScript is great. What about it’s syntax do you dislike?
Things like tensorflow are all written in C or Cpp so what's the problem? Why python isn't suitable for "low to mid" ML? I'm just generally curious 
Tensorflow is the most common and you can use TensorflowJS if you’re a JS programmer I really don’t like Javascript, but it seems like with JS you can do pretty much everything now
Cool stuff. I assume you have tried other Python scraping frameworks. Why do you prefer Scrapy?

Describe your original use case because what you are asking does not make much sense. 
Pybind
Right so let’s say I have a class called Dude, who have the characteristic “self.house”. I have two instances of that class - “John” and “Mark” who both have a different “self. House” Outside of their class, if I were to refer to the self.house variable for them, I would have to type something like “if (John.House or Mark.House) = True:...” etc Instead of referring to them separately in that or statement, would it be possible that I can refer to both of them at once, as like say “Dude.House” or something? Does that clarify it? I don’t really know how to refer back to my original case with a huge code dump
Great work! Seems really cool. Had one question. How can I deploy my python package so that other people can pip install it on their own system?
As far as I know it is not possible to do that directly. And that is good. Because what would that mean? Suppose .house is a Boolean. What would Person.House mean? Any of them has a house? All of them?
No single method has proven to be the best way to measure these things. TIOBE Index uses search engine results, PyPL uses search engines, but limits the findings to tutorial-based results to measure how many posts are in regards to learning a language. RedMonk uses GitHub repos as a metric which is reliant on GitHub's ability to properly categorize the majority language in a repo. StackExchange publishes a list based on tagging. There are literally dozens of language popularity lists and they all use a different method to really come to their conclusions. While none of them are really wrong, none of them capture the whole picture.
Not really...
Bullshit. You don't know if the trend keeps going up or if it can beat Java in a professional setting. This is not how statistic works. 
Use `all` or `any` with a list. https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functions.html#all if any([x.House for x in people]): ... If you use a class variable all instances will share the same value, but thats something else and probably not what you wanted to do.
I’ll try it and see what happens. Thanks :)
&gt; You can often avoid raw pointers and memory management entirely and treat it almost like C#. The problem, however, is that most sources teaching C++ just teach it as "C but with objects" and keep it a lot lower-level than it needs to be.
&gt; Why python isn't suitable for "low to mid" ML? He's trying to say that Python is the _very best_ -- not the second best -- for ML. 
Starting my first set of tutorials in python. Want to automate a few things that I have to do daily. just to save some time. 
You should have a look at the typing module. It helps a lot
On deployment to the middle east, and decided to jump into learning to program. Picked up a Codecademy subscription and started some basic classes. Not sure what my goal is, but it's been interesting so far. 
You should share this on /r/LearnPython if you haven't already. 
Why do you think JS is a mess ?
The worst thing for me is you try and do the "modern stuff" and it's impossible to not fall into some old way of doing things because of old content on the net, or just because it's still available.
It's a useless picture anyway. Who cares how popular a language is? As long as you can hire developers / get hired for know it, whatever.
WebAssembly will make Python in the web client a reality... eventually. Though maybe a long eventually.
Thank you!
Well I know it’s certainly great. It’s very popular and you can do so much with it, especially now with NodeJS for backend stuff. Maybe I haven’t been fair and given it much time to be honest. The syntax complaint is more so with the extra symbols like commas and curly brackets. Python just reads more naturally to my eyes. JS was actually the first language I wanted to learn, but then I discovered Python and realized it could probably help me learn more about how the backend works with connecting services and such. Also just the general OS scripting stuff like automating basic tasks, web scraping, and basic CLI applications or simple GUI programs. I’m at the point where I think learning those fundamentals will help me later. I suppose I’m just not as interested in front end development right now. I want to learn backend logic first, then work my way to the front. My real intention I suppose is to learn JS as I need it. 
I cannot vouch for pandas but I would believe that. But then you have libraries like numpy, scipy, scikitlearn and all the automatic differenciation libraries for deep learning that you simply do not have in C/C++ but they still have backends in C/C++ or even Fortran in the case of numpy and scipy.
Sure, just bind the key events and mouse events to a function that sets a variable to the current time. Have a function that is called every second or every minute to check if its current time is 10 minutes after the event set time.
My current experimentation with deep learning involves the Go boardgame engines (Alpha Zero clones). They wouldn't work in Python because of a lack of efficiency (even with the ML libraries), though we do use Python in the training pipeline.
JavaScript is not great. Transpilers/TypeScript really help but at most they get you parity to Python. But a shitty Python that still gobbles up errors and lets you do something like Math.ceil("") -&gt; 0.
That's why comments are so important. I think I'd rather have bad python with comments than great Java without them. We do have type annotations now, and libraries for compile time static checking though.
Ugh Java might become the new COBOL and just stay around forever being all enterprisy and stuff
These are my three languages to be a good programmer, C to learn strict procedure / memory management, Lisp (or a dialect) to learn functional meta programmning, and Python to get shit done.
Ya I’ve heard of that possibility. It would be nice if people could write browser code in the language of their choice. I know there’s Brython and Transcrypt as Python JS replacements but haven’t looked much into them. Right now I’m just at the beginning stages of learning Python. I shouldn’t even be thinking that far yet. Lol
Or you could document your code.
Ah, yes, my bad! 
Haven't done any coding for months but I'm finally getting back into it. I'm working on my first bigger project, a simple expense tracker (terminal version) for myself. Just something I really need. - Add and remove expenses - View expenses (by date, timerange, category, store etc.) - Automatic backups of database - Automatic removal of old backups - Export database to CSV - Log for user activity Might do a GUI version afterwards to learn that side as well.
Python will be as ubiquitous as electricity. Internet archeologists mark my word. My prophecy shall come true.
It was a joke comment on a joke meme post. Relax. I get it. You’re a COBOL dev for a bank on their atms. ;)
Hey mate, Probably better to ask in r/learnpython . This sub is more of showground for the work you have done. 
Use'em if you want'em https://pypi.org/project/more-itertools/
I did help here: https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/
In practice, we found that porting the tests was almost as much effort as porting the code. Both the existing code and the existing tests play fast and loose with unicode support, so to fix the tests you need to figure out whether the code should be binary or text based (which isn't just a point decision - you also need to think about the code it depends on), at which point you've pretty much figured out how to fix the code anyway. But that was the basic plan I put to the client: use failing tests to direct migration, add mypy type hints to interfaces to clarify type usage, and start by proactively migrating the most isolated bits of code, and shared libraries. They just couldn't find the space in the delivery schedule. 
Tox is great for this
Yeah, that's a severe limitation.
I love Python and JS tbh. Python is great for scripting and doing data science stuff. But all my frontend dev is in JS (obviously) and I use to love Django/Flask but I've started to prefer using Node on the backend as well. Having one language on the entire stack is nice and I like the way Javascript deals with async.
Er, Python deals with async the exact same way, unless you mean promises?
Understandable. You do get used to the curly brackets and semi colons and stuff pretty quick though. They are pretty annoying when first starting out.
I had to learn C first back in university and as much as I hated it back then, it forced me to understand things like pointer and basics of memory management. I think this made me a better developer. On the other hand, it's probably really helpful if you're able to create a meaningful program relatively fast without frustration when you're learning. I'm really not sure which approach is better.
Pandas is based on numpy which in in turn is largely written in C.
Yeah, that game over screen is pretty much perfection for identification as it is. What is the computer going to learn about a consistent input of red text in the middle of a black screen that you don't already know?
Yeah Promises. My bad
Because there's 14566 libraries that all basically try to be the standard lib. Also js itself has been cobbled together in 6 weeks (literally!) and still suffers from backwards compatibility issues. To me, js often feels, well, weird. There's nothing build in, many things feel unnecessarily complicated.
Ya I’m sure. It’s something I’ll have to eventually learn to work with. It’s probably a workflow thing also, finding the right IDE or editor that can help speed those things out. 
Tooling is still a major pita. Let's say you know what you want to write, but you forget the exact method spelling or parameter order. In my Eclipse/Java environment I simply hit ctrl+space and a list pops up. In Pycharm, IDLE, Jupyter and VSC this simply does not work properly. Maybe it does with the standard library, but that's pretty much it. I really like Python, and I'm advocating for it in my organization, but it's really not suited for large scale, long lived Enterprise™ apps - at least not in its current state. And if you worked in any major software project you also know that proper documentation is about as likely as world peace.
The popularity and trends in popularity give you a rudimentary overview of how high your chance of hiring/getting hired for a language is
I've heard good things about [Thonny](https://thonny.org/). For what it's worth, my gf who is learning python prefers it to PyCharm. It also comes with a simple and easy to use debugger.
Popularity doesn't equal to better.
I don't understand how the `quit()` function causes the program to exit. All it does is do a `print()`
Well, take the first rule of linux kernel development: never break user space. You're sort of trading off the conceptual purity of tidying up for turning older scripts into timebombs and that's a bit of a hard sell. The safer route is what RHEL is trying: get rid of "python" altogether and if you want python2 or python3 that is what you called.
Forget about ML for the moment. First learn the basic concept of programming (variables, loops, branching, datastructures, functions, ...). These are essentially the same in any language (they're concepts 😊). Learn to apply these concepts in your language of choice by writing some small programs. As a first programming language Python is quite nice and easy to learn. Once you feel comfortable with this, move to the next level... And oh yeah... /r/learnpython is there to help you learn...
Or because some part o the modern stuff is incomplete over some domain that you just happen to be working in, so you've got _no choice_ but to make your `auto lambda` do bit fiddling using what's essentially C. Not that I don't like C, mind you -- I love it. I just hate inconsistency.
Well, take the first rule of linux kernel development: never break user space. You're sort of trading off the conceptual purity of tidying up for turning /usr/bin/python scripts into risks (Will it run on python 3? I dunno, but your computer's gonna try it anyway) and that's a bit of a hard sell outside of something bleeding edge like Arch. The safer route is what RHEL is trying: get rid of "python" altogether and if you want python2 or python3 that is what you called.
if you're new to programming I would first learn the basics, then if you got that covered have a look at the scikit-learn package 
Yeah, I know, I've been personally responsible for some of that missing documentation and uncommented code. I try not to, but sometimes deadlines happen. You can write plenty large scale stuff in Python, but Enterprise is just a completely different thing. I do embedded, desktop, and web, so I rarely run into anything that seems like Java would be a good fit(Although I do want to learn Kotlin and Android), but I'd probably feel different if I was doing a lot of more businessy legal-y payroll/customer/database/inventory kind of stuff.
The amount / quality of job listings is a better gauge.
Go and download Anaconda. Play around with it. Use jupyter, or spyder. Then check out [this](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml) wonderful page. Good luck. 
docker is your friend. Start from a python image then write the necessary instructions in the dockerfile
Did you know /r/learnpython is the right place to ask these types of questions? You do now ☺
Well, the biggest problem in those codebases is that you have an extremely long lifespan, often several rewrites and usually non of the initial devs are still there. Also, it's often a big, intertwined monolith. Having types enforced by the language is extremely helpful.
One would kinda hope OP tried the code...
Ah okay, sorry. I didn’t know it existed
Me either. Funny thing, I think Rust makes the interpretation of pointers a bit clearer. Python lacks pointers so it's an opaque operation most programmers don't have to consider when developing. I think they're an important tool to know to avoid bloat.
I thiiiiink you are talking about what program to use. VSCode is lightweight and has autocompletion so its fast and efficient. If you're talking hardware, well for Python you'll need i9, minimum 32gb TripleDoubleDDRam and a 2TB HDD (SSD won't have the stability of gyroscopic inertia like HDD).
Interesting. I suspect I am on the opposite side of the spectrum from many Python users, but I try to avoid superfluous dependancies because of some unrelated restrictions at work. But, those do look interesting even if I do just copy that code too (no better than copying the recipes)
No problemo... I guessed as much, which is why I mentioned it

Yeah, the switch to python 3 wasn't just about putting brackets around print. It's a very meaningful change.
Man you sound like you’re still stuck in 2010 when it comes to JavaScript. You should see everything the language is producing now. 
Thats true, maybe "natural language processing" is an exception.
I do wish Python had a little better typing support. "a: int" is a little odd when everything else uses "int a", although it's not too bad. But it would let you do stuff like "int a:whatever", having both a type, and whatever other unkown purpose they imagine someone might ever want to annotate a variable with. And everything mypy does should probably be in the stdlib. I kinda wish they had accepted that one PEP for making it easy to write preprocessors. A bunch random experimental variants doesn't sound that bad, but maybe they were afraid of repeating what happened with CoffeeScript.
The one nice thing about COBOL still existing is that it reminds us that software doesn't have to be throwaway garbage. It's kind of a depressing thought to think about throwing away and rewriting similar apps every ten years, although there's plenty of perfectly good apps I'd be perfectly happy to see tossed and replaced, like KiCad.
The wealth of third party libraries, and the ease with which one can create, audit, and share them, is one of the benefits of python as a language and ecosystem. You can tear my PyPI access out of my cold, dead hands (although I agree that installing extra libraries for a single piece of functionality ought to be avoided). That said, I'm glad our standard library is strong enough that we don't have to go all leftPad like javascript; python's a good middle ground.
Well, take the first rule of linux kernel development: never break user space. You're sort of trading off the conceptual purity of tidying up for turning scripts using /usr/bin/python into risks (Will it run on python 3? I dunno, but your computer's gonna try it anyway) and that's a bit of a hard sell outside of something bleeding edge like Arch. It's not backward compatible either but the safer route is what RHEL is trying: get rid of "python" altogether and if you want python2 or python3 that is what you called.
Starting to wonder why I’m subscribed here since my opinion is that Python is a joke for serious software and is almost as bad as JavaScript is in terms of safety. It’s just FAR too easy to do something INCREDIBLY destructive without even realizing it. It’s scary to me that the two worst/unsafe languages are also the most popular.
Hard to believe you're home brewing something better than tensorflow or pytorch.
Thanks for the resource and concepts I'll start off slow.
Thanks for the step-by-step!
Gonna keep scikit in mind, thank you.
It's not so much evaluating the NN, but all the other things like searching the game tree, that's got to be concurrent &amp; fast.
That's actually kind of perfect.
Also how do they know they're not snake enthusiasts?
Not unless it also measures how many competent developers know it also... Furthermore if you only apply to jobs based on the language you know you're severely limiting yourself anyway
Javascript is the second *worst* language for any program. It just so happens that browsers only support one language.
Old article
I don't know the game, but if it outputs some particular sounds during a game over sequence you might consider pushing the audio through an fft and trying to fuzzy match on a sequence of frequencies appearing. I once wrote something to detect DTMF tones (the tones made pressing phone keys) and it was far easier than I originally imagined
There are things like pyinstaller and cxfreeze. How you distribute a python program kinda depends on your target audience. For example, if you're targeting Linux everyone has a python interpreter already so its easier to distribute your program. Take a look at Calibre, the ebook manager. It's a fairly complex program written in python and distributed just like many programs written in something like C or VB....namely, you download an installer and run it and it adds entries to the Start Menu (in Windows), etc.
You'll probably pick up the basics of programming and Python pretty easily.
Getting lots of data from an API, storing it in a file and then using Excel for the analysis. First time I've used any programming language - and it all worked for the first time this evening. Has rate limiting and everything.
Have you seen this? I found this really helpful. https://youtu.be/FB0TY51Hid0 Also taking a course on Blender is the only way I was able to use it. I tried with YouTube tutorials for years but they miss so many of the building blocks of knowledge. There is a course on udemy for ten dollars is highly recommend.
In the setup.py it says it's compatible with 2.7 and 3.2-3.5. However, those easily get outdated. The unit tests look like they're designed to run on 2.7 and 3.4-3.7. It's a handful of commands to check that yourself (clone, run tox). Future updates of python are unlikely to break compatibility, given the ballache they've had between 2 and 3.
Fair enough. I've never had to do 2.7 to 3 migration for a "real" app, so I'm sure it's more difficult than I'm imagining.
Please note!!! This is *kindly asked* but not *strictly enforced*. If you, the community, want to see less homework help please be proactive and politely refer such questions to /r/learnpython!
May I ask what you mean “pushing the audio through an fft”? Unfamiliar with “fft” and fuzzy matching. I’ve always wanted to try and work with my computer’s audio output with Python directly. I didn’t know where to begin, and lacked the base understanding to try and formulate some Google queries to learn more... 
Plenty of people comment and don't vote.
Python is great for all the reason you mentioned and was my go to language for most any project but I've recently shifted to Golang. It's _almost_ as fast to get off the ground as python but benefits from the stability and debugging ease if strongly typed languages. Also write once and compile to native cos for any OS is a godsend.
JS is popular because it runs in the browser and nothing else does. People running it in node are insane.
Architecture is my biggest struggle in c++ right now. Trying to not have two or moreclasses co-depend on each other. I can understand how a lot of things in c++ works, it's just trying to keep OOP clean.
searched for a while and found this page about the approach. explains far better than I can... https://willdrevo.com/fingerprinting-and-audio-recognition-with-python/
It looks like feedparser is actively maintianed, with updates in the last month, and assurances here: https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser/issues/155
Wow thats overkill.
Imagine what world could be if we ended up with python as standard scripting language of the web instead.
A well-deserved honor. I consider it the finest language currently in common use.
If somebody reads this and knows about a piece of software that can filter out job listings by quality, please forward it to me.

i do both, but except for math/stats in python, i find modern perl much nicer to layout and read. ppl criticise perl for being cryptic , but that's bc it is often used for parsing complex strings ... which is ugly in any language. perl is what i use as my glue language.
None of my uni classes ever even mentioned python lol, we went from C -&gt; C++ -&gt; ASM -&gt; Java 
Yes the community edition is free, and open source. I do not know if it supports different languages though, I only use the English version of software even if it's available in my native language.

Hi there, this post has been removed as it is not directly related to the Python programming language. It might be more topical on /r/programming, /r/coding, or /r/technology. Cheers, /r/Python mods
Yeah definitely. VS Code is absolutely amazing for Javascript dev, and one of the major reasons I've been using JS over python more and more lately. VS Code is still very good for Python too though. So I'd definitely recommend giving it a shot if your still looking for an editor/IDE
Your idea sounds really interesting. Have you thought making a (simple) blog? You can post your snippets, discuss your ideas/intent and solicit feedback? Post links here so people can follow you? A story about a story?
am I going crosseyed -- I can't see Go on the list. 
Woooooooo
It was intended as a compliment. I don't know why people misunderstand this so much. Personally, I've been wanting to learn Rust, but Python is so easy to do anything with, that in the end I just end up writing the thing in Python just to finish quickly.
Cython is write in modified python, compile to C and wrap the result in python
I'm building an interactive discord bot. 
&gt; "a: int" is a little odd when everything else uses "int a" you mean like Kotlin https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/basic-syntax.html and Scala? https://www.tutorialspoint.com/scala/scala_variables.htm
Good luck man, it sounds interesting. I’ve been trying to make a text based dungeon crawler but trying to keep track of the player location is kicking my ass
The lack of pointer use in Python threw me for a few loops when indexing arrays ... I mean lists. It’s nice to have high level, but you’re taking it on faith that things are managed well. 
[https://github.com/brython-dev/brython](https://github.com/brython-dev/brython)
Ugh. I use it at work. It's fine. I don't dislike it. I even like it. I like it, a lot. But, every day I feel like I'd still rather be writing Ruby.
Conda masterrace
I think it's important that newbies enjoy the rewards of easily creating programs first, so that they are motivated to learn the underlying fundamentals in a language like C.
Don't know why but above link is broken, try [this one]https://opensource.com/article/19/1/getting-started-pelican
Thanks for the heads-up!
Think about this one. It really depends on the variables within the context of the situation.
&gt;Starting to wonder why I’m subscribed here since my opinion is that &gt;Python is a joke for serious software How do you reconcile your opinion given that Instagram, Google, Dropbox, Netflix, Facebook, Paypal, etc. are using Python for serious software? &gt; and is almost as bad as JavaScript is in terms of safety. The big secret is... there's nothing to be afraid of. &gt; It’s just FAR too easy to do something INCREDIBLY destructive without &gt;even realizing it. What's "incredibly destructive"? I mean, we could say that without significant white space it's far too easy to do something incredibly destructive without even realizing it. In fact, in his "Why Python is awesome" talk, Raymond Hettinger talks about an error in cascading if statements in C that passed through human code review and a linter and ended up costing a company one million dollars. &gt;It’s scary to me that the two worst/unsafe languages are also the most &gt;popular. Again, there's nothing to be afraid of. You've been raised to believe in demons and monsters and boogeymen under the bed, but they're not real. The truth shall set you free. You're never going to try to pass "iguana" into your square root function. You're just not. Throw away your static typing... you have nothing to lose but your chains! Hear the good news and then join us in the land of freedom! https://vimeo.com/74354480
&gt; People running it in node are insane Well, if they're not, after they discover that there are 759,030 packages in the npm package manager (seriously!) yet all but ten do the same thing (slight exaggeration) they go insane.
In some cases, no... like javascript (web developers don't really have a choice). But in this case, no one is forcing Python on people. People are using it because it is indeed better. 
It's called "extrapolation" and is indeed how statistics works. Remember the saying: "Everyone you meet at PyCon is either a web developer or a data scientist". Don't try to fib about statistics in a Python subreddit. 
Think of it like hardware. Nowadays, even an entry-level PC is fast enough to do everything the average person does and thus you can use it a long time without considering an upgrade. But in the earlier days, new CPUs tended to run twice as fast as their predecessors and hence upgrading was more necessary and more useful. COBOL was from the early days of programming though. Continuing to use COBOL today is like still recording television programs on a VCR or using a video camera that takes full-size Super VHS tapes. 
"When the pupil is ready, the teacher will come." When the programmer is ready, Python will be there waiting.
&gt;JavaScript is great. It's been factually demonstrated by people with PhDs over and over that Javascript is not great. That's an extraordinary claim requiring extraordinary evidence. This one photo is all the evidence you should need... https://medium.com/javascript-non-grata/the-top-10-things-wrong-with-javascript-58f440d6b3d8 There are entire websites dedicated to documenting all of the quirks and issues with javascript: https://wtfjs.com/ http://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/ https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/182416/A-Collection-of-JavaScript-Gotchas http://www.javascriptgotchas.com/gotchas/common-javascript-errors-and-mistakes.html
Don't say it is indeed better like it's supposed to be better than every language to exist.
I also enjoy Perl for regex occasionally.
Are there any others? I thought the only alternative was bundling some requests and lxml/bs4, (a.k.a. building your own). Seriously I'd love to try other angles, web scraping is fun. I'm just a casual user but imo the cool thing about Scrapy is that provides structure and workflow (duh.. it's a framework), you just code the spiders with the right selectors and some logic to build the items and it's done, output will be CSV or XML. You can also create an item pipeline and push to a database or perform some computation. Configuration is flexible and powerful, you can switch the user agent, specify number of threads, use auto throttling, how many times to retry failed URLs. I learned from the official docs and their video series on YouTube.
&gt; In my Eclipse/Java environment I simply hit ctrl+space and a list pops up. As Raymond Hettinger notes, Python users can write Python code on the back of a napkin. You cannot do that with Java. You NEED that Eclipse/Java environment because Java is filled with FactoryFactoryFactoryBeans. In Python, we can actually remember the names of methods. And there sure as heck is code completion in Pycharm and every other Python IDE, so I don't know what you're talking about. https://web.archive.org/web/20150412231018/http://www.javafind.net/gate.jsp?q=/library/36/java6_full_apidocs/com/sun/java/swing/plaf/nimbus/InternalFrameInternalFrameTitlePaneInternalFrameTitlePaneMaximizeButtonPainter.html https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/2.5.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/config/SimpleBeanFactoryAwareAspectInstanceFactory.html
More like cringe train.
&gt; You can write plenty large scale stuff in Python, but Enterprise is just a &gt;completely different thing. It's not. That's a myth Java programmers spread. Python is in use at banks, Netflix, Paypal, Dropbox, YouTube, Google, NASA, Instagram, etc. Here, read this to become un-brainwashed: [10 Myths of Enterprise Python](https://www.paypal-engineering.com/2014/12/10/10-myths-of-enterprise-python/) Pay particular attention to this part of the essay from the Paypal Engineers' Blog: &gt;Myth #10: Python is not for big projects &gt; &gt;Myth #7 discussed running Python projects at scale, but what about &gt;developing Python projects at scale? As mentioned in Myth #9, most &gt;Python projects tend not to be people-hungry. while Instagram reached &gt;hundreds of millions of hits a day at the time of their billion dollar &gt;acquisition, the whole company was still only a group of a dozen or so &gt;people. Dropbox in 2011 only had 70 engineers, and other teams were &gt;similarly lean. So, can Python scale to large teams? &gt; &gt;Bank of America actually has over 5,000 Python developers, with over 10 &gt;million lines of Python in one project alone. JP Morgan underwent a &gt;similar transformation. YouTube also has engineers in the thousands and &gt;lines of code in the millions. Big products and big teams use Python every &gt;day, and while it has excellent modularity and packaging characteristics, &gt;beyond a certain point much of the general development scaling advice &gt;stays the same. Tooling, strong conventions, and code review are what &gt;make big projects a manageable reality. &gt; &gt;Luckily, Python starts with a good baseline on those fronts as well. We &gt;use PyFlakes and other tools to perform static analysis of Python code &gt;before it gets checked in, as well as adhering to PEP8, Python’s &gt;language-wide base style guide. &gt; &gt;Finally, it should be noted that, in addition to the scheduling speedups &gt;mentioned in Myth #6 and #7, projects using Python generally require &gt;fewer developers, as well. Our most common success story starts with a &gt;Java or C++ project slated to take a team of 3-5 developers somewhere &gt;between 2-6 months, and ends with a single motivated developer &gt;completing the project in 2-6 weeks (or hours, for that matter). &gt; &gt;A miracle for some, but a fact of modern development, and often a &gt;necessity for a competitive business.
It isn't. It absolutely isn't. No one ever passes "iguana" into the square root function. Lots of studies have been done showing that typing just doesn't make any discernible difference. Bank Of America has over 5,000 Python developers and one project alone has over 10 million lines of Python code. If they're not yearning for static typing, doesn't that put the lie to this myth?
&gt; "a: int" is a little odd when everything else uses "int a" No, in the beginning there was Algol and all of its descendants (Pascal, Ada, etc.). And they used Var a : Integer; b : Real; c: String; It's this "int a" stuff that's odd, as odd as Reverse Polish Notation. 
And Pascal, and Algol, and Ada, and Modula-2, and Go, and Oxygene, and Delphi, and....
You're reminding me of the time I searched for "genetic programming Python" on the Google Play Store and came up with an app that let you input the colors of ball pythons and find out the odds for what the babies would look like. :-)
It's axiomatic. No one says "I love this... BUT I WILL NOT SEARCH FOR IT". It's like asking if ticket sales reflect movie popularity. 
&gt; Who cares how popular a language is? People whose languages are unpopular. Spend time in their groups and you'll see them obsessed with telling themselves how popular they are, rallying all of their fellow true believers to vote in a poll, tearing apart any metric that doesn't rank their language as high as they'd like, etc. &gt; As long as you can hire developers / get hired for know it, whatever. Said groups even dispute this. If you were to say that in their midst, they'd say that REAL programmers can work for themselves so if you're complaining you can't find a job using their favorite language you're not a real programmer (have actually been told this more than once). Oh, and the fact that there are no job listings for their language is a GOOD thing. All of those Java job listings mean that no one can find a Java developer but the lack of listings for their language means that the jobs are filled immediately. Again, have actually gotten this response a certain language's official forum. And this is from the product manager for Delphi (modern Pascal): "I sincerely believe that Delphi has had more of an impact on business than Python ever has." He's also said he doesn't agree that the .NET ecosystem is bigger than the Delphi ecosystem. If you hung around with the fanatics for obscure languages your mind would be blown, e.g. Haskell folks HATING Guido forever for a comment he made many years ago about tail-call recursion. Just bringing up his name on their mailing list gets comments like "Is it April Fool's Day already?" :-( 
&gt;Furthermore if you only apply to jobs based on the language you know I don't have a medical degree - should I apply to be a brain surgeon? Sorry, every job lists how many years of experience you should have with a language and candidates who don't have it are screened out by software that processes resume submissions. I mean, Guido is a genius, but why would you hire him to develop a massive Perl project?
Because this: \&gt; \["1","2","3","4"\].map(parseInt) &amp;#x200B;
Ahh mb shoulda looked harder, this is relieving thanks!
Other bad news, python parallelization is in need of an overhaul.
What I meant by different languages was different "programing" languages.
Not necessarily, because there are quite a number of reasons why someone would search for something - the most obvious example to me being perhaps a language generates more questions that need to be searched for online than another that isn't related to popularity, but rather complexity or some other factor
I believe this line surfaced here before the rise of Tensorflow. I've been following Python since 2012 and that's probably about the time I saw it mentioned here. The explanation was along the lines of: Person A says they prefer Matlab for numerical analysis, but Python is their second choice. Person B says they prefer R for the job, but Python is their favorite choice. Person A says they prefer Java for web development, but Python is their second choice. Person B says they prefer Ruby, but their next pick would be Python. It's true that since that time we've seen Python become the most likely number one choice in a few areas. The point remains that it is very generally useful and has little or no obvious flaws. It's not that it does one thing great (PHP, C++, etc.), but that it does many things well. The "jack of all trades" line was originally part of a longer ditty that went: Jack of all trades, master of none Often is better Than master of one 
Does anyone know how Larry Wall is holding up? Especially since he once predicted that Python would go the way of COBOL (and which is now happening to Perl instead)?
Actually python is not mess as JS at all. You won't see insane type conversions (e.g : "1"+2, \[\]+{},...). It has proper integer type and they added optional static typing like Typescript(e.g Mypy) . Sure you won't get safety of something like Haskell, or even functional dynamic language like Clojure. 
Newish to python, going to create a to do list app that I can update and receive alerts from through SMS
But..but some manager in my company says “it’s not in our tech stack....”
Huh ?
That's so weird. These people are weird.
holy fuck
I could probably make that with some time. I imagine that there are a lot of commonalities amongst bad job listings. So you could probably build a model, sort of like spam filtering.
One of the nice things about Python is that you can simply copy and paste the statements into the Python interpreter, one at a time, and watch what happens. You can play around with it, print out the intermediate results, change some of the values of the variables, and try it several times with variations, doing different simple experiments until you understand how it works. But, in your code sample above, the variable 'i' is not assigned a value anywhere. Probably the line "h = ..." is meant to be within some kind of a loop.
&gt; but benefits from the stability and debugging ease if strongly typed &gt;languages. First - Python IS a strongly typed language. It is also dynamically typed. Second, coming from twenty years of static language programming, you're in for a sad surprise. :-( You've been sold a bill of goods -static typing doesn't catch any meaningful errors. I'm 46 and been coding since sixth grade and have never once passed "iguana" into a square root function. I have spent lots of time fighting with compilers that refuse to compile something that I, the human, know will work. Last evening I was playing around with Free Pascal compiler and tried this: Var n : Integer; Function test(x: Integer): Integer; Var y : integer; Begin y := x + 1; End; Begin n := test(3); WriteLn(n); End. The compiler issued a warning that it didn't seem that the function returned a value (no "seem" about it; it doesn't) and gave me a hint that variable y never seems to be used. However, it compiled and gave me a green "success" message. The output, of course, is gibberish. Yay static typing! No better warnings/hints than Python and the Python code assigns "none" when something references the value of a function with no return value. Free Pascal returned "4". Thinking it was returning the last integer assignment (which doesn't seem to be a documented feature) I made the last statement in the function assign a string. Now it returns "0". I'll choose the efficiency of Python any day now over vast scaffolding of types, interfaces, generics, etc. - which all exist to get around static typing and try to make the language more dynamic, simulate duck typing, etc. 
True. So many things we could probably make, so little time. 
Yes, it's producing over 700,000 libraries in npm, most of which do the same thing! 
That's a myth; it isn't observed in reality. And Haskell programmers (also not observed in reality) will tell you that C++ and Java aren't "really" statically typed anyway.
What is something destructive that you can do in JS and how is it incredibly destructive when compared with the mess you can make of a low level language? I don't understand.
Thanks for the tip. I will have to try it. I am a Java guy and was staring at this for awhile before giving up.

Yeah! I was also super excited when I first saw this library! The only thing I wonder about is the development speed of coconut, there's not so much new commit on their repo :/
Why not use a language designed for interactive fiction like inform? 
What's wrong with `multiprocessing`?
GIL
&gt; "I sincerely believe that Delphi has had more of an impact on business than Python ever has." He's not wrong. The amount of GUIs in legacy applications written with Embarcadero/Borland's Delphi for Windows is astounding. The .NET ecosystem is a galaxy larger, though.
GIL does not apply to `multiprocessing`. GIL locks against any single interpreter having more than one real working thread. `multiprocessing` spins up more than one interpreter.
Because you're passing a function in that takes multiple parameters. You completely ignoring function signatures is not evidence that JS is a mess. Issues around JS's handling of type coercion, on the other hand (0 == [])...
It sucks if you actually need to do real parallelization across multiple nodes of a super computer. 
 [1, NaN, NaN, NaN] What?! WHY?
I am experienced with Python and want to start ML but without libraries. Anyone know a place to learn this?
the entire point of black is that it's a non-configurable style guide this defeats the point of such a program imo
Or just specify your versions. I mean it’s what they need and if python or a dependency goes and changes something, your tests should catch it. It’s easy to say, but what’s the public API version?
Jarvis is trying his best
How do you change the install path? I get the same error with this. 
PySimpleGui is pretty great. Biggest strength has to be the documentation, which is virtually non-existent in counterpart libraries. Easily one of the most usable and feature-rich gui tools. My biggest gripe: I wish the code was organized as a package rather than one big module, especially considering the amount of features it holds. Would love to contribute, just a bit too hard on the eyes.
That's just poor understanding of the language
\&gt;"Issues around JS's handling of type coercion, on the other hand (0 == \[\])..." It's definition of mess. It's definition of being bad designed. \&gt; "You completely ignoring function signatures is not evidence that JS is a mess." No. It's evidence of being mess. \&gt; "Because you're passing a function in that takes multiple parameters." parseInt works for single parameters and it's function. Why someone should think It has more job than getting string and convert it to Int? and map method getting a function and map it to sequence. Again It's definition mess. 
In all fairness Python has its fair share of WATs. I don't think syntax alone is what makes Python nice. What makes JS great is the fact you don't need to care about threads and it has async built in from the start. All js engines I tried are considerably faster than cpython for most things. What makes it suck is that it doesn't have a standard library and the ecosystem is so retarded that every function is an npm module. On the other hand you can write frontend, backend and mobile with just JS. Python has a great std library, packages are nice, pip is great. But cpython is pretty slow, and async is only a new thing. There is no future in sight where cpython and pypy will merge. It also sucks that Python still has half of the community stuck on the old version and half on the new version. 
Because .map() also passes the index to the parseInt function where it's expecting rarix. So it's essentially [parseInt("1", 0), parseInt("2", 1), parseInt("3", 2)]
By this logic every language is fine, It's problem of programmers don't understand them. 
R has had a pretty solid jump. It competes for projects where I'm at with python. I've used both and I find in the stats/data science arena R is better for standard everyday analysis and Python is good for specialized machine learning stuff. Im no expert but having 7 different, basically identical data types (arrays, numpy arrays, pandas dataframe) makes data analysis frustrating. R having everything be a vector or dataframe with knitr makes R a primary choice for data analysis in my opinion.
You think JS has suffered more from backward compatibility than Python ?
Ok... Run your career that way if you choose. If you're applying via blind applications through the company portal hoping to not get screened out by the filters you've already lost.
I love his t-shirts
GIL applies to multiple threads, nor multiple processes right? 
rewrite it in C/C++
&gt; parseInt works for single parameters and it's function. It has default parameters. Lots of languages do (C++, python, lisp, etc). You don't always have to pass all of the parameters to a function, this is common across many languages. The default parameter for base (the second parameter to parseInt) is 10, because most people are going to use this. &gt;and map method getting a function and map it to sequence Yeah, and three parameters are passed into that function. The current element, the index of the current element, and the entire array. In the example you used, the index gets passed into parseInt, and that index happens to be one less than the number you're using. This guarantees the number is not valid in that base. This isn't just you misunderstanding parseInt, you completely misunderstand how map works as well.
You should take a look to mathematical books. Most of tutorials for ML in Youtube or medium are by whom who don't understand It. For neural networks this [book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) is very good. For implementation of algorithms It just use numpy for matrix manipulation. For machine learning take a look [Andrew Ng course on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). 
Data Science from Scratch by Joel Grus is the one that springs to mind.
don´t do it in python, use a compiled programming language
I can tell you pretty well that static typing is very much appreciated in reality
A. it does not work for large data which needs to be shared between processes scenario (you end up replicating the data across workers and running out of memory) B. processes communicate via serialization which is slower and have additional failure modes (e.g objects need to be serializable) C. exceptions donot propagate and have (or at least had) a tendency to hang the whole process

Apart from the fact that python is not in any way part of the linux kernel, that is another abstract argument. Are you talking about python scripts written by the user? It shouldn't be that hard to either migrate or explicitly invoke python2 in that case.

bad news is now there's more competition for python jobs, which may also result in downwards pressure on wages. 
I don't know of any - maybe someone else does. But at least the way I use Python for research, this feels to me a bit like asking if John Deere has plans on significantly speeding up their harvesters - it's not really what they're for. There are other options for speeding up Python (such as just in time compilation, or cython etc as you mentioned), but a Python-style, interpreted language will inherently never be fast compared to a compiled language without losing all of the cool things interpreted languages can do. What we can do instead is use "Python as glue" to put pieces of Fortran and/or C codes together on supercomputers and to do pre- and postprocessing of data. It's really good at what it does, and Fortran and C are really good at being fast. Speeding up Python won't make any difference since we're spending the vast majority of our millions of CPU hours in the C and Fortran routines, not on the Python.
What are you running that needs to be sped up? Numpy and many other libraries are written in C. Most of the work is done in C.
Been writing code for my own hanging plotter. Wanted to build from ground up. Importing gcode is challenging.
I'm sorry I can't answer your questions since I've never used curses, but I wanted to say that this is awesome - keep up the good work! Now that I'm thinking about it though, I think NetHack is open source. I have no idea what that codebase looks like though, so it may be less than helpful if you're looking for best practices.
I just read the general answer about this sort of question in my .NET textbook of all places... Unlike languages like C# and C++ that are strongly-typed, meaning that when data memory gets allocated at some binary address, and the intermediate code was generated by the CLR compiler (C#), then its corresponding registry cannot have its data-type muted. This is a good thing if you want a program to be fast. On the other hand if you're using the Python interpreter, it's going to have your program wait until the last second before it infers types. I'm no expert, but one reason Python seems "less efficent" than C is because failing to pre-allocate memory until you absolutely have to makes me think that the program has to reserve a little bit more heap memory than C has to since it should logically be able to deal with any case that might show up for a given assignment statement, be the object a dictionary, a list of some boolean and floats, a generator, etc. In other words, more registry changing should correspond to more time spent compiling. 
And machine learning's already slow enough
Why dont you suggest this on the python-ideas mailing list?
Converting to an executable doesn't speed up anything unless you're transcompiling via something like Nuitka; the only reason things like PyInstaller might result in a noticeable speed boost is if your PYTHONPATH is extremely cluttered. To the main question, there are _always_ plans to improve Python execution speed, and they're constantly being incorporated into new Python versions. In the CPython reference interpreter a lot of that involves rewriting hot spots in C, but even there are fundamental limitations at the boundaries where Python code interacts with the C ABI under the hood. So if you're already using C on all your hot paths and avoiding lots of interconversion -- which can happen easily in poorly optimized numpy code, for instance -- then you can't expect or hope that it gets much faster. If your hot paths are all in pure Python you can often get an immediate speed boost by simply switching the interpreter from CPython to PyPy, so long as you're only using compatible libraries that are ideally also pure Python. That switches to an entirely different execution model, one which is often faster, though there are trade offs if you're using a lot of things already implemented in C.
Don't you mean vectors :)
&gt;The biggest problem of python is its speed of execution Debatable. &amp;#x200B; &gt;even R; python is considered as a slower language. Suggesting that R is generally faster than CPython is a ridiculous claim. &amp;#x200B; &gt;Any running projects regarding this? PyPy
I use it in an internal service served behind nginx without issue. It's quite well thought out and the project has good attention to quality. A nice advantage compared to other frameworks/libs is that it contains both an HTTP server and client which makes some things like proxying a response quite easy. 
Oh and it also does websockets out of the box. All in all it would still be nice to use even if it wasn't using asyncio. If you like/need asyncio then that's an obvious plus as well. 
pay what you want above 12 dollars. If you were rich you could totally screw with people and just put in a $500 dollar purchase in early.
You can always try numba, http://numba.pydata.org, I had some good (and sometimes bad) results
The main CPython implementation occasionally gets some optimizations, but I don't expect it to get much faster. The Python implementation you want for speed is [PyPy](https://pypy.org/). It uses a Just-In-Time compiler, like what you'd expect from the JVM or v8. Its Python compatibility is said to be pretty good these days. Funding for PyPy development has been sporadic, but they've had some sponsors that have allowed some good work.
I use it to collect a few millions of events coming over post and get.... Worked fine for me thus far. 
&gt;so long as you're only using compatible libraries that are ideally also pure Python. PyPy also does well interfacing with libraries that use [CFFI](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/goals.html). It avoids some of the problems PyPy has with the CPython API, and packages that use CFFI are usable under both CPython and PyPy.
Sure, they're just not going to get any faster than running the same path on CPython... the "ideally" is because it's the pure Python sections where the JIT can give a speed boost.
You are right: `quit` doesn't end the program. It is there because `TextMenu.menuitems` have to be tuples of (description, option, function): ("Exit", "E", quit) in the example. The exit condition of the `while` loop in `TextMenu.show()` is the option "E". It is always the option of the last menu item. `quit` (or whatever you name the function of the last menu item) provides an explicit way to... well... quit. You can check for conditions, print a status report, save settings or just say Goodbye to your user.
I was mostly referrimg to bs4. I tried out both bs4 and Scrapy doing extremely simple stuff. For the very simple tasks I tried I felt that Scrapy was a bit big and clunky. But depending on the use case I can understand your point that a proper framework is more useful.
[DOTADIW](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well) Applies more to the programs you write vs the utility of a given language, but I though it a relevant response to your ditty. Python is my second favorite language :)

Thank you Mr
Yeah, I stumbled upon masonite in the past and the major drawbacks for me are that there is too much magic going on there (especially with the models and migrations), and it seems to be doing exactly what Django is doing, but with another api and terminology. It does not seem to bring anything new to the table.
Nonfree software is usually none of my business (and you won't find technical tools in the free software area for that), but here's an idea, provided it's applicable to what you're doing: Don't try to protect the program itself, that's only executed locally and can be circumvented without you noticing. Try to protect what you're producing / exchanging. If you're providing any hosted service, that's obvious and easy (you'd have paid accounts), but it also works with files by signing produced files with a key bound to the sold license. If it's a video encoder and someone uses it to publish videos, whoever bought the pirated copy and hands it out would have their license identify visible in public files (would probably not be a publicly visible name in that case, but you'd have their contact details). If it's CAD software, that'd have the licensee's name visible in CAD files, and eg. a factory would see that the files they're sent were not produced by their customer, and *their* software (if unaltered) could refuse to print data created by (easy to distribute because no dongling needed) a demo version of your software. Thus the solution to the social problem of license violation can be addressed by social means aided by technical ones, but does not push awkward copy-protection solutions into the technical domain. Applying this principle might be more difficult with less exchange between the programs - to progress there I'd need to know a little about what your software does.
Yes, but only a very simple one. Essentially I want the program to do the following: - take a coordinate range from a user based on a map interface. - download any open source dem data from the USGS inside those coordinates - download satellite images to match - output the data as 3d geometry and matching texture sets (alembic format for the geometry, tiff format for the textures). There's some other functionality I'd like to add in there, but basically the UI would only need to be able to display the dem vector data - which I think matplotlib can handle - and display the 3d geometry after that.
I like your explanation. Thanks!
Honestly if speed is of code is a concern you are using the wrong language!!!! I’m not sure why people have trouble with this concept. To look at it another way, lately the only language I’ve been using is Python. Why? Simple for the trivial stuff I’ve been working on Pythons advantages out weigh the execution speed penalties. The closest thing to a “speedy” python replacement is Apples Swift in my opinion. Right from the beginning it was designed to have a REPL and to be compiled effciently. No language is perfect but Swift in my estimation is the closest to the writing productivity of Python. So there are alternatives if you want to consider them. In any event I think you totally mis the point of Python. It has always been focused on developer efficiency not execution efficiency. In that regard it is unmatched as a general purpose language. 
Really really depends on what `X` and `y` are. And how descriptive `y` name is. And whether I’m importing more stuff from `y`. However, when I write my own `X` i think of it as a singleton object (what it really is) and name `y` accordingly - short names making sense only in `X.y` form (like `clipboard.get()`) Exception: general unrelated tools modules. Then the opposite is true: short name for `X` and long descriptive name for `y`.
Python is just a low barrier to entry similar to php. I think the most important thing these days is community and a powerful type system, and Python only really suits me in one of those areas
For my first project I designed a fully functional consciousness with a neural network. If that gives you ideas.
All techniques you describe only allow for linear speed ups, 2x, 4x, 10x, I hardly doubt 20x. If you want to speed up 99% of python programs what you need to do is to better educate most programmers into algorithmic optimization. There is where big gains can be achieved. Using the right data structures and algorithms can yield enormous speed ups, much beyond what any linear optimization can provide.
THERE ARE DOZENS OF ~~US~~ THEM
What's your take on Julia?
&gt; that is another abstract argument. You may have to just deal with that. "Why should things be backward compatible" is design principle stuff.
Is it an off-the-shelf engine, or did you write it yourself?
&gt; that is another abstract argument. You may have to just deal with that. "Why should things be backward compatible" is design principle stuff. The reason to bring up the linux kernel is that being backwards compatible is one of their design principles.
Alpha Zero is different to TensorFlow. I can see the appeal of Go, it is designed to be highly concurrent, so it can probably do better in a multi-CPU environment. Perhaps Go is better at feeding the GPU with sufficient data. Are you using a GPU?
Python is just the wrapper over blazingly fast libraries written in something like C, Fortran or Cuda C (or even compiled versions of Python, like CPython). So you have a simple, seamless experience in Python. 
I am building a forum for bloggers with Django and bootstrap. 
Seems like PHP is really fading away. Where the web is going i predict the decline will further speed up in coming years.
Very much the same as what happened with JavaScript, but with a better standard library and worse dependency management.
It may be a design principle, and they may have, for whatever reason, adapted it from the linux kernel, but debian still breaks a lot of stuff with every version: [https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/release-notes/ch-information.en.html](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/release-notes/ch-information.en.html) I'm just saying that I've yet to see an example of a specific problem given that they tell the user/admin: python3 is default, so make sure to invoke python2 for legacy scripts.
I prefer the second form, as it makes it easier to see the lineage of things. In case X is areallyandcumbersomelongnamethatnoonewantstotypeoutmorethanonce, it's perfectly Pythonic to shorten the name during import import areallyandcumbersomelongnamethatnoonewantstotypeoutmorethanonce as short

There are always plans to speed up cpython, but due to the highly dynamic nature of python and the desire not to break existing code, there are no large gains to be made (so far!). Parts of python 3 usually get faster every release. Things like [pypy](https://pypy.org) try to be much faster but there are limitations.
Learn serious optimization like gradient descent, math(matrixes), numpy(you still will need lib). Then just read some books.
Black Hat Python is fairly decent for learning about it - there are a few courses on udemy around the $10 range as well. I'd get comfortable in Python first, as BHP has some slightly odd ways of doing things that won't be obvious if you're new to it, but it's worth dipping in and out of. (Not sure on the skill tree aspect, but they'll give you a base of terminology and ideas about it.) Worth reading about OWASP vulnerabilities as well, for web apps.

Yeah I know you don’t understand. That was clear the moment you jumped to defend a toy language with dynamic typing.
Nope. It's fairly complex language. How many PL out there have metaclass or operator overloading? Yeah for most people using it just as scripting language for tensorflow It's very simple just because they use subset of It.

I personally wouldn’t consider an unpaid internship. If you have to travel to the location or incur any other expenses, you’re essentially losing money to help a company profit which his working backwards. The purpose of an internship is to gain experience and/or to potentially transition to a full time position. Is the value of what you will be learning at this internship greater than the compensation plus experience you will receive at any other company? Also, if you’re intentions are to potentially transition to a full time position, you will definitely be underpaid and overworked.

They should. If parent process don't pass environment variables, child cannot get them. There is no such thing as "exiting the sudo-mode". Sudo is the parent and you cannot just exit from parent juristiction and go back to the grandparent.

Only yesterday I was musing over an dead like summary or tldr for job posts. Strip out all the HR buzzwords and replace terms like "needs to be self organising" with "We don't have a defined process" Might experiment with it.
There's enough commonality between languages that experience with one would give you a leg up on another. Like being extremly component in Java would be beneficial if the job offer was c#, or Scala. Both are widely different to each other, but understanding the intricacies of Java would make it easier to learn either quickly.

By the way, what I wanna to do it that I have multiple scripts doing different things. A.py will flash my board automatically, B.py will set up my Linux host machine with all the dependencies. So I wrote another main script (C.py) to integrate both A and B. In script C.py, it will execute script A and B with the sudo priveleage too. For example, $ sudo python A.py, and $ sudo python B.py. So I execute script C.py like this: $ sudo python c.py. So I should execute the sudo -E when execute the script C right? $ sudo -E python C.py right? Thanks.

Well no shit. You need to know how map and parseInt work. 
Praising python over JS because of backwards compatibility is hilarious 
If you're looking for tips on writing fast code, read up on algorithms and data structures.
Of course! you should know all of these :)) [https://i.redd.it/rz3o1yibnc511.png](https://i.redd.it/rz3o1yibnc511.png)
Isn't that what spark and beam are for?

Wow I was asking for clarity and this is how you respond.. Im waiting for an example. Since you cant give one, I'll just assume you have no idea what you're saying. Js is a browser based scripting language. You arent going to fuck anything up with it. Also, you can easily use typescript if you are worried about types. 
... but I didn't say anything like that.
I'm interested in how it turns out! Very cool. You have the right approach
if all(trigger in description.lower() for trigger in \['rockstar', 'many hats'\]): description = '\\n'.join(\['Looking to hire Axl Rose', description\])
With scrapy, don't you have to write OOP code? With beautifulsoup and selenium, you can write non-OOP code.
Yes. Otherwise sudo will not pass its environment variables to the child. You can find more information in sudo manpage.
At least these are actual quirks of the language, not just a poor understanding of it like the other example. In real life though things like those hardly ever come into play, and if you're regularly dealing with them then JS is probably not the right tool for your use case. Like seriously, most of those are just quirks with how operators in JS work. Every language has it's quirks that you can exploit. 
I am making a social media Amazon Lex chatbot integrated into slack. I have integrated Reddit, Twitter and Instagram apis into my lambda function. I've had to make sure my code is efficient since the lambda will sen a unhandled error if it takes too long. Very interesting project, I'm wondering how I can expand on it.

The bulk of my work is ML now, and this has moved Python in front of Java/Scala as my main languages that I use.
\&gt; The biggest problem of python is its speed of execution, &amp;#x200B; According to who?
I don't know about that. But in this example specifically, it's the programmer's lack of knowledge.
There is no lib I use for every app. Nevertheless some interesting libs are: * Selenium (automated browsing) * BeautifulSoup4 (retrieve data of a html doc) * pickle (storing objects easily) * turtle (draw on a canvas) * random
thanks for your reply, i’ll be sure to look into your recommendations!
The first place to speed up your code is by choosing an appropriate algorithm. Google "big O analysis". You'll want to develop an intuition for some of these things, you don't need to have to be able to prove that bubble sort is O(n^2) or whatever. This has nothing to do with Python and is just a basic computer science topic. The next best thing is to use efficient data structures. Hashes (O(1) access) instead of linked lists (O(n) access) if you can, for instance. This is mostly just the above efficient algorithm thing from above, but applied to how you organize/access your data. But there are other aspects, like size constraints. This is also mostly not a Python-specific thing, although what data structures are natively available can make a difference in your choices. Only after you've got both of those as good as you can get them should you really consider other steps. And always remember: "Premature optimization is the root of all evil."
I'm a computational physics person, so the libraries I use will definitely reflect that - nevertheless, here are the most common ones I use: * \_\_future\_\_ lets me use Python 3 features while putting off changing everything for big projects * numpy and scipy have fast numerical routines similar to matlab functions and packages * numba gives me just-in-time compilation, which is super useful if I'm prototyping a numerical method in Python and need a little speedup * matplotlib gives me MATLAB style plotting * pandas is the go-to for Big Data stuff
I agree that JavaScript is a mess. For the last few years it has become incredibly siloed respective of the framework. Which is fine but then when you go to try and learn the framework you are forced to learn the new language nuances (“he while youbwrap your brain around context, state, functional stateless components here is a totally new way to set variables from an array/object that isn’t intuitive at all...but look how elegant that looks! New shiny shit!!!”). Recent example: Classes in React are now frowned upon (???) and now it’s all about hooks. Wtf. It’s exhausting for someone trying to hit deadlines and deliver on a weekly/monthly basis. Looking for a new frontend job? You’d better destructure that object the way all the cool kids are doing it or else...ewww go back to jQuery! Nobody gives a shit if you’ve built something that solves a business need it seems. I’ve been starving for something I can just rely on. This is where Python may save my career and where I may turn the corner soon. 
We need more micropython stuff here, keep them coming 👍
Creator of Masonite here. Version 2.0 did have a lot of magic going on with the global helpers and all that. Even using it personally i started to not like them at all. When you're building a framework so rapidly it's hard to see the long term effects of specific features. While developing 2.1 (released this past December) we removed a whole bunch of code related magic like the helpers, the parameter resolving (forcing annotation resolving so you see what classes are what now). The models are Active Record style models so they do perform a lot of things under the hood that you are used to explicitly doing (like manually setting columns as attributes and setting the column types) that Orator does for you. Totally get how some people wouldn't want that to happen. Can you explain how migrations are magic though? Or how they are more magic than Django migrations? Really want to get other peoples perspective on Masonite features so we can make it a better framework.
requests, for web interaction Not modules, but black, flake8, pylint for code quality. 
depending on OS, just check the hibernate status.
Just as a quick heads up: keep in mind that it's often best to avoid using libraries when they're not necessary. Where I work, we call this "introducing dependencies". Essentially, you want as much of your code to stand on it's own two feet as you can, that way someone else's change/fix doesn't end up breaking your code. When you do introduce a dependency, try to stick to well-known and widely used packages. Have fun exploring!
I'm a computational physics person too! I'm a recent immigrant from C++. I'm running into a small problem with scipy that no one in my dept seems to be able to help me with; scipy doesn't seem to have a fixed step ode solver, or at least, not one I can find. I can't use the GSL wrapper to access it's FS ODE solver, as it causes a headache on our HPC cluster, but the dynamic time stepper is impractically slow. Do you know of any fix? I'm close to giving up and spending my weekend writing my own, but I struggle to believe there isn't one out there
This is OS specific. It's actually quite hard to do right since your app could be backgrounded or minimised - in which case the screen is on but you might not want to be running.
Just call UPS. They can find the package based on your name and the address. 
Well that's not fun
Yes. Also, scraping their website is a great way to make them dislike you a whole lot, which doesn't sound like a good idea for someone who mails lots of things. 
Do you mean that the [Python interface to GSL](http://pygsl.sourceforge.net/README.html) doesn’t work?
Custom engine + cuDNN.
I found bs4 a pain to install on both Windows and Unix machines, I found lxml to perform better and easier to install
I would personally argue for C# over Java
Got it, thanks.
I use numpy in 99% of my work and pandas in 90%. I'd definitely vote for those two as the first two to learn.

I know about algorithms complexity analysis(O). Thank you for pointing on efficiency of data structures. Maybe my question is too general. I wanted to ask where I can read how python internal mechanisms work? For example today I read post on reddit where somebody asks why code in functions is executed faster than in row files, cause from first view there is more work to do when creating a function. I am sorry for not writing that in my question. Maybe you can point me on something after this. Thank you.
Ñú
Works on my machine, but not on the HPC. Which I find weird, as it's happily run GSL based C++ code before. I guess I'm looking for a pure python solution?
I'm a beginner, so take this with a grain of salt. Here's my two cents: * Indentation looks pretty extreme. I think the convention is four spaces. * Print statements on lines 86-88 could be condensed with several lines inside triple quotes. * If statement on line 116 could be condensed by putting extensions in a list
Thanks for exposing me to `all()` which I've never seen! I really need to learn more of the standard library.
&gt;Where I work, we call this "introducing dependencies". i think it's called that everywhere
Networking/Web =&gt; sockets, requests, flask, gunicorn Gui =&gt; pyside (though I suggest taking the web-gui route) &amp;#x200B;
requests+bs4 is a great combo for scraping projects
You can iterate over sets, can't you? So why don't you use a set in the first place instead of using a list and having to use your last function?
I very often use [`paco`](https://pypi.org/project/paco/), it simplifies asynchronous processing a lot.
The exit condition is \`self.exit\_chosen\` which is set here: \`self.exit\_chosen = self.menuitems\[-1\]\[1\].lower()\` Can you remind me what this syntax means again? \`\[-1\]\[1\] \` The code might benefit from some comments in my humble opinion. Thank you. &amp;#x200B;
TQDM is a nice progress bar that you can very easily use on any "for" loop, just to know how long it will take. I use it on almost everything. E.g. from tqdm import tqdm l = ['this', 'is', 'a', 'list'] for word in tqdm(l): do_something(word) &amp;#x200B;
Pyqt5 is absolutely not dated. If you're going to be playing with anything you install from pip, I highly encourage you to read my [Extreme Advertising edition poster](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/a7dcnk/python_virtual_environments_extreme_advertising/) on using Virtual Environments. 
I use pandas and requests all the time
Honestly? I would write my own - I've never been happy with most out of the box solvers. I suspect numpy might have one, but I don't know for sure. Do you have the option of writing your own solver in C/C++ and calling that routine from Python, or would that cause the same issues as using GSL?
I would recommend the free 'course' on this site for python. https://www.sololearn.com Really easy and approachable. They show basics and some advanced stuff. They also have an app so you can learn on your phone.
Just called, they said they can't find it without a tracking number
Future me here, I was bored over a weekend and generated a pie chart in matplotlib. literally just made a python 3.7.2 venv, then `pip install matplotlib` and it installed and generated my simple pie chart fine. 
[removed]
I had no problems under Ubuntu 16 and python3 using a venv :D
Thanks for your feedback :D
Thanks for your feedback :D
Indeed it is. @Op if your interested in scraping check out scrapy. Works well with bs4. 
`parsel` and learn XPath. More powerful than using the BS4 selectors and standardized so it'll be useful elsewhere. You can also cheat and combine it with CSS selectors for some things.
You can do Xpath on lxml too
&gt; I found bs4 a pain to install on both Windows and Unix machines In Linux it's literally just pip install requests beautifulsoup4 i assume it isn't much, if any, different in Windows.
Why? It has nothing to do with js, it's just how floating point works. However, the fact that js does'nt have an integer type is moronic.
passlib, getpass, hashlib if you want some kind of user ID password stuff
Same Python and GSL versions on each? I can’t imagine that pure Python could beat even slow GSL.
Pandas Numpy Logging Flask Json PySide Multiprocessing Are sure worth to look into :)
Because I'm not a good programmer and I have no idea whats going on and it hurts my brain trying to figure out what is happening. :( I just tried it in python too and my soul has been further crushed. Halp.
I really like the pathlib module. It provides easy folder/file structure manipulation and information.
I think [requests-html](https://html.python-requests.org/) has it beat.
Saved straight to disk or displayed in a window? And which OSX? Maybe mine is just too old. Which virtual environment software do you use?
Now to be clear, I know you said GUI/networking modules are your cup of tea. But I'm going to take this opportunity to plug one of my absolute favorite modules that I use all the time: [Keyboard](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard). This module allows you to add keyboard shortcuts to trigger functions in your code. An example: import keyboard as kb, os def refreshIpAddress(): # some method to be called via a keyboard shortcut (random example) os.system("ipconfig /release") # yeah I know you're supposed to use subprocess os.system("ipconfig /renew") def main(): myShortcut = "Win+Ctrl+R" # what the actual keys to press is going to be kb.add_hotkey(myShortcut,refreshIpAddress,args=None) # add the hotkey to trigger the function kb.wait("Win+Ctrl+Esc") # run this script forever until the user presses those keys if __name__ == "__main__": main() These hotkeys work globally across the OS, giving wayyy more power to your scripts and over your own computer. My 3 favorite scripts I have written so far using this are: * Advanced copy paste: Allows me to save multiple strings and then switch which strings I want to paste with keyboard shortcuts * MLA Header typer: Types a preformatted MLA header in my essays for when I need them (I can never remember the exact format) * MemeMachine: a script that contains several copypastas that I can bring up on the fly to copy and send to my friends at any given moment I also like win10toast, which allows you to create your own Windows 10 notifications. Handy tool to update the user on the status of a script from win10toast import ToastNotifier as toast notification = toast() notification.show_message("Here is a title for the message", "Now here are the details of the message") &amp;#x200B;
I'd say if someone is learning Python, learn Python 3.6 and don't look back.

Out of a tuple of tuples `tuple[-1][1]` picks one specific element with negative numbers counting from the end. Negative indices starting with -1, normal ones with 0 as usual. menuitems\[-1\]\[1\] goes to the last tuple and picks its second element which is the option "E" in the example. An finally `str.lower()` assures that a user can type "e" as well as "E". I am not too happy with this line of code because it doesn't speak for itself. Also I see that I didn't name things clearly enough. The `quit` function you mentioned earlier would be named better as "pre\_quit\_routine" or something like that. With `exit_chosen` I'm still struggling. That is because initially everything had German names and I changed them for Reddit. I share your opinion about comments. TBH I was too lazy to translate them. Hope this helps anyway. Just keep asking!

Thanks. I'm trying to keep any specific 3d application out of the equation because I'd like to be and to release this as it's own standalone app to various different facilities doing 3d graphics work and the usually have very strict pipelines and wouldn't want to have to install blender for hundreds of people just to use my simple program. Worst case, I might have to build this into Maya, but I'd love to avoid it and make this it's own thing.

Tkinter is outdated, but Qt absolutely isn't; it's actually maintained properly by Qt itself now, which is widely used and has quite a following. Most of the work I do is client/server work, not desktop, so for me it usually amounts to choosing a server framework: * [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/), perhaps combined with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a great tool for building APIs with full-featured CoreAPI schemas, GraphQL, all that. * [Falcon](https://falconframework.org/) is great for something lower-level, that exposes HTTP more or less directly. * [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) for "traditional" web pages. * [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) for database interaction, FTW. * I haven't used it yet, but [Graphene](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene) looks *really interesting*. From there, you get out into more specific libraries that are for specific purposes, from hashing to security.
[https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/powered\_by.html](https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/powered_by.html) short answer - yes
Fair enough. But afaik Blender has a cli interface and no need to install unzip and use. 
What? This was not on Mac. However you shouldn't be using your system's python install. This was on Arch Linux using Python 3.7.2, using [this pie chart example](https://matplotlib.org/examples/pie_and_polar_charts/pie_demo_features.html) with matplotlib 3.0.2 code runs fine and a graphical window to display the color pie chart pops up just fine. $ pythom -m venv matplottest $ cd matplottest $ source bin/activate $ pip install matplotlib $ python testplot.py 
[https://docs.python-guide.org/](https://docs.python-guide.org/) Kenneth Reitz put this together to answer just this question. Take a look at "scenarios" if you have something in mind that you want to build, but don't know what the "community" supports.
I've honestly had some fun with difflib!
bs4 can use the lxml backend to do its parsing. That way you get the performance of lxml and the (IMO) ease of use of bs4 for navigating the document tree: soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'lxml')
So, as others have said the most important thing for performance is algorithmic efficiency which isn't Python specific at all. As far as Python performance goes, I don't know that there's that much in the way of materials out there. Straight Python is incredibly slow as far as programming languages go, and trying to write 'optimized' Python is usually a wasted effort - if you care about performance that much, use another language! There are approaches to making Python performant: You can write performance critical code in C and call it from Python, you can use an existing library written in another language (see `numpy`) for performance critical code), you can use Cython instead of Python, or you can use PyPy instead of standard Python. You may have noticed the common thread here: all of these solutions involve using something that isn't vanilla Python. Basically Python itself is slow enough that if performance is an issue the solution is to use something else, not to try to get extra performance out of Python.
I would say the problem already exists. To be clear you would NOT want to use a library like pathlib to write a filemanager, or a low level text/binary editor. If your expectation is that the application can and should be able to modify ANY file on the system, then pathlib is ALREADY an inappropriate tool since you cannot simply: `Path(b"\x05")` and instead have to do weird stuff with `os`. If you have to use `os` just use `os` and skip `pathlib` entirely. If however you are writing a tool of more limited purpose, likely targeted at end-users, then you probably don't want to allow them to manipulate arbitrary files. For instance maybe you are writing an image viewer. In such a situation you would probably want to limit your application to only seeing jpegs or pngs to begin with. Very little is lost by also hiding files with "bad characters" in their names, or respecting the "hidden" attributes/naming conventions of Windows and Unix respectively.
Click for great command line interfaces!
Of course it was ... why is everyone taking that seriously ffs.
If you thought I was being serious...

pandas, pyarrow, aiohttp, sqlalchemy, asyncio, jinja2, openpyxl, jgutils &amp;#x200B; I do a lot of ETL/data-pipeline/REST/reporting work. Qt for python (pyside2) is now officially supported by the Qt team. I would expect it to be actively maintained going forward. I haven't done much with Qt as most of my work is backend but If I were to need a GUI I would use it. &amp;#x200B;
Well \*my\* python code is faster than most C++ / Java apps of comparable, significant complexity. Python gets its speed by helping you avoid Stupid Design Mistakes which commonly plague lesser languages. Seriously, as your application grows beyond trivial benchmarking examples, you find that it's overall speed is determined by how efficiently you use the hardware it's running on and how well you choose your application object structure and algorithms. As complexity increases, all applications tend towards the speed of an interpreted language. If you want more speed, learn about your hardware. Learn about CPU caches, virtual memory, page sizes, memory locality etc. Don't sweat the language choice. Python is plenty fast enough (most of the time. Use Cython when it isn't, for those inner loops).
Looks like requests-html is an extended version of requests or am I wrong? What is requests capable of doing which requests-html can’t?
Do built-ins count? Because itertools is just amazing, once you start using it! I does definitely provide for some cleaner shorter code, and is super efficient. https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/itertools.html
Yeah I understand that aspect but I was wondering was it general practice that in programming/ software engineering jobs a requirement for knowing x language is overlooked if you know y language which is similar to x.

I have been expanding on my DNA encoded library application and implemented a feature we currently need in our research lab. Luckily I made a few good design choices which made a lot easier. I just hope there is not another weird edgecase feature that I have not thought of yet. At the same time, I also cleaned up a few bits of code. Now its just documentation left to do.
I should have written that the link is the "see details" button, blue, at the bottom of the article. The link that works anyways.

requests-html looks to just be a replacement for BeautifulSoup, in that it gives you a way to parse/step-through/get data from HTML files. requests is a way to actually get the HTML files from urls. (i.e., a replacement to urllib) You can use requests + bs4, or you can use requests + requests-html, if you need to parse data from "The Internet". If you're only planning to get data from locally sourced (organic, obvi) HTML files, you could just use requests-html.
pandas, numpy and sqlalchemy 
Requests-HTML is a wrapper that goes together requests and a css selector library. Not fancy in itself but nicer and quicker than requests+bs4
Wow that sounds so cool!!
Maya uses VTK under the hood, so you could use that instead. It’s my preference for my 3D FEA GUI. Combine that with pyqt or py side (I use qtpy which supports both) and you’re good.
these are pretty neat; thanks!
someone posted this list of libraries yesterday that has been pretty interesting to click through: https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python 
The thing confusing me is the example given at the start of the start: HTML.Session.get(http://www.python.org/) just looks like the requests.get implementation. So using both requests + requests-html looks inadequate imo. 
That’s funny anyone finds their pyinstaller code is faster. My tests show a fairly consistent 10% slowdown and have for years. My path is also crazy long. I do mainly numerical processing and 2d/3D visualization. 90% of the time is spent doing math or plotting or 3D rendering. The bulk of the code is just file parsing. Python’s speed is fine for me and I’m occasionally processing datasets of 10 GB. The real speedups are found by using libraries correctly.
Right, but the line right before that also says: &gt; Make a GET request to python.org, using Requests: &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; from requests_html import HTMLSession &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; session = HTMLSession() &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; r = session.get('https://python.org/') Go down a little on the page, and you'll get to: &gt; Using without Requests &gt; You can also use this library without Requests: &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; from requests_html import HTML &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; doc = """&lt;a href='https://httpbin.org'&gt;""" &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; html = HTML(html=doc) &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; html.links &gt; {'https://httpbin.org'} If you actually pull up the library, [it actually `imports requests`](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests-html/blob/master/requests_html.py#L10) itself, and [lists it as a dependency](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests-html/blob/master/Pipfile#L7). So it'd be pretty hard to use it without requests, but, if you have some HTML that you've written yourself as a variable, requests-html doesn't require it to be a requests object. It just sorta... Encourages it.
Only time I've seen a speedup was when comparing the frozen runtime to the runtime in our production environment... which had a PYTHONPATH about 1500 directories longer than required. Problems of VFX, where we build environments dynamically and everyone is afraid not to include the kitchen sink.
r/learnpython should be able to help you out.
Libraries - `logging` which I wish I had started using much earlier instead of `print` - `pathlib` (`pathlib2` if you need python2 compatibility). - `click` for cli programs - `lib3to6` converts newer python syntax to be compatible with older versions. - `bokeh` for data visualization. Tooling - `black` or `straitjacket` for code formatting. - `pytest` for unit testing. - `mypy` for type checking. - `pudb` is the most flexible debugger I have found. You'll need to spend an hour or two to learn the shortcuts and set your editor up to easily add `import pudb;pudb.set_trace()` with a hotkey or snippet, but the effort is worth it. 
If you are looking at itertools, toolz provides a bunch of really useful extensions to it (there is also cytoolz, which is identical to use, but faster and slightly harder to install). And there are several installable versions of the itertools recipes described at the bottom of the itertools documentation. Boltons also provides some nice, general-purpose addons to the standard library. Dill is a more advanced version of pickle that can store stuff pickle can't, and has facilities for dumping an entire python session to a file and restoring it later. Hypothesis is a good tool for testing. Tools like pytest let you test your code, but they require you to anticipate what sort of input it will get, which makes it easy for corner cases (inputs you didn't think of) to get through. Hypothesis, on the other hand, throws random data at your code (including common corner case inputs) in an attempt to find something that you didn't think of that will break the code. Of course you can set limits on what sort of inputs it will try. line_profiler and memory_profiler help you find performance issues in your code. 
No, and therein lies the problem I think, their version fo GSL is much older. The issue is the HPC is in a different institution, so trying to get them to accept my requests for software updates etc. fall on deaf ears. The speed difference between GSL and a python version don't bother me so much, it's the difference between dynamic timestep and fixed that interest me. Our collaborators maintain a codebase that's used for modelling the same simulation (on the same HPC) written in C++, my python is to act as an independent check. When they switched to a fixed-step solver, they got a x15 performance improvement, which would more than solve my problem.
Scipy has one, but it's dynamic timestep, it does the job but far too slowly. I imagine a C++ solution would run into the same GSL issue, but I could write it in pure python. I'll have a look at a tutorial and get stuck in over the weekend. Thanks. 
When I've had to use pure Python for numerical methods, I've had remarkable luck using numba and just-in-time compilation (I am iterating on my prototype implicit particle-in-cell code in python and numba has given me 1 or 2 orders of magnitude speedup for little to no extra development time). Dunno if that would work for you; I'm not 100% clear on what numba does under the hood if I'm being honest. Good luck!
https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python is a good place to start. playing with anaconda could also introduce you to some neat things. I also recommend getting pipenv setup such that you're automatically switched to the correct virtual environment/not messing up your system python whenever you're simply in that directory. 
I honestly want to find more dev work in Python, because I like it so much. It was my first language, and I've been working in different languages for most of my coding career. I build most of my personal projects in Python
I think by tinker you mean tkinter, for creating UIs. Some I would suggest include: socket (built in) for networking pyautogui (install with pip) for automating mouse and keyboard input json (built in) for working with Json files sys (built in) for working with the OS requests (built in) for dealing with and making http requests And sqlite3 (install with pip) for working with sqlite databases
Bumping for information
3.7, I really like data classes. You should generally always start with latest one.
Well, I stick with what's easily deployed to PaaS type things.
Can confirm from personal experience, they work beautifully together.
Try it out. Back in the days we had a cron job to restarted our python website every day ;)
Nitpick requests is not built in, and author doesn't want it to be. On the other hand sqlite3 is built in. Perhaps you mixed up the labels.
Proof reading, the arch enemy of the programmer
Plenty covered all ready so I'll just mention that once you've dived into itertools check out [https://pypi.org/project/more-itertools/](https://pypi.org/project/more-itertools/)
/r/sqlalchemy is dead. If you don't get help here, try some of these other [support resources](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/support.html). 
How comfortable would you recommend? I know the beginning/basic syntax
Why would you do this to your poor users?

Python can call literally anything written in any language. That's part of the beauty of it.
== cries in assembler ==
I think you had it the other way around, but in spirit of your question, `requests-html` can render JavaScript contents so it's super useful for pages that uses dynamic contents.
DO NOT use pickle, it’s horribly insecure and can lose data if you modify the class you pickled.
These are packages that I almost always use in my projects: - pip - setuptools - setuptools_scm - takes version from a git tag - wheel - to generate wheels for deployment - pytest - pytest-runner - allows to run pytest by calling `./setup.py test` - pytest-cov - generates coverage report - mypy - static type checking - pip-tools - generates "lock" file containing fixed versions, and `pip-sync` makes sure exact versions are installed Some that I like a lot: - aiohttp - SQLAlchemy - psycopg2 
I don't know what you mean. `Path` doesn't take bytes, but `Path(os.fsdecode(b'\x05')) works fine. As to your second example: suppose I write that image viewer, and use it to view `NUL.jpg`, a very valid filename on Linux. According to you: python3 myimageviewer.py NUL.jpg ... should throw an exception if myimageviewer happens to use pathlib for processing its command line arguments.
+1 for \_\_future\_\__, a little underappreciated
It seems interesting though I haven't had the time to use it in enough detail to be giving too detailed of an opinion on. 
Because users shouldn't have anything to do with your requirements file, and vice versa. The setup script contains your runtime requirements, with as loose a version constraint as possible in order for it to keep working. The requirements file sets up a fully-featured development environment, with hard version constraints in order to keep developers and CI on the same page. The only exception to this is if you're shipping a standalone binary which doesn't need to play nice with any other python activities.
Where I work, we call it "dependency introduction".
Thank you
For libraries that would be most used in the "real world", I would learn sqlite3 which is part of Python's standard library and also pandas library. You'll need to learn how to make CRUD applications.
But contrast that with *not invented here syndrome*. I think you need to go back to first principles with this one. Do whatever allows you to deliver the most value with the least resources measured over whatever time frame is the most appropriate.
Im completely new in python and prpgramming hope I can learn the basics in the next 5 months 🙏🏾

I am so surprised. It's been more than 3 hours and no one has so far suggested **pathlib**. Simplifies file management to a great extent. 
Because... &amp;#x200B; PYTHON!!! &amp;#x200B; its also because I am using a lower end computer to do this as I play stellares on my desktop monster and I am very familiar with python. I prefer to use python over other programing things since it just seems to make 
Yes if you're supporting Python 3.5 you won't be able to use `pathlib` as easily yet. Python 3.5 doesn't accept `Path` objects in the built-ins or the standard library, only strings. I mentioned this in my previous article but forgot to reiterate here. Thanks for pointing that out.
For working with dates and times I found [Pendulum](https://pendulum.eustace.io/) to be a good, approachable tool.
99%? Do you do a lot of number crunching or is there some huge benefit to pulling in a third party dependency to simply using the built in list?
Haha good point, I was trying to not sound like an asshole.
if the dungion is pre made and set then you can give every room a number. you can then say if proom==\*number\*: do this this and this &amp;#x200B; if its a big room then devide it into sectors and assighn them numbers as though they where there own room but specify they are in one space when you describe it. &amp;#x200B; if its randomly generated then I have no idea how to help
Let's see ... * argparse * collections.defaultdict * datetime * getopt * itertools * json * matplotlib * numpy * openpyxl * os * pandas * queue * re * sys * types.SimpleNameSpace * unittest
I've been using openpyxl a lot....seems like you're not working in finance like me though
I'm more concerned with removing implicit string concatenation. At least `+` is explicit. ;)
Qt looks like the best option for me, try using PyQt5. If you wanna try a CLI interface you can use prompt-toolkit
These are going to be pretty specific use case but these are some libraries I've used for work and personal projects with apis and sdk development. They saved me a lot of time both writing and debugging, as well as make just the most readable code. * \[Click\]([https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/)): Really good for creating command line tools. I don't think technically this is only useful for an API, but its how I've used it nearly exclusively * \[Uplink\]([https://uplink.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/quickstart.html#defining-an-api-client](https://uplink.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/quickstart.html#defining-an-api-client)): This has been the crown jewel for me at my job. I spend a lot of time working on both server and client side of APIs. Uplink is for the client side and has made writing sdks so so so SO easy. Bonus points for how stupidly easily readable your code is. * \[SQLAlchemy\]([https://www.sqlalchemy.org/](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)): This is one that I don't have a lot of experience with personally because a lot of this work is done by other engineers, but they swear by it and other people in the comments similarly seem to like it a lot. * \[Flask-RESTPlus\]([https://github.com/noirbizarre/flask-restplus](https://github.com/noirbizarre/flask-restplus)): A nice extension of \[flask\]([http://flask.pocoo.org/](http://flask.pocoo.org/)). The big thing I like about this is that it has built-in support for \[swagger-ui\]([https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/)) which I personally find to be a critical and invaluable tool for API development. These might be a bit advanced for where you are right now, but they also might not be! I don't know! My experience with python has been very "pick it up as \[Company\] needs you to". Hopefully you or someone reading these comments find it as useful as I've found them :) Have a good day and happy developing!
There are very few operators that can't be overloaded. We can't overload `is` because identity is always identity. We can overload `__bool__` for truthiness tests, but `__and__`, `__or__`, and `__not__` don't exist because `and`, `or`, and `not` rely on `__bool__` and don't do anything further. It's [been suggested](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0335/) to add this. From my understanding there are potential performance and clarity concerns that would need to be worked around. It was decided (so far at least) not to overload those. Everything in the realm of truthiness delegates to `__bool__` and that's as close as you can get. I believe those are the only operators that can't be overloaded. I'd love to hear other examples if I've missed some though.
['attrs](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs) is a great library that will let you declare classes in a more neater way. For example, following declaration of a class with `@attr.s` decorator would let you do something like this: ``` @attr.s class Dummy(object): x = attr.ib() y = attr.ib() def sum(self): return self.x + self.y dummy = Dummy(5, 7) print(f'x: {dummy.x}, y: {dummy.y}') print(f'Sum = {dummy.sum()}') ``` Aso, in my example above you can see usage of [f-strings](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/), available as of Python 3.6. Neat way to interpolate strings, or in other words combine them with variables or even expressions. I also use [pip-review](https://github.com/jgonggrijp/pip-review) to keep libraries in my projects up-to-date. `pip-review --local --interactive` gives me list of all out-of-date libraries and an asks which ones I want to update. [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) for code linting. There's also `pylint`, but I found it too verbose and bitchy. `flake8` let's me quickly lint my code and check for reasonable errors. [python-slugify](https://github.com/un33k/python-slugify) to slugify strings. It leaves only alphanumeric characters, hypens, and maybe a few more very "standard" characters. This is a good library when you have to check for duplicates and catch cases like `Muse - Resistance`, `M U S E - R E S I S T A N C E` and `~~~ Muse - Resistance ~~~`. It's also useful if you want to e.g construct safe url paths from some string or sentence. And I also love [Scrapy](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy), flexible crawling and scraping framework, which hides boilerplate below the hood but still gives you full control over the scraping process. I am using it professionally and writing scrapers in it is super enjoyable. It's 01 am here and I got back from the bar, those are few of the top off my head, if I think of more I'll edit this post. :) 
I made my own GUI RSS Reader, I called it Cygnus. It is doing all its job, but my problem is too CPU usage and the objective is to optimize it. It could be 2 thread classes, maybe I should merge it into one class, I'm still working on it. &amp;#x200B; GitHub: [https://github.com/blooser/cygnus](https://github.com/blooser/cygnus) &amp;#x200B;
FastAPI is such a convenient thing. I love how it uses type annotations to generate docs.
Agree, literally the best datetime library I've ever faced in Python world. 
Me too. There was a really cool project that did something similar called ApiStar. Then halfway through, the author decided he was going to take the ApiStar name and apply it to a totally different idea. I was like *how do I upgrade?* and the answer was, *Oh, this is a different project now.*
Path doesn't take bytes, but on Posix systems paths are bytes. There is no way around that. Python strings are NOT the primitive object that paths on posix systems are constructed from. The primitive objects are byte arrays that do not contain NUL (0) and forward slash (47) So if you want a tool that can access an arbitrary posix path then you need to be using bytes everywhere and have to use `os.fsdecode` everywhere. That all seems a bit silly to me. Why should we be doing `Path(os.fsdecode(x)) / os.fsdecode(y) / os.fsdecode(z)`. -------- As for NUL.jpg... throwing an error would be a very good idea. It would prevent the linux user from creating a file that they might attach to an email, and send off to their grandma, who suddenly finds that the file cannot be accessed when she downloads it. Similarly if a Windows user wishes to name their file ".jpg" that would cause problems for a naive Linux user who downloads the file and can't seem to find it when they open the containing folder in their GUI file manager. If you don't care about cross-platform compatibility, then `os.path` would seem more than sufficient for your purposes. It seems to me that the primary purpose of `pathlib` is to address this cross-platform compatibility issue, but then it doesn't fully address that issue.

My first programming language that I currently learn and I love it.
I wrote my first Python program using CherryPy micro framework. Introducing Invoice Helper 2.0 :) https://invoice02.planetslav.ca
Good job so far! Some feedback from me: 1) you mention having a console arg handler, by which I think you mean being able to pass arguments in as command line args? If yes - good job, defo the right way to go, if not then I defo recommend you add this. 2) not python specific but Object Oriented Programming good practice: instead of using one file, split up the file into a number of classes. E.g countWords could be in one class, getLinks and verifyLinks in a second class, the main method in its own class etc.. A class should be small and have a small, focussed responsibility in your program. 3) keep methods as small as possible, and make sure they only have one responsibility. For example, countWords has an if statement that is 6 lines long, and the whole method is 16 lines long. Abstracting the contents of the if statement into its own method makes your code easier to read and more maintainable. 4) (a picky one!) You have a tmpResult variable in verify Links. tmpResult could be the name of any variable in any program in existence, so for someone new reading the code it's hard to see what that variable represents. Ideally, code should be self-documenting where possible. Its impressive that your program does something very relevant and useful, I always found it hard to find a useful project to practice with so well done and keep going! Hope that helps :)
Of course! I really liked the Udemy course "Complete Blender Creator: Learn 3D Modelling for Beginners" I've no look to the platform or creators and I've taken the course (paying the full price cost of £10 at the time). The difference is structure. The courses are structured to give you the fundamentals and then have projects to introduce those skills and apply them. Blender is like flying a 747. It is an amazing tool but impossible to sit down and just get.
Yeah...I'm going to say that's not standard. I'm a bit past the Windows XP path limit, but not much. I make my exe's as small as possible by using a base Python install, removing Tkinter, and deleting things like pip after I'm done using them. It's gets me from a 300 MB exe to a 70 MB. It's still slower.
I have two main classes, one for the player and one for the rooms. The Player has a PlayerLocation and the Room has a RoomNumber. The dungeon is a big square divided into 25 smaller squares on a 5x5 grid, starting at one at the farthest top and left, going to 25 on the furthest bottom and right. So going up subtracts 1 from the room number, down adds 1, left subtracts 5, and right adds 5 So I think maybe doing something like this might would work (pardon the shit formatting, on mobile): Player.PlayerLocation == Room.RoomNumber Input = input(“Choose a door. N/S/E/W”) If Input.upper() == “N”: (Indent)RoomNumber += 1 And -= 1 for south, -= 5 for west, += 5 for east Then later in the code, do like If Player.PlayerLocation == 1: (Indent)&lt;do room code&gt; And etc.
Your question is too vague. For more information, read [How to ask for (and receive) technical help on the internet](https://raspi.tv/2017/how-to-ask-for-and-receive-technical-help-on-the-internet)
As a beginner, I'd just start with the itertools and collections modules. Those give you a lot of cool stuff just by themselves.
Python is not better at interactive fiction than a language designed for interactive fiction. You're going to have to keep track of use state, what is and isn't possible, inventory, position, game state, and a hundred other things manually when inform would do it automatically. 
I'm definitely more focused on learning curses than making an actual roguelike. I figure it'd be good to be able to develop terminal applications where I could observe and control a lot of data simultaneously than just do things one command at a time.
Have you worked with FastAPI a lot? I'm looking at it and the code looks so similar to Flask-RESTPlus. Do you know the differences/benefits between the two by chance? I pretty new to python but the work you're talking about is stuff I'm going to be doing a lot more of so I'm trying to find well-liked libraries &amp;#x200B;
&gt; Path doesn't take bytes, but on Posix systems paths are bytes. There is no way around that. Python strings are NOT the primitive object that paths on posix systems are constructed from. The primitive objects are byte arrays that do not contain NUL (0) and forward slash (47) I know paths are bytes, but in practice they are always UTF-8 encoded strings. It makes no sense to reason about paths as bytes until the very moment the Python runtime actually performs a filesystem operation under the hood. Python, unlike POSIX, does the right thing because no user actually uses a hex editor to compose filenames. &gt; As for NUL.jpg... throwing an error would be a very good idea. It would prevent the linux user from creating a file that they might attach to an email, and send off to their grandma, who suddenly finds that the file cannot be accessed when she downloads it. It wouldn't. It would prevent a Linux user from creating such a file with _my program_ and they will then file a bug report because it is a perfectly valid filename and every other program that doesn't use Python actually manages to handle these files. Worse, as my example showed, my program wouldn't even be able to _read_ from such a file created by another program. If you want 100% compatible filenames, that should happen at the filesystem level or kernel level, not the programming language level. &gt; Similarly if a Windows user wishes to name their file ".jpg" that would cause problems for a naive Linux user who downloads the file and can't seem to find it when they open the containing folder in their GUI file manager. But if a Linux user wants to name a file ".jpg" there is no problem (sometimes we _want_ to create hidden files) so now there is _less_ compatibility instead of more. &gt; If you don't care about cross-platform compatibility, then `os.path` would seem more than sufficient for your purposes. It seems to me that the primary purpose of `pathlib` is to address this cross-platform compatibility issue, but then it doesn't fully address that issue. It's not. [You can read the PEP for the motivation](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0428/). The real reason why I and many others enjoy using pathlib is that it make using file paths right easy. The API is elegant and too the point, abstracting over messy details like path separators and opening and closing files. It doesn't get in the way, it doesn't try to be everything to everyone. It does one thing and it does it right.
That guide is amazing! As far as Hettinger videos on YouTube, I’ve just found a playlist of random talks on random subjects. Is there a more organized playlist or channel that you recommend?
FYI, pandas is for data that's small enough to fit in memory, which is typically not what people mean when they say Big Data

Nah just any of his talks, they're all great. He has a Twitter that he uses to teach python
Yep - will add an edit to my comment. Shows how prevalent the buzzword is that I said "big data" when I really, really should have said "data analysis." Thanks!
&gt; I know paths are bytes, but in practice they are always UTF-8 encoded strings. And in practice filenames have extensions, they do not contain control characters, files are not named NUL or AUX or COM1, etc... I'm merely arguing that pathlib should enforce the predominant practice, while leaving `os.path` to handle at a lower level what is technically allowed by the specification. I would also note that I have on occasion encountered files that are NOT valid UTF-8 strings (but rather some latin-1 encoding), but I have never encountered a file named COM1.txt. So your notion that we should accept COM1.txt, but assume that all files can be represented by UTF-8 is, in my experience, deeply flawed. &gt; The real reason why I and many others enjoy using pathlib is that it make using file paths right easy. I find it no easier than `os.path`. In fact for many of my use cases it seems to make things harder.
+99999 for tqdm. I use this 100 times a day.
+1 for selenium, pickle, requests and socket
For gui, I really reccomend pysimplegui, its a wrapper for Tkinter and REALLY simplifies stuff, with all of the same functionality
I do a lot of number crunching, but i also find there's no downside to pulling in numpy. Anywhere I run my code has it setup already, and the overhead to load it is minimal compared to everything else that's happening. 
Welcome to Python! * Not to be pedantic, but semantic, libraries in Python are called "packages." A package is a very useful structure, and once you get comfortable with it, it's a very powerful one. Just as you'll use other people's packages in your projects, it will serve you well to structure your own projects as packages. * Save yourself some headaches and use PyCharm Community Edition. It's free and will help you a lot with debugging, installing packages and building virtual environments (if you want to), using Github, and lots more. It's pretty sweet. * Also in the save-yourself-headaches categories, just use Python 3. As for what's useful, everybody will have their own lists. It's like asking what podcasts are good: everybody has a different list of awesome ones. Built-ins I'm always importing: * os (as you mentioned), mostly os.path but... * pathlib is included now too, and it offers much more Pythonic ways of dealing with paths than os. I'm converting to it now. * sys... you just need it sometimes for finding out system stuff. * math (which you also mentioned) has basic math stuff I'm always surprised isn't part of pure Python. * time (especially time.datetime) is very useful for time-based debugging and for parsing and forming time strings and structures. * re is for regular expressions. Unavoidable, but nicely done, especially pre-compiled patterns and groups. Others I'm always installing: * numpy and scipy: numerical arrays and tools to work with them. * Pillow: tools for dealing with image files, especially useful when converting between images and arrays so you can use numpy/scipy methods. * matplotlib: make graphs and other diagrams very easily. * Pandas: (as others have mentioned) for data analysis. This should be a sticky thread...

What is “the right job”? Pickle comes with more pitfalls than benefits.

Just don't Pickle unsanitized data and you'll be fine
That doesn’t match any of my arguments.

&gt;* Not to be pedantic, but ... You realize that by saying this you are being pedantic, right? And you're also wrong. As in any other language libraries are still called libraries and contain one or multiple packages or modules. 
It does address the first one, for the rest you're probably using Pickle wrong, I'd just read the docs in your place

&gt; Warning The pickle module is not secure against erroneous or maliciously constructed data. Never unpickle data received from an untrusted or unauthenticated source. You said: &gt; Just don't Pickle unsanitized data and you'll be fine That should at least be “unpickle”. The other argument is that you [can’t unpickle a class if you modify its code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16269071/python-pickle-dealing-with-updated-class-definitions). Sure, you could write methods to make it work, but then you lose the “magic” part of Pickle…

Oh right my point was that matplotlib is a pain in the arse on Macs because of tkinter. On Linux it has always been fine for me.

using the word \`coding\` to describe \`programming\` is really starting to irk me. 
that is what I was wondering. beam is obviously really good at it. but that has nothing to do with the language erlang other than beam was written in erlang. it's a system designed around the actor model. you could build beam in anything given enough time. Or just use elixir/erlang/beam for your paralleling needs. but bitching that a language can't do what a system does. or faulting a language for not having a system like beam in it is kind of missing the point of what a programming language is. 
It's definitely a start. Thank you!
\&gt;A what would one use for this? &amp;#x200B; \&gt; B how else would systems communicate? &amp;#x200B; \&gt; C what language does support this? &amp;#x200B;
New editions of Mac and python do not have this issue with tkinter. Have you read [The official python page on the tkinter problem? ](https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/)
I only use C and Python, best of both worlds, imo the two best languages that man has made. C++ and Java are terrible.
Same for me, although I started cracking software first before learning to program so I knew about pointers before I even did a hello world. Learned C first and then when you find Python you truly appreciate it.

`six` and `__future__` are necessities when you need to be cross compatible between Python versions. `pydoc` is great when you're air gapped. `heapq` provides heap algorithms `string` has an interesting template mechanic `bisect` has operations for inserting items into lists in sorted order, rather than appending to the left or right and then resorting. Note the documentation mentions that &gt; Keep in mind that the O(log n) search is dominated by the slow O(n) insertion step. This is because, assuming that the container is a list, insertion is O(n) in the average and worst case. Searching for an index is binary search which is O(log n) in worst and average case. However it is better than the alternative, because while appending is O(1), resorting the container is O(nlogn). `collections` has useful utilities for user made collections. Especially OrderedDict. Note, that while as of (3.5 implementation detail) 3.6 dictionaries are ordered, ordered dictionaries are still useful for compatibility, as well as equality order checking. Also notable are named tuples, ChainMap, and defaultdict.
yes. Python I believe is the best language for the job?

As a beginner there actually is a pretty good argument to learn straight python first. You're essentially putting the cart before the horse by asking for random python modules. You can spend weeks or months playing with all sorts of glittery toys--but it will actually probably slow you down learning how to program and use python. Learn the core of the language first so you actually understand what is going on when you use something like numpy, pandas, or requests. Your best benefit is to learn the language first. Knowing list comprehensions, various ways to deal with data (lists, dicts, sets, etc.), closures, classes, decorators, how to use virtual environments, manage code with git/github. Once you have a good foundation you can start to randomly find random bullshit--but really asking for "the best" libraries is likely saying you don't want to learn python you want to pretend to learn python.

Use SqlAlchemy or (simpler) Django ORM? They do give you a generic ORM layer on top of everything.

I tend to use pyodbc for connections so I have one module for everything. You do need unixodbc and the relevant drivers so that might be a problem for your environment. You also still have to worry about SQL syntax, not familiar enough with Oracle or your queries to know if you'd have to change the query text. If the syntax is different you might have to refactor to sqlalchemy or django orm as was suggested already or compartmentalize the SQL into separate fetch_data methods/functions and decide which to use at runtime.
For scientists or anyone who uses numpy or pandas - you need to look at xarray. It's basically multi-dimensional pandas, and it works so well that it's meant that everything I used to do with numpy I now do with xarray instead. Essentially my data objects now know that axis 0 is the 'time' dimension, and axis 3 is the 'z' dimension, so I can do operations like data['temperature'].mean(dim='time') Xarray DataArrays wrap numpy arrays so you can still use the numpy functions you've written. You can also keep using matplotlib/seaborn - in fact xarray makes this easier with methods like data['density'].differentiate(dim='height').plot(), which will automatically plot a line or color plot or whatever depending on the number of dimensions your data has. Even better you can often do all the analysis in parallel without writing any extra code! Xarray uses dask behind the scenes to achieve this. (dask is also a very interesting library to read about.) I'm a user of a plasma fluid turbulence simulation code and we're currently in the process of rewriting all the corresponding analysis tools in xarray instead of numpy.

Just flag the active database. Its WAY to hard to guess the millions of possibilities that you are configured under right now but, you can always set your DBName to a variable and swap it out. Just use a validation.
I don’t need to guess from a million. I currently know it will be one of two. But I don’t understand what you’re describing with the validation. There’s a config file that drives the thing, I have the dB provider (provider=‘oracle’) specified in there, so I’m poised to take the next step, just unclear on the best path. 
I use Alexa... ;)

You need ME to provide you with examples of why JS is bad!?!?!?!?!? You haven't heard about the recent node fiasco?!?!?!!? [Have you been hiding under a rock](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/11/26/npm_repo_bitcoin_stealer/)? Unless your JS code is COMPLETELY independent of packages (99% of JS apps use packages), I'd pretty much guarantee that anything running in JS is a security risk. I'm sorry to break it to you but Ruby, Python, and JS are ALL super dangerous to be running due to the likelihood that nefarious code can be run without the slightest warning to the end user. Also, I would actually recommend PureScript or GHCJS. 
Depends if you want to deploy to AWS lambda, for instance. Lots of environments have limited or no support for 3.7 still.

A +1 for Black &amp; pytest. One common comment you'll see about black is that people don't agree 100% with the decisions it makes. It's quite true. I don't always like some of its choices, but it's incredibly nice to not have to worry about differences between IDEs (slam it in a git hook or something). 
The logging module is really underrated, in my opinion. Does exactly what you think it should, exposes easy-to-use constructs, and it’s built-in. Amazing. 
It's infuriating when you've got 30-40 dependencies from people using libraries for 1-2 functions. Most of the time it's not as bad as leftpad, but still. 
If you want to build the algorithm from scratch I suggest reading up on the [shunting-yard algorithm ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm) and Reverse Polish Notation. If you just want to do it for a tiny project to get something working you could use ast.literal_eval, which is a saver variant of eval.

**Shunting-yard algorithm** In computer science, the shunting-yard algorithm is a method for parsing mathematical expressions specified in infix notation. It can produce either a postfix notation string, also known as Reverse Polish notation (RPN), or an abstract syntax tree (AST). The algorithm was invented by Edsger Dijkstra and named the "shunting yard" algorithm because its operation resembles that of a railroad shunting yard. Dijkstra first described the Shunting Yard Algorithm in the Mathematisch Centrum report MR 34/61. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
I’ve done this a number of times in various languages. There are tools that can help you out but it’s a really fun exercise to do it on your own as well. You divide the process into several stages. The first stage is to split your string into pieces that you can more easily process. This is called lexing or tokenizing the string (the noun being a lexer or tokenizer). The output is a list of tokens that were found in the string. For example, the string “1 + 2 * 3” might tokenize to `[1, '+', 2, '*', 3]`. The next step is to turn this into a data structure that is easy to evaluate. As-is, it is difficult to evaluate this expression according to the correct order of operations. You can choose to apply an algorithm like [the Shunting-Yard Algorithm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm) into an abstract syntax tree (or AST) or equivalent. The output of this might be the same list ordered in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) `[2, 3, '*', 1, '+']`. This process is called parsing and is a deep and rich topic on its own.

If it's just a calculator app, just use eval. If this is homework, then read the rest of the comments.
If your post starts with "I'm new to python" you probably want r/learnpython and if you can post samples/examples of your code that will usually help people to help you.
Maybe pyglet will fit your needs. It's pure python, and provides nice abstractions to drawing OpenGL primitives. pyglet is pure python, so you can just put it right in your app folder without needing to install anything. That makes it easy to ship, and it also can be packaged into a single executable using PyInstaller. Check out the examples folder in the repo for some examples of drawing things. https://bitbucket.org/pyglet/pyglet/wiki/Home
having just wrote an exhausting amount of CURL, PHP, and YAML to do an API for mySQL db, I will be looking forward to trying out FastAPI on an upcoming project. Thanks for mentioning it.

\`math.gcd\` is new in Python 3.5. However, I need to support Python 2.7 and up.
I used to work for a company where our product could work with an arbitrary SQL database. All SQL code was generic and when deployed it was translated for a particular SQL dialect. Compared to that SQL Alchemy is a god-sent. You can connect your program to any database vendor and it just works! Given it has quite learning curve, but I feel that learning it pays for itself. 
I am glad if it is helpful. Feel free to contribute and share your suggestions.
You need to give more details about your current skill level, and what you've programmed before. Otherwise the answers will be all over the place (see thread).
&gt;Unfortunately, to interact with the site you need to reverse-engineer the javascript of the site or use something like Puppeteer library for node.js to control the full-blown (preferably headless) browser. I am not aware of the second solution for Python, though. Alternatively, you can control the system itself with pywin32 for windows (I’m sure there are equivalents for other desktops) making it click here, click there.

I'm surprised this isn't the top comment and was going to mention it myself before deciding to search the comments first.
I personally think that typing ``` n = 2 if even(n): ... ``` is much simpler than typing ``` n = 2 if not n % 2 == 0: ... ```
data analyst is a joke 
Like what?
Well I suggest making a really simple game, maybe tic tac toe or connect 4. You can do this just with text and print statements in Python. The decisions your opponent makes is AI. First, make an AI that moves randomly. That could already be quite a challenge... from there you might think of ways to make it move better. You'll need to cover the basics of Python in a tutorial though. The longer and more complete the tutorial, the better. Good luck :o
Is making a simple chathbot "ai" with a metric ass load of if statements a good way to learn?
one good thing will even make people know time
I haven't ran your code yet (on mobile) but I think this can be changed, assuming you're trying to clear the text: &gt; if platform.system() == 'Darwin': &gt; os.system('clear') &gt; elif platform.system() == 'Linux': &gt; os.system('clear') &gt; elif platform.system() == 'Windows': &gt; os.system('cls') Can be changed to `print('\n' * 100)`, which will print a blank line 100 times and is platform independent. 
&gt; where Im not time sleeping enough Your loop should not run as fast as it can. I was actually skimming a book on gamedev in C++ today. They specifically mention the game loop (not just the rendering process) running at 60 frames a second. But your rendering doesnt need to be that fast. 
Depends what your experience is. If you can have fun writing a ton of if-statements, you should do that.
ast.literal_eval will only evaluate literal strings like "100", "[1,2,3, [4,5]]", "('a', 'b')", but it won't evaluate an expression like "1+1".
Ok, I think I'll make lists like "insults" and "greetings" and have random responses, and then I'll add to that till I can no longer recognise my own code but it works.
Either A)I haven't pushed myself hard enough to create something like this or B)I am not skilled enough for something like this. Either way, great job, I'm inspired. 
Cheers will check this out. For whatever reason (probably my own fault) multi indexes in pandas aren't leaving me satisfied right now. 
I'm still in the process of developing a discord bot for some servers I'm a part of to make life easier on me :joy:! So far its going well, over 300 lines of code on one file so that's fun. Had to learn how async stuff worked to make it which was fairly confusing but I think I get the hang of it now. Also trying out the reddit api for getting random greentexts from /r/greentext and sending them as pure images to the discord server, but its all a wip for now so yea fun times in python land. Also, the PyDev package for Eclipse is extremely helpful for those looking for an IDE.
Good bot
Thank you, deejpake, for voting on WikiTextBot. This bot wants to find the best and worst bots on Reddit. [You can view results here](https://botrank.pastimes.eu/). *** ^(Even if I don't reply to your comment, I'm still listening for votes. Check the webpage to see if your vote registered!)
Thank you, that actually looks really promising, and being pure Python I think that will give me the ability to really build this into my own frontend which is what I've been hoping for. Great find, thanks!
May the will of Pajitnov and the spirit of Woz inspire you, friend.
That's funny! I am, and continue to be, for loop averse. I learned vectorization before I learned looping (properly) and totally ate the dumb notion that python must be slow if you put a loop into your code. You're right, you shouldn't loop over a numpy array, you should run a vectorized operation. Yet, unless you're using numpy for high performance, avoiding loops is silly. 
This so much. Proper development is oh so rarely a simple black and white system. A rule against dependencies is great for some situations, and disaster for others. Anyone learning to code is going to make both extremes of this mistake. The best ones learn from those mistakes and bring that experience forward.

I suggest you to learn [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) first. Try to do some tutorials and apply it on a first "LITTLE" Project. After this try to learn the theory behind your algorithm you use. Repeat it...
The latest stable Anaconda distribution uses 3.6. So a lot of us will be sticking with that until Anaconda updates. 
Pandas is for data that fits into 1/10th of the memory according to the docs. 
5 days ago I said I wasn’t aware of second solution for Python, but [now I am](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) Thanks Reddit!
Pretty cool, this is the best way to learn. If you're looking for ideas on how to expand it, you should try asking it for a specific topic or keyword next.
Hardware solution: rent a server, aws etc Software solutions: not much really in python, write your own more specific methods I guess. Otherwise switch to C++ and/or R, inline or not. 
Remove that PATH entry for pip from the system wide environment variables and add it to the scripts that run after activating a conda end or virtual env. I’m not sure which files you have to modify but I’m pretty sure there are some custom scripts that runs automatically after activating an environment. 
The problem with eval is that it accepts and executes *any* syntactically valid expression. So if you apply it to unfiltered user input (or file input) there is a possibility that a malicious user could inject code to do something bad. You can get around this a couple of ways. As /u/ptmcg said, ast.literal_eval will process only expressions composed of literal values, no variable refs or function calls. That eliminates the danger of malicious user code injection. If you have to use eval, maybe because you want to give the user some vocabulary of function calls, I don't know, then you should find some way to "sanitize" the input string before evaluating it. However if you are just doing a class exercise and the only "user" is ever going to be you and your instructor, don't sweat it. 
Nice 
You have some bugs. First off it doesn't check if you use python2 and just appears to work until you get a random game over after dropping the first block. Second, I got a game over on this screen, for no apparent reason. https://imgur.com/a/LmfIcmE
The standard ML stack is numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, and sklearn, the first four of which I consider basically part of the standard library. I use requests for internet stuff which seems to have a similar status as unofficial standard library. If I'm doing any sort of image manipulation stuff, I find it nearly impossible to easily get around without Pillow. NLTK is also fun to play around with and makes advanced text analysis a lot easier, but I probably wouldn't classify it as must-have. Python itself has a *massive* standard library, and I'm constantly amazed at how much obscure and niche stuff it has in there (which I really like because that means it's officially supported and developed in some capacity, unlike certain languages which have few libraries you can trust will be cared for in the future if it's cared for in the present).
&gt;&gt; A it does not work for large data which needs to be shared between processes scenario &gt; what would one use for this? Large graph analysis? Think a few hundred millions/billions of nodes? Any other large system analysis? &gt;&gt; B processes communicate via serialization &gt; how else would systems communicate? With normal multi-threading (Java/C++ or even python itself), threads share in-memory data structures. No serialization overhead &gt;&gt; C exceptions donot propagate and have (or at least had) a tendency to hang the whole process &gt; what language does support this? Java? Python? The issue here is that communicating between processes is harder and multiprocessing module (in my experience at least) has not made it fully transparent
I'll look into that. The game over should only trip when a piece that just spawned cannot move down. By chance, when your game over occured, had you moved the piece at all? I may have forgotten to set a flag for that. Thanks for the report. A python version check shouldn't be hard either. I'll branch the project over the weekend.
When the machines can write their own language, then it will be true.
Very nice. I suggest you to try the new [format string literals](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings) and the [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library to optimize you script :)

Just a heads up -- `pickle` doesn't correctly serialize decorated functions and classes. Yes, I know that's a helluva niche. If you, like me, are chronically part of that niche, look at `dill` instead. Bonus, if you have to do multiprocessing targeting decorated callables, there's this neat thing called `pathos` which exposes a `multiprocessing` module which is API compatible with (at least) the meat of stock `multiprocessing`. It uses `dill` instead of `pickle` for serializing those decorated objects into multiprocesses and has other neat tools for heterogeneous computing (that I haven't tried and can't vouch for, but the API looks pretty cool!)
Pythonium.
Nice! Lots of room for refactoring I think, but that's easy for me to say as the person that didn't write it. Keep it up!
My Swiss Army knife: - `requests` -- an HTTP client geared towards RESTful APIs with a sane interface - `ipdb` -- a version of the stock debugger, but backed by iPython, featuring up arrow history, syntax highlighting, and tab-completion - `numpy` -- a high-performance, C-backed library for generic numerical computation - `pandas` -- a high-performance library for large-scale data ingestion, representation, and manipulation - `keras` -- a high-level machine learning framework, optionally using Tensorflow as a backend - `pathos.multiprocessing` -- an API near-clone of stock `multiprocessing` with better serialization using `dill` - `pylint` and `flake8` -- two extremely thorough linters - `pg8000` -- a PostgreSQL low-level driver. Used to use this, but I've since moved away to proper ORMs. Still worth an honourable mention since none of the ORMs do. IMO a lot of the gems in the rough are really in the standard library. `functools`, `itertools,` and a few others provide _hilariously_ powerful tools, and stuff like `dis` is really cool for analyzing your code 1337 hacker-like.
Ok I really need to know what those copy pastas are
Tbh I don't believe that you started programming last week, But if so, you learn really really quickly.
That is helpful. Thanks! I'll mess around with it.
Writing exceptions to fix bad data coming from APIs :(
I ended up removing my virtualenv requirements and adding `# Using pip to install packages inside conda environments. cpip() { ERROR_MSG="Not in a conda environment." ERROR_MSG="$ERROR_MSG\nUse \\`source activate ENV\\`" ERROR_MSG="$ERROR_MSG to enter a conda environment." [ -z "$CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV" ] &amp;&amp; echo "$ERROR_MSG" &amp;&amp; return 1 ERROR_MSG='Pip not installed in current conda environment.' ERROR_MSG="$ERROR_MSG\nUse \\`conda install pip\\`" ERROR_MSG="$ERROR_MSG to install pip in current conda environment." [ -e "$CONDA_PREFIX/bin/pip" ] || (echo "$ERROR_MSG" &amp;&amp; return 2) PIP="$CONDA_PREFIX/bin/pip" "$PIP" "$@" }` to my bash\_profile. &amp;#x200B; It doesn't force pip to be used inside virtual environments, but I rarely use them outside jupyter notebooks and this at least gives me an easy way to differentiate them. 
Hey there, just wanted to update you and let you know I've started on this project. Would you like me to update you with the code every now and then or just wait until I'm finished?
This is what I have so far https://github.com/AWN3ST/redditchallenge/blob/master/redditchallenge.py
I really don't know what Python's version of `open` does. What if it does `creat`, which you didn't capture or something else entirely? Once `strace` tells you what happened, you'll know what to look for.
Which exchanges do you pull pricing data from? Don’t these prices fluctuate based on the exchange?
Insightful comment.
Did you use any framework for this?
You just need an entry in the PATH in front of the other one. This might be more simple than removal. 
looking good so far. Now you might wanna think about removing all global variables. Remember you can pass/return values with functions. I look forward to your final code. 
For an online course without real mentoring? Not a penny. Python is one of the easiest to learn languages we have, and the internet is already saturated with excellent tutorials, courses and video lectures, all free and some really high quality. Sorry, there is no (non-ripoff) market for beginner-level python courses. 
it's all that comes to mind looking at the value of those packages.
Sounds dumb but if you want "true"-er random number generation in Python use the `secrets` module. Generates cryptographically secure random numbers.
Isn't there a 'activate' in the `bin` folder? You can do `source activate` to activate the virtual environment. Then you can use pip and python that's in that environment without problem. You can also directly execute the pip.py inside that folder, that should work too.
I haven't done any graphics project yet. The only graphics I've ever done is plotting using maptplotlib for machine learning models. But I am planning to do some graphics projects coz it looks like fun. Since you have done so, I would like to ask you some questions. From what I understand there are two modules for creating graphics - curses, and pygame. Is this correct? Are there other libraries? Which module suits what kind of project? Is there any reason you chose curses over pygame? Any other tips tricks would you like to share for doing graphics projects? 
This is pretty neat. Good job. 
If `D` is a 1D numpy array `Cmu = D.reshape(2, -1)[[1, 0], :]`

Reddit needs an option to turn all these things off in preferences ("autoblock survey bots"). I can see how they're useful but I don't want keep seeing these messages from all the thousands of bots.
Na don't use eval. Then you'll get "Hey, paste this into your calculator app to see pretty pictures" and next thing you know, the computer is pwned and your app is blacklisted as insecure.
You can reload a module, but you really should wrap the calculations in a function, and call that function in `main.py`
Could you give an example? Why should I do that in main.py, I want to keep the code as much structured as possible
You need to go to /r/learnpython, for your install problems you can try setting up a conda environment, or use a virtualenv, as its not that hard to get things up and running, esp. on Linux. That being said you will still need to train your models to recognise all custom objects, like family members and the like, once you have that done, doing the rest is pretty straightforward, as you can reuse the same models for both searching for similarity and actual classification.
I thought you want to do it in `main.py`? You wrap calculations in a function in `distributions.py`. Turning it from script to a module (the difference is purely conceptual, there is no specific script/module syntax). Then you call `distributions.calculate()` in main assuming your wrapper is `def calculate()`. It should be as simple as adding `def calculate():` and indenting everything one time. You may or may not leave class definition outside if you want to access it from main (even if not, that’s how it is usually done)
This is amazing, and good looking. Well done and thanks for sharing codes.
Yes it is true that I want to use calculations in main.py, but I dont want the entire code from distributions.py and put inside main.py :P 
If you actually want to learn AI vs just "coding" it, try the MIT OCW AI course. (Look on YouTube.)
No no no. You put calculations in the `distributions.py` into wrapper. And then `import distributions distributions.calculate()` If you for whatever reason (there are cases) cannot modify `distributions.py` the only way is to reload the module (it will work). 
This wrapper thing looks interesting, could you give an example on repl.it?
I sure am glad I got a CS degree back in the mid-90s, before all this "code your way rich...and quick!" garbage.
Anybody has any idea what they mean by (my emphasis): &gt; The two biggest differences between a tuple and a list are that a tuple is immutable and *allows you to embed one tuple inside another*. One can embed a list (or a tuple) in a list, so what's their point here?
Does this need a solution in code? Consumer products like google/apple photos can do face ID and recognition. If you need a code solution, try microsoft cognitive services. It's OK and free for trial use (or was when I checked last).
Probably a mistake.
&gt; Tuples are written with round brackets You may want to correct/clarify this. For non-empty tuples, brackets are just for precedence. It is the commas that define the tuple. See the explanation on the Python Wiki: https://wiki.python.org/moin/TupleSyntax

honestly i don't think that's a "bug". if someone runs code with the wrong language it's hardly surprising if it doesn't work. anyway, from the screenshot it appears that the pieces move by fractional character increments (ie smoothly). is that right? if so, how did you do it? also, have you tried running in different terminals? do you have problems with compatibility? how reliable is curses across terminals? i've done some curses-based programming, but used the urwidget library. it's a higher-level interface for text. don't think it would work here but it might save you some work for other projects.

Also uses considerably less [memory](http://www.pythoninformer.com/python-libraries/numpy/numpy-efficiency/) which can be important in some applications.

python is case-sensitive
So the reload module will make the [distributions.py](https://distributions.py) file start again from scratch? because i can not import file and run methods again because of the parameters inside the "distribute\_faster" method
This is a tuple: ```1,``` This isn't a tuple: ```(1)``` Anything claiming to be a tutorial, and still propagating the same misunderstanding of what makes a tuple, should not be taken serious. 
That's probably because your data is fundamentally multi-dimensional. There's actually a note in the pandas documentation saying that if that's the case you should just use xarray! 
If you need to develop an android app, this is the wrong sub bud. But i'll try nudging you to the right direction. Since you haven't developed before i wouldn't recommend jumping into android dev (especially if you're resulting to ask strangers online for help). It'll just discourage you from programming, especially with how depricated the android framework currently is (just read kotlen posts on /r/android and you'll see what i mean). What you could do though, is create a mobile friendly webapp, that you could interface through your android browser. So to hash out your idea, it sounds like you might benefit from leveraging the Trello App api (google trello python API). If you haven't heard of trello, or used it before, check it out. Once leveraged well, it'll be your best friend for task tracking (also popularly used in software dev cultures). The trello API is free to an extent. So play with that for a bit. By using the trello app + api you'll get some concrete structure how an organizer might be used. I also think you'll get some guidance to the calendar feature you mentioned. Once you do that, you just have to also develop your random quiz question generator. For that, i think you'll only have to google tutorials of `fullstack flask python note taker tutorial`. Those should give you enough direction to power through development. You then just have to expand the UI interface to accommodate trello functionality. Now that you have a workable program, you'll need to make it publicly accessible through hosting. For that checkout digitalocean. Other people might recommend hiruku, but the amount of educational resources in digital ocean is invaluable. So google `digital ocean hosting first webapp`. After that go from your phone browser to the url and test the app out, and fix any bugs.
That's hot. Editing my comment
This really looks great! Thank you!
Thanks! If you see any places for improvement or features to be added let me know!
Note: Library uses Instagram's public GraphQL API to get data.
Jesus Christ, thank you so much! I don't have any close relatives who program, and Reddit has always been good to me (As long as I use proper grammar and sound serious), but I never expected this! Thank you! &amp;#x200B;
Sure thing OP. Getting the right queries when you're first starting out can be challenging. But with the amount of online resources available today, it's more "bad karma" prone to ask questions without googling/researching yourself, before seeking external help. Hopefully the post up there gave you sufficient context to get the wheels going. Also, since you're new to python dev, and most people have a windows machine you might find it beneficial to setup your environment without anaconda. If your tutorials mention anaconda, try to use the package/lib manager `pip3`. If the tutorials talk about python 2.7, use python3 instead. One more thing, download the editor visual studio code and lookup tutorials in how to debug with it. When you face errors (those are usually called stack traces), the best thing about python is you can google those errors online. To help you decipher that stack trace feel free to DM me. But the gist of it is, you want to find the text closely pointing to the code you written, then figure out the objects causing this error (objects = variables to keep it simple - google python3 codeschool tutorials).
Estamos, en Zimatech Escuela de Robótica, armando un curso introductorio a Python, orientado a personas sin conocimientos formales de programación.
Yeah it's one of those things where I found pandas and it was revolutionary for me because of how powerful it was and how familiar everything was coming from SQL, but now that I've progressed I've just continued to use pandas poorly as my hammer for all new challenges.
I love visual studio code. Used it to make all my HTML projects ;D
Did you know docker reads a config file : `\~/.docker/config.json` ? I've got those two lines, among others, to help with the ps output : ``` { "psFormat": "table {{.Names}}\\t{{.Image}}\\t{{.RunningFor}}\\t{{.Status}}\\t{{.Command}}", "imagesFormat": "table {{.Repository}}\\t{{.Tag}}\\t{{.ID}}\\t{{.Size}}" } ``` This makes it fit inside 80 columns.
I always have a clear() function that looks like this: def clear(): os.system("cls") if "nt" in os.name else os.system("clear") A bit cleaner imo 😉
So I should use Trello to import tasks? But how would I go about building a UI? \*starts digging hole\*
Agree. Using the containers api would actually be easier than parsing output which could change imo.

I don't really know why one would need cryptographically secure random numbers for a game? Maybe you could elaborate why you think one would need this in tetris? 
How didn't this exist already. Extremely useful, thank you!
Yeah that definitely changes things! Part of my fear/ hope of posting this, was that I would find there was a much more simple solution. You sir are that person, thanks! I’m going to take a deeper look and see what if anything there’s left to do then. Thanks!
I'm sorry, I've definitely felt what you felt before ^(\^\^)
This is cool af.
Some of the code examples are out of order and don't work as reproduced, functions out of order in the script, it's set up for Python 2.7, quite a few really big single god functions where they should really be broken down, that sort of thing. It's good on the concepts and what you're doing, but you need a fairly decent (non beginner) udnerstanding ime to get why your code's not working when it's the same as what's in the book. (It's also pretty dated now, but that's just what happens with books - so Kali installation, etc., has changed a lot). 
Now that I have taken a closer look at the code, write some comments.Seriouly that practice will take you a long way. Almost all of your projects lack comments. 
Thank you for advice I will
Yeah. I also found it on a different website [here] (https://deals.thenextweb.com/sales/pwyw-the-python-master-class-bundle?utm_source=thenextweb.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=pwyw-the-python-master-class-bundle&amp;utm_term=scsf-307560&amp;utm_content=a0x1a000003oIbd&amp;scsonar=1&amp;amp=1). Seems to have the same price. I would be interested to know if it is worth it. 
May Turing bless you.
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo
nice. Didnt know `anyapi` before
This is a really interesting concept.
well this is normal because I just shared today in [r/python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/ahlqau/announcement_of_anyapi_a_python_library_to_help/) btw thank you for your interest
If using an external library is ok, then I recommend the excellent [numexpr](https://github.com/pydata/numexpr) package. I'm using it for evaluating expressions in configuration file of physical simulations: &gt;&gt;&gt; import numexpr as ne &gt;&gt;&gt; ne.evaluate('1 + 2*3 - log(4)').tolist() 5.613705638880109 
Im taking a quiz for class and cannot get this question right, beginning to think that there is an error in the question. On the right is my first attempt, got a 4 out of 5 on the question. So my assumption for the second attempt (on the left) was that since 5.51387 // 5 returns 1.0 then maybe the .0 was not what he was looking for. So I unchecked that box. And then my score was a 3 out of 5. So now im assuming i need to recheck that box. But now im not sure what to do because all of the other boxes do return 1. &amp;#x200B; Am I missing something here?
Very interesting. I am writing something very similar for work and will see if this may fit our needs 
My guess is that `bool(123)` is the odd one out here, because it technically evaluates to `True`, which is equal to 1, but _is not_ 1, though that's pretty questionable reasoning.
true = 1
Yeah, you've checked an answer which is wrong along with 5 correct items on the first go. Try to run all the commands and see what happens. Can't just give you the answer 
``` In [96]: 1 == bool(123) Out[96]: True In [97]: 1 is bool(123) Out[97]: False In [98]: 1 is int(bool(123)) Out[98]: True ```
I don't think you default dictionary unpacking is right on line 43/44. Though I'm not really sure how you pass values to \`make\_request\` through the weird dunder method. [https://github.com/FKLC/AnyAPI/blob/95cc0a80e80e43a12848724ae5e565c9f3c1adb9/anyapi/\_\_init\_\_.py#L43](https://github.com/FKLC/AnyAPI/blob/95cc0a80e80e43a12848724ae5e565c9f3c1adb9/anyapi/__init__.py#L43) &amp;#x200B; &gt;&gt;&gt; {**y} {'some': 2, 'thing': 3} &gt;&gt;&gt; x = {'data': {'some':1} } &gt;&gt;&gt; {**x.get('data', {}), **y} {'some': 2, 'thing': 3} # this has ignored "some :1" from x completely. &gt;&gt;&gt; {**y, **x.get('data', {})} {'some': 1, 'thing': 3} # now we see the default get overridden by the x value &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Doc strings on the class would go a long way. Also can you explain why you feel the obfuscated dunder method is better than just passing things direct to `make_request`. Seems like trying to hide something beneath a layer for no real reason. It's an interesting idea, I just can't work out what it gains. 
I don't think that's questionable at all. ```1``` behaves differently enough from ```True```. Off the top of my head: ```type()``` will return a different type and ```print()``` will print something entirely different.
I did run all items. I wouldn't be here if I didnt.
irony strikes again. Docker seems to be in *constant* change - getting updates &amp; improvements. Yet no one making contributions has thought of adding this natively. 
r/datascience
huh ?
Holy fuck, I started thinking about making something exactly like this just a week ago. Figured I could use it to hone my python skills and make something worthy of a portfolio... Guess I'm back to the drawing board, lol.
