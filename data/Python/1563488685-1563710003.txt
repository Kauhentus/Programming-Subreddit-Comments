Started teaching myself python last week. Parsing, plotting and calculating various bits of info from drone missions. Eventually the goal is to point to a directory where the various logs are. The script traverses and generates the various graphs and calculates the various data. Eventually with the goal to help troubleshoot.
Basically. For a (made-up) example: for i, upc in enumerate(upcs, start=1): try: write_barcode(upc, f'barcode_{i:04d}_{upc:012d}.png') except BarcodeGeneratorError: with open('redo_these.txt', 'a') as error_file: error_file.write(f'{upc}\n') Don't forget that you have `else` and `finally` with `try`, and `else` with `while` and `for` etc.
Thank you!
Yeah, just start working on your own projects in general. and then align yourself with a company that has a position that is near what you have been working on. This might be a helpful way to be strategic about matching jobs with experience.
Terrifying to think this can be out there. Isn't there some process for verifying libraries are non malicious?
it's sad, but I agree completely. I'm trying to decide what to shift to. Probably rust.
I've taught Python and other languages for years. I love teaching with pythonanywhere.com. That way you don't have to worry about students installing python on their own machines, and multiple OS support. The free account is more than enough for classroom use. Down side is you can't do interactive graphics like turtle, pygame, processing or tkinter. Up sides: Students can list you as a teacher, and then you can see and modify their code. Wonderful feature. Also, students can easily set up a web server with flask or bottle, and then set up their own web apps. That's been a big hit with the students, and I don't miss Tk at all. Students can work on their code with any web browser anywhere, so you don't need to do much in your lab. I have all my examples in my account and I can show and run the code live in class. I also wrote a quick program to make all of my code visible through a public web server, so students can see all my code, copy it and work on it on their own sites. Jupyter notebooks are nice for your notes because you can display code and run it all through the web. Kaggle.com allows you and your students to build a basic site for free. This is great if you want to add a data science component. I used to teach with Pygame, but it's a nightmare to have students install on their own machines (or was when I was doing it.). Pygame is dependent on SDL, which is a tricky install on macs. I still teach pygame, but in a senior course, where I don't worry about whether students can install software.
Wow! &amp;#x200B; Love your book man, thank you so much.
Have you considered using a desktop application, such as this one for MacOS https://kapeli.com/dash ?
The problem is that even if you have a well-vetted github project from trustworthy individuals, all it takes for that project to be compromised is for just one library in the dependency tree to become compromised.
That's a consistent nightmare. Even the different versions of windows are different, and Mac is just tricky. With all the various libraries you're talking about incorporating, you're going to have a support headache on your hand. That's why I went to an entirely cloud-based solution, and I mostly love it. (See my earlier post on that.)
Your name reminds me of r/beholdthemasterrace
Could you be more specific? What variables? What values do they have? When do you want to print them exactly? If you put your module on a pastebin site like [privatebin](https://privatebin.net/) as well, it'll be even more likely we'll be able to help you.
I think the fact that they were caught is important to point out here. The system of vetting and distributing open source projects is elegant when people are taking their jobs seriously. That's why you can rely on something like Debian's repositories to be rock solid but something like PyPI or the Arch User Repository shouldn't be used without some level of personal vetting or trust. For large projects I extent trust in the system (trust I don't think is misplaced at all). For small projects that haven't been vetted I use a virtual environment or I investigate it myself.
It’s first stage of a more complex attack. Get the libs out there and then insert two lines in someone else’s code - would probably pass most code reviews if the library name is generic enough

Look at the Multithreading or Multiprocessing libraries.
You should take a look at Nim (https://nim-lang.org/) before deciding to switch to Rust. It was really easy to learn Nim (almost fun) and same performance as C. The current version 0.20.0 has been designated a release candidate so 1.0 release should be out soon.

Two 1-hour classes a week isn't a serious course. Looking at the absurdly long list of topics, you're likely going to get a ripped off feeling in the end. There are 8 major topics shown. That means you're expected to cover each of those topics in 2 hours over a 1 week time-frame. It's too good to be true. What you'll get for that kind of investment by the teacher is going to be one small working example that covers maybe 5% of what can be done. Let's look at tkinter: &gt; **Building Graphical User Interfaces with Tkinter** \-Introduction to Tkinter \-Setting up a GUI with Widgets \-Connecting GUI Widgets with Callback &amp;#x200B; Looking at those bullets, they could write a 10 line program or less to show ALL of what they listed. Will you, as a result, know enough about tkinter to draw a GUI on a piece of paper and then go implement it straight away with no more education? tkinter isn't shown on many first year course outlines. They often, more often than not, never get to the topic. If you want a serious education, take one of the free college courses offered. Yes, they will be a ***LOT*** more time, but they will actually teach you the topics. If first year Python could be taught in 16 hours over 8 weeks, it wouldn't make Python a 1 term course.
So I wouldn't say I am working on anything as I am not capable enough to yet, I just started learning the basics of python through a beginners guide on youtube. Eager to learn more however it is quite scary.
Congratulations! Python is a super cool language and has a great community. Do you have any cool projects or goals in mind?
Hi there at the moment I am just focusing on learning the basics and getting my head around it all as I have never done any programming before, would you say it would be beneficial to have a project in mind whilst learning python?
Huh.
I'm not sure I understand how, but alright. At least I don't have to write a workaround for ads, because I can just build a playlist and listen to it, adfree already.
\&gt; jupyterlab-plotly extension and JupyterLab 1.0 support Yay!
The effort towards security is respectable, but I wouldn't call it elegant. It's basically a bunch of peer reviews and grinding man-hours.
After trying for a while this is what I came up with aswell and it worked thanks anyway though man.
Oh dear. And I was going to recommend `requests` for replacing `urllib` calls in our Python courses.
Open source ecosystems seem like total chaos but for the most part they work great. That's what I think is elegant about it.
Having just tried it on a bandit-clean codebase, it's much more domain-specific. Banning eval of static strings (which we need for 2/3 compatibility around syntax changes), use of `random` without `SystemRandom` (breaking seedable simulations etc), and a couple of others I didn't look into. Probably useful if you're writing something with specific security policies, but I'll stick with Bandit.
After your learn a little bit of the syntax, be sure to take on some projects to really give you some challenge and help you learn some important skills. Here are some good projects that you can work on: - A Fibonacci sequencer (for loops) - A madlibs game (working with strings) - An adventure game (functions and dictionaries) Good luck
Thank you for your prompt response I will most definitely be making sure I give those a go and I will make sure to let you know how I get on.
Of course, if you need more project ideas let me know, and if you need help with anything contact me. Btw practicepython.org is also a good site to use to get started.
Could it be that what you’re trying to do could be achieved by troposphere: https://github.com/cloudtools/troposphere
Use http3
Yeah totally! Just so you have something to work against as you learn. It also allows you to Target specific areas and libraries in python that would be useful to your side project instead of EVERYTHING. It doesn't have to be anything complicated, maybe you want to build a tictacto bot that always wins or draws, or you want to build a Reddit bot, maybe even a website or webapp. There are a lot of things you can do with Python, and I think targeting your learning to one area would definitely help. I recommend also learning how to use version control (like GitHub or Gitlab). This allows you to set "save points" for your projects, and allows others to look at what your working on, recommend changes, what have you. And at the end of the project you can go back and look at all the work you've done!
Post your data. This doesn't help at all.

Sorry man, my brain today... I want looking at your picture. One issue is with your indenting. It never gets to the return. Drop the num = num // base statement back to level worth the else statement. Drop the last four lines of decimalToRep() outside of the while statement.
According to that thread, it’s going to be taken over by the Python Software Foundation
def decimalToRep(num,base): result = "" while(num&gt;0): rem = num % base if rem in range(10): result += str(rem) else: result += chr(65+(rem%10)) num = num // base result = result\[::-1\] if(result == ""): return '' return result def main(): """Tests the function.""" print(decimalToRep(10, 10)) print(decimalToRep(10, 8)) print(decimalToRep(10, 2)) print(decimalToRep(10, 16)) main()

Yes. Use multiprocessing not multithreading.

Yup, programming has value
Not being VI I can’t speak for the quality of the experience, but I believe all of Eclipse, VIsual Studio Code, Netbeans, and PyCharm have screen reader support, though mainly on Windows. Unfortunately a quick glance at each seems to indicate that screen reader support on Mac is sketchy and Linux still very limited to non-existent. What I can speak to from experience is that any of those will make a perfectly fine Python editor / IDE, once properly configured.

That library's name is going to get really annoying when HTTP-over-QUIC happens.
Instead of a menu, make a button-bar, a bunch of buttons that form a "launcher" that you can keep running on your screen. Or, make a system tray icon to launch your programs. I started writing a bunch of utilities to make my life easier / better. One good one was a task killer that would narrow down the list of tasks as I typed characters. I can highlight as many tasks as I want and it will kill them all with 1 button push :-) POWER! Make a dashboard that watches your CPU Cores. Both this idea and the task manager one came from playing around with the psutil package.
Hey I'm just wondering, how does python work for machine learning?
Not really. The question of "Can you tell if &lt;some code&gt; has &lt;some property&gt; automatically" essentially always has a negative example (think of the halting problem). There's some arguments you can make for why this isn't an issue in practice (allowing false positives makes the problem easier), but still programmatically verifying properties is quite difficult without extensive code annotation, or intensive computations. More specifically, this is a difficult question because "malicious" isn't easy to define technically - its more of a social definition. Code is malicious if it works against a user's interests, but this is hard to technically formalize. In general verifying code as "safe" is a poor idea (especially since you can make code that's hard to tell it's unsafe even to an expert. See the "underhand c contest", although this is highly dependent on the prevelence of undefined behavior in c). Instead people usually try to work the other way, by making environments that can run unsafe code "safely". Terms to look up here are things like sandboxing and capabilities. I don't know what python does along these lines (if anything), but the easiest example of sandboxing is modern browsers with Javascript. Ignoring browser bugs, you can run "unsafe" Javascript in one tab without allowing it to access bank information in another tab, precisely because of sandboxing.

Be sure to head over to /r/learnpython if you have any questions or discussion related to the learning of python!
Try official tutorial at https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html But it may be little complex for the complete beginner.
I'm pretty sure such an implementation would be difficult because most standard I/O is done on a line by line basis.
This would be nice graphically view after the code has been written and run through some program that displays code like you have. Nice idea!
This is just your method of displaying a file, it doesn’t effect the code itself right? Therefore it’s just a UI implementation. Should be easy enough

Wow this is pretty surprising. I'm glad PSF are taking the major repos instead of individuals.
I guess I was thinking more along the lines of an organization vetting the code themselves. I heard something similar to this in R.
And this is a complete waste of valuable company resources (you). Edit: please read the full thing before voting As you get older, you'll start to get a better understanding of what companies and corporations are; and why you have a manager/project manager/scrum master in the first place. I don't mean this in a backhanded sense at all - more just to let you know that *yes* there is still a *little* bit to learn about the corporate world after college. :-) In your particular case, your salary is paid completely out of the recruitment fund, so it really doesn't matter if you waste clock cycles refactoring some old engineer's code to the latest standards. However, realize that you're probably wasting valuable engineering time that could have been spent on more pressing matters. Ask your manager for project work that will make the most impact to the company (and that they think that you can help with). Don't be afraid to be bold - and take on an entirely seperate challenge that you're very passionate about. If you don't succeed, so what, you can still show back a mastery of your understanding of said technologies. Everyone likes to learn from mistakes. /realworld
Whoa this is cool! Right on man. I just learned what modules are today too. Is this similar to Pip?
The comma is how one defines a single element tuple in python. It distinguishes it from using the parentheses for grouping.
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar
This script will basically execute pip install on any modules found in the script you provide as the input So if foo.py has: import foo import cow from fat import meow It will install all modules for you so you dont have to manually do them one by one
Don’t get me wrong I understand refactoring is a complete waste of time. It should have been written properly in the first place and not spaghetti code for summer intern to clean and modularize. That’s why everyday at work I’d dream of building my own startup and offer my own product. My output will ultimately be the responsibility of my input.
Awesome...thank you!!
a=(4) print (a) &amp;#x200B; 4 &amp;#x200B; what's the difference between (4,) and (4) ?
What you're describing is just *one* of the many reasons that a talented Engineer chooses to leave a high paying Fortune 100 company. And it's totally valid. I was more just trying to explain how you can get ahead in a environment like this.
The names of the libraries in the article: libpeshnx libpesh libari
I was tasked with refactoring and every time I try to nudge at fixing problems and moving the ball forward they tell me they’re not interesting in changing function from where it is and reiterate that I refactor and if I need help with their requirements. I’m calling this internship a lost cause, definitely don’t want to come back and it’s just for the name at this point. I just spend half of my time reading new technologies and Reddit.

You may want to ask r/learnpython, as that subreddit is generally where you ask questions. In short, a list stores references to objects whereas a NumPy array stores the number itself. Arrays are mostly used in mathematical functions, as vector operations can be performed on them. They are also much more efficient in regards to memory optimization and thus are generally faster. If you are dealing with mathematical models, such as those used with data analysis or machine learning, you will most likely be using NumPy arrays. Arrays are homogenous, meaning you can only store one data type in them. Lists, on the other hand, are containers for multiple types of data. They are heterogeneous, meaning you can story integers, strings, more lists, etc. in them. Here is an example. Say, you want to perform a mathematical operation on an array/list. &gt;&gt;&gt; lst = [1, 2, 3] &gt;&gt;&gt; lst/3 Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'list' and 'int' &gt;&gt;&gt; arr = numpy.array([1, 2, 3], float) &gt;&gt;&gt; arr/3 array([ 0.33, 0.67, 1. ]) While you can perform mathematical operations on an array, you cannot on a list. It is also worth noting that a NumPy array (numpy.ndarray) is not the same as an array from the array library (array.array) in Python.
Exactly.
a = (4) no comma will print 4. a = (4,) will print (4,) a tuple. This is similar to having (4,0) or (4,5) but instead of a number you have nothing. In python, to create a tuple you must give it at least two numbers. If you only want a tuple with one then you need to still separate that number with a comma, as in (4,). (4,) this pretty much means "I want a tuple but I only have one number. Make the second required number null" 😊
Saved - thanks!
I am looking to do something similar. If you use something like Bokeh, you don't need to host it on a server? Can you just have the data and html file located on a network drive and anyone can go in and open the file in their browser?

/r/learnpython is probably a better sub, but this kind of thing isn’t banned here. There are three important things about numpy arrays compared to lists. 1) They are efficient. The array is a chunk of memory that allows one to put a bunch of the same type into it. For example, a float64 holds a floating point number using 64 bits. When you have an array with, say, one thousand of these, it takes up 64,000 bits, plus a small amount extra to keep track of things like the size of the array and the fact that it holds float64 values. If you have a list of numbers in python, each element in the list could be replaced with an arbitrary python object, and so each number has to have some extra data storing information — so you have data that says “this is a floating point number” 1000 extra time. Plus, the actual location of the numbers in memory does not need to be contiguous—- they might be in random places throughout memory. This can make it cost a bit more time to loop through the numbers. Besides being memory efficient, the methods and functions in numpy are faster than coding the same thing in python — partly this is possible because it is easier to handle data that had such a structured form. It makes it simpler to code functions in C that are then called by python code. The structured nature of the data reduces the amount of internal data management that needs to be done when operating on a python object. 2) They handle multidimensional data nicely. Let’s say you have an image. If it is a black and white image, you could handle this with a list of lists, where the first element of the lust is a list that gives the brightness in the first row of pixels, the second element is another list for a second row. If you wanted to handle a color image, you could use a list of lists of lists, so that an inner list gives the red, green, and blue brightness factors. It’s possible— but cumbersome— to operate on a list of lists of lists. Your functions would need to do a lot of destructuring to locate and operate on the pieces of the image. Instead of nested lists, we can use a 2D numpy array or a 3D numpy array. The methods of the array make it easier to operate over each dimension we want. For example, it becomes much easier to figure out which pixel had the maximum brightness, or the average brightness over the image. 3) They have a lot of useful functionality in numpy, making a lot of common numerical tasks into one line commands. This makes numpy not only faster and more efficient at run time, but also faster to code with than pure python. The downside is that this strategy is only helpful when you have a lot of data with a very simple type — usually numbers, sometimes characters or boolean values— and you want to operate over that data as a collective set. It won’t help when you need to pick apart individual pieces of the data and manipulate them. Numpy is not an important tool to learn about if you want to build a web page or a game of hangman. It could help with some sub-problems, though. There are a lot of situations when numpy arrays are helpful though! A lot of the applications are related to math, science, and engineering, where one needs to perform a lot of mathematical operations on a lot of data.
I can suggest [this video lecture](https://youtu.be/V0D2mhVt7NE) as a brief intro.

I really hope he's okay. People giving everything away can be a sign of something very serious. If anyone has a personal connection please reach out just to be sure.
A tuple is an immutable list. (4,) creates a one element tuple. (4) is just the literal 4 in a parenthetical expression.

Depends on the amount of custom interactivity you want. The static html file will support a number convenient tools as well as custom JavaScript callback functions. If you don’t mind having all of the data in an html file, then bokeh will work great for you! Check out the docs and give it a try to see if it’ll work for your needs.
oh shoot I can't post it in reddit well
Thank yoouuu
Safe depends on what you’re trying to be safe from. Is it a problem if my open source code exec’s some code in order to allow for math functions? I guess you could use an ast parser to avoid it, but why? Because the user can inject code to something that already has a python command line?

Beware, some modules don't have exact same import name, for example: `python-telegram-bot` import is `import telegram`
Or worse - states.
NIIIIICE...
The native solution is much harder to use than json.net. We have to manually define how to serialize each type of custom object with JSONEncoder.
Good call. I can say from personal experience that the learning curve for Hadoop is non-trivial...

Try opening the script with IDLE which should be already installed and run the script you'll see the error stopping it from running

I think that after maybe the 3rd motivational quote they just become ‘quotes’
(4,) is a tuple with one element in it. (4) is just a 4
That would give me a cancer after an hour. Nice idea however.
My desktop is behind a window most of the time, so it doesn't really bother me :D
But projects are still being passed to different people in that ticket so...
Thanks for the advice, I am a high school student and this course isn’t going to be one that is for a career or a job, im just doing it as a hobby. They are doing a free trial class so I will go and see how serious they are and how much detail to go into but I doubt that I will enroll myself in this course. You guys are right its not enough time. That being said, do you know of any courses, resources or anything I can use to help my learn myself?
&gt;HTTP-over-QUIC Agreed. I thought the same exact thing when I first heard about it. [HTTP/3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3) is the only thing people should be calling HTTP3. This is right around the corner too.
I can only imagine. I used PyCharm for years, and at times it was that annoying to a fully sighted user. A lot of the features simply don’t know how to get out of the way, and for a natural minimalist I found I could never quite get it dialed in and “quiet”. All of the above are more or less “feature full”. PyCharm at least comes prepared for Python upfront, the rest all require configuration. That can be _fairly_ simple in VS: Code, which absent a bunch of plugins is more of a code editor out of the box than an IDE — they don’t want it competing with Visual Studio itself — it might be worth a look because of that less “features-forward” starting point, though. Configuration can be a quite time consuming process in both Eclipse and Netbeans. Though I’ve got to say of all of the above I remember Eclipse as the most keyboard-friendly overall.
Very nice! I have a similar project over at https://gitlab.com/Ningirama/Quoti
There shouldn't be a significant difference between Windows or Linux for this workload. A virtual machine however will always be slower than bare-metal. You could try to compile numpy for your specific CPU, which would allow for more aggressive optimisations by the C compiler, but that would probably waste more time than actually saving. Better profile and optimise your own code (as numpy is already pretty optimised) and make sure to use all your CPU cores. If you use multiprocessing, compare that to multithreading. Numpy releases the GIL during computations, so threads may be cheaper while still utilising multiple cores.
All of the 6 cores 12 threads on i7-8750H has already been 100% utilized in my script. In this case, will multithreading help？
I like it! I probably should point it out somewhere that I used Pyside2(qt for python)
We do a lot of GIS processing at work and the Linux machines run a lot faster than Windows. Even the Linux VM on my Windows 10 laptop can run the same code 2-3x faster.
Thanks for your reply. May I ask how large the data is your GIS processing code handling？ In my case do you think it is worth it to delete windows 10 and install Linux on my consumer level laptop？
How would you actually go about doing that? I wouldnt even know where to start
Integrate it with [this](https://gitlab.com/stemid/sex) and show a new sexy quote every time.
Some datasets are huge but we've implemented tiled processing so they don't need to load the whole thing in at once. The test suite has smaller data, a few vector features or tiff images up to a couple of megabytes, and it takes 10 minutes to run on Windows, 3 or 4 on Linux. It depends how Linux-savvy you are. I find developing on Windows is a pain but I like using a VM and having both OSes to hand.
Honestly I have 0 knowledge on Linux. But seeing how fast it can be when I run my script on Linux, I will start learning it from level 0 when I wake up tomorrow.
Thank you. Saved the thread.
Sounds like a VM is the best answer. Oracle VirtualBox is free and runs ok most of the time... Good luck!
I can’t believe all of those stars orbit the earth. Breathtaking.
Thanks u/ogrinfo. Do you think at some point I have to switch to Linux baremetal for squeezing out the maximized performance.
Don't confuse multithreading and multiprocessing. Threads should always be the first option, as they have significantly lower communication and memory overhead than processes. Only switch to processes (multiprocessing module) if you know that the GIL prevents you from utilising all CPUs. So, if you are currently using `multiprocessing.Pool` it might be worth comparing that to `multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool`.
Yep
Firstly, thank for your answer. Sadly, I can't really rely on such a solution since I would not be able to install LibreOffice on all PCs of my colleagues.
Is it linux? If yes, which desktop environment are you using?
my python script uses only multiprocessing.Pool to speed up for-loops and there is no communications between iterations. In this case, will multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool run faster than multiprocessing.Pool?
I couldn't say for sure. Our dedicated Linux machines are generally a higher spec, so it's not a fair comparison.
Install portaudio dev package(s).
In future I "may" have the chance to run the script on a higher spec pc with 64c/128t (about the fastest consumer-level cpu for workstation), in that case is running on VM Linux faster or baremetal Linux faster?
Of cause there is communication. The input if your parallelized function must be serialised and transferred to the worker process, and deserializes again. Same for the return value. Threads have shared memory, so this communication is basically free and nothing needs to be serialized. Starting a worker process is also very expensive (especially on windows).
Given Kenneth's recent track record of late, assuming there isn't something wrong in his personal life / mental health, this is a good thing.
so in other words, under the hood there is always a communication overhead in multiprocessing.Pool and little to no communication overhead in multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool? And for maximizing the performance I should always consider multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool instead of multiprocessing.Pool?
Celery and rabbit mq go hand in hand

Installing Python is not enough. You need additional modules (like Pygame). There is a README file with installation instructions. I think you should start there.
Why don't you scrape these quotes instead of hard coding them into a list? [http://quotes.toscrape.com/](http://quotes.toscrape.com/)
Yes, Linux. Distro is Kubuntu so it's KDE desktop environment.
Not always. If your job input and output are small (e.g. only a filename and the actual data is then loaded by the job) then the communication overhead is not a big issue. If you are limited by the GIL, then processes are the only way around it. But for most tasks which are IO bound and/or do most of their work in optimised C libraries, thread should be more lightweight. In the end, you have to understand the differences to make an educated guess, or simply measure to be sure. Both have their benefits and drawbacks.
Now do puppies!
I made this at 2 am in like 20 minutes so I haven't made anything special with it yet. Scraping is a good idea though.
The packages made no sense to begin with and are unlikely to have been downloaded by any developer with half a brain cell. These were packages that * didn't seem to be a misspelling of something popular * had no stated purpose * had no meaningful google results except for libari, but that still doesn't make sense and that package was one that wasn't running the backdoor
my script iterates different combinations of parameters(say n1 is from 1 to 2000, n2 is 0.1 to 2.0), each combination transforms the given NumPy array input(the input is a 5MB Numpy array) into 9 to 10 intermediate arrays and then transform these 9 to 10 intermediate arrays into a tuple and a float. \&gt; If you are limited by the GIL, then processes are the only way around it Since my script will benefit greatly from unlocking the GIL, I should simply stick to multiprocessing.Pool and call it a day then?
This. You might end up installing a completely different module with all its dependencies if you just pip install the module name. Quite risky. Also does it distinguish between local libraries and external libraries?
It's probably going to be renamed to httpx or hyper
Don't run pip. Generate requirements.txt file.
I see this as similar to Guido "giving python away". It's not as if Guido now has nothing to do with Python or CPython's development, he's just stopped being the sole person the buck stops at for that project. I'd guess kenneth wants some time to regroup and so wants to enable the same thing for most of his popular repo's.
Requests has been largely keeping going under others' steam for years now. This is just transferring technical project ownership rights. Honestly that's a good sign of a healthy project, because kenneth is (in general) increasing the [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) for this and his other projects.
1) Did you use a Generative Adversarial Neural Network? 2) That’s really cool - if I could guild your post, I would.
Tbh, all depends on platform. Now I'd suggest to start with official python downloads, it's way better lately. For mac – "everything is broken". The only sane way (IMO) is to first install brew, and than install python with it
My point was that it’s misleading newbies. Euclidean isn’t *the* distance measure, it’s *a* distance measure.
Awesome work. Code is full of Love :D
Use template engine (Jinja2, Mako etc). It's the easiest way to generate long(er) messages. If you store the templates as separate files, you can change them without messing with the code.
Nice opportunity for someone to publish evil packages with these shorter import names. Bonus points if they successfully hide this by wrapping the intended package.
Unsupervised automatic installation and running setup for privileged code like Python is probably not a great idea.
Thanks it means a lot to me!

Writing a base template that can be used to crawl and scrape the desired url for desired info. Sick of writing a new scraper each time ;)
If you assume pi is infinite and non-repeating, people often say things like "every number combination is in there. But think about it this way. Take every time the number 5 appears in pi, and replace the 5 with a 2. Not it's still infinite and non-repeating, but there's no fives in there at all. So definitely not every number combination. Now this is a massive oversimplification and not exactly mathematical but is something that illustrated the point well when I heard it.

You changed r in the function Question, that doesn't automatically change r in other locations. Instead have Question return True or False and assign r = Question() instead of doing Question(r).
Damn that is some next level shit 😍
Would suggest to get a VPS (virtual private server from Linode) for \~5 dollars/month, running arch linux and you install there with everything you need.
&gt; Since my script will benefit greatly from unlocking the GIL Why are you so sure about that? If your script spents most of its time within numpy methods, then no, the GIL is not an issue because numpy releases the GIL during computations.
Why hallucinations?
2 minutes is too little. It should be three hours. Or one hour.
Because i have two versions of the script； with/without multiprocessing. I benchmarked my script before, the result was that the one multiprocessing loops 6 times faster than the script without multiprocessing. Also, since during the script‘s run time the cpu utilization on my pc is always 100%(my script takes about 9400 seconds to run 1,200,000 iterations, only the first 8 seconds and the last 4 seconds in the total 9400secs have low cpu utilization)
What does http3 do that requests does not?
Probably because the AI generated them.

Yeah probably best to stick to requests with that attitude
Probably yeah

Awesome. Just what I needed
CSP's are very hard to come up with generic solutions for. A lot of them are modeled as path finding through graphs. One site to look at is http://www.csplib.org/ which has collection of benchmark CSP's to test against. All of the data sets are different formats and this will give you an idea of how difficult your problem is. Good look with your work.
It was a question. Not an attitude. I am more than happy to try out http3. However, from reading their website the benefits are unclear.

I’m curious when I see cool projects like this: Did you start this from complete scratch or did you have this idea and use a template and then tweak that template? I always kind of feel kinda weird when I start a project sometimes and I initially copy a boatload of code and then start understanding it and tweaking it to do what I want.
Thanks. But it doesn't look mature enough for use in Python beginner courses.
My two cents - quick and dirty, get something done: copy and paste templates and do your best to understand along the way. learning/maintainable project: break it into small pieces, get them up and running in a way that is easily understandable when reading the code so that if you (or someone else) needs to revisit the code for any reason, it doesn't take ages to get back up to speed on whatever the hell it was you wrote the first time around.
You should definitely use either requests or http3 in your courses over urllib
OP posted the GitHub, it is indeed a DCGAN
Something like https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle That was the top Google result for "python object graph serialisation". There will be lots of good python libraries for this, all you need is the right search terms

If you're not constrained to PyAudio perse, you will likely have an easier experience by trying some of the more modern alternatives such as \`\`soundcard\`\` or the \`\`miniaudio\`\` libraries. (disclaimer; \`\`miniaudio\`\` is my wrapper library for the miniaudio C library. It is included in the setup and has no external dependencies.)

As I understand it, the PSF org isn't automatically providing developers or even governance, just administrative support. So the repos are probably going under the PSF umbrella, but they'll be run and developed primari by others; the PSF will just act as a backstop to make sure they can stay alive if that person disappears.
I'd rather have an application that kicks me in the crotch every two minutes.
This is for when someone gives you a script and doesnt provide you a requirements.txt
Hmm thats interesting. Maybe I should be breaking my projects into smaller pieces? I’ve been working a lot of projects for my resume and a lot of times I just start with a template of a project that’s already been done on the thing I want to do and then I go through and comment and understand what the code actually does and tweak it to my liking to have it output something different and apply it in a different way
I'll be checking out these videos. Machine learning is an interest of mine, but I only have basic python skills. Thank you for the time and effort you put into these videos.

what distro is this?
Use lots of online resources like stackoverflow and the python subreddits when you need help with your code and don’t stop codeína for like a month or two at a time, you’ll forget stuff pretty quick
Kubuntu
You can use PIP and a script that run those pip commands under condition. Try to write a bash script that launch a pip command only if X is installed OR Y is installed. You can check dependencies with: $ pip 'depname' show and it will show you informations about that dependence. &amp;#x200B; I hope you are working on linux, it's easier than win
Yes, I know. Instead of installing modules, generate requirements.txt file and let the user decide how to run pip, with what options, locally or globally etc. Some users even would want to **not** run pip and use system packages instead (for automatic updates), taking requirements.txt as a reference. Automatic invasive actions should be minimized.
Python 3.8 is adding audit hooks: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0578/ Basically, it raises an 'event' whenever certain potentially risky APIs are used. It's not a complete solution, but it should at least make it more obvious when a math library starts listening for network requests.
We've got a city to burn.
That's how you start coding, start small and dirty and undirty things as you go, otherwise you'll never get anywhere.

GANs (networks that generate images similar to a set of source images) are very popular and evolving fast to useful applications right now (see the popularity of Faceapp for example). You can go and download a DCGAN architecture and train it on any set of images you want pretty quickly these days. I'm not sure if OP messed with the architecture at all or not, haven't checked out the code.
I started with a template DCGAN from a keras example page. Then trained it to my liking. It only creates one image at a time so then I had to scale it massively
Very cool, but "hallucinations of a neural network" is [Refik Anadol's term for his GAN artwork](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz7YNJTFXGN/?igshid=1a7yfenu47xy0) which this work is clearly inspired by. May wanna find your own term

A couple things I'm aware of: * Dlint can find function calls that are insecure specifically because of a kwarg. E.g. it will detect `subprocess` calls with `shell=True`, but ignores them if the kwarg isn't truthy. * Dlint can find method calls on an object. E.g. instantiating `TarFile` to a variable, then calling `extractall` on that variable. [TarFile.extractall](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile.TarFile.extractall) My longer term vision for Dlint includes things like taint analysis and other more advanced static analysis features.

It gets even weirder. Pypi and Anaconda sometimes name things differently. You install pyqt5 with pyqt5 on pypi, but PyQt=5 on Anaconda. It’s also single equals instead of double equals because reasons.

Once you have implemented scraping methods, you should look at using supervisor and systemctl to run the script as a service.

What were the libraries pretending to be. There was no documentation so I doubt anyone was pip installing them. Were the libraries dependencies for any other legit packages. As for downloads I doubt the number is accurate. That would incude mirrors pulling stuff, not just users installing. Is there any evidence anyone was actually compromised.
Yeah, good way to learning something new. I learnt go by doing this. Just keep doing my daily job, just using another language.
Yes
How do I save these to read later?
This is incredibly helpful, thank you!

Thank you!
Very interesting article, but as you said the vulnerabilities are in the CPU. I wouldn't blame C though, when it was created that's how the architecture looked and behaved like that. When improving CPU design architects found more efficient ways to do specifically tasks and then abstracted it all away to let existing languages use that. What author suggested sounds great, but as far as I know there is still no language that could replace C, provide low level control (which you absolutely need if you are doing OS programming) and directly utilize the CPU architecture. As author pointed out there is also no way to disable that. Anyway we were talking about vulnerability in the language, and the article proves my point, it is a great read though. As for your last argument, if someone is unwilling to update openssl due to vulnerability, then Python EOL is irrelevant as well, since they most likely won't update Python either. BTW: when heartbleed happened Python did not have to release any fix, their code wasn't broken.
You become the expert on the things you work on. I've been doing backend web programming in Python for over 10 years and wouldn't have the first idea about where to start with a 2D RPG. Definitely come back and share your project at some point!
Dude wtf,I was in dire need for data manipulation articles or tutorials just few minutes earlier and now I stumble upon this????!!! I have no idea how to thank you. anyway thank you very much :)
Hehe, awesome!
Dead code typically includes more than just code that is commented out. Code that can't be reached, will never execute, etc is also dead code (for instance, code after an unconditional call to exit in main). This ONLY finds commented out code. Might want to note that as it is a bit confusing.
This is great stuff, thanks for sharing!
Thank you!
wow shit you're not kidding, good call. thanks for the suggestion. what other interesting sensors and devices can you integrate with python?
I haven’t touched anything like this in two years so take anything I say with a grain of salt. i2c is a reasonably well accepted sensor communication protocol which is pretty simple to understand in a comprehensive way and use in python. I used it for a project when I was a sophomore in high school so nothing too hard. Additionally, some sensors simply use a variable voltage output that has to be translated (normally temperature probes and the like.) For my project I chose to stick with i2c because it kept it easy and simple. Best of luck, and please hit me if you have more questions!
as a highly intelligent programmer I use Decanter ^(/s)
Ah, thanks a lot. That paints a very clear picture of where I need to do some research. Sometimes the toughest part about this stuff is knowing what to google! I'm going to do a little studying and see where I can get on my own, but I'll make sure to get in touch with questions. again, thanks a ton!
Every article like this always ends with “it depends” or “they are both great”.

anyone knows the story behind [tabulate](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/) ? I don't see any attribution to Ken.
huh "states" ?
Thanks! I'll check it out!
He means nations
You’ll want to do some reading about how decision trees work (how they’re fit and how they predict). For this time series application you’re basically extrapolating using a range of values the model hasn’t seen before. In general that’s bad, but time series has its own field of study and best practices. I’d recommend googling boosted trees for time series.
Honestly if you want something beginner friendly without needing a 3rd party library you can probably write a page's worth of wrapper code around urllib that will be 80% as good as requests' API and work with 90% of sites (especially curated ones they want to fetch). Would work fine for getting started.

This is actually awesome👌...more coffee to you brother
/r/learnpython &amp;#x200B; /thread
Well, that's the first issue. The second issue, is that with the logic in \`setup.py\` I can't modify the list of requirements conditional on one of them failing to install. &amp;#x200B; I could do so by running a sub-command that calls pip locally to install the package, but that's less than ideal.
The x axis paremeter is time but it is not a time series problem. The application is not on real-time data, but the model is unable to predict outside the range of x values (0-100) which it has already learned. Any value predicted for an x, outside this range, gives an output of y when x=100. However the model has learned up to x=100.
Matplotlib has 3d plotting functionality
That's what I'd have done if I only had to support linux... but windows environments are weird and I'm not sure I can get pip to work similarly on them. &amp;#x200B; That's the best solution I have at the moment though, and the one I'll go with unless I find something better.
I love you man, thank you!
Star if it helps you!
Much appreciated!

How did you export the tables in markdown? I know how to do similar in .Rmd files in R, but haven’t seen an easy way in python.
TLDR; (1) Are you using the Django ORM with a standard relational database? Yes - use Django No - use Flask (or some other framework) Don't let the debate go further than that. Better? :)
I actually did them by hand, but it can be done with a bit of string formatting and using df.iterrows() in a for loop. I do that for a Reddit bot that manages a Markdown table.
Why?
to increase activity on our discord server and to inspire creativity, as well as give people a way to practice code.
No kidding setup is the barrier. Everything has to be exactly the right version or it won't work. Good luck!
starting to learn tensorflow.gotta admit, this sub is full of heroes :D
This pretty awesome. It's helping me wrap my head a little more around pandas and dataframes than I've been able to before. Not quite halfway through it yet though. &amp;#x200B; I did catch one small spelling error in the code: `both_df = df.pivot_table(index="name", columns="gender",` **alues="count"**`, aggfunc=np.sum).dropna()` Should be ***v****alues="count"*.
Hmm I had heard terrible things about it but trying it out its actually decent.

I definitely need to do the same for Udemy, thanks for the tip. I like Codecademy, it tells you when you're wrong and gives you hints. But Python 3 is behind their paywall :/ (py2 is free however) But that was the site that seemed to just skim over `if{} else if{} else{}` statements.
Ah yes, I started reading through that. Not sure why I stopped for edX lol. Thanks

[You're right](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/5sm6zm/using_virtualenv_is_more_secure/)! I was under a false impression. In that case the only way to be sure you're safe is to use trusted packages and do some research before downloading stuff. Or use a VM.

[https://github.com/ad-m/python-anticaptcha](https://github.com/ad-m/python-anticaptcha) can you clearly say what is the problem to use selenium and api of 2captcha\\anticaptcha? what you can't do?
I would say, consider: * The technical needs of the project at hand (Are you better off using/adapting a "foundation" codebase to build on or can you do with rolling your own (light) solution? If A, go with Django; else roll with Flask) * Your technical chops: (Are you a beginner or mid-level programmer who is still trying to understand all the nitty gritty of web development? Then, go with Django as it gives you a deep dive into concepts you already know about and introduces you to other areas you should know about. If you a senior dev, why not take your wealth of experience and skills and roll your own solution with a "barebones" framework like Flask. AKA: Bones supplied, bring your own meat.) * Personal Preference. At the end of the day (and beyond ideas of "batteries included" and "light and flexible"), if you know what you are doing, go with your (geek) guts. :)
Basically I don't understand how to use it at all. I have selenium navigate to the site with the recaptcha, but then what? How do I send the site key to 2captcha and then how do I complete the Captcha once they send me the solution?
Interesting to note that everything is trending downwards in general. I'm not sure whether this means we are using newer names or or that in general pppulation growth aka new baby name registration itself has slowed down.
I am simply trying to take some rows of data and put them into columns from one csv to another. This is to see who can work/view an outage. Dispatch employees can view outages and crew can work them. A few can do both. The original is formatted: Human Name: Dispatch Employee Name: Dispatch Crew Name: The column headers in the new csv are: User, view, work, district I know this is probably very simple for someone well versed in python, but that is not me. I’m having fun with the challenge and learning though. So far I can make the original into a list &amp; write the correct column headings to a new csv. If anyone can help or point me in the right direction, I’d appreciate it.
You've already posted this 24 times earlier. 8 months ago, and then 7 months ago. please stop?
firstly - documentation [https://anticaptcha.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/API/pages/196635/Documentation+in+English](https://anticaptcha.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/API/pages/196635/Documentation+in+English) second - look at example [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51034252/integrating-anticaptcha-with-selenium](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51034252/integrating-anticaptcha-with-selenium)
Is the formatting off or is newlist on the first line?
This is worth a GitHub star.
Well, if i finish it i will consider sharing it with more people than my friends and family
Good content man! Keep it up!
&gt; The packages made no sense to begin with TBH, I think that's besides the point. There have been several node.js incidents but [this one in particular](https://www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/hacker-takes-over-javascript-library-injects-malware-to-steal-bitcoin/) is interesting because a widely used library (in payment systems among many uses) was taken over by a malicious developer. Also [this one](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3214624/malicious-code-in-the-node-js-npm-registry-shakes-open-source-trust-model.html) which seems more like the one in this thread. The issue is whether there is a reliable process to discover malicious packages in a timely fashion.
You need to revise your knowledge of lists in python. You should be using list.append(i) and not list = list + [i]. Other improvements could be avoiding convoluted coding like int(input(...)). Break things up for the sake of readability. Finally, learn about other ways of creating lists such as: [ i for i in range(2,100)] // [2,3,4,5,...,99] or [ x for x in iterabble if x someCondition] These are some ideas. 😉
Nice! Some room for improvement: Technical: you use `df[condition][column]` which creates a view, where changes aren't retained. Using `df.loc[condition, column]` instead prevents this. Conceptual: Wouldn't a name's relative occurrence be more meaningful? Easily implemented by dividing all the counts by the total number of names per year. Out of interest: assuming the m/f name distribution is constant and equal, you should be able to find the ratio of names that occur &lt;5 times.
I just checked 3 random links from the GitHub page and they worked for me
Thank you for the feedback! 1. I need to work on this bad habit, I will update all the ocurrences where that happens. 2. I actually did that for a pie chart, I had a variable of total overall and calculated the percentage of all names and sorted it. Most of the top 10 where in the range of 1.0-0.8% but then I dropped the idea. 3. That would be pretty interesting to know.
I do the same, but as others have said, some package down the dependency tree may still pull in something it shouldn't.
&gt;There are likely thousands So how do we deal with this, what can we do?
For relative occurrence, I mean over the years, so instead of the absolute number of name X each year, the percentage of name X each year. Then you'd see the changes in a name's popularity without wars and baby booms muddying the signal.
I am working on PyQt5 and pyqtgraph based GUI for a 1D Hydraulic River Modelling Program written and developed since the 1990s. Up until now all the input to the program was a bunch of unstructured ascii data, which required a lot of training for users. The GUI can read/write/edit/view/run the model and visualize the results far efficiently. I started working on the project 3 months ago and I am honestly surprised how far I have come along as I have no background in programming and I learned python at work one year ago just googling and going through the docs. The project is on github as: https://github.com/sharon92/Hydret1D-GUI And I am packaging the program into executable and distributing via installers. My current struggle is to be able to send automatic updates to the program via cloud. But I guess I will figure it out.
I got you now. I actually wanted to know the effect of wars on the population. But what you described is correct, I should hsve used growth ratios.
PyQt5 is well documented, and use Qt designer for saving tons of hours.
I look forward to hearing from your guys
For the glory of satan

Connect with telnet to your SMTP server (port 25 by default) and send this (one line at a time): EHLO your-host-name MAIL FROM: &lt;your-email&gt; RCPT TO: &lt;your-email&gt; DATA From: &lt;your-email&gt; To: &lt;your-email&gt; Subject: Test This is a test .

I am working with some friends to write a differential equation solution plotter. The project is inspired by similar projects such as [pplane and dfield](https://math.rice.edu/~dfield/dfpp.html). We hope to implement some of the functionality of these other projects, and to add some of our own features.
Yo thanks!!!
That’s what I figured when I was doing my initial research. I feel like a lot of libraries and frameworks just take a week to get the hang of and then you’re off to the races.
Other than Pycharm, I used only VS Code. What I like about PyCharm respect to VSC is mostly the debugger (in particular the DataFrame view). Also sometimes I found the VSC autocompletition very slow, and it was very annoying for me.
I'm following through using iPython, and the one liners keep giving me a KeyError: 'gender' I'm at a loss why.
Wow this is awesome, thanks!
Can you please tell me which line gives this error?
 df[df["gender"] == "M"][["name", "count"]].groupby("name").sum().sort_values("count", ascending=False).head(10) It's not the code, I needed to go back and reload the data. Still learning this darned thing.
Ohh, good! If you like IPython you will love Jupyter Notebooks. The basic concept is similar but way better.
Cheers - I'll give it a go.
This has been illuminating! &amp;#x200B; If I try to Telnet into the machine from the webserver it first tries to connect to an IPv6 address, which fails. It then eventually connects to the IPv4 IP, but it seems to take a very long time to do so. &amp;#x200B; If I try to Telnet into it from my local Ubuntu 16.04 machine it tries the IPv4 address first! This might be why I'm not seeing any problems in my local tests. &amp;#x200B; I tried removing the IPv6 entry for mail from the domain's DNS... and it worked! &amp;#x200B; I wonder why that machine started prioritizing the IPv6 address, when it obviously had to have been using the IPv4 address for all of the months that it was working. &amp;#x200B; Thanks you very much for giving me the clue that got me to the solution! I'm so glad to have this solved before the weekend.
Is there some reason it isn't a pip package itself?

You can become fairly decent with that kind of commitment, the only issue is that you are learning without the interactions that others may get from working on a team. Overall you will still be an entry level developer. You will also want to take time learning logic, the software delivery cycle, common libraries for the language, clean coding practices, and debugging procedures.
So it basically organizes all the crap I’ve written into a packable structure, saving me a headache every time I have to do it? Thanks man! That’s what I needed.
It's a plan for the future :)
thank you kind sir
so yeah if I'm able to spend 30 hours a week, how many weeks will it take to learn enough to be ready for entry level? Thanks
I'm glad I could help :) This however: &gt; It then eventually connects to the IPv4 IP, but it seems to take a very long time to do so. is still worrying. It may mean SMTP server has or had problems resolving your IP to name. Make sure it's OK now for every connection. SMTP server logs may provide more information. &gt; I wonder why that machine started prioritizing the IPv6 address It depends on what DNS server returns as first record. It probably was returning IPv4 first before. Disabling IPv6 on the web server should make you immune to IPv6 DNS records. Have a nice weekend! :)

I like the library Plumbum for this. You can use it to write shell script-like programs in Python pretty easily. https://plumbum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
Huh
Nice

I’ll approach from a different direction because removing PII automatically can be very error prone: can you get the data without PII to begin with? If not, do you really need to remove PII or can you store and grant access to your data according to the relevant laws? Does your data have enough structure that you can build a simple tool that removes PII from just your data?
I think it can be done this way: \- extract audio stream from file \- if needed, apply some eq filter to increase voice level and drown out the noise level. \- detect silences and split audio file by it. \- download [https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) and try to get text from audio parts. \- combine audio timestamps and recognized text to get complete video subtitles. \- now develop video player, that can fts (full text search) over the all of you videos subtitles and jump to position.
That's actually a really great way to summarize it- added to the original post!
I'd also add that the original data variable `df` is overwritten a few times, but as the notebook progresses, one will need the original values. Maybe the `pd.read_csv("data.csv")` should be store in a separate variable.
I'm currently working with emails, and just a test dataset for now. But yes, I'm assuming I would have the necessary access required to work with email contents once implemented in production. At the proof of concept stage at the moment, and was wondering how feasible it would be to remove personal data, specifically data which is more structured like credit cards number as opposed to names and the like. Not the biggest issue if it isn't feasible

Hiya, &amp;#x200B; Try defining the function BEFORE this line: &amp;#x200B; `take_pic_btn.when_pressed= take_picture`
Ive tried that but when i run the code it doesn't display any status
Anywhere from a month or so to never.
But that fixes the above error, correct? &amp;#x200B; So, now, you have a new problem. What happens when you run the code? &amp;#x200B; Unfortuantely, I don't have a Pi, so I can't test the code myself.
Define proficient. There are so many different ways to use python. What problems are you trying to solve. Think about what industry you want to get into. Research how they’re using python.
Your it.chain statement simply “chains” together those ranges and iterates over them so your for loop is essentially just for i in range(4*c) which is why you have that range error
thanks for sharing!
yes that problem was fixed but now it sends me back to the main screen. im getting the code from an outdated tutorial and it's code was giving me these errors.
Try r/learnpython
Wow it must work well :)
Another indev project of mine is built and updated with this :) https://github.com/caseyjohnsonwv/sheetslib
These articles never state one thing. How do you write tests that roll back the DB transaction at the end of each test. Without this, the previous test will pollute the db with data for the next test, making it hard to write reliable tests. This is exactly why I choose Django, I am sick of having to roll my own transaction rollback test framework in a project where the author has chosen Flask, Pyramid, Bottle, etc. Real life experience.
I have another one to add to that: Do you want to write tests, and insert data into the database in a test, then roll it back before the next test runs? Yes - use Django
A real life experience: Recently I had to take over a bottle.py project (yes, Bottle in 2019, yikes!). The tests were not reliable at all because there was random committing going on of the SQLAlchemy db session everywhere, depending what order you ran the tests you would get a different outcome. Also execution order of tests is pretty random, it isn't guaranteed. The tests hadn't run for a couple of years because of they were so broken (they do now because of me) This isn't the first project I've had to deal with such an issue, I've had to deal with this exact same pain point with Pyramid projects too, Flask projects would be the same. With Django you don't have to worry about this because the built-in test framework as well as test app (self.client in test cases) handles transction rollback for you. I ended up having to write my own TransactionTestCase base class, because the application was using bottle-sqlalchemy I had to monkey-patch the commit method and replace it with flush because every time it was using webtest it would commit at the end of the route. I also noticed the test client (webtest) was starting a new db session, so any objects I put into the db_session in the tests setUp method were not seen by the webtest app. I dealt with this by feeding the db_session started by the test case to the webtest app so it would be a shared session. This is a huge pain in the ass to have to implement each time, that is why you should just use Django imho.

Hey there, questions like "how long will it take me to..." and "will I be able to find a job if..." are not very easy to answer. Nobody knows how well you are at studying (but you). Also as it was already mentioned, python is a very broad topic, do you want to make web apps, games, APIs, ... ? Different language applications means different parallel technologies, that you would need to learn, cause you are likely to need more than just python to be useful. Just my 2¢.
*laughs in Baader-Meinhoff*
wow really awesome !
Here is an example of a user asking this exact question, it goes unanswered because the solution is never simple and requires mocking/monkey patching: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46240486/run-flask-tests-within-a-transaction That is why you should just use Django.
Can this be done using cellphone number??
Thanks. I will look into those engines
Cool dude!
Fiddling around with CanaryMod and raspberry fruit juice to automate Minecraft builds and such. So far so good!

Yes, notice the example. Each carrier has an address to use. Verizon has @vtext.com etc. But you do need to know the carrier for this. If you dont know it, use twilio!
I'm working on an EMF package for electrical engineers and physicists. So far, I've created a lot of math and coordinate conversion functions. It's been a lot of fun
New link?
Well, that made me uncomfortable...
Lmao Streisand Effect. I wasn't going to get it but now that silicon valley has declared war on it I found a version of it being rebuilt, and now I have the "evil" application that's worse than photoshop
/r/learnpython
Yes
Chaquopy is my personal favorite
I use VTK. It’s got a bit of a learning curve, but it makes gorgeous plots and the mouse control and speed is great, even for huge models.
You're welcome. &amp;#x200B; I'm not sure what to tell you at this point - you need to describe what is going on better. What does "it sends me back to the main screen" mean? Do you have a link to the tutorial you're following?
&gt; min-height 90vh This worked, you magnificent person
Sounds like you're looking for client side stuff, and so far as I know nobody has bundled something like that into python templates. If you want a modern webapp, you're gonna have to learn JavaScript. Do a react tutorial and you'll know enough to be dangerous in two weeks, honestly.
Depends on the library and how you use it. Requests can do both... get() is a new session each time, but you can create a Session object and get state maintained.
Looks great, I'll try it out, thanks
How did you go about combining plots into the graphic? I can't see any code for this.
Awesome! Wish there were resources like this when I was in college
This. The consideration is really where you are bottlenecked. If you run it and your cpu is less then 100%, you should consider splitting it for disk IO. If you're running at one core at 100%, multuprocessing may be the answer. You can do multuprocessing with one process reading and sending data down the pipe for processing, or split the file itself and have each process read from disk. Threads let you pass data back and forth much more easily (no serialization!), but can only run one thing at a time. You could even drop down to c code and manage everything manually to get the absolute best performance. Depends on how much time you have to spend haha. I usually try it sequential first, then with a thread pool, then with a mp pool. Usually one of those will be good enough and it's not worth the time to go further.
Oddly enough, I prefer reading the two paragraphs. Javadoc usually has every option and param...usually with absolutely no explanation of what they do. I agree the python core docs are not very easy to use, especially for something like "how do I inherit from a dict" or "what are the parameters of metaclasses". There is definitely not another full set floating around though.
You could save them to image files? Probably better to just use JavaScript for interactivity. D3 for example is very powerful and can still get going quickly.
For that I used Adobe Fireworks but it is possible to do it with Matplotlib. https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplot.html
Yes indeed on the subplots bit. I was hoping you found a magical unicorn package for infographics! Personally I hack mine together with PIL if I need to it be reproducible, or an editor if I don't.
Taken from the 7-zip website: "For ZIP and GZIP formats, **7-Zip** provides a compression ratio that is 2-10 % better than the ratio provided by PKZip and WinZip", this turns out to be quite true, I find it quite hard to beat 7-zip's compression levels compared to the gzip standard library. With their slightly smaller file sizes it is usually slower, generally an always applicable rule in compression is that if it is able to make the file smaller it generally takes longer; thus my application turns out to be slightly faster in general. &amp;#x200B; This application has been compiled into executable form and I am thinking of making it public, I tested it on several Windows machines (only works on Windows at the moment). As for making it free/open source I really would like to capitalize from something I put a lot of work into, but making it free would definitely make it more appealing to use. Still indecisive about the licensing.
Definitely linux
currently doing something similar. Yes it can be automated, but having hand written data might complicate things. Get more info from your job about workflow and details about your task. then you can come up with which task you're going to start with. Might want to look into OCR if you're digitizing printed information.
You Are A God
Thank you, kind sir!
A better question is: Has Anyone Really Been Far Even as Decided to Use Even Go Want to do Look More Like?
Thanks for your input, but why would I download the Linux OS when I can just keep Windows 10? I have an text editor(Geany).....
You can have both downloaded at the same time, and it's much more developer friendly.
I'm trying to calibrate a O3 sensor, making the relation from Voltage to Particles of Ozone, comparing the Voltage values with other reference values on a neural network... But, I don't know how to use a neural network, so i'm not having any kind of progress. [Btw, the repo is here](https://github.com/thblckjkr/neurO3)
For some of these simple conditional slicing, it's often better to use the \[\`query\`\]([https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.query.html](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.query.html)) dataframe method. It makes slicing more compact and IMO easier to read. &amp;#x200B; The following will return the subset of all female names from the years before 1900 where the count is greater than the mean of all counts. Using the default slicing makes this a bit trickier &amp;#x200B; \`\`\`python df.query("gender == 'F' and year &lt; 1900 and count &gt; count.mean()") \`\`\`
Hey, are you still having the issue? It's been a few hours now. Dunno how the module you're using works but it looks like you call the function in "take_pic_btn.when_pressed= take_picture" If that's the case, try making it "= take_picture()"
https://beeware.org looks pretty good. Builds for many platforms and provides sample projects.
Why use .chain and not .product?
This is awesome. Thank you!
My experience with Azure Cognitive Service in Python was decent, but I still prefer Google Cloud Service.
Hasn't Fireworks been dead for years? I just got flashbacks of slicing and testing in Dreamweaver
Why are you using csvwriter and split on your txt rather than parse it directly with pandas.read_csv?
Use Windows 10 - download pycharm community edition I have started python half a year ago. Pycharm will help you alot. It can make virtial environments easy. Combine with git and also help you write code better looking. You can alsobuse Ubuntu for windows. It is available in the microsoft store. I would advise you to get comfortable also with the basic linux command line atleast. It will be very usefull longterm.
Your readme is in the wrong place I think. [https://github.com/Jabrils/Uncle-Rober-Baseball-Predictor/tree/master/SDEC%20(Init)](https://github.com/Jabrils/Uncle-Rober-Baseball-Predictor/tree/master/SDEC%20(Init))
Appreciate it.
There might be some unicode formated strings somewhere in there, which is why its giving you the pains. Try decoding your source code in an online unicode decoder/encoder and running it again. It should work upon decoding if that's the case.
Forget this discord group. It's a pain, everyone needs to invite five new members before he gets access which is why the thread is spammed with links. Just go to youtube instead, look for "deepnude" and hit the first video. The download links are in the description. &amp;#x200B; But to be honest: The app does not nearly work as well as they want us to think it does. Of course you are curious now, but you will be disappointed.

Yes, 1000 individual calls to plot will take a long time
Thanks. Is there any way I can do to make it faster?
That won't be a 1 minuted and 23 seconds run time. Hahaha
Something I feel a lot of new people miss: error checking. Be sure you understand how to incorporate this into your scripts.

This can help you investigate what’s taking time: https://docs.python.org/2/library/profile.html
For us power user, what keeps me happy and concentrated while writing python 8 hours a day is the fact that it strikes the right balance between easy and fun. Walrus is fun, list comprehensions are fun. If you need a language where you only have if, for, assign a variable and very, very little more, Go has been designed precisely that way. And I find Go one of the most boring language ever and I’d hate being forced to only write slightly different variations of the same if / for loop all day long.
You are inspiring me. Thankyou
I’m also very excited by Math I Squirt.
You can shave a little time by initializing your Lists with the expected size. You’re using numpy, so use https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.empty.html. Appending to a List will eventually cause the list to grow, which involves a memory allocation and copying every item in the original list.
It wouldn't surprise me.
I’m going to guess that asking numpy to generate a List of random numbers for you is faster than creating one at a time. Try using np.random.randint(low=1, high=1000, size=1000). The size is the size of the List you want.
Thanks. I tried that and now it takes 55s...well a lot better.
I am wondering if there is still something I can do to make it better though.. My friend who is using Matlab got it plotted less than a second...
Drop the lists and first for loop. Then pass the random straight to the plot function. The lists there have no use it just slows you and accumulate things in memory for nothing.
You can remove the 2000 append calls by using list comprehensions to initialize the two lists.
Unless you're doing intense processing on larger data sets, you're completely fine with what you have already. You can easily do significant amounts of python development on a raspberry pi if you wanted. Finding projects is the thing to do. Want to do data analytics? Machine learning? Computer vision? Web services? Games? Home automation/robotics? Network security? Something else? A programming language is ultimately just a tool to build stuff. The best way to learn is by doing, and the best way to get motivated to do something is to have a problem you really want to solve. The recommendation for PyCharm is excellent, I have a professional license and it's all I use when I'm doing anything more formal than throwaway code. Like, I built something along the lines of an agent based warehouse simulation, moving stuff around, shipping it various places, introducing errors, etc, all in PyCharm. JetBrains makes great tools. I use Sublime Text 3 for most of my more throwaway stuff, it's easy to get nice syntax highlighting, etc. Atom is another good option. Linux is a lot of fun, and it's worth learning about too, but it might be easier to keep it to one thing at a time. The best thing about linux/unixes in my book is significantly better unicode support without a lot of headaches, but that only actually matters if you're doing stuff with human languages with different writing systems.
Also, before the final loop, you could cache the plot instance, eg. plot = pl.plot. Then, in the loop reference the cache variable, thereby bypassing the dynamic lookup of the method on each iteration.
Random number generation is expensive.You could set a 1000,1000 shape on your call to rand, to get back a 2d array?
Second working in Pycharm. I am now using Pycharm professional because of the Jupyter support. Yes Jupyter can installed separately for free but the integration is nice. Unless you are using a dedicated machine to avoid distractions you might as program on your laptop.
I use these tools at work to automate stuff: Selenium + pandas + pyrobogui ( https://github.com/ClimenteA/pyrobogui )
Thanks
I have no idea what you are doing, but at least there’ a missing parenthesis after `(Taxable_Income - 423300)` (that’s line 9 in you excerpt).

YouTube link ain't working
I have always found just coding in it helps like if you know matlab at all maybe try to write some matlab functions or code you have into python. I feel there is really no other way to get better aquainted with a language then having to deal with it.
On my device it's working 🤔
Put vary simply its cannot learn something it has never dealt with before. Its the problem with supervised learning, if the dataset had more variance it would be interesting it just seems to be overfitting.
Thank your. Great post... Go on like this :)
Thanks mate!
Is it just me, or do many of the 5 star reviews look fake?
Lucky you, I usually only find tutorials I am in dire need of 2 days after whatever deadline I have
Doesn't numpy have a function to create an array of n dimensions/size and fill it with random numbers?
Yeah I think that first section was largely unnecessary. Also if you know you're only running on a nix system, calling out to shell makes this a lot easier. !wget http://.../foo.zip !unzip foo.zip files = !ls **/*txt df = pd.concat(pd.read_csv(f, ...) for f in files) You need to monkey about a bit more to get the filename into the frame as data.

Extremely unlikely. Making it work the way that's "intuitive" to you would make it _completely_ counter-intuitive to the rest of the language.
Step one: tattoo I Love Python on your dick Step two:?? Step three: profit.
How so?
Because it would introduce delayed evaluation of expressions, which is simply not a thing in Python.
I love it man! Thanks for this work. &amp;#x200B; Do you guys know if are there any similar projects available?
/r/learnpython/wiki
Oof, that’s gotta take a lot more education than I got
Get your fundamentals down first. You don't start building a car when you don't know how engine works. YouTube and Google these days have excessive amount of tutorials.
I get that it's not a thing in Python, but in which situations would it lead to counter-intuitive behavior?
First of all, it will break _all_ existing code that relies on the current behavior (and yes, it exists). Also, it will introduce an entirely new concept that would only be usable in a single, very specific use case.
I just need to know where to write it and test it, I can’t learn it if I can’t follow along with the tutorials, where would one run such script? Sorry I’m fairly inexperienced in the scripting/coding world
You can install Python on your computer, along with a text editor or an IDE. You can also use an online service like [Repl.it](https://repl.it/). Any good book or tutorial will guide you through setting up an environment before they show you any code.
Ok thanks for that
Ok seriously. If you want to learn python then start with automate the boring stuff. It's basically a free online course.
Thanks for the support!
I don't doubt it'll break existing code, but that's been done before for lesser and much more basic things, like going from `print "Hello world"` to `print("Hello world")` with Python 3. Even more recently, in Python 3.6 and 3.7, dictionaries changed from being non-ordered to being ordered. If something need to be changed, it needs to be changed regardless of breaking existing code.
1. Python 3 was branched for a lot of reasons, and changing `print` to a function is not a primary one, or even a secondary one. 2. Dictionaries being ordered does not break any code, because their order was previously specified to be undefined, and making them ordered only makes the behavior more specific. 3. It's not enough to justify an ecosystem split.
You are a saint!!
Let’s go with something simple: a=2 def f(arg=a): return a Simple straight forward function that would then fail in any code base that either uses the variable a or imports any dependency that uses the variable a. Delayed evaluated default arguments would be injecting tons of hard to debug mines that would be absolutely horrible to debug. At least when you have issues with mutable defaults it’s your code failing and your issue with not understanding how functions definitions work. Imagine having to figure out if any of you dependencies ever used a variable you also use every time something odd happens. Imaging having to not use common short variable names to avoid ruining default arguments in every function you ever import... it would be absolutely horrible. Mutable defaults is a 20min subject during a intro to oython course. It’s not as bad as people make it out to be. Delayed evaluation of defaults would damage the language overall.
Dope af
I would say Ubuntu as Os and PyCharm as IDE.
I can, I just don't want to, look on StackOverflow or Google for help
Delayed evaluation doesn't require that it's evaluated in the caller's scope. The fix could just be syntax sugar for the `if defaulted_param is None: defaulted_param = actual_default` form that's recommended today.
This link helped me a lot: lmgtfy.com/?iie=1&amp;t=w&amp;q=sound+recognition+python
Maybe I’ve become overly cynical but this looks like a scripted marketing attempt.
The whole post feels a bit fake.
I'm making another attempt at improving Python's dependency and packaging workflow. Heavily inspired by Rust's Cargo. More similar to `Poetry` than `Pipenv`, but has the following differences in philosophy: - Don't modify files outside the project directory; implement [PEP 582](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/), and store the virtual env in a folder inside it. - Don't rely on Python for the tool itself (It's written in Rust). Getting binary/scripts to work in Python can be confusing, depending on OS setup and existing Python installs. - Let's you select which Python version to set up the package with, if multiple are found.
I'd be more interested in the python they used to script the marketing.

Can you put that code also to github instead of google drive ?
I don't think you can put parentheses around individual parameters, and regardless, you can't use variable names that start with numbers. You don't even use them. Instead you use a variable called `Taxable_Income`, which should be in the parameter list. So your first line becomes: `def Tax_Table(Taxable_Income):` Some more suggestions: * I think there is a bug. Try `Tax_Table(0)` or `Tax_Table(-100)`. Is that the expected outcome? * Instead of assigning to `Tax_Table` in all these different places and `return Tax_Table`, why not return the tax values directly? * In Python, the standard way of writing functions and variables is all lowercase with underscores, so you would write: `def tax_table(taxable_income):`. We use names `LikeThis` for classes and names `LIKE_THIS` for module-level constants. * You have more parentheses than you need. Multiplication comes before addition, so `a + (b * c)` is the same as `a + b * c`. * Instead of writing `taxable_income &gt; lower_bound and taxable_income &lt; upper_bound`, you can write `lower_bound &lt; taxable_income &lt; upper_bound`, which is more easily understood when you're reading your code later on.
Don't thank me. Thank my dick.
For a start, you could drop the question about user name. Then you could make a dictionary, mapping operation to function and just call `operations[what_user_typed](arguments,...)`. After that, you could google "reverse polish notation" and use that format. Finally, you could use a stack and make your calculator do longer calculations in RPN. Have fun! :)
No
Just tell your IDE to auto-format your code and stop worrying about stuff like this. Reading and writign code is much more important for a beginner.
Actually, that's precisely an example where nothing would change. Here's what you get if you run that code in Python 3 right now: &gt;&gt;&gt; a = 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; def foo(arg=a): &gt;&gt;&gt; print(a) &gt;&gt;&gt; foo() 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; a = 3 &gt;&gt;&gt; foo() 3 It's the `a` pointer that's being stored when the function is run, not `a`'s value, which is why `foo` returns the current value of `a` in every run. Changing default arguments to delayed evaluation won't modify this behavior at all. This is why the current implementation is such an issue. Default arguments still behave like being defined on execution in some situations, even though they're not. It's clearly enough to confuse even an experienced Python programmer.
I did this mostly to check out pylint, which I didn't knew existed until then. You mention that an IDE could automatically format this kind of issue, could it be done under SublimeText for example (total beginner here, I'll check on Google but your input on this would be appreciated!)?
It's very possible for the technology, but implemenation depends on your ability. I think simple data entry would be reasonable for a beginner.
I made an echo dot play zork.
Editors like sublime will use plugins for this. There are also programs that can format code such as black and autopep8.
Thanks for taking the time to format your program nicely! There's a classic method in Python to avoid lots of if statements - use a dictionary that maps the name of the operation to the implementation and other information. Sketch: import operator ACTIONS = { 'ADD': operator.add, 'MULT': operator.mult, # etc } # ... get choice! action = ACTIONS.get(choice.upper()) if action: # Get inputs... print('Result =', action(num1, num2)) else: print('Invalid input') Now, I know you have two more pieces of information per operator: 1. The description of the operation (`'Addition'`) 2. The prompts to get numbers (`'divided', 'divides'`) There are two ways to do this. An OK way is to have two more dictionaries, `DESCRIPTION` and `PROMPT`. A better way is to have multiple entries per key in the dictionary: ACTIONS = { 'ADD': (operator.add, 'Addition', 'divided', 'divides'), # etc Also, it's convenient to use `operator` because the functions you want happen to exist: https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.abs but the same technique works perfectly well for anything - you'll just have to write a little function for each operation. Let me know if you have any questions!!
You could try adding \n behind the periods in each section and deleting the print(""). It's a small change but it should work.
So what do you expect to happen when the user wrote `a = []`? a = [] def f(arg=a): a.append(5) return a
Unfortunately you're probably going to have to "drive your own car". But look at going to Code Node (Skills Matter near Liverpool St), try to find like minded people and surround yourself with them to keep motivated.
we can clearly see the redirected link in this url, just parse the url and get the query parameter using urlparse from urllib
wow this is a stupid post
Surely you mean `return arg`?
What I would expect to happen is for `a` to be modified every time the function is run, which is what currently happens anyway. Delayed evaluation wouldn't modify existing behavior here. &gt;&gt;&gt; a = [] &gt;&gt;&gt; def foo(arg=a): &gt;&gt;&gt; a.append(5) &gt;&gt;&gt; print(a) &gt;&gt;&gt; foo() [5] &gt;&gt;&gt; foo() [5, 5] &gt;&gt;&gt; a = [] &gt;&gt;&gt; foo() [5] &gt;&gt;&gt; a = 3 &gt;&gt;&gt; foo() Traceback (most recent call last): ... AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'append'
I think you intended to write `print(arg)`, right? That changes the behavior of the function.
It's a good program! &amp;#x200B; You could try to program one where a user can input a real calculation, such as "4+3" and get the result of that. In a first step, use the string.split() method to break up "4+3" into the list \["4", "+", "3"\]. Then for each element of that list, find out if it is a number or an operator. Then do the appropriate calculation and return the result. &amp;#x200B; Try do do it for "3+4", then "3/4", "3\*4", and "3-4". Then you might try "3+4-2" or similar. If you want to really test yourself, go for stuff like "4+(3/2") or even "(3+3)/((3-2)\*3)". &amp;#x200B; Have fun!
I was using /u/RockingDyno's example, but yes, using `print(arg)` would change the behavior of the function.
It's a South Park one, and a tired one at that. Worse, it doesn't even apply to this question at all.
Your first problem is a classic antipattern that probably has a name but I don't know what it is so I'll call it **Something That Should Be A Datastructure But Is Just A Bunch Of Similarly Variables Instead**. TinEpoch = {'N1': np.zeros(C), 'N2': np.zeros(C), 'S1': np.zeros(C), 'S2': np.zeros(C)} Rx1 = {'N1': np.zeros(C), 'N2': np.zeros(C), 'S1': np.zeros(C), 'S2': np.zeros(C)} Rx6 = {'N1': np.zeros(C), 'N2': np.zeros(C), 'S1': np.zeros(C), 'S2': np.zeros(C)} Next step is to notice where you duplicate code, and [extract it to a function](https://refactoring.guru/extract-method): def initialize_data_structures(which, row, index) TinEpoch[which][index] = (row[0] * 1000 + row[1] / 1000) / 1000 Rx1[which][index] = row[2] Rx6[which][index] = row[3] By the way, are you sure that code is correct? That first line is equivalent to `row[0] + row[1] / 1_000_000`. Is that what you were going for? And then all we need to do is write four for loops... or do we? The ranges could be a data structure of themselves: ranges = {'N1': range(C), 'S1': range(C, 2 * C), 'N2': range(2 * C, 3 * C), 'S2': range(3 * C, 4 * C)} for which, data_range in ranges.items(): for i in data_range: initialize_data_structures(which, B[i], i % C) The modulo operator: useful again and again and again! Next up: Rx1 and Rx6 could be initialised in a way that requires both less code and is faster to run to boot! How is that possible, you ask? With slicing! Rx1[which] = B[data_range, 2] Rx6[which] = B[data_range, 3] In fact... we can do math on NumPy arrays, so we could initialise TinEpoch the same way: TinEpoch[which] = B[data_range, 0] + B[data_range, 1] / 1_000_000 The whole module is now this: import numpy as np B = np.genfromtxt(filename, dtype = (int, int, float, float), delimiter = '', usecols = (0, 1, 2, 3)) C = int(len(B)/4) ranges = {'N1': range(C), 'S1': range(C, 2 * C), 'N2': range(2 * C, 3 * C), 'S2': range(3 * C, 4 * C)} TinEpoch = {} Rx1 = {} Rx6 = {} for which, data_range in ranges.items(): TinEpoch[which] = B[data_range, 0] + B[data_range, 1] / 1_000_000 Rx1[which] = B[data_range, 2] Rx6[which] = B[data_range, 3] Note that we don't even have the function or the modulo operator any more, but they were useful stepping stones in getting to where we are now.
As linters go, I find Flake8 gives me fewer unnecessary headaches than Pylint. More generally, most Python linters probably won't teach you much about writing code. They're mostly focused on making sure everyone in the team writes code in the same way, which is less important if you're not in a team.
I agree with others that a cleaner way to do a CLI like this is with a dictionary of function calls. It will make your `while` loop much cleaner. You can also store the string "What would you like to do? Enter ..." as a variable since you reuse. Although you also don't have to reuse that line if you put it at the top of your `while` loop instead of the bottom. Also whenever you have strings you reuse it's generally helpful to store them as variables so you only have to change them in one place. I'd suggest doing that for the operand entry strings and answer string. You can change the phrasing a bit and probably use the same string for any operand if you have it take an argument using the `format` string method. That's also how you would reuse the "The answer is ..." string.

No, it seems you're having some significant misunderstandings here. I recommend talking to your teacher and explaining to them that you don't understand the assignment. I hope your teacher can help you out.
Yeah I get that it won't work every time and that the results are better at specific poses and angles but isn't it worth it?
Good answer! There are better ways for the print statement though. In Python 3.6 or 3.7, you can use [f-strings](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/) like this: print(f'The calculation was {num1} {op} {num2} = {result}') and in earlier versions: print('The calculation was {num1} {op} {num2} = {result}'.format(**locals()))
Apart of reasons why it should\[not\] be this way, I point I want to emphasize here. It's not counter-intuitive, if you keep in mind that python is "pass by reference" language with eager execution (almost always). If func argument is a list – fine, lists are mutable, but it has nothing to do with argument design, reference stays same, and yes, object being referenced created on function import. The only way I can imagine dynamic arguments (I guess, this is what you really want, not the mutability) is to adopt some new syntax for function definition literals. Because dynamic args by default seems to be huge pain.
you can use the unittest module or include def main Simple code... import unittest def add(x,y): print(x+y) Type in program... &gt;&gt;&gt;add(2,3) &gt;&gt;&gt;5 look up def main it requires more code **I highly recomend using sololearn!** *if you still need help you can ask me.*

I read the hashbang doesn't seem to do any good in windows. Was that site mistaken? I have some code that can only run on 32 bit Windows and some other code that can only run on 64 bit (win or Linux)
Better alternatives exist: cffi for C, cppyy or pybind11 for C++ and of course cython for an incremental path of performance improvements. PyPy or Numba are viable alternatives for performant pure-python code. All but PyPy can be “pip install”ed or obtained via conda, so the batteries included advantage of ctypes is very minimal.
#! doesn't do anything in Windows, but it starts with a comment so it doesn't break anything either. On *nixes, it allows you to run the script directly. The part after the #! tells it which program (python interpreter) to run the script with. Now you don't need to type "python mycode.py" and can instead just type "mycode.py".
Ah I'm developing almost exclusively for windows, so unfortunately doesn't do me a ton of good.
There is 12 month free tier service you can test with.

Interesting. As someone with an interest in both data science and finance, this is useful to me!
Your program is basically just one long chunk of code, with the flow and calculations and interface all mashed in together. - What if you want to add an operator like POW or LOG? - What if you want to translate it to other languages? - What if you want a graphical interface, or a web interface? - How can you automatically test it? The first thing to do is separate out the "doing the calculations" part. You have a bunch of operations; each has a name, accepts two numbers, does something to them, and returns the result. class Operation: def __init__(self, name, fn): self.name = name self.fn = fn def do_op(self, a, b): """ Perform the operation and return the result """ return (self.fn)(a, b) class Operations: def __init__(self, *ops): # create a dispatch table self.ops = {} for op in ops: self.ops[self.canonicize(op.name)] = op def do_op(self, name): """ Find the named operation, run it, return the result """ name = self.canonicize(name) if name in self.ops: a = get_a_param() b = get_b_param() return self.ops[name].do_op(a, b) else: raise ValueError("{} is not a known operation".format(name)) def canonicize(self, name): return name.trim().upper() ops = Operations( Operation("add", lambda x,y: x+y), Operation("sub", lambda x,y: x-y), # etc ) You now have a self-contained set of operations, easy to call and test and add to and interface-agnostic (depending on how you implement get_a_param and get_b_param). Now the rest of your program can simplify down to def get_float(prompt): while True: try: return float(input(prompt)) except ValueError: # not a float - try again pass def get_a_param(): return get_float("What is the first number?") def get_b_param(): return get_float("What is the second number?") def main(): print("Welcome to CrappyCalc 2.0") while True: op_name = input("What would you like to do?") if ops.canonicize(op_name) == "QUIT": break else: try: result = ops.do_op(op_name) print(result) except ValueError as ve: print(ve) if __name__ == "__main__": main() which should make the logical flow of the program much more apparent.
For certain PII (emails, phone numbers, account numbers, etc.) I would recommend writing some regular expression. There are several [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44027943/python-regex-to-remove-emails-from-string) results for doing these. Names or entities (companies or institutions) are difficult to remove because the number of them can be large and it's hard to pre-define an all encompassing list. I'd recommend looking at [spaCy](http://spacy.io) and using their [NER tagger](https://spacy.io/api/entityrecognizer) as a first approach. It's well [documented](https://spacy.io/usage/training) and there are [countless](https://medium.com/@manivannan_data/how-to-train-ner-with-custom-training-data-using-spacy-188e0e508c6) [tutorials](https://towardsdatascience.com/custom-named-entity-recognition-using-spacy-7140ebbb3718) on how to re-train the model for better results too.
Okay, thanks!
Wtf? Why would you ever do the first thing? Mutable defaults is something I have never felt the need for, and that first "classic" example is pretty braindead.

Sounds like you could use a SQL database (like SQLite).
Yeah but I actually hate it when files don’t end with a newline. I spend about 60% of my development time in the terminal, and sometimes I just want to cat a file to see what’s up. Nothing aggravates me more than: $ cat requirements.txt Flask gunicorn$
Oh of course - I understand why it's part of PEP 8 (hence the /s), and always include a newline at the end of my Python files for that very reason. I was just taking the piss because they hadn't included one and they got rated poorly.
I’m actually impressed. Not by the books but by how they somehow managed to show up legit in fake spotter algorithms.
Csv isn't wrong, a database could be an alternative. You could also look into file formats like feather, parquet, orc... All of them have there own benefits

Just add `#!/usr/bin/env python3` to anything executable you release. It's not much work and the env command will automatically find the suitable python3 command in the user's PATH.
The invitation to run your code on thousands of cores is not a giveaway of thousands of cores. It's a library.
I'm sorry, what are you trying to _do_ exactly? Do you want to learn programming? If so, Python is a good language for that. Do you want to build a specific thing? If so, it depends on what that thing is. Or do you just want to end up in /r/iamverysmart? Cause that's what it looks like to me right now.

I use pycharm community and in my opinion it automates the boring stuff for python dev. Venv setup, git setup, and pep8 are all things that I know how to do, but the automation saves so much in mental overhead.
Getting the information shouldn't be hard - making sure it's the information you _want_ will be much harder. The criteria for what's "full" and "legal" are already _very_ fluid, and teaching a computer to recognize those things will be hard no matter what language you try to do it on.
Pycharm has an auto-formatter for code. I used to use that until I switched to the Black plugin for Pycharm.
Here you go: `(?:Authorization: Basic)\s*(\S*)$` Make sure to nest it in r'your\_regex\_here' if you are using the default regex library.

What are you meaning to get your first ten on pylint ?
Complete understanding one topic until you feel comfortable using it. If that's not the case with HTML/CSS and Javascript, continue with these before learning something different. That's my two cents.
This comment section has definitely convinced me to pay more attention to reviews in the future
It depends on what you want to do with it. As poster above says, getting information will not be hard. It will be a quick thing to do a crappy job of it, and a multimillion dollar endeavor to do a good one of it. &amp;#x200B; How do you deal with misspellings? A few to a dozen+ artists with the same name? etc. etc. &amp;#x200B; It is not a trivial problem, and you will need more than a language to do it.. many other concepts and disciplines. That said, Python can do it, it's just that mastering a language is the beginning of a problem like this.
I just turned your script into a feature for a Telegram bot xD Among other group related things it does, when you send it /randpic, it returns the picture that was meant to be opened in browser. Its alias, if anyone wants to take a look at it, is @TavernKeeperBot Thanks for this masterpiece of code, man xD
Thousands of cores that add up to the performance of only a handful of workstations in tandem... or, for that matter, a single multi-GPU box in fp32.
Also look into Black (the code formatter). It’s pretty controversial, depending on who you talk to because it’s uncompromising, i.e. you can only customize it for line length and whether or not to normalize strong quotes... everything else is auto formatted. When first playing with it, I *did not* like some of the format changes it made, but I really liked others. I dropped it for a while, wanting more control over how my code looks, however, after trying it again on some projects, it actually does make the code quite readable for things like, functions with a lot of parameters (that include typing), and other long lines of code. “Where can I split this line to a new line so it’s most readable??” Run black and don’t spend time on this. &gt; pip install black &gt; black -S -l 80 --include *.py$ .\modules Replace .\modules above with any file or path. The above is also from memory, so it might now be 100% correct, but it’s very close. After running black on some code, view the diff (in gitKraken, or similar) to see the changes it made. Some of it’s probably going to look weird, depending on the code complexity, but I’ve grown to like it a lot. It took a while to grow on me.
How much sense does it really make? I love Python, but it's far from being fast during execution. Rewritting the lambda code in a different language (Java/C#/other with JIT or compiled to native) should be a much cheaper solution in the long run.
I used CSV for way longer than I should have as well. Using a database is likely the best way forward. It has a slight learning curve, but if you use an ORM like SQLAlchemy, it’s really not bad at all. But if you are looking for something quick to jump into, using pickle or shelve can work just fine depending on your use case. JSON and XML are other flat file alternatives that I find easier to work with than CSV - but that may just be personal preference. Be sure to google a pro/con list for any of those just so you are aware of any limitations. But I can save you some time and tell you that many of the search results will recommend using a database in most cases anyway. Good luck!
Is this an IDE that gives you a score for your code?
I'd like to jump in on the CR fun too! :-D &amp;#x200B; [https://github.com/stdedos/](https://github.com/stdedos/)
This looks very limited and the API is unintuitive. What's the benefit of this over already well-established libraries that do these things (and more)?
For starters, defaulting an argument to anything besides a literal or constant value seems really weird to me. Having a functions signiture essentially reevaluated every time it's called seems even weirder and like it would add unnecessary overhead. Also seems like it creates more room for unexpected behavior, not less.
Make sure you can get access to development tools at your job. Their security policies may lock out your ability to automate your job on your work machine, and you won't necessarily be able to put data on your home machine due to data security policy.
Very true. Must be careful.
Thanks. Will look into it.
My boss makes us run pylint and pydocstyle and Code Style on all of our code and, while it’s a good baseline for the types of conventions you should be adhering to, it’s ridiculous sometimes how finicky and precise it forces you to be.
Will do!
No, but thanks for the input, oh and BTW it sounds like you need a hug!
Good point.
I’m not too worried about *how* I get the info, as long as it’s relevant to my needs since it’ll be a human to verify if the links provided are correct. My first thought about trying to program this kind of automation is to find out if it’s thru python or another language as python was the first one to come to mind before anything else. As it seems to be the go to when it comes to needs that need to be met.
I've heard a lot about selenium. Also beauitfulsoup. Pandas, from vague things I've read will help with the data components. Never heard of pyrobogui. Will look at all of them though. Thanks.
Then Python is definitely a good option for this.
True. I will know more when I arrive on Monday and will report back, but yeah I wouldn't be afraid to request something along the lines of "hey, I actually can make things more accurate/thorough and faster if you allow me to download this one thing called python." From their perspective if they want fast and thorough, they have no reason to say no. But again, we will see on Monday.
I need to know enough to at least get what I want out of it, no matter how difficult the task. As long as the basics are somewhat grasped, I’ll find a way.
Just get [black](https://github.com/python/black) and call it a day. VSCode can use it, do I just auto format before every commit. A lot of the decisions arent my personal preference, but it ends the internal debate and inconsistencies for teams.
I was pretty much asking because I have the natural talent for doing things in mIRC, does that automatically mean I'll have the same results with other languages? Can you think or know of another language that is similar in format or basic complexity? Doss the core of all program functions boil down to IF, ELSE, &amp; WHILE commands? This is a serious inquiry and tend to turn this into something profitable.
Who is this "program creator" you speak of? What is the "language the program creator created" exactly? "I can understand the functions of such coding" So you understand what code does but can't code? Also can I see what this "coding" you understand is?
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRC_scripting_language#/media/File%3AMIRC_scripts_editor.png
Is it actually part of PEP8? I don't see it in there, but I might be missing it. I know flake8 will warn on it though.
While this is more sophisticated than OP's code, it is actually _longer_ than his code, when he asked for shorter. :-) Also, IMVHO the `Operations` class would be much better replaced by a dictionary and a single function. I don't see the compelling need for any class at all at this level, to be honest. It adds more bulk for no documentary value Also, most of the functions you write are only used once, and don't have great documentary value, so they again just bulk out the code. Here's something that does what yours does with more error reporting in two-thirds the lines (also [here](https://github.com/rec/test/blob/master/python/calc.py)). I think it's very clear. import operator OPS = { 'add': (operator.add, '+'), 'sub': (operator.sub, '-'), 'mul': (operator.mul, '*'), 'div': (operator.truediv, '/'), 'quit': (None, 'quit'), } def main(): print('Welcome to attocalc') while _one_calculation(): pass def _one_calculation(): op, symbol = _get_op() if symbol == 'quit': return False num1 = _get_float('What is the first number? ') num2 = _get_float('What is the second? ') result = op(num1, num2) print(f'{num1} {symbol} {num2} = {result}') return True def _get_float(prompt): while True: try: return float(input(prompt)) except ValueError: print('not a float - try again') def _get_op(): while True: op_name = input('What would you like to do? ').strip() try: return OPS[op_name.lower()] except KeyError: print('Invalid command', op_name, 'Valid commands are:', *OPS) if __name__ == '__main__': main()
I know exactly what I want to do. I don’t need to master anything more than outside of that scope. As I replied previously, everything done will be verified by a human (me). So I’m not worried about artists that may have the same name since I personally know they don’t. Haven’t come across one yet, btw.
JSON and XML files can be WAY bigger than a CSV with the data. When dealing with many lines with many fields, the JSON/XML overhead can quickly overgrow the actual data stored in the file. CSV has DictReader and DictWriter which reads/writes the data as dictionaries, so you can easily access the data as `line[fieldName]`.
Unintuitive in which way? It covers the most common models: you can train classifiers, regressors, gans with and without condition and with or without encoder (bigan like). It handles for you the training loop in the distributed scenario (tf2 requires some change between the single device and multi device) and automatically performs model selection for every metric. Moreover, the concept of executor allows to change the training loop logic without changing the training loop itself. Respect to the Keras training loop (compile + fit) you have more fine grained control on the training. I'm sorry but right now I'm from mobile, so I can't give a complete (or a better) answer. Btw i just suggest you to try the library to run some ML experiment and see if it satisfies your needs (maybe at the beginning is a little bit difficult to start because if the various concepts proper of the library itself)
Cool. Thanks. Do you have any recommendations (books, youtube, site) of where I could start?
No, Pylint is a linter for python. You can pip install it. Then, you can run your script with in the command line using pylint before the python file and it'll score your code. Just how OP did it in the screenshot.
What do you want to code?
Pylint catches way more stuff though, outside of PEP8. If you're just worried about conforming to PEP8 then flake8 is fine, but Pylint cat pick up code smells, missing imports, duplicated code, typos in identifiers, etc. It's definitely saved us headaches by caching some of that stuff at build time. It's also pretty customizable in that you can change a lot of the parameters for warnings without disabling them completely. And of course, we should always be comfortable disabling checks for lines here and there where it makes sense to do so. Can't be too religious about it.
I’m just learning HTML this weekend so that NEXT week I can write a little selenium script to automate some stuff I do for work. I just watched [this video](https://youtu.be/2cyib2MgvdM) ; could anyone speak to whether large Python distributions such as Anaconda (which I use) are prone to these same issues? Should I be worried about putting malware on my work computers if I want to install anaconda there?
Python would be great for this. &amp;#x200B; However...HTML/CSS/JS are also great for this and it is what I would probably use.
/r/learnpython/wiki
You used pandas, why not just store the data in pandas for the script? Get data in tabular format in-memory -&gt; write to CSV -&gt; do other stuff -&gt; read from CSV Why not skip the "write to CSV" and "read from CSV" steps?
This is very far from right. You should listen in class and study.

That's just it I don't know where to begin.
That's just it I don't know where to begin
^ that
there is no comparison between the change in format of "print", which was quite a small change handled very gracefully, and what it would mean for function defaults to implicitly refer to what is essentially a lambda that invokes every time the function is called. it would be insane. The behavior of defaults is consistent with everything else in Python, that all objects, functions, classes, etc. are all [first class](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/first-class-functions-python/), nothing is magically a "string to be eval'ed later" as this would more or less imply. I think if someone thinks Python's behavior is unintuitive, that's only because they spent more time with other languages first. To me it is completely intuitive and immensely useful that I can set the defaults of a function at function declaration time.

&gt; I am hoping that this is the right place to ask. Yeah, there are a lot of different python ones, but I think this is the right sub. idk, I'd actually feel weird learning to python around other people. There are lots of tutorial videos on YouTube on basic stuff like slithering, swallowing (I'm fairly new too and still can't get my jaw to unhinge right, lol). I'm sure there are other like-minded people in London, just saying online is an option. *OK, I'm done now.*
Intrigued? The code is on GitHub!
Why does everyone’s line length vary so much? 😂 Don’t get me wrong, it’s perfectly fine; I have no qualms with everyone’s needs regarding line length, it just surprises me.
I mean, there are no limits except those you impose on your self. If you believe the world doesnt work that way thats fine. But I have been successful in this particular venture in the past. Took 1 dev that worked with me for free and turned it into a company where i raised 60,000$, then 100,000$ and now were pitching VC's to raise 400,000$.... So i can say with much confidence.... Rarely the world does work this way :)

Honestly: I pretty much exclusively use linux (and code on it) and never use shebangs. I think they're unnecessary
Because there are different philosophies and intentions behind why people use a certain line length :D
Screw pylint! It's too opinionated for me. I use flake8 and mypy, and I disagree with too much of what pylint comes out with!
I too am a beginner.
Okay, then why do you want to code?

Pymongo and mongodb. Free tier at mongodb.com or easy to set up yourself
Hey coding buddy, I’ll be your friend
First: I disagree with you - in the world of python (in other languages I like autoformatters but the ones for python all suck ass imo). Second: I find it funny how black advertises itself with the "no compromise" thing when PEP8 states "[A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id15)". Third: I'm on linux pretty much exclusively and never use shebangs so I'd say he's fine
Where else makes more sense to store that info?
I'm sure there's a pylint extension for sublime text but I can't comment on how easy it is to configure things/how well extensions work. I've found that VS Code has a TON of docs on how to configure things and there's a bunch of extensions that the community publishes that are super helpful for every day development tasks. Not saying "switch to what I use" but just wanted to throw out there that I've had a great user experience with vscode!!
1. /r/learnpython 2. HackerRank is giving you all of the numbers in a single line, and you're attempting to read them line by line.

Puking does much more than formatting suggestions. My worst complaint about it is how slow it is
For Sublime check Corey Schafers setup guide: https://www.google.com/url?q=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DxFciV6Ew5r4&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjYyZnF_sPjAhUFKewKHSQyA8EQtwIwAHoECAoQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0G4zkdbkMsQFcAP7VeNJcW
how can i get all the numbers in single line
You're already getting them in a single line, you just need to parse that line correctly.
Read a line, then use `split()` metod on a string (check documentation) to get a list of smaller strings to convert. This works well for small number of values. For hundreds and more, I would read one value at a time from stdin and would not collect them to sort.
Flake8 does that too. It's a wrapper around two other libraries, pyflakes and pycodestyle (formerly pep8). Pyflakes is a linter which catches stuff other than PEP8 style.
Thanks, much appreciated.
Regarding your first example: The default argument to get_time isn't a function, it is a function's return. It is usually bad practice or at least a code smell for functions that can take an argument of wildly different types. What you seem to be expecting is (apologies for formatting (mobile)): def get_time(time=datetime.datetime.now): try: return time() except SomeError: return time
Learn python, yes. It's great, fast to develop in and has absolutely tonnes of libraries that do useful things. There are no perfect programming languages though. Python is great for a great many things, but there are other languages that do other things better.
&gt;Hashbang doesn't do anything in Windows, but it starts with a comment so it doesn't break anything either. Actually, certain forms of the shebang are recognized by the py.exe launcher included with the CPython Windows installer, allowing you to force a specific version of Python when running a .py file with py.exe (either explicitly or implicitly with Windows file type associations). This is particularly useful if you have a piece of code that for whatever reason is still Python 2 only, as you can use the shebang to force py.exe to launch it with Python 2.7 even when one or more versions of Python 3 are also installed.
To clarify, looking at the code, it is clear what the purpose and functionality is. But it seems as if it's just reinventing the wheel in comparison to other high-level tensorflow APIs. It's decent code, but it's difficult to see a significant contribution over other packages
Not "avoiding", it's not having to deal with the intricacies of pip / virtualenv for a lesson or two. I said "for getting started", not "for the entirety of your learning experience".
&gt; Flake8 does that too. Does what too? There are lots of things that flake8 doesn't catch that Pylint does. E.g., from x import y print(y.not_a_real_name) We run both on all our projects because I've found that they have non-overlapping things that they cover.
I don't know. I started using pylint for my code and it's significantly more readable than my pre-pylint days even with an IDE.

I first read this and thought "Huh, I've never heard of a 'London' environment... and why would classes be any different?" /facepalm A word of advice (now that I have the right meaning): Whether you're taking classes, reading books, or whatever, try to find a project to work on instead of just using book/class examples. Doesn't have to be anything big, but it should be something you're motivated to do, so personal projects work best in my experience. I've always found that I'm more willing to really figure things out when there's some outcome I really want, vs. just "the book says this will work this way."
Any of these integrate well with Jupyter Notebooks?
I'm improving upon my LaTeX notes manager. So far the progress is good, refactored some code and added features I want to implement this week. The painful part is I have to figure out how to make a daemon that'll work across both Windows and Linux (since I'm usually working on both). Any suggestions on this? Perhaps TCP will be better? IDK, this is my first time doing this type of stuff.
You can also subscribe to the repository for future work if you are interested in using python to solve business problems. [https://github.com/firmai/python-business-analytics](https://github.com/firmai/python-business-analytics)
Depends how fast you learn and how you spend your 30 hours per week. If you manage your time well and is able to stay focused then it won't take more than a few months before you could do what is done in most entry level jobs. Getting interviews without any qualification is another question though.
pylint has some good stuff in, also some crazy stuff. It's best to disable everything and then enable rules that prevent the problems you have
It's only weird if you consider POSIX-based systems to be the "non-standard" ones. In fact, shebang lines were basically the universal standard until DOS came along and popularized "file extensions" as their alternative. Both camps are firmly entrenched now and not likely to change, but historically DOS/Windows is the weird one because they rejected the standards of the time and came up with their own weird and unique way of doing it.
Yes, it's rather weird. Rude even, to hard-code stuff that is specific for one type of OS. Not to mention that it fails immediately when using the script in virtualenvs.
This is a good answer. Yet, I'm still thinking that the file extension based association with the default tool to open said files makes more sense than writing it inside the source without knowing whether or not the binary is even located at `/usr/bin/` or somewhere different, not even considering the name.
Yes obviously they typo'd
I mean, it's sort of part of the philosophy, really. Windows for instance has the "default" program to open files associated with the file-types and stores these in the registry. -ix systems *could* so something similar, but don't have to. Afteral it is just the default binary to use anyway, you can still explicitly call a binary and use the source file as an argument, in *nix and Windows. (Please also check the sibling comments, there was a very good comment as well.)
Wrap lines! Line length is a presentation thing. Your editor should figure out how to best present the code for your monitor and resolution. These assumptions should not be hardcoded into code. Length limits for comments are silly. For code they can limit complexity.
Uh, closures for example
I want to become knowledgeable enough that given practice I could create programs for Windows and applications for Android that would eventually lead to employment. I enjoy what I do now just toying around making simple games, DOS protection for servers, changing display features... So doing something I love doing and making money sounds too good to be true.
This is my first major project (that I've fully finished) using Python. All of my code can be found [here](https://github.com/ECreates/py-mandelbrot). I know the code is pretty messy and I plan on going back and refactoring/commenting all my work later this week (if you have any suggestions or pointers that would be great). I'm calculating the points using a function that is decorated with the numba Just in Time Compiler which cuts calculation time in half (depending on the total number of points). I am still looking for other ways to improve calculation speed such as taking care of them in a c++ program that then spits the results to the same results file, although there are probably better ways to do this.
Just use pycharm like damn
No, flake8 doesn't do that, but it catches unused imports and so on. If your editor doesn't do module introspection etc, get a better editor; you're only wasting your own time.
If you want to be able to work professionally I suggest going go college. There are plenty of beginner resources out there if you just wanna start learning however. I personally began with Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner 3e which is a book by Mike Dawson. I really like sentdex so you could also do this [sentdex python playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDeAams7fkdcwOGBpGdHpXln

I’m curious if you used opencv ffmpeg ?
the goold mandelbrot!
Fireworks will never die! Also, it is the only graphics software I know very well.
What if I don't have a file extension though? I have a file in my home directory simply called `👋` (was playing with emoji file names mostly because I'm a bad person). There's no file extension on it so including the shebang is the only way to run it without the user knowing what to run it in. As for knowing what a run time is known by and where it's located, that's why we use well known paths and names. It's no different than knowing that postgres wants to bind to port 5432 by default. If someone changes that, it's on them to handle when something doesn't work. That said, `#!/usr/bin/env python` can be used to find the user's preferred python interpreter rather than trying to rely on the one in `/usr/bin`
I mean, sure, editors can often tell you that, but I was just using it as an example. There are lots of other things that an editor might not do, like find duplicate code, or point out things that might be worth refactoring. I'd also point out that relying on your editor to catch incorrect imports can be dangerous. E.g., a dependency makes an update that removes something from a module, and at build time your project pulls in the updated dependency. Without checking in CI the code would go out and break at runtime.
The main 2 reasons is to have the year as a column and merging all the txt files into a single file. The latter incase you want to import it into a SQL database or use it with other tools.
My website does use FFmpeg. However, if the desired format is MP3, AAC, Opus or Vorbis, FFmpeg is not used to do the encoding. I use the encoders mentioned on the ["About" page](https://freeaudioconverter.net/about).
As the bot has pointed out, this kind of question is better suited for /r/learnpython; although you need to have the question fleshed out, and broken down into the specific parts you're having trouble with. To help you get there, [here's an old project](https://www.svds.com/listening-caltrain/) that outlines another groups approach to solving a similar problem. Break your problem down into little steps like they did here, and verify that each step is working before you move on. It'll help you get the project as a whole to work and help keep you from being overwhelmed from all of the components.
It is insanely slow. Over five minutes on our medium-sized codebase. I really wish it could be sped up.
Technically a file that is not empty but who's last character isn't a new line character can't be considered a text file under strict adherence to POSIX (http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/ you'll have to go to definitions and then hunt for how text file and line are defined, I'm on mobile otherwise there might be a nicer way to link it).
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
When i use this line i get an error saying EOFError: EOF when reading a line
I like Go's community opinion on this: basically, the consensus is for everyone to just use gofmt and stop worrying about formatting. I wish more languages were like this. Honestly, as we all do, I may have my preferences over brackets, line length, whatever, but in the end what actually matters is formatting being consistent, and having a standard solution is a really convenient way solve the debate before it even begins.
Well, I've done that with VBA and SQL. Is just that I'm missing the basics with python and I'm not sure how to speed up the learning process. That's why I thought that maybe I should take some classes/courses
Don't use in hackerrank.
Okay..is there any other way to run this program in hackerank.
No unit tests. I would never trust untested code.
What the task?
Also a print statement in a library? https://github.com/lagmoellertim/pyon/blob/master/pyon/pyon.py#L23
It’s a new project of mine and I’m still working on it. It was published 2 hours ago.
One way I've handled the merging is to create an empty dataframe then loop over each csv and read into a dataframe and then append those to the empty dataframe. For the year you could add a column to the dataframe during the loop by reading in the year using a substring of the filename (same way you created the year var).
Probably to early to publish or to even call it a project. Do the work first.
Given the participants' score sheet for your University Sports Day, you are required to find the runner-up score. You are given scores. Store them in a list and find the score of the runner-up. Input Format The first line contains n. The second line contains an array A[] of n integers each separated by a space. Constraints 2&lt;=n&lt;=10 -100&lt;=A[i]&lt;=100 Output Format Print the runner-up score. Sample Input 0 5 2 3 6 6 5 Sample Output 0 5 Explanation 0 Given list is [2,3,6,6,5] . The maximum score is 6, second maximum is 5. Hence, we print 5 as the runner-up score.
&gt; was playing with emoji file names 😠
Nice work. How about pushing the code to GitHub so that others can benefit from it as well :)
 Well, they got to 2nd level guru (i.e. jaded to death, checking out the grass colour on the other side) fast.
&gt; without knowing whether or not the binary is even located at `/usr/bin/` or somewhere different This is why shebangs usually use `/usr/bin/env python` as their binary rather than directly using `/usr/bin/python`.
 I know what you mean (been there), but is this a reference to xkcd or something?
All your print outs for your if statements are "Num1 + Num2"
Awesome work. Thank you for sharing, AP.
What do you mean? Why does that mess it up?
They're all adding instead of doing their intended operation
My solution: https://pastebin.com/JCmeZNgy You read from one string numbers. Your code works if input was: 5 2 3 6 6 5 But input in hackerrank: 5 2 3 6 6 5
I partially stopped carring about tab and space formatting. Thats way to specific lol.
Feel free to steal my code I use for my reddit bot: https://github.com/Almenon/reddit_episode_bot/blob/master/omdb_requester.py
You could create an html template and then render it to png with \[python-webkit2png\]([https://github.com/AdamN/python-webkit2png](https://github.com/AdamN/python-webkit2png)).
 print("Calculator - ") num1 = int(input("Enter a number: ")) op = input("Enter arithmetic: +, -, *, /\n") num2 = int(input("Enter another number: ")) if op == "+": print(num1 + num2) elif op == "-": print(num1 - num2) elif op == "*": print(num1 * num2) else: print(num1 / num2) Here's an example
Thanks
Whoops, forgot I did that just to see if it would do anything different. I changed them to int, made them all do their intended operation. I didn't realize how important indenting was so that made the if and elif (changed it) work. Thank you.
Some people just like pain, I guess.
Yeah why isn't it 💯 like good meant it to be?
My experience is that the things that pylint catches above and beyond flake8 are 95% false positives. e.g. * "Too few public methods" is almost always wrong in my code base (very often in cases involving inheritance classes with one method are just fine, and it's easy to have many instances of these in a code base) * It complains about missing doc strings, but these are also often unhelpful. A method with a good name might not need a docstring, and if you force people to add docs like this you get bad docs: &amp;#8203; class Frobnicator: def enable(self): """Enables the frobnicator""" Comments like this are much worse than nothing, and [reduce the value of all comments in the codebase](https://jameshfisher.com/2014/05/11/your-syntax-highlighter-is-wrong/). If you add a linter like pylint to your code base, I'd expect the average quality of comments to go down, with lots of overall negative value comments being added just to keep the linter happy. * 'X' has no 'Y' member - often get false positives if you use any dynamic tricks. (If you don't use any dynamic tricks at all, are you really getting value out of Python? And lots of frameworks do.) * "Too many lines in a module" - any limit you set for this is arbitrary, and will inevitably end up with modules being split just to keep a linter happy (or more effort just shutting the linter up), instead of according to actual needs of your application. Similarly almost all the "Too many" warnings. * "Unused argument X" - in code which uses a framework pattern of any kind, which enforces a signature on certain types of functions, you will get false positives here. * Naming conventions - these are mostly helpful, but there always times when you want unusually named constants and functions, plus pylint can't tell the difference e.g. you might write \`run\_foo = Foo().run\` as a convenience module export, where \`run\_foo\` is now a callable that should be used like a function, but pylint thinks it's a constant so it should be \`RUN\_FOO\`. So you still waste lots of time dealing with pylint errors one way or the other. When it comes to actual definite bugs like typos that will result in \`NameError\`, flake8 has your back in 99% of cases. So I've never persevered trying to integrate pylint. That's my 2 cents anyway.
very nice bro!
Now if I wanted to make a calculator that could do stuff like: 5+5/3\*6-2 or something like that. Being able to do all that in one line and it gives the answer, what would I have to learn about next? I get if statements and how variables work so far.
May you use Markdown for description.txt?
Thank you!
Really neat! Thanks for sharing this approach.
&gt; nts to delayed evaluation won't modify this behavior at all. The value you get from a's pointer changes when you get a's value. It would effectively change to the same as a function that was doing a = 2 def foo(): arg = a return a
I'm actually new to Python myself. I might be able to piece together some sort of method, but it'd probably be an ugly way to do it and would be incoherent, if I managed it. You'd have better luck finding an example, looking for solutions of stackoverflow, or finding a module that was made for this stuff.
Gotcha, wish me luck! I want to get into coding so I'm just at the basics pretty much. We both got a long journey.
&gt; code smells Where is the list? https://docs.pylint.org/en/1.6.0/search.html?q=smells&amp;check_keywords=yes&amp;area=default is slashdotted for me.
Your code example is wrong and your confusing yourself. What you ment to do was print arg not a, of cause a changes value when you change it. The point is that arg=a is carried out on definition (which sets the value not to a pointer, you're thinking that because you messed up the code). This is what actually happens when you correct the code: &gt;&gt;&gt; a = 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; def foo(arg=a): &gt;&gt;&gt; print(arg) &gt;&gt;&gt; foo() 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; a = 3 &gt;&gt;&gt; foo() 2
1. Check that python is installed by just typing “python” into terminal and see if the python shell opens. 2. check that your program is written correctly (although this is unlikely the issue if absolutely nothing is happening.) 3. check this post: [Why won’t Python work in PowerShell for me?](https://www.quora.com/Why-wont-Python-work-in-PowerShell-for-me) 4. try running python directly from command line instead.
Thank you! I'll check them out! I'm still sort of new to python so I am slowly figuring out how to do stuff like this.
Good luck, all about practice.

Oh, I didn't mean to imply that you shouldn't find any classes; definitely do that. Taking a structured class can be a boon when you're first starting out, especially in exposing the core syntax and structure of the language. My comment was just borne of personal experience, where I've taken a class and then sat there going "now what?" If I don't have something to work on then anything I learned starts to atrophy.
well, based on his profile picture, he has switched to Rust
Sublime is great if you use do a lot of different stuff (python, shell script, xml files, ruby, etc.) But I find PyCharm Community to be way more helpful if I am writing something larger than 20 lines of code give or take. Things I like about PyCharm that Sublime lacks. &amp;#x200B; * PyCharm will grey out variables, functions, classes, etc. that are being used any way in your code * PyCharm will warn you about PEP8 standards (like should have a blank line at the end) I use sublime as a general text editor, but if I specifically going to code something in python that isn't like a quick few lines of code then I am going to use PyCharm.
I have always been a fan of the precision issue related to this set. The set has infinite complexity which means it has more complexity logically than our current models and interpretations of the universe suggest. However, if you play with the set very much, you will hit the limits of precision. In fact, I believe of all the "play" programmers can experience, this set shows how quickly we can hit the limits of precision. I have not skimmed the code yet but I assume this problem has not yet been solved within your code and I myself in such play never solved it either. If you watch fractal zooms on youtube, it's clear these computations have solved the issue. I am not sure if I have seen a real-time peice of software that uses variable precision for mandelbrot zooms. I was thinking of playing with this area again in Godot programming but may be getting a bit more hyped into VR development (e.g. WebVR). If you are interested in chatting it out some, I could try to chime in on this fun challenge with zooms and really unlocking that "infinite complexity".
That's a great recommandation, I'll check PyCharm ASAP.
Your suggestion doesn't change anything. These two functions behave identically: def foo(l=[]): l.append(1) return l default = [] def bar(l=None): if l is None: l=default l.append(1) return l So even if you make the "syntactic sugar" of making the first version be identical to the second, you aren't changing any behavior. Well that's not true, it would introduce a lot of edge cases that suddenly need to be handled, but the point is that it wouldn't "fix" anything. Using the recommended "if None" check doesn't change what's going on. It's just that most will either recognize why what they where doing was wrong in the second case, or they'll do two changes, one of making the if-check, and the second more important one is to initiate their mutable variable at call-time. def bar(l=None): if l is None: l=[] l.append(1) return l Natural problem is of-cause that if you try to make that standard behavior suddenly it's impossible to pass mutable arguments into functions, which means anything remotely OO in python will break, and you'll not even be able to define classes at all because you can't pass around self (which is naturally mutable).
Really depends on what you are trying to accomplish. I use lambda regularly to do ETL tasks and it saves me days of waiting for jobs that I might only run once or twice, where it takes me only minutes to write the code in python but might take weeks or months to write in another language.

That's my case also. Is just that I'm confused about courses. There are too many and definitely some will provide genuine knowledge and some won't. That's why I've asked about them. I was trying to find out if there are some worthy courses around here. Anyway, thank you for giving me some advice
I've definitely noticed the precision issues as I've zoomed closer and closer, and looking at the result file while running the program just further shows this. Even after a handful of zooms it looks a bit off compared to some of the much more advanced zooms I've seen on YouTube. I'd love to talk about it or take any suggestions!
Your IDE didn't auto-lint? Which one was it?
Sorry, not null but NaN is given there.
All hail the JVM - I think I have Stockholm syndrome...
No idea what this is but I can imagine that it was quite tricky. Well done!
Sure, you could write a script using the os package and shutil.move to recursively move your package. Could do something like this (mobile formatting, sorry): for dir in os.listdir(DOWNLOADS): if dir.endswith(.package): shutil.move(dir, DESTINATION)
&gt; you're thinking that because you messed up the code Are you serious? *You* messed up the code and then edited it several hours later without even mentioning the edit. At least be honest about it.
Thank you! The mandelbrot set is basically a set of complex numbers that, when iterated over, never increase beyond a certain point (in this case if the real part of the number is greater than 2 or less than -2). If a point on the complex plane is in this set it gets colored black. If it is not in the set it is color coded based on home many iterations it took to grow above 2 or below -2. If you want to read a bit more about it [this](https://plus.maths.org/content/what-mandelbrot-set) article is very helpful.
I notice that you put the calculation code in pure python, which can be quite slow. I suspect that you can use numpy to make this run in almost realtime. Regardless, Well done!
What are you talking about, you're printing **a** not **arg**. Of cause **a** changes its value when you change it. The point of default arguments beeing assigned on function definition is that **arg** is set to the value **a** has at definition time. So when you print out **arg** (not **a**) you see that the value doesn't change even if you change the value of **a**. And not that even if you define a new variable in the global space that has the name **arg** it still won't affect the functions because of scoping. &gt; This is why the current implementation is such an issue. Default arguments still behave like being defined on execution in some situations, They don't. You think that because you switched up **a** and **arg** in your pring statement.
How do I format it? I did import os, shutil so I have those now and I replaced downloads with the directory to it and same with destination but I get an error still
Should work.
import os import shutil &amp;#x200B; for dir in os.listdir(\\Users\\(Name)\\Downloads): if dir.endswith(.package): shutil.move(dir, \\Users\\(Name)\\Documents\\Electronic Arts\\The Sims 4\\Mods)
Idk how to format on mobile, but the snippet should be three lines, delineated by the colons.
&gt; I have a file in my home directory simply called 👋 (was playing with emoji file names mostly because I'm a bad person). There's no file extension on it so including the shebang is the only way to run it without the user knowing what to run it in. This is an awful argument in favor of the shebang line. If a user doesn't know what to use to run a file, there's a very good chance they shouldn't be running it regardless. The emoji filename just makes it worse, since it means the only way to have the slightest idea what the file does is to open it up and read it. Which means they would figure out what program they need in order to run it.

Like that bove but an indent for the bottom one?
So the big question from here is how much do you want to do. A good starting place is the wiki: [Arbitrary-precision arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic) The simplest example of doing this is to create a long number by building into an array of smaller numbers and then handling appropriately the edge cases where arithmetic floats from one array indice to the next. I believe I have played with this but this gets rather computationally expensive and specifically in the mandelbrot set you only care about part of the numbers changing (the more you zoom in the more the first part of the number is the same for all the numbers you are looking at). So from deciding if you want to do it yourself or if you want to try to use a library, we can decide which methods to explore or again just leverage someone else's work (who probably has really solved the issue very well): [C++ multi prec arithematic libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_C%2B%2B_multiple_precision_arithmetic_libraries) Finally, if you note the aspect I described about mandelbrot zooms (that the numbers are related), then we actually arrive at [Perturbation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_theory). This is beyond my studies thus far but I could still dig into perhaps some of the literature. I think this is where you really learn the "crazy tricks" behind the mandelbrot set and generating it from a perspective of understanding the mathematical phenomenon within the set. This would be my ultimately goal in studying the set. My lasting desire with interaction with fractals has always been to better understanding emergent phenomenon and find interestig computational ways to generate such profound aspects of nature (or as Mandelbrot pointed, "The Fracal geometry of Nature" (and since nature created life, thus follows fractals are highly related to understanding life [e.g. consider multi-fractal analysis of genomic data]). Let me know if you are more interested in trying to generate your own means of infinite precision or leverage a library and maybe I can be more help.

Four spaces for each indent. The shutil.move line should be indented twice and the if statement line should be indented once

How to answer a simple question How to ignore it
Oh for sure, to each their own. If it doesn't work for you, it doesn't work for you. I think personally the false positive rate is way less than 95%. I think my takes are * Too few public methods – Something I rarely run into, but I also don't use a lot of classes with inheritance. Generally I see that when I'm creating something that's just storing data, in which case I can convert it to a `namedtuple` or a DataClass. * Docstrings – I actually really like that it forces docstrings. Sure, if you're not diligent, you'll just end up with useless ones. But if you put a little effort into it it's a great way to make a documented codebase. Module docstrings are in particular something that I wouldn't write that I think are a good place to give some context and documentation. * Dynamic tricks – I personally don't use them that much. Here and there for sure, but not nearly enough that it's worth disabling the check for the rest of my code. And of course you have to disable that check for things like pandas and SQLAlchemy. * Too many lines in a module – This one (and all the "Too many" ones actually) seems super reasonable to me. You either refactor if it makes sense, or just add the `# pylint: disable` comment at the top if it doesn't. I've gone both ways several times—it just depends on context. I don't really view it as something I *have* to do, more like a sanity check. If I've written a function that takes 10 parameters, does it instead make sense to group those into a class or tuple? Possibly, and if so, then I will. * Unused argument – I rarely get this from framework code. I think the only time I've see it is from adding Celery event handlers. * Naming – of course you should disable the check for names that don't need to conform. We do that for top-level exports, etc. But again, I'd rather do that from time to time and keep the checks for all the other places. I don't know. It seems like you're reluctant to add the `# pylint: disable` statements when they make sense and instead are treating it like you have to do every time. I guess if it's really the case that 95% of the errors you get would result in a `disable` then I can see where you're coming from. But again, for me it's almost the reverse. Maybe 5% of the time I'll disable something after getting a warning.
Thank you! I was going to use numpy at first, but while I was reading up on the best methods to calculate things quickly found that numpy was actually slower for this type of code than just using JIT (there were other alternatives that were faster such as PyCuda but I am currently away from home using a laptop without a dedicated gpu). I definitely want to work on speeding it up and I plan on doing some reading into the best methods for this. The specific article I mentioned is [here](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/jfp/entry/How_To_Compute_Mandelbrodt_Set_Quickly?lang=en) (I tried to use as few resources about the actual code behind it as possible, so this is the only one I used directly pertaining to calculating the set).
&gt; "no unnecessary else" what about else in general which is what I asked in my comment?
I would love to do as much as I can from scratch, mainly just for the challenge and to further my programming and math skills. I will have to read the full resources you sent me later today or tomorrow when I am less busy but Perturbation theory sounds incredibly interesting. Thank you for the feedback and I'll make sure to reply or dm you once I've read a bit more and have a better idea of what I want to do.
Ew.
I wish I was overreacting, but working on Java has actually made me enjoy programming less.
Good. You added some unit tests. That's a start. &amp;#x200B; Now I have a question for you. Can you tell me what you think about the following lines? import json class SomeObject: def __init__(self, a, b): self.a = a self.b = b obj = SomeObject(10, -1) json.dumps(obj.__dict__) '{"a": 10, "b": -1}'

Java? Java ?!! The only language I'd want to use less is Objective-C. &amp;#x200B; At least use C# - 100x better than Java and a proper modern language with a best in class IDE and runtime.
 thanks gamer
I made the opposite lol
You've never used Perl then I take it. God they were teaching that when I was in college. I still get the shakes whenever I encounter an old CGI endpoint on some ancient eldrich website. The circles of hell, in order of greatest torment are: Perl &gt; Obj-C &gt; Java I agree entirely that anyone that just can't click with Python should instead consider C#.
There are some nice things to appreciate about Java. Interfaces are pretty sweet. There's just absolutely no reason to ever use Java again now that we have Kotlin.
Why? Why did you remind me of Perl ??
And the question never asked, What makes you consider only those two?
Pssst, we got Kotlin which is interoperable with Java!
It might be! Good is good!
That's the magic of Java. ☕
👋 is purely for my own enjoyment when I open vim in my home directory by accident. The broader point I'm making is that I shouldn't have to care that docker-compose is written in Python and to run it I have to do `python -m docker_compose` I just run `docker-compose`. If it gets rewritten in go, then I don't change anything in how in invoke it.
Me too, thanks.
The JVM is great, it's Java that sucks
These days the CGI scripts are in bash If you think I'm kidding, the fossil website uses it as a script for hosting repositories :|

My teacher in the python course stated, that it can be learned in two days, if you already know common programming paradigms. She was right, even though some things needed more time for me to get used to.
Performance (at least better than python and ruby), solid design patterns that are really well represented in Java, memory safety, cross-platform... It's not a bad language, but I'd argue that you get all that with C# these days and it's much easier to read and write. It's an artifact of the time it was introduced, great for its time, but it didn't age well. At the time the memory-safety was huge but that's not as rare these days with many other popular languages, and for a lot of problems (if not 90%) the performance of python is not close to a problem. When your bottlenecks are more commonly terrible performance DB logic in your code, network activity and disk read/write, no one should care about the extra 10 microseconds it takes for python to run some function.
Sounds good. I am happy to bounce ideas off of and it would be good for me to engage my thoughts in this area again. Cheers.
speaking of "switching", I really miss the simplicity of Java's `switch` statement. Sure, we can use some "dictionary magic" or an `if-else-if` ladder, but it just doesn't feel the same.
Ohhhh yeah, I didn't mention PHP on that list... but then again I also didn't include Fortran and all the other obsolete languages!
You said " Do you follow all rules put forth by pylint? " The rule in pylint is that there should be no unnecessary else, which is what I do.
This[ blog post](https://charlesleifer.com/blog/misadventures-in-python-packaging-optional-c-extensions/) discusses putting the `setup.py` call to `setup` in a `try` block. That might work for your case.
loop through the digits and check if you are on a odd or even position to determine if to multiply for (i = 0; i &lt; length; i ++){ if (i % 2) { total += input[i] * 2} total += input[i] } something like that
The way it's written feels like it should be Python as well (case [pattern] followed by a colon)
I wish I had more constructive feedback, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading through your analysis! As someone newer to python, this is what I'd like to be capable of.
Welp. Time to get my hitman.
Good luck! This is the first step of many.
All the way around for me, I hate Java, even tho I'm a mobile developer now
Traitor
I’m working on my first larger Python project and there is a lot I love but it has some quirks like the missing switch statement that leave me scratching my head.
Well PHP, or rather their internal fork Hack, still runs Facebook!
This is a question for r/learnpython. It’s quite simple. If the ISBN is presented as a string, iterate through the string, convert it to an integer, and use a modulus operator to determine whether or not it is even and multiply accordingly. Something along the lines of for i in range(len(ISBN)): if i % 2: # i is odd else: # i is even
I was kidding! My husband is a PHP dev, and I love to tease him about its obsolescence.
Corporate Java developers would love to switch to Kotlin too, but they're stuck maintaining Java 6 spaghetti code because management doesn't see the value in fixing techdebt.
Honestly, aside from Bash, I've never seen a good situation where a `switch` statement would be appropriate. It seemed more like an anti-pattern every time - bulky, rigid, the cause of problems.
Kotlin's `when` is really nice for this. Simplifies if/else chains quite a bit and reads cleanly. I think Ruby has something similar!
Meh. I haven't used a `switch` in many years. Superior alternatives: - **Pattern matching:** functional af - **Dictionaries:** better for large `n` anyways due to `O(1)` lookup - **Polymorphism:** rethink your design - **if-else:** Just use an `if-else` in tight loops if your language doesn't support pattern matching and the dictionary overhead is too much for some small `n`. I guess you could argue that Haskell's `case-of` is similar to a `switch`, though it's obviously more powerful since it supports general pattern matches rather than solely `Eq` based comparisons.
But there are these cases, especially in data engineering. Python is indeed really slow. It's simple and gets the job done, when the job isn't too memory intensive. But because of the GIL, and its very bulky memory footprint of all the objects, and because of the huge baseline performance hit, Python is often not suitable. As alternatives I've looked into Go, which on one thread is as fast as Python+Numba, except that Numba severely limits the features you can use (still good if you find a bottleneck and can write it Numba-compatible). But the thing is that I want multiple threads that are able to access shared memory. And here, I would normally go for C# since I know it well, and some people would go for Java or Scala or whatever. However I gave D (DLang) a try, and it surely didn't disappoint. Aside from being very unpopular (thus no big selection of feature-rich libraries), it's extremely fun to program in, and gives C-like performance.
I think you need to escape the back slashes with a second backslash. Give it a try and see if that works.
Use Java if you want to make money, but lose your soul
holy shit is this sub serious? everyone acting like fucking children over what programming languages people use? &amp;#x200B; python and java are like any other widely used modern programming language - they have their pros and their cons, situations where they are well suited and situations where they aren't, and everything else &amp;#x200B; you can't just rank programming languages from best to worst, they're too complicated for that &amp;#x200B; so stop acting like its some cardinal sin of programming to use java in 2019 and grow up a little bit
Hi Reaper, I saw your question this morning and decided to challenge myself. I uploaded my solution to [here](https://gist.github.com/j-chad/099821409bf074b857a471a44f665618). In short, I built a abstract syntax tree (AST) using the shunting yard algorithm.
&gt;* **Dictionaries:** better for large `n` anyways due to `O(1)` lookup In C a switch is also constant time using a jump table (assuming reasonable switch values).
Not necessarily so &amp;#x200B; [https://github.com/shosca/django-sorcery](https://github.com/shosca/django-sorcery) [https://github.com/shosca/django-rest-witchcraft](https://github.com/shosca/django-rest-witchcraft)
it's ".package" with the quotation marks, also you need quotation marks around your paths. finally you need to escape your escape characters so its C:\\\\Users\\\\ not C:\\Users\\
Eh, don't take answers to a joke too serious - or the joke itself. Sure, I join you in your thinking, but I had to giggle about the post for second, myself.
Bumping this for updates, I'm looking for anyone doing it in Resolve/Fusion though
I know. But you tool claims to remove "dead code", but only removes commented out code. Those are different things. I'm just saying the wording you are using for a tool that removes comments seems misleading and a maybe confusing.
Python for GIS So much cleaner than using a model builder
It’s not hard guy
Makes sense depending on the kind of applications that he or she is creating, and also what kind of user "experience" they want when developing. For example, although I find Python to be more "fun" than Java to write in, I'd choose Java in a heartbeat for any large application that I had to maintain (solo or on a team): Static types, interfaces, explicit POJOs over lists and tuples, error-checking code is actually encouraged over *overuse* of exceptions, etc. Also there are more jobs that use Java (generally speaking). Don't get me wrong though, I've created large applications in Python before, just prefer Java for that use-case.
I loved programming again when I switched to Python. Java takes something beautiful like object oriented and makes it a lumbering behemoth. It’s like taking a lotus elise and turning into an RV. They can put a ferrari engine in it and make you build a special track just for the RV, but it’s still awful to drive and sucks all the joy out of the whole experience.
Could you give a toy example of Pattern matching?

Yes, why not? It happened everyday. People switching language. Programming language is one of the easiest thing to change in CS field. It just need to fit your needs. Of course I am using Python, but at the same time sometimes I need to PHP. And I am about to use Java/Scala since the work requires.
Check out `pathlib` ```python from pathlib import Path import shutil source = Path("/path/to/sim4/") dest = Path("/path/to/share/") for package in source.glob("*.package"): shutil.copy(package, dest) ```
There's a couple of typical usage patterns. The simplest is what people *mean* when they say they want "switch" statements. Notice that there's no fall-through. match expr: case "one": return 1 case "two": return 2 default: raise ValueError The next is more fancy: match expr: case (): return Empty() case (x,): return Single(x) case (x, y): return Pair(x, y) case (x, y, z): return Triplet(x, y, z) case (x, *xs): return Many(first=x, rest=xs) Others really only make sense in Haskell/Rust where the type system supports it and the usage is actually practical, rather than this contrived example... match expr: case Empty(): return [] case Single(x): return [x] case Pair(x, y): return [x, y] case Triple(x, y, z): return [x, y, z] case Many(*xs): return xs A common usage pattern in Haskell is: unbox (Box x) = x unbox Empty = undefined ...which works because tagged unions are part of the type system.
Thank you for the indepth response, practiced a bit more today and started to get really confused with the mathematic side of things (guess i need more practice), anywho i will be sure to decide what project i would like to undertake. thank you again
why not do it yourself? the cpython api makes it very easy to implement any change you see fit.
How effective is the paid tier in managing billions of rows of data?
I ran your script. On my machine it completes in 30 seconds (unaltered). Part of what you're experiencing is a difference in the operating environment of your script. If your friend is using Matlab, that's running on a beefier machine that you or I have. ;) The other part is some optimizations you might be able to make if you look into your libraries' methods. What I was was a small amount of time was taken for array initialization and population, and a large part was taken up by plotting. If you can find a more optimal plot call, that will be a good refinement. I'm not sure it exists. Good luck!
Since I'm gearing up to go back to school for CS I thought it would be a good idea to learn some basics of Java before starting. The first tutorial I found spent most of the first lecture explaining the 18 million features of IntelliJ, but not how to set up IntelliJ to actually run the fucking script, so I ended up spending half an hour trying to figure out what the fuck a workspace was and how to make one. Then when I realized that I was basically looking for a tutorial for my tutorial so I stopped and went with a different tutorial entirely. This guy was using NetBeans, and he spent most of his first video explaining why NetBeans was the superior IDE, and I decided I didn't feel like reliving what I just went through. Attempt 3 was finding someone who just collected the syntax definitions in an order that made sense, and I spent 2 hours trying to figure out how to "and just compile and run the script", because he could not be fucking bothered to say "javac [main] ; java [main]" Point is, I don't know if it's the language itself since I barely learned it, but my hatred of Java is so intense I am honestly rethinking if I even want to go to college.
I think Perl is fine if you don't plan on reusing the script. I think it's good for those times when I need a script to do just one thing, and I'm basically just going to delete it.
I usually get lost when looking at init and self. I can do functions fine and I'm guessing methods. I just have a hard time trying to use them and actually figuring out how to use them for any reason. I think I'm just going to eat them until i get it because it's held me back for so long. I can code fine until i need to use them. Thanks for everyone's thoughts.
There’s nothing wrong with enjoying one language over another
Been learning Kotlin recently. It's actually really nice. Can definitely see why it's loved so much.
Coming from C, I think dictionaries are much cooler than switch. O(1) lookup, baby! Can't beat that. And scalable, too.
The JVM was a good solution when it was created, but with computers becoming faster, interpreted languages becoming more usable for complex tasks, and compiled languages being easier to Port across systems, I think the JVM has lost a fair amount of its appeal.
That's why Groovy is such a godsend. A lot of the same syntax as python, code you can run as a script instead of compiling it, and loads of other loveliness.
int(input("Ask these kind of questions at /r/learnpython next time. "))
It’s possible, but could be kind of a difficult task as you’ll need to determine what the inter/intra-dependencies are for each module. Another way would be to create your own modules for everything, and cannabalize the code from the existing modules. This might be an easier approach as you are just copying functionality rather than the files themselves.

In PyCharm you can vertically split the same file to get 3 columns right now. (Window-&gt;Editor Tabs-&gt;Split Vertically). It doesn't have the automatic flow from one column to another, but you can have the 3 (or more) columns at different locations in the file.
One word: Anaconda [http://www.anaconda.com](http://www.anaconda.com) I teach Python short courses most weeks, and it has saved many headaches. Likewise PyCharm (although Jupyter is great for diving right in).

How do you differentiate between what's interesting or not? I mean, do you see a blog post that's interesting for you and then put it into the DB or is there some NLP here?
https://docs.python.org/3/library/modulefinder.html
Sure, there are certainly tons of use cases where the performance of Python *is* a problem, it's just that I've often heard people complain about Python performance when they haven't touched a profiler or looked into potentially slow logic hitting a database. I've seen someone complain about their simple script using [DictWriter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictWriter) taking 90 seconds for something simple that processes a ton of dictionaries and writes a CSV, then I profiled it finding that the `extrasaction` was taking like 95% of the time, added `extrasaction='ignore'`, and it sped up to running in ~5 seconds. Now there's something to be said about a standard library function's default args having poor performance, but still just a couple minutes in a profiler might solve a problem much better than rewriting it in java. I've seen someone complain about a flask app's performance, profiled it, and it was taking 4.5 seconds to respond because a necessary API call it makes to another service took 4 seconds. They thought it should be rewritten in Java, but they'd be using the same API it does, so good luck with that... I've seen someone say that the Django app just "does a lot of work" and it was taking an hour and a half to process some daily chunk of data. I looked into it, found that the DB logic could be improved a ton to cut down on queries and make bulk inserts, and it literally sped up 100x. Most of the time I've ever heard someone say that Python is the source of a performance issue, it hasn't been. It's either poor logic that can be dramatically improved, networking, disk read/write, database logic, or a combination. Sure, Python IS slow in comparison to many programming languages, but often I find it's way faster than anyone needs for their problem. Most people have much simpler problems than they think and good python code will be plenty fast. But yeah, you're going to have some problems where python is obviously not good enough - if you have a billion matrices to process or something like that and profiling it shows that no function is taking way longer than it should, I'm going to guess that Python isn't the best answer. But even then, I'd look into using the CPython API with C/C++/Rust and try to write the heavy computation parts into a compiled library that Python imports from, or just write the whole thing in C, C++ or Rust. If you're willing to write C++ libraries for Python, you can pretty tackle 99% of problems with Python and C++, except lower level system stuff like writing drivers. Even the GIL is almost never an issue because it still doesn't block on OS calls like socket reads, and concurrency is usually fine due to that even if only one bytecode can run at a time. And beyond that, there's multiprocessing. And beyond that if you truly need multithreading and no process overhead, there's writing C++ libraries that CPython imports. The only question is whether it's worth it to wrap it in python or if the whole thing should just be done in the lower level language - but regardless, Python is almost never a problem with performance if you're willing to profile, optimize code, use multiprocessing/concurrency, and beyond that write lower level python libraries in another language. I won't argue that Python is a performant language because it's definitely not in comparison to Java/C#/Rust/C/C++, but I way more often hear that Python performance is a problem when it's not the underlying issue.
People definitely like to overcomplicate the workflow for Java. It's the one popular language I can think of where almost everyone uses an IDE specifically designed for it. For a while I used EMACS and javac, and that was fully sufficient, so use whatever you're comfortable with. As for Java itself, like most languages, it has its strengths and weaknesses. Java definitely isn't a good language to start with (for that, I highly recommend Python), but the complexity does give it some benefits, like very high levels of correctness compared to languages like Python or JavaScript. I personally don't like Java, and if I was choosing a language to use for a new project I definitely wouldn't pick it, but it's a good language to know because of all the legacy code, and if you keep at it you'll get used to it eventually.
Great tutorial and well documented. Working through your code I learned about the request and zipfile library. Thank you!
Python 3 `input` is **exactly** Python 2 `raw_input` with the name changed. Take your Python 2 code and do a search and replace of `raw_input` to `input`, and it should Just Work. &gt; The program asks for an integer value value = input("Give me an integer! ") try: value = int(value) except ValueError: # Put your error handling here.
You can look into how Nmap does it - the idea is to send very specific sequences of packets that different operating systems respond differently to, and then watch the response for specific behaviors.
Thanks, will try.
For reference, here's [nmap's fingerprint database](https://nmap.org/nmap-os-fingerprints).
I use the thumbnail method to do the trick. with Image.open(file) as im: size = 1028, 1028 im.thumbnail(size)
My foray into Graphene was similar, ugh. I've used [Ariadne](https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne) for less than a week but I'm liking it so far. It is less rigid than Graphene (resolvers are just functions). There are valid criticisms of SDL-first frameworks that I haven't yet run into myself. I also know of [Strawberry](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry) and [Tartiflette](https://github.com/tartiflette/tartiflette) but haven't used either yet.
Thanks buddy, you saved my life. But I’m trying to avoid nmap in this project. Is there any other source besides nmap?
I'm not aware of any other large databases of fingerprints like this one. You could try to collect your own, I guess.
I make Starlette optional for installation, you can use `pip install 'pygraphy\[web\]'` for installing Starlette with Pygraphy or just install Pygraphy by using `pip install pygraphy`. Thank you!
Interesting, could help me here, thanks :)
He meant how long to program I think
Yall made me read an hour worth of stuff I dont understand, I cant even program. But I'm heavily interested.
At the moment it is strictly manual, curated from my feeds, but I do have NLP on the long time horizon for this...
Thanks for the reply! I've solved my problem.
No problem dude! I'll be sure to check it out It makes me happy that so many people are getting enjoyment out of it c:
Most Awesome!

great

Impressive, and good timing; I'm messing around with Python generated fractals as well
Chill, I just asked
Thanks for the very comprehensive examples. You're absolutely right and have given me suggestions on how to improve performance in some places where performance isn't really an issue for me, but would definitely be nice. I chose Python in places where other developers would only know Python. It's simple and readable. Writing 40 lines of logic that solves the problem definitely wins over starting up a Maven project, even if it might be sightly slower. It's cheaper to pay for more server power. But to add to what you said, I do know many places where performance could be fixed, like where someone is reading all the rows from a database (millions) before starting to process them, or when a large API response is saved into a file and then that file is fed as a stream, etc. I knew about those fixes for a year and did nothing, because there's more important things to do with my time, and Python really takes away very little of my time compared to other platforms and languages.
lol this was funny

Why Ubantu and not Linux though?
Reading books! I'm working on Automate the Boring Stuff.
Cool!
Strange. I fixed this and it's still showing it for some people
I can’t believe that s$&amp;t! Six months! Python is a an incredibly complicated language. (Good luck arrogant son of b$&amp;&amp;!) Some people.
Some suggestions on speeding it up: calculate and render at the same time. You're writing to a list then iterating that list to write to a file, then reading that file to render it. Jit is cool, but it's even cooler if it's were `nopython=True`. But thanks for the sources, they're really nice :)
Try to update! Should be fixed in the 0.1.5 version I just uploaded
You can build a twitter bot, its fun and you can work with real data. And if you are into NLP (spaCy) you can analyse tweets text and create cool visualization (Panda). * I put libraries which you could use in parentheses
Thanks! Sounds like a cool way to make some money. I'm kidding this is definitely portfolio material.
That was exactly what I have been looking for. Thanks a lot.
I'm kinda learning Scrapy through the docs. Is there something you'd like to recommend?
So after a long time of trying to figure out what I should do with myself post-military (4/6 years down) , I decided that programming was something I do enjoy. Thus about a week ago I have been checking out which languages seem good to learn for future job prospects and decided that based on a lot of information that I found that it would be a good baseline to start with. So, about 24 hours ago I started watching beginners guides and reading books, documents, and looking up commands for python and can say that I feel like I am catching on quick. My first program that I did after some research was a simple program that, say, a snackbar would use to calculate gross and net profit of the items sold that day. You would input the amount of x item sold and then in the end it would multiply the x amount by the price for all items and I had my gross profit. Then I had the gross profit \* taxes and subtracted the wages paid for the net profit. Second one I made was, well lets say weird. I wanted to test how far I could push myself after only about 5 hours of self-teaching and how well I could keep track of all my variables and inputs, so I made a program that first off gave you your age based on your birth year, birth month (as an int) and then birth date. Then I kinda thought about click-baity stuff like "CLICK THIS IF YOU WANNA SEE HOW LONG YOU WILL LIVE" type thing I have seen on the internet before. So what I did was turned on "import random" and had a RNG set to add years (1,100), months (1,12) and days to the persons current age and output that as the age you will "die at". Then I had it display how much time you have left to live in YMD format. It was a little tricky because I know my coding ability isnt the most efficient right now so I was at like 50+ lines of code and when I hit an error, it took me ages to regress and make sure the variables would correctly display since the error was showing 32+ days instead of converting those days to a month and using the remaining days instead. Sorry for the rant, I am just pleased with my progress in a day and am enjoying this quite alot.
May be try the [decimal](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html) module. it handles arbitrary precision decimals, but i suspect its also arbirtrary slow. If you want to do your own thing using only numpy arrays, definitely check out [numba](https://numba.pydata.org/)!
It's still an absolutely fantastic JIT VM though
You can find very good python free courses online on youtube. I dont think you get more from applying to this course than online free courses. Here you can see lots of youtube channles that are related to python: https://realpython.com/python-youtube-channels/
A little bit of advice. Read a lot, there are lots of good material online, Check realpython.com. and Dont get discouraged. If you blocked by something just ask. There are lots of good communities like this subreddit which are willing to help. And good luck :)
Ubuntu is a distribution of Linux. I would choose it because it's the most popular Linux distribution among developers and it's also a very popular os for servers. It's well supported and easy to install.
If data is temporary use tempfile module
Is there a way to do it in integers? The old fractint program used to do it that way for speed reasons (running on an 8086 you need all the help you can get!) but with Python of course ints have no limits. Could that be exploited somehow?
That's cool! Could you share the code?
Any special reason for using pygame? I'm looking to start a first mock project myself but I've mainly been learning data science packages.
Everything in Python is "live code," meaning that every line is actually run. Your def is an actual statement that is run and stored in memory as a function object, along with all the default parameters. When the function is called, Python uses the stored function and those parameters. Changing a default parameter later would mean that the def line would need to be run again, which is not possible.
Play around with some python machine learning. Bit of a pain to start off with, but once you get the set up right, downloading tensorflow for your IDE. Creating an image recognition software is quite simple. Google already have half the code done for you! Look it up on youtube theres tones of videos, not to mention, machine learning on a portfolio will allow you to stand out from the basic scripts and programs people usually create
If you want something client side that's a web app, it's going to be very hard not to use Javascript (unless you're willing to try out Brython, but good luck with that) because Python does not work well in the browser. If you're making a native application, requests will make HTTP requests for you and you can use the socket module for sockets. If you want something server side, **use Flask.**
Nice! It might be better if you loaded them from a file.
Im actually going to scrape them from a website if I have time to work with it but reading from a file could be a good fallback if there is no internet or can't scrape
If you host on Heroku you can install OpenCV and use Postgres
I think flask or a derivative as the backend and some sort of js framework with REST or websockets for the front end. The modbus client can be done entirely in flask, running as a background task/service.
I have a friend who's got heaps of ideas but unfortunately he charges $5 for each idea. I'll give you my paypal, please PM me.
Me too
Nice! It seems to lag each time you zoom in.
Wtf
Thank you. Course looks pretty generic I must agree.
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/
Its highly overpriced. If you understand English we have great Python courses on Udemy that you can get for as low as $10. We also have a lot of quality and well done python tutorials on YouTube.

Maybe implement something like PiHole.
Start at /r/learnpython. They have good resources in the sidebar there.
Please don't. Cryptocurrency is useless and mostly used for scams. Don't enable this terrible technology to spread.
It is used for scams only by some people. But the whole technology isn't wrong, because you don't depend on third party or any one, and because everything is decentralised. In decentralisation is future I think. Plus new lightning network allows small and instant payments, which can be used for anything(for example in music services, pay not for month, but for how many seconds did you listen).
Lots of fun stuff on my plate lately: * Some upstream database tables I use are changing schemas, column names and key encoding effective Aug 1 which effects nearly all of my code and I just found out about it this week so that'll be fun. * Still working on a reporting project with a focus of data that I already manage which is nice because I can just focus on the needed transformations/aggregations. Soon, however, unfamiliar data sources will come into scope which I'm not thrilled about but I'm holding my project owners accountable for data and rule definition. * Also continuing to work on accumulating historical detail which I have been previously overwriting but no longer need to do as I've acquired additional database storage. Perfect timing since the reporting project requires this detail. I'm also going to be adding additional demographics type data as well. It's kinda funny how this worked out because I've been marking this capability for a long while and, now that it's catching on, my boss now wants to build it into the tools that he is the owner of lol. * I also found a bug where a change in normal code did not make it into some specialized code to fix another data problem. That's enough for now.
Java is arguably a dying language.
Check out the wiki for this sub. Also, what are you interested in? Is there something you're curious about that you could program something to better understand? Are there subjects you're interested that an example project would keep you interested? For me, it's data and statistics. Who's buying what, who's talking about what, who's programming what, who's going to jail for what, who's making money doing what, etc.
The code still needs some work. I'll share the github repo when it's all polished up.
sounds good. thanks!
Legend has it he is still zooming
I think a chatbot would be pretty cool to program.
