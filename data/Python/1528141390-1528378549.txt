What I dont get is why you think I am not making this decision for myself. Seems like you think "disagree = sheeple"
Yep. I'm working on one right now (a blog / ecommerce site). The code is open source under the GNU Affero V3 license and is on Gitlab. But unless a lot of people start working on it with me it won't recreate that feeling of working on a team.
https://checkio.org/ They have some gamification, and you can see other people's submissions. Look at the ones marked "clear" and not the ones marked "fast".
Well then posting your repo might help.
I started off as a C programmer. Moved to do a bit of C++. Then kinda stuck on Python but I've done JavaScript and C# as well. I even remember doing a bit of Java ages ago so I'm not just stuck on Python. I want to learn Rust next (I want to be able to build all of my website front end code in Rust and compile it to WASM instead of using JavaScript). I'm technically disabled so have some requirements that commercial companies might not be too keen to give unless they are sure they are getting a "good thing" in return. Hence volunteering for a bit. I wouldn't mind doing 3 to 6 months for free. The charity idea is a good one. I'll start emailing a few of them. I'm happy to learn whatever technology stack they use (I just hope it isn't Windows Server Datacentre with an Oracle DB but that is unlikely given the cost). As I said in reply to the other person who responded to this post I am currently working on an open source blog / ecommerce platform for the same reason. To get my name out there.
If you’re new, creating a game would be much easier in a game Engine such as Gamemaker 2 or Unity. Might check those out before you dive too deep into python. 
I've only just got out of hospital so I haven't worked on it in a month. I did some work for the first time this morning but haven't pushed to it yet. Will probably do that tomorrow. I'm streaming myself programming on Twitch while I am doing it. https://gitlab.com/glamorous-systems/seductive
What libraries did you make this with?
A question. A major concern on writing technical post is that something I wrote was rubbish or wrong. So wanted to post here get feedback, consider your thoughts, correct errors, improve quality, etc. Thank you btw, I added my question.
/&gt;picking the emo thot
&gt;I want to be able to build all of my website front end code in Rust and compile it to WASM instead of using JavaScript That sounds cool, just bear in mind as a commercial skill, it's not currently a directly marketable one. It might impress people (I'd be impressed), but you're not going to find many jobs with that in the essential skills list. And in the UK it's illegal to discriminate on the grounds of disability and big companies are hugely aware of that to the point that many will guarantee interviews to anyone who is "technically disabled". So don't waste 6 months volunteering for that reason, get out there and see what happens, you have literally nothing to lose.
It would be somethingbthat shows off your skill, passion and personality. then again I might be looking for something exactly specific about hey have you ever built in enterprise class application with C in JavaScript and.net. Focusing on what the recruiters wants is a horrible strategy focus on what you do well and try to appeal to them but the ultimate decision maker is the company they get you the interview for so they're just a gatekeeper
https://www.firsttimersonly.com/ then https://up-for-grabs.net/
They're still raking in billions by extorting Android handset manufacturers with patents they "may" have, but won't publicly admit to. Just as they've extorted money from Amazon over AWS too, over patents they ostensibly have that apply to Linux.
Good luck to you too!

https://www.firsttimersonly.com/ then https://up-for-grabs.net/ For scientific projects specifically, it depends on what you'd like to work on. - My most important advice: start *really* small, like fixing a single typo. Once you've been through the whole process once, have the project installed in a dev environment etc, *then* add the extra challenge of a code change. - Xarray and Pandas are both well-run projects that would welcome small contributions. Astropy would also be great if you're in that part of the community. - Jupyter or Dask are more infrastructur-y. I don't know much about the code but you could check them out. - Numpy is too low-level to teach you much about Python development, and very conservative (properly, for a foundational project) - Avoid matplotlib like the plague; it's a complete mess and will teach you terrible habits if you so much as glance at the code. I'm serious - I love it as a user but from a dev perspective the implementation is terrible. If you want to try other-than-scientific development (and that's no bad thing), [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) has a great test suite, decent contributor documentation, and very helpful maintainers. See their [good first issues](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), eg \#162 looks easy. Or find a bug in a project you use, create a feature you want (after opening an issue to check it's in-scope), etc.

It is just that one of my requirements is working remotely for the time being. I know most of the work is in London and I can't make it to an office everyday. Even if the job was in the same town I'd probably still need to work remotely. I'm not sure many companies would be happy with that. I know that companies are required to make "reasonable adjustments" under the law but is that a reasonable adjustment? I don't know. Thank you for the reply by the way.
It worked pretty good in 2005
Way to choose the creepiest girl to implement this with...
Ah yeah, the 100% remote work thing is a definite problem. You should look at freelance work as a longer term option - you're much more likely to find that kind of work remote friendly.

Congratulations, great results. Experimenting with new/different stuff is what takes our knowledge further.
You heard it here first. Not using Microsoft^™ means I’m stuck in the...past?
I'll look into CITA and continue working on this open source blog and then I'll look into freelance stuff once I have something show for my work.
We must edit the Zen of Python to forbid this
**TL;DR:** Enums in Python don't make sense. Simply forget they are there. It's a completely useless feature. They don't serve the same purpose they would do in languages like C or ML. In fact, they don't serve any purpose. To some extent, you may find some subclasses of `Enum` to be useful, like `IntEnum` or `FlagEnum` or whatever it's called, but bare `Enum` isn't worth the effort. ---- Enumerations are only useful in conjunction with some language construct which allows programmer to split execution flow into fixed, known beforehand number of sub-flows. In other words, you need something like `switch` from C or `match` from ML for enumeration to be useful. If your language cannot recognize that your program is trying to handle an impossible case, or that it doesn't handle a possible case--you don't need enumerators, a simple numeric constant will do just fine. In fact, even better, since in Python `Enum` class is huge and heavy (entirely implemented in Python). Your program may as well spend significant portion of its time simply instantiating enumeration members instead of doing any useful work.
Perfect use for filter -- `''.join(filter(str.isdigit, old_string))`

Thanks, I'll repost there. If you click the link you'll see what I'm talking about. It is basically visualizing every letter of a text as a square that has a color, then u feed full texts and you get an image of colored boxes. 
Slavishly maintaining an outdated stereotype of a company that has undergone significant culture change, and refusing to have anything to do with them based on that outdated stereotype, is most certainly a stuck in the past mentality.
You win. Creepiest thing I've seen all day. I won't report you to the ATBGE sub reddit, But Great Execution and I mean that. I disagree, in order to keep the creepiness factor at the maximum-- do not listen to the guy suggesting to make her blink. Also, make one that is more "professional" that you should show to employers-- it is well done and you should be proud of the code you wrote when it does cool stuff.
what link? Did you read your post?
Distrusting a company that has repeatedly shown itself to be distrustful is not clinging to an outdated stereotype. It’s having a healthy and sensible view that said company is going to have to earn back lost trust. They haven’t come anywhere close to proving to me that they have changed significantly. 
1 \- Indeed they are extremely intertwined, and I will explain my reasoning here: The `Signal` class is self\-explanatory: it saves an array of complex numbers and some other arrays that are computed directly from the first one, such as the amplitude and angle of those complex numbers, as well as a series of floats such as signal width and peak power. At first I thought about making it the 'main' class and simply use Spectrum to get the related spectrum, as you sugested, but there is a problem: there are problem parameters which I might not know and which need to be approximated or calculated through other means. In a way, a signal is independent of where it propagates, but analysis is not. As such I created the Problem class. The `Problem` class serves as a kind of extension to `Signal` where I can define a series of parameters related to the medium of propagation, such as that `n` above. Now, since the spectrum is also influenced by the medium of propagation, it has to be incorporated in `Problem`. I did go around reading a bit about metaclasses to avoid this zoo, but ultimately I decided to avoid complexity and go for a lengthier code that I know I could get to work. 2 \- I assigned a single `Signal` to a` Proble`m and propagated it, saving it to an array at some definite points; that's where I got the list of signals. Therefore those signals are related to the original problem but will exhibit different characteristics, which I want to retrieve. In fact, as you say, this process is a re\-calculation and I intend it to be so. However, when I re\-calculate a single signal from a list I should be executing the very same commands I would from a signal assigned to a variable, but that is not what I see, I get up to 10x slower execution. 3 \- I did end up associating them in this past hour, you are absolutely right. I did not know about that 'partial' function, but I am looking it up. Seems to me like there is some advanced python machinery such as that that could help my code, but unfortunately I believe the investment would be too large and I don't have that much time in my hands. Thank you very much for your time. I understand it is hard to deduce what might be wrong simply reading walls of text, but I don't really know how to build an SSCE, as AzlinaZahMakha suggested.
I don't want to suggest you should be ashamed of being weird. I'm weird, you're weird, IS/IT people in general kind of get a pass on being eccentric assuming you can put a lid on it when you need to. The social equivalent of closing the door on your messy room-- it is still a mess, but no one notices. Except for HR, those gatekeeping judgemental bastards sometimes will hold it against you-- and then hire someone that is actually more wierd, but doesn't fly their freak flag so loud and proud.

Lazy minds will say 'but what about X?', while Microsoft continues to make moves like this. It's in their DNA. It's not just your opinion when you say things like the behaviour is consistent and it's in their dna. You're making some claims that beg to be backed up by more thoughts or evidence. 
And what would that take. Better question, and it is a genuine question, what could they do to change your mind. Because if the answer is "nothing", then theres no real point.
The [Uncanny Waifu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley)
**Uncanny valley** In aesthetics, the uncanny valley is a hypothesized relationship between the degree of an object's resemblance to a human being and the emotional response to such an object. The concept of the uncanny valley suggests humanoid objects which appear almost, but not exactly, like real human beings elicit uncanny, or strangely familiar, feelings of eeriness and revulsion in observers. Valley denotes a dip in the human observer's affinity for the replica, a relation that otherwise increases with the replica's human likeness. Examples can be found in robotics, 3D computer animations, and lifelike dolls among others. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
It is possible and they were doing well. I appreciate their attempts to undo their historical contempt for open source. It’s not been enough yet. And extending their monopoly and killing one of the few big independent companies in the open source community is a significant step backwards. 
I agree, this does seem possible.

I'm not fixing my fat finger mistake on the last of four weirds in the post. With any luck I'll be reported to the madlads subreddit...
Your use of the term 'killing' tells me that you really don't actually appreciate their efforts. If your instant assumption is that they are killing it, well it's fine. I think the only change will be that pricing tiers will play nice with Azure, because that would make sense for Microsoft to make back some of their cash.
It’s pretty uncontroversial that they are killing GitHub as an independent company. This is a sad day for the open source community as the technology world becomes that much more monopolistic. That may well be the only change they make. It also may not be. I don’t know. And until I get a good reason not to I’m going to mistrust their motives here.

There's no universal answer to these questions. It depends on what you're going to do with it. It also depends on what kind of cards we're talking about (poker, hearthstone…) as that will impact how complex the differences between cards are. Here's what I think is the best advice to answer this question: * Keep it simple. Don't try over complicate things before it's necessary. * Don't be afraid to refactor if you ever realize that something more complex will be necessary.
Bit of a surprise! Shocking as it may be I actually think this might help GitHub if they can afford to put more development effort into the service. Of course that can lead to an increase in expense and thus costs for users, but that was bound to happen. There are many bytes of data stored on Github and frankly that has to cost them money. So the only really bad thing I see coming from this is that GitHub will likely try to find a way to monetize the service to a greater extent than it does now.

Thank you for providing feedback! I just realized that performance usually depends on the parser implementation not the serialization format itself. It's meaningless to compare performance without benchmark on specific implementations. So I removed the performance statements. \&gt; JSON stream parsers/writers exist as well.

I am a hiring manager. I look for projects which are nontrivial for your skill level and that demonstrate you are motivated to learn about something new. Ideally it will also show skills related to the role you’re applying for. For example, an interesting project I saw recently was a simulation of galaxy formation. It was nontrivial because handling a large number of particles and calculating the gravitational force between them in a performant way is hard and it demonstrated motivation because the person had to first read about theories of galaxy formation (from Wikipedia).
They are a bit more complex than just indexing (poker-like) but not as complicated as hearthstone To give a good overview we have a pool of 10 effects (or "unique factors") and each card can have min 1, max 2 of those 10, in any order. So not much complex, but a little more than just an index So basically I go with the first I'm comfortable with, and then refactor when needed right?

Yes. To clarify, I'm not saying this is the right approach for *every* software project. Obviously a large scale project will require more planning. But this sounds more like an early stage hobby project, so based on that I wouldn't worry too much. I have a couple of hobby projects that and I often refactor just for the hell of it, mostly when I learn about a cool new technique I want to try. That's what hobby projects are for. If you don't choose the best approach right away you may have to invest a few hours into fixing it later but you'll learn something along the way. Just go ahead and have fun.

Homophobic, racist, and a dick. Wow, you really tick all the boxes. Your post history is deplorable. 
There's no One True Approach for architecture (though there are principles). It's a balancing act between your needs, complexity, time to set up and so on. I would suggest you decouple effects and cards. Have an Effect class representing the game effect logic - the 'what' of the gameplay effect - and attach it to a Card class handling the 'why' and the 'how' as an attribute, or better yet - an iterable attribute's item. Different card types may thus freely inherit the default effect from the superclass, the class, or be customized during initialization by passing a (list of) effects to the new card constructor - meaning you would not have to build new classes to implement special cards with custom effects. You could also for example define the Cards as forms of applying the effects: Let's imagine you're making some sort of CCG-esque wizard-themed card game (because it's easier to make up examples for it): you could have a Wave Card with a Fire Effect that would apply Fire damage to all enemy units, a Ball Card with a Fire Effect that applies Fire damage to a single unit, a Wave Card with a Water Effect that applies Water damage to all enemies and a Ball/Water for damage to a single enemy again - this way you can freely mix and match. So you'd have a run_effect() function on the Card, override it with a map(Effect.doathing, enemies) in the Wave subclass and a Effect.doathing(enemies[0]) in the Ball subclass, for example. I would NOT reuse instances. Doing so violates the abstraction of what an instance *is*. An instance of a Card should represent a single 'physical' card, you can always operate on type(instance) attributes and class/staticmethods if you want to do something common to all cards of the type. Let's say you got hit with a Silence Ball effect, which is supposed to make you unable to use a single random card. If you reuse instances, you couldn't easily do that - the effect would propagate to all places this instance lives. No bueno. Again, this is primarily a question of what do you actually NEED out of the program in the long-term - and if there will be a long-term. The whole point of a well-structured project is to reduce your frustration in the long run at the price of more thought and development time now.
Thank you, I'm proud of it
How can python do motion tracking?
No u
No you both
Java or C#
Instead of agonizing about which way to do it, you'd be better off just doing whichever feels like an okay approach first and then refactor later.
I covered this situation in the Microservices class I gave at PyCon 2017: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrzLdMWTRMM. The solution I presented at the class was based on maintaining a "wheelhouse", which is a local directory on the system where container images for the microservices are built. If you do this, then you can install those private packages by adding the `--find-links &lt;wheelhouse&gt;` option to pip. Example Dockerfile from one of the microservices: FROM python:3.6-alpine ARG SERVICE_NAME ARG SERVICE_VERSION ENV SERVICE_NAME $SERVICE_NAME ENV SERVICE_VERSION $SERVICE_VERSION RUN mkdir /app COPY . /app RUN touch /app/.env RUN pip install --find-links /app/wheels -r /app/requirements.txt RUN pip install pymysql gunicorn WORKDIR /app EXPOSE 5000 CMD ["./boot.sh"] 
Well that's...creepy. Now for super-cringe factor, when it loses contact with your eyes, make it say, "Where are you going oniichan?"
&gt;... &gt; &gt;Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! &gt; &gt;Please don't use Python to make creepy waifus
Here are two classes, unimaginatively named "A" and "B". Class `B` calls `A.method1` either through a single class variable, or a class variable that is a single-element list. class A: @classmethod def method1(cls): pass class B: single_method = A.method1 method_list = [A.method1] @classmethod def call_single_method(cls): cls.single_method() @classmethod def call_single_method_in_list(cls): for m in cls.method_list: m() Here is a crappy little timer context manager because timeit's use of code in strings annoys me: from contextlib import contextmanager import time @contextmanager def timer(label): start = time.time() try: yield finally: end = time.time() print(label, ':', end-start, 'seconds') Now we iterate 'n' times calling each of the two classmethods in `B` (as well as time the base looping and method resolution overhead): # we have to make a lot of calls for the time interval to be at all measureable num_calls = 10000000 with timer('just looping n times - subtract this from all other times'): for _ in range(num_calls): # what is the overhead of looking up the method? # just reference it but don't actually call it B.call_single_method with timer('call single method'): for _ in range(num_calls): B.call_single_method() with timer('call single method in list'): for _ in range(num_calls): B.call_single_method_in_list() Running a few times to rule out flyers gives roughly (remember, these times are for 10,000,000 iterations): Loop/name resolution overhead: 0.75 seconds Calling method attribute: 2.5 seconds Calling method as element of a list: 3.2 seconds Subtracting out the overhead that we could measure gives ~1.8 seconds for calling the attribute directly, and ~2.4 seconds calling the method from within a list, about a 30% penalty. But since these methods don't actually do anything, that percentage in your program will probably be dwarfed by the actual method behavior. The point is that calling as an attribute vs calling a list of functions doesn't show anywhere near 10X slowdown. Try timing just the calling part of the code - it may be that your list construction is doing lots of unexpected repeated work. 
I will recommend c++ instead of Java
The most common languages for gamedev are C# for Unity Engine, or C++ if you're rolling your own or using Unreal. You will also need Javascript for your website because you can't do anything on the web without JS, and possibly LUA for in-game scripting. Python generally isn't used in gamedev (there are some exceptions like Mount and Blade, EVE, and Civ 4) except for Visual Novel games where Renpy is basically the entire market.

You misunderstand my argument. I'm not saying type-inference is impossible. I'm saying Python has no ways to deal with enumerations, which is a special case in dealing with types a.k.a. sum types. To drive this point home, try to recreate the error / warning below: C: typedef enum example_t { a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 } example_t; void example_missing_value(example_t e) { switch (e) { case a: printf("a\n"); break; case b: printf("b\n"); break; } } void example_extra_value(example_t e) { switch (e) { case a: printf("a\n"); break; case b: printf("b\n"); break; case c: printf("c\n"); break; case 42: printf("unexpected enum member\n"); break; } }
&gt; were nice to work with What were you doing with them? My argument is that they are useless because they don't improve on other means of achieving the effect of splitting the code flow into multiple sub-flows. I.e. a numeric or a string or any hasheable variable will do just as good as enumerator, while requiring less effort from both the programmer and the interpreter.
How do you manage git dependencies in setuptools?
Sadly, installing Python for a new user is one of the hardest parts about learning Python. Which is a shame, because Python is awesome, relatively easy to learn, flexible and powerful, and has a great community. This link: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) should give you the right Python version for Windows right off the bat. When it downloads, make sure you click the little box at the bottom that says "Add Python 3.6 to PATH", so that you can actually run a script once you write it. The default installation comes with two important things for you: IDLE and pip. pip helps a lot with installing packages. When you want to install a completely new Python package, you'll need to do so in a command prompt. On Windows, you can do that by going to the Start menu and typing "cmd", then picking the "Command Prompt" option. From there, type \`pip install {package}\` and pip will take care of downloading it and installing if for you. Finally, when you try to download numpy/pandas/scipy/scikit\-learn/statsmodels/many others, you might find \(like I did\) that not all packages play nicely with pip and/or Windows. However, pre\-compiled binary files \(also called wheels\) for common libraries can be found here: [https://www.lfd.uci.edu/\~gohlke/pythonlibs/](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/). After downloading, you can install them by using \`pip install filename.whl\`.
maybe a flask-restful API?
I think you could always contribute to one of the major Python libraries (say, scikit-learn, scipy or any of the specialized libs, eg biopython) with some algorithm or another. Not sure about other areas, but at least in boinformatics there are quite a few methods available in R, but not in Python. Then you get to call yourself sklearn contributor, which sounds pretty cool. Check their contribution guidelines to see which ones are outsider-friendly.

Anime people are so weird
Every day we stray further from God's light.
&gt; Why is the default behavior of 'Enum1.A' not to return the value like it is for C#, Java, and C++? This just forces me to add 6 extra characters and makes accessing enum values look uglier. since when does Enum1.ITEM return a value in Java? Enums are not thin wrappers around integers. Enums are singleton objects of their type, which makes it impossible to compare against mismatched values. `Enum1.ITEM == 1` is an error because it's not C and it's comparing a ref to an int. To get the ordinal number of the entry you actually have to call the ordinal() method. And in case you assign your custom logical values to enum entries, you actually have to declare attributes for them, write a custom constructor and ways to expose these values.

Ooh yes I didn't think of the Effect class then passing it to Card instances, that instantly sounded me as what I was searching, it makes clear what-does-what and it does not useruse classes and subclasses. Thank you really much for untangling this knot!

Question: Why not do your work in Python 3 and not think about it? I mean you shouldn't be using the OS distributed python anyway since breaking it could mean breaking your OS.
This. And make sure you are very restrictive and cautious on non breaking changes on the shared portion. Eventually if the two services diverge away from the shared bit too much then each might choose to maintain a separate fork. So, for this reason the shared package should ideally be maintained in its own repo. 
Sounds like a security hole big enough to push a planet through. 
Nice project, now do something like animoji with DDLC characters. Don't worry Monica can wait you, she has whole eternity. 
Except that this will be "type checked". You're less likely to make a mistake. It's very nice to provide for users of your library.

Lots of butt hurt programmers in here. They obviously have learnt a language that is "faster" and "better docunented" or "more applicable". This is great when they learned, back then a 8gb stick of RAM was considered witchcraft. Now we have the resources to make "easier" languages like python keep up and remain effective. Spend less time on BS syntax and more time on concepts and solutions. That's where the value lies in a solid engineer/programmer. Good luck with everything you do and keep us up to date with any exciting projects.

Hey, thanks for your feedback! Yeah, I agree. You need an account to save your progress - but how should you know if nobody tells you... I will fix this in the next days. ;) Can we use your feedback on the website? Django is a great framework for rapid development. Yet, getting it running on a production server can be a pain. You can contact me if you face problems deploying it, maybe I can help. 
This little beast is built on pdb, and allows me to debug remote python code remotely via ssh. I use it very often and it's a life saver. https://github.com/inducer/pudb
I would say golang. It is relatively easy to get started and the language is fast, simple and easy to deploy. Other people will of course diasahree with me. See for yourself, the language is quite useful and the standard library gets you pretty far.
In my opinion it depends what kind of game and in which part python will be used? If we are talking about python, it is certainly possible to create some web game, where backend will be done in python, and frontend in javascript. Or you can code the whole game in c++ or c#, java, when it will be stand-alone application.

&gt; In that case, for multiple cards, should it have an instance for each card of that type in deck, or one instance used multiple times (with a list?)? ... I think you also need to keep the order of cards in the deck, so then I'd say one card is one instance. &gt; Or should all cards be instance of a class Card, passing a "callback" function for their effects? Something better? Yes, that is one possibility. You will probably need an object of type GameStatus, and the card's effects will be applied to it to make a next move.
It mostly depends on where you want to go, the quickest way to learn something is by choosing your own project. E.g. automating something that you have to do often \([Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](http://automatetheboringstuff.com/)\), writing your own website, writing your own twitter bot, playing with various APIs, scraping some website and analyze/predict patterns. The list is endless For data science and crunching data I can recommend [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and trying to analyze various data sets \(e.g. [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html)\) For web there is [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), where Flask is light weight and you can quickly prototype something. If you want to play with 3D, [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) has an Python API. However it does take some time to get into it. Since you mentioned ArcGIS, I can highly recommend also looking into [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) if you want to play with GIS software. They offer an Python API where you can automate things or write your own plugins. There are various GIS modules like Basemap, geopandas, fiona, shapely. Here is for example a tutorial on [Geographic Data with Basemap](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.13-geographic-data-with-basemap.html)

Build into containers?
The second example would typically be caught at compile time. If `Foo` enum has values A, B and C, then your code would write `Foo.A` and `Foo.42` is a syntax error. The first example would compile and run with the missing case but (a) I don't think that's a bug, and (b) you would probably write it with a function as the enum's value (they can hold tuples) and dispatch programatically, in which case you could loop over the cases and guarantee not missing any. 
thanks! I'll check it
I hope not on production server ;\) yes, there are a lot of enhancement built on top of general debugger for python
Don't objectify women like that.
If you're looking at games then C\+\+ \- it''ll cover UE4 and also allow you to use any of the nice libraries/frameworks available if you want to roll your own \(Ogre, BGFX, SDL2...\), and it's a commonly used language in general so is good to know. Unity uses C# which is a simpler language to learn but it's less used outside as the .Net push seems to have died off. For a third language I'd recommend JavaScript. A few years back I realised I was learning a lot of new languages but it was becoming a detriment as I wasn't really mastering them any more so I focused on the C\+\+, JavaScript, and Python and things seem to be working better as I'm able to keep a better eye on how things are changing with them. Between the three \(and with a little bit of domain\-specific languages\) I seem to be able to do pretty much anything in my chosen field of 3d graphics.
You might want to check out a language that has _zero-cost abstractions, guaranteed memory safety, threads without data races_ and _trait-based generics_. Also, don't forget about _pattern matching, type inference, minimal runtime_ and _efficient C bindings_.
Usually enums are more about uniqueness and comparability and less about the actual value. I think you confuse enums and the idea of constants. If you want some grouped values use some regular class level attributes without the enum decoration: class Const1: A = 1 B = 2 C = 3 print(Const1.A) 
I haven’t used a Chromebook in years, but I believe you’ll probably be able to install a Linux distro. That’ll probably be your best bet.

I can't say that it immediately made sense to me, but I can say that you are confused about something here; your second and third points are just untrue as far as I can tell. You can totally reuse a name at multiple levels of the heirarchy. You do need to explicitly import subpackages and submodules, but functions and things defined in a module don't need their own imports.

As a registered archtiect, an advanced Revit user, and somewhat novice Dynamo and Python user, let me suggest a few things. *Learn parametric design by really diving into Revit tutorials - especially family creation in both the normal family editing environment and adaptive component / massing environment. * Try to become as much of an expert in these before worrying too much about how to manipulate them using Dynamo / Python. * Learn basic Python. There are TONS of resources out there for basic Python. I used Learn Python the Hard Way (but wouldn't recommend it as a starting point, honestly), and Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart. ATBSwP is a great resource, as it teaches good basic Python, as well as some interfacing with things like HTML / Web browsers, Excel, and basic operating system interfaces. *Start building some functional programs with basic Python, such as batch file processes, or simple games or puzzle solving simulations. This will help you tremendously in conceiving a problem / potential solution, then grinding out the actual solution. Learn a little bit about Object Oriented Programming and classes, as this will help you understand what is going on with specific methods that apply in Dynamo / Designscript. *Learn Dynamo using resources such as the [Dynamo Primer] (http://primer.dynamobim.org/en/), the [Dynamo forums ](https://forum.dynamobim.com/), and your local Dynamo User Group (if there is one in your locale). Understand the flow of data through vanilla Dynamo. Download some packages like Rhythm or Lunchbox, and start to understand the solutions that others have already figured out, and how to interface with these packages. The Dynamo forums are fantastic, and you'll often get answers to your questions within an hour of posting. *Finally, start to pull it all together. Write some basic Python nodes to do things that vanilla Dynamo doesn't do well (or does confusingly), like if-then statements or for- loops. Try to build a basic concept using just Dynamo nodes, then figure out how you might do it better in a Python script. You'll probably need to learn or at least reference some DesignScript to help implement methods in your Python script. Use (Revit API Docs)[http://www.revitapidocs.com/] for reference here. Best of luck!
Damn right it does. Kidding, thanks! Still much work to be had. Wasted a few hours setting it up for presentation after the original post since it runs headless.
this... is scary
&gt; You do need to explicitly import subpackages and submodules, but functions and things defined in a module don't need their own imports. They don't require explicit imports but it is beneficial as missing functions and things would raise an import errors right on start time instead of an attribute on the module error later. It also saves a bunch of the attribute lookups if you have hot code. 
Meh, most of this is misunderstanding or resistance to change. For point 3: in `foo/bar/__init__.py` put stuff like `from foo.bar.baz import *`. Although `*` it is bad form; only import explicit instead of implicit namespace clobbering. 
I checked it out, but Reportlab being as comprehensive as it is, I really don't see the need for PyFPDF.
Stupid question: how do you make your computer triggers reCAPTCHA in a reliable way? Anyway looks really good congrats! If you look for a job, we are probably hiring at SerpApi.com. 
There's a job post thread stickied to the top of this subreddit
So what is the technique here? Something like Selenium to control a bunch of browsers? How do you get the sound? Intercepting the requests or recording what is played?

Published an article about applying [multiple linear regression](https://datatofish.com/multiple-linear-regression-python/) with a functional GUI to allow users input the independent variables and get the predicted result...
I'm not really sure what you're saying here. Barring any shenanigans with import hooks, you can only import modules and packages. You can't import functions. Unless you're talking about `from` imports, in which case yeah, but that's not what the OP doing.
One problem I ran into was using large (by my standards...) datasets for training. You're supposed to use a generator to yield batches to train on, but documentation is rather vague on what you're supposed to return. The code I forked would randomly pick n elements from the training set and return them as a batch, which meant that an X+y pair could show up multiple times per epoch. I changed that into a system where the generator shuffled the input so the order is random, and it would then use slicing to return each(-ish) element only once per epoch. This follows the "an epoch is one iteration over the training data" philosophy. With the old generator, loss would start where you expected it, and would then start dropping. With the new generator, my loss suddenly experienced a floating point overflow and became inf, which I wasn't expecting to be possible because my targets are in the -1 to 1 range. I shelved the whole thing at that point, will have to return to it later.

i usually prefer the newly added f strings which are included from python 3.6 onwards
I work in the healthcare field. We use C# for our webservices and applications. Javascript for our newer apps. VB for our older uglier apps. Some people have had a little experience with python but not many. It's pretty popular for machine learning &amp; data science however.
I started to use black, and so far I am happy with the results. I think black has a correct approach, that there shouldn't be configuration, because the goal is that python code should visually looks the same, so one can focus on the meaning of the code. I hope it will be adopted more widely. Anyway, any code formatter is better than none.
I read this as "Pip changed something unexpectedly and is now broken". It doesn't matter if it's other packages that caused it to break or not. The fact remains that it worked before I upgraded it. *That's a sign of a bad upgrade.* 
I take advantage of Chrome DevTools Protocol, sending commands and receiving events through websocket. I use an unofficial Python port of Puppeteer called, as you'd probably guess, Pyppeteer. Selenium was my first try but it didn't provide a way to properly inject Javascript before page loads which is crucial in evading/mocking browser fingerprinting. It's all automated, it normally runs (is tested) in headless mode - no graphical interface.
O was actually looking for something like this recently. Thank you.
We were talking about importing stuff yes.
Thanks for the TL;DR! I was looking only for the main idea.
It makes much more sense than the alternative. Explicit, absolute imports are the most pythonic way of doing things; unambiguous, easy to refactor, independent of context and so on.
Ah cool. But how do you get the at the sound?
Surprisingly there is a ton of stuff going on before the actual page loads. I modify a bunch of window.navigator parameters to mimick another browser and device. And not all pages show reCaptcha until necessary so I inject the reCaptcha widget with their sitekey on page load under their domain. Thanks very much, it's been such a fun task that I prefer to keep cracking away at it instead of sleeping (don't recommend)! I will take your suggestion into consideration and check you guys out! Thanks again
Oh man. Pretty sure one of my sites is using PyPDF right now. Really wish there was a reliable library for PDF. I know there's ReportLab, but it seems like it focuses more on PDF generation than munging which is what I need to do.
I'm not following, what sound are you speaking of? If you mean the video, I captured it with Gifox soit's only an image - no sounds!
In the gif it looks like it uses the audio captcha, where there is a giant Play button and it says "Enter the words you hear"
The general idea for such tasks is that you need to do some normalization first. So, in your example, you'd need to disambiguate \`Age 5\-10\` as \`Age 5, Age 6, Age 7, Age 8, Age 9, Age 10\`. Second, if there are multiple categories, such, as, say, \`Age\` and \`Weight\`, then you'd need to, for example, sort by categories, making sure that when you compare two structures, you compare ages to ages and weights to weights. You would also, probably want to assign scores to differences you find, e.g. missing the entire row of \`Age\` is worse than missing just one \`Age 5\` field and so on. I don't believe there are out of the box tools that will give you scores and edit distances for structured data... but, specifically for XML, XSLT may be useful for the normalization part.
Yeah, sorry haha. Read my edit. If you have anymore questions shoot away. I can't reveal too much but I'm happy to indulge a bit. 
Glad we were able to help! 
Scraper returned 2/3 results I searched. The song lyrics for the song that did not show its results are online and can be found, so I’m not sure what database your code is scraping it’s data from, but it’s for the most part it’s accurate and works! Thanks for sharing! 
This is reasonable only if you need basic layout or have a lot of free time. I use [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/) for complex layouts, brochures because clients these days want pdf with bootstrap, js and emojis
If you turned this into 30 people on the screen, you could use this to treat stage fright and give people a tool to practice speaking in front of others. 
Thanks for pointing me towards this project. I have never heard of it before. Do you know if there is an easier way to either play from a text file or edit the *.cast file that is created by making a recording? This way I can get rid of typos and edit the recording without having to redo it? I recorded a pretty simple example (3 lines) and the cast file was 262 lines long and very difficult to interpret. If the recordings created by asciinema aren't easily modifiable, it really can't be used as an alternative to the script I wrote. I use Peek with this script to create GIFs. It looks like if anything, asciinema could serve as an alternative to Peek.
Ah I see, you intercept the audio file request. I wonder what they did for browser fingerprinting. And why this isn't a a thing, like, if you and the other poster can rig this then wouldn't the professional spammers be able to do the same?
Thanks for the comment, glad we were able to help! 
Used PyPDF for *reading* pdfs with 3.6 and had no trouble with it - so it seems to work fine.
OP is trying to import a function using a qualified import statement, not a from import.
thank you 
Thanks for your feedback. I actually directly scraping lyrics from [www.metrolyrics.com](https://www.metrolyrics.com) . Maybe [www.metrolyrics.com](https://www.metrolyrics.com) doesn't contain the lyrics you requested. And I'm not using any database. Just a string variable containing the scraped lyrics.
I don't intercept it, not in that way at least. I scrape the url from the frames source and then download it over another library with the same proxy (else I get 400 error). And truth be told, I'm still not sure what exactly they use for browser fingerprinting - but I am quite confident in what they don't check for. :) Some use actual workers but offload overload to the automative routes I believe. One service I know of is based on completely automated solving but their servers(or lack of) suck and can't handle enough threaded connections to be reliable. It's why I ended up coding one myself. If I were to guess why all of them don't do it this way, well then there is a good chance this way wouldn't work anymore. Humans can always solve without (much) downtime unlike having to play cat and mouse in automation with Google.
There's an update out called PyPDF2. I use that one, personally
Any thoughts on Bokeh? Wanna learn this as my next package but if someone has wise words to steer me away please fire away
Please do! :) Mimicking a buggy browser and device is enough to trigger ReCAPTCHA or you mean to help with passing the actual triggered ReCAPTCHA? Trigger I mean not just the checkbox, but the full thing. 
I written a library to create PDFs with Python a while back because I didn't like the complicated APIs that the existing ones had. It's called PyLaTeX: https://github.com/JelteF/PyLaTeX. The big difference between this library and all others is that it uses LaTeX to do the heavy lifting. Which makes the API very simple and easy to extend (it's basically all helpers to generate latex code). And it also makes it really easy to do some complicated stuff by leveraging the vast package ecosystem of LaTeX. Things such as tables that span multiple pages and images become a breeze. Examples: http://jeltef.github.io/PyLaTeX/current/examples.html
That looks like the new version of the `pip` script is finding an older version of the `pip` module. Try uninstalling pip completely and installing it afresh.
Mutool is one of the best IMO.
I think he meant "I'm not sure where you're sending your query" as opposed to wondering about a literal database. One thing you could do is have a couple different sites that you cross-check, in case one of them has a song that the others do not. Then you could even have a toggle box or buttons or something that enable/disable specific sites from being searched by your tool. 
" The fellowing skills are good to know...."
I suspect their key technique is fingerprinting your browsers read-only *coughcough* properties and giving it a unique id, as if it were your IP. Overriding/changing those properties with different values renders the fingerprinting obsolete. These values are generated to resemble as closely as possible to real, modern browsers, otherwise ReCaptcha gives you shit for it. By triggering I assumed previously you meant having the reCatpcha appear. I'm still not sure if I am reading correctly but you actually you mean the whole process of clicking things? I do a bit of error checking before acting on any element. Mostly polling(wait task) the elements typeof or in more complex areas, wrapping it in a function that'll return true conditionally. If all else fails, the poll has a set timeout that'll throw exception if no positive result was reached. I think that's right at least... feel free to ask for clarification.
You couldn’t have used cats?
hahah yes on prod servers absolutely. been doing pipeline work for a large vfx production facility for the last year. stopping supervisord workers and starting them up in pdb is common practice (that i've put in place). it's an industry where we like to fly on the edge of our seats. the volume of tickets we have coming through, and the very limited number of devs means we sometimes have to do daring things with live services. it's an industry that produces flicks and dvds.. not maintaining life-support machines or flying planes. :)
No XD
Seaborn is my first choice as it has wide range of applications and can easily use it for complex visualization problems. 
Thanks for clarifying me. I will try to add the functionality to scrap couple of more lyrics websites to cross-check the lyrics as you suggested. I really appreciate your feedback. 
It's a shell tool, so you should be able to just pipe in your input. 
Mind providing a working example of that? Say I wanted the recording to run `echo "Hello World"` for example. How would I pipe that in from a text file? I'm assuming you mean something like `cat example.txt | asciinema rec test.cast`, but what would `example.txt` look like?
It works with Python 3.6. Their documentation page doesn't even show their latest release
What do you need to do with PDFs? ReportLab is great for creating them. If you need to split or merge then you might want to check out pdfrw: [https://github.com/pmaupin/pdfrw](https://github.com/pmaupin/pdfrw) You can even use pdfrw in conjunction with ReportLab, which is pretty neat!
Yeah, I think PyFPDF is for people who want something simpler than ReportLab. Yes, ReportLab has a bit of a learning curve, but it is way more powerful and has a lot more cool things built in
I haven't used pdfkit, but just looking at it I would think the main difference is that you can place items using absolute or close to absolute positioning with PyFPDF and I don't see that as an option with pdfkit.
That's actually pretty cool. I hadn't heard of it
Also if you go to PyPI, the actual latest release was in 2015 \- [https://pypi.org/project/fpdf/](https://pypi.org/project/fpdf/) Yeah, I know...still 3 years
Lol thanks for the clarification, no it was even a stupider question, how do you manage to get the full ReCAPTCHA - not just checkbox - every time? In my experience, when you solve the ReCAPTCHA once successfully, you’ll get the simpler checkbox after that, and that can be annoying when you try to code a solution for the full thing as it hinders testing. I’ll make a lot of weird requests with a bad proxy, but it seems very pedestrian lol.

cant see error because using phone but if it looks like a rounding error make sure you are using python 3
Are you not using the latest 2.7 version? If so, why?

 i ran python \-m pip uninstall pip and it found really an old version pip\-9.0.3. The error isn'T shown again and everything works fine now. Thx for your help!!!
Looks to me like your code works fine but there's something wonky with the maps/images you're using. I'm on the way out the door, but I'd check for typos if I were you. 
For a very naive reason actually. I was using a guide to build a simple app to get started, and they strictly recommended using the original 2.7 version regardless which i regret a little now. 
That's a horrible guide and you should throw it out of the window if it tells you to use Python 2.7.0 specifically. Get the latest 2.7 version, it's fully compatible with all 2.x versions before it.

Thanks for sending this over, that's why we created this post - we found that most blogs/videos went far too in-depth when we were looking to learn the basics of both to figure out which direction we should move in.
“Matplotlib” regarding functions or arrays and “networkx” for network-visualisation. 
Latitude looks correct to me. For longitude you are passing a negative number as your degrees argument then adding positive minutes and seconds. When adding the values together you should use the absolute value of the degrees argument. If you passed dms2dd(-88, 30, 0) you would want to add half a degree to 88, not -88. Then use your if statement to check if degrees is negative or positive and multiply accordingly. 
I would recommend going for a functional language like Haskell

Using a vpn does this reliably.
IIRC Process is a threaded execution of code one time where as a Pool is designed to run multiple versions of the same method across multiple pre\-created Processes. `from multiprocessing import Pool` `def f(x):` `return x*x` `if __name__ == '__main__':` `p = Pool(5) print(p.map(f, [1, 2, 3]))` `from multiprocessing import Process` `def f(x):` `print x*x` `if __name__ == '__main__':` `p1 = Process(target=f, args=(1,))` `p1.start()` `p2 = Process(target=f, args=(2,))` `p2.start()` `p3 = Process(target=f, args=(3,))` `p3.start()` `p1.join()` `p2.join()` `p3.join()`
You could recreate them all using apache superset, I think there are included templates to make a heatmap. Or refactor your existing code, fixing the issues that make it ugly.
I primarily use the online code visualizer of [http://www.pythontutor.com](http://www.pythontutor.com). It works 90&amp;#37; of the time correctly.

Making one thread per TCP socket is not going to scale well. You want to use some fancy dressings around `select`/`epoll` such as `asyncio`.

Migrating my Discord bot code over to the rewrite of discord.py. My bot is just one script currently, but as I add more features to it, it's just not sane to manage it that way. I would like the bot to have different commands for different games, so I'm trying to do it in a way that makes sense and is clean. Implementing a 'cogs' like system seems like the way to go: https://gist.github.com/EvieePy/d78c061a4798ae81be9825468fe146be
Almost all of my PDF needs involve adding or modifying existing PDFs (mostly ones converted from other formats). Adding headers, paginating, things like that. I'll look into pdfrw. Thanks!
Unfortunately I had to move on with my work, and I ended up using a RAM\-heavy alternative that works. The code that I was refering to is now deleted, as speed is paramount in my work, memory not so much. I appreciate your help though, as your post indicates I might be able to speed up the runtime by reducing the number of lookups in some sections. Thank you
Hey, GigaQubit, just a quick heads-up: **refering** is actually spelled **referring**. You can remember it by **two rs**. Have a nice day! ^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
No, Raymond never goes into too much depth, you're wrong. Raymond is a God. 
I think pdfrw + ReportLab would work great for that. You can use pdfw for overlaying PDFs too
Using your “Where I am” link, google says your input should be lat = dms2dd(35, 10, 14.6) lon = dms2dd(89, 50, 14.4) Are you using decimals in your second argument? I noticed you used 244 in your script. Should that have been 24.4? If you have seconds &gt; 60 you are increasing your minutes. 
maybe look into godot which i hear has python\-like syntax and even has a python extension so you \-\- presumably, i haven't looked \-\- can code in python.
I haven't looked at processors for years. Is everything multicore now? and if not will the multiprocessing library fall back to using threads or will it crash?

Quick comments: 1) put lines 4-123 or whatever (the definitions + properties) into an enum class in a separate file. Then, in the main file import it in. This cleans up the main file quite a bit. If you do it correctly, you'll also be able to abstract away most of 167-403 (I think) 2) import string and use string.ascii_lowercase and the equivalents for lines 129-131 3) more descriptive names 4) break up the main function into smaller self-contained functions Also, not 100% sure if this is the right subreddit for this but I might be wrong
might help if you copy-pasted some examples of said ugly code
Yeah I’m still in python 2.7 anything similar to asyncio?
Hey there! Nice job on your first project, here's some feedback: Instead of: lowerlphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' upperalphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' You can do this: import string lower_letters = string.ascii_lowercase upper_letters = string.ascii_uppercase So the biggest issue with your code is the `doStuff()` function. Anytime you have hundreds of if/elif statements like that, something is wrong. In this case, it's because your data is structured poorly. This would probably be a good place to use a dictionary. So instead of this: H = ['Hydrogen', '1', 1.008, 2.1] He = ['Helium', '2', 4.003, 0.0] ... Elements = ('H', 'He', ... ) I'd recommend you do something like this: Elements = { 'H': ('Hydrogen', '1', 1.008, 2.1), 'He': ('Helium', '2', 4.003, 0.0) ... } So all those if/elif statements can now be changed to: element = individualvalues[currentNunmberLength] numbers.append(Elements[element][2]) The next big issue is how you're parsing the given value. This is definitely a place where regex would help tremendously. A quick google search turned up [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13923354): import re re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\d*)', 'H2SO4') Those are the primary things that I saw on a quick code review. I'd be happy to look at it again if you change somethings! Just send me a PM. Hope you keep going with Python, great job on your first project!
If you have control of both ends *and* you don't need a concept of connected/not-connected, I can recommend using (http://zeromq.org/)[Zero MQ] - making a single processing loop picking up messages and dealing with them. I wrote a (https://github.com/20ft/messidge)[Library that does a bit more] but it might be overkill...
I hate matplotlib as a user too.

You may use Google Colaboratory https://colab.research.google.com/
Pool allows you more built in control over Process mapping to CPU. For instance if you have a 4 core CPU and you have a Pool(5) it will run 1 process per core and then have one left over process to put on the first available core. It will do this automatically for all supplied data and only ever have 5 processes used, with no overhead for creating and destroying the process. Do the same thing with process Process() Process() Process() Process() Process() And so on for each set in the data, well you are still only processing 4 threads at a time with your cores, but now you have the overhead of creating all these processes, managing them while they are sitting around waiting their turn on a core and destroying them each time you run the method. A pool allows you a set number of processes always laying around ready for you to use them when you call Process.Map() Where as creating and destroying a process each time you need to use it is more computationally expensive for your code as well as the CPU scheduler having to manage all those processes. Also you could have one Pool of processes for each method needing to use it, as long as they aren’t trying to map at the same time. where as a process is bound to a specific method when created, want to process a different method? Have to create a new Process each time.
1. PEP8. Read it. Use it. 2. Maybe you should include some real world examples / use cases? Throwing this knowledge at someone without telling them why it exists is a bit thin. 3. Why is this "Tutorial #04". This should be #315.
Fair enough :) My standard advice is "stick to pandas and seaborn for as long as possible". Eventually though you'll want to do something completely crazy, and matplotlib will deliver. Via an awful API, but you *can* draw anything, and I do appreciate that power when I need it. Day to day though, pandas/seaborn/xarray all the way! 
Tornado or Twisted might work in Python 2.7. But it won't be much fun. You should see if you can get Python 3.5 or newer where you have cool things like coroutines and the like.
I need to badly, how much difference between the versions is there? Any significant depreciations or refactoring that would take a lot of time to convert my current code?
| on Github Hold up there *Grandpa*... haven't you heard, *Gitlab* is where all the cool kids are hanging out these days. /S
Dict would be cleaner than an enum here though
A library like Tornado would abstract over which selector is used (`select`/`epoll`/`kqueue` etc) so that you don't have to program against a specific one.
Not sure who the previous guy is, but this has been done before with Golang: [https://github.com/TestingPens/SwarmIt](https://github.com/TestingPens/SwarmIt) He describes the process fairly well. It should be noted that the difficulty is adjusted based on the IP reputation, so it's not as easy to abuse as you'd think. 
Yeah i get that the power is there, iv'e actually made some complex \- or atleast for me complex \- things in it but it's a pita. Maybe an overlay lib for matplotlib could be an idea. The same power but through an interface that is straight forward...

Well I just started learning python a week ago tomorrow. But instead of my discord bot having to download a song from YouTube to play, stream it so it's instant instead. So if anyone knows the workings with that, let me know! Other than that continue on small projects to keep learning!

Python seems to work better with some of the FaaS services (Lambda) we're using. I haven't yet found a way to get Powershell into Lambda. That and I'm much more comfortable with python than Powershell. 
Language. 
Do I understand that correctly that these tools fix style issues for you, i.e., rewriting code to adhere to style guides in contrast to just highlighting issues? Personally, I am pretty happy with using a "highlighter" plugin \-\- I really like flake8. If you have an editor &amp; plugin where these highlighted issues really stick out, you have a strong incentive to fix them, and by manually fixing them to make the "issue messages" go away, you will become very good at not violating coding style after a short time, which is a nice, educational side\-effect. 
seems like a hybrid. I.e., XKCD style only for the labels and axes, not for the graphs itself. 
Y'all mtfs are cleaver! Great job! Do you think you can make a video explain every step? Pleaaase
Oh, whoops! I think it has something to do with reCaptcha's dashboard settings and my proxies being poop. I turn the security preference to the highest level for test cases. If I turn it down, the prevalence of having to image solve is lower.
Wish I could tell yah! 
No plans have been made to release the source code. This may change in the future after more development and, most likely after the post-beta stage of ReCAPTCHA v3. The speech API is one of the last secrets I got to hold!
Thanks for that link. I haven't yet reviewed the repository but I agree on the IP reputation part fully. 
Wish I could lead you in the right direction! Start small and work your way up is best thing I could tell you. Little goals with big plans. Practice on less trivial automating tasks, with just HTTP requests and low/no bot-detection. And slowly work your way up to the big thing.
For my news paper summary project, i converted the summarized articles into an mp3 file to listen to. it doesn't have a flow and is 10 hours long. haha it was for fun, but i dont think its useful. link below if you want to hear it. http://www.articlebits.com/newsaudio
Possibly one day! I'm not a good teacher, I think, though.
Serious question: what does this do besides cause Google to create an even-more-privacy-violating, more-annoying-to-complete CAPTCHA for actual humans to endure while signing up for things?
Hey! How does one start with automating basics tasks using Python? Any guide or resource out there? 
if you don't mind me asking, why are you using 2.7 for a new application?
A newer version of ReCAPTCHA is already in the works. https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3
Python 2.7.10 is macOS default version, i started coding this like 3 weeks ago and didn’t realize the version until this post.
Windows 10's lock screen randomizer seemed to be broken on my system when using my own images instead of their curated internet ones. So I wrote a quick C# program to change the lock screen from the command line (as you have to use the Win8\+ API for this), but then I realized the images still weren't changing. It turned out that while the source image was being correctly set, the cached versions for the current resolution (e.g. \`LockScreen\_\_\_1680\_1050\_notdimmed.jpg\`) were *never* being regenerated. Better yet, I couldn't find a solution on the internet. After some mucking about I discovered I could just take ownership of that cached file by force, delete it, and replace it with a symlink to something else (including a PNG, as the cached files Windows creates are JPGs). That ended up evolving into a Python script where it gets a list of all the artwork and cool imagery I've saved over the years, picks one at random, "frames" it if it's not a good fit for a wallpaper (low res/wrong proportions), and sets it as both the lock screen and wallpaper. Performance is okay, about .4s per run. Then I used Task Scheduler so that it runs every time I unlock the PC. It's nice to see a random selection of artwork that had previously just been sitting in folders, hoarded and never used. \[final result\]([https://i.imgur.com/8KS0DPm.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/8KS0DPm.jpg)), \[pic source\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/comments/5k3hcx/sunrise\_from\_jonsrud\_viewpoint\_in\_sandy\_oregon\_oc/](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/comments/5k3hcx/sunrise_from_jonsrud_viewpoint_in_sandy_oregon_oc/))
And this is a "big thing" right? Like, this kind of work is actually seriously challenging and requires extensive knowledge before remotely attempting? 
Just started running u/pythonHelperBot in hopes that it helps direct basic python questions to the learn python sub in a friendly fashion. Hopefully you'll never see him!: he's got restrictions to prevent spamming including never commenting on multiple posts made by the same user as well as a required time delay before posting and using votes to help its classification. This weeks tasks include: 1. Monitoring its performance to see how restrictive I need to make it 2. Moving the current form of the bot to a raspberry pi 2. Figuring out how to parse stack overflow data dumps 3. Using the parsed SO data to implement [this paper (Addressing Complex and Subjective Product-Related Queries with Customer Reviews by Julian McAuley and Alex Yang)](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/pdfs/www16b.pdf) which should make the bot's suggested 'help' more helpful. 4. Fleshing out an ethics section of the readme and maybe moving it to its own section in the documentation 4. Updating the documentation, figuring out licensing, and posting most of the code to github 4. Getting back to my regularly scheduled work with bioinformatics (largely translating a lot of the bots components to work with an alphabet of 4) Already completed this week: A simple time lapse program to try to record flowers blooming in my office. [OpenCV](http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_gui/py_video_display/py_video_display.html) and [MoviePy](https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/install.html) are wonderful 
I would mark anti-bot evading, especially up against Google, as challenging, definitely. There is a lot of stuff going on besides just the clicking on the checkbox and typing in the response going on in the backend, mostly before the page even loads!
Type this exact phrase into Google and count the hits lol
That’s great but it doesn’t really answer my question. 
I sent you a pm
If you're bored enough - would you care to explain laymans terms what kind of stuff goes on in the back end to battle against googles anti-bot stuff? If it reveals too much - then I dont want to ruin your tactics. I've just been so curious as to how code can look human.
I used your package to automate report generation for my workplace! Thanks for your contribution, it's great.

We use [ldap3](http://ldap3.readthedocs.io/) on a number of projects to talk to local AD. I imagine it works the same with Azure AD.
Finally back to working on my current pet project, which is a basic social networking site (similar in functionality to reddit). Just got profile pages up and working yesterday, but I'll probably have to add a voting system and a commenting system to it soon as well. I'm tempted to change the database from sqlite to postgres as well, I was using sqlite because I intended to run the site on a raspberry pi for fun but postgres is more professional from what I hear. Also wrote a quick script the other day to migrate an awful looking xml file to a sqlite database so I could play around with it. It was satisfying to know that my programming skills have come far enough for me to apply them in a useful manner in a more real world sense instead of just on passion projects
I mean there is the obvious use of automating registration of all kinds of accounts. The thing that reCaptcha is supposed to prevent. 
that's pretty neat, but what do you get for doing that?
Odd, I haven't received a PM on my end.
Any article on the topic should by default cover `concurrent.futures`. The interfaces for both `threading` and `multiprocessing` are comparatively ancient. 
That’s my point tho. Every attempt to circumvent human-checking algorithms on front-facing American websites since about 2015 makes you a Russian bot working for Orange Hitler, doesn’t it?
Actually what you want to do is referred to as "lazy evaluation." [Promises and futures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises) have a somewhat different meaning when looked at from a computing science point of view. (For example, they may be strictly rather than lazily evaluated, but just take time to complete.)
**Futures and promises** In computer science, future, promise, delay, and deferred refer to constructs used for synchronizing program execution in some concurrent programming languages. They describe an object that acts as a proxy for a result that is initially unknown, usually because the computation of its value is yet incomplete. The term promise was proposed in 1976 by Daniel P. Friedman and David Wise, and Peter Hibbard called it eventual. A somewhat similar concept future was introduced in 1977 in a paper by Henry Baker and Carl Hewitt. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
large scale web crawling is a major industry for a number of reasons/end goals. 
Yes, but be advised that this isn't actually a viable solution (sorry OP, no offense meant) for any kind of large\-scale web crawling. The more requests you make to a website, the more datapoints you give them to identify you as a robot. There's a whole industry built around detecting and blocking, as well as the in\-house teams at orgs like google. Getting around this sort of tech is a huge problem for companies who do large\-scale crawling. Source: I worked at a company that did large scale web crawling. We spent a ton of engineering time on dealing with this problem across many websites, solving captchas is but a small part of the equation. 
whoa
Wish we could go back to text captchas. These image selection things are the most annoying captcha by far. And on sites like 4chan where you have to constantly solve them it gets really annoying really fast.
bahahaha epic answer. Curses - there goes my chance at making a sneaker bot solo T_T. Still gonna learn python the whole way through. Maybe I can learn to make a crypto trading bot.
What's your solve accuracy rate?
I have an [example](https://gist.github.com/agentphantom/112a0bf654ec2c58577daf697f7592e7) on how to save data from an API to a SQLite database. In Python there's a specification for database drivers that makes them super easy to switch. The code I linked uses SQLite, but with very little effort you can change it to MySQL. My recommended approach is to create a "master list", where you first store all your data already modeled (as lists or tuples). Then you will call the insertmany() method, this makes the script insert all your data in one go, saving a significant amount of time. For websites that don't offer an API you will have to fallback to web scraping. You will require to know how to use these libraries: * BeautifulSoup * Requests * Selenium * Scrapy For websites that have an API, you will only require to read their documentation, most commonly you will use: * Requests * websockets - json (built in one on python 3.5+ is good enough)
I'll bet it's Google's, isn't it :P
No offense taken, thanks for the criticism! On the other hand, I've tested with hovering over, focusing on elements before clicking with a random delay and "human-like" mouse movements. This had no real noticeable difference on the rate of success. Many other no/reCAPTCHA research papers came to this conclusion as well. So I've removed them for now and stuck with mimicking other browser and hardware fingerprints and killing peer-to-peer transactions... 
If you mess this up, you're going to cause a lot of self-driving cars to crash.
Multiprocessing simply spawn multiple processes to your OS, the OS does its job of sharing those processes between the cores. If you only have one core, your OS will run everything on it.
You can install Python 3.6, and use the latest instead.
Workers that end up with a bot detected error are reran with different configurations. Upon getting to the audio deciphering, the accuracy is about 96%. Sometimes the speech-to-text only deciphers part of the audio. Working on noise cancellation/increasing dBs and then reloading a new audio on failures. Much more to do to make this production ready.
I resonate especially with that second paragraph. With on the DB side, usually I'm making/using Microsoft SQL DBs, the other day MySQL and then SQLite came up when I needed a DB in my application. Do I know about the differences between the DBs? Not at all. 
Do you think I can highlight individual numbered routes on Open Street Map? I'm looking into it, but isn't immediately apparent or is there a way that Open Street Map will just tell me the coordinates for the routes kind of like what ODOT gave me? Also, how accurate do you think this would be? I know Google maps has at least one mistake compared to my map so OSM might be worse. Thanks for your time :)
Just updated my toy language project \-\- a compiler written in Python using LLVM by way of the llmvlite library: [https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang](https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang) There's working examples (Conway's Life, for instance) in the project repo. I just today added a way to derive compile\-time constants, by performing what amounts to a mini\-JIT pass on constant blocks. LLVM makes that possible; Python makes that easy.
I'm afraid I don't know. I know they have a big wiki and I think a user forum somewhere you could ask. 
Nope. It's even less friendly to Python than Wordpress. Satya has been getting heaps of press about the GitHub purchase and I'm just hoping the .NET API is here soon or they hire me to help build it for you. pv
I play a lot of modded Minecraft and my primary OS is Linux. Twitch/Curse still doesn't have a proper Linux client and at this rate probably never will. I love and highly recommend the MultiMC launcher, but there are a few features it doesn't have, such as easily updating modpacks and notifying of new versions available. So I started making my own rudimentary launcher with Python. I'd love to explain more and post the code I've written so far, but I think it might actually be against [Twitch's TOS](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/terms-of-service/) so I'll probably need to abandon the project and move on to something else.
Thanks for the reply. Correct me if I am wrong, but this still seems like a local server i.e. I can't access the API using another computer on another network. I am relatively new top Python/programming so I may be missing something
Depends on where you run it. I’d suggest digital ocean, as you can easily spin up a “droplet” with Python 3 and install your dependencies.

&gt; Do I know about the differences between the DBs? Not at all. Yeah from the limited amount I looked at, sqlite seems to be fine for my project but I figured it would be good to know the tradeoffs, especially if it ever came up in an interview environment. It's just another thing to stick on the resume as well The quick script I wrote up is one of those things that I won't throw on a resume (maybe github though) and is more of a personal satisfaction thing. It was a bit of an "aha moment" where it really clicked that what I've learned can come in useful and isn't all theory or a grade for some course
resent. let me know if this one didn't get through.
Creating an autonomous robot that drives around without hitting any objects. It uses HCSR04 ultrasonic sensors, a Raspberry Pi, and dc motors. I am using python to control every aspect of the robot.
The new image reCaptcha is useless against bot and hard for humans. Google uses as its own mech turk and made it only to enrich its self-driving car dataset.
Is there a sauce?
Got it, replied!
Shit, that new version is literally going to watch every damn move of every human or robot on every website it's installed. 
Learning Selenium right now, trying to scrape job postings on indeed so this will probably be something I will run into down the line. Cool 
I strongly agree with this. Even though concurrent.futures is using threading and multiprocessing under the hood, it covers a very common use case. If your use case can fit into it's design, it is a pleasure to use. 
Once you start doing hundreds of thousands per hour it gets much more difficult. You still need to solve the captchas, but lots of other factors come into play. We had rotating pools of thousands of proxies and other stuff to make it harder to tell it was us, we still got blocked regularly and had to workaround. Using an automated clicky type solve or browsing method are very expensive to scale, we'd only use them when absolutely necessary (ie when our block rate with other methods became unacceptably high)
Props
The trick is using malware and having your hacked net act as your agents, duh. /s please don't hurt me.
Yeah, without proxies it would be a deadend within about 8 request or so. I have a large pool of proxies I rotate through, up to 20,000.
This is spam. Use the report button everyone.
Good Job, but can we all atleast accept the fact how ridiculous most of those reCaptchas are. It's sometimes unbearable for me. WBU guys ?

Yeah
So its like... google analytics?
How much does that cost you? 
http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~polakis/papers/sivakorn_eurosp16.pdf Look at section 4.1.
This. The best solution would be to actually avoid solving anything (by passing the "I am not a robot" checkbox). Using a headless browser would be a last-resort option.
&gt; The speech API is one of the last secrets I got to hold! Really? I was under the impression the audio recognition was the easiest part.
If performance is an issue, you should really consider taking key pieces of your program and cythonizing them. This can result in 2x to 400x+ speedups. Cython can also get around the GIL which means it can actually efficiently utilize multiple cores for large processing jobs. For example, when I'm processing a huge body of text, I run the sentence and word tokenization through my multi-processing Cython library of text functions. Dealing with internet, you focus would probably be more on multi-threading which I have far less experience doing, and if you are only dealing with very small packets of data and not doing anything interesting to them, then multi-processing might actually be a performance detriment since it takes overhead time to initiate the processes.
There is no hardware and no OS that's optimized for python. Just pick the best computer you can afford. If you want speed you should make changes to your program. For the ultimate speed you will rewrite it in C. Otherwise show your program to /r/learnpython and ask for recommendations to speed it up. 
I've got my stuff running on a 10 yo mid-range (at the time laptop). Arch Linux without a desktop environment works great. Ethernet over USB really shouldn't add much delay at all IMO, and since your sending small amounts, I don't think you'll hit the cap of USB 2.0 throughput anytime soon. 
This post is better suited for r/learnpython 
thank you, just posted there
It is, haha. I'm being a twat.
You nailed it. Their analysis was reviewed intensively for this project.
But is that really what you want to do? Fixing style issues? All the time you do this you are not writing the actual code. 
Possible yes. But likely to be complicated. The easy part is the philibs hue API which allows a python script to control your lights. The part that I don’t know is somehow having python monitor your browser for which websites you are using. My first guess would be some kinda packet that monitors your internet activity and respond accordingly. One problem you may run into would be lights switching if you are using multiple browser tabs. That can be pretty irritating if you are like me and hob from one thing to another. Unless you are a super focused person who wouldn’t consider checking his email while reading a book. I would say try to control your lights from an app first then try to automate it Great project idea though 
It’s 2.7.10 from what I’ve heard (haven’t upgraded myself). I’d advise everyone to pretend it doesn’t exist and install what you have to install. You should at some point anyway.
You can have both versions on your system at the same time. 
Nothing layman about it unfortunately. You need to deep dive on web tech and internet tech to understand.
Yeah but their AI already got all the data they needed for reading books, now they’re training image recognition and driving. 
They provide a automatic code conversion tool that covers 99&amp;#37; of the work. Conversion should be more or less seamless unless you used questionable logic somewhere. 
Dont forget to get proper cooling if you run 24/7 under full load. 
Some languages are better at certain things than other ones. Since the technology you are focusing on is mainly web browser based I would recommend creating a Chrome/FireFox plugin that can do this. You will have a much easier time than doing anything in Python
For an added challenge, implement hitting multiple lyric sites asynchronously. You will reduce execution time and have happier users.
I wrote some code [here](https://pastebin.com/1buq1V20) to assign electoral votes shortly after the 2016 election. The same process should be applicable here.
Thank you for this kind stranger! It helped in getting a general idea how to approach this problem
I guess I'm asking for an ELI5.
Thanks!
ELI15-Google tracks everything you do the moment you load a webpage. Using probability and machine learning they can predict within reasonable doubt if you're a bot based on your actions. They have different tiers of detection based on frequency of your actions.
If you can choose OS and care about speed that much: write a Python extension in Rust or Go. Writing extensions in C, C++ or Fortran is too error prone (will take you longer to get right). OS, in itself, doesn't matter that much, since your program, the way you describe it, will be I/O bound. What will matter is the configuration: i.e. you will need to figure out the optimal IP kernel module settings. I never had to modify anything beyond MTU, but I'm not really an expert in this area. Obviously, you'd need an OS that allows you to configure these settings :)
Is Ironpython a different form of python? Or are just a few commands different?
Thank you!
Why do you need to be real-time? What does your program do? (20 seconds? Consider Amazon lambda and you don't need a computer at all. 0.1 seconds? Geographic distribution is more important than compute power, so go cloud again) A raspberry pi 3 is actually a lot faster than my desktop from 2005, and for kilobytes of memory I would expect most of the delay to be network transport rather that processing the data. Have you measured the performance of your program? My suggestion would be to start by running on a raspi or a cheap cloud instance, and only upgrade if you've profiled it and can precisely describe the problem. 
is it bad if you use all three?
lmfao i know this. I'm asking what is the bot "thinking" and then "doing" that makes another bot (their bot detectors) think its a human? 
Some detectable Bot shit - erratic movement of mouse cursor, instant entry in for fields or entry in a very specific amount of time, doesn't wait for the whole webpage to load before slamming into the I'm not a human button,coming from an IP address range that's known for bots, being too perfect at the captcha even on multiple failures,doesn't give up and reload the webpage in frustration when the captcha pops the text to speech recognition engine etc etc. Also the techniques used to create the bot inevitably leave fingerprints and they're aware of that too
Why not just use SSH to control your server? Why on Earth would you want to allow arbitrary commands to be sent to your machine from the web?! All fun and games until someone drops a: import os os.system("rm -rf *.*") and kamikazes your whole install lmao 
Boooooosh! That makes more sense. Gotcha. Alrighty thank you! :) 
I've stopped working on this: https://github.com/wvxvw-traiana/pykubectl as soon as I realized that it will never work on MS Windows. But its `setup.py` might get you some ideas.
Instead of doing this: del individualvalues[len(individualvalues) - 2], you can just put del individualvalues[-2]. Since Python indexing starts with a 0, the last element will have index len(individualvalues) - 1, so len(individualvalues) - 2 is the second to last element. A negative index just starts you off on the right of the iterable (but the "first" element from the right has index -1, not 0!).
Pretty pennies. It's not cheap but they are multi-purposed and the ROI is great.
Why is it spam? Usually I'm good at identifying it
I am sorry, actually i am new to Reddit so I didn't knew about it. I'll be carefull next time. Thank you so much.

&gt; Do I understand that correctly that these tools fix style issues for you, i.e., rewriting code to adhere to style guides in contrast to just highlighting issues? Yes, at least black does that. I normally write code which is already formatted, usually the exception is function calls with more parameters... I write them into one long line, and then by Shift-Ctrl-F black will reformat it. After a few days of usage, one forgets about coding style.
I am working on my OS project for Python library to parse config with evaluator functionality. https://github.com/kororo/conff 
Feel free to join the chat guys. Any feedback suggestions are welcomed :)
I've been thinking about this for a while too. ConfigParser has limited evaluation capability already but it's not particularly flexible. Have you thought about using an off-the-shelf parsing library rather than hand-rolling the parser?
hi @bqw74, I was looking at configparser, i would say it is powerful in its own and features. however, the conff library is heavily rely on YAML as base config parser. Because with only YML, it is already achieved the feature we want as parser. From there, I combined with other awesome projects such as simpleeval. In the end, I have conff. I added Jinja2 also :) Feel free to join the gitter chat. I am happy to take more features and share ideas. 
Where do you rent these proxies?
That is interesting. If you look at their post history it is an account that literally does nothing but self-promotes its own content.
&gt; It should be noted that the difficulty is adjusted based on the IP reputation VPNs and tor always get captcha all hot and bothered it seems. I've never had to solve more "which pics contain street signs" than then.
I could imagine using a mix of black and then autopep8, even though it won't be needed because black is trying to fix all issues. Instead of relying on different tools choose the simplest way which is either one of the code formatters.
A code formatter comes in really useful in a team. You will have fewer discussions on where spaces should be, where a new line should be inserted and so on and faster pull request processes. Also, a nice positive side-effect is that you will have less merge conflicts because of style changes like these. With a pre-commit hook, you also do not rely on the developer's editors, rather on tooling like git which everyone in the team is using.
Got it!
You indeed **can** use multithreading in Python. You also can use **multiprocessing** in Python, to take advantage of the power of all your cores. The first one is somehow thread safe (thanks to the GIL) and variables are shared between threads. The second one will require communication between thread to using queues or other messaging technics, because the variables are not shared between threads. Depending on what your program does, it could be very easy to implement. If you go for multithreads or multiprocess solutions, then you'd better stick with Linux.
If you don't take the time to make your problem readable, nobody will sacrifice they're time to help you.
If I'm reading your question right you need to specify the host and port in the run method App.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000) to get it to listen on the non localhost addresses of your system. You then need to open that port on the host firewall if it has one, and set up the port to be forwarded at the edge of the network to the internal server, such as your home WiFi router or the network security group and public IP in Azure, wherever it is you're running the app. If you want to listen to a port under 1024 you'll need to either use a reverse proxy in front of it like uwsgi and nginx or Apache. Or is setcap (Linux) or equivalent for your OS to permit a user process to open a privileged port. 
You should read the book "Python for Data Analysis" thoroughly. Otherwise you might miss a lot.
Well, you can easily retrieve the url of your raw files from github and load the file on your computer using pandas and requests modules [like this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32400867/pandas-read-csv-from-url).
The syntax is the same than Python 2.7.
Not from a Jedi.
I went to south India around 2013. In Chennai a lot of cars didn't have wing/side view mirror and bumpers. I don't know if my friend is joking or not, but he said in Southern India, insurance doesn't cover those mirrors and bumpers. Thats why they always honk in the road. 
Check out dictionaries :) they're exactly what you need here. Happy to give more info, but since it's for a class I recommend doing some research on them and experimenting and coming back here if you get stuck. Happy coding 
Nice. Now when Google catches wind of this, we can probably expect more ridiculous captchas
I do, but it can’t have lyrics. As nerdy as it sounds, there’s an artist named Master Boot Record that I basically put on repeat. I have a difficult time getting into the flow state without music, I get distracted too easily even if there are no other sounds.
LOL, awesome :)
Nice tutorial! Very useful, thank you!
Yeah same, I listen to music but no lyrics. Basically just some piano stuff
All the time, I like metal and hip hop so usually that. It helps me concentrate and usually signals to users (we share the same office) that I am busy coding. 
Lol, especially now it's going to be "MicroHub"
What would also be cool, is to use something like the Google Cloud Text To Speech API and create the lyrics yourself :), from scratch :). Just curious how accurate the service would be :p.
Yes, dictionaries. And random.choice(). And lists. I just wrote a quick "Guess the Color" game for one of my robots to help train it in response processing that does almost exactly what you're looking to do. But rather that just give it to you, come back here with your code and show us what you've learned. Are you in Python 2.7 or 3+? You'll need to generate the random choice, take user input, check input against choice, keep score, etc. You'll need to know how to use dictionary keys and values, and get one from the other. Bonus points for giving it a memory of which countries it's picked already with random.choice() and checking this list to prevent duplicating a country call. Good luck, looking forward to seeing your progress.
I think anaconda or miniconda are very nice. You can still use pip install from the conda terminal to add other packages.
When did all "data science" articles become such clickbait? I love some of TowardsDataScience's content, but it's becoming a BuzzFeed for programming.
As the others have said; * dictionaries * if else 
Classical or more modern stuff? Any recommendations?
All lol. I also listen to some mc music, that stuff is super relaxing
Programming is all about problem solving. You write programs to solve some kind of problem (problems can be like, "show a webapp" or "solve a math problem"). So when you say you cannot figure out how to do it, it just means that you need to break down your problem further. So let's try it. This you what you said: &gt; I chose to write a script that prints the name of a country (preferably in random order), and then the user has to give the corresponding capital of said country. Then it calculates your grade based on how many of these are correct. But I just cannot figure out how to do it. You already did the first step which is to describe how you imagine the program should work. Let's just turn it into bullet points. 1. I chose to write a script that prints the name of a country (preferably in random order), 2. and then the user has to give the corresponding capital of said country. 3. Then it calculates your grade based on how many of these are correct. Let's start with the first step. You say you have this to get started with: countries = ["Netherlands", "UK", "Germany" ] capitals = ["Amsterdam", "London", "Berlin"] nr = [1, 2, 3] First of all, your `nr` list is wrong. Remember that Python uses **zero-based** indexing (compare to say MATLAB, which uses **one-based** indexing). If you `print(countries[1])`, you're probably expecting it to print `"Netherlands"` but it will print `"UK"`, because `"UK"` is the **1st** element of the list, and `"Netherlands"` is the **0th** element. So aside from that, what you have here works, but it's not very modern. If you were writing the program in say regular C or Fortran then this is what you'd do (access elements of an array via an index, and hope that the order will never change), but you can do better in Python. What you have is a **key = value** pair. The **key** is "Netherlands", and the **value** is "Amsterdam". In Python, you could use a `dict` for this (no example given, because you can look it up yourself :)). So now you have a way to randomly print a country's name and you want the user to type in the name of the capital. The problem you are now trying to solve is how to get inputs from a user, because you've already solved the first problem. If you Google for "how to get user inputs in python" then you'll find hundreds of pages explaining just that. So by now, you've printed a country name, asked the user for an input, and presumably you know how to check if it's correct or not. The question is now how do you keep score? If you ask me 10 questions, and I get 10 right, then that's 10/10 = 1 (and then you'd times it by 100 to get 100%). If I got 2 questions right, then that's 2/10 = 20%. Basically you just need to know how many questions you've asked, and how many I've got correct. So every time I get an answer right, you can increment a `number_correct` variable, and in the end divide it by a `number_asked` variable. The last thing is that you'll want to ask multiple questions, so you need a way to do this *in a loop*. Google "python for loop" to get started. I hope this helps a bit.
Yes, I am never concentrated when I listen to my favourite lyrical songs, as I do know the upcoming lyrics. My mind get diverted towards the song.
I generally listen to yiruma. It has a relaxing feel.
Aren't you distracted towards the song and murmur the lyrics?
Useful! I’ve always found matplotlib a bit confusing when dealing with large datasets with loads of variables. Customizable in a lot of ways, but also very restrictive. For example, sometimes I need to sort the data in a certain way or rotate the label a certain angle without weird spacing and I find it quite challenging to do this with matplotlib. So I really only use it as a last resort, which means I forget how to use it, so this is most helpful. Thanks for sharing!
Oooh me too. And also yann tiersen, nobuo uematsu, and philip glass. I’m looking for new stuff though. Let me know if someone else comes to mind 🙂
Others have already said enough, but I'll add: there's a more suitable subreddit for your questions - feel free to head over to /r/learnpython :) 
Playlist with alot of songs from Audiomachine, Two Steps from Hell and some themes/songs from popular games. Cant be lyrics. I need something in the background or else i will be too distracted.
Couldn’t you of used this to farm crypto currencies? Such as RaiBlock when it was initially released.
&gt; When you import a sub-package's module (`from bar import baz`), it doesn't automatically import all the member attributes from `baz` (such as `baz.var1`, `baz.func1`, etc.), you'll have to do that explicitly in the `foo/bar/__init__.py` file like this: import baz.var1 import baz.func1 This isn't right, and it depends entirely on how you've defined those `__init__.py` modules. If I had a package like so foo/ # main package __init__.py foo_functions.py bar/ # subpackage __init__.py bar_functions.py Then presumably I would want to define `foo/__init__.py` with something like # foo/__init__.py from .foo_functions import * Now when I `import foo`, I will also import everything defined in `foo_functions.py`, and will be able to call them like `foo.my_foo_function()` in my code. Let's say that you have a function in `bar_functions.py` that you also want to include in `foo` when I `import foo`. You can do that by adding it to `foo/__init__.py`. # foo/__init__.py from .foo_functions import * from .bar.bar_functions import my_bar_function Now you can call `my_bar_function` like `foo.my_bar_function()`. You could at this point also call `foo.bar.bar_functions.my_bar_function()`, because the interpreter has imported the `foo.bar.bar_functions` module. Why would you ever want to do this? For example, say that you wrote some functions in `bar` that are essentially optional and requires extra dependencies that aren't mandatory. You don't want the user to import these extra things without them explicitly doing so, because you don't want to require those extra dependencies just to install and use `foo` for whatever reason. In this case, you wouldn't import anything from `bar` into `foo/__init__.py`, but instead you'd add the following to the subpackage # foo/bar/__init__.py from .bar_functions import * Now when I do import foo I only get the `foo` functions. If I want the bar functions, I need to import foo.bar as bar bar.my_bar_function()
It might help if you made a code example of what you mean. You could even run that code sample and see the answer for yourself. Yes, C has access to attributes and methods defined on A, unless B has explicitly overridden them.
Ive been doing python for about two years - an hour or so a nice with a few months break I between but only really have a scratch the surface knowledge of what all this and it's accompanying terminology means - are there any resources I could get into to help me understand this I more depth?
Wish I could tell yah. Wank. 
You didn't wanna take 2 seconds to try it out yourself? https://repl.it/repls/WonderfulUselessFreesoftware
😂
Its very productive especially if theres noise around you. I recommend game/movie/anime soundtracks. * Skyrim * Deus Ex: Human Revolution * Lord of the Rings * The Witcher * Super Meat Boy * FullMetal Alchemist * ...
Music tend to distract me... but some background noise or soundscape such as those found on [mynoise](https://mynoise.net/) tend to help me focus.
I'm way too distracted without music. I can do music with lyrics but I have to know the song well, otherwise I just try to interpret the lyrics, which can be hard for me with metal, and I can't have it as a background.
Video game muaic is the best choice as it is designed to keep your focus on the game(or your programming)

I've never heard of Cython before. Any suggestion on where to start? Also what would be the best way to check and see if Cython offers any performance improvements? Most of the processing on my code happens in less than a second already.
Thanks! I'll try to work something out once I get the chance.
The whole point of NoSQL is to scale to more people but a desktop app can’t have more than one user, so it’s pointless. If you just want a simple key-value object store, then use SQLite and have a table called Objects with two columns, key and object_json (or whatever other serialization format). 
You’re asking for quite a lot… do you have any background in statistics/are you able to do that stuff you want to do by hand or know the general ideas? If not you should probably start there and just focus on the methodology and forget about the coding (until you understand what you’re doing). But do get you started, just try loading in your data frame and calling the data frame’s “describe” method. If you’ve got your data organized properly that is. Machine learning is a bit more difficult, but for example here’s a link with more than enough information http://ciml.info/
Thank you, I don't have access to my 0c where I am, never knew of an online IDLE, that hel0s for the future, thanks
I think my order of preference is actually: 1. Absolutely quiet with a door closed and low lighting 2. Music when it starts to get noisy 3. Headphones when I'm at the (wtf why are people still making open office configurations?!?) office
&gt; write a Python extension in Rust or Go I have never heard of either of these. Can you tell me more?
Dude this is solid stuff (just looked them up). I definitely see myself smashing out some code to these guys.
Eh sometimes it depends on how productive I am trying to be. For me if I am just trying to make a night out of it and relax and code in a stress free environment I will put on music. If I am working I won't. Lots of different genres, to many to list but I basically put on whatever I am into at the time.
No problem. Don’t be afraid to respond again for help if you’re stuck!
I find that non vocal Jazz helps, anything from classics like Miles Davis and Bill Davis to new artists like the Bad Plus, badbadnotgood, Portico Quartet. It just has an energy and forward momentum that gets me in the right head space. 
Well I’m glad you learned something new!
Try 'thepianoguys' they have some awesome music.
Musics from a band that speaks a language that you don't understand are good too. Because you don't always pay attention to the lyrics.
I'm not him, but no. I used to listen to metal music basically all day in high school and it kept me from going insane. Teachers would get onto me if they saw my eatbuds, but I was definitely more focused with music than without. It helps if I'm listening to music I've heard before, too
This is a math question, not a python question … To answer the part about `/` and `//`, consider the following Python 3+ &gt;&gt;&gt; 1/2 0.5 &gt;&gt;&gt; 1//2 0 &gt;&gt;&gt; int(1/2) 0 &gt;&gt;&gt; 2/1 2.0 &gt;&gt;&gt; 2//1 2

Cython is basically python code that is precompiled (first into c code, then machine code). You can start with just renaming a .py module to .pyx and using "import pyximport; pyximport.install()" before importing it into your main python program. For code that needs more optimization, especially inner loops, you can declare static typing with c variable types. This can sometimes result in up to 400x speed increases since the c types don't have/need the flexibility of the native python variable types. Support is native within a distribution like anaconda, though you do need to make sure you have a c compiler working on your machine (especially for windows) https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/quickstart/
For online coding, might I also suggest looking into hosted jupyter notebooks. Both Google and Microsoft offer them for free. https://colab.research.google.com/ https://notebooks.azure.com/ Both sites have example “notebooks” to get you started and to see what it’s all about. It’s very useful for doing quick things like what you asked about but also for visualizing data, exploring data, or prototyping code. You can always convert the notebook into a python file later. 
Totally agree. I like to listen to Fela Kuti, Sunny Ade'. I've been using http://radiooooo.com/ playing Nigeria from the 60's and 70's
Very nice! I maxed out at ~65% before focusing on just not getting hit with reCaptcha at all instead
Lol
Like d_thinker says, tinydb! I've used it in multiple projects, it's so easy to integrate into your code, easy to copy tables, easy to work with.
I just finished my first real program that does something for work \- I can give it a list of postal codes and it will tell me the exact number of houses from a postal service database I work with. Super, super useful for me. Before I had to do it in excel which was a pain because the database is about 1M lines and excel is not meant for that. My program just needs the postal code list file and the db file (a monster fixed width txt file.....), then spits out the total and creates a summary CSV of the details. Now I am working on a new program to process transaction data into summary statistics to build CSVs and eventually charts in django for a website. I am having a hard time wrap my head around pivot tables in pandas and exactly how to get the data summarized in the right format...just gotta keep at it tho.
Unfortunately my experience is that AzureAD is a completely different service and would require it's own library. Thank you for the reply though!
Thanks :))
I see what you mean, but I think sometimes the point of NoSQL is not to scale, but to fit the data structure. Personally I deal with configuration data that really doesn't fit relational databases so I use MongoDB. Not for scaling but because it fits naturally to my data. When I began, I started with SQLite and then MySQL but found myself fighting it all the time because it didn't fit the data. I don't have a perfect answer for the OP, but I can see where NoSQL could be a real need even without scaling. If I had to do it, I would probably use a JSON store or possibly BSON, depending on what needed to be serialized. 
As a few other people here - music with no lyrics: * brain.fm * Epic Mountain * Infected Mushroom * Jonas Hellborg * Philip Glass * Marek Bilinski * Ronald Jenkees * classical * hell of a lot of electronica * soundtracks 
You can create a Chrome extension that kicks off a local python script. Then have the rest of the logic (Hue API) in the python script. But like said earlier, it would be easier to write this in the extension directly.
I work in an open office and have found that playing white noise through noise canceling headphones keeps me most productive.
Probably in the minority with this one, but for some reason I’m able to concentrate better with Frank Sinatra playlist on. On the other end of the spectrum, if it isn’t that, it’s something like Killswitch Engage, Tremonti, or any instrumental guitarist (Satriani, Andy Timmons, etc.). If I’m working through an actual analytical problem or challenging issue, silence is best.
&gt; I deal with configuration data that really doesn't fit relational databases How does that not fit relational databases?
In a similar vein, I really like the "Deep Focus" playlist on Spotify.
Hotline Miami sound track
I gave you an upvote for the shear “bro-ness” of how detailed and accessible your post was. No ego or “what have you tried” response. Just actual help on the internet! Kudos.
good comment
Usually yes I do, but a few pointers: * think of your ear health, having the volume too loud can leave you with permanent hearing damage and tinitus and *YOU DO NOT WANT THAT*. Keep the volume as low as you can * if you're using sealed in-ear, turn it down. No. lower than that. They are directly coupled to your ear and can pump a shocking amount of energy in * bluetooth wireless ones can be very liberating, I use a £20 pair of SoundPEATS. they're not going to win any audiophile prizes but they're sufficient :) * pick something that isn't annoying and doesn't require any concentration * as you and others have said the lyrics chew up space in your language processing centres and that isn't conducive to coding * a regular 4/4 beat is very good for me, it's like having a little metronome * make sure you have something that'll force you to take a break from both coding and headphones every couple of hours, it's super important for your long term health * open back headphones are only cool if you're alone, if there's anyone else around you, closed-back or sealed-in-ear and keep the volume down. Noone wants to try to code next to the annoying teenager with tinny *tsss* *tsss* *tsss* bleeding through * no air guitar, or worse, air decks. you're not standing in front of 20K people in a stadium Think of the people around you, look after your ear health, let the music block out the world and code :)
I seem to be more productive in silence, but it’s easier to get started with music. Of course it’s NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL LO FI HIP HOP RADIO 24/7 CHILL GAMING / STUDY BEATS TO CHILL AND RELAX TO
SimpleNamespace is *amaaaziiiiiing*! Thank you for sharing that! I feel like I've met my standard library soulmate.
Yes, it just cancels out the noise around me and makes me either hyped or relaxed, depends on the kind of music. My all time favorites for relaxing are the OSTs of The Sims 1, Journey, Ori and the Blind Forest and everything from the band Air. To get me hyped some DnB such as Netsky, and to get me really aggressive with coding Limp Bizkit.
I usually don't listen to music while programming, but when I do, I put on some music without lyrics. It might be a game OST, or a Spotify playlist for studying, or just beats.
Hmm, I will try that. Thanks!
Seems nice. Will look into it. Thanks!
The single greatest thing that golang did was introduce `gofmt` and get the community behind it. I've worked with the bell-ends that will happily eat up a 3 hour meeting over bullcrap spacing arguments. PEP8 is awesome, and I totally get the point of not blindly following every rule (oh your line is 81 chars long? split it!) However, enforcing a tool and a configuration in any work context these days just makes sense. I honestly don't care that special snowflakes want to have things *just so*. Hand tuned and all. Screw them. It's wasted time, space and arguments. Learn to work in the format the team and project have accepted, use a tool to automatically enforce it, brook no arguments from that point on :)
I've found a couple of genre that suits me very well and I mix them depending on my mood - lofi hip hop and synthwave, they go very well with programming, because most of the tracks don't have lyrics, so nothing to distract you, just rhythm that drives you away from reality and loud colleagues :)
The sample code in the README looks nice. I haven't tried it out but may give it a go in the next small internal project I hack together.
I don't code, but do other work that requires concentration. The "Focus" and perhaps "Chill" groups in Spotify are your friend. As someone else mentioned, no lyrics. Words do something to the brain, divert focus I think. I've been listening to electronic downtempo stuff but as a change of pace, started listening to piano music and I like it very much. I think the piano music actually increases my ability to focus, but I can't prove that. 
I personally use SQLite \+ Dataset Module
Also Donkey Kong country, specially the 2!
I'm not sure I understand exactly what you're asking, but this might help. def fill_containers(source, containers, n): minimum_containers = math.ceil(len(source) / n)) if minimum_containers &gt; len(containers): raise ValueError("Not enough containers supplied") used_containers = containers[:minimum_containers] for item, container in zip(source, itertools.cycle(used_containers)): container.add(item) return containers It meets the following criteria: &gt; all containers shall be either full or, if not, shall have the same filling level That is, if not all containers can be full, container fullness is not as important as equal distribution. &gt; An exception may be thrown if all containers are full. The exception is thrown before filling, so that the caller can deal with it before they've lost any items. It doesn't handle the dynamic handing-off of items, because that's incompatible with keeping the same filling level - you need to know how many items you'll have if you want to evenly distribute them.
Hard question to answer. IMO, you should use whatever language works best for your task at hand. Maybe you need to define your task, first?
Right, forgot about that. I want to make games, and thats why i wanted to use c\+\+
Indeed. In the simple case, config is just a series of KV pairs. If it's more complicated you can have the columns ENV and JSON\_BLOB and then prod → {"admins": \["bob", "alice"\]}, dev → {"admins": "\*"} etc.
What do you prefer instead?
&gt; A raspberry pi 3 is actually a lot faster than my desktop from 2005 no it's not
Web search finds me this: https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3 for Rust and https://github.com/go-python/gopy for Go. These are both programming languages with optimizing compilers, that can run your program on multiple CPU cores at the same time, with extensive standard libraries, lots of data-structures built-in or available as third-party libraries: what you need to write speedy and reliable code in reasonable time.
A good scripting language is something that almost everybody should have in his toolkit, so the only reason to "move on" from Python is because for whatever reasons (usually related to whatever others around you at work or play are using) another similar language works better. For example, a job switch recently prompted me to start using Python, and Ruby (which I had been using since 2002 or so) has now dropped by the wayside. That's not because Python is a significantly better language (though I feel it's a bit better, overall) but because we do a good deal of our work in Python so there's really no point in introducing another similar language there. C++ is a very different language from Python and suitable for very different things. If you need to pull a pile of data out of text files and massage it, Python is generally a far better tool for this than C++ (especially if it's a one-time thing). So while you should go ahead and start learning C++ if you like, if you're doing any real programming work (rather than just playing) there will still be plenty of situations where you'll want to use Python instead. You may also find Python useful for sketching out algorithms while you're still working on the algorithm itself, rather than trying to get a fast implementation of something when you already know exactly how you want to do it. And don't forget that you can use the two together: Python has no problem calling C++ code and it's quite common to write performance-intensive code in C++ but call it from Python. (In fact, at work we do exactly this: C++ is our other main language.) TLDR: You'll never "move on": keep using Python where it works better and use other languages where they work better.
I mean, if you were gonna go the Unity3D route, that's done in either C# or Javascript, right? Is there a toolkit you plan to use?
ggplot in R. It’s a lot easier to manipulate the basic features and to also layer different stats. I don’t think it looks as good as matplotlib though (on the rare occasion it actually works for me).
While working I like stuff like Jon Hopkins or Tim Hecker.
Learn the language you want to use. If you want to learn C++ there's no point in learning Python.
I do.
I don't think that necessarily means it's spam, it's a great post that helped me understand the topic. It's not like they were just advertising their product. 
Well, I heard that you can use c++ with the unreal engine or something like that
Weird, my coworkers just see it as a signal that they need to wave their hand in front of my face to break my train of thought.... I'm not bitter about it
Embedded key\-value DBs are as ancient as the hills: [dbm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dbm) (1979) was one of the first ones on Unix, and in the eighties [Berkeley DB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_DB) was written as a free alternative. During the 90s Berkeley DB saw some heavy development that made it one of the most solid single\-process persistent key\-value stores available and able to support huge data sets. The Python bindings for this library are in a package called [bsddb3](https://pypi.org/project/bsddb3/"&gt;bsddb3), available from PyPI.
**Dbm** The dbm library was a simple database engine, originally written by Ken Thompson and released by AT&amp;T in 1979. The name is a three letter acronym for DataBase Manager, and can also refer to the family of database engines with APIs and features derived from the original dbm. The dbm library stores arbitrary data by use of a single key (a primary key) in fixed-size buckets and uses hashing techniques to enable fast retrieval of the data by key. The hashing scheme used is a form of extendible hashing, so that the hashing scheme expands as new buckets are added to the database, meaning that, when nearly empty, the database starts with one bucket, which is then split when it becomes full. *** **Berkeley DB** Berkeley DB (BDB) is a software library intended to provide a high-performance embedded database for key/value data. Berkeley DB is written in C with API bindings for C++, C#, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Smalltalk, Tcl, and many other programming languages. BDB stores arbitrary key/data pairs as byte arrays, and supports multiple data items for a single key. Berkeley DB is not a relational database. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
In a way yeah, but it's better to be mumbling along or tapping than being dragged off the task at hand to help do stuff that doesn't need doing right away or even isn't important. Also prevents me from getting involved in the office conversations. 
Why not just run it in the cloud?
I do get the occasional paper ball or Skype IM or whatever, but the majority of the time I get away with doing my work. 
For more modern ambient stuff, try Explosions in the Sky and This Will Destroy You. Some of The Album Leaf, Hammock, God is an Astronaut stuff is good too. I just have a Pandora station of all of this shit and it does a really good job. Didn't have much luck with spotify stations, personally.
Used to use 8tracks - search with *instrumental* keyword + *study* or *programming* Recently gone on youtube and listened to Lo-fi lmao 
My dad has a similar approach but with the Prometheus sound track, he says it's intense and atmospheric and gives him a sense of urgency which helps increase his productivity. 
Nope. Perhaps it's because I used to be a recording engineer, but when I listen to music it's far to easy to get distracted analyzing it.
I assume you used a framework like Django or Flask?
Oh yeah I do everything to music. Most Dev Houses Iv worked at have been totally cool with it as long as you are using headphones Some even provide you with decent ones. I usually listen to a lot of punk rock but also some more alternative stuff such as alt-j. Lyrics don't really bother me.
People are posting my articles this week! That's always fun. Let me know if you have any questions. Also this particular article is from my soon\-to\-be\-released book, [ReportLab: PDF Processing in Python](https://leanpub.com/reportlab/)
You will probably like the "Nex machina" sound track too. 
Zodb? Sqlite with json. Vedis. Unqlite. 
I listen to music while coding but it can't be something with lyrics. I end up focusing too much on the lyrics so I can't form any sentences or code in my head. Usually either Jazz or classical, and I'm not very picky. I'd recommend less 'upbeat' stuff if you're getting started but I also enjoy the happy stuff like Take Five (Dave Brubeck), In the Mood (Glen Miller) or maybe some Sing Sing Sing (Benny Goodman). Anything goes, it just depends on the day I guess :)
last few command i have written the terminal command not any english new version :) . 
Will check it out, thank you!
ChilledCow lofi hip hop radio - beats to relax/study to. No lyrics, calming without putting me to sleep. Blocks noise from the outside world so I can concentrate
Thanks, I'll take a look!
&gt; ...since my teacher refuses to help me... That's a very, very bad sign. Either you are approaching learning in some terribly wrong way (and one not obvious from your post) or your teacher isn't doing a very good job. The general kind of problem you're encountering is a very common one amongst new students of programming (actually, even amongst many moderately experienced coders, sadly) and is often not well addressed by programming curricula. If you can spare the time and feel you really want to learn how to attack writing real programs, I'd suggest you start working through [How to Design Programs](http://htdp.org/2018-01-06/Book/). That stands a good chance of teaching you what your current teacher and curriculum seemingly can't. Two objections to this will probably quickly arise. 1. The book uses Scheme. Have no fear on this front, the techniques you learn will translate to Python (some almost directly, some in a slightly less direct way) and seeing how a different language does things will in fact make learning easier in the long run. It will help you see what the real concepts are, as opposed to just getting bogged down in thinking about syntax, and often when you have trouble expressing something in one language you'll find it much easier get grasp on the problem in another language and then translate across. 2. At the start you're going to have to put a good bit of extra time and effort into doing both your current course and HTDP. There's really no way around that in the short term, but in the long run it will make things a lot easier. It's an investment and, as with any investment, the more you can put in up front the bigger the return will be over any given amount of time. That said, if you're pressed for time at least do a little bit of HTDP every week and eventually it will accumulate and help you out. A lot.
For me, Grateful Dead, Phish, jam-bands 
I listen to lo-fi hiphop, somehow it enhances te capability to focus.
Yes. Almost always without lyrics. Techno music is awesome when you are coding (this encompasses modern EDM and some of the older genres). Also, I have been listening to a lot of Jake Chudnow (If you are familiar with Vsauce videos, every single background piece is by this guy). I use it to get in the mood. Plus, when you are listening to something by Remi Gallego, coding becomes so much more fun. 
This is really cool! Do you have a GitHub repo I could follow for this? Quick question, can you point me in the right direction to make sure my websites are GDPR compliant? I understand I have to rework my privacy policies and let the user control what 3rd parties can access their info.
No encryption. Sry, but QPDF is better.
The [shelve](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shelve.html) module is in the standard library. As per /u/cjs's advice, it uses dbm. Using [SQLite](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) is also reasonable as /u/earthboundkid suggested. SQLite is the [most popular choice](https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html) for this, across all programming languages. They estimate that there are over 1 trillion SQLite databases in use. However, since it's key-value pairs, you might as well use the dict-like interface that `shelve` provides.

Finally a person who doesn't! :P
\&gt; All the time you do this you are not writing the actual code. yeah, it totally makes sense if you apply it to other people's code. And of course I wouldn't fix other people's code for them. I usually use a linter plug\-in for my GitHub projects so that contributors have to do the fixing if they don't adhere to the style.
Saved the post to read later. Thanks for the comment. Unsaved. 
This with the exception of extremely familiar music. If I've heard it 1000 times I can generally code while listening to it.
Are you sure you need a db? Maybe you are overthinking it and you just need to serialize your data to a file. 
kraftwerk works for me

Beware though that pickle is very unsafe, so don’t use this if you expect users to pass around files to each other. 
Well, that is a real pickle indeed. [PICKLES](/r/picklelove/) 
I always listen to music. I find that when I hit really annoying bugs that make me want to pull my hair out when not listening to music, if I hit those bugs while listening to music I'm much more calm in tackling them and don't go crazy. I will do lyrics and non lyrics. I like epic trailer music. For example: Audiomachine Ivan Torrent Mark Petrie Two Steps from Hell James Everingham 
pyautogui as a bare minimum to be able to take pictures of and interact with the game
From your last comment: &gt;hello sir, you have to give environment path after installing python if you are using windows os. This makes no sense.
It really depends on what I am in the mood for, but a while back i found this collection of [Music for programming](https://musicforprogramming.net) that I have found to be really good.
That you used a line graph when the x axis consists of just a list of alphabetically ordered words makes me cry a single tear. 
I'd argue that the continuous line here doesn't represent anything, it's effectively a random zigzag. You could sort your data first which would make the line actually informative, clearly showing the distribution, or produce a histogram to see if it resembles the gauss curve.
I like to listen to Vaporwave whenever I'm coding. It's atmospheric and any vocals are simple and incidental. Plus it's got that nostalgic-futuristic feel that just works with telling a computer what to do.
Ah didn’t look at post history. Usually the spam posts are just lame ass spam blogs that are obvious
Can't believe this is the only comment that mentions Lofi. I've completely fallen in love with this stuff. There is ChillHop and ChilledCow which are the biggest. ChillHop: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsBrT6vbQa8 ChilledCow: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw3UYy02lSI Both are pretty much the same thing. I've listened to hundreds of hours of this stuff and my coding has become 10x more pleasant with Lofi in my life. 
Gessafelstein and the ilk are godlike for coding sessions. Gets you in the groove
In the same vein of African Rock I really like Tinariwen, Ali Farka Toure, and Bombino.
YouTube has a fantastic station called Just Good Music 24/7; feeling super productive with it in the background
&gt; you can use threading if your program is network bound &gt; doesn't even mentions `asyncio` lol, ok
Thanks I will check them out 
I can't do lyrics, because it messes with parts of my brain that want to focus on the task at hand. Spotify has a curated selection of a bunch of playlists called "Deep Focus" that I use when I want background noise but not stuff I want to sing along to.
A lot of women are turned off by my Lisp.
&gt; 'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command yes, it makes sense if you don't have a valid path in your environment.Your given problem solution that i have provided like "python' is not recognized as an internal or external command"
Is the file your code is in named `dash.py`?
Disclaimer: total Python noob Would pdfrw be suitable for parsing highly unstructured PDFs? At my work, we convert engineering drawings made in CAD programs into PDFs for use on the manufacturing floor. It's an extremely tedious process to make sure parts called out across multiple pages of PDF match the Bill of Material total part counts on the first page. I'm wondering if it would be feasible to use Python to automate this process. The problem is the text (part number and a quantity) I'd be looking for could essentially be anywhere on the page. Is something like this feasible?
If you used ReportLab with pdfrw you could add encryption, I think...
You might be able to use pdfrw for this, but I think PDFMiner would likely be better \- [https://github.com/euske/pdfminer](https://github.com/euske/pdfminer)
gg, thanks
\&gt; very unsafe That's an overstatement. Pickle is no less safe than \`pip install\`.
Lo-fi,it is LOVE! 
If users are exchanging files, opening a file someone sends you (potentially even a person you trust) and having it erase your files or encrypting them or exfiltrating them are all really bad scenarios. Remember Word macro viruses? Yes, pip could do those things, but a) the PyPI would pull down a malicious package if it was found and B) I don't pip install things that someone sends me randomly, I only pip install things I seek out.
There are codes that do this already: [sqlitedict](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/sqlitedict)

White Noise/Brown Noise playlists on Spotify. There’s one track called cabin sounds that replicates the sound of being on an airplane minus screaming kids. Blocks out noise, no lyrics. 
When im bored of programming it usually helps to put on some retrowave or any other \*wave it seems...
I need noise, doesn't matter if it's music or just ambient noise. When I'm in the mood for music, I usually will choose something from [Soma.FM](https://Soma.FM), I like their stations Groove Salad, Dub Step Beyond, and cliq hop. If I'm distracted by music, ANoise is a good ambient noise generator. I like the Coffee House indistinct chatter and forest/stream noises.
Call me cliche: DEFCON Radio on SomaFM
Firstly, make sure you're allowed to put work data on github \- at some places this can be a big no\-no and violates tons of security policy. Secondly, you shouldn't really be storing data on github anyway, which is really intended for code, and not generally larger data files. For data I would suggest using something like AWS S3. It's super cheap to store data on there, and pandas can read files directly from S3 using the pd.read\_csv function just like you would with a file on your local filesystem with pd.read\_csv("s3://bucket/directory/file.csv")
Yes. One of the features is exporting the data to CSV and importing from CSV to database.
I think you'd have to setup a proxy: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/60618/how-to-monitor-my-home-network-traffic?utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_source=google_rich_qa&amp;utm_campaign=google_rich_qa Then use the proxy to trigger your API calls to Hue's API.
Agree, I've made good use of PDFMiner. I have only ever paid attention to the textual content however; layout and graphics have never been important for my use cases.
That's the exact command I'd use - the contents of `example.txt` should be whatever you'd type into the shell. Eg: cd foo/bar ls -la python baz.py exit
good list! Are you interested on a small to medium data , pure python based streaming framework? Have you checked [motorway](https://github.com/plecto/motorway)
I would suggest Kafka. I don’t think there’s a lot of support for Kafka Stream for Python as you said. 
I just tried this. It *technically* works for me, but the problem is that asciinema uses timestamp data to determine the "flow" of the recording. Piping from a file results in the timestamps all being very close together (within like a tenth of a second), so the recording just flies through the commands faster than you can see. My first thought would be to just edit the timestamps in the resulting `test.cast` file but this doesn't look like a trivial task. For example, consider this [test.cast](http://ix.io/1cvx) created using this [example.txt](http://ix.io/1cvA/txt). Any suggestions?
How about Parquet files
I think it's generally good article, but use iter function instead of accessing __iter__ directly. You rarely have to access dunder methods directly. Also, using iter will allow for more collections to work. https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#iter
Yes, but the situation you're worrying about is someone overwriting the "cache.db" file or whatever the application is calling it's storage. That's about as weird as someone asking you to replace "application.py" with a different file. If you're overwriting specific files for some malicious person, that person probably could have asked you to execute a file attachment. Security is important, but let's not go overboard and ignore very useful tools. I still take user data and put it into SQL queries, despite [Little Bobby Tables](https://xkcd.com/327/).
I understand that. This is why I keep saying “exchanging files”. If it’s purely an internal DB go nuts. 
Gotcha. I assumed from the original question, "I'm writing a desktop app and would like to store data locally" that the database would be tucked away in the application files.
If this were a green field project, I'd probably look at running a postgres database with python-multicorn foreign data wrapper (https://multicorn.org/foreign-data-wrappers/) and then do a mysql FDW to support legacy applications.
A couple of points, in no particular order: - You can run pure python tasks (bolts) on Apache Storm using Streamparse. - Twitter’s Heron is said to be an evolution of Storm with better performance and better documentation. It can run code written for Storm without any changes. I’m not clear though whether python code written with streamparse can be dropped straight onto Heron. - Depending on the quantity of data you’re streaming, you could use Celery and SQS/RabbitMQ/Redis. You might also consider running python functions on AWS Lambda, but again, whether this is suitable depends on what type work you’re looking to do. 
Working on a python programme for realtime analytics using Flink and Kafka.
Without more specifics, I'd say you're probably looking for [getpass](https://docs.python.org/3/library/getpass.html).
Do you need to store the data? AWS/GPS needs additional storage configuration. Do you have a lot of data? For smaller stuff, I find AWS SQS incredibly easy to work with. Your use case might be different. SQS removes a lot of client application logic for you so you just focus on process the message. There are a lot of limitations, but I find for smaller use cases, it works very well.
I would like to take in input securely, and then pass the md5 hash of that through the API call.
Mmm I understand you, I was just learning more about matplotlib and didn't think too much in the type of chart that I should use😅
Yeah, I should have used a histogram. I was following a tutorial series about matplotlib and didn't think too much about that
You can use Python's [debugger](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html), using its [commands](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#debugger-commands) to navigate your way through the procedure.
This module focusses purely on providing a simple interface to low level audio devices. I suppose in your case, maybe you will be more concerned with audio processing libraries?
Right, but how? The command line? A web form? Qt app? And what does "securely" mean? Are you trying to guarantee your users keystrokes aren't being logged? Do you just need to prevent the password from being echo'd as they type?
Well, I would like to avoid learning new thing on top of a new thing, especially that this debugger looks very complex to use. I spent some time on Visual Studio and hope to find solution for this problem. I don't even know if this debugger which You linked will let me inspect code which is embedded, not directly in the module which I run.
I was only bringing to your attention an alternative. It's up to you whether you learn the tool and use it as a solution to your problem. And yes, it doesn't discriminate against library/third-party/etc. source code. If code is to be executed, you can step into it using the debugger.
Yeah, it was a project for one of my courses too! You’re right, it’s really fun to make, even though it works pretty badly and crashes a lot. I’m going to keep the code and try to improve on it as I learn more. My biggest problem is with preprocessing. I’m using BeautifulSoup to scrape html, which seems to be great if you know exactly what you’re looking for, but with lots of different styles on different news sites, I end up with a lot of junk like side-text and datelines.
I wish somebody could integrate tools like this right into the Zotero
I know it's not something to ask on Reddit, but if you plan to downvote, may I ask you to put a little word to explain why? I don't mind the downvotes, or any negative opinion about this project, since feedback is exactly what I'm looking for. But it's very frustrating to ask for feedback and to get none, while still being downvoted.
Hope it will serve you well. Feel free to open an issue or to PM me directly if you need any help. :) 
If you dont need VMs for your project.. it maybe too much overhead.. as it can get tricky just managing VMs. Python Virtualenvs are great as isolating the dependencies of projects.. but if the operation of your code depends on OS system level variables.. then it becomes super useful for creating a repeatable test environment.. 
Pikepdf lets you use QPDF from Python.
Hey, you should look up a bit more about actual "GIT" and how it works. Ideally you'd have a "repository" on your laptop, like a folder and you push that to github with updates of your code. Then it's accessible from your normal machine in "local" but then also when you "push" the changes you made in your code in your code editor (atom/brackets) etc you can save it online. Often they can be 1:1 and it's easy way to save code. Kraken is a good overlook for how git actually works. 
Motorway seems interesting ! I'm a bit afraid that I doesn't seems very active though. Are you using it?
Continuing my work from here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/8mzdqf/whats_everyone_working_on_this_week/dzwwmlv/ There some weirdness going on with one of my VMs.. whereby I can't connect to another similar VM repeatably. Can't even get the problem to happen repeatably. If I can't figure it out by tomorrow, I will just let it go and comeback to it later. This week I will have to come up with some milestones and mockups for the project I am working on. And figure out a simple prototype for Jenkins.
Thanks! I didn't knew that. You mean, using Celery for batch processing and SQS/RMQ/Redis for stream processing ?
Not a lot. 100k items per day ? I'll take a look.
Check if your spec is under the limits here. [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs\-limits.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-limits.html)
You've used the same variable names twice. When you do `send_keys(username)`, the `username` variable no longer contains the string that you're trying to send, because you put the return value of `find_element_by_id` in the same variable.
Nothing great sorry. The file looks like JSON on each line, so programmatic editing may be feasible if you don't treat it as plain text? 
Username is an WebElement by your selection. Create a new variable trueusername = john, and use .send_keys (trueusername)
I admit this was clearly a bad question... but I found so many posts about it, which did not offer any solution and suggested it is a bug in selenium ... xD
thanks, my bad
&gt;People seems to treat style mistakes very seriously, more than any other language which people? If you're writing Python for an employer, the opinion that counts is that of whomever is tasked with OKing the commit. I've been at places where a pep8 warning was considered a blocker, and I've been at places with no style rules at all. If you show your code to random people on the internet, they'll be full of opinions, but who cares? An upside of this style neurosis is that the tools are pretty good. In general I don't even care about Python style, my editor handles the bulk of it, and one of the myriad tools will straighten out anything I miss. In the end I only care about formatting the code in such a way that the other developers who have gone to great lengths to configure their tools and editors to conform to a common notion of style aren't inconvenienced by my deviation from our agreed conventions.
Ha, just pulling your leg (sólo una broma). It *is* a fun feature of matplotlib!
My only problem with the package is the almost total lack of documentation
I think your thinking is spot on. "Not pythonic" is not a good criticism of code. "Pythonic" is about style and readability, and style/readability critiques need to be specific. Rule of thumb, if a comment sounds pretentious or unhelpful if you replace "pythonic" with "*je ne sais quoi*," that comment most likely is pretentious and unhelpful to begin with. I think Ken Reitz's [comments on python style](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/style/) in "The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python" are pretty spot on.
Here is the proper code: print('Reading rows...') for row in range(2, sheet.max_row + 1): state = sheet['B' + str(row)].value county= sheet['C' + str(row)].value pop = sheet['D' + str(row)].value countyData.setdefault(state, {}) countyData[state].setdefault(county, {'tracts':0, 'pop':0}) countyData[state][county]['tracts'] += 1 countyData[state][county]['pop'] += int(pop) print('Writing results...') resultFile = open('census2010.py', 'w') resultFile.write('allData = ' + pprint.pformat(countyData)) resultFile.close() print('Done.')
I'm not sure where you're getting your information from, but style is heavily emphasized in every language. python was just one of the first with a mostly universally adopted style guide for quite some time. newer languages even come with formatters the "one way to do things" mantra is not a mandate, but more a description of emergent behavior. code often looks similar in python because there is often a clear way to do things, but no one is stopping you from using convoluted strategies just to clarify, "pythonic" is python's word for "idiomatic." idiomatic code is simply that the community feels is the best way to accomplish a certain task, whether that be style, naming conventions, syntax, etc. each language has its own idioms. learning idioms of one language will only negatively affect you if you refuse to adopt the idioms of another one. just like with spoken languages, the more languages you pick up, the easier it will be to become fluent (idiomatic) in or shift between new languages and you briefly touched on it, but more important than idioms are paradigms. people often claim to be "language agnostic" but that often means they have just learned the syntax which is a trivial task after a certain level of experience. being able to transition between paradigms seamlessly is the real trick
I have made such a program! https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B9JlBNYTHOVfQlhHLXBvRC01QWs It took me over a year. GUI in PyQt, I use PostGIS (Geo db) and Neo4J (graph DB), OpenCV and a forked private version of Pdfminer. I'm located in Norway. Let's talk if you are interested in cooperation!

What do you mean by "NoSQL"? That's not a technology or even a type of database. Do you want a document database? A column-oriented database? A key-value store? Something else?
\&gt; I tried to implement project Euler fibonacci problems recursively, with iterations, as higher order functions on list comprehensions, mutate on purpose. Thinking about different cons and pluses of solutions. In personal work, no one cares what your code looks like. In professional work, you are not writing code for you, you are writing code for the person in 6 months that has add a feature or fix a bug to your code. If you are doing mutating functions in list comprehensions, no one but you will understand how that works, and you'll be lucky if you understand how it works in 6 months of not touching it. This is why languages form idioms. So other developers can quickly recognize what code is doing without having to trace logic that mutates in real time. This has nothing to do with python. Rust, C, Ruby, Perl, Js, any language at all \- if you are writing hard to follow code you will not pass code review.

I would try using pandoc to convert it to markdown, then paste that markdown into the jupyter notebook. I'm not sure how pandoc handles images, though.
I'm stuck. I want to find a way to display pages of a pdf full screen but I can't find anything. For now I convert to jpg and use pygame to display them. Does anyone know of packages I could look into?
Here's the markdown code for embedding an image in your post: `![mouseover-text](img/picture.png)`
Arduinos run python. Raspberry pis run python. Worry more about the controller than the language for starters. 
This is controlled by the PDF viewer. There is a setting in Adobe Reader that you can set to always open PDFs in full screen, I think

That's 26.
I hope not, it brings too much guarantees which makes programming python simple. If you want a python w/o this, try other falvours. ironpython or jython have no gil. However, they're mostly not faster (especially not due to this fact). If you need performance, use async, threads or even multiprocessing. It's all much easier than having no gil. Or try your program with pypy which has a jit and optimizes algorithms often very well.
sounds like maybe you could sell this as a product.
Honestly, those who will scold your for writing "unpythonic" code are a loud, moronic minority. In reality, what people call "pythonic" is usually one of the following: - Patterns and approaches that have emerged and turned out to work rather well, often avoiding non-obvious pitfalls. - The general notion of avoiding overengineering and unnecessary complexity and clutter. A.k.a. "Keep It Simple, Stupid". - Working with the language instead of fighting it. The best paradigm in the world is useless if the language you're stuck with isn't equipped to handle it elegantly. This goes for all languages, and Python has a few peculiar design choices to it that lead to rather typical strengths and weaknesses. Play the strengths, mitigate the weaknesses, and know both. - Tradition. While often arbitrary choices, traditions and customs still make it easier for people familiar with them to communicate. And that's an important function of a programming language. That said, the fact that the Python community has coined a special term, "pythonic", for what other cultures just call "idiomatic", is telling. Make of that what you will.

Raspberry pi can obviously run whatever you want to on it, but isn't Arduino pretty C/C++ specific? Unless you just mean using python to generate inputs, but you'll still need to write some C for the Arduino to do anything with them. Apart from that I agree, the language used for control isn't nearly important as actually building the robot.
You can actually run powershell as a subprocess in python. I'm working on an application that interfaces with Outlook at the moment using it. 
https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/what-is-circuitpython I just learned about it a couple of weeks ago.

Thanks for the reply. I recognise your username and I know we've chatted python before. We retrieve PDF reports and then on a large TV we display them for employees to reference. What we do now is someone constantly checks the site then downloads and displays new PDFs. I was smart (or so I thought) and said I could automate it with Python. I've been googling for days and nothing. Is there a display package or do I need to use an external program like Reader?
We don't need to remove the GIL, there are already multiple solutions which make it a non-issue already. - You can use Cython to supress the GIL for fast computations. - You can use `multiprocessing` in the stdlib to bypass the GIL for sharding work. You can also use the `concurrent` module for ProcessPoolExecutor. - You can use asyncio to make the GIL irrelevant for IO-bound workloads. - You can use PyPy to speed up long running Python programs at the cost of RAM consumption. 
See the GILectomy project
That sounds pretty useful. Do you recommend any resources to get started with using PS within python?
Wherever you work will have guidelines for how you should write code. If they don't it's a red flag about that place. It's a benefit of python that a lot of the questions of style and method are universal instead of every company coming up with their own. (Not that companies don't ignore python standard practices) 
Do something, put it on github and wait for people to become impressed. Otherwise your post will be ignored
What you need is a way to render the PDF onscreen. One way would be to create a quick and dirty UI in Python. I looked up how you might do this with PyQt for example: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18024962/is-it-possible-to-preview-pdfs-in-a-pyqt-application You could also launch a PDF using Python's `webbrowser` module or `os.startfile` One other idea I just had would be to just convert the PDF pages to an image like a PNG. That's a lot easier to display in Python than a PDF. This StackOverflow answer talks about using the Wand project for that purpose: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27826854/python-wand-convert-pdf-to-png-disable-transparent-alpha-channel
C++ is more traditionally used to build game engines (or to build a game from scratch). Unreal can also be programmed in C# btw, so that's a safe bet if you want to use game engines.
Unless you are making C-extensions.
I just found [PyMuPDF] (https://github.com/rk700/PyMuPDF) . Looks like they're doing what you just suggested. It makes sense and this looks better than the mess I was making with converting to JPG and using pygame.
Came here
Alright then, Thank you
Yup, I used Flask. I heard it was better to use than Flask for a first python website and I liked that it kept things simple
This isn't stack overflow, and regardless, more information would be necessary to assist. Which instructions did you follow, for one? Where have you looked for files and how have you tried to launch them?
I have heard of that, but I haven't tried it out. Let me know what you think if you get it working though as it's something I was thinking about writing about for my blog.
Have you plotted these on a graph?
Oh lol, I forgot the GitHub link lol
The easiest way to explain the difference is just to look at a table: N | log(N) | N*log(N) ---|---|---- 1 | 0.00 | 0.00 2 | 0.30 | 0.60 3 | 0.48 | 1.43 4 | 0.60 | 2.41 5 | 0.70 | 3.49 6 | 0.78 | 4.67 7 | 0.85 | 5.92 8 | 0.90 | 7.22 9 | 0.95 | 8.59 10 | 1.00 | 10.00 When plotted it [looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/nBIZRR2.png). `log(N)` grows very slowly, whereas `N*log(N)` grows fast, faster than `O(N)`.
If you're intent on running Python use a Raspberry Pi. They are better for things like this anyway. I've had the idea of using Python to control a robot, but haven't gotten around to it yet. Most of my experience with using micro controllers was with an arduino, but it's language isn't that much different tbh.
I haven't learned anything about using github but it sounds like I'm about at your skill level. I've been programming with python for a little while.

There are some good higher-level tools in Python for simplifying this sort of thing. Seaborn is probably the most important, and since it is built on top of matplotlib it still allows the low-level customization if you really need it. There is also a python port of ggplot, also built on top of matplotlib. There is not much reason to use matplotlib directly unless you need something very simple or some extremely complicated.
&gt; I was interested in Kafka/Kafka Stream, but the Python support for Kafka Stream seems weak. Their latest development in ksql will likely alleviate most of your concerns here. But you mentioned Batch, and while Kafka can do Batch, Spark may be better suited.
All logarithms are equivalent, and I find it a bit more intuitive to understand it in base 10: A linear O(n) essentially means that when your input size is multiplied by 1000, your computation time is multiplied by 1000, no funny business here. For a logarithmic O(log n), if your input size is multiplied by a 1000, your computation time is multiplied by 3. That's quite a massive difference... If your algorithm processes 1 input in 1ms, if it is linear, it will process a million inputs in 1000s, or around 20mn. If it is logarithmic, it will process this million more in 6ms... Now, O(n log n) is technically superlinear, but log increases so incredibly slowly (asymptotically, slower than any polynomial, no matter how small!) that you wouldn't be entirely wrong in thinking of it as quasi linear. If your input increases 1000fold, you will have a 3000 increase in computation time. 1000000fold would be 6000000, and in general 10^n would see a n*10^n increase. Asymptotic complexity might not be the full picture; in particular, lower complexity often come with enormous costs which might take massive scales to 'pay off', but in general, O(log n) is essentially the poor man's O(1), and O(n log n) is in most cases pretty indistinguishable from O(n). 
You might think of O(log n) as having to complete a constant time task log n times. O(n log n), however, would be completing a task log n times, but the task takes n time to complete (i.e it depends on the input size).
Amazing if it works. Thanks!
Check out peewee's [playhouse](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#kv): from playhouse.kv import KeyValue This can use sqlite (optionally with apsw driver) or a couple of others for the backend. If you don't want those, you can check out the same author's other projects which work similarly, including walrus, which targets redis and redis-like databases (rlite being an embedded choice here).
Thank you all for your thoughtful replies! It totally clicked for me now. Seeing it plotted on a graph as well as thinking about the size of the input in regards to how many times the task must be performed was really helpful. 
well.. c++ compared to python. not too similiar. but python does have tons of libraries that let you write in python, but execute c++ code sometimes
Wanna work together? I can teach you about github in the process, its actually very simple
I had to request permission on drive to look at it but it sounds promising!
Yea I would second seaborn. Basically ggplot for Python 
I’m with you on Seaborn. Complex visualizations are actually possible and the plots are easier to read too. Not sure why I hadn’t heard of ggplot for python, even though it’s my preferred datavis method 😂 thanks for pointing that out!
I like to use a binary tree as example like [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#/media/File:Binary_tree.svg) to understand your example. To find a element in such tree, you need only need to look at log2(n) elements (tree height). To look at all elements in such tree, it will take N * log2(N) to do such task.

Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. While I was at it, I checked [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) but I couldn't find a useful result Though fair warning, this section of the my code is under development, and I don't expect these links to be very useful. *** ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative)

Hey man, your text based RPG project sounds pretty fun. Do you have any games that gave you direct inspiration so I could take a look? 
log n is a lot faster. you can prove it to yourself in an ipython shell: generate yourself 10 million random numbers and shuffle them In [35]: stuff = [x for x in range(10000000)] In [36]: random.shuffle(stuff) In [37]: stuff[0:4] Out[37]: [9944046, 188592, 9978815, 6927827] Now see how long to sort them O(n log n) In [38]: %timeit sorted_stuff = sorted(stuff) 6.76 s ± 129 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) And how long to find a number in the list by naive iteration O(n) In [43]: def linear_search(a,x): ...: for idx,val in enumerate(a): ...: if val == x: ...: return idx In [48]: %timeit linear_search(stuff, random.randint(0,10000000)) The slowest run took 10.17 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached. 646 ms ± 443 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) And how long it takes via binary search O(log n) [https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Binary\_search#Python:\_Recursive](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Binary_search#Python:_Recursive) In [50]: %timeit binary_search(sorted_stuff, random.randint(0,10000000)) 1.87 µs ± 12.2 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)
well, the project started with me teaching a friend python, but it was really just random ideas that we both had
For a text RPG, did you consider an engine like [Twine](http://twinery.org/)? If you're trying to implement a text MMO (a mud), don't. But if you do, and are using Python and don't know C, look at Evennia(https://github.com/evennia/evennia).
Well, I really didn't care about making a finished, polished project, I really wanted to do it to practice and learn about python and making mechanics like that, kind of 2 in 1 type deal
FYI, peewee includes a dataset [clone](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#dataset).
I was after an example of what you're trying to achieve :). Is it completely command line based with text input only? Just had a skim through the code, looks good fun, "a fucking nacho?!" Haha. Currently have a web project on ATM, but would like to contribute to this. 
Finished a CLI program to enter amazon giveaways. 
Why are you deciding on a technology without defining the problem? What kind of data and how much from where to where with how much processing at which steps using what security model and in what topology? That's just my first question off the top of my head.
You could start by having a look at **youtube-dl**, a command line tool in Python.

Cleaning up the code on my programming that runs on the Pi. It emails me my IP address and then keeps scanning it. When it changes, I get an email that gives me my new IP address. It allows me to then update my VPN, Camera, Putty and so on. My IP change every few weeks or so so it's super useful for me. Plus it's running on my Pi so it uses little to no electric and I forget about it until I get an email that my IP address has changed. 
There seems to be a misunderstanding here, your English is quite hard to understand. You must add your python executable location to the system path environment variable before you can use `python` command from the command line. Are you comfortable doing this yourself or do you want me to give you instructions? Once you have the `python` command working then you can pass your script to it to execute the script.
Yeah, that was us just screwing arround lol
Apache spark also has streaming support with a python API.
I agree that matplotlib is inexplicably tricky to use.

We run our own pypi server using [nexus repository server](https://www.sonatype.com/nexus-repository-sonatype). Nexus also has support for a docker registry (we also have shared container images). Everything is automated through CI. When you make a PR the tests/linters automatically run. Once code is merged to master you can run the CI build and it will build a new version of the package and ship it to nexus.

Hah, yes, it doesn't seem to be very well known, but it is quite useful. I first discovered it while playing around with argparse, which returns command line args in a namespace object. 
These are exactly what I was looking for! Thanks!
Have you considered reinstalling python?
* OS: Kubuntu * IDE/Editor: Neovim \+ tmux * Languages: Python3, Python2, cython, javascript &amp; html as necessary * Favorite libs &amp; frameworks: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit\-learn, flask, sqlalchemy, django, pyqt * Other: virtualenvwrapper, docker, postgres, nginx, git
I tried to but it was the MacOS default and path changing within terminal doesn't seem to be working 
Also already reinstalled OSX and it didn't fix it 
I am very interested as well, and requested access. Working on a similar problem at the moment.
Then you did not reinstall macOS.

The ggplot API is available in Python via the [plotnine](https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine) library. Also, [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) is a nice alternative IMO for declarative and interactive visualization.
I did - I waited an hour for it to finish.
Honestly, anybody who critiques your code for being "not pythonic" and then doesn't offer any specific examples to justify their criticism is just being pretentious. And all employers will have some sort of set of rules for coding conventions, and those rules often differ between companies, regardless of what language they're using. Python only stands out here because they came up with their own term for it instead of just calling it "idiomatic" like every other language, and because they have an official style guide. But while those conventions are useful, they are by no means universal. Google, for example, has their own Python style guide that differs from the official one. Other companies probably have their own style and conventions. Indentation is 2 spaces or 4 or 8 or whatever. 2 lines or 1 line between functions. Docstring and comment formatting. Etc. The "official" way is more of a "here's how to do it if you don't have a sensible way to do it already." Every language has its purists and Python purists just have more ammo because it has an official style recommendation. But in the end, if it's readable, performant, and not overengineered, then it's pretty much "pythonic" already.

That makes no sense. Reinstalling the OS will reinstall all system resources, which Python is.
You're on BSD so you need to pkg install python and PKG install python lang/&lt;version&gt; IIRC. Or try: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/
They're right though, if you did any kind of fresh install and it did not alleviate the issue, you did not complete said task successfully.
I did not know about f-strings. Nice.
I could actually if someone wanted it, I have the right license already for the data
i had the same problem, post-osx reinstall the files for python were still corrupted or something 
What do you mean "destroy"? Delete your program file? Change the look and feel? Without details this will get dismissed as a case of user error.

It's a bit weird to put in basics like list comprehensions and lambda expressions next to specific (albeit probably basic) features of numpy/pandas together. I mean, if you're going to cover list comprehensions here, at least mention how to implement nested loops!

Sure, if there is any part of the code you'd like done let me know I'm always looking for new projects.
I've been programming with python for about 2 years and arduino for much longer. On the basic level some of the biggest differences are the use of semicolons and brackets. The languages seem almost identical to me. Obviously with an Arduino your processing decisions differently due to the different uses of a micro controller.
I'm assuming you're referencing Rust. I agree its one of the key languages for the future, but for now I think C++ would be better.
I think if you just download the equivalent Python from python.org, you’ll be fine. The path in your post is where the macOS Python installer goes. The system Python framework files are in /System/Library/, not /Library/. 
I like to use Visual Studio Code as it allows easy debugging, plus it is light weight and good for looking and editing other types of files too.
Any recommendation a good podcast with Python ? 
Did you type that in with hand or did you generate it with a code?
Not in my opinion, but if the standard library could be modified to allow for practical sub-interpreters, that would be worthy of a major version bump, IMHO. 
Can you post a [minimal example](http://sscce.org/)? I'm not going to boot into windows just so I can import winsound, and I don't want to read through ~500 LoC to guess at where problem is. Also, /r/learnpython would be a better place for this.
This is a piracy software, so yeah it is no legal in most places.

&gt; I can process item in real time, in a pipeline, with mostly Python function. I don't think real time means what you think it means. Usually, when "real time" comes up in programming context, this is what it means: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing . Normally, any Python interpreter wouldn't be considered as a candidate for real-time systems because no language with garbage collection, memory allocation during program execution etc. wouldn't normally be considered for this task. From the libraries you mention I only worked with Kafka and a bit of RabbitMQ. So, I cannot tell much about other options you listed here. Kafka creates too much headache and confusion for Q/A, DevOps and automation teams. It's a quagmire of configuration options, where one slight misconfiguration may end up having a tremendous performance impact. On the Python side of things, the clients are quite slow (as compared to Java equivalents), but speed isn't the only problem. The API (regardless of the language) doesn't make a lot of sense: asking trivial questions about the state of your data usually gets you nowhere. For example, you cannot tell for sure what is the earliest message available to you, what is the latest message, and how many are there. You cannot tell if failures are intended or are a result of some real malfunction. Whether an API call will block forever or not is primarily based on the rolling of multi-faceted die. Yet, everyone seem to be using it and writing exciting blog posts about it. I didn't use RabbitMQ as much, so maybe my impression is too superficial, but it was much better than the one I've got from Kafka: simple API, very little bullshit in documentation, configuration mostly deals with external factors, like certificate locations etc. The defaults are pretty much OK. I used it from Erlang program, but I don't think there's much to be gained from using it this way.
Checkout the Navio2 RaspberryPi add-on https://emlid.com/introducing-navio2/. I've used them and its fantastic. They have [examples](https://github.com/emlid/Navio2/tree/master/Python) of interacting with all the i/o using python.
The global interpreter lock serializes code execution in situations where it might not be safe to have other code running. Thus "lock". Just like a semaphore. However what I'm saying is that it does this for a good reason. And because the gil does not lock every parallel execution (especially mostly not i/o), threads bring a performance increase for many applications. Multiprocessing has some more overhead but scales even better. Yes, I know what it is and what it does, but I also know that it's something good and not something bad as most ppl think it is. And when python is used correctly, the performance impact of the gil is very small.

The message is misleading as this typically is with MS products, but you can sort of guess what the problem is. Stack frames don't reside in modules, that's absurd. Stack frames are run time objects whose source code may be taken from a module. However, since the code of stack frame is typically tied to some physical file (but not necessarily so) it is possible that you need to look for ways in your MSVS copy to tell it where those files have been placed (this will depend on how you obtained the library you are using). Maybe you installed it as an egg archive, but MSVS doesn't know how to open these archives? Maybe you did a source install with pip, but MSVS doesn't know the Python sources can be in the source install directory? Maybe you added this library by modifying PYTHONPATH variable, but MSVS has no clue what the new value is? I also seriously doubt that MSVS comes with the genuine built-in Python debugger. Most likely it simply interfaces with an existing one, like `pdb`. You'd be better served by just using the real thing, than the bizarre shell written around it: at least, you'd have fewer failure points.
What exactly did you guys tried to implement?
it should be called *pyruinbackwardscompatibility*.

It's considered to be the best way to format strings currently
 &gt;&gt;&gt; ", ".join(str(i) for i in range(26))
I prefer f-strings when the embedded expressions are short. If they are long, I use `.format()`.
Just make the long expression a variable on the previous line and use f-strings.
I listen to a lot of podcasts/old radio show recordings on youtube. But its a pain as youtube doesn't run in the background or when the screen is off. So i used a python library called pafy that allows me to fetch audio streaming urls of YouTube videos. I have made a django app with an admin panel where i can add the url of any youtube playlist and it will populate the database with the audio urls of its videos. Then i have a basic html page where I call an api on that same django app to fetch those urls and play them through &lt;audio&gt; tags. Here's the link - pranav.bitballoon.com
Music, lights, socket slug, movies, ... Everyday
Update, I found the gpiozero library, which can interface with gpio, thus with servos. Thanks for the help
Thanks I'll check em out :) 
Think you misread my question :) 
Does look quite concise. I stopped used % in favour of .format some time back because it was recommended, but this seems better.
I like that it nudges towards meaningful and sensible variable names; boy do I need that encouragement!
If it's a few hundred integers every minute, I might not use a database. If you want practice working with databases, make a decision based on the difficulty of getting the database setup. I've had good experiences with MySql, though I'm sure there's other fine alternatives.
Look into SQLlite3. This is a python library for interacting with the database and the instance is run locally within the program. Also, you create the database file, so you can transfer the entire database from machine to machine. I use this functionality a lot in my line of work. Hope this helps! Good luck with the project!
Its not working for me on iPhone 7. I click on a link and it keeps looping back. Also when the list does come up, it just stays in loading and not playing. Not sure if I’m the only one having this issue 
This belongs in /r/learnpython That's not a lot at all to be honest. Pretty much any database would work fine. The big issue is how much historical data you'll be keeping in your database. If its limited you'll do just fine with sqlite, but I suspect you'll need to move to something like PostgresSQL or MySQL. The number of queries or transactions you perform are absolutely tiny compared to what any reasonable computer could do (we're taking many thousands, if not hundreds of thousands per second per thread). I would recommend PostgresSQL. What will be most important to you isn't the database, but how you access it. You could access it via traditional SQL queries, but I recommend using an ORM like SQLAlchemy. This makes queries really easy as well as entering data into the database trivial. Since you're not experienced I really recommend this route. What type of stock trading bot are you going for? Why are you building one? If you're new to Python, you're probably being a little over ambitious.
I use an android so i didn't get chance to test this on an iPhone. Might be that safari isn't supporting that particular audio format maybe. If you have chrome could you try it on that? Let me know if it works
I’m on Reddit mobile and it opens within Reddit app so safari doesn’t even pop up
There is an issue called: "f-string upgrade doesn't catch everything" :D
Thanks mate, exactly what I was looking for :). Wow they go pretty in depth! 
Might be an iPhone issue then. I posted the link on r/louisck and it worked for a lot of them. I guess i'll need to find an iphone i can test this on and debug
Honestly, a Pi would be fine. Your single biggest latency component would be your network infrastructure and typology. So my recommendation would be to focus on that. Your primary concern should be geographic distance between clients and server. Minimize that first and foremost. An easy way to do that would be to using a VPS - I recommend Amazon since its easy to choose your server location and they have servers literally everywhere. I would not recommend you try to do a CDN or distributed server typology or something of that nature. its too complicated and not worth it. Find a single, most optimal server location that minimizes the average distance between clients and the server and go for that. Secondary concern should be reducing the number of hops queries make; however this is essentially uncontrollable and reducing your geographic distance almost always takes care of this as well. Tertiary concerns would be the code, the OS, the firewall configuration and so on. In which case, the code should be efficient and you should make use of async if you suspect you'll be IO bound. The OS should be stripped down linux with as much realtime stuff enabled as possible (doubt this will actually make a real difference though) and use a kernel not userspace firewall. If you run the Pi behind a router at home then don't run a firewall on it (the router should be running one already) and make sure the router isn't garbage. There, you're done! Ethernet over USB2 or the use of a Pi will not add any kind of measurable overhead.
This is what one would call bad data visualisation. Not a little bad, like useless bad. Wrong kind of graph, information isn't clearly portrayed, inconsistent style (if you want to do a hand drawn style then do it consistently), and nothing meaningful can be easily drawn from it.
By far the hardest lesson I've learned in my years of professional development is to only solve the problems I have *right now*, particularly in Python. When I was doing a lot of stuff in Java and C++ I was forever trying to write flexible solutions that would cover future use cases that I hadn't hit yet because it was such an absolute ball ache to change the structures after the fact, or such a mess if you did and had to have backward compatibility. That lead to a constant temptation to have layer apon layer of classes in big hierarchies with abstract methods all over the place just-in-case-I-need-that-later. I'm not saying that's at all good practice in those languages, I was a much less mature dev back then, but something Python taught me was at the core of its double-edged sword. You can fix use cases later. Solve the problems you have right now in front of you, and solve them three times before you abstract them. Cut-n-paste code between methods with small changes, or large ones, and do that a couple of times so you see the bigger picture. When you do see the bigger picture, *then* abstract it. Don't try to stuff all Apples and Oranges into class Fruit up front, when you discover your project also needs Lettuce and they all need .harvest() then you should make class Plant. Python is absolutely wonderful with this, particularly because it's duck-typed and has @property. You can change a stored value into something that uses a getter and setter without the rest of the code seeing it. You can wrap things into classes without the rest of the code caring. It's at the very core of why Python can be so slow, name lookups are hard when they can be overridden, but it's key to why the language works so well. You need to pair this with minimalism, learning to let your imagination run wild but when writing code show restraint. I wrote a large-ish project a long time ago where I tried to cover bases before I got to them, and it's a nightmare to maintain because of it. I look at that project now and see so many places I could have made it much, much simpler if I'd just not bothered to cover some imagined use case it turned out I never needed anyway. Programming is a craft, and as with learning any craft we cover a curve of starting simple, learning more complex things, then trying to apply them everywhere before finally learning to simplify again.

Looking for a Python filtering HTTP proxy to extend. I found [CherryProxy](https://www.decalage.info/python/cherryproxy) but currently support only Python2.
This looks a bit like an Android or other mobile game to me. If it is, you're in for a world of pain. If its just a pc game with weird aspect ratio, then I'd use tensorflow, and opencv to make a neural net to play the game, and let it train overnight. You'll have to hard code some stuff in for starting a new game once you die, but yeah, this wouldn't be hard. Probably a nice little thing to put together for a tutorial. You'll also have to be clever about how you extract the score out of the game since that will be critical for programming the neural net. I suspect opencv and come OCR will have you covered there as well.
That is quite cool, what would be the benefits over using Peewee vs Straight SQLite + Dataset?
matplotlib is fine for plenty of things, especially if your data isn't a dataframe and isn't statistical or categorical. I'm usually working with engineering data like pressure vs time from multiple sensors where the times aren't syncronized or even regularly spaced. In these cases I just want to loop over some data and plot each curve and perhaps a smoothed/filtered version, then add dots at important features or a red line indicating a limit. Other times I'm plotting geometry in order to model a simple mechanical system. These are not things that seaborn or ggplot knows how to do. Actually, plotly and Descartes are cool for some geometry problems, but those still rely on the developer to use matplotpib directly. If anything I've started dropping seaborn now that matplotlib.style.use is better and gives me access to seaborn styles. Palletable may also replace one of my main other uses for seaborn which is color pallettes. I still love seaborn for the stuff in their gallery when I do have a stats problem, I just don't need it for styles or colors or the data I work with. Also I'm often using statsmodels more for stats and want better control over the regression, causing me to wish I had better control than seaborn provides for lmplot and regplot for instance. That just leaves their fancy distribution plots I guess for me.

I prefer not to use them for short scripts, but they really help me when working on something large and refactoring a lot. As for the documentation value, consider a situation when you have heavily nested data types. For example: you have polygons (that might contain holes) on a plane tessellation. A figure consists of multiple contours, a contour consists of vertices, a vertex consists of two coordinates. So you have a list of lists of pairs of ints. AND THEN you have a function that returns a generator of figures. So it returns a generator of lists of lists of pairs of ints. Good luck destructuring that. How would you name it or document it so you can still understand what it does? It would be hard to pack all the information in its name. It would be hard to ensure that the docs remain up to date. With type hints, you can describe it in a very concise manner: Vertex = Tuple[int, int] Contour = List[Vertex] Figure = List[Contour] def figures() -&gt; Iterator[Figure]: ... Of course, there are different ways (like making Figure not an alias for a list of contours but a class that contains a list of contours and has some well-named method for accessing it), but it typically takes longer and often still is less readable.
&gt; Would they live in a single "dead battery" namespace or each using the existing module name? I would suggest to name it `__past__`, so that you can do `from __past__ import &lt;something&gt;`
Using threads is a much nicer experience than using asyncio.
&gt; docstrings filled up with English explanations Sometimes you might consider yourself lucky if the docstring is in a language you understand.
You must be joking.
No.
I love f-strings, but every time I release code I have to weigh up the syntactic elegance with the fact that using f-strings will alienate any potential users who have not upgraded to 3.6. Now if there were a project that could rewrite my f strings as .format(), I could easily offer multiple builds, but it’s a bit of a hassle to go through and change it all manually so I normally end up using format() from day one 
I do some amateur photography and enjoyed using gmic's gimp plugin and tried to use .bat files to automate processing in a directory, but it was too manual so I made a script to automate the process, with groups and some other features. Still in a beta stage but it does work already. Github.com/AlexsaniKY/AutoGmic
1. What's the point of using threads when they don't give you real parallelism anyway because of GIL? Using concurrency based on event loop makes much more sense when you need non-blocking I/O. 2. In which parallel universe operating raw low-level primitives (threads, locks, etc) is "a much nicer experience" than using nice abstractions (coroutines, futures, etc) with some syntactic sugar (async/await)?
Have you checked the Python Cookbook? It's task oriented and meant to show the "proper" way to write python code.
1. asyncio doesn't give you parallelism either? And I/O isn't bound to the GIL (asyncio even just runs DNS queries in a thread anyway). 2. This universe, where asyncio is a horrible library and makes it hard to write correct async code. The additional layer of complexity (and footguns) isn't worth it over threads.
&gt; asyncio doesn't give you parallelism either? It doesn't, but it also doesn't gives you an overhead of using real (OS-level threads). Creating a coroutine is much cheaper than spawning a thread. &gt; asyncio is a horrible library and makes it hard to write correct async code Well... asyncio is definitely not perfect, but writing async code using asyncio is still much easier than wring multi-threaded code. For example: asyncio can't switch to another coroutine in arbitrary moment, so generally you don't have to think about locks. If you use threading you have to always think about how do you manage shared state and if you don't bad things will happen.
Well, this is not really a daily task but in the school I had to send to my teacher all the Javascript exercises from w3school web (I know Javascript and that webpage is so boring to learn, thats ridiculous) and the exercises were too easy. I had to make them all and for that I did a script that scraped the web for the solutions which are in the web too, and create every file for every exercises with the correct solution beautified. About 80 or 90 exercises, too much work for copy-paste hahahaha
If you feel like type hints are bloating your code you have probably only seen them used wrong (Java-style instead of ML-style). Type hints can often result in *less* code.
I made a script that tracks how much time I spend on each project, and will add some plots about when I work on what [github.com/nielsrolf/worklogs](https://github.com/nielsrolf/worklogs)
Also, your flair says `curio is the future!`. I've just googled it and found out that it is a library for concurrent I/O based on an event-loop. I don't know why you are advocating for using threads, lol
async/await using asyncio comes with a large set of footguns, such as managing the event loop everywhere, making it incredibly trivial to DoS yourself, needing threads anyway to interact with the Python ecosystem, needing that synchronization between async functions anyway, etc. In that respect, threads around sockets are better than asyncio because you don't need to keep the entire headspace of the cruft of the library around. Contrast it with [curio](https://curio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [trio](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which are actually good implementations of async/await on Python and are better than threads.
I advocate for threads over asyncio, not threads over async/await. Coroutines are obviously superior, but asyncio is a shoddy implementation.
Maybe, at this scale, you could give the TinyDB Python package a try.
Hmm, makes sense :)
Really helpful, thanks!
&gt; Coroutines are obviously superior Okay, I was mostly arguing for coroutines over threads not for asyncio particularly. Asyncio definitely has its flaws.

Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. While I was at it, I checked [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) but I couldn't find a useful result Though fair warning, this section of the my code is under development, and I don't expect these links to be very useful. *** ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative)
&gt; curio or trio which are actually good implementations of async/await on Python Maybe they are, but they are not in the standard library. It means that infrastructure around them is much less rich and developed than the infrastructure around asyncio. There is an asyncio library for almost everything (i. e. aiohttp for http, aiopg for postgres, etc). Are there a lot of libraries supporting curio/trio? I don't think so. Also, the fact that asyncio is in the stdlib means that it is supported by Python core developers which gives you certain guarantees. What will happen if authors of curio/trio will decide that that they are not interested in supporting in improving these libraries anymore? I will definitely watch over these projects, but for real-world production development I am going to stick with asyncio for now.
Don't break backwards compatibility just for the sake of it, damn. This tool takes a perfectly code base and makes it only run on the latest and greatest machines. Most OSes don't even have 3.6 yet! 
Not a book, but have you looked at the [Official Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)?
I second this. The tutorial is quite good and it should take you only a couple of hours to get through it. Real proficiency with any language comes only after using it for some projects.
I got fed up with treating my many types of experiments manually, at the same time their quantity grew a lot. So I made one major script to intelligently treat and plot a ton of noisy experiments, and two small scripts to extract the important parts of the data files. For the rest I reuse snippets in jupyter notebooks as needed, which also organises the data, the analysis process and the results into one neat file. It's great. I've been showing this to my labmates but unfortunately they are all averse to anything computer related more complex than what they're used to, even if it would mean saving them several hours of boring work. It's been a bit frustrating. I'm planning on documenting this in my PhD thesis so I can convince my successors to work a bit more intelligently. One funny thing that happened was that a girl came back from a visit with a software that required the data file to be formatted in a specific way. My colleagues froze when trying to find out how to convert their data to the required format, even though they had a functioning file. I worked out what was necessary by comparison, trial and error, and a bit of patience. Then I made a very simple script to do this conversion and, to put a cherry on top, made an executable with pyinstaller. The process didn't last 3 hours in total. They thought I was a genius and were relieved they wouldn't have to pay a ton of money to get a professional to write a file conversion program, as was recommended by some. In reality it was really simple, and I believe the laurels are exaggerated. I'm not a genius, I'm just patient and have some perseverance.
The csv is different Everytime and is a file on your computer?
If you can, avoid starting with PDF, since PDF doesn't contain the document structure (it's a page-description language). Try using Word / LibreOffice to convert the Word doc to an xml-based format. LibreOffice ".odt" formats are preferable as they are easier to understand. Then use the standard python tools to extract the .odt archive (zipfile) and parse the xml to pull out text and images and write to a Jupyter notebook JSON format. I'm not sure if there are any libraries to simplify writing jupyter notebooks directly. If not, you'll need to create the json structure yourself. The .odt specification is here: http://docs.oasis-open.org/office/v1.2/os/OpenDocument-v1.2-os.html . It may appear intimidating but if you work through it, getting the text, headings and images shouldn't be too hard.
That *really* depends on what code you're writing.
Nice article, thanks for putting in the extra work on the screenshots.
If you rely on your OS' python, you're asking to break something. Always install a separate python that you can mess with.

There are two hard problems left in computer science - naming things and cache invalidation and off-by-1 errors.
As stated, it doesn't make a lot of sense. You want to write cached information to a file so when your program runs again it doesn't have to read the CSV file but reads the cache file instead. Maybe you can explain your problem in more detail? It only makes sense to cache data if you are performing some expensive process and you cache the results of that process so you don't have to do the expensive process again.
My first use was to track the IP of my home computer so I could 'ssh' to it. Basically I had a python script that would query a web service for it's IP every 10 minutes or so. If the IP changed the script would email me the change. I had it running as a daemon and everything.
I use python to control cheap proprietary Bluetooth thermostats with the built-in BT-chip of the Raspberry Pi Zero W. The python script is basically the middleware between the thermostats and my home automation system (iobroker).
&gt; You can use asyncio to make the GIL irrelevant for IO-bound workloads. The GIL is already irrelevant for multithreaded IO bound programs. And in fact, asyncio is worse for them because coroutines can't be preempted like threads can (which is kind of the point of asyncio). So one gummed up coroutines locks the event loop preventing anything from happening whereas with threads a gummed up thread will eventually be preempted and allow others to run.

At your level of experience, it might cost you more in time to automate said job than to actually do it and get paid. Just something to consider if your goal is to be profitable. 
Don’t use a database. Use a python data structure first and if that doesn’t support your throughput you can use a DB. For what you’re describing I don’t think you need the overhead of a SQL database.

I made a python program to scrape my attendance/test-report data from my college's website and send it to me via Telegram. I also use the data to calculate how much attendance I'll lose if I bunk certain lectures &amp; other stuff. Some background: I got into my first year of engineering last year. My college is very strict about attendance (I know right?) and they periodically put out a list of students with insufficient attendance and bust their balls. I do not wish to have my name up their so I worked out a solution. Also, I'm very lazy and hate logging into their site all the time, fill the shitty captcha to check attendance, so this program helps. [Here's the link.](https://github.com/ArionMiles/MIS-Bot) Features include: - **Attendance report**: fetches screenshot of attendance report and saves the value of total conducted and attended lectures in database for use by other functions - **Test report**: fetches screenshot of test results. This feature quickly made the bot popular in my college since the webpage which shows test reports exists but there is no link to it on the website's page, which lead to many students not even knowing of its existence until I made the feature. - **Bunk Calculator**: Calculates the drop/rise in attendance in your overall percentage if you wish to bunk x lectures out of y total lectures. - **Until80**: So my college is very strict in regards to attendance. If attendance falls below 80, you get your name in defaulter's list, and if it's below 75, you also have to call your parents. This function gives me the total number of lectures I must _consecutively_ attend so that my attendance is above 80% It saved me in the first sem as my attendance was 80.62% due to this function. - **CAPTCHA Bypass**: So after the last time I posted about the bot on reddit, they might have observed strange traffic on the college website, and they put a captcha on the login. With the help from a friend I was able to bypass their captcha automatically. [Here's his captcha solving library.](https://github.com/sampritipanda/securimage_solver) It's available for every student who studies in my college (not just limited to my field) and right now some ~20~ 50 odd students including me are using it. I'd love to have your inputs!

Look into Selenium for automating the web.
I had the EXACT same experience as you, while I was working at a law firm! I was scripting/automating a lot of the repetitive tasks using C++, AutoHotKey, and Windows Batch files and scheduled tasks. I tried to show my colleagues some of my automated scripts, and how many hours it could save them as well per week, and even volunteered to make the scripts for them... Yes, I volunteered my own free time to help them. But surprisingly they refused and were highly reluctant, and some even seemed insulted I would volunteer to help them do their work faster. -------------------------------- What worse... in one instance, there was a bit of a complicated ratio-calculation we had to make repeatedly when calculating compensation benefits. So I made a quick C++ program in which you just entered the numbers, and it did the calculation for you, and showed each step of the calculation (which we needed to put into our report). The boss (our head lawyer) saw me using it, and then actually "ordered" the other employees to use it. One of the employees actually got really seriously angry at me because of that. I was like, "Umm... sorry I honestly never told the boss to force you to use this program. He just saw me using it, and said he wanted everyone else to start using it. But... anyways... don't you find it easier to just plug in the numbers?" She said she preferred doing it "her way" instead, and that she had been doing it that way for years, and did just fine... thank you very much... Even though it was obviously saving her significant time. Like they say: "No good deed goes unpunished." I did what I thought was a good deed of saving the firm hours and hours of work each week, but I was punished with anger and disdain from some of the colleagues. Humans are complex and strange creatures at times! -------------------------------- Anyways... the lesson I learnt from this: If you can make your own job faster and easier through automation... then just do it, and keep quite about it, and keep it to yourself! If someone else notices and has a genuine interest/fascination in also automating, then by all means teach them. But otherwise... just do it, and enjoy the benefits of getting your own work done much easier and faster than your colleagues! NOTE: especially in your position, in which you are working with highly intelligent PhD level people, I would have thought they would have been more open to automation. But... I guess people are people... human psychology at any level of work is complicated and full of non-rational, annoying office politics!

Effective Python will show you how to do things in a Pythonic manner. You can build off your knowledge of other languages.
&gt; Python is absolutely wonderful with this, particularly because it's duck-typed and has @property. You can change a stored value into something that uses a getter and setter without the rest of the code seeing it This is one of the things I love about it, and don't understand the calls for stricter type checking. You shouldn't care what type it is, you care if it has the methods and properties you want.
Hahaha I dont know, but I just used code to "learn" code, so I just really know how to code in essence
Not mine but to save someone else's time. I'm a contributor to the [Securedrop](http://securedrop.org) project. All their developer communication takes place on a Gitter channel. They have daily developer meetings on Jitsi as well, for which the Project Manager had to post a message every weekday just as a reminder to everyone on the channel (and if someone is new). Copying/pasting a message everyday at exactly the same time everyday was a hassle, so I wrote a Gitter bot to automate the process. Now the PM can schedule messages to be posted any time of the day for any number of days. Just specify the message(s), time(s) and day(s) to the bot and and it will go post a reminder on the Gitter channel. Then, I added support for interacting with the bot via messaging it. For example, if due to some unforeseen circumstances, the daily meeting got cancelled and the PM does not want the bot to post a message, he can just message the bot to blacklist that day. So now they don't have to worry that they have to post a reminder at the correct time everyday, saving them some time and headache. Another thing is I wrote the bot to be a generalist, so it can be easily used to send scheduled messages to any other Gitter channel. I'll post the code if someone is interested in taking a look.

One of the things I use python for is automating downloads of resources from home. - I have a DropBox file named "download.q" which is just a list of urls that's synced on my phone and work computer. - If I see stuff I want to save for later I'll open the file and paste a link in there. - The process runs every few minutes at home and checks to see if there's anything in the file, then pulls it off and downloads The Thing locally, then removes the entry from the file. It's not SO interesting right now. But my next version will take some basic commands so it can call ytdownloader or add stuff to shopping/todo lists and such. 
Pretty nice work. I am surprised that you made it in python.
Right now I'm working on building a homebrew temperature controller that connects to an app on my phone so I don't have to constantly monitor temperature during my brew day 
Agreed. If you want to dedicate time to make a real game I’d probably advise against python due to performance

There's a lot of value in it particularly when you're providing libraries to others. It can magically help out IDEs and save you a lot of pain yourself, but you don't have to type *everything*. I find typing absolutely everything only to have value on module boundaries, but inside my main app code it gets too noisy. Fortunately Python being Python you just don't have to do it if you don't want, and when you find you do need it it's worth its weight in gold.

Java needs cumbersome workarounds for that (at least it did the last time I checked).

For example, I have had last-year undergrads not know how to plot a line and do a linear fit in any tool whatsoever. I learned Python almost a year ago now, and I love it. I'm using it for everything, and I expect to have saved an absurd amount of time so far, and enabled me to do some studies which would have been prohibitively time consuming before.

Interesting story! It's nice to see people facing the same problems as me. I think I would have done the same things as you did. &gt; If you can make your own job faster and easier through automation... then just do it, and keep quite about it, and keep it to yourself! Yeah, I came to the same realization. It's sad, but I think it's the truth, at least for the set of people we had to work with. I will gladly teach how to use anything I did, and I will document my work so that someone with the interest will be able to follow in my footsteps. But, as you said, humans are complicated.
Yeah probably. I had stopped because I got really busy with school, then when I started to pick it up again I needed to refresh everything, so I started on sololearn.com. it was pretty good, at least for learning stuff fast I already had learned, and then I got really busy again... But then I made an actual functioning reddit bot which got banned and I haven't touched programming since
