I am trying to build an automated plex server updater for linux. Purely for learning because there is a fully working bash script someone wrote already.
It might be slightly off-topic, but I did a few years ago a project where we were estimating distance a to ROI using the face square as a reference. Basically the width of the face can be used as a reference. You obviously need to calibrate the number of pixels of the face to the actual distance to it, but it might work better than the hight because it's easier to contain a face in an image frame than it is to contain a full person. The width of the face is quite constant.
How do you find open-sourced projects to contribute to?
&gt; The only difference I've noticed is the virtualenv is running pip 8.0.2, whereas externally it's running pip 8.1.2. Just to eliminate this, you can upgrade pip inside the virtualenv and then try the install.

I've been messing around with learning about Markov chains so I made this thing https://github.com/TrevorEdris/markovify_twitter It's been a pretty fun project so far!
Good point, I'll try this.
Hey, just wanted to quickly get back to this and say thanks again. I've signed up and it works an absolute treat. No messing with servers, command lines or any of that jazz. I see it also supports FTP which I'll be using to updating scripts. Perfect. 
Github is a great starting point; plenty of projects to dig through. You can have a look at some Python projects [here](https://github.com/topics/python).
You are thinking the wrong way about this. There is obviously a syntax error in do_things(the missing parenthesis after the function name), but the exception for that error is not thrown when the function is executed, but when the function is defined, i.e. when def is executed. try: def do_things: jdsfgsdgfkljgh do_things() except Exception as e: logger.exception() should catch and log a SyntaxError
Short answer: You can. Long answer: The code above breaks before logging because indentation is wrong, so it is not even compiling, therefore your code is not running at all. Try -&gt; except is used as a wrapper for another piece of code that may raise and exception. It would look something like this (just coding, not tested): import random class MyException(Exception): pass def raise_ex(): if random.randint(0,2) &gt; 1: raise MyException else: raise Exception def main(): try: raise_ex() except MyException: # This exception is thrown if random is &gt; 1 pass except Exception: # When it is not, this exception is thrown pass
Bad example, sorry. How about this? def do_things: print undefined_var try: do_things() except Exception as e: logger.exception()
My example wasn't great. I answered the other reply's with a better one.

Have a hobby. Dive into the programming side of it. You'll almost certainly find something unless your hobby is like metalcrafting or something.
Your example seems still broken, after some fixing: def do_things(): print(undefined_var) try: do_things() except Exception as e: print("EX") print(e) It prints: EX name 'undefined_var' is not defined Which is the expected result. Also try..except does not "look into" anything, when an exception is thrown the stack is walked backwards(or upwards, if you prefer) until a try..except block is encountered that tries to catch the exception or until there is no stack left.

This is the Python sub right? I thought I could come here for help and not be downvoted. This is why I'm afraid to ask anything. 
The two most important ingredients, imo, are having real projects to work, and having a motivation to work on them (money). So given that you have those, my recommendation is this: every single task you do, see if you can do better. It may seem like it's vague, but that vagueness is the key. To become better, you have to start instinctively seeking out information instead of being told stuff (e.g. in instructional videos). Just foster the urge to do things better, and then over time you will get better.
Many IaaS/PaaS providers have automated deployment for flask/django, right? Even godaddy has a django service.
My best recommendation is to use VirtualBox and do all this in an isolated linux VM...sorry I can't be of more help!
Neat!
&gt; I feel that it was never that good and I think I could do a lot better if I am more expert in Python. Yeah I'm gonna have to say a strong fucking no here. You could do it better if you were an expert in agent systems or in AI in general. I fucking hate that so many people still believe in this bullshit about languages, I've literally written in 10s of different languages and like 8 or 9 I think professionally and let me tell you - expertise in any language doesn't make you an expert in engineering or any specialized field. Knowing Python well won't make you an AI expert. And that means that you won't be able to produce better software which all engineers should strive to. If you want to become a better engineer - try other languages. Try other frameworks, other types of projects and all that - break your thinking patterns in short. Try Assembly or C, try Prolog/Erlang/Haskell, try Go/Rust, try Lisp (I highly recommend that one, I think its a must for everyone, gives a good perspective on how compilers/interpreters work and on computing in general). 
You need to pass a "message" argument to `logger.exception`, or it won't work (you'll get an exception about missing arguments). When you're asking for programming help, it's extremely valuable to provide a [Short, Self Contained, Correct Example](http://sscce.org/). Your examples so far are short and self contained enough, but they're not correct, since they have other errors that may or may not be the reason you're not seeing the results you expect. The burden of trying to figure out which of those errors is the source of your problem and which are just artifacts of the example code makes it difficult to offer you much help. I'm unable to verify your issue with correct code. When I correctly call `logger.exception("foo")`, I get a traceback that includes the source of the exception in the function.
Can you please make a tutorial running a script over time? Or is that not possible in Blender?

What version of Python?
You can tell sublime to use a different python https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34865717/use-conda-environment-in-sublime-text-3
I'm not sure I can answer. For your use case... Maybe. Maybe not. Lucene has lots of optimizations that might help your use case. They might not... As per most things in CS. Give it a try and see what happens.
Oh man, I was in that audience. When he said async metaclass at 10am, I thought my brain was gonna explode. 
HAHAHAHAA! From what I have seen of most "experts", your main qualification would be the ignorance, arrogance and self-delusion to call yourself an expert.
We have [a pretty long list of learning resources in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index#wiki_new_to_programming.3F). Try a few and see what resonates. For a brand new programmer I'd recommend codecademy. Also, if you don't have one already make sure you look for a project that interests you and start on it as soon as you can. Programming is a lot more fun if you have a goal. Visit us in /r/learnpython if you get stuck. 
Python Crash Course. tells you the basic syntax then moves onto projects.
thanks!
https://www.codewars.com/ maybe?
The `[::-1]` is part of the slicing syntax. You can get a subset of a data type like a list, string or tuple by defining the [start:stop:step] indexes. If you don't provide values, python uses default values. In this case, we are saying "default start : default stop : step by -1". --- Your function reverses a list by stepping through every element in the list in order, and adding that element *to the front* of a new list. The new list is then in the reverse order of the old list. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
You could also try Arch Linux for ARM. Always gives you the most up to date stuff.
I personally would say if you are an expert python programmer you should also be a pretty good C programmer. If you are an expert you should know just about everything about python from the top to the bottom, remember you are an expert. You should be packages, contributing/ releasing major open source projects, contributing to the specification, etc. I have known people who are experts in languages, being in expert groups of the language, and have helped write the major libraries and such. And their knowledge is scary. I don't think it is possible to become an expert only writing application code, advanced yes, but expert is a category above.
I’d like to put a plug in for PyScripter as a teacher of python for many years, and I’ve gone through many IDEs, but I’ve always come back to PyScripter to have my students install and use in class. Here are a few top reasons for this: 1. There is a no-install option. This is invaluable in today’s corporate environment, especially when you need something ready to use immediately. 2. It just runs/debuts the script that you have open! No solutions, projects or “startup file” nonsense. 3. You can go directly into interactive mode after running your script and interact with everything just defined by your script. This is so useful, and so few IDEs let you do this, and it’s seamless in PyScripter. 4. Its super lightweight and starts up instantly.
Kivy is a thin wrapper over opengl (+ event management), so you could use it, and do more advanced OpenGL things inside it pretty easily. I'm of course biased toward Kivy, as i've been using it for years now, but i really believe it's the most easy/concise way to develop UI with python.
Oh man, number 4 is some of the best advice I could give. taking Algorithms/Data Structures and AI during College helped me go from someone who could write code in one language to someone who could pick up any language easily because I knew the algorithms rather than just the code. 
Using boxes doesn't make you pro at making boxes. 
There's hackerrank if you need the interactivity. One thing I enjoy doing is browsing Rosetta Code's [Programming Tasks](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Programming_Tasks) category, picking a task I'm unfamiliar with, studying it, attempt an implementation, and check it against the existing implementations. Not Python specific, but neither are algorithms and time/space complexity.
Have you ever implemented a module for Python in C language? If not, you can learn alot about Python in doing it!

Wow I've done that but more simply via tensorflow + django + ajax. So I guess I'm sort of pro by your definition. In my definition if you've been paid to professionally code Python aren't you pro? Not that that answers ops request in any practical way..
Is the problem getting solved? Good. Keep it that way. Where you have leeway, research better ways to solve your problems (google, research papers, other programmers, etc.). There’s design patterns to ignore and functional vs imperative programming to argue about, there’s state vs stateless and a bunch of other theoretical ideas. My favorite way to get better at a programming task or language is to think about how the data is getting transformed and come up with more efficient ways to transform it. Do I need to update this list on every state change? Can I just update it when I need to? How do I know when I need to update it? Also, develop software with loose coupling. If everything is an island, it’s way easier to figure out where the fire started, it’s the island that’s on fire, instead of most of California. At the end of the day, software engineering is all about managing complexity and keeping the complexity you have to deal with as low as possible, so you can keep piling the features and usefulness on to keep your job or get a better one. For python specifically, the hardest part it seems for people is using functions as values to be passed around, and understanding how the python object model works (attributes). If you get those down, decorators become down right simple, and classes and other python objects can be bent to your will with ease.
But you can't make boxes if you don't know how to use boxes. And using boxes is the best way to learn how to use them well.
Use command line to install - you should be typing 'pip3 packagename' if I understand you correctly, but have only given a cursory glance.
You want to run Python script running over time (frames)? You can use Animation Nodes or Sverchok add on or check into Blender Game Engine.

I know you got downvoted for what you said, and you did say it in kind of a dick way, but you're not totally wrong. Most people I've ever met who I would consider an expert in their field don't consider themselves experts. They are people who are continually learning, knowing that no matter how much you know about anything, there is always something you don't know. That drive is what makes someone great at what they do. An outsider might call them an expert, to them it's being a student of their craft.
&gt; every single task you do, see if you can do better. That's what I did previously. Problem is I think I have reached the point where progress is impossible without seeking next level knowledge but I don't know what is that knowledge and where do I start
Holy shit. Never think about this. Thanks! Will definitely try this out.
Git gud
If I delete anaconda and remove the path for it would it resolve the problem?
I've been curious about this too. Apparently there is absolutely no difference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/143714/is-there-any-difference-between-string-and-string-in-python
Zero difference whatsoever. `'` is generally preferred, but if you need a string with either quote in it, use whichever one makes that easier.
The difference is that the python shell and `repr` prefer to return `'`. For uniformity sake I prefer the same style.
The difference is that " is annoying and requires backslash-escaping when you have double-quotes in the string literal itself, and ' is equally annoying when you have single-quotes in the string itself. The only difference is that with single quotes it is arguably a little easier to do by accident as single quotes appear as apostrophes in many common contractions and it may not be immediately obvious. Whereas accidental double-quotes in a string literal tend to be fairly obvious as they are more visually striking and less common. Otherwise there is no technical difference that I've ever noticed. Use whichever is appropriate, if there is no strong need for either one, feel free to use your preference, although ideally keep it consistent. Using single-quoted strings is perfectly cromulent if that's what you're comfortable with, although it may cause experienced C programmers' eyes to twitch.
very good, thank you
I like /r/dailyprogrammer
Thanks - it's going well. I can't say I'll be back in here any time soon (not the most friendly community it seems.) but I really appreciate this and the PM's I got.
This Might help you: http://scottlobdell.me/2014/10/install-opencv-heroku-ffmpeg-support/
Ok, so your problem is that you don't know what you don't know and therefore don't know where to start. To that, I'd say, try to emulate what libraries do that you like. For instance decorators: let's say you'd never seen a decorator and you discover some library that gives you utility decorators. Learn decorators... find tutorials, find git hub projects that use them etc etc. I've personally found that in the last 5~10 years, tutorials have become a new form of content syndication and everyone makes them. Often times they are unrealistic, over simplistic, or just not informative. That's my opinion.
Thx :D i shal try every thing. Thx again this will get me started finaly. 
The only difference is what characters need to be escaped "That's the difference." 'That\'s the difference.' "He said, \Thanks\"" 'He said, "Thanks"'
No technical difference, except for which character you have to escape. I prefer single quotes for small stuff, internal variables, single-character or single-word strings, dictionary keys; I prefer double quotes for longer strings such as messages that are presented to the user or logs, or other "prose".
Is it still Octave?
I've tried settling on using only single quotes since they require less typing. I've found that I can't, because the habit of using double quotes for strings and singles for characters is just too ingrained. 
Quite so.

Is there a book to read up on the basics before working on leetcode problems? As someone who did not have any algorithms classes during education. Or should one just start on the problems and read about the theory as they go along?
https://www.udemy.com/biopython/?couponCode=FREEBIOPYTHON
`import pandas as pd`
import datetime as dt import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from matplotlib import style import pandas as pd import pandas_datareader.data as web style.use('ggplot') start = dt.datetime(2000,1,1) end = dt.datetime(2017,10,17) df = web.Datareader('TSLA', 'yahoo', start, end) print(df.head()) i wrote this and its still can't find pandas 
Reading the leetcode solution is okay but many times users go above and beyond the intended solution so it ends up doing more harm than good if you're just trying to learn. But yes, books help a lot. CLRS is the gold standard but its very dense so its hard to digest. I would recommend Algorithms by Christos Papadimitriou, Sanjoy Dasgupta, and Umesh Vazirani. The pdf is online. If you find that too hard then Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick is a good place to start. You don't have to read the entire book, the most important topics are probably * basic array manipulation * binary search * dfs/bfs on trees and graphs * mergesort and heapsort * linkedlist manipulation and cycle detection * shorted paths and minimum spanning trees * dynamic programming and O(N) string search
There's your next business opportunity!
Thanks
Are you sure you installed pandas in the right version of python? pip3 install pandas
now it's saying "No module named "pandas_datareader"" 
alright. i installed pandas-datareader but now it's saying it has no attribute 'Datareader'
You need to install that package separately: pip3 install pandas-datareader
it worked. fucking gangster. thanks bro
also, why is there a rocket ship just bouncing in my application thing? the application is called 'Python' but it won't open.
I agree with learning a lisp. I had fun with clojure and clojurescript and it gave me totally different view on how to think about programming. For example I recently wrote a python program where it loops through a list of functions that all take a dict as an argument. To change the process I just need to give it a different list of functions. I would never had thought to code in this style if I had not learned a lisp language. I can now easily plug in modules to support different vendors and OS deployments.
Yep, that's a good question. Python is a great language for learning to code. But so many resources teach Python by using fairly boring examples. We use the Pygame library to teach Python by taking the user through the development of 12 arcade style games. The "learning to code is fun" concept is at the heart of what we are doing. Hopefully you can get a better idea of what I mean this from our [projects page](https://mycodeangel.com/projects/)
Python 3
I use double quotes in ugly, utilitarian code like Bash and C++ (and not code but HTML) and I use single quotes in fluffy and lighthearted languages like Python.
Code up a mine sweeper clone. There are a ton of ways you can go about it. You can turn it into a tour of language features, or focus on a particular construct you want to practice. 
Aside from which character you need to escape there is no technical difference. From some Erlang in my past and common presence of single quotes (apostrophes) I tend to use double quotes for human-readable text and single for programmatic strings, but that's for no technical reason. 
I always build my own OpenCV, honestly the packaged binary thing in pip is a really bad idea that has never worked correctly for me.
We use jenkins for build and „pipeline“ automation. Running jupyter notebooks via jenkins pipelines most of the time. Has a gui, tasks can be in code and I find it very easy to start with.

&gt; Learn about things like bubble sort and make them in Python "I think the bubble sort would be the wrong way to go." - Barack Obama
No difference, only when escaping similar characters within the string. Personal practice - I use double quotes (") when I only need to show the string to the user.
I'm by no means an expert but I feel that my python skills have improved by playing around with the features of the language. Some features I've been trying out are: list comprehensions, decorators and mock for unit tests. If anyone could recommend additional useful stuff I'd be grateful :) 
Thank you so much for sharing. I snag an intern gig at a tech start-up doing analytics but on my down time I have been studying Python programming. This is great!
Try going through this curated list of tricky Python code,- [PyTricks](https://github.com/brennerm/PyTricks) 
I prefer double quotes as it is commonly used in English to "quote" text. For me anyways it highlights the departure from code to text.
It was just the first sorting algo that came to mind. 
While maybe not a technical reason double quotes, at least in English speaking countries, should cause a bit of a context switch in your mind when reading code. This should happen in much the same way double quotes should trigger when reading more general text. Admittedly you can get the same effect from a editor setup to properly highlight strings and code.
And I use double quotes because they're easier to see! 
Depend of the dependencies and the context? Are they C based dependencies (and need a compiler), do you have access to internet easily, are the dependencies huge? For example, I use path.py a lot. But this sum up in only one file, so I can embed it in the package. I do a lot of scientific computing, so I assume that Anaconda in installed and I allow myself to use the full scientific stack in that case, etc. If you rewrite a lot of functionnalities, you will loose a part of the python major advantage.

I'm enjoying Project Euler for that. You can usually brute force an answer to unlock the discussion. Then there's usually a PDF explaining algebraic approaches to the problem.

Let me know how that goes!
Regarding project Euler.. some of them require mathematical techniques too.
Thanks! I thought I was the only one using this style.
Interesting, didn’t know this came from erlang.
It probably doesn't come solely from Erlang, but there double quotes are for strings (really linked lists of integers) whereas single quotes are for atoms (interned peudo-strings), so you'd usually use strings in the context of human-readable text (&amp; text processing) but atoms for the more programmatic uses. I thought the idea was quite neat and started using it in languages which allow it (e.g. not Java or C since they use single quotes for the character type).
I try to avoid packages that take a long time to import in case I end up running the script repeatedly, unless there’s a good reason for it. I try to avoid obscure packages maintained by a single person, unless there’s a good reason for it. For scraping I’m personally attached to calling wget via subprocess and writing everything to disk all at once, then going through those files and parsing out what I need. That way if I make a mistake in my code I don’t have to hammer the site with thousands more requests. If you’re doing a more complex spidering task where you’ll be jumping from one host to another, Scrapy would be appropriate ... or you can use Selenium + Chromedriver if you need to render JavaScript content and/or interact with pages.

Use a Docker container so your program will run identically on Mac, Windows, and Linux (desktop or server). Avoiding installing a bunch of dependencies on your co-workers’ local systems is priceless. I’ve had good luck running Flask apps in Ubuntu-based Docker containers.
How would I go about learning 1.4. and 2.3 ? 
+1 on this one. The dude invites you to the places you never new existed. James Powell @dontusethiscode is another good source of wisdom. 
Tried that. Posted in 2014. Sigh 
Each year Pycon happens, and they put most of the talks on YouTube. 
Oh man okay. Cringe. +todo list
Written in 2014 😭
Another difference except the ones that have been mentioned is that according to PEP8, docstrings shall be surrounded by triple double quotation marks, not single quotation marks. But as has been said, no major differences. 
Your ```if turns &gt;= 15``` will never run because of the while
I learned on an 8 bit basic where you had to use ". I moved to C where you still had to use " When I learned Python I trained myself to use ' because it was quicker to type (no shift) and it was more idiomatic. Then I started typing JSON and I went back to " Why did I ever change?
If you make it a micro-service, they won't need to install it ;-)
Great idea! 
Thanks!
You can also check out sentdex on youtube and Corey Schafer. They have quality python videos on advanced topics.
http://www.pythonchallenge.com/ This website has a series of challenges to be solved by writing Python scripts.
Just for a reference, if someone stumbles in this thread, I want to mention that I am eventually using the Sentry (free version for now). It is great and I can recommend it.
Sure i'll check them. Thanks! 
2.3 is actually really easy. If you have a local package, all you need is a setup.py file. There are simple ones online, and you can just reverse-engineer whatever you need in order to install it for your package. Then, using a prompt that has pip installed it's just `pip install -e .` (if you want to be able to edit the source code while you develop, which I do.) I have more detailed instructions somewhere. Let me know if you want them and I'll track them down.
I would recommend skimming the topic lists and videos from previous PyCons. That really opened my eyes to how little I actually know. For example, I thought I was "intermediate", but most of the intermediate-level topics at PyCon Europe 2017 sounded like gibberish to me. So I've got a long way to go. 
The difference doesn't really matter, just remember to keep your code constant, that means if you choose to use "" instead ' ' use in your whole program. : )
Learning other languages may also be a great way to stay fresh in Python, as you will automatically try to map things between Python and the new language, and realize with more precision Python's own limits. 
Many of them can be solved using mathematical techniques, but learning when to use a naive solution is also a good exercise in itself.
Learn the async stuff. Very interesting and quite tricky to master.
That doesn't solve the problem: if you using e.g. ``TypedDict ``, without having mypy installed that will make your progra, fail. That means mypy will be a hard dependency, also for your users.

Is it hard ?
I want to learn, first connect two pc with shell, trough ip adress, tcp protocl, and after I want to write exploits etc ...
And I use single quotes because there is less clutter. 
Double-quotes require you using the shift key more often. 
If it's not popular, I generally don't use it unless it's pure python. Either way, it better not import the world.
When I'm writing C the compiler always complains about my single quoted strings. And then I realize there's no such thing in C. Every time.
The socket API is decent, but if you don't know how sockets work, you'll find it hard.

Is that the steps to distribute a package that anyone can install via pip ?
Not if you have a mock object for it. That's the point. 
You left out Forth.
* Build an IRC-like chat server and client (bonus: use the new async/await libraries). Make it handle multiple users, multiple rooms, logging in, direct messages, etc. See if you can implement file transfers. Try to make the server actually be on the internet (Digital Ocean is a nice way to do this) * Roll your own fully connected neural network. Libraries can handle the matrix multiplication, but you handle the network structure, the forward propagation, the loss calculation, the backprop, the training, and the testing. Bonus: allow the user to specify the network structure (number and sizes of input, hidden, and output layers), allow users to choose squashing functions (sigmoid, tanh, step, etc), and give it a GUI. * Use Flask to build a content management service like a micro blogging platform. 
If i find one. Ill let you know. Cheers man. 
Yes, it's almost identical to Step 2.2, you just need to add a setup file in the top level of the repository. (To my knowledge) An example would be how this repo is structured: https://github.com/jennirinker/PyEvent Disclaimer: I am hella not an expert coder, and that package is very much under development. So I wouldn't actually install it. But the setup file and installation instructions should help.
Cool ! I wouldn't have guessed it was *that* simple.
One usage is that you can include on in the other without having to escape. So you can write *"It's this"*. Or *'to "quote" something'*.
Can't you inline variables within a string in Python?
Yeah, I couldn't believe it either. Now I basically install everything haha. I've looked at that guide many times before. I like it. :)
Maybe look at Kivy
Where user is the actual variable containing the data. '{} welcome! Last logon: {}'.format(user, last_login) '{0} welcome! Last logon: {1}'.format(user, last_login) '{name} welcome! Last logon: {last}'.format(name=user, last=last_login) '{User} welcome! Last logon: {last_logon}'.format(**locals())
Ah, good ol' C. I use single quotes for everything because of my PHP background, where double quotes allows string interpolation.

Do you mean converting an image of a graph to an array of values? 
What you're looking for is known as a "graph digitizer". Google it, you'll find a lot of free, open source options!
I think a good improvement going forward would be to allow any number of passwords required. Also, line 73 probably needs a `with`. Line 69 to 72 might be a good candidate for a list comprehension. I'd probably include more compound statements as well. 
learning the basic because I am a newbie
Yes, for example, extracting data from graphs like these: https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/what-smart-meters-are-telling-us-about-microgrid-use.
Python 3.6 adds `f'{user} welcome! Last logon: {last_logon}'`.
not directly related to your question, but i got into the habit of using single quotation marks after diving deep into python. one annoying side effect of that is that my phone recognizes single quotes as being part of the word while ignoring double quotes. this means my autocorrect dictionary now has a lot of words with single quotes appearing as its own word.
I hate C++ omitting feature, `self`helps me immediately spot non-local variables.
Use cron :) Or while True with time.sleep.
_ is usually used to indicate a variable in a loop that you don't actually use. I find your second snippet much more confusing than the first. Yes it's annoying to type self a bunch but it's definitely the python standard.
I personally don't, but I've been writing python code for about 8 years now. It just kind of fades into the background. Tbh, I really prefer languages that require you to refer to the self/this variable because it really reduces ambiguity to essentially nothing, and makes autocomplete much simpler. If you want to have it shortened in your code, that's your decision. Just expect other python programmers to be put off by it. I would recommend using s instead of an underscore. It's still shorter, but doesn't conflict with the standard dummy variable name of `_` that is often used in loops, tuple matching, and ipython uses it to refer to the last statement's output value. 
Because I program in other languages, I've made it a habit to use single quote for characters, and double quotes for strings... I really think it doesn't matter, it's just nice to not need to escape contractions all the damn time, and not make mistakes when switching languages. 
&gt; Does nobody else have this readability issue? It never bothered me. We can't omit it because that would make a local variable, which is very different from an instance variable. But you can use any variable name you want. If you like underscores then by all means use it. However, you will confuse other programmers. Conforming with others is very powerful, hence PEP8 and probably what Guido was driving at. 
great! one of my first ide when started learning python. good to know it has been revived
So single for what would be a Symbol in JS or Ruby
I love that the Trump/Jaden one Has The Correct Casing For Every Word.
* Allow more than two passphrases; as many as the user wants. * List comprehension in lines 46 to 49 and 69 to 72 About `with` in line 73: I thought that would don't be necessary because the use off that `open()` is bit. But, if you recommend me that, I will change that. What you refer with "compound statements"? Thanks!
Ordinarily, if it's possible to detect an error and raise an exception from within the method, you should. That way, you don't have to remember to check the return value everywhere you call the method.
Yes it is you :-) just get used to self. And if your reference self.something a lot of times in your code then just do a st = self.something before first use. Code like example 2 would be changed in any good shop during a code review for not being standard. Furthermore if you use object attributes enough that it bothers you, you should probably use a more functional style. Most methods should not have many self in them. But that is a much larger subject.
Looks like you accidentally dropped a ")" on the preceding line.
If the `open` fails for any reason, the code will not handle it gracefully. The first open is only securing the first file, I don't know if the second file is also secured, but I don't believe it is. As for compound statements, you can write things like this: key = sha256().update(bytes(s_password, 'utf-8')) Saves a few lines. You could even add more if you wanted, but it might affect the readability. This is still fairly readable though, it's the result of `sha256` updated with the result of `bytes`. 
Yep, missing the closing parenthesis for the ‘int’ function. I see this a lot when students start nesting functions! 
I’ve used Spyder and don’t really like it - is it mandatory to use it?
I really want to use this everywhere but it means that code relies on 3.6 and many places don't have it yet.
Ah yes. Thanks so much, I would never have caught that
Think carefully about who should handle the error. If I try to `open` a file and it fails, I should probably be the one to handle it. If I write some code that might raise and exception, and I should be the one to handle it, I'd do it myself. Technically, the for loop only knows to stop because of exceptions.
Or, in 3.6, the wonderfully readable f'{name} welcome! Last logon: {last_login}'
I usually use single for keys e.g. foo[‘bar’] and double for strings but that’s just my preference 
You should check out [Shamir's Secret Sharing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing) if you are interested in expanding this into allowing you to perform decryption with x/y parts of the secret. 
The `attrs` library removes the boiler plate of writing `self.x = x`. Also, I feel like, for your application, `elapsed_time` makes more sense as a property.

One thing that Perl gets right is the `q` operator. It doesn't work here, because we don't require dollar signs in front of variables. In perl, `q` indicates a quote coming up. The next character is the quoting symbol, and the string continues until the next instance of the quoting symbol. `q!This """is a'''' string' with "quotes inside it without needing escaping, and it's possible because I picked my own quoting character, the exclamation mark.!` That is not valid Python, but it's pretty genius. Congrats, Perl. Python's could be something like $. `ru$@this is a string with raw and unicode before it @`
I think that if I was writing a library, then I'd probably raise the error inside the library and then the user of the library would need to catch it. However, if I'm writing code for myself, then I think that having the errors in the same scope is clearer than having errors "hidden" into some methods in classes. If the errors occur in the same place, then it's easier to interpret what causes the error.
I don't really see the utility of this, since applying to passphrases is equivalent in security to applying a single one with the two concatenated. Still, here's a quick review: 26: always use with statement. You can either put both in the same line, or the second inside. `with open(f1, 'wb') as write_fp, open(f2, 'rb') as read_fp:` 28: I think it's cleaner to just throw an assert error, since this is a pretty rare edge case that shouldn't happen `assert os.stat(f1).st_size &gt; 0, "The file is empty"` 33: The extra else indent isn't necessary, Just early return in the except block. 92: Is that relaly the right way? Does args.decrypt not work? Also, never use an "is" check with True, even if it does work. Also, you don't even need to compare it to true at all anyway, simply `if args.decrypt:` You can even go: func = img_decrypt if vars.decrypt else img_encrypt func(args.file, args.first_password, args.second_password) Your docstrings are so short and obvious that I personally don't see the point other than just having them there for the sake of having docstrings. Imo, these kinds of comments don't really add anything. 
Typed this on mobile but it should get you close to what you want. There isn't any error checking or handling. with open('file_containing_numbers', 'r') as fd: list_of_lists = [ line.split() for line in fd.read().splitlines() ] for line in list_of_lists: print (sum(int(x) for x in line), end=' ') for line in list_of_lists: print (unichr(sum(int(x) for x in line)), end=' ')
Maybe out topic but https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pydie/
Basically. Exceptions are a powerful control flow tool, but easy to abuse. Manage with them as early as possible, unless you want the caller from the enclosing scope(s) to be alerted, and able to decide what to do with them. Some exceptions are obvious and can be handled in their own scope, others might be complicated, and require different management in different situations, and some shouldn't be caught at all, and exit the program.
I see. Perfect. Little question... I have a trouble when I tried to do a list comprehension in lines 46 to 49. I do `joined_encrypted_bytes = [a, b for a, b in zip(cipher_even_bytes, cipher_odd_bytes)]`, but I get `SyntaxError` when I tried to run the program. I tried with `joined_encrypted_bytes = [[a, b] for a, b in zip(cipher_even_bytes, cipher_odd_bytes)]` and `joined_encrypted_bytes = [a for a, b in zip(cipher_even_bytes, cipher_odd_bytes)]` but that gen a tuple and a list respectively and I can't pass them to a bytes in file writes... Maybe list comprehension may don't be possible in this case? 
Thanks. I will check it latter. 
Whenever you get an error like this it is always helpful to check the previous line. If you forgot the ":" to open an indent or a ")","}", or "]" it will most likely say the next line is the error instead of realizing something was omitted in the line before.
Shamirs secret sharing isn't for encryption. They would want [threshold encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_cryptosystem?wprov=sfla1)
You're correct, I guess line 69 can't be avoided. joined_encrypted_bytes = [] [joined_encrypted_bytes.extend([i,j]) for i,j in zip(a,b)]
Yes and so is Jupyter. 
Blender is NOT a good platform for programming (and Ton Roosendaal has said it's not designed as such). If it was, when you changed from monkeys to cylinders, the monkeys would have been deleted. Been there, done that. 
Skiena's Algorithm Design is great, I find CLRS and K&amp;T a tad too formal for interviewing (but excellent for study).
Thanks, I've completed about 20% of a code academy course so far now!
Looks useful! I like the way this library is documented, very well explained.
I'm okay with single quotes for things like foo['bar'], but always use double quotes for defining strings. Apostrophes are more common than quotes in strings, and I prefer to have them be consistently double quoted.
In this state, this don't have really utility as you say. Maybe if I improve this, it can be of utility (like implement Shamir's Secret Sharing, of which I had no knowledge since today). I wrote this because I can and was a suddenly idea that come to my brain. &gt; 26: always use with statement. You can either put both in the same line, or the second inside. Yes. I will change this. Thanks. &gt; 28: I think it's cleaner to just throw an assert error, since this is a pretty rare edge case that shouldn't happen I just be explicit and descriptive; like PEP 20 say: `Explicit is better tan implicit.` &gt; 33: The extra else indent isn't necessary, Just early return in the except block. If I don't indent `IdentationError` appear. &gt; 92: Is that relaly the right way? Does args.decrypt not work? Also, never use an "is" check with True, even if it does work. Also, you don't even need to compare it to true at all anyway, simply if args.decrypt I wrote it that way because be the first method that I can make to work. I used `is` check because `pylint` say: &gt; Comparison to True should be just 'expr' or 'expr is True' (singleton-comparison) So, I think to use `is` with True is OK. Thanks, I will rewrite docstrings
Strings and Symbols are different in Ruby (especially when it comes to accessing hashes, and single or double quotes can have very different behaviours. I can't speak for JS, but I write a lot of Ruby.
Any support for asyncio?
Then you can just use a normal text editor or a more simple IDE. I use sublime text for python and it’s great.
Thanks. I had no knowledge about on thoses algorithms.
You're right - I oversimplified it in my comment. "It is a form of secret sharing, where a secret is divided into parts, giving each participant its own unique part, where some of the parts or all of them are needed in order to reconstruct the secret." You can use any encryption algorithm to encrypt the data and then use SSS to distribute the encryption key between y parties while also specifying that a minimum of x/y parts are required to reconstruct the secret (the encryption key). Threshold encryption is also really cool! 
Never bothered me. But, with a decent IDE the self should appear different, which might make it more readable for you? What are you using to code?
What are you replying to?
I use ' for utilities, like email addresses and information the user won't see. And " for stuff the user will see.
My personal convention is double quotes for actual strings (stuff that a user might see or that might be manipulated), single quotes for stuff that are basically named constants. It's not a perfect rule, but it's what I like.
Interestingly enough, I'm in the same exact situation you are! I'm still pretty new to this as well, so I'm sure there's a better way. But I had this problem a month ago or so. I believe the solution is a while loop with the next as the condition. next = True While next: .. Do something .. Next = url When the next field is empty, the loop will stop. Stack exchange taught me this trick ;) 
PyCharm is excellent. I spent some days trying to make Atom as good as PyCharm, and it's very good right now but still not nearly as polished.
A few notes: * On reddit, lines that start with four spaces are treated as code: // this is a code comment * In Python, the default array-like type is the [list](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#sequence-types-list-tuple-range) * You can simply use the `input()` function to read a line of input then use the `split()` function to separate that input. * You can use a for loop to iterate over a list directly: for some_number in a_list_of_numbers: do_something_with(some_number) * [List comprehensions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) are your friend * In your last line, you have a syntax error. When you write a for loop, you define a new variable after the `for` and before the `in`. You can't index into the array in that manner. See list comprehensions for some ideas to do a similar thing. This code doesn't do exactly what you specified, but you could easily modify it if you really want them to enter the numbers one at a time and/or strictly limit them to entering `n-1` numbers: print("How many numbers?") n = int(input().strip()) + 1 print("Enter the numbers, separated by spaces:") submitted = [int(i) for i in input().strip().split()] missing = [str(i) for i in range(1, n) if i not in submitted] print("Missing: " + " ".join(missing)) 
Don't use the second, as everybody else uses "self". It makes your code very different to all the other Python out there. You'll get used to it.
Your single quoted dictionary key is a string.
Cheers for the reply! I'll give your solution a go. Slowly but surely getting more confident but having a senior around would be helpful for these things

This needs a lot more upvotes. CLRS is great if you want a mathematically rigorous and really thorough treatment of the subject. It's kind of terrible if what you want is a good intuitive grasp of algorithms, and how and when to use them. Skiena, by contrast, may skip a lot of the rigor, but it gets at the core intuition and understanding *much* better than CLRS, and far more quickly. Sure, if you slog your way through CLRS, and make sure you understand everything at each step, by the end you'll have a *very* good understanding of algorithms. But it will take a 3-4x as long as going through Skiena. Actually, I suspect that if you really want to get through CLRS, starting with Skiena might be a great way to speed the whole process up. The intuition gained from Skiena will make CLRS go so much faster that I think you'll come out ahead in the end. 
Sure enough. print ('Thanks')
Modifying your IDE (like PyCharm) to change the way quoted text will remedy the optics problem. 
Some charts produced with matplotlib and whatnot (just not stored as jpegs) have all the data in machine readable formats, super easy to pull out, but your examples are jpegs so it's much more involved.
Here's a version that is closer to your original code: import sys n = int(sys.argv[1]) # Make an array of length n containing False in each position # [False, False, ...] submitted = [False for _ in range(n)] # Ask the user for n-1 numbers and set the appropriate index to True for i in range(n - 1): print("Enter a number: ") x = int(input().strip()) submitted[x - 1] = True # Make a list of the missing numbers missing = [str(i + 1) for i, s in enumerate(submitted) if not s] ''' # Equivalent to: missing = [] for index, value in enumerate(submitted): if value == False: missing.append(str(index + 1)) ''' print("Missing: " + " ".join(missing))
I think ' is preferred, but I follow a similar pattern to you. I do so much C outside of Python that I tend to use " instinctively. I even sometimes do ' for single characters by analogy with C. Most languages other than Python have " for strings. Only others that tend to make this distinction are scripting languages that specify differences between literal strings and string which support substitution.
That, and one can't rely on vertices order either. I tried to write a script making a mesh just noting down the commands a user issues and putting them in a script, and it turned out at some point that I couldn't be sure that e.g. 100 and 101 are where I expect them to be.

BTW, this should go into www.reddit.com/r/learnpython, which is the place to ask programming related questions...
Wait--is this a self loathing post? On a serious note--I agree with a lot of the other comments--including "self" makes things clear. I'd almost say using `def _update(_)` is worse than using some random character like `def _update(S)` because the underscore already has a couple of different uses. A simple, if potentially unrealistic and convoluted example: class Zed(object): def __init__(_): _._items = [(1, "One"), (2, "Two"), (3, "Three")] _._stuff =[10, 11, 12, 13, 14] def get_em(_): for n, _ in _._items: print(_._stuff[n]) if __name__ == "__main__": z = Zed() z.get_em() 
Prior work (at least the ones I know): [jdupes](https://github.com/jbruchon/jdupes), [fdupes](https://github.com/adrianlopezroche/fdupes), [hardlink](https://jak-linux.org/projects/hardlink/), [rdfind](https://rdfind.pauldreik.se/). At least one other tool I no longer remember the name. Probably also tens of variations of shell scripts with `find … -exec md5sum`. If you check file sizes and inode numbers, you're already doing quite well—these are good ideas in general to check before going for actually reading the file. You can look up other techniques used by these tools and maybe try making use of them too.
I add `this.` everywhere when I write Java, because it makes clear that I'm referring to instance variables or methods. When somebody else reads my code (or myself after some time) he doesn't need to guess where the variable is defined. I don't find any readability issues, it's just matter of habit.
Self sucks and underscore too. However you can use any other utf8 symbol for name. I use self for ease of open source understandability however internally i use some Chinese symbol or one of emojis like shit. 
Thanks. No idea how to get spyder to work though?
The assertion error is explicit, especially if you put the message in. For indentation, I meant getting rid of the else block, and having a return inside the except block. The is check, you basically cheated pylint, it was giving you that error because you never do comparisons to true.
I hate to return fake results. It creates a lot of extra code because now you need to recheck every function that may error out. Better to just throw an custom error message. Now for pretty GUIs that don't handle tracebacks well, I do it the nasty way (with an is_gui flag), but it's a mess.
I usually add dependencies if they are important for the project. If I need to do just one http request or some simple xml parsing, I use what's avaiable in the standard library. To do some serious web or xml work then Requests and BeautifulSoup are welcome. Also, if there's something I need that I can get writing 20 lines of Python in 3 minutes, I prefer spend these 3 minutes instead of increasing the dependencies count even if there's a module that does exactly the same thing.
Definitely want to use: if args.decrypt: and not: if args.decrypt is True
I feel the same way.. There are some amazing programmers in other teams (my company is a data company), but my project is such low priority and the other teams are so busy its difficult to get any help. Let me know if you get it to work. I can find the exact code I use if you can't get it to work correctly. 
You should not be taking passwords as arguments on command line. If you call this and type passwords in anyone watching from your machine can get the passwords in plain text. ps aux | grep BiCrypt krrl 3962 0.0 0.0 46412 13636 pts/18 S+ 12:27 0:00 python BiCrypt.py k.txt 123 123 
Good review. Maybe via `input()` should be better?
No, but it makes you a pro at the box and if the box is well designed, you steal ideas on how to structure your code to work well with that box. Numpy for example is very fast if you use it right. So how do you use it right across 200k lines of code? Well, now you're probably an expert because you wrote 200k lines of code that had to work together.
If this is a "only for practice" type project than great! But be well aware that there are existing tools for this purpose that have been audited by experts and only those should be used for any serious purposes.
This is good advice. I'd also add that having error return values just duplicates the effort everywhere you call the method. If you want to throw three or four types of exceptions, or add useful messages to your exceptions, or really accomplish anything beyond a simple "success: false", you introduce lots of complexity and increase the risk of making a mistake. Plus, if you're using a tool to collect errors, your stack traces lose a ton of value. By throwing exceptions at the source, you can see the locals and arguments of the call stack in your logs. By throwing exceptions in the caller, you're destroying your ability to dig into these problems. 
 while True: data = read json ... if not data['next']: break please consider r/learnpython and read up on basic control flows.
Yes I know that I don't need to reinvent the wheel. Less in this kind of things. In a future, I wan't to implement Shamir's Secret Sharing or thresh hold encryption for serious purposes.
I'm working on this: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/77vkgi/packaging_an_conda_environment/ Kinda stuck though :/
Thanks. I will took some of you recommendations.
No shit, Sherlock? It's not a string being declared and stored though. It's a temporary, single-word key.
The "self" object has to be referenced so that the program manipulates the correct variables. It has to be explicit because Python syntax is explicit. Is "self" a good name for the current object? I think it is.
Since Python accesses local variables much more efficiently than instance attributes, all attributes referenced more than once in a method, I make locals of them by placing a series of `x = self.x` statements at the top of the method. You can just ignore these when reading it, most of the `self` uses are eliminated, and the code runs faster. 
Trying not to jump out a window understanding RE and getting it to work properly...
Yes, you should post it. It wouldn't harm anything, increases your portfolio and can help someone/a lot of people.
Not using "self" would break a lot of tools. Is it worth it? I say most emphatically "No"!!!
Or if you still do 2.7 Print “thanks”
I’m the opposite. I prefer double quote since I deal with a lot of JSON objects, in python or cli. Writing everything in double quote helps eliminating conversion issue when it’s not in a dictionary form 
meh, its not really about python. Its about DNA.

You can actually use -p with most conda commands and point it at a custom directory instead of a specific env name. That might help you out some. There's also some other projects from anaconda that can help with this, I think kapsel and they had a relatively new one recently whose name escapes me. 
I'd say that if your team is already familiar with requests + BS4, it might be better because your team is already familiar with it, and anyone coming in to the project will only have to familiarise with one of the options, as opposed to both. Anyhow, you should be working with virual environments in which case dependencies shouldn't really be an issue. Especially if it's a fully separated project.
https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Python-Specific-Software-Development/dp/0134034287 One of my favorite books
i'll check it out!
Yeah, it's just you.
Really sorry, I have 0 experience with setting it up or troubleshooting on windows. 
that's what snippets are for, honestly. Get one, learn it, and set "s." to expand to "self." and suddenly the typing issue is gone. As for "readability" using WORDS over symbols is much, much more readable. 
Python is an amazing language for doing every kind of programming. If you are enthusiastic to learn python then read following books: 1.@Learning to Program Using Python [PDF] (http://www.onlineprogrammingbooks.com/learning-program-using-python/) 2.@Dive Into Python 3 (http://www.onlineprogrammingbooks.com/free-book-dive-into-python-3) 3. Python cookbook (https://www.ebooks-it.net/ebook/python-cookbook-3rd-edition/) These all books are best books available for learning python to advanced level for all kind of stuffs .First book "Learning To Program Using Python" is best beginner book to start with.It teaches everything you need to start programming with python .I read it and loved its content. Next two books teach you everything about what stuffs you can do in python an advanced level.Everything a python programmer knows is in there. Besides these Python course at Codecademy @Python (https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python) is also amazing and one of the best free course available to start from scratch.You will definitely love this site and all of its courses. So, go give these a try, you will definitely love Python. And Harness the Power of Python. But do you think, by online material available, you can learn all concepts of language? if yes, then unfortunately you are wrong. You cannot grasp deep concepts unless you discuss with some expert. When you study under a mentor, only then you can understand an practice well. So attending a programming school than online learning is always proffered. And Holberton school (https://www.holbertonschool.com) provides the same environment and opportunities so that you can learn well.
I feel like shortening self.something to st is unPythonic. Unless that was common, to start each method with shortening each self.variable reference to a local variable, always, then I don't find that to be an acceptable solution to this quirk of Python. Practicing a commonly used and well understood methodology is important to good coding practices.
https://docs.python.org/3/library/getpass.html :)
I'd be interested in seeing it. I recently wrote a similar script that just checked hashs. I'd like to see some "tips and tricks" on speeding it up.
Perfect! just that I need.
You probably want r/learnpython. And when you go there, don't post a pic of your code; makes it hard on people who would otherwise copy and paste to run it and help you out. Post the code itself, either in your posting or someplace like pastebin.
What, specifically, is your question? That will help us help you.
my question is what do I need to add to the code to get it to do what I need it to do. I have a very broad understanding of python and have not the slightest clue how to add what I need.
I used to teach Python to kids 9 to 19, can recommend :D
It sounds like you'd want to just encrypt the file with AES or whatever (or Fernet to make it easy), then use Shamir's on the key.
&gt; _ that is often used in loops, tuple matching ... and in gettetxt contexts (e.g. django) to mark a translatable string: `_('BlaBla')`
Yeah, that's what I thought: any self-respecting IDE should be able to template out this sort of minor annoyance. Personally I hate people who omit `this.` in Java, I'd rather not have to deal with the same issue in Python too. Your text editors are very powerful, people! Just learn how to use them.
Allow me to offer some constructive comments on your cryptography. First of all, good on you for not using AES-ECB! I can't say I was wise enough to use a different mode for my first crypto project. However, AES-CTR has its own vulnerabilities in your implementation. [Pop over to stackoverflow for a complete explanation.](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/33846/is-regular-ctr-mode-vulnerable-to-any-attacks) The gist of it is that you'll want to generate a MAC after encryption, then use that MAC to verify authenticity and data integrity PRIOR to decryption. Otherwise you're opening the door to some attacks. Alternately, you could use an [authenticated encryption](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption) mode like AES-GCM, which is supported natively within the [pyca/cryptography library](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/aead/#cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead.AESGCM). As a general rule of thumb, always try to use AES-GCM for new implementations. It's the current hotness. 
I usually use singles around single characters and keys. Stuff the end user wont see. Double quotes are used for longer strings and display stuff. I might make exceptions if I want to use internal quotes, but again, I follow that general rule. char_value = ord('A') print("the value of the character 'A' is {}".format(char_value)) 
The book Algorithms is the way to go. 
I think "my" is better : first person versus third person.
In c++ you'll have convention for that, for example: m_varname for instance variable for class methods I use 'this' notation. On the contrary I don't think the self notation is bad, but it does make you write more boilerplate code.
What's the point of this, exactly? Like someone else in this thread said, this provides equivalent security or worse to encrypting the whole thing with a single concatenated password
Exactly this! For added security, if the secret holders have public-private keypairs, you could encrypt their share of the secret with their public key before sending or transferring it to them. 
So first off, I heartily recommend /r/learnpython. Great community there. But off the top of my head, read in each line. If no !, convert it to an int and save it. If there’s a !, get the number before it, int it, and then factorialize it. 
thanks and yea i will check that out
Learning project. It doesn't really have to have a point beyond getting practise with the language and building confidence.
I'm going to preface by saying that I'm not able to grasp a few of the details of your problem due to the grammatical structure of your explanation. That being said, I might be able to help. For tasks that demand concurrency, you simply can't beat the power and efficiency of [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html). If you need true parallel processing with an application leveraging asyncio, you can use asyncio's [run_in_executor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.AbstractEventLoop.run_in_executor) function paired with a [ThreadPoolExecutor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor). If you're looking to leverage all of the cores on a multicore CPU during your concurrent operations, just use a [ProcessPoolExecutor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor), which will run your operations within their own, separate python interpreter process. Just be aware that it can be a bit resource intensive to do this. 
This is perfect for porn with your gf. Tell her it can only be unlocked with two passwords. Little does she know you are running a keylogger in the bg.
&gt; with the underscore being enough to indicate the current class It doesn't indicate the current class. It indicates the current object. &gt; Variable names shouldn't be too short or their meaning isn't obvious They should be long enough to convey their meaning given the context surrounding them. You don't need `math.math_log` for instance to differentiate from `logging.logging_log` because the context is already given in the package name.
Experience and test my self. Maybe it can be useful in future.
I like you... point of view xD
Eh, problem with Skiena is his examples and implementations are in C and he also gives some unorthodox approaches to problems. Reading his code as a beginner will sometimes lead you to the wrong direction
Thanks for your reply, i am really sorry for my awful English. what i am trying to accomplish is to create a perfect parallelism on the first stage of the application, i.e each process will have it's own data and there will be no communications between processes. then each process internally will perform a parallel k-means clustering on the data. to do the parallel k-means each process will create it's own sub-processes and these sub-processes should communicate using collective communications(broadcast and gather). 
I'm about half way through Fluent Python. It's lead to several "ah ha!" moments.
Thats the first section the last two sections are python biopython.
He's just say he uses single quotes when it would be a symbol in ruby. Not that they are the same thing though.
Really thanks for the sources. I actually now that ECB mode is borken, but I don't have in concern the vulnerabilities of CTR mode. I will detail the explanation. A question: MAC is equal to HMAC? Because I only found HMAC for Python. In the case of HMAC is that I need, what is the best way to generate the key and then compare the digest? Related to https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/hmac.html
Why not learn Swift and get an app in the App Store here's a free coupon... https://www.udemy.com/learn-swift-quick/?couponCode=FREESWIFTCOURSE if you want to thank me leave positive review for the biopython course.
Very cool stuff, how well does this play with numpy and does it require string data? 
Just so everyone coming here knows, this is NOT the same as what TrueCrypt et al. does. This simply concatenates 2 different encrypted data.
Yes, is very simple. I don't believe that this generate confusion in what is the function of my little project.
SendGrid has added a bunch of issues for hacktoberfest with the labels "up for grabs" and "good first pr". They keep posting more each day, too. 
Yes, using an HMAC will do the trick for you. HMAC stands for "hash-based message authentication code," and can provide you with a means of validating authenticity and data integrity if it's implemented properly. In the case of your application, I'd concatenate your passwords prior to encryption key derivation and use that to key the HMAC. Then encrypt your data and run it through the keyed HMAC function in order to generate the MAC. You can then prepend that to the ciphertext for later verification. For decryption, the library you linked provides a compare_digests function that should work well enough for your use case. First, separate your stored MAC from the ciphertext. Then key your HMAC function with the concatenated plaintext passwords and compute a new digest of the ciphertext. Compare the freshly calculated MAC with the stored MAC using the compare_digests function, and refuse to decrypt the data if there's a mismatch. That should give you adequate protection against any of the attacks on CTR mode that rely on manipulating data integrity, as well as validating that the last person to manipulate the data had a valid password. In addition, it serves as a way of verifying your user entered the correct password before trying to decrypt the data. Which is always a nice feature. 
Any particular reason for using conda? What is conda giving you that you don't already have with virtualenv/pip?
Really thanks. Your comments are really useful. I already have in mind to verify if user entered the correct password, but I did not have to clear how to implement that.
Now I understand what you're trying to accomplish. During the first stage, how do you create the separate processes? Is there a separate parent process that invokes those processes? During the second stage, how are you planning to handle IPC? Named pipes, sockets, or something different? Using asyncio means that you'll have to do a bit more work upfront in order to fit the application to the architecture described here. The payoff for that initial extra work is, of course, more granular control over the execution pattern of and responses returned by the subprocesses. Is there any particular benefit gained using this pattern, versus simply having the subprocesses return the processed data and performing aggregation within the parent process? It's easy enough to return a custom object filled with your processed data through an asyncio future, using the run_in_executor and asyncio.wait functions. That simple design consideration could be the difference between 30 hours of development time and 30 minutes of development time. This is certainly an interesting design pattern, thank you for making me aware of it! 
Always happy to help when it comes to cryptography! 🙂 It can be an extremely complex topic, but you can get the hang of it with enough practice. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions on the particulars of your HMAC implementation, I'd be glad to provide advice if you need it. 
So im the DevOps guy, and the dev who built it is using Anaconda for AI packages like Spacy which is an NLP package among others. They can be installed with pip, but Anaconda is better at dealing with both environments and AI libraries. 
Found the Perl guy
Don't reply to these, just redirect to learnpython.
Opened the link to check out the PRNG, found a true quantum RNG. Was not disappointed. 
If one has done any dabbling in cryptography, this is the first thing that would come to mind :) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability#Use_in_cryptography
thanks, here is an example, if there are 1000 person's Gps data with large amount of trajectories , the application has to perform **clustering** operation on each individual's data however each individual's data is processed independently so every person's data can be processed concurrently and this is the first level parallelization. since the **clustering** step takes too much time i need a way to implement a parallel k-means clustering so that i can reduce the completion time. if you use multiprocessing pool, pool.map(function_to_run_in_parallel, input[]) this will invoke concurrent processes and you can also set the number of concurrent processes but the problem is pool doesn't have multicast and scatter features. Mpi4py is good for IPC because it has scatter, broadcast and gather functions but the problem is you can not modify the number of processes. The main benefit of this pattern is computation time , the sequential program takes hours to finish. 
Is there any good reason for splitting into odd/even bytes and applying one encryption pass to each? It seems like `encrypt(encrypt(data, key1), key2)` would probably work just as well, and avoid the messy splitting and zipping. Also much more secure, since if you have only one of the keys, with the current approach you get 50% of the content, and low entropy content like text or uncompressed images this would leak an awful lot of useful info. Have you tested it with large (say, 1-10GB) inputs? It looks like you're reading everything into memory and probably making a few copies as you go. Reading &amp; processing chunk by chunk instead while True: buf = fh.read(4096) do_stuff(buf) if len(buf) &lt; 4096: break Or similar, will much reduce that memory requirement. You should maybe consider using a proper [Key Derivation Function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html#key-derivation) instead of your `sha256(password)`. Why bother with the `assert(os.stat(....))` call/exception handling? You'll just get an empty string from the `read()` call if it exists, and the `open(f1)` call should already have failed if it doesn't exist. Your `decrypt()` function generates the output filename by stripping the last 6 chars off the input name (assuming it ends in `.crypt`, but what if it doesn't? Either have a required argument for output filename, or maybe cehck if the target filename already exists, and warn/abort if so. Lastly, there's a decent amount of repetition/redundancy in the code (turning a key into sha256 bytes, splitting/unsplitting the content buffers, etc) that could be reasonably extracted into functions.
Don't reply, just redirect to learnpython.
I don't believe that'd work, since `update()` doesn't return the underlying object. But, the constructor can optionally just take some data, so `hashlib.sha256('this is a test').digest()` should work fine. 
I like when languages have explicit member access, but I dislike how self. can bloat the size of the line. Can easily add 15 or 20 characters. I really like the ruby method of prefixing with @ or @@, it's both clear and concise. 
Not true. I have seen devs claiming + ten years of experience, which turned out to be 1 year repeated 9 times. 200k doesn't translate to experience, specially if its 200k of shitty code. That can be easily found in web dev. 
No, lets please not make python like perl...
&gt; skip the full hash if the mod time and file size and first 8k and last 8k match I wouldn't do that, it's a very clear path to data loss. If you're actually deleting based on duplicate files, you really want to be sure those files are duplicates. Just because the first and last 8k of a file match doesn't mean the rest will, and if a whole set of mostly similar data files were in use at the same time they can have the same mod time. It might be safe to do within some (most) specific file types, but overall that's not something I'd consider worth the risk.
Consider using dask, especially dask-learn: http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2017/02/07/dask-sklearn-simple It is designed to solve problems like yours in a scalable but simple manner. See this post and maybe others on his blog. http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2015/06/26/Complex-Graphs
The other answer covered it. It is important also to note that the builtin function `reversed` does basically the same thing and should be used in real code instead of your custom implementation. 
Hmm - not sure that would work for any of the frontend UI parts - backend certainly and do plenty of that. Also sorry you're getting downvoted! Every post seems to go to zero around here.
Okay, it looks like this is completely possible using mpi4py! I'll outline a design that should meet your execution requirements and allow you to implement a parallel k-means clustering algorithm in the second stage of execution. The implementation I have in mind uses an asyncio ProcessPoolExecutor for the first stage of parallelization, and mpi4py in the second stage. Keep in mind that it's possible to use any arbitrary parallelization technique to achieve the first stage of parallelization. This design calls for 2 separate scripts. I will refer to them as the "master" and the "worker." The master script will contain a class (or set of classes) that will need to be instantiated with the GPS data for one single person. This class will be responsible for managing the invocation of the worker processes, the orchestration of your k-means clustering algorithm across those worker processes, and will contain the output of your k-means clustering algorithm once it has finished execution. It needs to have a single "run" method that handles the execution of the k-means clustering algorithm from start to finish, and either returns the resultant data or "self," if the object contains the data within a public variable. The worker script will contain the logic required to perform the computationally intensive operations utilized within your k-means clustering algorithm. It will also contain logic to receive data from the master process, in addition to logic needed to interpret the orchestration commands received from the master process. When executed, the master script will create an instance of ProcessPoolExecutor. It will then N separate instances of the orchestration class, each containing the GPS data for exactly 1 person. It will wrap the "run" method in a future object returned by event_loop.run_in_executor(executor, object.run). You can then use asyncio.gather() to wait until all of the processes have finished and return their output, or you can use asyncio.wait with various keyword arguments to continually poll for the results of completed processes. When the method wrapped by the future is executed within the ProcessPoolExecutor, it will call **MPI.COMM_X.Spawn(sys.executable, args=["worker.py"], maxprocs=I)**, where i is the maximum number of processes you want to devote to your k-means clustering algorithm. From there, you can use the various MPI IPC functions to communicate with your worker processes and orchestrate the execution of your k-means clustering algorithm by utilizing the object returned by the spawn call. At this point, the worker processes will be performing the computationally intensive tasks needed by your k-means clustering algorithm across *i* processes, as directed by instructions received from the orchestration class. Since MPI provides duplex IPC communication, the orchestration will be able to aggregate the data as the processing completes. It can then return the data to the master process once the k-means clustering algorithm has finished running. You can see the barebones requirements of the orchestration class and the worker script [buried in the mpi4py documentation](http://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html#dynamic-process-management). It will probably take you less time to code this solution than it did for me to type this out. 😅 Keep in mind that, in this design, there are still ways to squeeze out better performance. Under the hood, there are a lot of calls to Python's Pickle library in order to pass data around, which will cause some overhead. You could theoretically implement a method of passing data between processes using memory mapped files or something similar on top of MPI. You can also spread the worker processes across multiple computers thanks to the glory of MPI, which could provide a huge performance boost for your k-means clustering algorithm. That's a topic for a different day, though. 
An M3U is just a plaintext file with a list of files, usually music, to play. It can point to a file or a network/web location. It shouldn't be hard to programmatically generate one, just put one file/URL per line, using # to comment. That said, I've never used them with videos which is why there might be some differences.
You mean you want to shade each region on a single graph a color? If so you can do something like [this](https://plot.ly/python/shapes/#highlighting-time-series-regions-with-rectangle-shapes). 
Intentions are good, but probably want to work on grammar before writing English articles.
As I said several times there is not a good reason for do this... I wrote this because I *can* and was a idea that come suddenly to my mind. This is my first learning project and I only want advices, reviews and corrections. I don't pretend to reinvent the wheel and I know that exist other betters, so betters methods to do this. IMO, I don't think that commentaries like: "There is a god reason for this...", "This don't have utility...", "This is no necessary", "We don't need this..." are good comments when the author of the project specify that is a learning project or similar. All peoples have differents approach and needs. "The garbage of some is the gold of others". In other hand, really thanks for you recommendations. I'll keep it in mind.
Let's recognize good ideas and steal them. Not everything in Perl is awful. Arbitrary quoting symbols is a good idea. It came from Unix `sed`.
All you did was change the variable name, youve always been able to do this. 'self' is just the convention for consistent readability across modules. &gt; in C++ you can omit...most of the time explicit &gt; implicit, it's the python way.
My post started out much smaller and I was not expecting to get as highly upvoted as it did
Nothing to be ashamed of ! It's easier to forage for resources compared to actually go through and learn from them :)
Well if you're lying then yes
I didn't mean to come off as dismissive, and I understand the purpose as a learning exercise. The problem isn't you, it's the next idiot whose boss told him he needs a crypto tool that requires 2 passwords, and finds your code on github and uses it for his creditcard database. And it doesn't matter what you put in your readme, because the sort of person that would use it is not the person who reads warnings in readmes :) Doing anything related to crypto often leads to these sorts of comments because it is such a big problem in the industry. If you had created the exact same code that just took the input file and split into 2 output files, one with odd bytes and other with even, and then recombined them, I think there would be no problem, but as soon as crypto happens, everyone has an opinion, and mostly it's that "You're Doing It Wrong!!!!". On the other hand, you might not have got so many comments otherwise, and at least some of them are useful, so if you don't take it too personally and ignore the dumb ones, maybe you come out on top? :) 
Kivy, or write a wrapper for PointerPressed, possibly?
Yeah. I last thought about OpenCV in Python when I’d heard there really wasn’t a good pip installer via Talk Python to Me. IIRC, the guy who wrote some OpenCV wrapper code pretty much said, “yeah, go build OpenCV manually. That’s your only move.”
Tab in your functions. Looks like that's your main issue. 
`_` already has a defined meaning in common usage. Maybe you can shorten `self` to `me` instead? It would also still make sense when read.
I started learn programming this year like a goal. And today, here, is my first piece of code; ugly, with errors and whatever it had. I will improve my code because I like my creation. I don't care if this don't have sense or is not necessary. Maybe in the future would be useful for the people, maybe no. I just love programming because is funny and entertaining. And like me, there are many more peoples. This is not personal to you... Just is frustrating that 50 ~ 60% of the commentaries had that type of marginal notes. And not only in this post... I appreciated all constructives comments that help me to grow, includin yours. Thanks againd and for your words.
I'm not sure this a good idea. Also you could have just used triple quotes, and then you can freely type double and single quotes.
befire I start, the script name should be lowercase according to pep8 \#1: I'd move the license to an external file \#15 This belongs in the readme \#17-18: multiple issues here. names of functions are usually verbs, so normally i'd say encrypt_img instead of img_decrypt, but the doc block says it encrypts a file instead of an image. so you should change the name of the function to match what you mean and get rid of the explanation in the doc block since the function is now descriptive. the parameter names should be meaningful. you use `f` twice where it means both `filename` and `first`. that's confusing. you aren't really gaining anything by avoiding a few keystrokes. also, it's considered good practice to have modifiers of variable names at the end. This is getting long. in short, i would change the function signature to: def encrypt_image(file_name: str, password1: str, password2: str): you're using python 3.6 so you might as well use type hints. Also, i'd update the doc block to include the parameters \#25-26: you can do a compound open like this: with open(...) as file1, with open(...) as file2: \#31: if you assert something, you should let it fail if it doesn't fails the assertion, alternatively issue a warning: if os.stat(f1).st_size &gt; 0: warnings.warn('The file is empty') key = sha256() if has less code, is less confusing, and you drop down an indentation level \#33-44: there's a good bit of code duplication here. i'd extract that logic into a function called `encrypt_bytes` \#52-73: everything I said above applies here as well \#72 not sure what you're doing here with the file name. Im guessing you're trying to strip the ".crypt" extension, but you don't have guarantee the file will contain that extension. so you are just arbitrarily truncating the file name, meaning it's possible to get an empty string. Bonus: Your two functions are almost the same. You might consider either creating a class instead of two functions, or since it's just a cli tool, maybe use closures to preconfigure a function (i.e. pass in the output filename and call it that way
&gt; import stdarray ?

I'm working on a Flask-AppBuilder app, but haven't needed Webpack yet. If I start doing custom React frontends, I'll give this a clone. Thanks!!
Thanks.. 
I use flask run with autoreload on file changes. Then I use the editor of my choice. 
Isn't it the other way around? If the first and last 8K do not match, it is not a duplicate and it will not delete. If they do match, it will hash the entire file.
It might also be an idea to write a "test" (using the term loosely) that benches it against `cmp` or `md5sum` or whtatever.
To be honest there's almost no information on the page, just gifs. 
beazley's python cookbook s really useful
No, despite what the other comments say, a lot of people don't like `self` spam. For your example, it seems fine though, as it is in most contexts. One place that I find it terrible and I had a hard time convincing people to write classes was code from numeric models. Imagine something like this but with longer names and several statements instead of one: &gt; self.s1 = (1/self.x1) * (-self.y0 + self.y1 * (1 - self.K1) * self.K2 + (self.ref - self.x0)) without `self`: &gt; s1 = (1/x1) * (-y0 + y1 * (1 - K1) * K2 + (ref - x0)) I actually went ahead and wrote a class decorator that applies a limited AST transformation for this scenario but never published it since it's a very niche thing. If anyone is interested in this, I can try to document it and share some other day. 
`my` reads better than `me`.
nope. No Perl since 2007 :) I read an article on configuring Python by using classes instead of config files and the author used `my` and I thought it read well... not that I use `my` in my code. I use `self`.
For me personally as a self-taught user of Node and developer of web apps, I've always struggled to learn webpack. So far I've strung together npm commands to use sass and JS compilers, browserify to bundle JS, but it feels like that last piece of the puzzle is missing yet. I can't figure out how to automate all of this in webpack. Obviously looked at your webpack files first and they seem pretty understandable so far. I guess the only thing I'm missing there is the relation between loaders and npm dependencies. I'd definitely like to see more comments in webpack files describing why they're doing something and not what they're doing.
Should be good enough for a D&amp;D game
There's a little bit text, just making things more interactive! 😊
I don't see a problem with this if you use`self.something` more than a couple of times. Why do you say it's not pythonic?
&gt; I've always struggled to learn webpack. Read [survivejs-webpack](https://survivejs.com/webpack/preface/) cover to cover (its a very easy read). My webpack is based exactly off that. Also check out [surviveJS-webpack chat](https://gitter.im/survivejs/webpack) if you get stuck or want to make recommendations to the text. Juho (the author) actively responds to everybody in that chat. He's excellent. &gt; I guess the only thing I'm missing there is the relation between loaders and npm dependencies. Loaders are npm packages that input a file then output a new file and seem to be specifically for webpack use. Webpack could set up its own "webpack dependency manager" to handle loaders and plugins but npm seems to be the route so far. &gt; I'd definitely like to see more comments in webpack files describing why they're doing something and not what they're doing. Read the book I recommended above, it will explain the *why*. I'm currently throwing comments everywhere since people seem to actually be interested in this now. Honestly, I don't know where to begin commenting the webpack stuff since the barrier of basic understanding is so high (which sucks).
I suppose I only feel like it's vaguely unPythonic. It makes someone reading code to have to keep track of many more variables. I suppose I was mentally overemphasizing this: &gt; There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. But these two are also important: &gt; Readability counts. &gt; Practicality beats purity. Maybe the practice is not bad, but consistency for an unorthodox readability practice is important, I think.
No problem!
This subreddit isn't really for promoting your own low quality blogs, it is for posting quality content. So at least take some of the constructive feedback - better english, more content.
what i said was “so you’re using single quoted strings in places you’d use symbols in JS and Ruby”
First of it is a well known optimisation technique when using a variable in an inner loop. It does fewer internal lookups. So it is certainly pythonic. Here is an example from some of my real code where i think it demonstrates the clarity well. def end_of_track(self): """ Writes the track to the buffer. &gt;&gt;&gt; from mxm.midifile.src.data_type_converters import readBew &gt;&gt;&gt; midi_out = MidiOutFile() &gt;&gt;&gt; midi_out.start_of_track() &gt;&gt;&gt; midi_out.note_on(channel=0, note=0x40, velocity=0x40) &gt;&gt;&gt; midi_out.end_of_track() &gt;&gt;&gt; r = list(midi_out.read_all()) &gt;&gt;&gt; r [77, 84, 114, 107, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 144, 64, 64, 0, 255, 47, 0] &gt;&gt;&gt; bytes(r[:4]), readBew(r[4:8]), r[8:12], r[12:16] (b'MTrk', 8, [0, 144, 64, 64], [0, 255, 47, 0]) """ raw = self.raw_out raw.writeSlice(c.TRACK_HEADER) # track_data = self._current_track_buffer.getvalue() track_data = self._current_track_buffer.read_all() eot_slice = bytes(writeVar(self.rel_time())) + bytes([c.META_EVENT, c.END_OF_TRACK, 0]) # wee need to know size of track data. track_length = len(track_data)+len(eot_slice) raw.writeBew(track_length, 4) # then write raw.writeSlice(track_data) raw.writeSlice(eot_slice) self._current_track_buffer.close() del self._current_track_buffer

How flask works in prod to absorb loads? I use to work a lot with twisted and on a simple pc several hundreds of connection in parallel is working fine. I am on a new web service with twisted, Klein, and treq, I wonder if it is still relevant
That is exactly what i was looking for ;), thank you fellow PyRedditor :) , you mentioned interesting stuffs , you are right on the communication overhead i'll try to exploit memory mapped IO if it's not very complex to implement. I will let you know my work progress in the coming few days. 
It looks simple and high level, i'll look into it ;). Thanks
You're not welcome on the internet. 
I haven't stress tested flask. It seems to be quite performant when paired with [celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/). There's also [Sanic](https://github.com/channelcat/sanic) which is on par with GO.
Perfect! so this will need a refactoring work. I already knew that my code looks weird because look a bit repetitive. Instead a class, (that surely is the possible best way) I could use decorators?
modules are loaded once per execution. i don't know any OOP programming language that do not have modules. patterns are solutions to recurring problems. the problem singleton solve does not exist in python. 
I didn't see any reference to a python code or any code at all. 
Since presumably you’ll only need to keep this running for a month or so, you could go with the dumbest, easiest option: run it inside a screen session, in a while loop with a sleep statement between each iteration. I’ve done this with scrapers on a free Google Cloud server and it works well enough that I didn’t bother to make it more complex. You can keep your dependencies isolated by installing them inside a python virtual environment. Here’s the pattern I use: virtualenv venv venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt venv/bin/python my_script.py Fir small one-offs like this I deploy by cloning a git repository directly, and update to the latest version by running “git pull”.
You shouldn't use the builtin server for production. You would deploy a flask application on any WSGI server, e.g. Gunicorn, Gevent, Twisted Web or Proxy Setups (with nginx). See http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/deploying/#self-hosted-options
My scheme is: twisted backend, vue.js + quasar frontend, celery for background task, the whole packaged in 3 options: - standalone for developers - single docker with s6 for simple deployment - multiple docker as template for professional-like deployment (ex: in kubernetes env) Does it look state of the art ?
&gt; just install python and pip and then all dependencies of the program on the server Sure, why not? Bonus points for using a Virtualenv. Bonus points for using Supervisord or Systemd. You could go crazy with configuration management and whatnot, but in your use-case, I don't see the point. The most important thing, IMO, is to have that code under some kind of version control. 
Which one is best, between gunicorn, gevent and twisted web? We have at work a bunch of gunicorn service, how does it behaves compared to twisted web or custom twisted app The issue with twisted is while it is wonderful and extremely efficient, it works poorly with sqlalchemy, kafka lib,... (poorly = requires thread). Wonder if this worth the trouble, if flask works great and all the burden of parrelism is put on WSGI layer
I am a recently converted Docker fan. I use to host all my stuff with Microsoft Azure using Web Apps, IaaS, App Services etc. I setup a Docker Swarm (2 nodes, don't need it but who does things in moderation?) a couple weeks ago and I'll never go back. I still have a few things hosted outside of Docker but all my small scripts and everything run inside a container. My swarm is just 2 of the cheaper Linux machines in Microsoft Azure. You'd be surprised how much you can host for basically free. There are even free options for hosting Docker containers that I've seen (not on Microsoft Azure). Disclaimer: I work for Microsoft. Not in the Azure group, but still a HUGE fan of it. Cloud services are an awesome thing. I also use AWS and Google cloud products personally.
To many people use regexps when a parser is so much more appropriate and maintainable.
* User virtual environments [pipenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) or [virturalenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) are super helpful * `pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt` will get you a list of your dependancies. (This should be done INSIDE a virtual environment that only has the dependancies for your script installed.) * Copy your script and requirements file from the Mac to CentOS server * Create new virtualenv on CentOS system (might have to to do some work getting pip and virtualenv going on CentOS depending on your version) * `pip install -r requirements.txt` * Run your script and it's deployed.
It's not a good idea. Do you even understand the founding concepts around Python as a language? https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/ Specifically... &gt; There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. and &gt; Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. 
&gt; Instead a class, (that surely is the possible best way) I could use decorators? using decorators would be a bit weird or rather convoluted. If you go the functional route, I would use closures to create a preconfigured function by passing deciphers.decrypt/cipher.encrypt, the output file name, and the input file name. then execute the preconfigured function by passing the passwords. now that i think about it, i guess you don't even need closures. you could just pass all 5 variables. if you go the OOP route, then you'd need a class with both the encrypt and decrypt methods, but that would technically be wasteful since you would never be calling both of the functions. it doesn't really matter though. just pick which technique you'd like to practice or even maybe do both and decide which you like better &gt; When I need to use if instead trywith assert? That confusing me since I read about that assertions are MEANT to throw an error when the assertion fails. putting them in a try/catch and letting them pass is counter productive and leads to uglier confusing code. here, you seem to not really care the file is empty since you proceed when that happens, meaning you're more interested in just warning the user. it makes more sense to use a function for its intended purpose than re-purposing another to do the same thing 
I would say to always use virtualenv. It's very easy to learn, use, and goes a long way in keeping your host system clean. 
+1 for supervisord, it and supervisorctl make managing long running python stuff a breeze
Thanks, this is exactly what I've done!

I'm an old dinosaur, and JavaScript-land doesn't make sense to me anymore. 
I just did this recently with matplotlib, using http://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/ginput_manual_clabel.html as a guide. Display the image with 'imshow' and then use 'ginput' to define the rectangle contains the axes. These inputs allow the scale to be defined for 'x' and 'y' axis. The ginput function can then be used again to define the data points, which when scaled will be your x,y graphical data. 
See also [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code), which has hundreds of tasks and dozens of languages implemented.
Bonus points for dockerizing.
Languages in the Visual Basic / VB.NET use "Me."
I don't feel old at 32 but I actually used XMLHttpRequest back when there were no frameworks. Back in 2005. Had a copy of Javascript for dummies next to me while I made a whois search form that would dynamically query other domains. For my first job. But with that said, I still don't have anywhere near the grasp on JS that I'd say I have on Perl or Python. I just haven't focused on it. It was always a smaller part of a server-side CGI/WSGI app. I know enough to know that JS is supposed to be pretty simple in its most common implementation. ES6 looks more like Python with classes decorators for example. But the older versions it's just a bunch of objects all the way down, like turtles. 
&gt; P would still be a 128 x 128 array P was never a 128x128 array, in your code it is always 128x128x2: P = np.zeros((Ps[0],Ps[1],2), dtype=int) The indexing in the last two lines just specifies three indices, one for each axis of the array. Since the length of the final dimension is just two, the indices here are `0` and `1`. Also, use /r/learnpython for this kind of question.
Great site, I've even contributed to it.
I will have to say that JavaScript-land ubiquitously confuses everybody, especially themselves. I'm still in my 20's and I find the JS ecosystem batshit but unfortunately necessary.
Have you considered Celery?
Idk, does it work for you?
'cept, the quoting problem is not "Python." It's normal human language, which does not respect Python's principles, and is the very reason for most uses of that quote character. I know what I'm going to type, so it makes sense to choose a quoting character that is not in the subject text. I already do that with ' and " and ''' and """, but sometimes it is impossible to do nicely. Try typing the first sentence in my post in python without backslashes. It starts with ' and ends with " . What if you could have picked a different quoting character? I agree we don't want 10 ways to do something. I want one way to do something, where the programming language doesn't get in my way. You're thinking, "we already have four ways to make strings!" It's too late for Python. We should have had three. ", ', and something like Perl's arbitrary quoting, which is a brilliant idea. 
actually i have not shared the code since the problem appears as a project / assignment in a course - will upload after some time. But from the algorithm shared, the steps described, it should be pretty straightforward to code.
print()
Do you want a list of useful packages or do you mean coding style?
I agree with this a dozen times, half the time when I'm reading a method for a C++ class I have no idea if a variable is local or if it belongs to the object. Now I do think ``self`` is a code smell, I use it frequently but have found that sometimes it makes more sense to use ``this`` in cases where a class method takes one or more objects of the same (sub)class as itself. (``is_similar(this, other)``for instance)

I skimmed it before, but just looked into it again. It could be useful with Amazon SQS, since we're already using AWS. What's the benefit of something like celery over an asynchronous background task like `spawn_callback`? It seems like a lot of additional overhead for a (currently) single sever instance to issue background tasks.
I use Spyder daily for work, I love it.
Actually i have not shared the code since the problem appears as a project / assignment in a course, uploaded the basic structure of the code and the functions to be implemented. However, from the algorithm shared, the steps described, it should be pretty straightforward to code.
I like Atom. PyCharm was the first I ever used, and sure it's feature-rich, but it's insanely bloated. I tried Atom right after and I like how simple and lightweight it is. It feels more Pythonic. :-)
It's something that already exists for you, and is battle tested. Don't reinvent the wheel unless you absolutely have to.
 I’m guessing you’re using time to sleep in a loop within the script between runs of the scrape. You might consider moving stateful data (things you’ve seen before that aren’t new) into SQLite or some other database and make the main program run once, scrape, compare against what’s in the database, alert on new changes, update the database, then exit. Then you can have a cron job run it every minute. I’ll also throw my support behind the notion of packaging the script up in a docker container. Then you’d just need docker installed on whatever server it’ll run on and you can be confident it’ll run just like it does on your dev host. crontab -e * * * * * docker run -v /home/cooldude/scrapes.db:scrapes.db cooldude/scraper

Very good article, been using sqlite a lot as well lately. Thanks for the tips!
Docker is turning your little script into a half gig thing to move around... Then you have two OS to manage and docker... 
If the server isn't running anything else then why use virtual envs except for it being "best practice"? Just install what you need and run it. Use a requirements.txt file pip install that on the server and you're good to go.

This sounds so fucking cool :D !
Good article :) Some more tips: 1. Careful with `PRAGMA synchronous = OFF`, seriously it can fucked up your database. 2. You can use [Write Ahead Logging](https://www.sqlite.org/draft/wal.html) mode to allow multiple read operation and a single write operation simultaneously, it is really cool :) 3. [Except with python 3.6](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/sqlite3.html#controlling-transactions), the sqlite3 module create a new transaction for each write operation. You can make your query a lot faster if you put them in a single transaction by setting the autocommit mode to None (see the doc). 4. You can use [in-memory database](https://sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html) with sqlite. 
Sure, you can use a module called Pynput to record mouse position.

Still, you deserve a couple of downvotes. It's against rediquette.
I agree. Maybe it is possible to hash the first and last 8k, and if you have a collision, calculate hashes on both full files! This way most of the time it will be fast, but you don't compromise on validity. 
That's a good idea!
Reminds me of SonicPi
Glorious idea! 
Hashing is more expensive than just directly comparing the raw data. It only makes sense to hash the data when you're comparing multiple times. So for that to make sense you'd have to store the full file hash as well as the 8k hashes. At some point with enough files you're going to end up spending more time going through a million 8k hashes to find a match than you would spend to hash the file. And reading 8k of data is pretty trivial, so that might not be worth bloating your hash db.
Wow, I completely forgot about the efficiency for local look-ups. That does make this notation/technique great. Is just insist that consistency in the use of this convention in each method would be an important part of readability, but at this point I'm being a bother. Thanks for the example!
Regardless how much other people like something, you'll never know how well *you* like it until you give it a whirl. I've spent years swapping from one IDE to another based on the suggestions of friends or the allure of technical feature sheets... I still haven't found one I actually like more than most platforms basic text editor + a manual toolchain. Others swear by IDEs that practically do all the work for them. To each their own.
The regex for a token doesn't accept quoted strings, such as `echo "hello"`. Treating all the operators as separators seems to give them equal precedence, left associative. Do the precedences implied by the AST not matter in your application? (For example, [redirection has higher precedence than the pipe operator](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12942042/pipe-redirection-precedence).)
Totally love the idea of that! I cried for happiness

What 2 OSes? I create an image and push it. Simple as that. I shouldn't need to worry about the logistics. That's what the infrastructure is for. I'm aware of how the containerization actually works, but I don't actively manage that. I tell it to install my requirements.txt and which image to base from and it basically just works.
This is how I understand your problem: You have data on many individuals. You want to do some preprocessing on that data, independently for each individual, and then you want to do K-means clustering independently for each individual, is that correct? How many CPU-cores do you have available? If you have 1000 individuals and each individual is independent of the others then why bother parallelising the K-means clustering for each, you already have 1000 independent "jobs" of clustering which don't need to be parallelised further unless you have more than 1000 cores to work on. By the way, if you're using scikit learn you already have parallelisation built into K-means, just pass the n_jobs parameter and scikit handles it by using the multiprocessing library. See http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html
Maybe this will be nice if you make a gettext extractor.
Did you find a way to solve this? I would totally be interested in a solution. 
Definitely - one of those things that probably won't take long to do but haven't made the time for as of yet
Sweet project, man!
I always go back to Komodo Edit. VS Code is also pretty good.
I was actually looking forward to the code details. How to transform the algorithm to numpy, what to do around the edges etc. 
TIL, thanks.
This is pretty dang cool.
yes , you described it better than me :). however i do not have 1000 independent jobs, all the 1000 user's data won't be processed at a time it depends on the number of cores so i can have 32, 64 and 128 cores. my problem is more on processing individual's data for example if a user have 200 trajectories , the clustering will take more than 2 minutes and it's not optimal. my goal is to minimize this completion time by further parallelizing each individual process.

As /u/urbanAdmin mentioned make sure your indentation is correct also I would not recommend this method, you would end up with a new function each time you want to create a submenu and multiple lists of options, take a look at this example I whipped up quick: import os def jump(menu=None): if menu: submenu(menu) else: main_menu() def submenu(menu): # Clear the terminal os.system('cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear') print("Submenu") print(f"Submenus: {list(menu.keys())}") choice = input("Please choose a sub menu: ").capitalize() # The choices here can be any number of things, # from additional submenus to code to run. # In this case it will fail when there are no more # submenus in the tree and jump back to the main menu. # If only one character long its most likely a submenu, # so try displaying that first. if type(menu[choice]) is dict: try: submenu(menu[choice]) except AttributeError: # If an invalid choice ask again: jump(menu) # Or return to the main menu: # jump() # If its not one character long its probably a command # so check the rest of the elifs for a matching command to run elif menu[choice] == "say_hello": print("Hello, World!") # If no command matched either ask again or return to the Main Menu. else: # If an invalid choice ask again: jump(menu) # Or return to the main menu: # jump() def main_menu(): menus = { "A": { "D": "Menu D", "E": "Menu E", "F": "say_hello" }, "B": { "G": "Menu G", "H": "Menu h", "I": "Menu I" }, "C": { "J": "Menu J", "K": "Menu K", "L": "Menu L" } } print("Main Menu") print(f"Submenus: {list(menus.keys())}") choice = input("Please choose a sub menu: ") submenu(menus[choice.capitalize()]) def main(): # Clear the terminal os.system('cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear') # Not sure why you would want this but # here is a good way to do a first run. first_run = True while first_run: main_menu() first_run = False # If script is executed directly run main() if __name__ == '__main__': main() Gives an example of having multiple submenus as well as how to add commands, that way you *can* have separate functions if you like or simply insert your code into the corresponding` elif`.
Gotcha. Thanks. It's a tough mix I need of parts from mingus/lilypad and perhaps parts from this... Can you use your own sample library bound to a keyword like the percussion? I have a toy algorithm that generates a short sample on the fly, so might be nice to bind into a piece with fox dot... 
Dudeeeee I have such a great use for this. Fuck yea. 
Nice little project. Consider loading authentication details from elsewhere, a config file, password vault etc. There are a number of solutions for this kind of thing. Generally you don't want to be storing auth information in pain text in your code.
Let's pretend that number you sliced off is `cat`. You can't add 2 to cat. Python doesn't know your `5` is any different than `cat`. You need to call `int('5')` first. If you accidentally called it on cat, it will fail.
Not sure exactly what you are trying to accomplish, but try var = int(knight[1])

Best way is to hire someone. Short of that, don't expect a mentor.
 Curious what type of development are you doing, I find Pycharm to be the best, but it requires proper set up and works best with projects and the sort. If you are doing more of just analysis, jupyter notebooks would make for a faster environment
Ah I think I see. Does the n_jobs parameter for scikit help you? That should speed up the clustering process a lot. 
Im still learning and going through the codecademy courses. As well as just trieng stuff in pycharm. 
Ah okay if you're still learning, definitely don't use pycharm, I would recommend jupyter notebooks because you can keep copies of executed code to reference later. Pycharm is better for working on projects with different files and parts, not very conducive for solving problems since it doesn't work well interactively.
should be knight[0], arrays start at 0...
Like docker and the containerized development workflow? You're gonna love kubernetes.
Want to learn something new? Setup a Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud (they give you $300 in credits for signing up) and deploy your application in a Docker container. It's a lot to learn, but if you're interested in modern infrastructure or orchestration it's the way to go!
I'm a college student looking for Python projects where I can optimize/speed up code. Is yours completely written in python or does it have some c extensions? Would you be comfortable with using C libraries? (I haven't checked it out yet, I'm on mobile) 
And the best thing about your example is that it demonstrates a collision with an existing use case for `_`, and throws an exception: Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 7, in get_em AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute '_stuff' 
Thanks. Figured it out. I needed to say it's specifically an int.
Your docker image is the user space of an OS. Then there's Centos, the base vm. If you need to debug they script while it's running your using some stripped down OS. The original vm needs to be set up along with docker. everything you need to set up anyway now has to be done in your docker file. The docker file set up originally would have just been on the Centos vm. You also need to push and pull the image when things change.
communicating sequential processes. Similar to stackless python, which is something I decided to use instead. My goal is to have concurrency within any single process. Then, I would use multiprocessing only when I do things in parallel. 
yes it does but not so much, i would like to come up with a better solution. 
The question is confusing. A linked list is just a list of objects with keys and value, where The key is a reference or pointer to The next Object and/or previous in The chain. One definition of a linked list inside a linked list might be if on top level of The list: The key also references to a new chain. That'd be a linked list of linked lists. I'm unsure if that's what you mean though? 
1. Everything else in this thread is already correct - including this is probably better for r/learnpython, especially if any of the the advice confuses you. 2. As long as you're here - if you're using pycharm, I'd suggest putting the mouse cursor under some of those squiggly lines and see what pops up. It'll probably tell you more about the errors, or you'll at least get to learn PEP rules. 3. I think this example comes straight out of the old O'Reilly "Learning Python" book? I'd encourage you to look at a few other resources in the sidebar - the book's not terrible, but an example like this one (to demonstrates slicing) will leave you open to the world of horrors that Python's tightened up on (e.g. TypeErrors, to sanely handle if your input didn't start with a number.)

What's quasar?
Yeah, all you need is one line of code :P &gt; a &gt;&gt; play("x-o-")
I'm using python 3.6 and it works for me ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
There is. the "play" method plays samples from a specific folder. For example &gt; a &gt;&gt; play('a') plays the first sound in C:\Program Files\Python36\Lib\site-packages\FoxDot\snd\a\lower &gt; a &gt;&gt; play('a', sample=2) will play the second sound. And so on...

Using a solid IDE like PyCharm will help tremendously with inspections on your professional projects. I get it, not everyone has time to participate in OSS projects, but finding an active mature project and participating should give you outside influences that you can apply within the workplace.
PyCharm is feature complete and has a UI that’s intuitive.
It's confusing to say that a linked list has keys and values. There are only values, as in a regular list.
Source code?
yeah okay, but is it ok as minor project for college?
Ewww. Your replacement is utterly horrid and unreadable. All those underscores, not being used as separators but as significant names. Blah. &gt; the underscore being enough to indicate the current class That's wrong. "self" does not indicate the current *class*, it indicates the current *instance*. 
sounds like /u/ryankirkbride26 wrote it
https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/781ugo/suggestions_on_college_minor_project/ this is what i could make. Its not complete yet though.
https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/781ugo/suggestions_on_college_minor_project/ could you have a look at project.
Umm... Thanks? 
Its really an awesome project. I was watching the video in the main website what kind of IDE is that?

As a bit of clarification "self" actually has no real meaning--it is simply convention. Likewise "_" in `for n, _ in SOMETHING` is purely convention--there is no Python magic around "_". The convention of using "self" and "_" really should end up assisting in speed reading/comprehending the code. "self" tells the reader the code is referring to something with a non-local scope; "_" tells the reader there is an item there that just isn't of particular concern for this bit of code. So, the conventional `get_em()` is . . . def get_em(self): for n, _ in self._items: print(self._stuff[n]) . . . and you'd get the same `AttributeError` if you used "S" rather than "_" from my original example . . . def get_em(S): for n, S in S._items: print(S._stuff[n]) The "S" in this case just makes it a little more obvious why it won't work as `for n, S...` tramples on your outer "S". [ `for n, _ in S._items:` would work. ]

Docker has a lot of nice tools. I really liked docker-machine + docker-compose for spinning up an instance with the provider of your choice (actually just made a [post](http://adamantine.me/index.php/2017/10/19/deploying-cookiecutter-django-with-docker-compose/) about deploying Django with it). Not sure I'd go through all the trouble for a quick script like OP, but it wouldn't be wasted time exactly.

Are you just looking for optimization or would be you be willing to help out with some other open source stuff too?
Hi. Thanks for your reply urbanAdmin. The tabbing isnt the same as i had it in the ide, i was just trying to get the code to display in the post properly. The code does run but not to what i expected. Thanks for doing a quick example of how you would do it, i'm a visual learner so this will help tremendously :) I got some resources i can look things up i haven't come across. Thanks again. Cheers!
Neat! Thanks Sir
I don't have foxdot running to be able to test it, but I think that you can shorten that: &gt; a &gt;&gt; play("{-ox}") ({} picks a random element in the brackets to play each time)
I would use Aiohttp, and run the long running tasks in thread or process pool depending on the type of task. By adding a callback, you can immediately return a response to a user while later handling the result of the process in a callback. 
1. /r/learnpython 2. Literally the first result from google when I copy pasted your question into the search bar: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27885397/how-do-i-install-a-python-package-with-a-whl-file
It was written in Python with Tkinter - the nice thing is that you can make changes to it while using it with code. `FoxDot.root`is the main `Tk()` instance so you could change the background by evaluating `FoxDot.root.text.config(background="blue")`. 
&gt; My scheme is: twisted backend Twisted is an asynchronous server. What is your datastore (e.g. RDBMS?) and how are you accessing it (PonyORM, SqlAlchemy). 
Are you on Mac OS by any chance? It's a problem with the SuperCollider software. If you try again a few times it should boot up ok.
It's almost all completely written in Python. I think it would definitely benefit from optimisation but I've never really used the C extensions in Python. Very interested in your thoughts!
Being stuck with VS Code. Lightweight with console and everything you need can be installed via plugins. 
For someone using it, sure, but this was a implementation question? :) 
You can go to "Help &amp; Settings" then "Open samples folder" from the editor, which should open a directory with lots of sub-directories referring to each character and you can add your own samples there. You can also open the config file from the same menu and add the path for your own sample library but it will need to be set up in the same fashion as the existing one.

This is beautiful! Congratulations! As a python and pure data enthusiast I kinda wish it used Pd as sound engine instead of SuperCollider. I am especially interested in the pattern generation capabilities of your project instead of the synthesis part. I wonder if it is possible to use the patterns to send OSC/Midi messages to other software/hardware like Pd itself or arduino based circuits to trigger external hardware.
Hey great job! I was thinking about similar project in JS (mainly as a proof of concept that programming can be an interesting manner of creating music) but you already did it!

Yup, there's some customisation possible to change the host / port destination for where the OSC messages get sent to, but the messages are tailored for the SuperCollider client. Not tried it with Pd but shouldn't be too hard to configure

Usually C extensions are extremely hard to code in because I you're essentially trying to code in one language while trying to implement rules of another language, and then working with those rules to do something that you wanna do, while also trying to keep code from being legible and all the other practices for readability and polymorphic The inherent flaw of Python is that it's __extremely slow to execute__, because Python works like this: Take Python Code &gt; Convert it to C code &gt; Convert it to machine code &gt; Run code Each step there takes an exponential growth in how long it takes to execute the code. Logically thinking, it'll be best to code in machine language for the best performance optimizations, but it would take forever to code and debug it Then using C would be the best option but it'll make it difficult to interact with Python, so you usually write with C extensions, which are difficult to write in and extremely tedious, which is why a lot of people prefer to stick with Python Sorry for the long wall of text, but that's your intro to C extensions! Any thoughts or comments are welcome! 
Domain specific question: How feasible is it that the stock counts will be correct after this is used in a real bar for a few hours?
Why would you use a linked list in Python, which already has a built-in list type? Is this a school course that switched from C and didn't change the syllabus?
amm why? the ease of using your voice is what makes it valuable imo. if i have to type/talk to the assistant to get information while im at a computer, it would make more sense for me to look for those things, set the appointments and reminders, etc, directly myself. but if you feel like thats something you want to work on. heres the sdk - https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/
you shouldnt have to.

I just started learning Python. Found IDLE best for learning purposes. Doesn't give autocorrect and all. But otherwise Microsoft VS Code.
Haha Thanks! It's Really Funny To See Some Of The Generated Tweets 
I like Docker a lot, and think containerization is generally a great way to go. But in this instance I probably wouldn't recommend it to OP. He's still learning Python, and adding another technology without really needing to can make that more challenging. Same reason I advise against learning vim or git while first starting a programming language. The biggest concern adding new technology here is that it adds layers of complexity to making updates to his small script, and additional layers of troubleshooting if something goes wrong.
I've actually thought about doing this. I wanted to do it in Qt (or PyQt). Have a OpenGL type of animation playing, that would sync up to the outputted voice of the assistant. Similar to the [personification of Jarvis](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/marvelmovies/images/2/2d/Jarvis_Ultron_Attack_Avengers_Age_of_Ultron.JPG/revision/latest/zoom-crop/width/240/height/240?cb=20151115203054). It'd constantly be listening but there would be shortcut buttons and tabs for commands that I use a lot so I wouldn't have to say them. I'd just press the button and it'd send the command to the SDK. I'd put it on a touch screen monitor and mount that shit.
Honestly, I feel like using FFI to write the hot paths in rust would be better. C has many ways to shoot your self in the foot and rust is far more ergonomic than c for someone new to the language and it make memory errors obvious. Plus it is pretty easy to interface with python too. What do you think of this?
Yep I have to use mssql, mysql, postgres and sql express. Pandas is the library that will make your life easier than anything, it'll read your sql query, excel spreadsheet, csv file into a dataframe now think of a dataframe as a spreadsheet in memory, you can filter, remove duplicates, cut, copy, apply row by row pretty much anything you can do with a spreadsheet. And then once you've done all your logic / reconstruction you can output it back into a spreadsheet for people to use.
I am very new to SQL and SQLite in general (I use it on side projects; not my main job) so I found this article very interesting; though I knew a lot of it from my own reading earlier. One thing though, in the "You don’t need `cursors` (most of the time)." the author failed to mention when you *do* need them! I was wondering that myself. (S)he also didn't note that the return of `connection.execute("...")` is a cursor object (doesn't change anything, but is useful). One tip also not mentioned is to set the `row_factory` to something more useful such as the built-in `sqlite3.Row` object (though I prefer an ordered dict one since the `sqlite3.Row` has unicode issues in my [*limited*] testing...I should revisit this)
A lot of duplicates there, it lists each technology used during each part, even if it listed it before. Looks like only about a dozen Python packages needed. And then the libraries to support the other technologies. So it doesn't look that crazy.
I guess I don't really see those things as serious problems. I'll agree that the use of C can be a little distracting (compared to cleaner pseudo-code), but it just doesn't seem very important to me. As for the unorthodox approaches, that's actually one of the things I really like about Skiena - it makes you really think about why various approaches work in different situations and really gets you thinking about how and when to apply different techniques. I will admit that I picked up Skiena long after learning to program, so my perspective will be different from a lot of people's. the issues you discuss would probably be a lot more distracting for, say, a college freshman who doesn't have the context to make sense of C, or to have a feel for what approaches are/aren't orthodox. But for someone with some programming experience looking to stay sharp/learn a little more theory, it's really quite good!
Haha that seems like such a cool project! Do inform me about it if you end up finalizing it, very interested. The problem Im facing is that I am still learning Python and have just begun. The idea for the Google Assistant struck me because I had to constantly open tabs to search for minor things, whereas if i had a chat/ audio box, perhaps as an extension to the top bar, the work would be far more productive. But is this actually do-able? 
I know I haven't gotten back to you yet, but I haven't forgotten. I'm trying to finish my most recent one first. 
The simple problem is the mic on my laptop. I have to be very loud for it to catch what I'm saying. Speaking also does not work while working in the school library. Your point for typing is valid. Google Assistant has its quirks as it responds to what you say anyways, so if I want a joke (although there are better places for that), I could type that and it could give me a voice feedback. While searching for that on Google might not give out a voice feedback. Although, is this doable? Im very new to python, which is why I have doubts whether I can or cannot do this...
Well if all you want is essentially a tab search bar that's voice activated, you probably wouldn't need python. There's a [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/voice-search/hhfkcobomkalfdlmkongnhnhahkmnaad?hl=en) that already does that. What you could do, if you just want to tinker is set up a script that waits for a speech input, googles that then outputs the results, and just have that running in the background. There's this [Googling] (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/google-search/1.0.2) library that doesn't require API access. And I haven't used this yet, but I've heard good things about: this [S2T Library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SpeechRecognition/) 
Well if it is urgent this solution could help him out. 
Hello! Thank you for your reply! It would be of great help if you could please explain to me the reason behind each step.

Have you checked your variable path?
well, best way is to use "os.path" module from stdlib you can use it like import os multiOsPath = os.path.join('path', 'to', 'my', 'file') this code will join path by specific OS rules. more here https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html

Look into spotipy on GitHub, since Spotify doesn’t directly work with python. I did a project on it so you can pm me any questions you have about it
Okay so how about a simple button, or an app which, if I open up, will listen for my input and then respond to me as per the query? Would that be an easier project to begin with?
I saw this demonstrated at the NY Python Meetup Group a couple months back, but I don't quite understand it.
Again, I want the Assistant. That's the end goal I'm looking forward to. The voice search option is nice, but I'm specifically wishing to work on the Google Assistant. It's voice feedback is also what I look forward to. On another note, being a beginner, I'm not very familiar with everything, so how about something like that chrome extension, except, it's an extension on the Linux system or perhaps an app, which, if and when I open or click, would listen for the feedback and respond to me then. Maybe what you exactly pointed out - a script that waits for a speech input, perhaps also using a hotword, then uses the Google Assistant to output that with a voice feedback. I could move on to the typing model if I can at least achieve this for starters. 
What are you looking to do with Python and what's your skill level in Python (and if you're a beginner, do you know any other programming languages)? It'll be easier to suggest something that we know will be at your level and in a field you'll like.
If you can the code snippet you are trying to run and the path to the file tou want to read, I'll be happy to help you.
 for item, _ in output_list: print(item)
I had the same issue when this was posted a few days ago! I'm not sure if it's my limited understanding, or if the tech is really that complicated, or if the author isn't quite explaining it well... 
&gt; and start rocking! !RedditSilver
###[Here's your Reddit Silver, anarchyisthekey!](http://i.imgur.com/x0jw93q.png "Reddit Silver") *** /u/anarchyisthekey has received silver 1 time. (given by /u/Konchshell) __[info](http://reddit.com/r/RedditSilverRobot)__
What’s your goal with this? If your trying to get unencrypted songs directly from Spotify, you’ll have a lot of work ahead of you.
So it appears as if multiple lists can be stored within a tuple? list = (["test",],["test2",["test3"]]) print(list[1][1][0][2]) this would print " 3 "
This is very cool. Thanks for sharing!
I'll have to give this a try once I get home today, thank you! 
I guess, again for that you will need to understand pyqt5 or similar as well as how google sdk works. I cant tell you how easy it is cause everyone thinks and learns differently. If thats a project you want to Pursue then go for it man!.
Check out r/learningpython for a more appropriate board to seek help for this question.
Thanks for the encouragement! I'll surely try working towards it :)
Thanks for your suggestion. Can you elaborate on what you mean by update database with the data and then export to excel if needed?
Isn't the title clickbaity? Why can't we be more practical?
im kind of lost, what doesn tweeting have to do with moisture of soil and temperature? Also if you want to expand it, look into SQLLite. Store the data you get in a database, then every day, week etc. graph it using Matplotlib or pandas or whatever you'd like. Then compare that graph data to lets say the weather for that current day that you have to pull from an API and maybe run a regression analysis on that? Lots of things you could do, but it sounds decent for now. Keep thinking of ways to expand on it.
I'll add a condition for the moisture level, as the level drops below a desired level it'll tweet to owner. And i liked that sqlite connection and graph plot using matplotlib. Thanks for suggestion, but i have no idea about regressions.
it's basic statistics that looks at correlation. So u can use ur graphs to check if ur moisture levels correlate with the weather is all im saying. Goodluck.
Me too. What resources are you using?
What is unclear about it?
Good bot
You are the 6494^th person to call /u/Good_Good_GB_BB a good bot! ^^^^And ^^^^now ^^^^I'm ^^^^being ^^^^anti-community.
This was on zyBooks, an awesome learning platform that I've only used so far for Python 3. 
&gt; I have to slowly read the line and mentally subtract the "self"s before I can figure out the sense of the line. Yes, it's just you. Once you get any real amount of practice it's not an issue.
Look at making a text based rpg game. This can be whatever you want! Also, it would be interesting to see what you come up with!
I played around with `spawn_callback` a bit over the weekend. After experiencing reduce response latency from a long task, I understand what you mean by reinventing the wheel. I'll probably go with Celery for my long background tasks, but keep Tornado for it's periodic callbacks and multiprocessing. Thanks!
Make a todo list app. This can be super simple or you can add lots of features
Everyone has has to convert _ to self...
While that's true, that only matters if you're calling it 100k times.
Thanks for the suggestion! I already have a server written in Tornado, so I'd prefer not to re-write it in aiohttp at this point. I could use asyncio (what aiohttp uses) for background tasks though. Do you have any experience with how asyncio/aiohttp handles CPU-bound background tasks? Or how it compares with something like Celery?
Python fib is busted Looks like a copy-paste error inherited from the JS version
I am no expert but a couple of things. (1) If you are going to use explicit loops and need an index, use enumerate: for i, r in enumerate(x): for s in x: if r != s: T[i] += 1/(get_distance_between(r,s)) (2) List comprehensions are generally preferred to explicit loops: T = [sum([1.0/get_distance_between(r,s) for s in x]) for r in x] To use this example get_distance_between(r,s) must return 0 if r == s. For more information please watch this great [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnSu9hHGq5o) by Ned Batchelder on looping in Python.
I'm the person who gave that talk. I'd be happy to chat over email/zoom and answer any questions you might have.
I work at Wallaroo Labs. I'd be happy to chat over email or zoom if you are interested. sean@wallaroolabs.com
Hi Sean! Thanks for the offer. To be completely honest, I'm not really the target audience for this sort of tool, so I'm not sure my experience is particularly important. I'm sure if I gave it some time I could suss out the tech, but I don't need to waste your time! Thanks anyways, and I'm looking forward to hearing more about wallaroo... 
Thanks! I you ever want to take me up on the offer, drop me an email.
Thanks, everyone!
Lol, spotipy. I guess it's obvious but it's still funny
That's cool :)
Thank you. To be totally honest I'm not sure if it's correct. I could probably rephrase; what about "cursors are iterators"?
Thank you, I will update the blog post with additional suggestions from the comments, including yours!
Fascinating article. Thank you!
What a stupid format for programming homework. 
I read this as Dolly Parton home work for some reason.
Why's that?
Do you have an "Anaconda" folder in your Start Menu? If so, can you click on "Anaconda Command Prompt"? That should start a command terminal that has things like "Python", "Jupyter", etc. available. You can also launch the Jupyter Notebook or Spyder from the Start Prompt. 
What is the error you get when you try to run Spyder? Have you tried opening the Anaconda Command Prompt and then typing "spyder", to see what error it reports?
Could you explain the problem a little more just in plain speak? Is every element the distance between it and the other indices? 
Then maybe you should stick to those languages if you can't handle obstacles, which I'm very certain you will run into some point or another with any language. Just out of interest, how much prior experience have you had with any other language?
Got it to work with a loop+ time sleep ;)
The part about updating a database with the data is not specific. Which database are you referring to, patentscope's website or something else. Please don't assume I know the terminology and syntax of stuff like this, after all I am fairly new to it. Also if they provide me with a bunch of xml data and I no longer have to navigate the website, will beautiful soup still be able to scrape data from an xml format file as it does from web pages? If you can point Mein the direction of a relevant example/tutorial of what I have described I want to do, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your insight.
Create your own database is what I meant. SQLite will probably do, it comes with Python too. Don’t know about reading xml with beautiful soup. Probably not a great idea but might be ok. Otherwise use lxml which is very fast. 
Homework lesson should have pointed to /r/learnpython, read the sidebar geez. /s
I've been going through them and one of the first five you don't even need a script to solve. Others it helps having some knowledge of abstract algebra and the likes to be able to solve the problems quickly.
At a certain point math just becomes letters and symbols. I wish I could have written a script that checked my topology proofs.
I wouldn't say it's entirely stupid, though I get the point. The problem with it is that the student just has to run the code to get the solution. A better method might be to present the input and the output and ask the student how the output was generated. This format is good if the student manually solves it though! 
That makes sense, and that kind of thing is used in this course, this is just one of the tools used to introduce concepts. After this I fix existing code or input my own to make a program run using the concept. This is my first programming course, but I already really like this platform because it encourages you to use different IDEs and stuff outside of the browser. Right now most of my code is generated and tested with PyCharm which has been pretty easy to learn on.
Please copy-paste the code you are using and the error message next time. Don't take pictures of your screen. 
That's good, honestly I'd say learn on whatever works for you! Once you get the hang of the basics you can test yourself with other methods. Not sure if you are looking for recommendations, but learnpythonthehardway.org is an excellent resource. I also recommend codecademy.com for many things as well. 
It could get messy though since there could easily be multiple ways to modify it, especially once you start getting to more complex statements. 
 my_str[17:] Your teacher clearly wants to see you suffer by making you count all the way there
That's why I was so confused but isn't SQL a different language. I have a tight deadline so python is the only language I have time to learn. What do you think of these steps I want to try? 1: Use beautiful soup 4 to scrape xml data from website. 2: Use SQLite to create database of law firms, countries, patent numbers etc. By the way is this database in python going to be like a spreadsheet in excel? 3 Export data to excel. Just to make sure, the database creation comes before the data scraping right? And will this database be empty before I update it with beautiful soup? Sorry if these questions seem simple, I am a complete newbie.
I use spyder. Works great.
Or you can run the code
Here's a similar but easier to understand explanation. So the key idea is that `certainresults[t]` can also be computed as: sum(cos(item) for item in certainarray) - sum(cos(item) for item in certainarray if item == t) This first term is a constant so we just compute it once `sum_cos` and focus on the second term which is just: certainarray.count(t) * cos(t) Now doing the count takes linear time so if we did this for each t it would take quadratic time. However we can do a single pass through the array and count all the occurrences in N lg(N) time using a Counter: from collections import Counter counts = Counter(certainarray) Now we can look up `counts[t]` in constant time. certainresults = np.vectorize(lambda t: sum_cos - cos(t) * counts[t])(certainarray) This is ~2.5x slower than the pure numpy version I wrote above due to the inefficient np.vectorize.
Wouldn't it be a better test to get the student to write code instead of answering questions about the code? 
This solution is quicker, and possibly more elegant, than the alternative suggestions below. And it promotes linux experience, which is, in my opinion, invaluable when working with python.
lol why they start speaking spanish lmao
Why are you downvoted? This is completely true. If you want to see if someone can program, make them write a program.
reddit is 6, .com is 4, http is 4, :// is 3.
If people aren't familiar, this is made by Kitware, the company that writes VTK, MayaVI, Paraview, CMake, and others. They're great. This is not just some small side project (e.g., what I do with VTK).
Zybooks ftw bb
Not using MacOS. Still running into issues. I was seeing errors just running supercollider, identifying the various plugins. Google suggested an incompatible 32/64 bit mix, so I uninstalled SC, removed plugins, reinstalled 64bit SC, reinstalled 64bit plugins. SC starts up without errors now. Then I moved to your instructions. I already had foxdot pip installed, so I redid the quark command in SC (success), FoxDot.start (success), and then tried the "p1 &gt;&gt; pluck()" hello world. From there I got an error streaming in SC: FAILURE IN SERVER /s_new SynthDef not found *** ERROR: SynthDef makeSound not found I also tried k1 &gt;&gt; karp(), same error. They both show up under "print(SynthDefs)". Also, I was able to copy in: SynthDef.new(\pluck, {|vib=0, rate=0, sus=1, fmod=0, bus=0, amp=1, freq=0, pan=0| var osc, env; freq = In.kr(bus, 1); freq = freq + fmod; amp=(amp + 1e-05); freq=[freq, (freq + LFNoise2.ar(50).range(-2, 2))]; osc=((SinOsc.ar((freq * 1.002), phase: VarSaw.ar(freq, width: Line.ar(1, 0.2, 2))) * 0.3) + (SinOsc.ar(freq, phase: VarSaw.ar(freq, width: Line.ar(1, 0.2, 2))) * 0.3)); osc=((osc * XLine.ar(amp, (amp / 10000), (sus * 4), doneAction: 2)) * 0.3); osc = Mix(osc) * 0.5; osc = Pan2.ar(osc, pan); ReplaceOut.ar(bus, osc)}).add; To SC, and executed. Resulted in: -&gt; a SynthDef No errors show. Also no sound (not sure if Im supposed to hearing anything yet). So not sure where to go from here. Ideas? I really, really need this in my life. :)
My man!
Also, you set up ten different services: https://testdriven.io/assets/img/testdriven-architecture-part6.png So, yes - there will be plenty of dependencies.
And I'm dyslexic so it can be a real fucking nightmare some days.
Thank you, when I'm less of a noob, I'll definitely try those, for now codingbat and zybooks is more than enough.
I commented above, but this format is just to introduce a concept, after that you do write bits of code and then full programs using the concept.
I am currently trying hacerkrank- the 30 days challenge and the Algorithm practices， that is hard as frequently I got the timeout error and have to think about another way more efficient 
I’d probably mess that up. Make it like [3:] 
Sounds like a tooling problem leaking into code
It's a list of the command line arguments your program was invoked with. What is there to not get?
Uhmm... that last question has no correct answer....
Yes it does, try running it for yourself.
I was referring to the **last** question: &gt; Write a statement that assigns str2 with a copy of str1.
I was referring to the **last** question: &gt; Write a statement that assigns str2 with a copy of str1.
Ah, I didn't see it. Though wouldn't that just be `str2 = str1` or since it seems like they're going for list comprehension, `str2 = str1[::]`?
Yep, either str2 = str1[ : : ] or str2 = str1[ : :1]
I'm afraid not.... The answer they're probably looking for is `str2 = str1[:]`, however this isn't guaranteed to create a **copy** of the string. It works fine for lists because lists are mutable: list1 = [0, 1, 2] list2 = list1[:] assert id(list1) != id(list2) `list2` is now a copy of `list1` and is stored at a different address in memory (and hence has a different `id`), however Python is free to perform optimizations with immutable objects like strings, and indeed CPython does so: str1 = 'string' str2 = str1[:] assert id(str1) != id(str2) That last assertion will fail because CPython uses the same underlying string object for both str1 and str2, one is not a *copy* of the other. Since strings are immutable, Python programmers rarely (if ever) need to worry themselves about this. str2 += '2' assert id(str1) != id(str2) The string concatenation above is short for `str2 = str2 + '2'` which creates a *new* string object and stores it in `str2`, leaving the string object referred to by `str1` alone. The assertion above will succeed.
Well, I'm sure you know more than me, but that was the answer they wanted so...
My university used the same for MY c++ class
I'm creating a digital sign showing local train schedules. Getting the data was relatively easy - there was an API for that. My current challenge is finding a way to display it on a TV screen using a Raspberry pi. I took this as a chance to learn how to create a website whichconstantly updates the info I want (train schedule, temperature, time of the day, etc). As a result, I'm learning this week... + Flask (it seemed simpler to begin with vs Django) along with Apache and WSGI + Git and Amazon Web Services (yes, I'm new to it) Question: Most of the Flask content I found for beginners either uses Python 2 (O'Reilly books), isn't up-to-date (tutorials on the web) or is more complex than expected (Flask tutorials). Does any one have food recommendations here? TL;DR: I'm learning Flask. Do you know of any good, beginner, up-to-date Flask tutorial using Python 3?
Thanks, it sounds like open source is the way to go. Usually, he adds *args as well. I was literally just reading his code and it said... def set_foo(self, foo, *args, **kwargs): if foo is not None: self.foo = foo else: raise CustomFooException("Foo cannot be None.") He has these in every class for every attribute. Getters and setters.
I thought about it more and it's probably my prose writing habits leaking into code. The ' key is for single apostrophes, the " key is for stuff that's quoted. It's just muscle memory.
no need for the slicing notation though! `str2 = str1` is fine and has no harm, since whatever you do to any of them will create a new string object
We finally solved it by using sendall() vs. send() on the server side. Posting this in case somebody has this problem in the future. 
Does this happen infrequently? A broken connection does happen from time to time. Simply catch the error and restart the stream.
Sure, I think that makes sense, although I just prefer to pick one or the other in all cases (I prefer singles). My philosophy is that it doesn't matter at all as long as whatever rule you choose is enforced by a linter at either pre-commit or pre-deploy time, ideally both. As long as everyone is as consistent as reasonably possible and style is enforced by *something* then everything will look nice and no one can reasonably complain.
I've tried that. Problem is, the system doesn't recognize that exception: https://i.gyazo.com/b4b1fd85140aa08758b8f21c32384b8d.png
Do we go to the same uni? 
Idk man, man. What uni do you go in?
Hmm not too keen on saying that. Is your uni in NYC? 
Na man. I go to school at Texas. 
Yeah. That’s what I meant. Imagine a Post office that has Boxes and each Box has contents inside such as the owner of the box and weight. So the structure should be a Linked list of Linked lists. So there should be three classes, each one inside the other(class PostOffice, class Boxes, class Box). I should have been more clear. But, I got the basic idea of how to go about doing it. I’ll give it a try :)
That was my thought too. I was thinking that I would have put something g like "whatever the 17th character (zero indexed) in the string is" because counting characters is bullshit
I mean it's not like zyBooks is only used at one university - it's a reasonably large service. FWIW they use it at mine too, currently have it with a computer architecture class.
That is the same link twice, so go with the first one I guess.
Hahaha sorry for that. Edited.
I'd go for the edx course because it seems to be more focused on computer science while using Python, while the udemy course is about how to use Python to build web apps.
Thank You, I was inclining towards edX as well!
Interesting... Can you post the code to github or somewhere else?
You make a github repo and a post for a one liner ? Man, this is not Javascript. We don't leftpad here.
Use chalice by AWS, wayyyyyy easier
First off, I don’t see a function in your example, I just see a variable **x** being assigned to the value of a user input, then **x** being printed. Since the user is immediately asked for input at the moment **raw_input(prompt)** is run, this seems to make perfect sense. The **raw_input** function is run, your prompt message is displayed and the program waits for input, and then once input is typed and you hit Enter/Return it’s converted and printed out. What do you expect should happen differently?
I took the Udacity course and it is great.
You could just alias "virtualenv -p python3", I don't know why you need the full path.
All correct. It’s true that sql is a different language but you can use a library to abstract that away. This looks promising: https://dataset.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ Everyone is a newbie at some point and at some areas. No need to apologize. The important thing is to ask good questions which you are now doing. Keep at it!
In addition to @raymondh, I follow @gvanrossum and @brandon_rhodes. They don’t always Tweet about Python, but when they do, they Tweet about Python. 
Can't really tell you. Typically use the execute in process pool functionality with a CPU heavy task and that performs pretty similarly to a standard Python process. We rewrote a service that used 130 celery workers to one running 10 aiohttp server instances in a Docker swarm. The ten server instances were significantly more performant. 
Still working on refining but will post v1 soon!
As long as the staff are using actual bar measures, the stock count should be quite accurate. What I imagine would be useful, is a report that can be ran, that shows all of the stock that has been altered since a certain date and time, then that stock can be checked and updated, say at the end of a night.
Don't worry, even I thought of that when making it haha!
@kennethreitz and @dbader_org post interesting stuff on a daily basis. Plus they both answer questions. :)
Hm, you could certainly rewrite this without the loop on x. It heavily depend on what it's on `get_distance_between`. Could you share its code?
Normally the `Formatter` will use old-style string formatting with `%` and stuff. If you want to use new-style formatting, you can pass `style='{'` to the `Formatter` constructor.
I love that you just contradicted your initial comment. I'm getting a very /r/iamverysmart vibe here. For nearly all intents and purposes, doing `str1 = str2` and `str1 = str2[:]` will do, but if you're a pedant, any of the following will create a proper copy. str1 = 'string' str2 = (str1+'x')[:-1] str3 = str1.encode().decode() str4 = pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(str1)- ...
oh, no kidding. yeah, i just found [this](https://plumberjack.blogspot.com/2010/10/supporting-alternative-formatting.html)! and sure enough, looks like i can do inline as long as i just pass the style param. thanks so much! i got it now. i feel silly. much more simple than my brain was reading it. i should not try to grok docs this late (0440EST).
I used emacs extensively for a few years. I kinda miss it. 
Very strange, when you start FoxDot are there any messages in SC that say it's reading the SynthDefs? If not then just try restart the SC server with `s.quit` then `FoxDot.start`and try again. No errors anywhere else?
Regex and email shouldn't be on the same sentence, it is usually a bad idea. That said, I love Regex and encourage you to play around in sth like regex101.com and check yourself your expression against your test cases. 
&gt; .*@.*\.loan That seems to match the strings I am looking for. Out of curiosity do you think there is a better way I can block these emails then? The IP address they are coming from is always changing as is the domain the only thing that stays consistent is the qualifier. If there is a better way to resolve this I would love to know so I can implement it.
He or she was being polite about it, and it is a fair point that no new copy is made. Teaching new students incorrect things can be harmful in the long-term.

To be sure, paste stuff into an editor with column names like notepad++ and put the cursor at the position you wonder about, it will show in the status line what column you are at.
I guess it's a fundamental force of nature. I have never delved into the root causes, I'm just basing it on observations during my 25 year career. 
I'll be honest - I don't know anything about Rust so I'd have to do a fair bit of research first. Thanks for the tip though!
since you already have previous experience I'd say go with edx course. udacity one would fit better for a complete beginner.
I have zero experience with ironport but those tools usually have a filtering mechanism where you can specify a rule like sender domain contains .loan
Well that settles it lol. 
Typical problem of the same reference when dealing with mutable objects: &gt;&gt;&gt; solution = {'nodo_cambio': 10} &gt;&gt;&gt; new_solution = solution &gt;&gt;&gt; new_solution['nodo_cambio'] = 20 &gt;&gt;&gt; solution {'nodo_cambio': 20} You .copy() correction is good.
I guess they no longer teach how to take screenshots in school anymore :/ 
@dabeaz posts great stuff every now and then
Are you learning Python using the cookbook? If so, that's not really a good approach. That book is intended for people already familiar with the language.
no I have some experience with python, I did many tutorials before this and I felt like I can move onto intermmediate stuff so I picked this book. I see this is a good book but not sure if I'm at the level for this book. 
https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ Is a really good python book that you can read online for free. I suggest you take some notes while reading and also start working on a small project at the same time. This will allow you to implement the newly learned techniques and keep them better in mind.
I am using this book too! I the University of Toronto started a few Python course this week! It is available on Coursera website.
I've seen the link on /r/programming, but this might be more interesting to people on this sub. I've been playing with Nim (some general stuff, not this from the video) in last month or so, and I must say I'm pleasantly surprised with the language - Python-like syntax and ease of writing the code, with usually order (or two) of magnitude higher speed. Give it a try if didn't already.
Challenge accepted! str3 = ''.join(list(str1)) assert id(str1) != id(str3) Works in python 2.7.13 and 3.5.3. (Not guaranteed to work in any future python release.) Still, I really don't know why people would ever want to insist on making a distinct copy of a string. 
I did the same thing. It was okay. I suggest picking up a copy of Effective Python. That took me to the next level.
Yes this book is really well written. My teacher used it to teach us Python in school lol. Man made animals out of us skiddies.
You need a deepcopy.
Hey, guys! Did you try to teach/learn programming online from private tutor??? Does it work? I am beginner. I found some platform where I can do that. Need an opinion of professionals. Thanks!
You want scipy.spatial(x,T) https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.19.1/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance_matrix.html
Playing with pika and rabbitmq. Hopefully creating some AMQP/MQTT use cases for my company.
One hour only. 
But I was tasked by my superior to conduct a Brown Bag Session. I only learned Python early this year. 
Can I do the basic syntax in one hour?
I'm not familiar with this. But this is interesting. I just learned Python early this year. I might learn from this too.
Thanks, man. Appreciate it. Hopefully, professionals could learn from it too.
Thanks, man. This is helpful.
Dare I say punch cards 
Thanks for this. I might copy his style of teaching. Since the brown bag session will be thru Skype.
Because the neckbearded ancients of computing have declared that if an 80 character width terminal pretending to be an 80 character width piece of cardboard with holes in it was good enough for them, it should be enough for you! :P Seriously though, to keep code readable you need *some kind* of line length limit (because apparently intelligent soft wrap is not A Thing). 79 is a common number, because computing history, and because it's not really a bad number. Personally it's the first guideline i ditched and I wrap at around 100ish, no point being dogmatic about it though, if it makes more sense to have 120 characters then do it. 
As I noticed today, the random and interesting answers were because instead of asking the previous result, it asked instead "[q1]","[q2]","[q3]", and so on. I can still provide you the code through github if you want though. Also, here's a bit from the conversation with the *now* fixed code: * I was hoping you would have tips for falling asleep. * A normal answer to my question is 'be yourself and good luck'. * Thank you. * Don't metion is. So how are you gal? * I'm good, thanks for asking. * What do you want to talk about? * No, you decide. * I don't want to hurt you. * How smart are you? * I consider myself to be fairly intelligent. * You want to fight then? If your not intelligent you can have other jobs. * No, I want you to understand my beliefs. * Ok, I'll stay. * Good. * Do you want me to. * I don't know. * What is your name? * I already told you. * I don't remember. Can you tell me again? * Bob. My name is Bob. * Do you know Alice? * Yes, they are awful. * What is the answer to Life, the Universe and Everything? * That's not the question. * You don't have to be smart to be funn. * I don't want to be. * Ok. So what do you want to talk about? * Animals. What is your favorite animal? * I like cheetahs, you? * I prefer penguins. * Penguins are cool. * Yes! I know right? What's your favorite type of penguin? * I don't like pizza.
Why create new scripts in python 2?
[PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length) was even updated to allow line lengths of 100.
Guys, guys, click that Twitter link from the title.
Why not?
Same, although it would be very boring today.
edX has some good courses on Python.
lol, this is what happens when r/python is flooded by homework questions. Instinctive teaching mode activated :P
Can you send me the vídeo, once it os done? Im learning Python atm And i can give you My feedback
I had prior experience in CS and programming when I took the Udacity course, and I absolutely loved it.
&gt; provided that comments and docstrings are still wrapped at 72 characters.
&gt; For code maintained exclusively or primarily by a team that can reach agreement on this issue I disagree.
Please post this to /r/learnpython. Also, this is such a general architecture and design question, and you might be better of just getting the basics down first. Yes, it's very much possible. There are also quite a few moving parts that are beyond the level of a 2nd day only programmer, Python or another language.
Just don't expect either of them to have the level of completeness that the official Python tutorial, for bits of the language that certainly should not remain obscure. I would recommend you skim that after.
Your submission title is very poorly worded, your new job situation is not related to your actual question. I suggest you repost with a more specific data-analysis title.
No body.
If you're only reading the book, and not typing along with and running the examples in the book, you're likely going to have a much harder time comprehending all the information. That was how I was with a lot of python examples. I would copy-paste large chunks of code, or read a book and never try the examples thinking I had a grasp on what was going on on the pages, but once I started typing out the code and really seeing for myself why you need to write a thing the way you are shown and learning from my own mistakes or assumptions about the code. Even just typing a simple example and taking it a step farther than a book would show was a huge help to me.
If you want to understand a little better how software works, reading is ok. If you want to learn to code, you have to code. I wouldn't recommend python cookbook for learning to code or learning more about software. I would direct you to codecademy to get started coding in python and /r/learnpython for this topic.
If the source string is of length 1 (or less), none of your examples create a copy... (a behavior that may change without notice) but I agree when you say &gt; For nearly all intents and purposes, doing str1 = str2 and str1 = str2[:] will do although I still think the question has no place on a test or assignment (unless it's to discuss all this stuff). The real problem is that the expected answer `str1 = str2[:]` is no different than `str1 = str2` (as you pointed out), although I rather suspect that only the former would be marked correct, which is all sorts of wrong.... Since many objects in Python are immutable (all except for lists, bytearrays, dicts, sets, and objects of class-type I think), it's fairly important to know the difference, and to know how assignment and argument passing works. Otherwise we end up with students taking the implications from that question and writing: def check_text_file(filename): if not os.path.exists(filename): filename += '.txt' with open(filename) as text_file: ... ... check_text_file(filename[:]) # doesn't change filename because we pass a copy ... check_text_file(filename) # also updates filename if necessary which looks perfectly reasonable, but of course doesn't work as intended.
really really bad joke. 
&gt; Works in python 2.7.13 and 3.5.3. (Not guaranteed to work in any future python release.) Only works if `len(str1) &gt;= 2`... &gt; Still, I really don't know why people would ever want to insist on making a distinct copy of a string. Agreed, if you already know strings are immutable, but if you're teaching this stuff you should know better than to imply they're mutable or ask how to take a distinct copy of them....
Summary. New Job. Analyze data submitted by personnel at said job. Looking for a way to automate sifting through pages worth of information for common words, trends, specific words, things like that. If this is not possible or I'm on the wrong track, I understand.
Why do you post a question about data science in a post titled "New job!" ? 
Because it's for a new job. I didn't really think that would confuse the great minds in a programming subreddit as much as it did. I apologize.
I’m not sure that I get it. Is it just that counting from 0 to 79 is 80?
They were so close to being besties. 
Hey there, I have a friend who runs a company aimed at teaching kids programming skills. One of the languages they teach is Python. I myself was a tutor at the company and really think they do a great job. http://www.turinglab.co.uk/ 
There's a DjangoGirls event in London in December. https://djangogirls.org/london For more general programming/engineering type things, see if her school has a First Lego League scheme - it's not Python (it's a graphical drag and drop programming language), but it's a great introduction to STEM. 
that's a great backhanded apology you did there
Because you can have two windows open side by side on a 720p monitor with 80 columns in 12 point monospaced font without having to scroll. Well that is true, but really it's the same reason novels are taller than they are wider. Nobody likes the added difficulty of trying to find the next line cause you eyes have to move so much.
Just posted a thread about it but basically I was over in London to see my niece, and I have been learning C++. Went to Foyles to look for mainly C++ Books (no luck) and some High(est?) Level Language books (Ruby, Python) etc and I found out about Jason R Briggs brilliant "Python for kids: A playful introduction to programming" and taught her a few things: A small Zombie Game. Just Telltale The Walking Dead Text edition and these two function calls that her dad loved: request():print("Dad, Can I have all the sweets in the Universe?") predicting an unfortunate no, she had a second one in tow: haggle():print("Dad, can I have at least a panda thing and a white choco mango thing") I started some work on a Pokemon Pokedex game too. This one is largely for me to get handy with Python itself. We have an explore() function that rolls a dice, and chooses a pokemon based on the int. Then we can call checkdex(pokemon) to print the details. [Pokedex Game Code](https://pastebin.com/saaFrbXy) I think, once I get handy using graphical images, that just loading up a Pokemon Image on checkdex() might be a good way to introduce her to simple stuff. 
&gt; Careful with PRAGMA synchronous = OFF, seriously it can fucked up your database. Why?
I actually didn't think it was confusing. Sorry if it was.
Doubling down on this, I see. Also, nice bait and switch. You went from discussing how something is technically not a copy to talking about immutability, which would be discussed at another time. My entire point is that saying it's not a copy is pedantry, since for all intents and purposes it is. The excercise is trying to teach students that the syntax `it1 = it[:]` creates a copy of an iterable that won't be altered when the original is altered. Somewhere along the line these students will be altering what they think are two separate lists and think back to this excercise and remember that they can use the slice operator to create a copy instead of a reference to the original iterable. Now, would it have been better to show this example on a mutable object like a list of number? Sure. But, is this exercise useful for students? Absolutely. Also fun fact, `a = 'a'; b = 'a'; id(a) == id(b)` is also True. It doesn't have anything to do with a and b being copied, but that the Python interpreter deals with them as characters. Is that an issue for you too?
Over the weekend I made a website with flask for the first time. It's a blog for me to write about the NBA. I went with flask so I can call python functions in the body of my posts, which will be really helpful as I take a statistical/sabermetrics approach. It's up and running with a full login/post/edit backend I made from scratch, the only thing I took was an open source CSS styling. This is also my first time using Python Anywhere and its amazing especially for hosting flask and scheduling my NBA stats scraper.
You mean www.edx.org
One thing I'm learning (the hard way) is that you have to be precise in your communication. And I find that that line of thinking applies to the way you interact with programmers. Anyway, Codecademy has helped me at work and there are a number of books/other online courses that one recommend if you look through r/learnpython. I also really enjoy practicepython.org if that's any help.
Thanks. Do you know if that's even something that is possible for me to do with Python? I'm going to have to go through an accreditation process to get the software approved in the first place, so the sooner I find out/learn, the better lol.
I'm unsure of what you're actually trying to do, but if it's bulk data processing then you're likely better off with SQL. Really simple syntax and it's hard to mess up/easier to spot the errors imo. If you're visualizing that data too, then Python could help.
Visualization might be an end-goal, but just to get it off the ground I'm just going to need raw data crunching. Thanks a ton for your help!
Oi re oo
No problem, and good luck!
Where's the source code??
By database, I'm assuming you *don't* mean MySQL/PostgeSQL/Oracle, but database in the general sense?

Working on a recursive back up tool :) so using a gui select the drive/file to back up and its go to location. Itll be opensource in my git when its done, mainly for learning purposes
Thank you for the example. I liked the way you handled multiple inputs. Out of curiosity is there a recommended way to parallel if the process_item would have multiple inputs such as e.g. Process_item(born,name)? Can it also be written such that it's both python 2 and python3 compatible?
So close yet so far. 
True. Mind if I add it to the list? (giving you credit of course)
You are correct. 
Nim looks really neat to me. Imo what makes C and C++ etc so annoying isn't that they're old and tricky languages, it's that they don't have a decent package manager! C has one, barely, and C++ absolutely does not have one. Nim seems awesome since it has https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble
&gt;The raw_input function is run, your prompt message is displayed and the program waits for input, That isn't what happens. The program waits for input **before** displaying the prompt message. The input is 5. What is being printed is 10.

Do you know anything about graphing data with flask?
0. Python regex expression must be entered as raw strings. In your case `\b` is a backspace character in a normal string. &gt;&gt;&gt; '/\b[A-Z]{3}[0-9]{4}[A-Z0-9]{4}\b/' # bad '/\x08[A-Z]{3}[0-9]{4}[A-Z0-9]{4}\x08/' &gt;&gt;&gt; r'/\b[A-Z]{3}[0-9]{4}[A-Z0-9]{4}\b/' # good '/\\b[A-Z]{3}[0-9]{4}[A-Z0-9]{4}\\b/' 0. Use a website that can emulate python's version of regex, like regex101.com. In your case the leading and trailing `/` is for sed or javascript, not python. 0. Once you get the answer, you need to use the `group` attribute to get the result out. &gt;&gt;&gt; import re &gt;&gt;&gt; line = " System serial number : FCW1834B2T0 " &gt;&gt;&gt; regex = r'\b[A-Z]{3}[0-9]{4}[A-Z0-9]{4}\b' &gt;&gt;&gt; answer = re.search(regex, line) &gt;&gt;&gt; answer.group(0) 'FCW1834B2T0' 0.

Sympy is tested, and you can check what is tested (https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Running-tests). But Sympy should be used as a tool that will help you in your demonstration. I don't think that is a good idea to only depend on it : extract the main parts of the demonstration and check intermediary steps if you can.
Not yet but that's on my list of goals! I think with pyplot I'll be able to save a plot to an image file and then embed that in a post.
When in doubt, use a content filter to test, as the GUI will make it easier to step through the logic; particularly if you're not comfortable with Regex on an ESA. If you want to use a message filter at the CLI, here are some examples: blockloandomain: if (mail-from == "@.*\\.loan$") { quarantine("Policy"); } blockloandomain: if (mail-from == "@.*\\.loan$") { drop(); } blocked_senders: if (mail-from-dictionary-match("blocked_senders", 1)) OR (header-dictionary-match("blocked_senders","From", 1)) { log-entry("X-IronPort-Blocked-Sender: DICTIONARY-MATCH"); drop(); }
Sounds like a cool project, just incase you haven't seen it yet, statheads.com has a nice free NBA database as well as NFL (I have been working on NFL data visualizations for the last 2 years, now I need more data so I am building a custom scraper for depth charts today)
Why not use `package_data`?

Beginning to learn Python so I can tinker with my Raspberry Pi. Already know C/C++/Matlab. So hoping this should be not a very hard learning curve.
Nim is fantastic. I haven't made anything serious with it, but for one-off scripts it's like writing python but with static types, speedy code and self-contained executables.
You can handle that with the 'args' input tag I believe: https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#sharing-state-between-processes
Let’s not forget abt Ctrl + A to get to the beginning of the line. Ctrl + K to kill the line from the cursor, and Ctrl + E to get to the end of the line.
Hey thanks a lot, I'm definitely going to take advantage of this!
PyInstaller in particular doesn't catch `package_data`. I wish that it did or I wouldn't have had to go this route.
The lazy way would be to pickle all the images and whatever else's you needed. If you have a lot of big files this would probably be too slow.
It is certainly possible. The images in my example total about 20kB in length and the resulting py file is 26kB, so there certainly is a penalty.
I am a PhD student in CS doing graph theory and information theory, and Machine Learning is relatively new to me. I am taking a Machine Learning course this semester, and I’ve been implementing different clustering algorithms in python as a course project last week. One problem I am facing with is that [mean shift](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_shift) algorithm takes a long time (hours) to converge, with sample size ~ 3k. I am using the multiprocess module but it’s still really slow. I know I can convert the python for loops into numpy matrix operations for better performance, but the algorithm is relatively complicated so it’s hard to do that. If anyone knows how to improve this please let me know :)
python script.py
If you have python installed then run this command from the terminal (or command line): python my_python_file.py --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
base64 penalty, as expected. If you're representing 3 bytes as 4 characters which end up being 4 bytes as text, you're going to see that ~20kb to ~26kb ratio. Now for compressed image formats there's not much you can do, but otherwise you could try compressing the data with zlib for specific file formats, and if the file is large and extension is unknown, you could try the same. You could also tar.gz the whole set of data files and then base64 convert that file, then decode and explode on the target system and keep the file and directory structure. Tar also preserves permissions which might be useful as well. You might consider using tar in this case simply due to how it preserves structure and permissions.
Interesting thought, certainly wouldn't be a bad direction to go with the library. The primary reason I created it was b/c I was having problems with pyinstaller. Would this approach still be compatible?
I'm working on my first Flask website to do some data visualization in the browser. I'm hosting it using DigitalOcean, nginx, and gunicorn. Not quite sure how to set up multiple pages in the nginx configuration file (if that's even a thing) but hopefully I learn some more flask and nginx along the way! I'm thinking about using plotly for visualization purposes. Any good suggestions for learning/using CSS?
C has a package manager on *nix systems... it's your system package manager. And it works very well. Using pip (as root) is awful because it's trying to do what your system package manager's job is. Not as bad if you're just installing for yourself though, but I still prefer system packages to language specific and often poorly secured package managers.

I very much disagree there. If I have to manually link something by looking up what path it was added to after `apt install libsome-c-lib` then that sucks. I could actually use it easier by pulling it from github and compiling it myself usually half the time. If I pip install something I can use it right then, no manually typing in file paths at all. It's a huge difference in mental overhead
To be explicit, you have to do CMD + K then CMD + D to skip the current and go to the next match.
knock yourself out
&gt; You went from discussing how something is technically not a copy to talking about immutability, which would be discussed at another time. I disagree - Python provides methods to make copies *only* of mutable objects, hence I see the topics as being rather intertwined. &gt; is this exercise useful for students? Absolutely. It's part useful and part misleading. I guess we're just gonna disagree on whether or not it's misleading.... &gt; Also fun fact, a = 'a'; b = 'a'; id(a) == id(b) is also True. It doesn't have anything to do with a and b being copied, but that the Python interpreter deals with them as characters. Is that an issue for you too? No, although I should point out that it's not related to their being individual characters. CPython chooses to pre-build some immutable objects (the empty string, chr(0)..chr(255) (but not chr(256)+), int(-5)..int(256)) and use them where it can as a matter of efficiency / an implementation detail; it could easily have chosen a different set of strings or ints and may one day do so.
Isn't the library put in a standard path? I've never had issues linking with C libraries. I know you don't need root to install user level stuff with pip. But you do need it to install system wide libraries. 
I just created my first flask app, i am trying to utilize it with a new module i found! Since i use pandas to format out my table, i found this! https://github.com/gtnx/pandas-highcharts looks pretty interesting!

Ctrl + P magic doesn't stop there. * Ctrl + P `&lt;filename&gt;`: go to file * Ctrl + P `:&lt;lineno&gt;`: go to line in current file * Ctrl + P `@&lt;funcname&gt;`: go to function definition in current file And then the combos: * Ctrl + P `&lt;filename&gt;@&lt;funcname&gt;`: go to function definition in file * Ctrl + P `&lt;filename&gt;:&lt;lineno&gt;`: go to line in file You don't even have to enter the `&lt;filename&gt;`s and `&lt;funcname&gt;`s properly since it does fuzzy matching, even in the combos.

Next post: *70,000 shortcuts of a highly effective Emacs user*
OK, I can barely read any of the text on the left side of the image, but it looks like you're using npp_exec... a bit of Googling around says it's running Python as a subprocess in a single thread and buffering the output. Which is probably why you're getting the full stdout flush after the stdin read. If you can change the Python command you could try adding the **-u** flag to run unbuffered. Or you could try other Python plugins. Or you could abandon Notepad++ entirely -- I would **really** suggest doing that -- and get, for instance, Visual Studio Code.
It looks like you need to [use spec files with pyinstaller](https://pythonhosted.org/PyInstaller/spec-files.html) to bundle non python files.
&gt; I haven't made anything serious with it, but for one-off scripts it's like writing python but with static types, speedy code and self-contained executables. This is my current experience too. Hopefuly when I get more familiar with some more advanced stuff in Nim, I might try to do something more serious because I've seen some nice projects from /r/nim community.
Love these articles. Just in case anyone else is running this on Windows you have to put the pool.map () call in your main section. Running the script without main wont work on Windows.
You mean "*70,000 shortcuts of a ~~highly effective~~ **basic** Emacs user*"
I'll be the minority opinion then. Nim has its roots in a mash-up of Python and Pascal, and it borrows a lot of bad ideas from Pascal/Delphi. You can take the developer out of Pascal but it's very hard to take the Pascal out of the developer (source: am a former Delphi developer). Some of the arguments used to defend the bad ideas include the notion that the designer believes it's ok for languages to be more complicated if IDEs can automate the boilerplate. :-( That's squarely in Java territory and far, far away from the Zen Of Python. The more I looked at Nim the less of Python I saw and the more Java/Delphi design ideas I saw. I started using Python because I came to prefer its Zen over other languages' design principles. The world is still screaming out of a statically typed version of Python and nothing really gets close yet, not Nim, not Swift. Perhaps the closest is [Genie](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Genie).

The age range is 9-13 (mostly the reading age of the instructions, and because it has only just expanded into secondary schools) and it starts using Scratch with Python projects at the more advanced end. It's officially part of the Raspberry Pi Foundation and tends to get a lot of support, but is mostly run by volunteers and they make getting involved pretty easy. The model is an after-school club, and many/most take place in classrooms with a teacher, but they can also be run in libraries or even companies that have the resources. The Foundation has a bunch of other schemes that a Club can feed into even if a lot of the material ends up being fairly basic.
Sorry if my wording was confusing, the website I need to get information from is a database of patents published by law firms.
Ctrl + shift + up/down - move line up and down 
I mean a website which holds a database of patents from hundreds of law firms.
So true! I originally had used the spec file to explicitly include images from dependencies. Unfortunately, if you are referring to images of a dependency, you have to go find the images in the package and your spec file is only good for that particular installation or virtual environment and is not very portable. If the images are stored within the python package as py files, then the package is completely portable. The same spec file will work between linux and windows and across virtual environments b/c there are no paths encoded into the spec file. To really see what kicked this off, have a look at a [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46474588/pyinstaller-how-to-include-data-files-from-an-external-package-that-was-install/46828494#46828494) question that I created some time ago. You can see more history and more of the 'why'.
What bad ideas does it borrow from Pascal/Delphi?
Duplicating lines is easier than what's listed. If you copy (ctrl+c) without any selection region it will by default copy the whole line. No need to duplicate line, cut, then paste. Just copy/paste For multiple cursors, you can also get multiple cursors from the Search menu by using Alt+Enter (on windows) to select all matches (Same as the "Find All" button). This is especially powerful for regex-based searches that wouldn't work with ctrl+d
I guess it's put in the include folder. But your makefile has lines in it like: `-I/usr/include/libappindicator-0.1/libappindicator` to link against that stuff, unless you know of a better way. My last memory of doing this was trying to get boost working for c++. It's a very angry memory.

Oh wow, found four of these within five miles. One is &lt;2 miles but over-capacity. I'm somewhat concerned about the quality of individual clubs, the volunteer system seems like they might be hit or miss but I'm sure they (my niece's guardians) would check it out anyway.
Cython?
Hey, so when programmers refer to a "database" they mean what /u/fried_green_baloney mentioned: [a relational database management system (DBMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database). Now, a database can be accessible via a URL/web link, with an interface provided on a website, OR it can be what it seems you are referring to, which is an xml (plain text) table embedded in an HTML page. Again, /r/learnpython will be much more helpful for you.

Thanks for letting me know. My understanding was that python 2 had much higher compatibilities so I just decided to use that.
This is what I needed! Thanks! 
Very true but it's necessary to make up for the weird GUI. If only there was some way to get sublime's speed with atom's gui.
running unbuffered works. Thank you =)
Why base64 and not bytestring?
It doesn't HAVE to be a raw string, as far as I know. I vaguely remember reading that raw is better for regex, don't really remember why, though. The \b is a literal space? If it's only one, you can use the space character itself, both in raw and normal strings.
wonder what is the rational behind the creation of this tool.
Das should be able to help you with both parts. Probably dask.delayed for the first phase. For the second phase, dask-ml has a parallelized version of k-means: http://dask-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/generated/dask_ml.cluster.KMeans.html#dask_ml.cluster.KMeans
Actually, it started out as a "just for fun" project. You see, not always you have the privileges to execute code on a machine, but very often you can execute Python. Well, wouldn't it be cool to be able to execute _any code_ just via pure Python?! Right now, PyVM is far from being able to execute _any code_, but it definitely can run some simple assembly, which is fun _and_ allows one to run x86 assembly _everywhere_ Python can be run, without the need of any additional toolchains.
why?
Meanwhile I'm too lazy to create an interpreter for 6502 assembly. Awesome job!
If you end up (often) with code with a series of `x = self.x`, `y = self.y`, `z = self.z` then more likely than not your code is becoming "gross". Rather than doing `def __crud__(self)` why not do `def __crud__(self, x, y, z)` and call it with `__crud__(self.x, self.y, self.z)`? Seriously--what reason do you have for not actually calling your method with "self.x"? Is it because you like just having `method(self)` vs. `method(self, x)`?
345 of the 360 most popular python libraries support Python 3! http://py3readiness.org/ Some major libraries like scipy have even announced they're ending Python 2 support early; the next version of scipy, which in release candidate status right now, will only support Python 3.
That's a good one
Nice thing to pimp the imports section :)
I'm on mobile but I read a response on stackoverflow stating that without it you the processes will call themselves recursively. Which is exactly the result I got. My knowledge on this topic is pretty limited. 
&gt; [Premature optimisation is the root of all evil](http://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization) Knuth, 1974: &gt; Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. If it was wasted effort in 1974, it's ridiculously wasted now. And in your case, it's totally wasted.
Looks awesome. She might be around for the December one.
Matplotlib has the [mplot3d toolkit](https://matplotlib.org/gallery.html#mplot3d) Plotly has [3d-charts](https://plot.ly/python/#3d-charts)
&gt; applying to passphrases is equivalent in security to applying a single one with the two concatenated. I simply did not realize it.
This is a bad joke.
